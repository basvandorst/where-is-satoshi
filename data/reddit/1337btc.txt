There's an ongoing active smear campaign against coinbase on this sub because their CEO has chosen to support big blocks, which makes sense since higher transaction volume = more people using bitcoin = more customers for coinbase. Also I see my previous comment saying the same thing was deleted with no explanation. It seems people mostly get upset with coinbase for enforcing AML / KYC, which they *have* to do because they are a US company. If they didn't, they would face fines and prison time. Overall, coinbase has done a lot to make bitcoin more easily useable and accessible for the masses..something this space desperately needs. The fact that some people have chosen to attack Coinbase purely for political reasons is something that I personally find quite frankly disgusting.

This is a HUGE problem that Bitcoin hasn't solved. Merchant companies, whether Bitcoin-based or not, simply *refuse* to do business with any industry that they deem Morally reprehensible, or supposedly "high-risk". 
This means firearms companies, vaporizer companies, Mushroom Spore companies, Herb companies (ie: kratom), and dozens of other industries that might sell items that are considered "high risk"  still have an EXTREMELY difficult time finding a merchant company too process payments for them. Which means we have to pay high, inflated rates for the company that actually won't turn you down.
These industries are getting fleeced and fucked over, paying 5-10% for a merchant processor. And Bitpay and Coinbase are not any better. 
What we *REALLY* need here is a way too install Bitcoin acceptance into our websites without having to go through a centralized service such as Bitpay or Coinbase. So far, I have NOT found an easy way to do this..
Some developer needs to get paid to step up and develop a software platform for easy website integration that makes it easy to accept Bitcoin on your website and get paid in Bitcoin WITHOUT having too go through any kind of centralized service. Seriously. Bitpay and Coinbase have proven themselves no better than First Data or any other large merchant company in this regard. This is something I would be willing to donate to.
Someone please step up and make such a platform a reality!

@_date: 2015-06-20 00:08:06
Well, what it basically boils down too is big banks telling you what you can or cannot sell, as the merchant companies go through the bank's policies. A lot of items that aren't illegal fall into gray areas with these banking policies.
Yes, I do take offense that some stiff at a big bank tells me I can't sell my harmless freaking mushroom spores, and it does piss me off that Bitpay/Coinbase are in the same boat. This results in unnecessary headaches and higher prices for everyone. 
The federal government also puts pressure on the big banks not too take payments from firearm/porn vendors, which is simply unfair.. this is not FREEDOM at all.
Which is why I was ranting that we need a way too be our own merchant processor through bitcoin, aka an easy to integrate platform for our small business' websites, without having to go through an intrusive and centralized service. There is a serious Need for this service. Then I realized this platform actually *DOES* exist already with mycelium's gear payment system.
So, vendors rejoice. Looks like mycelium is doing something really awesome here, and they deserve recognition.

Because these "solutions" are unnecessary, are years away from being finished, and will probably be centralized requiring KYC and whatnot. All the dev team has to do is introduce thin blocks and an adaptive block size, but they want to make things difficult... and more importantly, they want to make profit.
@_date: 2016-03-26 14:11:24
No, they have no plans to increase the blocksize to 2mb. They will delay it as long as possible, unless the BTC community forces them to do so.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:14:48
3% is super low and chances are they might not be making any profit at all during price volatility. People should not expect owners to operate at a loss to their own benefit. Anywhere from 5-10% is a fair price IMO 
@_date: 2016-03-09 17:00:50
And Core has not become obsessed with other people's money how.....? They are forcing an artificial limitation of the blocksize to profit off sidechains. They are certainly not untouched by greed. We never should have had a company with VC funding take over bitcoin development.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:09:58
1 to 2 percent above coinbase? Are you serious? So you expect the BTM owner to operate at a loss just so you can buy in on the cheap? Come on now, be realistic. You are the one being greedy.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:13:11
I don't think people should complain so much about the fee to use a BTM. It's not as easy to own and operate one as you think, and there's a significant amount of costs involved. You would probably need to charge at LEAST 5-6% above market rate to break even, 10% IMO is completely fair, given the convenience.
Sellers on LocalBitcoin regularly charge 10-20% mark-ups and some times they don't even make profit after price swings. Get real and stop complaining. If you think 12% is too high, then go to a different one or wait 4 business days to buy in through coinbase.
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:50:20

Neither are you for making that assumption. The solution is not to leave blocksize at 1 MB forever. We are indeed crippling the network.
@_date: 2016-03-31 17:23:50
I really think the issue of node centralization is a myth. This study has concluded 90% of currently run nodes could handle up to 4mb. Furthermore, I believe that if the need arises for blocks bigger than 4mb this would correlate with a major BTC price increase. Most node operators would be easily able to afford bigger blocks with such a major BTC price increase, therefore you're still getting paid, and there will still be a diverse array of node operators, thereby avoiding "node centralization". Jeeeez, there really is no good reason not to *ATLEAST* increase the blocksize to 2mb immediately. And we could likely handle a 4mb blocksize without issue.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:40:04
4mb is an arbitrary maximum. It can go much, much higher. Anyone saying otherwise is either wrong or spreading FUD. Satoshi said himself that the eventual solution is to "not care how big the blocksize gets" in his own words. Everything can scale on-chain with far less infrastructure investment than VISA or mastercard, but Blockstream wants to profit off these arbitrary limitations by forcing everyone onto off-chain solutions.
@_date: 2016-03-26 14:17:26
No, there is no immediate centralization threat with a blocksize increase unless transaction volume actually increases by a factor of 10 or 20. That would obviously take time. Yes, the cost of running a node will go up but the bitcoin price would also explode exponentially if it starts being used in such massive volume. I think this "centralization" would be a myth, because a diverse array of individuals would still be able to afford running nodes, especially with a major BTC price increase.
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:29:40
And yet he made a lot of valid points. The lack of scalability is destroying bitcoin's ability to add new users to the network, it's crippling growth at a time when we need it the most. How do people not see that? If Core cripples bitcoin and it never achieves it's fate of becoming adopted on a mainstream level, then yeah, it's not going to change the world in the way that it could have - and most people will still use Fucking paypal. No one is talking about centralizing bitcoin - we just want a fucking blocksize increase which should have been implemented months ago.

Gavin also predicted, a *year* ago, that blocks would start being full around March 2016. His prediction was spot on. Anyone with half a brain could see that this would eventually be a problem. Blocks were already approaching capacity weeks ago, so anyone who didn't have their blinders on knew that this was going to happen. Call it a "spam" attack all you want, the reality is that overall tx volume is going up due to normal use - which is a good thing. But if we stop bitcoin adoption dead in it's tracks due a to a lack of ability to scale, then we have a big problem on our hands.

"In HK, Alex asked me to “respect” his time by agree the consensus asap. Also someone else told me he had bought long position just before the roundtable, if we did not agree, he would lose huge financially. If it was not these two, I would probably have escaped away that night."

I don't know, desperation? Fear? Cowardice? Either way it's not working, you are right about that part. However it certainly has managed to force some node operators offline. The fact that Classic/XT/Unlimited nodes are the ones being attacked points to a core supporter of some sort, since core seems to be unaffected.
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:45:28
So the solution is to cripple the network and leave the blocksize at 1 MB forever? Even if they raised the limit to 8MB I doubt it would that dramatic of an increase. You are talking about a problem which probably wouldn't materialize for at-least several more years. Limiting the growth of the network and bitcoin adoption, at a time when we need it the most, in response to this potential problem is not the answer.

You're talking about a long-term effect on node operators. However, a simple 2mb increase right now won't really hurt them. In the long run it's something to think about as the network continues to grow, but right now it wouldn't hurt anyone. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:29:41
After a bit of research it seems that most node operators could handle a blocksize increase of up to 20 MB without huge increases in cost. That would be enough to keep us going for several more years, no problem. By then LN would be finishing up development. But nope, gotta keep it at 1 MB forever for some unknown reason.

So you weren't doing ANY of your transactions through escrow? You were directing EVERY SINGLE customer towards a direct trade? That is understandable for local face to face transactions, but for online methods it's a huge scammer redflag. Even if you weren't scamming, I can easily understand why they banned you - directing *every single* customer to avoid their escrow system makes you look like a scammer at worst and a cheapskate at best (avoiding the 1% fee)

German Intelligence Operatives leaked the information:
The official UN death toll is a complete fabrication. For whatever reason, they don't want people to realize just how intense the combat taking place was and they don't want people to realize the full scope of the Dying that has taken place there under Kiev's orders.
German Intelligence revealed 50K people died, and that was BEFORE the debaltsevo operation, where another 4-5k people died in combat.. so 60-70k total sounds about right for the total conflict.

Around 5-10 civilians are still being killed or wounded daily by Ukrainian Army shelling. The total loss of life is somewhere around 60-70 Thousand people killed, with most of those deaths having occurred during the summer and winter offensives. 
Of course, all this is mainly only happening in eastern ukraine. However, the rest of the country is still suffering very badly in economic terms, with the Ukrainian Currency having devalued by over 50% or whatever it was...
Edit: I would like to add that there is a very good chance Kiev will launch another offensive, resulting in 10's of thousands more deaths. The front line could change if the separatists launch a counter offensive. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 00:48:48
Well then from my perspective you are completely intent on believing whatever the western mainstream media tells you. It's not a fact that russia has invaded, because they haven't. The higherups at the pentagon all know that the majority of the conflict is between eastern ukrainians and Kiev, but they push the false narrative anyway. Russia does supply the rebels materially with ammunition, but they do not send troops. If they did not help arm the rebels, and the republics were conquered, the USA (who basically completely controls Ukraine at this point) would use Ukraine to launch a suicide attack against Russia resulting in the deaths of millions. Of course the goal of such a suicide attack is not to actually win a war, but to further damage Russia as much as possible. The sad truth is that we have complete psychopaths running the foreign policy in america, while Russia is doing their absolute best to get everyone to stick to the Minsk ceasefire agreements. 
Here's a good article from a former ukrainian politician who tried to run against poroshenko. He was kidnapped and nearly beaten to death for his efforts. It's a complete freakshow over there.
@_date: 2015-07-28 12:45:47
You have people in these volunteer battalions (specifically Right Sector) who view Stepan Bandera, a man who ordered the deaths of thousands of innocent people, as a national hero. Just sayin' - it would not surprise me if they carried out terrible atrocities, even if that particular story is a fake.
Moving on, the different examples I could list are innumerable. I guess these are the primary Lies pushed forward constantly by the MSM. There are smaller fake stories that push these main agendas. 
"Russia invaded Ukraine and illegally annexed Crimea"
The main falsehood agenda that is constantly pushed by the MSM. First of all, Russia never invaded Ukraine. After the coup in Kiev and the emergence of an openly anti-Russian government, many ethnic Russians in eastern ukraine were concerned and began large scale protests. The new Kiev government cracked down on them with overwhelming force, killing and detaining a lot of people. Then the Odessa tragedy happened which pretty much forced the beginning of the civil war between Kiev and pissed off Eastern Ukrainians. Despite all the smoke and mirrors, this conflict has mainly remained an internal Ukrainian conflict, not an invasion by russia. Both sides have foreign volunteers, but there is no real evidence of significant movement of actual Russian troops into Ukraine, and the Pentagon knows it. So Kiev is constantly fabricating fake stories and using the SBU to set up fake stories of capturing dozens of Russian troops. Laughable. If you ask me, it's pathetic.
As for Crimea, the people there wanted to join russia. 95% of them voted to do so. Their decision was influenced by the fact that Right Sector thugs had just brutally killed a few Crimeans who were protesting in Eastern Ukraine earlier. That is a fact. But the USA was butthurt because they had plans to take over the military base at Sevastopol. Infact they already had plans to renovate the whole place and use it for their purposes, plus they wanted to deny Russia their only main Navy base in the area. They did not expect Putin would pull this maneuver. It's a good thing he did too, or else all of the Crimeans would have been occupied by the armed volunteer battalions and drafted to fight into the war by Kiev en masse, and they would have died in huge numbers.
"Russia or Russian-controlled separatists shot down MH17"
All this propaganda despite their being significant radar evidence that a Ukrainian Su-25 jet, most likely armed with air-air missiles, was shadowing MH17 at the time of the disaster. MH17 also had its flight path altered by Ukrainian Air Traffic Control to fly specifically over the warzone, whereas other commercial flights avoided it. Both Kiev and the USA have tried to cover this up.
Secondly, eyewitnesses reported as early as June 2014 that Ukrainian attack bombers were using civilian air liners as *cover* during bombing raids over Slaviansk. This video was originally uploaded on June 18th, a full month before the MH17 tragedy even occurred. Clearly, Ukraine played a major role in the MH17 tragedy, and yet the USA tries to push the "Russia did it" agenda (which is false).
Yep, those are the 2 biggest lies I've watched unfold and people, sadly, believe to this day.
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:13:23
Yes, the intensity of the fighting in the Eastern regions was a lot higher than the B.S. figures the UN put out.
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:10:28
I agree with you on all points, except the death toll.
German intelligence revealed a minimum of 50K deaths back in february, BEFORE the Debaltsevo offensive when many more thousands died:
I have been watching this conflict and reading military updates since the beginning. The official UN numbers are a complete lie and fabrication, for whatever reason, they don't want people to realize the true scope of the conflict (probably because it would look bad for Kiev since they sent 10's of thousands of people to their deaths.)
The majority of deaths are Rebel troops and Ukrainian soldiers, plus volunteer battalions. The Ukrainian Army has lost somewhere around 20-30 thousand men killed, and so has the militia. In reality, both sides vastly understate their losses. Overall, the Ukrainians lost more men killed than the militia because of the numerous times Ukrainian Army ended up being surrounded in cauldrons during failed offensive operations, resulting in thousands of their men being killed at once by artillery fire with no way to fight back.
During the Southern Cauldron alone when Ukraine Army soldiers were surrounded and pounded with artillery, the Ukraine Army lost somewhere around 3 thousand men killed. That was during ONE operation. During the Ilovaisk boiler, Kiev lost somewhere around 1.5k of their most battleworthy men. Ofcourse Kiev claimed they only lost 100 men in the ilovaisk disaster. They are very good at covering up their losses.
During the Debaltsevo encirclement, the militia managed to encircle Debaltsevo and Kiev troops eventually ran out of ammunition. The troops stationed at Debaltsevo were forced to retreat under heavy artillery fire. It is estimated by independent bloggers (who I find to be a lot more truthful than official sources) that Ukrainian Army took losses somewhere around 2-2.5k men killed during this operation, while the militia lost somewhere around 1k men killed. Again, the reason for the disparity in men killed is that the Kiev troops were under operation encirclement and forced to retreat under heavy artillery fire.
Anyway, you can see my point that multiple thousands of people die in a single engagement. The UN numbers are way, way off base. This is an extremely dirty, bloody war,  and I hope it ends soon.

Here are more sources about losses related to Debalcevo from Cassad's blog (Cassad is a crimean with pro-separatist views, but I find he is honest in terms of losses, he does not downplay the numbers when it comes to death)
I would go back further in time for more sources but I don't really have the time right now. The battle for debalcevo summary article was extremely interesting.

Yes, but it's not that big of an increase. It might take us up to 1.5 mb, at best. Also, people are having transaction issues right *now*. Companies that would be investing in bitcoin infrastructure right *now* aren't doing so because there is no scaleability right *now*. Segwit won't be done until April at the earliest, and even then there might be delays. Meanwhile, blocks are getting filled to capacity, and everyday a blocksize increase is delayed, potential network growth is denied.
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:57:53
I'm not saying it's 100% that the su-25 shot down mh17, but you cannot refute the evidence that mh17 was shadowed by the ukrainian air force the entire time as radar evidence has shown, also that it was ordered to fly directly over the warzone by ukie air traffic control, and it was ordered to lower its altitude. These are all facts.  But anyway now we are just getting into trivialities.

Now you're just spreading FUD. You'd have to be a moron to think Gavin doesn't have Bitcoin's best interests in mind. Now, Adam Back, who thought Bitcoin was stupid until it hit 1k, is suddenly interested in bitcoin. Is he anymore trustworthy? Doubtful.
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:44:19
To me it just sounds like you're trying to justify the creation of the Lightning Network. Bitcoin was not termed a "settlement layer" until very recently by various unknown individuals. Bitcoin has functioned just as fine as a currency up until now, and the only reason there is even a problem is because the max blocksize is being artificially limited on purpose for exceedingly unclear reasons.  There is no reason, IMO, that a majority of the transactions can't take place on the blockchain (as was originally intended) with a little bit of ingenuity. Don't tell me it's impossible, I'm sure there's a way.
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:02:43
You are wrong on every single point. Western propaganda is vast and far reaching, and it comes from dozens of different sources. If you can't see your own bias, then I can't help you.

A hard fork would be fine, especially if it's needed to allow the transaction volume on the network to continue to grow, something which Core doesn't like apparently.
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:26:46
Thank God. Core's "roadmap" towards "maybe" having a hard fork towards a blocksize increase in 2017 is insane. Why do they keep delaying and delaying and delaying? Transaction times are going to continue going up, limiting the growth of the network, while Core continues to attempt to transform bitcoin into whatever weird vision they have for it which isn't really in line with the original version of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:19:43
Hope you don't mind waiting until July 2017 to "maybe" get a blocksize increase! Thanks Core! Can't wait for fees to rise dramatically and transaction times to slow to a crawl while we wait!

Personal attacks against Gavin are particularly low just because he doesn't agree with you. And how exactly is he wrong again? There are a lot of issues with LN which needs to be addressed - and if you click on the link, he says we need both LN *and* a blocksize limit increase (not just one or the other). In other words, he is willing to compromise. Seems pretty humble about the whole thing to me.

It's funny how so many people on here are normally so quick to praise coinbase, but now that they aren't supporting Core, for the obvious reason that Core is strangling the growth of the network and attempting to permanently delay a very much needed blocksize increase, now suddenly Coinbase = bad.

LN seems like it would definitely have value, but for it to be forced on all of us by Core through the artificial limitation of the blocksize (and subsequent fearmongering by them on how an increase would be bad) is an extremely unwanted event, and furthermore it decreases trust in Core's leadership substantially.

The DDoS'er in his own words on why he is attacking classic nodes using his botnet:
"Just paid, I'm professional ddoser lol. Don't know why someone want to bring it down. Maybe increasing block size will decrease miners profit? I'm using bitcoin a lot but don't care about it's politics too much, XT had too fast block size grow rate which looks unrealistic to me. I think BIP100 is okay since it allows voting and also bitcoin unlimited also seems like good idea and looks simpler for me. If classic will fork to 2mb blocksize and it would be not enough then what? Next hard fork? I think protocol should support miner voting by design."
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:29:08
You are being ridiculous. Classic is not going to cause anyone to lose money.Core might though, if they continue to restrict the growth of the network be keeping the blocksize artificially low. There are very real concerns with Core, including RBF which now allows for scamming to take place on what was supposed to be non-reversible transactions. Thanks a lot Core. Whether you like it or not, there will continue to be disagreement for the foreseeable future, but don't try to make it out like it's completely baseless. There are a lot of people concerned with the direction core is taking us right now.

Ukraine is in a permanent state of civil war thanks to the USA and the CIA purposely causing a coup and installing a fascist puppet government that then attempted to launch a proxy war against Russia, but instead got a civil war between east and west Ukraine. Over 50 thousand people have died in this conflict with several million refugees pouring into Russia and Europe. 
So, no. Bitcoin will not change Ukraine. What the people in Ukraine need to do is overthrow their fascist puppet government (Poroshenko) and return to peace-time conditions. That is the ONLY THING that would help Ukraine at this point.
Unfortunately, Poroshenko and his army of brainwashed neo-nazis have the full backing of the United States along with all their logistical and intelligence aid so good luck with that.

Because credit card processor companies monitor what you sell big brother style and will shut down or deny you a payment gateway entirely if you sell Vape products. And if they do manage to get a payment gateway, they are probably charged anywhere from 5-10% in fees because they are "High Risk." For this reason, BTC is extremely attractive to any business that sells supposed "High Risk" products, because then they can skip the 5-10% in fees, and don't have to worry about getting shut down by some overwatching moral authority.

Classic is not a dead end diversion. Some people think on-chain transactions are superior to unproven off-chain scaling solutions. It's merely a difference of opinion. There are a lot of people who agree with Gavin, more than you would think. So, calling it a "dead-end diversion" is highly disingenuous. It's an open source project and people are free to do what they want. The problem is you view Gavin as a threat to Core, which is not true.

We need a blocksize increase now. Blocks are currently at capacity. An early fee-market before it's necessary only hurts bitcoin and promotes the rise of alts. Core, stop stalling, or you will be replaced.

Gavin has contributed more to the bitcoin space than many other people. He doesn't owe you or anyone else anything at all, so there is no need to be condescending. It only makes you look foolish.
@_date: 2016-05-20 02:42:23
Stalling, stalling, stalling. People are moving to altcoins now. We should've had 2mb blocks yesterday.
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:42:55
Lol, keep telling yourself whatever you need to hear. There is an obvious split in the community, on both sides of the spectrum. I don't see why we can't implement both bigger blocks and segwit/ln. Then everyone can be happy.
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:03:40
That is their business choice. You are setting a dangerous precedent by attempting a hardfork to destroy competition. Not a good look for bitcoin. This kind of tech could help home miners.
@_date: 2016-05-11 02:31:11
If you really think Gavin is evil, I don't know what to tell you. You are misguided.
@_date: 2016-05-07 02:45:20
A simple yet poignant truth. I wonder why all the downvotes, eh?
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:49:31
JVP is not part of some scam. He genuinely believes CSW is Satoshi. Just because you have that opinion does not automatically mean you're a fraudster. You need to get your head checked.

Who the fuck cares? It's reddit we're talking about here. This place isn't exactly known for intelligent discourse. Half the threads are full of morons spouting bullshit. You can choose to listen to whoever you want. If you want to believe the wacko conspiracy theories about Gavin working for the CIA, or being an accomplice to Wright then be my guest.
@_date: 2016-05-30 23:21:58
Stupid thread. Lots of companies go bankrupt for a lot of different reasons. Supporting hard forks does not = business failure. Stop grasping at straws with this stupidity
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:02:56
Yes it's a scam... they will take your bitcoin payment and then never send a thing. Then you find out it's some guy from nigeria who made the website.
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:51:49
So basically the same as American public opinion. Got it.

The prosecution's own government witness stated that Mark was under investigation by them for 2 YEARS and that the prosecution made a deal with MK to hang Ross in exchange for immunity. Nothing more has come out because the judge forced this all to be redacted and instructed the jury to cover their ears and forget he ever said anything.

BTC can't handle the amount of users currently on the network which is causing massive transaction delays for some users. This has contributed to the rise of certain altcoins, including one which shall not be named that has now reached a valuation of over $1 billion - a first for an altcoin. Meanwhile, an increase in BTC's blocksize to 2mb which should have been done 2 years ago still can't be agreed upon in 2016. Now the halving is coming up and the BTC price probably won't go up significantly, meaning lots of mining operations will become unprofitable... all in all, we're in for a bumpy ride.
@_date: 2016-05-23 21:19:29
Thank God for Antpool. Finally, a voice of reason. Core, the ball is in your court. Stop being fucking jackasses and give the people what they want - a blocksize increase for on-chain scaling. If you refuse to compromise, you will be replaced and made irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-05-21 14:53:12
Perhaps, but what about the transactions that still can't fit in the block? There is still a bidding war for fees and transaction times are still going up for those who don't bid high enough. That is not good for bitcoin. I serve a lot of customers on paxful/localbitcoins and the vast majority of these people have no idea what is going on. There is no need for a fee market right now. Do we really want BTC's transaction fees to be on par with sending bank wires ($20-30) in the long run? It's ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-05-06 23:47:54
LOL, so wanting to scale on-chain transactions in line with satoshi's vision is a "CIA-backed movement"? GTFO shill.
@_date: 2016-05-07 16:14:08
The number of throw-away accounts  recently registered shitposting about Gavin is off the charts. So yes, I do believe it's a concerted smear campaign.
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:52:20
Ukraine is in the middle of war frenzy. Thousands of random people in Ukraine have been detained and pulled off the streets and accused of "separatism". It only makes sense they would attack Bitcoiners at some point. I feel terrible for anyone living in Ukraine at the moment, it is complete psycho world over there, if you express Pro-Russian sentiment there is a good chance you will be detained and tortured or executed.

Karpeles played a role in SR but the prosecution hushed it up and refused to allow any of this evidence to be presented by the defense. Glorious. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:48:16
Lol, I really don't think he looks nervous. Actually, I was surprised his voice wasn't deeper. For some reason in my mind I had Gavin pictured as a hulk. That being said, I don't think he's nervous at all - but perhaps a little exuberant for the camera. It's not every day that you get interviewed after having just met who you think is satoshi.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:28:23
I would like to add that the judge was VERY biased. Ross hardly got a chance to defend himself. The judge basically tied the defense's hands behind their back. They were not allowed to bring in any of their own witnesses. They were not allowed to use any of their evidence. It was NOT a fair or impartial trial AT ALL and if you think it was then you are deluding yourself.
@_date: 2016-05-11 02:18:04
For a long time he was paid nothing. Also, his "desire for power" is clearly a false statement. What a truly laughable concept. The guy is nicer than a fucking teddy bear. I can't believe people take this drivel seriously.
@_date: 2016-05-07 14:21:10
The smear campaign against Gavin is getting pathetic. If you're gonna shill, at-least have some class. Jesus christ. It cannot be any more obvious how pathetic this fear-mongering witch hunt has become.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:26:57
The problem is that people are so quick to believe the murder for hire accusations. There is a very good chance that NONE of them are true. Remember they never actually charged him with any of the murder for hire charges. That in itself is very telling. The government lies all the time, why would they not lie about this just to make him look bad?

Hundreds of thousands of people in Murica are arrested every year for possession of pot. We are getting more lenient but the jails are still full of weed offenders. God Bless America.
