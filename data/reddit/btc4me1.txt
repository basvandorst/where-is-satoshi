Thanks man. I was most scared about BTC-e... they fucking rock i hate the negativity that r/bitcoin gives them... They got back to my ticket within 10 mintues and told me a way to reset it. Granted I will not be able to log into my account for 2 weeks, but this is much better than never being able to log in.. appreciate the tip too!

On my Google account or on my exchange account? I cannot log into the exchanges right now? Can you point me in the direction of how to do this? Any help would be immensely appreciated. Thank you so much

Hey there. Sorry it took so long for this response.
I did not enable google 2FA online for my gmail account (accounts.google.com) until last night when all of this happened.
Previously, I had been accessing btce and mintpal using the android app. 
I downloaded the android app, went onto btce, made a new code, scanned it in with the android app, and that was all i had to do. 
I guess I assumed that it would be online sine authy, which is what i use for coinbase, just uses your phone number (so you can change phones / restore os etc you just need the same phone number) to get access to the account.
I have been browsing google 2FA site for a hour or two now and cant find any mention of any of the sites I had used 2FA for. Any help?

Yeah. I'm pretty sure the whole rise from $10 to $1200 was market manipulation from Gox though (the willy report).. Who knows what the actual price would be without it presently.

I didnt reven realize that you can keep offline backups of 2FA QR codes.
I assumed that the Google Auth app worked based on your phone number, much like Authy for coinbase does. I was stunned to say the least when I redownloaded the google auth app and none of the codes were there.
I just logged on to my google account.. I did not have 2FA enabled on my gmail account before so I had to enable it... None of the codes to the exchanges were there. I was using solely the android app to auth it..
I have submitted tickets to both mintpal and btce.. pretty much unless they respond im fucked right?
