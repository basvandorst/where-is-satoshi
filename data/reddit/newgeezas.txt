It's not just semantics because it's possible to create a fork with much less work yet have way more blocks (i.e. longer chain)

I'm not sure what your reply means.
1 uBTC = 1 bit
@_date: 2018-05-03 01:23:36
1 mBTC = 1kbit
Not too difficult me thinks

My 11-years-old account got stolen a few days ago. Not sure how, but I haven't changed my password since I created it, and it was a weak password in today's standards - 8 characters only - and I reused that password in the past, so my guess is that password got hacked and linked to my old account's username. Oh well...

Both are correct. You're not realizing that there are two ways to express a difference between two numbers as a percentage - both are inverses of each other. 1 is an 80% reduction of 5. 5 is a 500% increase of 1. Example. I bought a five-years-old car in 2000 for 10k and sold it in 2010 for 2k. My car lost 80% of its value, OR, said another way, for 10k I could buy 5 times more (500%) fifteen-years-old cars than five-years-old cars.

That would defeat one nice benefit of LN, increased privacy (and efficiency to some extent).
If there's a need for such audit trail, it can always be built to be opt-in as an addition to LN instead of being forced on everyone.

If I pay in bitcoin, 5 mBTC is 5 mBTC. If I sell my bitcoins to buy dollars, I pay 1% extra or more to buy dollars, then have to figure out how to get a credit card, for the same 5 mBTC thing.

Only the ones connected to the node that went down, but not necessarily and not right away. As long as the node that went down does not ask to close those channels or does not try to close it unilaterally, possibly trying to cheat and close with more money than they should, then the other nodes that have these channels with it can keep them for some time in the hope that the node comes back online later and makes the channel usable again. If the node never comes back, then ovet time nodes will start closing their channels with that node (unilaterally) with a time-lock.

Did you do the write up of the BIP? I just wanted to give props; it's very well written - clear, succinct, and explains the reasoning for the choices well. Definitely feels like "Wuille quality" material based on my recollection of your Bech32 presentation and how thoroughly you have covered that design space to reach the final design.

I think this will not be possible with your existing dust, but should be possible for your "schnorr dust".

The only reason you'd be entering the seed words is if you explicitly choose the option to reset your device and then to recover it with existing seed. The website should never tell you to do it.
Edit: to clarify, if you're getting an update, then yes, the device will be reset and you'll need to re-enter the seed. Note that in your case since you didn't hold any coins, it's better to just use the newly generated seed instead of re-entering the old one. Finally and most importantly, I highly recommend you always use advanced recovery when entering the seed - this way you can do it on a compromised computer and still be fine.
Oh, and one last thing - don't worry about your trezor itself - there's practically no chance the device itself gets hacked remotely.

Big feature that's still missing is AMP - sending larger payments via multiple paths of smaller amounts. This functionality would greatly increase average routable capacity.
