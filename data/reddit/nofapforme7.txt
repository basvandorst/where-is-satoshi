He calls himself a professor as a high school teacher?

They think drops scare us, only makes me want to buy more lol

Umm looks the same to me.  If you only mean the new design from the old one then it's been a while since you went on Paypal.  That changed a long time ago.
@_date: 2014-10-27 00:19:33
Yep.  But it's a small country, can't really compare it to America so better to use urban areas.

Don't worry, as long as you don't need the money immediately.  I firmly believe it will be around 10k in 3 years.
@_date: 2014-10-25 09:36:29
Because of the exchange rate or just because they cost more there?

I've heard many stories like this, often customers will fall in love with the girls and not understand that they can't be "saved".  
@_date: 2014-10-25 18:21:07
Hmm well it was kinda recent, but it's been like that for a while now, dunno how long exactly.  I use it all the time so I'm already used to it.

Mine has been verifying for a day now.  I use coinbase but sick of these fees every time i buy and sell.  Circle has no fees right?  A bit higher prices on the coins, but still ends up costing less than coinbase if there are no fees.

Israel actually has the most tech startups per capita of anywhere in the world next to silicon valley. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 09:52:37
Why would you think it's fiction?  Do you have any idea how many women are trafficked?  Millions.  I lived in Israel and there are a ton of them there.  The Russian mafia lures half of them there promising them normal jobs, then steals their passports and tells them their family is dead if they don't cooperate.  The other half are just plain kidnapped or forced into it for family debts.  Their customers often try to "save" them like she mentioned, and I remember one famous case of a guy who burned down a brothel to try and save a girl he fell in love with.  There is a very good chance this is real.

Wonder what he's doing now.  Was he a permanent resident of Japan?  If his visa was tied to MtGox then they should deport his fat ass.  
@_date: 2014-10-25 09:23:08
Just checked circle, 3 dollars more on there.

It's not profitable anymore unless you have tons of capital to spend on crazy hardware.  All the big companies mine most of the coins now and it's impossible to compete with their hardware.  Most people I knew that had great mining rigs and used to make a lot ended up mining barely anything in the end and selling their rigs.

I speak Hebrew so it doesn't bother me.  :P I'm used to watching foreign films anyway.

I like how their website title says "mcxNOW - The digital exchange for smart people"
@_date: 2014-10-25 18:59:04
He moved to Japan in 2009, no way he has gotten permanent residency there already unless he married a Japanese girl.  I also see that he was convicted of fraud in France and if he returns there he has to serve a jail sentence.

Do you enjoy making up statistics that are nowhere close to accurate?  
I don't even care how fast it rises.  I have a set amount that I hold, and another that I day trade with volatility.  Every time the price goes down, I make money off it by buying cheap and selling high.  
I do believe in bitcoin, I use it for purchases, and I am not here for a get rich quick.  It's the future, and I am not a miner.
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:57:47


You're forgetting that other wallets buy from exchanges.  For instance, coinbase buys on bitstamp, etc.  They place huge orders when they need coins.

You'd be surprised how well Russian sex slaves speak/write English.  They are forced to master it because most of their "clients" are international travelers.
@_date: 2014-10-26 18:24:48
Only if the exchange you buy it from is located in your state.
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:47:45
I love it when the price goes down, I buy more.
@_date: 2014-10-25 18:22:00
Well fuck MtGox either way.  That guy was a moron.
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:30:45
Some people have nothing better to do, I guess.
@_date: 2014-10-27 09:59:08
You were hoping for a get rich quick scheme and it ruined your life because it didn't deliver within a year?  Bitcoin will be at 10k in three years.  Have patience.  Nobody reasonable thought it would be at 10k by now.  Volatility is expected in anything new like this.

We're still in wave 2, it will reverse soon.  It might reverse now, or wave 2 could end around 330 or maybe even 300.  But after the wave is over it will pass 400 again.  I'm buying now.

They aren't kept locked up 24/7, they are allowed to roam the city and I believe they live separately from their handlers.  The mafia knows they won't run because if they do their family is fucked.

I think the price was only at 150 for a heartbeat because of a sale or two....I was watching the ticker the whole day and never noticed 150.

Maybe in Texas, but recording ANYONE in Massachusetts without their consent is illegal.

Whattt?  Their insurance covers drops too?  
@_date: 2014-10-25 09:21:37
Oh haha.  Well it's pretty easy for me on Coinbase too.
