Nah. As a German, I'm slow at figuring out British humour but he really made me laugh by mentioning the 'huge UK car manufacturing sector'.

Calling it 'straight up speculation' is the easiest way to escape the difficulties of understanding bitcoin's qualities.

Furthermore, the employees spend most of their salary on products, services etc., hence btc flows back to companies.

Do you know of any issues with Samourai? I'm hesitating to use it because it's said to be a non-released app in the Google app store. Does that mean it's beta and buggy?

Each of them is divisible into 100.000.000 satoshis. As the value of each bitcoin increases, the pay roll will reflect smaller and smaller amounts.

Could someone explain how to handle the different address formats? I could offer my clients to pay me with non-segwit, segwit P2SH and beech32 but I don't know what works for them and I don't want to confuse them. Is there a risk of them sending btc to a wrong address format and the btc being irrecoverable?

If it's a new wallet, does that mean that the 24-word seed I wrote down when creating my legacy wallet is now useless and I need to note a new 24 word seed? My ledger nano didn't mention anything like this when I did the transfer to segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:33:15
ok, thanks again! I wrote ledger support an email just now, just to make sure.

If customers urge wallets and exchanges hard enough to implement it, they will all do so.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:31:26
Because of context. quickfluid pointed out that the UK media are particularly dramatic in describing bitcoin as pure evil and I said that this is likely due to the fact that the British economy is dominated by the financial sector. Of course there are other important sectors as well but it doesn't change the fact that the financial sector is particularly strong in the UK.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:48:06
What do you mean "it's not retro-compatible with the normal addresses"? You can surely send coin back and forth between legacy and segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:25:00
Use SegWit, support Lightning Network implementation.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:50:34
ok, thanks for explaining, this has been worrying me for a while. Also I'm worried if the seed I wrote down for my ledger nano s legacy wallet became useless now that I migrated to a segwit wallet on the same device. Ledger never mentioned anything like needing to write down a new 24-word seed. But obviously since segwit uses a new wallet, it must have a new seed. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:07:53
UK doesn't have much industry besides the banking sector. Naturally they are scared of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:50:29
You pick a wallet that supports segwit addresses:  
More and more wallet providers are integrating segwit. You can help by urging them to prioritise segwit integration. Segwit considerably reduces fees. Currently, Lightning is being implemented on top of Segwit. Lightning should go mainstream in the course of 2018. Then, transactions will be instant and basically for free.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:40:30
Sure, many people tend to hodl until they think the price is finally somewhere near bitcoin's true value. Do you think that's a problem? I'm not sure that we need to be worried about this kind of deflation. It won't cause a depression. Bitcoin deflation means fiat inflation. People are dropping their fiat currency into the market because they prefer bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 07:19:01
Thanks! Good to know.
@_date: 2017-02-19 10:06:46
I'm even more confused now. The documentary shows people paying small amounts at the queue at their hairdresser, in restaurants at the dentist, anywhere.  and  they say "any amount, instantly, basically for free". 
But every time I make a transaction, it takes minutes for confirmations to come in. People complain that they wait 10 minutes, hours, or even days for a transaction to be confirmed. Even when you spend the suggested fee it takes minutes. People here at r/bitcoin say that Bitcoin was never meant to be used for small, everyday purchases. Solutions are apparently in the pipeline. So then how do all the people in this documentary do it already?
And how am I supposed to explain this to friends who never heard of Bitcoin? So many times I've been tempted to tell them "Just pull out your phone, download a wallet app, and watch me send you 1 mBTC instantly and basically for free!" But what if we then wait minutes or hours for a confirmation?
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:24:41
Thank you! Very helpful. They should have taken a moment in this one hour documentary to explain this the way you just did.
@_date: 2017-02-19 13:22:40
So the payment is received in seconds but the first confirmation comes minutes or hours later (depending on the sender giving an appropriate fee). Do I need to enable a "zero conf instant tx setting" somewhere in the app I use, or is it supposed to work this way by standard?
I realise that my comments here probably sound really stupid to most of you, but I really think these issues will come up if I show my friends how to do a bitcoin transaction. Thanks for your answers!
@_date: 2017-02-19 12:47:37
Okay, thanks, so do you think that all these scenes in the documentary are staged? They show plenty of small transfers being sent and received within seconds, at the hairdresser, restaurant, anywhere, without anyone ever mentioning the need to think of a fee. How do they do it? Are these scenes fake? 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:57:36
How long might that uncertain period be? 
I have some bitcoins in an Armory wallet and very small amounts on an exchange and in a mobile wallet. I don't want my coins to be stuck one day on an old, useless chain while another chain has become the standard. Should I rather sell now and think about reinvesting later?
I wish there was an ELI5 and a step-by-step guide by a trustworthy authority. In this subreddit, many comments are so cynical that I don't know what to believe any more.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:26:45
Thanks! So I'll try to find out if Armory would support either outcome, and if yes I'll keep all my coins. Such uncertain times... This must be the reason for the recent price drop.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:06:18
Is Handelsblatt correct? Will the bitcoins I currently hold become worthless? I was told that I just need to wait a few days after a chain split and then could use my old coin on whichever chain prevails. So there is no risk of my current bitcoins becoming "more or less worthless". Which version is true?
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:04:12
Let's focus on the bit for now, aka 1 µBTC. One satoshi is too small currently to be a useful unit.

I just wrote an email to the author Frank Wiebe, linked to this thread, and asked him to correct his mistake. 
At least he'll be more sensible in the future - I hope.

It takes several minutes now for transactions to be processed, because blocks are always full. So much longer than visa or cash payments. Is there any solution to this "transaction jam" other than SegWit + Lightning?

Why is that CEO acting so confused?! Like they just woke him up out of bed. Completely unprepared. Fox doesn't want the public to understand bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:29:23
So then bitcoin was never meant to be used for everyday small purchases? I'm getting even more confused now. I had the impression that transactions were supposed to be confirmed nearly instantly, or at least so quickly that bitcoin could compete with credit cards, and that this slowed down recently.

Moreover, it's misleading to manipulate the candlestick width on each chart so as to fit an intended narrative. The Bitcoin market never opens or closes. Candles look sophisticated but make no sense.
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:27:34
The bitcoin protocol defines the inflation rate to eventually drop to zero. The inflation slows down with each halving. However, I wouldn't call that alone "deflation".
What makes it deflationary is the inevitability of some bitcoins getting inaccessible forever when people loose their private keys or die without passing their keys on to their heirs. As a result, the total amount of accessible bitcoins will definitely be decreasing. 
I guess that's what's meant with "mathematically deflationary".

There are multiple exchanges and each has its own BTC/USD price. The point of an average, weighted by volume of each exchange, is to have a single point of reference.

My bandwidth is neither limited nor throttled but my internet provider may terminate the contract in case of "excessive use" (they are entitled to do that, German contract).
So I really only want to run a full node around the time of the fork if it makes any sense. If 2x nodes can simply hide from core auto disconnect, it does NOT seem to make any sense.

I got that but as you see in the screenshot I posted, my router is requiring me to select among http, ftp, emule, TCP... I randomly tried some settings but nothing worked so far.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:16:01
Thanks, it works now since I selected TCP in the settings for port 8333. But now I read that running a full node on Windows 10 is useless because 2x is hiding their nodes from the core auto disconnect and running a script to detect 2x nodes is too complicated :-(
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:00:57
I've been following that guide but it doesn't explain well how to open port 8333:  
My router is asking me for these settings:  Can someone help me?
FRITZ!Box is a common router in Germany. I'm probably not the only one who cannot figure out how to set up their full node. Would be great if bitcoin.org could improve their guide.
Edit: To open port 8333, people using a **FRITZ!Box** router need to select "Other Application" and **TCP**.
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:40:28
That cannot be right. Price was not 2,500 $ in 2013.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:27:56
You're making BTC look way more expensive than it is currently.
It is finally time to think in terms of bits and satoshis, as it was originally intended: 45 sats = 0.45 bit = 1 INR. Now that sounds much more affordable.

I have a problem with opening port 8333. My router is asking me for settings like kinds of protocols and servers:  How should I set it?
FRITZ!Box is a very common router in Germany. I would guess that many people are not setting up a full node because there's no proper guide.

I have a ledger nano s. I haven't yet migrated to segwit since the recent UASF. Should I do that now or rather wait until the 2x hardfork? I want to make sure I have access to the 2x coins so I can dump them for real BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:39:28
:-) I could never figure out all the technical details but I do know that bitcoin is nothing less than the multitude's mean of world wide emancipation. And its developers are heroes. Everybody should do what they can to support this revolution against the 1%'s attempts of stalling it.
I just hope my full node really does help. I'm not on Linux but on Win10. It seems that 2x nodes can hide from core auto disconnect on Win10. Someone said my core node will block them anyways but someone else said one needs to install a linux script on windows. Now that's a bit too much for me.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:49:06
I'm trying to open port 8333 and my router is asking me these settings:  Can someone tell me what to fill in?
FRITZ!Box is a common German router. More full nodes would be up if the how-to guide at bitcoin.org explained the settings better.
Edit: To open port 8333, people using a **FRITZ!Box** router need to select "Other Application" and TCP.

Hi Pamela, I get confused at minute 8 where you say "Backing up your wallet = making a copy of your private key". 
I thought that whenever some of a private key’s bitcoins are spent, then that private key is being completely depleted of its bitcoins and the leftover change is sent to a newly generated private key. So how on earth is a backup of an empty private key supposed to be any good!?!
And what exactly am I supposed to back up? Seed, private key or wallet.dat? Won't all these backups be useless once a tx is made and new private key is generated? 
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:12:26
All clear. Thanks for explaining so well!
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:22:58
Thank you for explaining in such detail! So if I understand right, then 12 mnemonic words are enough for software and hardware wallets that support BIP39 to create an infinite number of private keys. And any other such hardware/software can re-create the used keys from this mnemonic and continue from there with creating further private keys unique to this mnemonic. This blows my mind, the people who created this are genius! 
I'll be sure to also have my own passphrase as recommended by you. 12 words just seem so easy to guess. If somebody created a software that randomly guessed sets of 12 words, wouldn't they sooner or later "find" somebody's actual private keys?! 
I've been having a wallet on Armory for a while but my Armory has stalled downloading the blockchain half a year ago, not getting support, and moreover I don't know how Armory's going to handle the August 1 fork, so I want to migrate somewhere else. That's why I'm trying to figure out the details. Would be a pitty if I just copied one useless old private key, lol. I hope I can just import the wallet.dat to some other, simpler software. Will figure this out soon I hope, I have ordered a ledger but it probably won't arrive before the fork.
Thanks again!

Thanks, my mistake. First time I read about "notional". Not sure what it's supposed to mean in this context, but the chart sure looks fantastic anyways :-)
@_date: 2018-12-31 09:46:25
-83% is deep read while +83% is still yellow. The chart therefore leaves me with the wrong impression that Bitcoin was overall doing badly during that period.
 Wouldn't it look greener and be more honest if the colors were to scale? You could make the scale itself stand out more and even extend to the deep reds, which would not appear in the diagram itself, to make it clear at first sight how well Bitcoin did overall. I wonder what that would look like.
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:08:41
It says "National USD value..." in the chart. Does that mean that the chart only reflects transactions "within the USA" or "in USD"? (Would that even be possible?)
