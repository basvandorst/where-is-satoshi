what you’re describing is a less efficient version of Blockchain snapshots. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:33:04
Everybody update! If you’re not running Bitcoin Core 0.16, you’re not keeping up with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:23:47
You don’t seem to get it. LN is not going to be a centralized solution like AWS. Can’t throw hardware at the problem and keep decentralized. Engineering is the answer. Not name calling and centralization! 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:08:01
Agreed.  This guy seems to want r/bitcoin to become a place to spread FUD about BTC and LN.  There's plenty of OTHER forums online if your goal is to spread FUD about BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:44:41
This place is dope! Are they accepting Lightning yet? I've got my node all set up and looking for places to spend!
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:45:22
Whenever I have any concerns about BTC all I need to do is hear this man speak and I buy more! This guy knows his shit and with advocates like this you know BTC is going up!
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:13:26
Just stop the FUD if we’re on the same side...
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:00:25
You’re so wrong. Check out the core devs work here.  Really got to Educate yourself. A lot more progress than you seem to be aware of
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:05:14
Well I’m upset. We need a strong fee market for Bitcoin to function properly. We had one in December with average fees as high as $55 a tx. Now we have excess space and a ton of bcashers bloating our Blockchain with spam transactions. 
We need to take up Luke Jrs proposals to cut out malicious spam in the short term and to slowly phase up the block size as legitimate transactions grow and technology improves. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:51:20
You should go back and read the LN white paper if you're going to spend time in this sub.  This community is about decentralization, not easy answers.  We're done here.
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:03:25
Dude. Everybody using segwit instead of traditional bitcoin transactions is a huge network alleviation tool! Segwit transactions are like 1/4 the size of old transactions.
And Replace by Fee let’s people pull back their transactions when they don’t put enough fee on them. This stops miners from gouging us to exploit their power. Bitcoin Core 0.16 is where it’s at and your opposition to it makes me question your motives...
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:18:24
Honestly I love that the tech is going to get me a lambo. We have the best Devs in the world on the Bitcoin Core team and they’ll keep this train rolling just like it has been. 
I have an 8 year horizon. And if you look at where BTC was 8 years ago compared to where it is now, the return on my investment is going to be huge! I don’t see how this isn’t obvious to more people. All you’ve gotta do is HODL and Lambo!
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:44:31
Yea but what incentive would somebody have to do the PoW for you? Are we going to compensate them in some way for securing the Lightning Network?
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:28:07
Somebody needs to make an OpenStreetMap for Lightning! I got all set up and want to spend my lightning BTC with ZERO fees!
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:13:09
You can disable the wallet functionality in bitcoin.conf. The point is Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation that defines the Bitcoin protocol. If you’re not running Bitcoin Core, you’re not running Bitcoin. And as for bugs, that’s why you better stay current with all the great new stuff our kickass Bitcoin Core devs are bringing to the world. Upgrade or get left behind. Bitcoin waits for no man!
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:49:19
RBF by default bro?! 0-conf is shit and RBF fixes that, especially for as BTC grows and we’ll have better transaction fees to secure our Blockchain RBF by default is needed so Bitmain doesn’t pull their usual bullshit. We need people running Bitcoin Core 0.16 and if you’re not upgrading you should or else YOU’RE just helping Bcash! Now remove the Bcash shit from your comment
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:07:52
No. If you needed a “beefy setup” to run LN then it would just be Bcash with extra steps. LN is about decentralization.  The easy way out is to just throw extra hardware at the problem but that’s not a long term solution. We need to continue to engineer solutions with our devs. Schnorr signatures, MAST.  Things like Segwit that reduce transaction size by about 75%. Those are the solutions. Not a Bcash like simplistic bigger hardware solution. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:04:14
Those Bcash fudsters will be all over this since they can’t get over how shitty their centralized coin is. satoshis vision my ass. 
we need to limit the number of connections a node can have so that they can’t spread their centralized hub FUD about LN. LN is the future!
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:42:38
? We need the network up to date. Older versions don’t even include segwit!  The network needsvalidating segwit nodes!
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:18:41
Stop with the FUD! You’ve already got your altcoins if that’s the way you feel. Leave rbitcoin alone. LN is going to be unstoppable and none of your points will change that. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:20:50
LN will run on raspberry pi’s. That’s the point. That’s true decentralization. Everybody runs at least one node. No server hardware required like with your centralized shitcoin bcash. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:13:50
Read my lips. BTC isn’t just for the rich. It needs to run on a raspberry pi for real decentralization. Amazon doesn’t run MY coin. 
In fact, we should be moving towards running all our nodes on our cheap android phones. If you need to have a commercial level server to transact you’re not decentralized. You should really educate yourself. read some of Luke jr’s proposals and maybe you’ll begin to understand
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:45:47
That’s great news!! So glad they fixed that! 
I thought you needed to run a full node or trust somebody else to monitor the network for somebody stealing your funds. If we don’t need to run a full node or trust a 3rd party to use LN Bcash is as good as dead! Fuck those BCHes
Edit: can you make a PSA post about this. Everybody keeps saying you need to run an always on node or trust a 3rd party with your unencrypted private keys to use LN. the FUD is real...
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:16:42
No hardforks! Hardforks are for Bcash and their centralized shit coin. Not BTC
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:56:47
Wait so if i don’t want to pay a bunch of money to open a bunch of channels I can still open just a couple channels to well connected/funded hubs that will then send my transaction in my behalf right? Cuz that’s a super cool feature of LN! That’s the Bcash killer. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:30:23
I love this.  Those Bitcoin Cash/Shitcoin Cash trolls are basically obsolete now.  Batching to the rescue!  Honestly, with spam levels where they are we should be looking harder at Luke Jr's really interesting block size proposal.  Spam is crushing the decentralization of our network!
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:26:09
I can't wait for them to add the ability to receive funds on eclair! That will be the bcash killer!
@_date: 2018-03-19 05:36:44
Wait, I thought with LN you could bounce a payment off a hub so you didn't have to open a channel with each person you transacted with? I thought that was a cool feature. Hope it wasn't dropped in the latest versions.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:33:28
Well if that's true what's to stop my "shitty" node from being ddos'd.  The internet works because I don't get ddos'd.  LN will work because I won't get ddos'd.  It's onion routed so nobody knows who I am and it's anonymous.  My point is your wrong because LN WILL be decentralized and if it could be ddos'd it would end up centralized. And it won't end up centralized because we have some of the best devs in the world working on this and they're going to keep finding solutions for all the FUD bcashers throw at us.
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:54:24
Don’t use btcd. It’s not guaranteed to be bug compliant with the Bitcoin Core protocol. If you want to run bitcoin you’ve got to run bitcoin core or else you might end up following an altcoin like the Bitcoin Classic/Bitcoin XT/Bitcoin Unlimited/Bitcoin ABC/BTC1 Guys all did. Bitcoin Core is where it’s at!
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:34:40
And a block has no guarantee of not being orphaned. The finality of a transaction isn’t black and white at any point.
