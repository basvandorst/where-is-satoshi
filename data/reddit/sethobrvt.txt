I used Mt. Gox twice back in 2011 when I first got into Bitcoin.  Haven't even thought of using them since due to their incompetence.  The sooner they are gone for good the better.  At this point all they do is give Bitcoin a bad image in the news.

This virus actually encrypts your data so simply removing the virus won't do you any good - the only way to get the key to decrypt is by paying the ransom fee - although they are obviously criminals so there is no guarantee they will give you the key even if you do pay.  ALWAYS keep backups!  Especially for a business!

Yep.  Seems like they got away with it.  Haven't heard anything about them in a long time.  I lost 1 BTC to their scam :-(

People never learn....RealSolid has put customers of the exchange in this same situation about 11 months ago.  I left the exchange then and never looked back...

I can't believe that 1 year ago I paid 1.2BTC each for block erupters!

There are services like coinbase.com and circle.com that allow you to link a bank account and buy/sell bitcoin.  You can use Localbitcoins.com if you want to find someone in your area willing to buy them for cash.

It is fine to leave Bitcoins for daily purchases/use on Coinbase wallet - but you should never leave large amounts of BTC under anyone else's control to reduce the risk of loss or theft.  If you are leaving coins on there make sure you at least use a very strong password and two-factor authentication.

Ummm...BTC wasn't around in 2007!

Looks like 62 people already did :-( 62 of these sold already!

Looking at my old mining wallet and seeing several .1BTC payouts per day from 2011 makes me sad that I spent most of the coins at the time!

Every hard fork will be contentious for a a small group (in this case for the moderators of this subreddit, and for the Core developers). Hard forks are a way to evolve a cryptocurrency faster. They're extremely necessary. SegWit2X will simply proof this one more time to some of the people that have taken to seriously some of the posts allowed here, while not seeing what has been removed for years.

The third group of that IP address in the video is in the 600s....lol...why can't people reporting on technology know what they are talking about!

I was going to make a MtGox joke in the title but I figured I would let others fight to be the first to make it

Looks great!  Nice clean interface.  Good Job :-)
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:50:25
wow...they even photoshopped the BFL box!  Notice the blurred tops of the miners where they "removed" the BFL logo as well!  They forgot to hide the BFL logo that can be seen through the vents on the unit on the right though!  
REPORT THIS GUYS POSTS SO NO ONE FALLS FOR HIS HORRIBLE SCAM ATTEMPT!
@_date: 2013-10-23 03:13:55
Filled it out!  Best of luck with your report :-)

Innovative Mining Solutions is a complete scam and has been discovered by people at bitcointalk.org.  DO NOT BUY FROM THEM AS YOU WILL GET RIPPED OFF!
