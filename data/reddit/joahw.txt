Why do both exist if they are owned by the same people and serve mostly the same purpose?

The graph you posted seems to prove OPs point. Using his optimistic scenario comes in at ~94% of the 10 mins/block scenario. That comes out to ~9.4 minutes / block on average. Your graph clearly shows the average block time as being under the 10 minute mark.

Don't you just hate it when you forget to switch accounts?

TBH that's a lot better than the "knockoff scientologist" look espoused by many around here.

But that requires me to actually understand the technobabble I'm spouting and not just regurgitate what someone else told me!

You joke, but the frequency at which I see shit like "believe in the tech" on here makes me think I've stumbled onto a Scientologist den or something. It's just a decentralized immutable ledger. It's not magic. It's not a fiat duping hack.

Ah thanks for the explanation. The way I understand it, a majority attack is theoretically possible, but there's not a lot of upside to it other than potentially scamming a few merchants with double spends. Considering the massive sunk cost on mining hardware and the upside of being a 'well-behaved' node (tx fees, block rewards), it simply doesn't seem like it would be worth it to orchestrate such a massive conspiracy. Also, I don't think even the Chinese government has the kind of power to force the miners into doing something like that.

Unless SHA is cracked by quantum computers. Then the immutable ledger is just a ledger.

How does this work? What mechanism would ban them from the network? How would such a mechanism not be abusable in other situations?
