The fact that it's more volatile than other currencies is irrelevant.  If someone chooses to use it instead of the dominant currency, they're taking on the volatility risk.  It *is* volatile, just like every single other currency in the world is.  Now, I appreciate that it's much more volatile than others, but that's not was op asked about.

This has been going on a long time.  I made a post about it a while ago.  I use a different email address for every account I create, and the one I used at btc-e has been sent about a dozen scam attempts.  Additionally, the credentials I used to create my account at btc-e have been used in attempts to log into other bitcoin related sites
Either the operators of BTC-e are actively scamming, of they've been badly compromised.

If someone hasn't said this, it's really no different than using any other currency in a place which is dominated by another currency.  When I travel abroad, I often will regret changing $1000 one day only to watch the exchange rate change the other day.  Also, regardless if the shop takes USD or not (Walmart, in Mexico, will do it on the spot and the push of a button), if you return something, you're getting local currency back.

Maybe.  I got that from 'nmap -O', so it's tough to say.  It does uses a number of metrics to guess that, but how accurate it is I don't know exactly.

No devaluation here.  Only shifting value, and to those whose efforts continue to make the value what it is.  You can maintain a small mine and cover your holding cost as well as help the community.  If you don't want to, you don't have to.

Thank you.  I deal with trolls a lot.
12% a year is outrageous. I agree.  I'm not suggesting penalizing savings.  It just made the math easy.  Pick a grace period...500 years if you want, and then how quickly you want it to decay.  It'll be a bit balancing act so that when the grace period kicks in that outrageous sums of money don't start becoming available again.  Something someone with much more economic theory background than I have should be doing.
Also look at it this way: Imagine in the future, when there's only a single bitcoin left, and it's divided to 10^-20th across the world.  With all the protocol changes, there's no way to re-encrypt lost coins.  At some point, cracking lost private keys will be feasable by either a large government, corporation, university, etc.  If you want to see destabilization, wait until a lost key worth 1000BTC (hell, even 5) is cracked when the value is $1 for 1e-20.
Maybe we should start metering that out sooner rather than later.  Just saying.
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:27:14
I agree with everything you're saying.  It's an eventual problem though, and subdividing only solves it to a certain extent.
Especially back when btc were worth cents, how many crashed hard drives with tens of thousands of coins on them are out there?  While lost coins help current users in terms of value, it certainly doesn't do any good for bitcoin at large.
I'll say it again that holding coins costs users and miners real money in terms of storage and processing, but penalizing users for spending them (transaction fees) but not holding them will only impede getting them into circulation.
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:01:58
The problem is in longevity.  There will eventually be zero.  That may be hundreds or thousands of years in the future, but it's an inevitability.
I'm not saying any of those numbers have to be what the eventual mechanism is.  If there were a good way to prove certain coins were lost and just let the community recover them, that would be better, but there's not a good one.
You would pay a tax on that cash under your bed in the form of inflation.  It will lose purchasing power over time.
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:32:59
It is, agreed, but you have every opportunity to recover that.
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:40:11
I wasn't concerned with implementation, but your question got me thinking and this is what I can come up with.  You work it out in the protocol, and I'm again, talking less about coins that will be spent, but more importantly, coins that will never be spent.
1) Every miner calculates what this amount would be for each based on all the old balances in the block chain.
2) When a block is found, this sum is verified by the network (yes, this causes some timing problems).
3) When someone goes to spend coins, they can only spend the balance minus X percent.  It goes in the ledger with Y coins to recipient, Z in transactions, and X to nobody in particular since the tax has already been collected and distributed.  The network enforces the rule.
I'm most worried that, at some point, some very old wallet with what amounts to an outrageous sum gets cracked, and the whole system is upset by it.

Muskogee...wow.  Haven't been there in 20 years.  I'd make a trip for some bitcoin booze though.
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:18:14
You sir, get my point.  We're at an interesting point where adoption can be made to happen.  Holding coins costs miners and users real money in terms of storing and processing the block chain (admittedly it's trivial, but certainly non-zero).  To penalize people for spending them (transaction fees) and not holding them causes some interesting problems.
It was the paper by Adi Shamir (and that other guy) that got me thinking.  I forget his exactly conclusion, but it was a tiny percent that was actually in circulation.  The question that nobody to answer is how many of those are lost forever.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:55:18
Thanks for the thought provoking reply.  I'm not saying it's a good idea, but a mechanism that the community can recover lost coins.  That's all.  When I ran the math--i'm sorry, went and fucked myself--it seemed somewhat interesting.  And it's not a tax that any government would get, but the community at large, including you.

An ASCI, as said before, is an Application Specific Integrated Circuits.  All around you--in your dish washer, your microwave--there are integrated circuits.  Most of them are designed to be "general purpose".  I.e, have as many uses as possible.  ASIC's, on the other hand, perform something very specific, very well (usually, that means very quickly).  In modern networking hardware, for example, you'll find ASIC's that very quickly route packets to their destination because they are designed specifically for that purpose.
ASIC is a general term for a chip that is designed to do **something** very well, and normally very quickly.  For mining bitcoins, the purpose of the ASIC is the SHA256 cryptographic hash.  SHA256 ASIC's have existed for some years now, but not specifically optimized for bitcoin mining.  Could you get most ASIC's to do general computation?  In most cases yes, but it'd be a lot of work and you're probably better off using a more general purpose IC.
There's no such thing as a "regular ASIC" as all ASIC's are, by definition, very specific at what they do.  
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:04:49


In general, they are.  I understand that they can be subdivided, but there will eventually be zero.


I'm not suggesting that either. Just a mechanism to recover lost coins.


Not this either.
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:52:37
But changing the protocol to do this requires global coordination of billions of users, something that gets much harder, or even impossible over time.  And, these much divided coins increase transaction size significantly.
All I'm really getting at is that a mechanism that penalizes circulation, and costs miners real money in storage to hold should penalize holding as well.
