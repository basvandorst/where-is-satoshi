Wow, so that's what pure evil sounds like.

ALL prices are actually set by the hedonic cost of crime.

I may have been a bit underhanded with my terminology. I'm a supporter of the State of Nature. I believe and uphold Natural Law. Call it tyrannical if you wish, but the currently "successful" are about to get majorly divested by the broke majority.

"raw capitalism"? I don't think I get your meaning. Under any form of capitalism, property rights have to be systematically defined and enforced by a trusted authority, otherwise what you're describing is the "State of Nature", Bellum omnium contra omnes, aka "Anything goes", "Wild West Mentality". The difference is the trusted authority.

I'm sure he'd have been better off holding onto them until he or his exchange or one of his transactions got hacked and he lost everything.

Nope.

Would have been much better for them to be cut before the creation of bitcoin. USD price of bitcoin should be vanishingly high.

OK, so we put the bitcoin in a collective vault for increased security, then we do business with the people who own the vault whenever we need to do a transaction, right? But what if the people who own the vault start loaning out more money than is actually in the vault? As long as everyone's content to leave the majority of their money in the vault at any given time, there's no problem and the people who own the vault can make a profit, right? Putting any layer on top of bitcoin recreates fractional reserve banking all over again. Because people aren't really using access to a finite resource as currency anymore. NOT putting any layer on top of bitcoin immediately creates day-to-day security and usability problems, because crime eventually becomes cheaper than legitimate access to said resource. It's a catch-22 that can't be solved. If bitcoin had any chance of working to solve our problems, we'd never have left the gold standard to begin with. Collectivization of security just defers and concentrates the potential for crime, so you have bank vs bank or cartel vs cartel or nation vs nation crime, but the little guy gets fucked either way.
