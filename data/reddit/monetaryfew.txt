My best moment of 2015 is receiving and using my Xapo debit card. 
What I would like to see in 2016, something I didn't hear anybody mention before and do not know about the feasibility, is to be able to receive bitcoin from someone by providing a bank account number, for example IBAN/BIC details as we have in Europe. 
I like using bitcoin especially when the other party doesn't know or care about it. In 2016 I would like to receive bitcoin in the same way 2015 made it possible to spend bitcoin.

I do agree with you. Certainly... A credit card number is not exactly the same as a private key. More information is needed. But still, these things are easily retrievable. 
Have you ever heard of PCI compliance? You think this kind of measures make any sense in a bitcoin world?

I understand the concept of Counterparty, yes. But is there also a way to have a local currency, pegged to the national currency?
Having price stability. while using the blockchain to have transparency.
That's the most important part of having a succeeding local currency.

That's not the issue... I know that bitcoin cannot be banned. 
What scares me is that I can't imagine a central bank doesn't understand this too.
So it makes me think... Does the establishment actually WANT bitcoin to succeed? You know, NWO one world currency, etc.
But still... I don't really see why they would want that. It's not debt-based. 
So I guess it's just stupidity and not some elaborate plan as described in the link below.

Branching out to other subreddits is not necessary anymore. This part has been covered the last couple of days.
ChangeTip actually doesn't need to change strategy that much...
The only thing the team needs to keep in the back of their heads is that they could become the Twitter hashtag for money tipping.
Some have tried...
But this is the moment to actually have the network and do it!
Later on you can start thinking about paywalls and such for commercial partners.
But first build the network and be open about the future plans...

It makes me wonder now... You think any of these people in the picture actually know how to set up a bitcoin wallet or anything close to it? I would be very surprised if one of them was actually able to.

Hi Counterparty team,
Is it possible to create a local currency on your platform? I am thinking of something similar to the Bristol Pound (of course only digital in this case) and keep a 1 to 1 par with the national currency (in our case the euro)?
If so, what are the options available for users to pay with this local currency to each other? using a smartphone or tablet for example.

I don't get how this is not like a private key? As far as I know, if I have someone's credit card number, I can unlock the funds and order things online. Obviously, this comes with a risk and will not go unnoticed, but still... Please explain me why this is disingenuous...

Where do you get that BS from? 
Maybe if you would order 1 gram, yes, the sending cost would be high. In this case you can just go to a local coin store and buy it there. No way you will pay 10-30% more.
If you want to buy a couple of ounces, the sending cost will be a small percentage of the price of the gold you are buying.

Price discovery is always important... This certainly counts for Bitcoin. I certainly agree! Without price discovery, Bitcoin doesn't exist. Let that be clear. The only thing I am trying to say in this post is that when attending the launch of the first Bitcoin ATM in Portugal, the periphery of Europe, no one mentioned the price. Everybody is excited about the possibilities of p2p finance and fully believes that this is the way forward. To summarize, I think these kind of events are far more important than the current price and will be more important in defining the future than the discussion about the current price of Bitcoin. That's all... 
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:36:38
Thanks for the reply! 
Your point is addressing exactly what the current "problem" is with using the blockchain technology and keeping a 'par' with the established currency, in this case the euro. 
My question is how one can use the blockchain in keeping this 'par' and still take advantage of the blockchain security and transparency.
I'm sure it is possible.
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:17:52
Changetip statistics would be cool, certainly!
Being more transparent, yes!
Further down the road, ChangeTip probably could become THE killer app for sidechains...
But most importantly, ChangeTip should promise to never charge any extra fees on tips or transfers from or to the ChangeTip wallet. 
(Those fees belong to miners, let us not forget that!)
Now it is the time for ChangeTip to use the momentum and create a decent network. 
The network effect will make sure the platform stays alive in the future and will give different options to monetize this project appropriately. 
Use Reddit as an example... 
And all will be good.

Having worked for eBay, I know arbitration is a real problem. Reputation on the platform is almost of no relevance on eBay. If the customer says he didn't receive the item, and the seller can't prove it has, the buyer is most likely to win the dispute. Even if the seller has a great reputation...
Having a look at the way arbitration will work on OpenBazaar, I'm impressed. There is actually a market for agents operating in arbitration...

I'm really curious to know more about these kind of rules.
I only know a little about this, but as far as I understand, there is legislation on how and more importantly 'where from' a certain donation is coming from. 
Because if you are donating with bitcoin, there is kind of no maximum in donations or any other restrictions to donate to someone.
Anonymously if you would want to.
This kind of thickens the plot, no?

I agree. I don't understand why people keep on saying this security comes without a cost. The difference being that with credit cards you pay for the security of everone, with bitcoin you only pay when you fuck up yourself.
