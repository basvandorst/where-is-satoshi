You are somewhat condescending. I am a merchant and run a business and currently accept PayPal, Visa/Mastercard and bank deposit. If I can avoid fees entirely, then whatever crypto does that best for me is what I'll use. I am certain other business owners who don't care about whether Bitcoin lives or dies but are looking for more efficient transaction methods will go for a service with either no fees or the lowest fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:30:45
BTC has a place in the market but my thoughts exactly. Why pay fees when you don't have to pay them at all? You either get more profit if you decide to foot the bill or you get more customers as you'll be able to lower prices.

Books on bitcoin? Crypto moves so fast that by the time the book is written, published and sold it is obsolete.

Sorry I forgot I was in the wrong sub where we all just circle jerk. A grubby $10 is worth the same as a new $10 note. They are both worth $10. The cafe I go to offers a discount buying with crypto, BCH in particular because of fees so I'm using the tech that works for me now. Didn't say anything about the future and my point about ease of use with lightning still stands.   
Pretty pathetic that bringing constructive criticism to BTC or the notion that we need to make lightning easier to use so that everyone can use it leads to me getting down voted. Good job guys and gals. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:08:15
It is relevant to the comment, hence why I replied to the comment and not to OP. The comment said BTC had better developers however its hard to make a claim like that when there was a pretty big bug discovered. The irony is that it from was from a BCH user as well. I was simply stating both sides had pros and cons. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 08:51:48
Hey man, I'm vested in both sides and I'll just use what works. BCH is just cheaper now for that particular shop but when BTC is all set up then I'll gladly use that. I think its good that they are both developing different ideas and have different approaches because that just means more blockchain development and more ideas and we as the end users win. Some people really want things to be on chain and others don't but its not my place to tell people how they want their funds settled so they can pick whatever they want to use. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 02:57:31
I support both as they are different but have their own pros and cons. Having said that I bought some breakfast with BCH last week and it was super easy with negligable fees. Until lightning transactions become easier to facilitate, I can't see myself using it in the mean time. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 07:17:56
I really do wonder how many of these comments are from bots and fake accounts. I'm talking about ones where the bot doesn't screw up and make it blatantly obvious 
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:12:51
Exactly, but you still have the right. Not saying I agree but if you wanna believe the world if flat and want to share the idea and sell flat earth shirts then go ahead. You're allowed to have your own beliefs. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:31:14
Further proving r/bitcoin communities love for censorship. I have both coins but this is ridiculous. Now R/Bitcoin is telling people how to think. If Vitalik wants to think Eth is suddenly Bitcoin and wants to call it that then he has the right too. By the way Vitalik has expressed concern over the censorship here so let that sink in. Anyways in that sense Ver also has the right to call what he wants to think Bitcoin is Bitcoin. No one owns Bitcoin or the rights to Bitcoin so there is no copy right here being infringed. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:44:55
I get it, people will get hurt but that is inherent with free speech as well. Maybe I convince you the world is going to end in 2019 because I believe that and you sell everything you own this year. That's your fault for not doing your research. You can't sue people for selling fake healing crystals because they believe in that voodoo and you went along with it. I support both coins because they both have different use cases. Whether you want to admit it or not, both sides are fighting for what they believe is bitcoin. Both sides can call it what they want as no one actually owns the rights to the name "bitcoin". Just let the free market decide. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:49:38
Yeah so BCH isnt lead but what ever. The better analogy like I said is you buy a crystal and it doesnt heal you but it isnt lead and really has no effect other than waste your money because you did almost no research. Again, the BCH crowd has the right to believe that their chain is the real bitcoin as its closer to the original white paper and the BTC crowd has the right to believe that bitcoin needs to change so it is scalable. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:30:07
I always wonder what kind of people this actually works on. I figured if it did work it was always smaller increments and such or even like 1 or 2 eth. But a whole BTC? Thats some misplaced faith. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 12:34:51
Is this a joke? That's a slap on the wrist for what he got.

Underated comment
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:14:32
I always think about this. How does lost coins affect the value and how much are we willing to lose and keep using it? Logic dictates that we will continue to keep losing coins and as we approach something like 50-60%, is that amount of coins really viable for the whole world as money?
@_date: 2019-08-26 19:41:52
You can keep dividing each piece down but when there is higher demand for a declining supply, sustainability surely becomes an issue

You're telling me that everyone who was ever worth investing in didn't ever do dumb stuff as a teenager? Teenagers are for the most part still kids in my mind. Hell, your prefrontal cortex doesn't even finish properly developing till you're 25 on average which is why teenagers make so many wrong and impulsive decisions even when they know they shouldn't. I follow both coins and see an intrinsic value in both but the OP is obviously drinking the cool aid with echo chamber headphones on by resorting to ad hominem tactics.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:43:49
Its not like people can panic sell because of the unconfirmed tx. I don't think we've seen the worst of it yet.

@_date: 2017-11-13 22:06:37
Mining is already more or less centralized so what is the difference. How many home miners do you think are out there that really have enough hash power to really make a difference? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:50:27
Because BCH works exactly the same way the original BTC worked. Current BTC is just straight up unusable for any purpose until LN which is still in testing. Alot of influential people believe it is the real BTC which is why it will be BCH not eth or LTC.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:48:30
You have a right to disagree but it doesn't matter because this is science. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:31:57
A little out of context don't you think.. calling a teenager with fire works an explosive dealer. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:21:23
You even realise yourself that BTC core doesn't resemble the original BTC white paper. That makes BTC the fork/alt..
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:08:18
Im not disagreeing with you that it was stupid AF don't get me wrong. My issue is I've know many intelligent people who have made mistakes in their life and it's much easier to do when you are young. Better decision making and maturity comes with experience. 
If you want to slander, I'd just rather see people attacking his ideas if they have an issue instead of his character out of context for something he did over 15 years ago. Resorting to character assassinations and ad hominem arguments are weapons of people who have no real argument and just smells desperate to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:04:01
Looks like you are correct. I had thought he was younger when he committed that crime. No doubt what he was doing was dumb but still out of context.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:50:31
Yeah I believe he was selling illegal firecrackers or something of the matter. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:26:52
I own both but ended up increasing my position in BCH and picking up some more cheaper BTC as well. I thought BCH was a joke as my friends and I would just short it most of the time. The backlog of tx has turned me off a bit though because if these kind of things can happen then that really does reduce the value of BTC. The fact that I can't even move my BTC if I wanted to in a timely matter should be of concern. I don't think this time around will be a PnD because BTC has never lost hash power like this before which is what makes the network usable. If BCH drops back down to 300 again and it does dump then BCH is dead and over. Because of that, I dont think there is gonna be a dump unless they want to kill their own coin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:54:03
Well you are entitled to your opinion but it doesn't change mine. This is out of context and ad hominem and character assassinations look weak.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:47:05
Good idea but fees are gonna chew into a chunk of this.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:12:17
Considered moving my coins today, checked my tx fees and decided other wise. Network is unusable unless fees drop. Looking back now, no wonder core decided to start calling BTC a store of value instead of a payment system because its only worth anything if you dont ever plan on moving it. As of right now, BTC is a useless coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:22:34
Holy crap thats a long time haha. Hope its gets picked up soon. I was going to send what I had from my coinbase into my ledger but then I looked at the tx fee and figured it wouldnt get there for a while so I noped out of there. BTC will no doubt find a fix but Im sure they are also in a bit of a panic as to how they will prevent this from happening again. This is a minor set back for you but it is a major setback for adoption as slow transfers, huge back logs and high fees arent appealing to anyone and its going to be something people are going to point back to. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:17:41
18 more months of slow tx and high tx fees. I'm assuming business won't be using this for a good while then? There's a good chance BCH could set itself up as the more efficient payment solution in that time frame taking even more market share. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:53:07
Maybe you can just use some common sense before throwing around accusations. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 01:49:01
I'm not talking about the roof. I'm talking about transaction times and actual use case. People have sent funds yesterday that are still unconfirmed. My concern is that when people realise that it take it takes such a long time to confirm transactions and realise that they have to pay more (much more than other block chains) they will not see the value in using btc if it takes so long or costs so much. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 01:13:19
Wow, even when presented with evidence you'll just stick to your guns and say this issue is fake. What happened to open discussion? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:13:06
BTC has never lost it's hash power like this before. This is a first. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 01:51:24
The problem is people are not using LN because it is still too complicated to use for casuals. Look at unconfirmed transactions and transaction costs. Last time we pumped, alot of that hype was killed because people realised transactions were slow and expensive which is not what you want. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 01:54:07
When someone sends funds yesterday and they are stuck in the pool and don't confirm. How is this not a concern in your mind?? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:51:12
When I see posts like this, I cringe every time 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:29:55
2btc for that beauty is a steal! Especially since BTC is dropping faster than a hot potato. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:52:51
Not sure about you but it's hard to replenish in Aus. Requires me wiring money to an exchange, waiting a few days to clear before I can buy and the price can change wildly. Having fiat on an exchange constantly for the off chance I need to replenish is very inconvenient and a terrible buying experience as I have to put in orders that partially fill ect. 
Ever since banks changed buying from coin base to akin to a cash advance, I haven't actually bought any. Only crypto I get now a days is from mining. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:18:20
Im saying it is as liquid right now and in some cases more efficient in its liquidity. Its not as tradable and sure there are more places that will take gold for cash but last I checked its easier to send BTC to someone than it is to send gold whether it be down the road or the other side of the world and I can turn it into cash more conveniently without leaving my house to either physically sell it or verify its integrity. Having said that, there's an argument that you can infact buy things with btc if you choose. Can you buy games on steam with gold like you can with btc? Is amazon planning on accepting gold as a form of payment like they are planning on accepting btc?

@_date: 2017-10-02 13:16:35
I can sell my btc anytime I want whether it be 4pm or 2am from the comfort of my own house and have it in my account in 1 day. Is it really less liquid than gold given I can do that?
