Look for an Bitcoin ATM nearby. If there is none ask Family/Friends to buy some Bitcoin for you

Really you shouldn't regret this. No one can predict these massive bullruns. It could also go the other way and you would lose money. Invest what you can afford in 5-10 coins you like and hold them. You will def catch a few bullruns that way.

I find it hard to compare bitcoin with the tulip bubble. The tulip bubble popped and never recovered. However Bitcoin had already 2 major corrections (over -90%) and always recovered and surpassed the previous high. The graph however only compares bitcoins increase after the price crash of 2013.

I agree with you on that one. However if only the best cryptocurrency from a technical point would be used, people would switch the currencies every few years for a new solution. There will be always a new project which has new and better technology than the older ones like it's the case with tech companies. There will always be competition. I believe that we will stick to the cryptocurrency with the longest history and the one that has sustained attacks and implement or improve its technology rather than switching to new currencies. If that's not the case all cryptocurrencies will end up being replaced someday with a value of zero.
Mining is not politically but solely profit driven which also means that there will be always competition and new players involved trying to get a share.

In the longterm altcoins tend to lose satoshi value with big price spikes in between which are usually news or rumour driven.

Bitcoins is the first currency of the modern age which value is determined by consent of the people rather then the government telling you that the 1$ bill is worth 1$.

NASDAQ wants to implement bitcoin futures in 2018. This could give bitcoin another boost and more legitimacy

We get a h&amp;s pattern in btc every month. However that alone doesn't create a bear market because btc price is mostly dominated by new money flowing in.

My most bullish prediction was 5K. I was really stunned to see btc reach 20K.

A high volume can mean that either there are lots of buyers or lots of sellers. It can have a positive or negative effect. Spikes in volume usually occur during price crashes or fast price increases

"Everyone expects.." means it is already priced in.
