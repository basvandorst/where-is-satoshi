You fail to understand the importance of the store name on branding.


Please read the full text, I presented a solution.

They are not decentralised if we have to use your API to access it.
You already stated that to avoid collisions you wont resolve ID/ but only the U/ namespace.
And then why does your Passcards site mention Namecoin as a registrar (ID/ namespace) , if you are not planing to answer requests to resolve it!

So why did you use the u/ namespace, when id/ was already available and created back in 2011 for this purpose?


What happened to OpenName:
and why is suddenly being redirected to passcard.info ?

ok, so the OpenName protocol was renamed to Passcards. Now on Passcard I found this:


There are 2 registrars:
OneName and Namecoin
Why is Namecoin "Developers Only"?
 Developers only?
What happens if some one registers their store name on Namecoin, instead of OneName, will the OneName web API resolve those requests too?

So you will only resolve the u/ namespace, that means that the only way to register OpenBazaar names is under it. And you have stated that you may move away form Namecoin using Blockstore. 
How is this a better alternative than resolving store names using the multiple available Namecoin Explorers like: 
We know that this is an stable decentralized and independent protocol, that is easy to integrate and available today.
What does OneName bring to the table that improves over this? 
How do we know your control over the U/ namespace wont be abused?

Read the title again: "OpenBazaar store name **registration** compromised""
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:10:02
ok got it. So your API also resolves store names that are registered on the id/ namespace?
And if so what happens when the names of a store exist on the 2 namespaces? Will you return the store id of the one that was registered via OneName, or the one that was manually registered on Namecoin?
You need to realise that in order for the ideal of a unique decentralised place for IDs, there needs to be only one. That this was defined way before OneName came to existence, and that is the ID/ namespace. This is the one that is backed by Namecoin community and that is and will always be independent of the interests of corporations.
