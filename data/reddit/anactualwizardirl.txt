Whilst I realise your just being sarcastic, theres an awful lot of people who actually do think Al Jazeera are some sort of shady terrorists because they don't always tell the sides of story the American Neo-con establishment wants folks to hear. The irony is, Islamist terrorists hate Al Jazeera because of the news networks constant denunciation of terrorisms malign influence on the middle east. 
As was once noted during the Iraq war when both sides of the conflict where shooting at Al Jazeera journalists, if both sides of a war hate your journalism, its probably because your telling the truth.

I just had an app rejected by Apple because the website it pulls an "About" page from mentions the word "Android". As much as I feel duty bound to be nice to apple, because I get my income making apps for their platform, they really can be quite horrible sometimes.
edit: I'm new to this bitcoin business. How do I get myself a bitcoin address without risking it getting hacked (No offense, but the record of online wallets isnt a good one so far). I'm tempted to offer some services writing apps for bitcoins. Considering I usually charge about $3K Aud for a small app up to $8K Aud for a large comercial app, what would be a good rate to charge?
edit: Woah @ the rage dude in the reply. Chill out man.

Holy crap dude. Mellow out you god damn nut. 
I'm an Objective C coder and yes this is exactly what has happened to my clients app. Theres a sign up page (UIViewController wrapped page) that links to a sign up for a newsletter. It asks if they are interested in info on the Android product or IOS product. 
As a result I was violated on section 3.1 of their app store review guidelines. I'll quote their exact text;-








I do this for a living. I do not code android (That'd be my business partner. For reference I cant stand Java), so uh, find something rational to be angry about please before embarassing yourself in future by accusing strangers of being liars.
