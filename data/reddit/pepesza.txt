You guys are doing awesome work. Ethereum project is in dire need of good hardware wallets and you are delivering! More - recently I bought myself a Ubikey Nano. Fast forward few months - you have replicated its functionality! Now I have two independently implemented U2F tokens :)
I bought 3 Trezors for the price of 2 in 2014 and value for a buck has been amazing since!

Do you have a bank account? If yes than you can use BitSquare. It's p2p but it does not require you to go out and meet people.

I think you are supposed to create an invoice and put it here. What you've posted looks like bitcoin address, not LN address/invoice.
