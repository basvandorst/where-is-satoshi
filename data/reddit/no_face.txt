I'm not sure what the point is, but from the perspective of a merchant, its impossible to plan anything without predictibility.
VISA fees vary by amount, not by how congested their network is when a payment is processed. Therefore, I can use my estimated turnover to figure out the cost. I can add the cost to my products price. Same with paypal.
The real issue with bitcoin is not that payment varies by tx size (which is OK and can be planned for) but the fact that the fees may need to go 10x or even 100x due to traffic at an unknown point in time. This reduces predictability and will discourage use unless the fee is comparatively tiny as it was a couple of years ago, when you could send a tx for $0.005

Hi, first of all, thanks for answering all questions. 
I have some questions about lightning that I did not get answers anywhere else. Perhaps you can put these to rest once and for all:
1. If we have a million users for lightning (very small compared to actual crypto community), how do you expect the routing to scale? Given that finding a route in a *static* graph is [O(V^2 )]( without using a min-priority heap (which cannot be used on a large dynamic graph)
2. Given that the problem is not simple routing but really a maxflow problem, how do you estimate the routing to find a route with sufficient liquidity for my transaction? 
3. Given that the liquidity changes every second and these are NOT broadcast (offchain), how do you deal with a network where the available liquidity is changing very fast? Isnt there a latency between computing the route and using it? Wont the routes found be stale before they can be used?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:15:13
85? I see 99% male in every chatroom.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:16:35
The heuristic you give is clever but brings in the implied requirement that channels hold much higher liquidity than the average transaction. Has this been implemented or is this still in exploration?
O(E+VlogV) requires arranging the graph in a Fib-heap. 
1. Will this be updated constantly as the graph changes?  
2. Does this mean when I open/close a channel, I need to broadcast it to everyone so that they can update their fib-heap?  
3. I suppose its ok for micropayments. Do you see this as a limiting factor for larger payments? 
Thanks for the answers. Its really helping me understand.

There are open source scripts that will take a random bitstring and convert it into a HDW key. This should address risks of poor randomness in ledger.
The other concerns are when the ledger device falls into the hands of someone else, ie there could be a backdoor or side channel attack which shows the keys. 
The only way around this is to multisig your funds and hold keys on different ledgers which are split up among different locations/people. Kinda OK for cold storage, perhaps a smaller amount on a normal address for hot wallet.

As I understand it, big miners with fast connections can create pathologically large blocks that would give them an edge and drive off small miners, resulting in centralization.
The actual size that is safe is not agreed upon. Most are of the agreement that 2MB is safe. 
Small blockers believe that the safety zone ends near 4MB or perhaps 8MB.
Large blockers believe that no upper bound is necessary since game theory would prevent large blocks with occasional exceptions.

Total cost to network is an absurd thing to compute. You could have 200 nodes or 50,000 nodes in a couple of years for all you know. In any case, the individual miner is only concerned with the cost-benefit effects for his personal operation.
The essay is written discounting the dramatic appreciation bitcoin is expected to have. This entire fear of miners leaving on big blocks is predicated on bitcoin stagnating in value at *today's prices*.
A bitcoin worth of fees from a the early years is worth 100x today. Fees of today will be worth 100x in another few years. This is why the subsidy cuts off. In 150 years, the tiny numeric subsidy would be worth a lot more than the block rewards of today.
The cost of running a node is about $50/year on a VPS with 256GB storage. (Maybe there are cheaper alternatives)
Assuming I make $50 per year in bitcoin fees + block rewards, I'm at breakeven.
Number of transactions per year = approx 75M at 200K trans/day
cost of a transaction per node = $0.000000685

Thanks for improving my understanding. Would really appreciate answers to a few basic questions:
Does LN automatically figure out if there is a path from Alice to Carol or is it upto Alice to first discover the path?
When the network gets big, won't finding a path become increasingly slow, i.e. O(V+E)
What happens if Bob goes offline mid-way though my channel operation? Is the channel re-routed? What if there is no other route?
Why isnt it more practical for Alice to simply open a channel with Carol instead of finding a route through multiple mid-nodes that need to be online all the time?

I dont even know how to sell large quantities of btc without having the sale proceeds frozen for indefinite time until questions are answered to their satisfaction.
Say I sold 100 BTC, thats just over 600K. However, the bank can freeze it and demand the entire history of transactions that went into buying it. If you have 100 btc, you probably bought when it was single digits on mtgox, which no longer exists, so you cant prove history.

This is true for many metals, including Ruthenium, Rhodium, Platinum, etc. Yet they are not hoarded/used as currency. Some of them score better than gold on the features above.
Gold just happens to be used historically, that's all. Its value is due to market forces (i.e. hoarding) and not physical properties.
Think of hoarding this way: If a stock is owned mostly by institutions, its called accumulation and the value is expected to go up. If it moves from institutions to the general public, its called distribution and the value goes down. 
Price stability is proportional to the amount of shares changing hands and when the share is small, the price is relatively stable.

Seems to speculation on OP's part. Why does it need to be invested in "high quality" investments? Why should it be invested in something denominated in USD? Why not Euro-bonds or Gold or Oil? 


Front-running does not make sense except for market orders. Front-running may be done by professional traders/bots which have access to advanced analytics and/or privileged feeds/infrastructure. It does not make profitable sense for an exchange to front run its own order book using market orders (try running randomized experiments)
In a limit order book, the customer's orders won't be affected. Customer orders will either execute at specified price or order will be unfilled. Also, an exchange cannot insert a new order ahead of an existing order at the same price without being detected. Although they could attempt this on a different exchange, in general the flow of orders would fluctuate wild enough that it would be unprofitable. Remember that 90% of the orders are cancelled and not executed.

I think you're missing the point here. Why does gold have value? [Because governments hoard it](
Their act of hoarding and protecting vast reserves by multiple powerful entities is what assures the public that it will continue to have value for a long time.
Does that mean you wont make wedding rings and such with it? Of course not. The hoarding by powerful entities is exactly what gives you assurance about gold's value and makes your transactions with gold meaningful and credible.
Compare to commodities such as oil and copper, which while valuable are not a store of value in ordinary times but become stores of value when they are hoarded (like a wartime) or cocaine in south america, which is effectively treated as currency in some regions.

Im assuming that by "bruteforce private key" you mean that you take a bitcoin address that has coins, get a pre-image public key from it and then do a discrete log to get the private key.
Here are the problems with this:
1. RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256 do not have a known pre-image attack. In theory it would take 2^80 attempts for you to crack the former and 2^128 attempts to crack the latter on the average case get the public key.
2. From the public key, getting the private key is the discrete log problem, considered infeasible for secp256k1.

If you were referring to the birthday collision, does not apply here because that would require 2^128 UTXOs.
In reality, 7 billion people with say 100 private keys each is only 2^40
So you would have about 2^40 / 2^128 = 1 in 2^88 each second for a 50% probability. Also, you would need to keep track of 2^256 addresses so that you don't retry the same address over. This would require more atoms than the solar system even if one atom stores one bit.
I get your point tho, the hash rate growth is probably a sigmoid curve and will start to flatten in a few years.

oh, then its 2^256, which is way bigger than 2^128
EDIT: So your chances of hitting an output = UTXO size / 2^256 
= 2^16 / 2^256 = 1 in 2^240 per try. 
At 2^128 hashes/second, ~ 2^110 seconds or so, it would take longer than multiple times the age of the universe to hit one loaded key on average. Also, it would consume more than the lifetime energy output of every star in the galaxy for you to even count till 2^256

This is not about blocksize, but TX size. 
A good solution may be to tie the fee to the number of UTXO being spent ( verified) but make it a parameter that the miner can set.
TX size = in\*180 + out\*34 + 10 ± in
Lets make fees/in = 
                1000 sat for     1 to   100 in
               10000 sat for   101 to  1000 in
              100000 sat for 10001 to 10000 in

Im not quite sure what's going on, but its a mexican standoff with the nodes, miners and dev team.
All 3 have separation of powers and just like a government, things move slowly.
The dev are like the legislature, they make the laws.
The miners are the executive, they enforce the laws (by only mining valid transactions)
The nodes are the judiciary, they can strike down miner and dev actions (by rejecting blocks and not upgrading code).
And just like the government, each branch thinks its the most important. 
As should be expected, the executive has the most to benefit from usurping power.
Peaceful transfer of power in all three branches is probably the next step in evolution of decentralized governance.

The whole point of lightening in my understanding is that I dont have to wait for bitcoin confirmations because txs are verified between me and other parties. 
In general, I think commercial uses for lightening will overtake personal uses simply because companies usually know their budgets upfront for various activities
I'm not sure personal uses such as coffee provides a desirable mode of operation. This entire business of locking funds makes me a bit skeptical. Its no longer cash, its more like a pre-paid gift-card.
I would have to know that I want to spend $60 on coffee and $30 on laundry. What if I spill coffee on all my clothes in the closet and need more for laundry this month? I have to close the channel and re-open it later?
I would rather pool it all in one wallet and spend as necessary and not have to know how much exactly I want to spend for every little thing.

*Almost all transactions are free.  A transaction is over the maximum size limit if it has to add up more than 500 of the largest payments you've received to make up the amount.  A transaction over the size limit can still be sent if a small fee is added.*
*The average transaction, and anything up to 500 times bigger than average, is free.*
*It's only when you're sending a really huge transaction that the transaction fee ever comes into play, and even then it only works out to something like 0.002% of the amount.  It's not money sucked out of the system, it just goes to other nodes.  If you're sad about paying the fee, you could always turn the tables and run a node yourself and maybe someday rake in a 0.44 fee yourself.*

QRCode for device to device
Every wallet and software now have to rewrite and test code to make it compatible, that's why. If segwit just uses the P2SH format, adoption is a lot easier.
Segwit adoption is stuck at 28%. Its hard enough to convince people to upgrade a node. Imagine telling them that everything needs to change, from their wallets to hardware keys to scripts to accomodate this.
I think its simpler if segwit is activated with minimum hassle and push this as an upgrade once we have penetration.
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:52:49
I'm a big fan of Pieter Wuille but this new format seems to solve a problem that does not exist.

Look, I get the hate for GMax and Luke Jr. They are socially .... shall we say ... unsophisticated. But that should not take away from their technical contributions.
Its a good thing that other core devs are staying away from the controversy or their good name would be spoiled too.
Gavin is a great developer and I respect all he has done for Bitcoin. Lets hope the political divide is erased one day and we have all of them back on the team.
And I totally get the big block side. I  have said many times big blocks would be fine; but this reflects my needs, biases and probably limited understanding.

Grouping royalties: I may want to pay royalties in one TX to a group so that they can verify that the proper %age has been paid to participants.
Voting and voting acknowledgement: One way to vote and record the vote on the blockchain is to send coins to an address, which returns coins to the senders. 
Right now, you are already thinking of alternate ways to do the above. That is good. It means these applications are legitimate and there are probably a thousand others for which you cannot think of alternatives.

BIP 70 has no traction because its solving a problem that does not really exist.
Take a look at its claims:


I don't see this as an advantage. Almost everyone copies and pastes the address or scans a QRCode.


Blockchain is secure proof of payment. If the merchant is untrustworthy and habitually denies receiving payment, they will go out of business fast. Since a scam site can easily accept payments for 2 weeks even with bip 70, close shop and reopen with another name, I doubt this is more than very slightly useful.


MITM can only happen when not using https or when the customers computer is malware infected. And if so, this wont stop it.


Again, every website already does this automatically without the need for a protocol


The current practice of returning a payment to the source address is very traceable and transparent and better than sending it to a change address in the rare event an order cannot be fulfilled.
I think the key flaw with bip70 is that it takes pure information like an address and converts it into a protocol, which requires infrastructure and maintenance. This is why it has failed and my guess is it will never take off.
I get it. You are UX and want the user to have a better experience. But seriously, how is any of this better than scanning a QR code?

Ships have been historically well armed. The British Navy grew powerful from arming vessels transporting gold and spices from South Asia. 
Indian trade was so profitable that pirates would specifically target East India Company ships. East India company started arming themselves so well that they eventually assisted various small Indian kingdoms in small wars and ended up owning parts of India.
This is why in movies like "Pirates of the Carribean" they like to feature the East India company.

To be fair, thats just payment channels, and everyone is ok with it. Lightening is routing on top of payment channels, which still does not exist.
Handwired routes or payment hubs have been badmouthed, but they would form a good starting point that will at least get the ball rolling and get users familiar with things such as lightening wallets, hub funding etc.
What we really need is the possibility to earn small fees from running hubs, this would decentralize the network again and all the dissent will disappear

i dont have millions but Im willing to donate/test/code. If lightning works, this is the end of central banks. I just need to know that the network will actually exist. I dont mean the tech, which I think is good and has a couple of issues (UX, routing) but they are probably solvable.
I mean the network should exist in the sense important economic actors such as Coinbase should run lightning nodes and enable lightning payments and withdrawals. A viable network where I can send and receive payments just like onchain btc. Requiring a user to open and close channels themselves at $30 a pop is simply not going to fly. Requiring all channels to have amounts much larger than the typical payment is also overoptimistic. Users can barely manage their own private keys and segwit has mediocre adoption so Im not very optimistic about users exerting any effort to use lightning.
What kind of lightning network should exist? Currently, I dont know what I should do to send a lightning payment to someone. Will the wallet tell me:
* "The max you can send to Joe is 0.0001 btc. If you want to send more, please open a new channel" or 
* "could not find a route or all routes are busy" or 
* "the payment you sent failed because the liquidity of one of the channels in the route dropped before your tx was sent". 
What would I do at this point? send an on-chain tx? if this happens more than 2 times, I probably will never use LN. I want it to *just work* like sending an on-chain tx.

Seems there is a big startup opportunity if someone can make this seamless. 
If person A wants to receive 3 BTC from person B:
Step 1. A has channels open with lightening nodes L1, L2, L3
Step 2: Software computes that there are sufficient routes that have 2 BTC payable to A via L1,L2,L3. 
Missing step 3: Somehow add 1 btc to one of As open channels
Step 4: Send 3 BTC using all open channels
Until missing step 3 is in place, I dont see lightening as being widely useful. If Im ignorant about something here, please educate me (and also im sure many others)

Exhausted channel refresh means: close existing channel and open new one. Thats 2 on chain tx
Open a direct channel is better, 1 on chain tx
Again, I don't see why the user won't simply send the 3 BTC as 1 on chain regular tx. There is no incentive to open a channel with a random internet person whom you do not expect to do regular business with. As far as I can see, lightning does not help any scaling here.
I've been trying to find a good business use case for lightning that is not already addressed by payment channels. There seems to be none.

The article has some factual errors even though its overall message has some merit.
Basically, current law requires anyone working on wall street to require a fingerprint FBI check and a background check.
Finger prints submitted in ink have to be renewed every two years. (This may have changed recently due to electronic readers)
The goal of bitlicence is to ensure that any new bitcoin business follows the stringent regulations that investment banks follow. 
From the perspective of someone who's worked on wall st, this may seem natural but the net effect is that a company without a fully staffed compliance team will not be able to comply, i.e. unless you already have $1M in funding.
I believe BitLicence is caused by general incompetence rather than active malice.

Totally poor analogy, but maybe someone can make it better:
The Fed prints notes at semi-fixed rate which is roughly equal to the rate of fed fund rate. Think of this as analogous to bitcoin mining except that the block reward is tied to the fed rate and in turn to inflation instead of a steadily being halved every two years. Occasionally, however, serious situations warrant Quantitative Easing (QE) that prints a crapload more than expected. Since the crisis of 2008, this is sort of out of whack and QE has been pretty much disconnected from fed rate.

This is new information to me. I thought segwit was a soft fork and is opt-in. If a miner sends his coinbase tx to a non-segwit address, it can be lost? How is that possible if old style tx still valid?

Bitcoinica essentially crossed orders and took a position on the difference to hedge against market moves.
Lets say all the buyers bought 30000 BTC and all the sellers sold 25000 BTC. Now Bicoinica only needs to buy 5000 BTC to hedge against an upside move.
Since they quote a price thats slightly higher than Mt. Gox, they can amortize the costs partly among the 55000 buys and sells.
So yes, its a bucket shop with some risk management on top.

As long as I can just use it like a regular wallet, I welcome LN. This means I should be able to send and receive coins without much preparation and thought regarding, opening, closing, renegotiating, dealing with non-coperative counterparty, coins locked due to protocol issues.
Im yet to see a good use case for LN among small players. Paypal was originally meant to send small amounts of money to friends. Their advertizing even showed friends splitting a check. But with anything payments, especially if it works well, eventually most volume will be driven through large entities.

Usability Issues:
1. Channels have a limited lifetime: Why? Why can't they be open indefinitely like checking accounts and closed at will?
2. Routing needs to be completely transparent to the average user. Bitcoiners shouldnt even have to explain this to non-technical people. 
3. Closing and disconnection issues will mean that its unlikely anyone will open a channel with an internet stranger. In the beginning, only reputed companies will serve as channel counterparties
4. Attorneys: Fuck this. I don't need an attorney to close my checking account. I have to pay some shyster to handle closure of my coffee money? This is a non-starter.
5. The biggest usability issue is the limited amount you can transact. Most users will have no idea how much they need to commit to a channel. Ideally, they want to commit zero and add payments as and when necessary. So a unidirectional channel works well for subscription services etc, but bidirectional and routing need to be proven in the market by at least two large players before this takes off.

Nick Szabo is a hyper-smart guy who is well-versed on many topics. But that's not a polymath. A polymath is someone who has made outstanding contributions in many fields. 
Examples: 
Leonardo da Vinci: invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture. 
Gallileo: astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and mathematician.

Varporware means it does not exist. Smart contracts do exist and work right now and is already a multi-billion dollar economy. Smart contract does not require something like Solidity. Multisignature addresses are smart contracts for example.
I think you mean to say "Code is Law" style thinking is delusional, and I agree.
Monero does add value regardless of fiat. The fact that I know someone has 7000 BTC is dangerous for that person. Transacting in Monero can protect you from being a target if your public key is ever exposed/subject to chainanalysis.
Speed is not something I worry about now. Except for in-store retail, waiting 10 min should not be an issue. If in-store retail suddenly gets traction, the market will figure out how to solve it.

[Proof of work was invented]( by [Cynthia Dwork]( et al, a distinguished researcher from Microsoft Research in 1992.
Hashcash is best an implementation of this idea with a few wrinkles. Adam [credits Cynthia]( on his site. 
This is not to say Adam has not done any work in crypto. He has indeed contributed many papers to crypto and distributed systems. However, appropriating Cynthia's work and pretending its the central piece of bitcoin by stating "Bitcoin is hashcash with inflation control" is laughable and borders on plagiarism. 
Adam, you can stand on your own feet and dont need to absorb credit for bitcoin. You had little to do with it bro, and your claims are not credible. But the point is you are trying to contribute now and we all appreciate it.

@_date: 2016-10-16 07:30:15
hold on, if its pay to pubkey hash, then all I have to do is find any pubkey that hashes to the pubkey hash correct? its a hash collision problem for 160 bits? So at most I would need to try 2^(160) items?

I have no idea what rainbow tables have to do with this but your questions are not a good source of entropy:
1 My dog’s nickname when I was 7 years old   
2 The name of the city where I broke my ankle  
3 The last name of the girl I slept with at the party “love the fun” of my school HEC  
4 The first name of the friend I lived with for 3 months when I was in Barcelona in 2012  
5 The first word of the video game me and my little brother Frank played when we were on holidays at Cousons  
6 The name of my Warcraft 3 clan  
7 My friend Aurélien Dupont’s nickname  
8 The last name of the farmer from which my uncle Samuel Laurent has been buying milk his whole life  
9 The mark of cigarettes my friend Amy was smoking in 1999  
10 The city where I proposed to my wife  
Notice that 9 of 10 questions here are names. Human and place names are a very small set if they know where you live. Names are also the easiest things for someone targeting your list to discover.
Your questions should have verbs and adjectives as answers as well. Even so, humans are not a good source of entropy and its often hard to see.
Your idea is probably workable with the caveat that "hiding in plain sight" will probably fail if someone gets the list of questions. Maybe not for your example, but for a general user who has his life all over facebook.
EDIT: I also wanted to point out that the security of Trezor etc are due to the permutations of the words rather than knowledge of the words themselves. You would need to prove that your key has an entropy of around 256 bits. For a 24 word permutation (even when you know all the words) the entropy is 24!, which is slightly over 256 bits.

You may be safe from a random internet cracker, but I'd be worried that my school buddy or close relative knows the answers to most of these questions. That's what kills entropy. You would need a secret life whose details few know about.
If you depend on the *knowledge* of answers for entropy, it would be hard to squeeze 256 bits from the details of your life. If you depend on *permutation* you have a lot more possibilities. It may be simpler to remember "john betty 2014-05-01 Marlboro" than "correct battery staple horse". Not sure how you can work it in your scheme.

Let me clarify, the address on the server side is not a global server address, its a server side address unique to a user:
    
    user            wallet             address on server
    user1          13ab...            149mBZ...
    user2          1Nqe...            1gH83s....
    user3          1Gher...           18Uyw....
As long as user1 uses a different wallet address everytime (or very often), is there any privacy loss if the server continues to use 149mBZ... address for him? I don't see how this server side address can be exposed if only the relevant user sees it

As I predicted, segwit activation on LTC is taking the fear away.
In a few months or weeks, segwit will seem like a "normal" thing and all risks will be addressed and quantified. This may mean miners will be bolder to signal segwit. End of this year and 95% is probably not realistic, but activation does not look very far.

If you have heirs, they can basically hold your coins for ever even if BTC goes down in the near future. Just make sure the private key is passed somehow. 
I would suggest multisig or CLTV, but unless they are bitcoin savvy, they will probably not able to access it and your coins will be effectively lost.
For heirs who are crypto-illiterate, Im guessing you keep coins in a locked box and tell them about the coins and where the private keys are. They can get the key after you passing away using the usual means of inheritance.
But good luck. Hopefully, you can stretch your life for another couple of years to see bitcoin hit 5,000 at least

I think the real issue is that the routing stuff is not clearly described anywhere:


So I open a LN channel with *anyone* I want to transact with? So instead of sending coins using 1 on-chain TX, I create two, one for open and 1 for close? Isn't this worse? The only reasonable way to deal with this is connect to well connected parties, who are effectively hubs.


Unless my computer is on all the time and listening for broadcast of old tx


I can send bitcoins anywhere now. I don't need intermediaries to route my payment. I don't need intermediaries who have sufficient coins in channels every hop along the route. 
If there are insufficient intermediaries, me and the payee should hit the network with 2 more txs.


This reasonably well connected network does not exist. Lets see if one develops on Litecoin and this may shed light on a lot of issues that seem murky at present.

If men want to be a nurse or a teacher, they just do it. They dont demand to "feel welcomed"


Try to understand that humor is not derisive or judgemental. Humor is how we deal with the hard parts of reality. While men and women can both be hysterical, women are easily forgiven for it (and may abuse this privilege)


This is about incentives. Women have a lot more options in life than men. A woman can simply marry an accomplished man and not worry about being accomplished herself. A man does not have this option. A woman can choose to work in ancillary fields of technology and engineering such as recruiting and marketing both of which are female dominated. A woman can prioritize her family over work and be lauded for it. The number of women who choose to go into engineering is low because it doesnt make sense to do hard, boring work when you can get an equivalent lifestyle doing something easier.

Correct me if Im wrong but here are the scenarios:
Scenario 1: BIP 148 gets less than 15% hash rate (likely unless there is a lot of hidden hashrate)
1. Segwit will not activate on BIP148 nodes
2. Segwit will activate on Seg2x and legacy segwit core. 
3. Any pre-segwit legacy core will be backward compatible and will see Anyone Can Spend Tx.
4. BIP 148 chain dies or hardforks
Scenario 2: BIP 148 gets more than 15% hashrate
1. Chain splits
2. Reorg risk on non BIP 148 chains
3. Bitcoin ABC may be adopted by miners

Supply will be cut in half. But that's just supply of the fraction that miners sell. Many miners are also HODLers, holding part of their stash to sell on price surges. How much they sell every time is unknown. Some miners probably sell everything.
The overall bitcoin price is a function of the current demand/supply. This can change due to a variety of reasons and is hard to predict.
But overall, supply will reduce dramatically, which should lead to a price surge assuming current HODLers dont dump on the first post-halvening price surge.

Anyone can code/propose a change in the protocol. However, a chain exists if there is sufficient hashrate behind it.
Successful changes to bitcoin so far:
* CLTV
* P2SH
* P2PKH
* CSV
Failed protocol changes:
* Segwit
The hashpower did not follow this one, that's all. Its upto the people sponsoring a change to ensure that hashpower follows.


Where is data/proof showing the *need*? What marks a coin as a reserve currency? Not challenging you, just curious to know


Any proposal that can drag along the majority of hashpower will win. Its just the way bitcoin is designed.


Again, users will vote with their wallet. If they don't care, they will stay. If not, they will move. 


The world is already a better place. There are plenty of decentralized currencies with low fees. Heck, Litecoin even has segwit. Low fee use cases will move off bitcoin and onto other chains.

Let me weigh in as a professional trader.
First of all, the price is always right, regardless of fundamentals, the greatness of the underlying instrument, etc. A small subset of people may think goggles for dogs are going to change the world because there are 1 Billion dogs and they all need goggles and so on. Your reasoning no matter how accurate is irrelevant. Price is driven by demand and supply and nothing else.
Secondly, pump and dump works like this: A pump and dumper buys large quantities of an *unknown low price, low volume instrument*, typically a penny stock and then advertises it on bulk-email, trading boards, etc. When the price moves even slightly, he unloads it. This only works because he expects far more buyers (read demand) than he can sell. A pump and dump is *ineffective* and *counterproductive* for something that's expensive already in a trend like bitcoin.
Professional traders (as opposed to investors):
* do not pay attention to fundamentals, news, etc. 
* do not pump and dump
* look at the market as an abstract entity, not a pool of idiots to take advantage of
* they are concerned with their own profits and losses and are not concerned with *driving the price down further than they themselves can*
Any idea about conspiracy to control price of something that has a market cap of a billion dollars is missing the point. Even big trading desks at investment banks have a tough time moving the market even on a small stock.
The reason BTC sold off is that it doubled in price in a few short days. One of the golden rules of trading is that when something doubles in a couple of days, watch for a deep and prolonged pullback. Its best to sell if you are a trader. For an investor, the time to sell is when everyone is talking about buying it. You will hear your office mates, beer buddies and even random strangers discussing it. We are quite far from it at this point, so you can hold for another push up.

The only thing wrong in that picture is the words "absolute zero". At absolute zero, it does not cost any energy to flip a bit. Instead it should read "at the cosmic background temperature of *average* 2.725K"
The *average* amount of energy to flip a bit is  **kT ln(W)**, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and W is the number of possible states. For a binary machine, W=2
Therefore the *average* amount of energy to flip a bit at universe background temperature 2.725 is
= 2.608 * 10^-23 J/K* 2.725 K * 0.693 
= 4.926 * 10^-23 Joules
Also, 2^256 is about 1.16\*10^77 and the energy required to flip a bit 2^256 times is 5.704\*10^54 J.
Note that this would require graycode computer to ensure you only need to flip one bit to increment the count once, regular binary circuits flip lot more bits.
Note that the *total lifetime* energy output of the sun  aprox 10^44 J
Therefore the *minimum average energy* needed to flip a bit 2^256 times is approximately equal to the lifetime output of about 10^10 suns.

When people are thinking of selling the farm to invest in something, its usually the sign of a top.

That said, I'm holding and not selling because I'm a professional trader and am confident I can see the top and exit with most of my gains. The market trend can go on indefinitely and until the trend is broken, I prefer to hold.

Where do you infer that AES-128 is used?
from 
var crypted = Crypto.AES.encrypt(json, password);
Sending the password, [picks AES-256](
CryptoJS supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. It will pick the variant by the size of the key you pass in. If you use a passphrase, then it will generate a 256-bit key
It is common practice to use base64 to protect against injection attacks for example, to guard against characters like single quote in the password causing issues.
No Salt is bad for storing passwords, or where the plaintext is known (or guessed). When its unknown like in the json wallet, a salt does not add security. (It may add some entropy, but thats debatable)
SHA256 rounds are only used to verify the second password, not to store it. There is no sense in even using more than one round as long as salt is used. They use the shared key as salt -- no idea what this means -- but should probably be a per-user salt. No one has been able to successfully pre-image attack sha256.

I cannot predict if bitcoin will indeed be the currency of the future, but its obvious that it fills a largely unmet need. Bitcoin or something like it, is bound to shift the entire payment system around in the next decade or so.
Any new technical breakthrough will go through repeat boom-and-bust cycle. That's part of the risk of investing. At a certain point, it makes sense to sell into extreme strength (such as the recent $900 push)
Personally, I'm planning to sell a bit on every new push beyond $900. Thats because I believe in sell-often sell early. The right time to sell will be pretty obvious because everyone will be talking about bitcoin and selling the farm and borrowing money to buy it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:12:08
Ok, I concede the point.
However, my point regarding the way someone with 1000BTC would trade still stands. They are unlikely to place a single order at a single price and suffer a poor price. Its more likely they would sell bit by bit to maximize value.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:16:01
This is a great idea, but I'd like to make to suggestions which will make the product more useful. 
On the side opposite to the private key, the public key should be etched or printed. If its simpler, then it may be ok to put the public key right above the private key on the same side.
 For the most part this will eliminate the need to input the private key to figure out which public key is for which card.
The price point is ok in my opinion, since the folks who will get this probably have more than a couple of BTC to worry about.
However, you may want to consider a 50% discount for "early adopters" or "holiday season" just to get the word out there.

WTF?? Who would send their login info to someone else? And why would you deal with someone who doesnt have basic common sense? 1st sign of fishy situation. I'm assuming he sent a link to a fake site with a link similar to blockchain but actually going to a different site via email and a username password.


They guy gave you 0.19 bitcoin extra free for half the agreed amount of LTC because "you gave him a good deal?" If it looks too good to be true it probably is.


This means someone had a public key and added it to the wallet. The address could be a cold wallet or someone else's public key. If they were all your addresses, then he simply added them as watch only since he did not have the private key to them.
Cannot really comprehend what he wrote. Does it means you logged in with someone else's email. That's just reckless.
Also you dont need to open your account to check the balance. You can just type in the address on blockchain (you do know your address without opening your wallet, right?)
Dude, all this sucks. But this is why we have exchanges. Trade at btc-e.com or other reputable exchange if you want to move between LTC/BTC. Dont do it with random strangers on the internet. This story has all the elements of a drug deal gone bad.
5BTC is a lot for many people and I feel you. Be glad you werent one of the early adopters who would have 500BTC for the same amount of money.
Reset yourself. Shit happens. As always with money, be cautious and always avoid suspicious situations. Remember the old adage: "You can't con an honest John".

When the price is shooting up, traders do not say: "hey let me sell everything in one order and take whatever we get"
They sell bit by bit in batches and want to maximize their price for it over a period of time.

India is an ideal market for bitcoin for the following reasons:
* Banking service is pretty terrible
* Long lines
* Need to be very careful near ATMs. (Ok, this is true in much of the world)
* Currency is highly susceptible to inflation. Government prints money at will.
* Huge remittance market. Not only Indian citizens from 1st world send money to India, but also citizens from Bangladesh and less affluent neighboring countries send money out of India 
* Large cell-phone market
Right now, a small bunch of techies know about Bitcoin but with the right service providers, this could be boom town. Note that US has been able to control inflation very well for decades, but Indian Rupee is highly susceptible to oil prices and general government mis-management.

The May 6, 2010 Flash Crash[1] also known as The Crash of 2:45, the 2010 Flash Crash or just simply, the Flash Crash, was a United States stock market crash on Thursday May 6, 2010 in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged about **1000 points (about 9%)** only to recover those losses within minutes. It was the second largest point swing, 1,010.14 points, and the biggest one-day point decline, 998.5 points, on an intraday basis in Dow Jones Industrial Average history
There is no formal definition of what is a correction, bear move or crash. But I have noticed TV anchors use the following system.
Informal definitions for a single day move

A lot is different things to different people. 3000BTC is nothing to someone like warren Buffet, but lot to many folks here.
A better way to define a "lot" is that you have made BTC a significant part of your portfolio, say 10%+ for individual investor.

I think you missed the point. They do not store the password with the SHA-256 hash. They only verify it. There are no known pre-image attacks on SHA-* family or even on MD5. Even with excessive computing power, the chances of cracking a salted password is low.
For example, here is a base64 encoded sha256 hash of an unsalted password: PMzOs3WnUNG8plvYp28Ge/2N60RDfGwIPHgIoqmAsjE=
Password is weak: all lower case letters low entropy (english words only). 
Here is the same password with the following salt: "3333":
Here is another password with english words but at least one numeral /capital/special character
You may crack the first two, but the last one i suspect would be close to impossible. 
Will buy reddit gold for a month to the first one who cracks them all.
Good luck.

A well chosen random password 10 characters long from 92 possible keys on the US password has 92^10 combinations. 
At 500Mh/s, it should take about 2755 years to try them all.

On the contrary, bitcoin is amazingly more liquid. This is because you can trade 0.0000000001 bitcoin whereas, you can only trade 1 share of AAPL.

Were the password hashes salted?
EDIT: I see the password hashes were salted and 7500 rounds. I see no problem with this leak. **There are no known collisions ever found for SHA-256. Your passwords are safe**
