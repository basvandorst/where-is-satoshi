I'm not talking about *moving* between chains.  I'm talking about the hundreds of millions of people who are not paying any attention and will be exchanging fiat for crypto.  
As bitcoin rises to stratospheric levels, and they only have, say, $2.00, they may be priced out of the fees in the btc chain; hence I think it's pretty much inevitable that alts will be used.

there are serious differences between open-source and top-down coding.  Mythical man month is right about top-down hierarchies.  But in FOSS the more eyes you have the better.  Why?  Basically because people who already love a project are going there, silently studying the code until they understand it, then propose changes.  
In top-down, it's just a job.  And people haven't been naturally been drawn to it.  And they haven't seen the code.  Hence the increases in time.

As for BFL, they delivered on the FPGAs.  To think that this is a "long con" is to underrate the risk that they would have gone through, by *not knowing whether someone else would bring ASICs before them.* 
I have no interest in the matter; but the sudden amount of FUD doesn't seem legit to me.  At any rate, given that people that send them $ have reasonable concerns, they should start producing some evidence as soon as possible.

@_date: 2012-11-25 02:18:35
It's not bad news.  It's just that the btc market is still so small that a large player can control the price at will.
* For the entire year, pirate has opened huge fake walls and waited as people traded in a tiny range.  Then he would collapse the walls (cancel the buy/sell orders), and start buying or selling with full force.  
* I'm not sure it's pirate, but I know two things:  i) this behavior is still there (look at the fake walls and tiny trading bands); and ii) pirate has a whole lotta bitcoin to play with.  
* I don't think it's a big deal because it doesn't matter in the long run.  As soon as others come and start attacking the walls, or other big players join in, the market is free again to discover price.  
* If I'm right, some time after the drop, there will be a large movement, maybe more than one.
It will be quite interesting to watch.

Oh my god!!! It's not like I have 8000 other songs I could put my private keys on!  I have to put them precisely where I announced to the entire world!! I am so fucked now!!
The whole procedure is:
* create very small truecrypt volume, insert tax files in the main volume, wallet.dat (encrypted with Password A1) in hidden volume.  (Volume is encrypted with password A2, hidden volume with A1+A2+hash(A1+A2))
* Now we have a small file (150k?) with "random data".  I want to insert this file, which looks strange and interesting to an attacker, "random data...?".  
* Get a large mp3 file (4MB+).  Insert the "noise" there, if possible using another password, like hash(A1+A2+hash(A1+A2))  
* Insert the file in *all songs* in a **very** popular just released album you ripped from a newly bought CD on the launch day, upload to the high seas, s3ed for a long time (10 months+), so that the hashes of the files start to become widely distributed all over.  Your private keys are now everywhere, and your files are seen by the totalitarians our there as "normal" (same hashes as lots of other "users").
* Create 10+ backup copies in pendrives; have one everywhere you frequently go.  Create copies in CDs, give it to friends and family.  Use cloud services (and check whether they change the file for some reason or other).
Yes, it's paranoid.  But it's unbreakable enough to me. 
And FAPSLOCK, dude, seriously, if you think I'm thinking steganography do you actually think I'd be broadcasting the precise song here?  Also, if you look  profile, it's just over a month old, and in 3 months it's gone, and a new one comes to light.
The beauty of this thing is that it everything can be automated.

I realized that *that* particular wallet was created rapidly and I didn't use my full hard password.  (in fact, I used the easy passwd I use in websites such as this one).

I mean, really, just look at the ridiculously fake walls  &amp; 10.87.  He's probably moving price below these levels again, prior to the halving.  My bet is he holds the price for these next 900 blocks, and goes on a buying spree after the halving (989 blocks to go now).

I'm looking if I can glue everything up with python.  
So you'd have an **open-source** little app that:
* Gets your password for truecrypt and/or wallet.dat (probably not a good idea to get both, someone might alter the code and scam people).
* Launches truecrypt or downloads it if not installed.
* creates hidden volume, saves wallet there. Offers you the chance to insert some files in non-hidden volume.  Now you have a small file with "random" data.
* launches the steganography app (or downloads it from sourceforge).  I like this project ( but nobody uses .wav anymore.  On the other hand, people could use image files.
* Grabs the .mp3 or folder with the mp3 files and injects the "noise" in it/them.
Another script should undo everything in here, given the passwords.
For today, with ~120M market cap, this is completely over the top.  But what if btc grows 100-fold and reaches 10 Billion+ by 2016/17?  Then the totalitarians start paying attention &amp; this little tool becomes extremely valuable to the community.  
I for one think that printing private keys is a pretty bad idea.  A brainwallet is also risky for the majority of users who do not truly understand how it works and do not take all precautions needed there.
We should assume we're living under totalitarian Stalin &amp; we should assume that (future) users can barely keep their twitter accounts safe.  If btc really grows, and it will, all protection is needed.  This is money we're talking about, after all.
@_date: 2012-10-15 05:24:36
that's pretty cool, but it's lossy.  One bit flipped of a private key, and it's gone. What I'd be looking for would be a way to encode a (very small, cryptographed) wallet.dat into a rather large .mp3.  That would be perfect for hiding the private key in plain sight.

@_date: 2012-09-24 06:10:11
If I understand the security correctly, once you spend (and show your public key), unless you spend *everything* that was in that address, the transaction sends off "the remainder" to a new address (and public key).  Of course, if you use the same address twice, the public key will be available.  
So you send 1btc from A to B.  A had 10BTC.  The transaction is, I believe, A--&gt;1btc to B, and A--&gt;9btc to &lt;New Address&gt;.
am I wrong here?  I think there are two levels of security, which show the genius (and paranoia) of our dear leader Satoshi.

My view on socialism?  How much time do you have?  I basically agree with Thomas Jefferson's views (which means Ron Paul [today]).  
i) I worry about scenarios like "we" (the book).  It seems to be happening  to the occupy people.  They are becoming more and more against individual liberty in the name of "we".  
ii) a light form of socialism seems to work in the scandinavian countries.  Is it sustainable in the long run?  I simply don't know; but what I'm truly against is the state having the power to issue debt.  It is obvious that this will lead to Hayek's road.  
iii) Why do I regularly change accounts on every web service?  Because I think we're facing the specter of "Inverted Totalitarianism", and this is not a "peace and prosperity and freedom" moment of history--not at all.

hahaha, no Floyd, the whole point is to get a new album on the first day when the cd is out, ripit and travel the high seas.  Also, seed from as many machines as possible on the first month, then keep seeding from one machine for a long time.  You want to be the most available copy out there.
Anything very popular will do.  Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, any piece of shit out there that's really popular. 
If you don't want to distribute it, you might want to walk into any university lecture, record it, and save the mp3 in cds, computers, dropbox, everywhere.  To make it really unsuspicious, choose a class that's not related to politics, economics, computer science, etc, but still interests you.  Something like design, or psychology, biology, etc.  Give it to your friends (that you eventually go to their houses) and say "can you keep this for me?  sometimes I get depressed and really love listening to this". Girls specially will keep it if you talk for 10 minutes how special the talk is for you: "Animal behavior is so completely fascinating".

2--&gt; NO WAY.  THEY CAN AND THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY.  It's happened time &amp; time again in history.  It's nothing new.  It will happen this decade many times over.  People doing bank runs are smart, not crazy.  I'm dead serious here; I know people who lost it all in one of those things.


On 1 December 2001, in order to stop this draining from destroying the banking system, the government froze all bank accounts, initially for 90 days. Only a small amount of cash was allowed for withdrawal on a weekly basis (initially 250 Argentine pesos, then 300), and only from accounts denominated in pesos. No withdrawals were allowed from accounts denominated in U.S. dollars, unless the owner agreed to convert the funds into pesos.[2]**   
Sounds familiar?  ask the crowd in 1--&gt; 5% of my (small) net worth is in BTC.  It's ~1 year of savings.  I'd say more than 10% is insane.

Yup; those walls are totally fake and they will vanish if attacked.  He/they stick us into tiny trading bands with huge walls that are mostly fake.  Miners that *need* the money have to sell at that price.  And when there's a significant number of btc (or usd) accumulated on one side or another, he/they does these massive swings.  Been happening for the whole year now.
Not to worry, you can't corner the market forever.  Sometime a big player will just wipe you out.

if you read the thread, they basically conclude that mining is over.  they have over 100% import price restrictions, so they pay twice the price for graphics cards.  They won't mine bitcoin.  This is a fact.  And they know it.  So how do we get them to buy bitcoin, or offer services for bitcoin?  They can't buy the USD without explicitly explaining themselves to the authorities.  
EDIT:  Also, Bitcoin embassadorship win--&gt;  
@_date: 2012-11-04 09:51:08
sure, it won't be "shocking" in that sense, but it's still the best term to describe supply abruptly going down 50%.  
This year's BTC inflation was 25%--and price went up over 100%.  
In 2013, we'll have 11% new BTC.  Sure, some big holders may/will dump at some stages, but I think the price trend is well established.
@_date: 2012-11-15 12:51:05
They can't do much **right now**.  With the immense problems they have, something that has 100m market cap is a joke.  I think they'll start considering things after market cap surpasses 10B--which is quite a long run &amp; 100-fold gain for early adopters buying   
Consider this:
* White House Salary costs for presidential airlift squadron: $75,000,000
* White House Presidential plane fleet: $44,000,000
How is anyone going to talk about bitcoin to the highest levels of government and expect to be taken seriously?  Even the occasional FBI troll wondering in these quarters has to be worried about the USD and his own pension fund; any FBI guy smart enough to fully grasp bitcoin and the current scenario (Bernanke is printing 2 million per minute) is likely to at least consider getting some as a hedge. 
Moreover, any use of force to stop btc now will only attract more attention to it.  And remember that the world isn't the US.  The US is full of enemies: if the US prohibits bitcoin somehow, many of its enemies might feel tempted to use it, and its enemies have oil: Iran, Venezuela, Russia.

I can't "prove" it.  But look:
i) the same giant walls that appeared, sometimes on one side, sometimes on both, are still there;   
ii) if pirate's gonna run (likely), he will probably run with bitcoin and wait till things settle down.  (Otherwise the banking system will register, tax and report every single of his moves).  Would you run and tell the IRS (of your country) that you made all this cash through what?  So I think he runs with btc, not fiat.
This giant ratio of bitcoins offered/bitcoins wanted is simply ridiculous:  for the entire year I've followed this and these fake walls appeared when pirate's stash grow up:

Hell, Xerox had the mac in their hands and thought it was garbage.
Sadly, the guys from /. that understand the paranoid security involved in bitcoin, and that see that there is major monetary turmoil in the horizon, they've moved to bitcointalk and to r/bitcoin.

it would be awesome to see inflation rates &amp; population.  Belarus is running high-inflation.  Could have a great network effect there.  So is Argentina, but much higher population.  
I think that for full network effects to really kick in:  +miners, low population (i.e., imagine if Iceland's fishers started taking some btc), high informal economy (i.e., Greece), high levels of corruption, bank runs, high inflation, ability to export, and hopefully a supply chain with food security.

the problem is the velocity of money depends on people's confidence in the currency.  If there's a sudden loss of confidence, people rush away to physical assets.  
For example, luxury items are skyrocketing in Germany as people ditch the euro and buy 1m Euro cars, gold, jewllery.  This isn't under the control of governments.  They can only control how much they print.

You're absolutely right.  But it's not irrelevant for *people*.  Let's say we get some hotties on gonebitcoin, some hardcore programmers providing their service through bitcoin, and other services.  That's good for them; part of their savings can never go to a corralito or be printed at will.
Then, say, the newspapers everywhere start to report it.  Suddenly it becomes "good news" on how one nation is fighting financial repression.  Others will start to understand that financial repression &amp; massive inflation is coming.  And they (Greeks, for instance) just might brace themselves and prepare for it.

The part in which people are telling others what to do (refrain from buying) with so much intensity.

Thing is, I agree with not sending BFL (or MtGox or anything btc related) more than you can afford to lose.  But do I need to scream this to your face over and over?  Nope.

My analogy:
* HASH = barcode
* SALT = a "lottery card" that the miners are scratching in order to imagine how a barcode would change.
* Difficulty = The current maximum acceptable barcode number
Imagine you were on a supermarket the size of the universe.  Every product has a unique, different barcode, and these barcodes have their number printed on them.   
The miners are trying to imagine a product with a very very low number.   
This "diet coke" barcode is 129872936232391839720302092746932900.  
What if I change it to "pussycat coke?" 002038098323273986468753229.  
Is this new number smaller than the current difficulty?  If so, you have a block.  If not, try some other lottery ticket (salt).
Play around in blockchain.info and specially in   As you change the data (product), the barcodes change.  You have to find this rare barcode with a large number of zeroes on it.  In [block 198612]( for example, the hash (barcode) of *all the data inside the transactions PLUS the data in the lottery ticket* is 0000000000000520cfe6a4e30059fbcb313370b58877b6b04bff0108a20cfa22.

growing exponentially.  Now at ~30 users/day (doubling every 431 days).  I've been keeping track for a while and as Todamont mentioned, there is a non-linear tipping point where bitcoiners start mentioning our stuff everywhere and more people join and more people get involved and the network effect fully kicks in.  
I believe by 2014 bitcoin will have been multiple times on the front page of reddit, and constantly on the front page of @_date: 2012-11-09 06:01:41

Bro, first thing:  calm down. 
You will get them back.  
This has happened to me and I remembered the story of some other guy that went through this also.
I use the same (large) passwd for my different wallets, but this one wallet just wasn't working. 
Spent hours trying the same thing: variations on my usual passwd.  
Then I thought about a weird possibility: what if I hadn't used my usual passwd for this wallet?  
I had created the wallet in a rush.  I didn't crypt it with my usual strong passwd; I just used some retarded passwd like my passwd for reddit.  
**1. Try your retarded, easy passwd first!** 
You might have used them.
**2. Forget your assumptions about the passwd.** 
The only thing you know for a fact is that your strong 25-char passwd is wrong.  Other assumptions may also be also wrong. 
@_date: 2012-09-08 18:38:58

You're mistaken.  Hoarders make btc a store of value.  If nobody is using it as a store of value, prices would converge to zero--btc becomes paypal without the charge.
EDIT:  This is exactly why gold is a good store of value.  Many people hoard it.

I think you're into something big.  Creating a "stock market" for websites could leverage the quality of blogs enormously; instead of only looking at ad-driven monetization, this market valuation just might make them compete more rapidly with big media.   
One example:  Techcrunch used to be good.  But to get to a "liquidity event", it was sold.  Nowadays it's mostly a garbage blog.  You could be providing this "liquidity event" and the owners could still have most of the proceeds from ads--which would be an incentive for them to stay and keep the quality up.  At least this is what I grasp from your post.  
You *must* use bitcoin:  all other options could be blocked at a moment's notice if TPTB so declare.  
I think you have a wonderful idea.

My theory: pirate is buying (because he wants to pay or to escape).  He buys, price goes up, he puts up walls and sells to himself at a large discount (in another gox account), signaling that it's crashing, then he crashes the walls and buys more.  Rinse repeat.

Are you willing to post that "**9.5% of Bitcoiners mine Bitcoin according to a recent poll of r/bitcoinMining (1,034 readers) and r/bitcoin (11,299 readers)**", then?  
It's just as valid as your "poll".

Yes, it clearly has enormous potential.  Instead of those "donate" buttons, sites could have "Current Share Price: 0.0034btc" buttons.

check out mtgoxlive.com.  
People generally concentrate their bids/asks on [Shelling points]( like 12.5 or 12.4 (or immediately before or after, like 12.39999).  There are bids &amp; asks everywhere across the board, but these "walls" are generally concentrated in Shelling points.
Right now there's a 1500btc wall  and at least 6 others.  There are the usual huge walls at the Shelling points: right now  there are more than 2900btc.  
The way one friend of ours used to operate was to create huge fake walls and force people into a tiny trading band.  If you *need* to sell, and I bet some miners do, they're forced to sell at the band our friend had set.  Then suddenly the walls would collapse one way or another, and an immense buy/sell order would wipe out *everything* instantaneously.  
I don't really care about this, [I didn't put any money on this guy anyway]( but I'm really curious to find out whether he's trading on mtgox, btc-e, etc, now with "other people's *stolen* money".

Yes and no.  
Yes, they are created with each new block.  But that takes an enormous amount of work, and is part of what makes the system honest.  
No, essentially because this phrase is generally meant to refer to money created without any work, "out of thin air".  It doesn't take any work for central banks to create new money--millions, billions, or trillions, they all take the same amount of work for a central banker.

on a broad enough definition of stolen, I agree with you.  Except there were HUGE warnings EVERYWHERE that people were lighting cigarrettes at the Hindenburg, and nobody heard.   
I guess the intensity of the thrill of easy money must be ENORMOUSLY addictive.  The idea of quadrupling your money in 20 weeks is way too seductive.

market's about to go crazy bullish
@_date: 2012-09-09 20:27:29
This will drive the price crazy.  I think an acute drop in the first 48 hours, followed by an even higher explosion, leading to unthinkable prices.  
Given that you can run a whole economy in bitcoin, if you think only in terms of btc price, the best thing going for it is prohibition.  
Prohibition might even subvert the political and judicial systems, if an Al Capone emerges.

Or exactly like there was nothing to support wikipedia becoming the world's premier enciclopedia.

don't forget to mention the potential for future valuation, at least in passing:  
@_date: 2012-09-13 01:53:05
My exit strategy is basically: IF btc grows 10-fold, recover my bernankes (selling something like 10%).  Keep the rest until 2017, or a rainy day.  
Bitcoin is a longshot asymmetric bet. It's binary.  It's going to explode.  Either it explodes on our faces or it explodes in the globe.  
Barring a catastrophic protocol failure, I can't see any way that it won't explode, like linux did in servers and cell phones, or wikipedia.  
The time to buy is now, when authoritarian-leaning figures are ignoring or laughing at it: "100m usd??  Call me back when it's 10B!".  
When it gets to 10B, and it will, we've gained around 100x.
@_date: 2012-08-27 20:56:13

"The vast majority of people..." How do we know what they're thinking?  What are they saying to each other?  What will they be saying to each other next Sunday after church?  WE CANNOT KNOW.  No government or central bank can control that.  
And this theory that money shouldn't be a store of value?  Go to a country in hyperinflation (Argentina and Iran are prime candidates for the next 12 months), watch the social fabric collapse, watch middle class secretaries selling their bodies at the end of the month, watch empty supermarket shelves, and after you see how the middle class is wiped out in a couple of years, maybe you'll think again.  I doubt it, but maybe you'll reconsider.

300+ results in books, buddy:
@_date: 2012-10-16 00:06:05
My dream procedure is:
* create very small truecrypt volume, insert tax files in the main volume, wallet.dat (encrypted with Password A1) in hidden volume. (Volume is encrypted with password A2, hidden volume with A1+A2+hash(A1+A2)).  
* Now we have a small file (150k?) with "random data". I want to insert this file, which looks strange and interesting to an attacker, "hmmm... interesting... random data...?".  
* Get a large mp3 file (4MB+). Insert the "noise" there, if possible using another password, like hash(A1+A2+hash(A1+A2)).  
* Insert the file in **all** songs in a very popular just released album you ripped from a newly bought CD on 8:00AM the launch day, upload to the high seas, se3d for a long time (10 months+), so that these precise files start to become widely distributed all over. Your private keys are now everywhere, and your files are seen by the totalitarians out there as "normal" (same hashes as lots of other "users").
* Create 10+ backup copies in pendrives; have one everywhere you frequently go. Create copies in CDs, give it to friends and family. Use cloud services (and check whether they change the file for some reason or other).
**Yes, it's paranoid**. But it's unbreakable enough to me.  If you're saving some btc for the 2016's block reward halving, it's worth it.  And the beauty of this thing is that it everything can be automated.
@_date: 2012-09-12 21:25:08

I hope the first idiot nation prohibits it: 
* suddenly, the whole world is exposed to it.  (Nobody knows it exists.) 
* the idiot-nation's enemies will probably start accepting it.  Imagine what it would do to price if Iran started taking btc for oil.  
* the idiot-nation will have to deal with a stronger version of Al Capone, as criminals flock to it and start corrupting law enforcement, killing judges, etc.  
 
To prohibit bitcoin is a major mistake.
At any rate, it's a matter of time before the first too big to fail fails (Santander?  JP Morgan? etc.)  Give it some years.  Then everybody understands.
