blockchain.info has some issue with new blocks. This is most likely a bug in there custom code to read blocks. Once its resolved it should catch up again.
They stopped updating at 288776, current block is 288788.
Other sites like  still update.

Andreas talks about the economy and its desolate state, he does not make an argument why Bitcoins collapse is less likely than the collapse of the US Dollar or any other asset.
as for the second link:
After again talking about the general economic situation today, we jump to:


So Polycephal_Lee believes Bitcoin is massively more competent at serving our monetary and financial needs.
I was looking for some data, its nice to believe and all but its not a good argument.

It heavily depends on a non-reversible payment processor.  But who offers that service?

But what makes you think that the possibility that Bitcoin will collapse is lower than the possibility of any other asset?
Do you just believe that or you have some data for your claim?

I would feel better if there was a free monthly volume, lets say 1000 €. Only after a transaction volume above 1000 € the 19,90€ are charged. That way per transaction costs really are &lt; 2% and cheaper than credit cards.
A fixed monthly fee is more risky if you don't have enough bitcoin paying customers.
Services like  charge 2.75% for credit card and 0.95% for EC card payments with no monthly costs, for these merchant solutions to compete they have to be cheaper or offer other significant advantages.

Not sure what country you are talking about when you mention low income workers.
Xapo is not available in the US. In most countries in Europe its free to open a bank account. In some Asian countries I know people without bank accounts. They get played in cash and have to pay most things in cash. A Xapo Card does not help nor does a bank account, that's why they don't have one.
Xapo is a [MY Choice]( prepaid credit card: [Xapo Debit Card Review](
With Xapo as with any other MY Choice prepaid credit card: When you open a Card Account, we will ask you for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to reasonably identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents at any time.

Let me rephrase it, Argentina released those bonds under New York Law in order to get someone to buy them. They could have release bonds under Argentinian law and there would not be the current problem. Bitcoin would not change anything.

There is no need for the entire network to store all data currently in the blockchain. If only a small number of nodes keep the data, its still possible to retrieve it and validate it against the blockchain. So as long as a small number of people is interested in the data it will be around.

Possibly with low yearly limit without verification($250), as its the case with prepaid master cards or BIT-X Bitcoin Debit Card (

But so far not a single bitUSD &lt;&gt; USD exchange exist and its not clear there ever will or what kind of fees they will charge. BitShares does not solve the problem of converting between Bitcoin and Dollars. For that you need an exchange. BitShares just adds another layer of uncertainty without adding anything really.

no they could not. on the same logic they could just pay them in another country. the fact that those bonds are under new york state jurisdiction requires them to comply with new york law. payment methods are irrelevant.

I find it strange how that they hide the fees and limits. Like the daily limit is under a heading "No Limits" - Followed by a limit. That makes it look like a joke to me - will stay away from it.
Anyone knows how they come up with the exchange rate? Could not find it on the site.
There current exchange rate listed on the page is 1 btc = 210 usd vs 1 btc = 215 on 
That's another 2-3% hidden transaction fee.

In ncsakira's example this is all automated. I just wanted to point out that payment is the problem that takes the least amount of work when it comes to renting out apartments and you want escrow and buyer/seller verification or rating. Cleaning up and checking if things are in order still require human involvement. Airbnb offers escrow, rating and conflict resolution. Automating the door will not remove that part. Moving the payment into your key lock does not help at all.

so you are saying its not really a protocol, but just an analogy? sorry but in that case I fail to see the point of that analogy.
Blockchain will never be like TCP/IP, just repeating it does not make it true. TCP/IP is a specification not a piece of software. current blockchain implementations are more like database servers, except there is not even an idea of SQL or other shared interface on top that would allow you to write 'blockchain applications' on top of any underlying blockchain implementation.

Lost in abstractions, just another fluff article.
Putting Blockchain on the protocol level in the stack is just stupid. The rest on that list are protocols not concepts. There is no standard 'Blockchain' protocol called Blockchain.

The first version of the Bitmarkets client is configured to use a 1-1 deposit/price ratio. So for the sale of an item costing X, the buyer would put up 2X (1X for payment and 1X for deposit) and the seller 1X so a total of 3X would be locked in escrow. 
Got a link to that discussion on BCT, would like to read up on how it is logically broken as it is not intuitively obvious.
