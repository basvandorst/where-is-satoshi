Looks like people are dumpling trx for BTC on Binance. Also the price is 21k on a Korean exchange

It's not a good idea either, you'll get burned trying to time this market

Those coins are yours, do something good with the money. Help friends and family or a charity. Or just keep holding!

Champ! I've listened to a lot of rogan podcasts can't believe I've missed all of these!

Don't dwell on it, thousands of people are in your same position. At least you didn't buy a $160million pizza.

Heh, one of them was me. I've had bitcoins for a while now but I thought I'd give their wallet a go. I'm a fan, would recommend.

@_date: 2017-12-09 03:20:57
It'll be pure look if that happens.

@_date: 2017-12-30 05:26:17

There was a post a couple of hours ago saying buying and selling would be down for a couple of hours. So it should be back up soon

I said the same thing at the start of the year when I checked the price. "fuck $1000!? should have jump in when it was $200, -_- missed the boat on this one" 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:46:26
Not everyone watches the news, I was all over bitcoin a few years back. I randomly checked it at the start of this year and literally didn't hear about it again until I saw the bitcoin on a roller-coaster hit r/all when it was climbing to 5k. This is completely plausible.

What independent reserve? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:00:48
