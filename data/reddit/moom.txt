I am not a tax professional or a lawyer.  My advice should not be considered trustworthy.
Generally speaking, you can transfer an asset from one institution (or your pocket) to another without incurring tax.

That's fantastic.

I'm sorry, it's long gone from my point of view.  I've been randomly going through a bunch of bitcoin-related posts since seeing it, and I no longer remember it specifically.

I bought a small amount of Bitcoin in order to save money on a specific product that I wanted, which was offering a large discount (relative to USD) if paid in Bitcoin.  At the same time, I purchased a bit extra in order to easily take advantage of any other such deals which might come up.  
It's not the case that I have "no clue at all" about it.  I investigated it as far as seemed necessary for my purposes.  If you think that only people who obsessively follow the politics and technical details of Bitcoin should use it, frankly, I don't think Bitcoin would get very far with that idea.

I wouldn't hold my breath.  I've been waiting *YEARS* for them to implement Dogecoin!

Oh, I'm sure we'll see a Bйщ yet.

I don't know much about them in general, and essentially nothing about the vast majority of them specifically, but when I look at [CryptoCurrency Market Cap]( and see that there are like literally a thousand of these things, hundreds of which supposedly have seven or more digit market caps, I can't help but imagine that for most of these, the only "value" is created is by one big circlejerk of obsessed fanatics saying "OMG look at SpaceBuks price, I gotta sell my HerbieCoin for SpaceBuks!"
I mean, really, for most of these things, can I actually *use* them anywhere? Other than on some exchange to buy *other kinds* of these things?
To be clear, I'm not specifically asking about the ones you mention; just speaking generally.

No way.  As I've said elsewhere, finger.  Finger was more than a decade before Gopher, and I assure you we thought of our finger plans in terms of what is now known as "home pages".

I'm guessing I'm supposed to start the first sentence with "I'm guessing".  [Finger]( preceded Usenet by years.
Word up, my finger plan was like totally radical, dude.  Bitchin' to the max.  Or, as I believe the youth are inclined to say these days, "the bee's knees".  "Gimme five bees for a nickel", you'd say.

Several people have told you you shouldn't, or at least that there's no benefit to doing it, and I saw a couple explanations of why, but I thought it might help to give an example:
Let's imagine that those coins in your safe deposit box are not legally owned by you; you're just holding them there for your Great Aunt Petunia.  Great Aunt Petunia is a big Bitcoin enthusiast, but she doesn't have a safe deposit box, or anywhere else really good to store her hard wallet, so you're helping her out with that.
Great Aunt Petunia may then tell you "I want you to send my Bitcoin to my software wallet with such-and-such an address".  If she then receives that Bitcoin from you, she knows, or at least has a good suspicion, that you did not illegally spend her Bitcoin without having told her.
That's what's being "proven".  The entity physically controlling the Bitcoin (you, or an exchange) proves to the entity legally owning the Bitcoin (Great Aunt Petunia, or a customer of the exchange) that they have not illegally spent the your Bitcoin.
But if you're the holder and you're also the owner, what are you proving? To whom?
