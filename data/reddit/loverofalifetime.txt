EXCELLENT answer man.  Thank you!

Here is the announcement directly from ViaBTC

just relaxed dude..wtf?!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:43:24
Its called...Yodling, because you have to sing a song while you do :-D
Yodl Hodl, Yodl Hodl, Yodl Hodl, hee hoo!

Use miningpoolhub **NOT** Nicehash.  They just got hacked for $60 million and NO ONE has gotten a dime back from it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:29:50
They liquidated them **AFTER** purchasing them with their "funny money" USDT...total scam and they needed to add some more dollars to back those USDT.... Avoid at all cost.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:47:07
Yes!  Don't keep your money on exchange longer than you have to.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:41:40
Not true! Amazon was AMAZING and putting barnes and noble out of business when it was just selling books.  Lived it and saw it!
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:28:11
That's a dumbass answer.  Paypal charges nothing! Duh
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:26:19
Bear compared to what?  $20,000 price peak, I guess but against 2017 13,000% gain, I don't think so.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:24:20
Yes your crazy OP.  I would buy Monero or Ethereum...Bitcoin is in limbo until they get the Lightning Network in place and under attack as a payment solution due to the small block size, slow transactions and better solutions coming online like (Hyperledger, Omisego)
Just giving you the facts man and keep some in Fiat for taxes, can't forget those.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:32:51
Your*******! Clear enough for you...2019 I'll be **STILL** laughing in your face about dinosaur slowness of the bitcoin block chain *******
And just because you don't like Monero or Ethereum doesn't mean what I said isn't true or the facts!
Fuck off yourself!
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:44:37
That's because it was at $20,000 3 weeks ago!
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:34:24
I'm starting to think that as well (Tx fee being the downfall of Bitcoin).
Even with lightning network (Which I am still trying to digest in bite-size morsels) may not alleviate the underlying higher transaction fees.
Also, bitcoin has lost 36% of its market share to other coins in the last year!  That's significant.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:12:50
Yes it does say we need a 134mb block size (I am almost done reading it, old info though)
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:38:30
NO he's not!
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:13:43
True! Its become an absolute scam! (Charging for INCOMING transaction which is an output and has no network fee.)
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:38:51
Coinbase and other exchanges  may be able to  do that but that's why you need  to hold your own private keys.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:10:55
**If** and that's a BIG if this happens I can foresee a MASSIVE drop in difficulty, price fluctuation and FUD (people trying to cloud the issue for their own benefit) since this put a large amount of hashing power out of business.  (30%+ or more)
Well see but if you don't live there, Mine on!
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:16:15
I **DEFINITELY** agree with you about the block size.  It needs to be 134mb as originally proposed.
1mb or 2mb...not even CLOSE to cutting it!
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:23:46
What this reminds of is old computers...1mb block is still useful and will play that new game but just not very well (and maybe not at all!)
The 1mb block size is getting dated by the day....freaking tx fee are only getting worse
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:52:20
I would be if I had known about it. 
Only thing I ever heard about bitcoin prior to this was Mt. Gox how an exchange got hacked....couldn't comprehend it so I bypassed on it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:13:09
And that's on TOP  of what it cost to send from an external wallet (If that is what you did)...Insanity!
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:27:39
I **DEFINITELY** have a problem with Tether.  Their October 2017 "Audit" wasn't even a full audit, just a consultancy.  
It is a clever trick, I just don't understand how anybody is falling for it.  Its (unregulated) Fiat on top of
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:14:03
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:30:13
But its not a political argument at this point. Its economic.  Bitcoin has lost over 60% of its market share to alt-coins since late 2016.  
People are moving away from now more than ever because of these damn fees.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:25:55
Yeah I remember reading this and being lulled to sleep by it until I realized it only benefited the huge miners enjoying the increasingly higher transactions fees.
If the developers aren't careful they are going to be killing off the Golden Goose due to greed....I see it!

Use a translator or Chrome to read. Interesting and from a Official Chinese News agency
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:53:29
how about explaining it instead of giving a damn dumbass answer like, uh goggle!
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:27:42
Why do you care STFU and sell if you are so worried!!  Its not like anyone (but  a few) have the power to drive down prices anyone so **STOP** adding to the bullshit!
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:03:05
Don't listen to the negativity.  This is the internet and its overwhelmed with noise!  I would suggest you get into mining if you can afford it and become a part of the ecosystem even more (If you are not already mining)
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:56:04
666 upvote..A strange coincidence
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:10:19
Unfortunately you are right for the moment at least spending wise.  Saving-wise, HODL or probably better yet, exchange for Ethereum and THEN HODL.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:31:00
Great post.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:04:50
Not a life of tranquility is it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:22
As long as you don't use NiceHash!  Dammit!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:53
Don't ever believe that!! Mine and keep on mining!!!!! (I'm serious).  Buy (If you can afford, Antminer S4 to start, but start!)
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:36:28
Opps :-(   (That's why I mine, ONLY!)
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:53:55
You use Stop-Loss and get out at the best available price to close the Short. 
Its done everyday.
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:13:39
Go Playa Go Playa
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:57:20
Tell me who you **HODL**in'?????
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:02:29
Yeah right!
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:59:16
That was Fucking unhelpful for the OP..sheez!
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:46:51
How do you know if he's a holder or not?? Where do you get off accusing someone of not being something when you don't even know him personally?
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:33:22
My thought exactly.  A better benchmark would be btc to gold
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:22:07
You must be******* dude..sheez!  or don't understand how Bitcoin mining works  Either that was DUMB statement..."2x is doomed"  Ridiculous!
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:49:57
Your right.  Came to the same conclusion sitting here thinking about Segwit2x.  It's going to happen because all of the big  mining pools are signaling for it... that's why bitcoin sucks.
The idea of a decentralized coin (Like the U.S. constitution) is a propagated fantasy.  Reality says with events like this.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:25:45
Answer, YES!
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:26:39
Miners actually do the work of creating new bitcoins.  Also when someone conducts a transaction in bitcoins, miners are the ones that select when that transaction will be processed based on the size of the transaction fee that is attached to the transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:53:30
Yes (Make sure you do it offline, using linux livecd as OS)
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:42:54
That was an unnecasarily stupid comment dude ..sheez/!! Fudkdude
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:46:58
Sorry to hear that man... :(
(and I would NEVER laugh at you, I can't imagine how you are feeling)
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:23:37
Language dude, What the F**!! @_date: 2019-05-23 15:19:20
what the hell you talking about??  He had $5,000 not $5 dollars..sheez and why are getting on the guy about such a Stupid point anyway??
