I think btc are a great thing but if something better comes along I wouldnt have a problem using it.

I was having a tough time explaining bitcoin in under a minute at lunch yesterday. I fell back on drugs, when it came to "what can you buy with it". Aside from that you can also buy tech stuff and things with "bitcoin" printed on them. And Alpaca socks. Can't forget those.

After concerns brought up about DeepBit's domination of the "mining market" it is worth comparing other pools. As unscientific as it is, what are people's personal experience with various pools? Anyone wanna advocate solo mining?
@_date: 2011-06-11 04:45:43
Pardon me, but this sounds a little funky. I guess the world could always use another mining pool but I don't know how many serious miners or investors are looking to buy "lotto tickets" withe their shares. If a mine wants to ask for a percentage, that's one thing to play into some sort of game seems cheap. Maybe it has it's place.
@_date: 2011-06-16 01:58:24
mtgox doesn't sell anything, they facilitate the exchange of currency. They collect a small fee from that transaction, and that's it.
  The fearmongers have already spoken out against it, as they believe that its already being used to launder money. As people start to untighten their wallets and people start spending bitcoins in exchange for goods and services that are perfectly benign, the scrutiny will die down.
I think the best argument for bitcoin that people can agree with is its no-bullshit commerce.

I'm inclined to agree with the idea that people aren't interested in payin *for* music. But I am willing to pay for talented people to continue to make music.
Quick example, I discovered an artist called Pretty Lights. He gives his music away on his website and simply asks people to not be dicks and support his ability to keep putting out tunes. I sent him $20. If I like your stuff, I'll support you. Instead of buying 3 or 4 albums a month, I now try to support 3 or 4 people (or small groups/organizations) a month. Hopefully Bitcoin can drive that kind of economy going forward.
@_date: 2011-05-20 19:47:42
At this point I would suggest joining a pool. They all have slightly different criteria. I joined up with one that offers either bigger payouts or more steady coin income (I opted for slow and steady). I started it last night and this morning woke up to .002 coins. that's more than the first 48 hours of solo GPU mining (which generated nothing, of course).
/I should also mention that the pool i'm in (and I believe others) has a 'cash out' feature where you earn a certain share amount and once it hits your preset limit (say 10 BTC) it actually sends you the coins. This helps you manage paying transaction fees.
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:50:44
I was all about gilding up a stash of coins but when the market popped up to 30 and a measly 3 coins was $90 I cashed out. Free money? Do want.
@_date: 2011-07-28 05:28:43
probably because bitcoin is a whole other currency, rather than merely a means of transfering USD from your bank account. Bitcoin doesn't require a lot of "build out" for some random person somewhere with a computer and an internet connection to start mining/trading. Granted, currency conversion can be a pain, but Bitcoin itself doesn't really care about that.
@_date: 2011-06-09 11:54:13
Trade hill also accepts dwolla. Their terms seem fairly similar to mtgox. Like the layout. I may try this later

Totally agree I'd be more interested in converting some dollars to btc if there was more stuff I wanted to buy with them.
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:29:04
If I could frame this argument a year from now:
Bitcoins are what you use when you check that little "B" button next to the purchase box on a website. Instead of sending US dollars attached to a credit card or bank account, you send bitcoins- a separate currency- almost as easily as handing cash to a cashier. Bitcoins have the same value the world over, so after you have your bitcoins, you can spend them anywhere that takes them and there is no transaction fee and no other identifying information is attached to the payment.
If you receive bitcoins, they are yours, and are stored on a computer that you control. Not in a bank, or account that can get frozen or blocked. You can backup your bitcoins (technically wallet) to a server, but that's not required. The point is that it takes a lot of the BS and middlemen out of purchasing and puts you in complete control of your money online.
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:42:45

Agreed a shallow market like trade hill is not a good indicator, and the time period is not significantly long to really ascertain much. Fortunately the market seems to float around $13 to $14. I'm quite happy to mine a little on the side and save up.

Hey, this is what we have to deal with. At a certain point you either believe in the premise (or promise) of bitcoins or you don't. I think as more people start to understand or support it, they'll come around. The market nonsense and mining rush have kind of overshadowed some of it.
 There's tons of BS out there at the moment.

I'm a little surprised dwolla hasn't gotten interested in offering a bitcoin payment option. The dwolla account itself is not totally anonymous, but the dwolla system seems ready made to incorporate a bitcoin payment option.

Wow, that article is useless. I don't see how that would either interest someone or dissuade someone. The article feels like "ok, so this is kind of popular now... and I don't get it and I think its dumb, so here's my half-assed article. Can I get paid now?"
@_date: 2011-07-21 14:34:32
Also at this point in btc, good coverage depends on how much of an interest the reporter covering it has interest. I'm willing to bet that dismissive and poorly researched articles come from lazy journalists with editors don't really care about the content of the article (laziness is rampant in journalism, especially as they are forced to do with less in the newsroom).
Though I will acknowledge that politics is another big factor.
@_date: 2011-06-19 14:45:20
I like this approach as it tries to overcome the crazy moves of the day to day market. This kind of mindset should help to stabilize commerce and hopefully drive more adoption of bitcoin as a "real" currency in its own right.
@_date: 2011-08-07 21:01:58
That's pretty much the analogy I use when giving more in depth information on bitcoin. The only issue is that with gold people already go "of course gold is valuable, its gold!" with BTC they have to make a more active assumption that it has value.
@_date: 2011-05-31 04:48:36
I was just thinking the same thing today. I've been kicking around ideas for how I could earn bitcoins and not just mine them. Things that are generally taboo are probably one of the great first markets.
I'm just afraid that it will mark bitcoins as "dirty" and dissuade other businesses from adopting the currency.
@_date: 2011-06-20 22:03:42
The recurring theme I've seen over yesterday and today is "MtGox took a shit, BITCOIN MUST BE DOOMED!" Did they say that stocks were doomed when the market took a shit? Did they say Japan was doomed in the late 90s when they're massive recession hit? (actually, they did say that just to sow FUD)-but the point is that the underlying nature of bitcoin is still sound. Yes, some people have gotten ripped off and the system has been abused, just like any financial market could be abused, but that doesn't make the USD a less valid currency.
I guess people see what they want to see in this. Its going to be a blip in a few months. I'm not predicting bitcoin to explode like it did again, in fact I'd be quite happy if it didn't, but obviously some people (most of whom were antagonistic to the *idea* of Bitcoin) have decided that the bitcoin revolution is over.
@_date: 2011-06-14 02:33:30
It's still a little early to say the price has stabilized. Remember that the price didn't even break $10 up until last month. Things are still muddled and it would be nice to see that these coins might actually get spent or utilized in some constructive way. I don't like the idea that some cartel or gang plunged into the market just to clean their bills.
@_date: 2011-07-27 03:02:23
This sucks because its some crappy users mucking up the system. I've had a number of simple and easy transactions with Dwolla, and I did like using them. The fact that they are ignoring this issue is very disappointing since in their website they pride themselves on being "safer than credit cards" while also being (relatively) anonymous. MtGox hasn't had any issues, and yet they seem like they would have been better/bigger targets.
@_date: 2011-05-27 00:19:33
More details, please. Did you actually make USD or BTC?
@_date: 2011-06-20 19:50:42
that is basically what the notice said on Tradehill's site "we're down, haven't had any issues but we're shutting down to stave off panic selling and to allow any of our customers who were using the same information for login with Tradehill to change their passwords."
@_date: 2011-06-13 11:43:32
In my experience people really only care about "why" they should use bitcoin. Bitcoin is well outside the realm of need on a day to day basis for most people.
Im not trying to put bitcoin down, i think its revolutionary. But I have a much easier time explaining dwolla just because it solves something of a real problem for many people compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-08-24 21:10:48
Without even visiting that site it sounds like the most casual mining pool ever. If you don't mind creating an account you can hook into mtred, (checkout r/mtred). Payouts have been pretty good for me and i'm very similar in mining to OP. 
@_date: 2011-08-03 18:26:44
I don't know if he's making that statement based on any actual information. But it's no secret that the bitcoin market is very shallow and a big mover could easily manipulate the market.
I'm staying the course, will keep my casual mining and might even buy some more as this dip hits.

I use a thing called GUIminer. it looks very similar to the Bitcoin app itself. It allows you to connect to one of the many mining pools, but also you can mine solo as well.
Depending on your GPU you may need to update your drivers as well.
@_date: 2011-05-26 22:59:49
From my rather basic understanding, reading Satoshi's whitepaper and Bitcoin's wikipedia entry. The block production rate, and its increasing difficulty, are a feature of the bitcoin system itself. Each block's hash is subsequently more complex, so the first person to generate a valid hash (as confirmed by the network) creates the next block and subsequently any hashes created that are beneath that threshold of complexity/length are invalid. 
@_date: 2011-08-12 00:35:05

The shitty thing is that he obviously didn't really want the bitcoins, he wanted to convert to US dollars (presumably when the value of BTC goes up, so he makes more). If he wanted BTC, he should stick to using BTC and not worry about converting it. If I take money in USD but really want British pounds, why should it be of any concern to a third party when I have to pay for the exchange service? That's a bad deal for bitcoins, and really kind of defeats the purpose.
@_date: 2011-06-14 01:38:59
This is what is so frustrating about dwolla and also what I kind of like about it. The crime in the post is very possible but the amount of "lead time" you would need on your victim is pretty long. Also assuming that btw maintains it's value.

The use of BTC in "developing nations" is interesting. As those places get more and more of their populations online with mobile phones, BTC may be a relatively easy way to conduct simple business.
I also like BTC being the online equivalent of cash, as compared to credit cards. I wouldn't have a problem giving my kid an allotment of bitcoins, just like I wouldn't have a problem giving my kid $20 as an allowance. The fact that its anonymous would be an advantage to concerned parents.
Obviously I can think of a number of ways to have people use bitcoins. What matters currently is that businesses have to start wanting to accept bitcoins. I think that's a tougher sell.

Here's what I got out of it. They are basically trying to turn bitcoin into any other currency with regulated exchanges. What will happen is that only institutional investors will participate in the exchanges and artificially manipulate the price on this young currency. Not to mention that bringing bitcoin or the exchanges under tightened control by any government will break its uniquely global characteristics.
Bitcoin is a great experiment and turning it into "just another currency" would seriously impede it's adoption by average users.

No security solution will be 100% foolproof/crackproof. This at least takes away some of the user unfriendliness of bitcoin best practices. I'd much rather have every user somewhat protected than have people getting burned because they aren't tech savvy enough.

Hopefully, once it comes along, normal users won't really need to worry about setting up accounts with the exchanges and will just use bitcoin's straight off, so after an initial investment, they would be off and running.

Dwolla to Dwolla is very fast. I can send my buddies a couple bucks with no problem. The slow down comes from either getting money into or out of Dwolla and the time it takes for whatever exchange to see that your payment was deposited into their dwolla (or they may immediately try to get it transferred into their actual bank account which would also add time. but that way they know they actually have the money). In short, there are a lot more steps to Dwolla than they let on besides the 'internal' portion that is really quite fast and convenient.

It's not a good idea to keep all your funds in one place- especially given that Coinbase doesn't insure your account like a bank would.
There is also the issue of not holding your wallet's private key, but let's just assume (however dangerous that may be) that Coinbase is a good and upstanding company.
You can also use a bitcoin client like multibit to store and move your coins around.
A paper wallet with copies that are stored carefully that only you know about with a passcode or phrase is probably the most secure way to handle any sizeable number of coins unless you're in the process of transacting/exchanging them.

Wow, that was bad. Like "reddit comment"-bad.

online comics. Really hope Comixology smells the coffee (and can get out from under Apple's shadow).

There's nothing stopping someone- though there is a notification sent to the sender if you use the screen capture feature. There are also apps that work to circumvent this detection. You can find them in the App store pretty readily.

Yeah. I've never heard of this site. A lot of comedians have been doing work with Chill.com. They don't take bitcoin. But they seem pretty cool if you've got an independent film to sell.
