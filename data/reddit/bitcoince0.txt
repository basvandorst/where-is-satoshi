as long as the password has more than 5 characters, there is almost no chance if he wants to bruteforce the wallet.
see here: 
Some just copy paste the seed on the first time they start electrum, that is how things like this can happen.
@_date: 2014-04-24 08:13:15
this is the way, look at that ruby script. From your pretty good guess it tries combinations like adding one character, deleting one character, replace one character ... and so on. It tries all kind of typos and this is way faster as there are not so many possibilities.

Regarding your comment on my 8 cent tip on I'm still not sure whether you are trolling me or trying to insult me with your generosity or you just like being insulted by me or saying sorry for insulting me indirectly or you show me that I can receive large tips without contributing anything. Very confusing but I like the outcome. :D I'll definitely buy a copy of Trading Places, thanks for reminding me of this great movie which I loved to watch when I was a kid.

but you are aware that 8 decimal points is not the maximum? There is no reason why we have exactly 8 zeros behind the decimal. With consensus we could add 8 more zeros. There is no reason or rule why we now have the decimal point at 1.00000000 or if we put the decimal point at 1000000.00 or 1000000000000.00000
But there is in fact a reason to switch to a system many people over the world are used to and that would be .00 for now. The question is where do we set the decimal point that we don't have the same problem in the "near term".
@_date: 2014-04-11 23:21:51
The difficulty is independent from functionality, and so the power consumption. (There is a limit to the transactions (7tx/s) for now but it is a protocol issue)

That's wrong. If you buy and sell within a year you have to pay "Spekulationssteuer" which is about 25% (+5.5% Solidaritätszuschlag) of your profits. So in Germany you have to buy and hold for at least 12 months to evade this tax or stay below an amount of 600Euro/year.

In the bitcointalk forums you can find a thread with ruby scripts to find your password for the electrum wallet. (you have to know some details about the wallet passphrase)

Transfer the wallet from your phone to a electrum client on your PC then run this ruby script with your best guess. As you managed to install electrum on your phone I guess you are a bit tech savvy. :D

Ok another try, this topic is interesting.
Quote from PDF link ( :
"Security researcher Dan Kaminsky has performed an analysis of the Bitcoin
system, investigating identity leakage at the TCP/IP layer. He found that by
opening a connection to all public peers in the network at once, he could map
IP addresses to Bitcoin public-keys, working from the assumption that “the
first node to inform you of a transaction is the source of it. . . [this is] more or
less true, and absolutely over time” [16]. Using this approach it is possible to
map public-keys to IP addresses unless users are using an anonymising proxy
technology such as TOR."
So he needs to run a full node -&gt; sends you a test transaction -&gt;  you open a connection to all public peers in the network at once -&gt; you find the IP that broadcasted -&gt; at the same time you video chat with him, letting him do funny things to proof it is live -&gt; compare IPs
Or much easier:
Video chat -&gt; live-signing of his key with message of your choice (notice: don't give him the time and chance to communicate with "bad actor")-&gt; tada :D
Still slight chances to betray you( remote connection from "bad actor" to computer of "good actor")... damn :D

Even with a decline in value of more than 50%, people still think bitcoin is very expensive. You always have to tell them that it is divisible and you can buy smaller units. Watch their face if you send them 10$ worth of bitcoin as a gift. A tiny amount like 0.024 BTC just doesn't feel the same. We don't see much value in tiny amounts it's basic psychology. There would be much benefit from a one time change that lasts for many years. Bitcoin is fighting on many frontiers and people already have to over-think their definition of money. Why do we have to make this step even more difficult?

Can't find a way without the possibility to trick the system. A third party verifying your "good actor" and his online wallet on their page? But who tells you where the coins came from and that they are not stolen somewhere along the chain? 
This is it:
- A third party verifying your "good actor" and only accepts freshly mined coins for deposit to their online wallet. :D

Simple explanation: Because all keypairs already exist and you calculate one out of this large pool. There are so many possibilities that it is very very very very unlikely someone else generates the same keypair.

This is a right you of course have. The problem is the law enforcement agencies will typically not work such cases, ask them if you don't believe it.
The cardholders are afforded certain rights under Federal laws. If you sue them it will be costly, especially since venue (where the correct jurisdiction is for the case) is ill defined in Internet transactions. Even if you do win you still need to collect."

The Mexican says, "I wish that all my Mexican brethren and me could be transported back to our native homeland and we could all be happy there.'
Poof! The Mexican disappears. The genie turns to the African American. "And what is your wish?"
"I wish that all my African brothers and I can all go back to our motherland and be happy and free."
Poof! The black guy disappears. The genie turns to the white guy. "And what is your wish?"
The white guy looks thoughful. "Are you telling me that all the s****s and blacks are gone from America?"
The genie nods. "Oh, in that case then, I'll have a coke."

After consulting a dictonary... :D
I was more interested how to identify someone through the internet. Cryptography can do a lot of things but does not proof that there is not a tricky identity thief behind the signed messages. An IP wouldn't solve it as we don't have the data of ownership from his ISP (a Wlan hack would be as well possible). The law of my country would at least make it possible to sue the person that owns the IP, as he is responsible for everything that happened through this IP.
I hope we never need to watch out for tainted coins this would be a disaster.

Where to set the decimal point is pure speculation on future prices. It is indeed a deflationary currency long-term but it is not guarantied that we come to that point as demand influences the price as well. I just wanted to make clear that there is no specific reason or rule where the decimal point or no decimal point HAS to be. The rest is purely democratic and the consensus will show what we choose.

what about a bootable OS with a Lightweight Bitcoin Client installed(+1 for backup). Blockchain account is not cold storage and the flash drive version isn't either. But it is much saver, you have the control of your coins and it is fast accesible (in contrast to real cold storage like a paper wallet) .

You guys are awesome +1000. Great feature and a step into the right direction. I still don't like your design, but this is a minor flaw for now.  :D

came here to say this. My guess is that he is ignoring it on purpose in order to advertise his centralized shitcoin. At least we found one company with an incentive to spread FUD and pay the trolls. ;)

I'm not sure if every single of these problems could have been avoided as they still have to e.g. prevent money laundering, verify your age.
But I agree that the online casino industry would benefit from bitcoin due less chargebacks and make these steps easier without that much paperwork. (You wouldn't need Point 4 and 5)
