I have $0.0044 Canadian in my account, but I can't withdraw it (nor is there no point) because it's way below the minimum.

It was tied to CA Virtex when I used it last. I actually used it from some quick arb between it and VOS (rip) on a 1000$ transaction as a proof of concept for someone.

It's saying that the real.money is made in the run-up ie buying when it's a rumour and selling once it's confirmed by the news.

Holy shit I was actually crying from laughter. Amazing

 Relatively cool since it trades in the CSV and FSE/OTCQB pair, it means it is eligible for tax sheltered accounts in Canada. Not that I would buy any though.
