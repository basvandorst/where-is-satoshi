Yes I think that's correct. It's just an eventuality that more bitcoins will be mined. If less people mined then the hash rate and thus difficulty would decrease eventually.
There's actually a potential problem that if enough miners stopped at the same time bitcoins would be unmineable for a small period of time for the difficulty to decrease again. I think some alt coins suffered from this problem as their popularity waned.

Credit card transactions are fast because they've been around to develop the correct technology for a much longer time. I would like to see someone manage an ACH transaction in 10 minutes.
What does it matter if a merchant converts the bitcoins to fiat immediately or keeps them for later? If they accept bitcoin, then they accept bitcoin. Any further transaction doesn't matter.

Isn't there still an idea of "previous art?" Like if something is clearly being used by a lot of people I think It would be kind of hard to argue that your firm deserves a patent even in this retarded patent troll environment. The way I understand how trolls work is they are able to claim they had invented whatever the non-previously patented item was, or they buy the patent from the original inventor.

If they could win a case against him with the murder charges why didn't they bring it up in this case? I think they aren't sure if either case will go through, so instead of charging him with murder in here and then loosing, if they lose this case they will just hit him with the flaky murder charges.

The indictment doesn't matter. The government is not charging him with murder yet even though they claim to have enough evidence.
Drug "trafficking" is only a crime because of the stupid drug war, money laundering is also because of the drug war. The murder charges are entirely spurious. DPR pays a fed $40,000 to kill another fed, all while in every public appearance DPR espouses non-violence?
Bitcoin is larger than the Silkroad. The outcome of this case could have lasting ramifications for Internet freedom. Provide a business where illegal activity happens to take place?

Can you define intrinsic value without relation to anything that gold is used for? If gold is valuable because it is used in various properties that is a subjective extrinsic value. If someone discovers something that has a better use than one of gold's current uses, then it automatically looses some of that value. Gold is only valuable because people currently think it is valuable. If some gold asteroid is discovered, gold suddenly looses value significantly (assuming the asteroid is within a reasonable distance to get to). This is actually what happened to Spain after Cortes came back with gold from the Americas.

A Marxist has negative views about private property, really? No one I know of that is not trying to vilify capitalism has said that all charity is unethical. For one example, Ayn Rand's point is that charity at the sacrifice of your own well being is unethical since everyone's highest value should be themselves. Helping someone in a way that it does not lessen your own self-worth is not unethical and is generally praised.

It is anecdotal I know, but a friend mine does "taxing" on his own and occasionally with Uber in a Prius and he likes it very much. Also the few times I have used Uber I've talked to the driver about the service and they seemed very up front about any issues. Besides, if they don't like it I'm sure they could find another job.

If Uber starts offering less to drivers why wouldn't the drivers just use a competing service? The fear of monopoly predatory pricing and forcing lower wages is simply that, an unfounded fear.
Uber has no way of, "dominating all taxi services," because they have never been granted a monopoly like the taxi cartels.

This is merely a legal requirement. For all non-legal intents and purposes there is no difference between an employee and an independent contractor.

Most of the people driving for Uber are not the same kind of people that would be waiting in line for a taxi cab. Uber has specific stipulations about how old your car has to be and for certain subclasses inside Uber I think they require specific models and colors.

It is possible to specify the maximum places after the decimal allowed for denominations. So some day there might be a 0.0000000000000001 BTC referred to as a Gavin, or something else.

You know in the early years of the Internet there were only a select few people that had access to packet switching technology, but that didn't change how revolutionary the existence of packet switching technology was. Bitcoin and the blockchain are revolutionary for many reasons. One is that it doesn't require trust in a third party in order to transact coins. You have to trust the blockchain to be correct, but so does everyone else, and no one group has control over the contents of the blockchain.
