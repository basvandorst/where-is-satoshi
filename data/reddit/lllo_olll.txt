Why would I use bitcoin when I can use a debit card. Bitcoin saves me little to no money, since merchants can charge elevated rates for credit cards going forward, but not debit cards. You get the cash price for using a debit card.


Of course they protect from fraud. Banks are required to protect you from fraud by law. If you contest a charge, they will put the money back into your account with minimal effort. It usually takes 1 phone call.


For the 3rd time, we're talking customer advantages, not merchants. Any elevated fees are associated with credit card surcharges. 
Not cash. Not bitcoin. And not debit cards.
So again, why would I choose bitcoin over debit cards. I wouldn't. There are a whole lot of drawbacks associated with bitcoin (hassle of converting currency, inability to get funds back if they're stolen, etc), and zero savings.

My fees are 0% for Visa and 0% for AmEx. I am not a merchant.
And no, I don't pay indirectly either. Merchants accept Visa and AmEx because it remains lucrative for them to do so... even if there are associated fees. This very large group of customers - the ones who want to pay for stuff with money they don't have - isn't going anywhere. And merchants will continue to cater to these customers, regardless of what happens with bitcoin, because they want the business.

You asked and I answered. Any currency is subject to human greed and manipulation - including bitcoin. The more wealth involved, the more incentive there is to exert control over others.

@_date: 2014-11-17 01:22:54
Why? Two reasons.
1) Because miners are under increased pressure to sell. They have been operating at diminished returns week after week, throughout all of 2014.
2) There are no large pools of new users, from the beginning of the year until now. In fact bitcoin offers little incentive for your average Western consumer in the first place.
Increased supply with static demand leads to tumbling prices. Which is exactly what we have right now. And until something changes dramatically, there will be no new ATH bubbles.
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:58:41


False (or at best, highly questionable) assumption. What drives user adoption is utility. And right now, bitcoin offers little to the consumer, beyond what traditional payment networks already provide.

No I'm not. I have both a checking and a savings account, and the bank takes exactly zero money out of each of them. I haven't paid a penny... either directly or indirectly.
And in fact I get interest for money in my savings account. It certainly isn't much, but the bank actually pays me and never takes a cent for themselves.

Some of you have zero idea what bitcoin even is. It's not credit. It doesn't compete with credit cards in any way, shape or form. It operates off what you own, not what you're able to borrow.
Also, no matter how successful bitcoin ultimately becomes, merchants will still jump through hoops to accept credit cards. Credit is a multi-billion dollar industry, and merchants are eager to tap into that market. Even if they have to pad themselves against chargebacks. Which they will continue to do - even if they accept bitcoin - because they will also still want to accept credit cards.

Assuming they stop accepting credit cards altogether, maybe. But this is flawed because:
1) Bitcoin doesn't operate off credit. It doesn't compete in any way, shape or form with credit cards.
2) No one is holding a gun to merchants' heads. They accept credit cards because they make money by doing so, regardless of the fees. Which means that even if bitcoin becomes wildly successful, merchants will still accept credit cards, and will still tolerate the fees.
So your argument - once again - makes no sense.

Before I stepped down as CEO, my company BitInstant was honored to have worked with his office for over a year.”
Immediately after getting arrested, his stance changed 180 degrees... and he now accuses regulators and bankers of targeting him because they're "afraid of bitcoin." Yet he conveniently overlooks the fact that he tried to sell $1 million in bitcoin to a site reknowned for illicit activities without notifying anyone.

In a future society where people use bitcoin as a medium of exchange... why would anyone want to have so many, when you can order a few checkbooks (say 20 satoshis) at a time, for pennies or less?
Bitcoin doesn't need an "exchange rate" if people agree one satoshi can represent anything of value, and they're using the blockchain as a public ledger to track transactions.

Not most people. 
I'm telling you right now, 4% isn't enough to secure a measurable increase in online sales, bitcoin or not, period. Starbucks could offer 4% discount on online merchandise in September, and it's highly debatable whether their September sales would outperform their August sales *even if everything else remained constant*. We're talking a flat discount to anyone who wanted it, no strings attached.
Entire online marketing departments struggle with this problem every damn day. How much of a discount should we offer to increase customers by 5%? How about 10%? The answer varies... but 4% discount is just plain not enough to instigate any measurable change in consumer behavior at all.

Coinbase buys their coins from Bitstamp, I believe. The direct exchanges are Bitstamp, BTC-E, Bitfinex, Kraken... I'm sure there are more.
Coinbase and Circle are essentially service providers. They enable you to quickly exchange USD for bitcoin, by linking your bank account to your Coinbase or Circle accounts. And in exchange for for making things easy... you pay them elevated fees for each transaction.
If you deal with true exchanges, you have to get your money to them (which typically involves a wire transfer). It's a time-intensive process. But they charge minimal fees, and have no restrictions on trades at all. You could trade a million dollars at a time if you wanted to.

And in terms of sweatshops... giving a pittance to desperate workers is debatable in terms of benefitting the surrounding community. Not so debatable on moral grounds - especially when you consider the often deplorable and dangerous working conditions that companies need to fix. But they don't, because it's just another expense.

I'm arguing that merchants today - and for the foreseeable future - will continue to pay the fees in order to accept credit cards. Because they make money by doing so (as the credit market is absolutely enormous). 
And you're suggesting that stores will pass savings back to customers. But that doesn't happen today for cash transactions. Even though cash transactions *should* be less expensive and merchants *should* avoid fees whenever possible.
So what we have, is direct evidence that your idea simply doesn't work.

Fractional reserve banking has nothing to do with "**free checking.**" And we are talking entirely about "**free checking**." You can open an account, or close it. You have precisely the same amount of money either way.
At this point not only do I question your ability to focus on the topic at hand, but I highly doubt your ability to understand basic English.
Your next move is to show me how free checking actually costs you something in addition to normal inflation (which everyone experiences... checking account or no... so possessing a checking account is irrelevant in terms of costing you more).

That's wrong too. The average US household credit card debt stands at $15,191. All of those purchases are made on credit - which you cannot do with bitcoin even if you wanted to. The credit divisions at VISA and MasterCard - their bread and butter - are not impacted by bitcoin whatsoever.

Violence is a part of human nature. It is - unfortunately - every bit as ingrained as laughter or embarrassment.
There is a compelling theory that genetically, violence has been selectively bred into the very fiber of human DNA. Look at any war throughout history... the people who were most likely to survive (and procreate), were the least phased by killing other people. Which is why we are plagued with a certain number of sociopaths who simply don't care about others. They can dance, celebrate, send troops to foreign soil or stab someone in the throat... all without feeling much of anything.
No matter how much you wish humans were different, we aren't. It's better to recognize reality and organize society into a form where violent individuals can be arrested at gunpoint, than it is to live in complete denial.

No I don't. I pay the same with a credit card as I do with cash, as I do with bitcoin (except for the promotional bullshit).
Merchants cannot offer less than cash price for bitcoin, unless they want to go bankrupt. And they must offer the same cash price for credit card transactions as required in the TOS.
Yet merchants still accept Mastercard and VISA because it's highly profitable for them to do so, even with the fees.
As a consumer, there is no reason to use bitcoin over a credit or debit card. It doesn't save money - other than bitcoin promotions (but then too, I get air miles and 6% incentives for paying off credit cards every month) - and it's a pain in the ass.

We're not talking about cash discounts. Merchants can now charge you more for using a credit card. There is a distinct difference, and people who can afford it - and who are motivated by 3% savings - will increasingly turn to cash. 
There is no compelling reason to think people will go to the time and trouble of acquiring and spending a foreign currency - namely bitcoin - when they can simply use dollars.


So you've provided some additional benefits for the merchant, and none at all for the consumer, compared to using cash. Congratulations. Now look at the title of this post again.
**Edit:** And if it's not already obvious... there seems to be no allowable surcharge for debit cards. From your own link:


So there is little - if any - discernible difference in savings between using a debit card and using bitcoin.

You don't go on international television and talk about a topic - whether it's legal, techno, finance, medical or anything in between - without making it relevant to a general audience.

Not to mention... bitcoin doesn't even compete with credit cards in the first place. Credit cards operate off of - what's the word I'm looking for - oh yes, "credit."
Bitcoin doesn't operate off of how much you can borrow.

Even if it was easy to convert... why would the masses *want* to convert?
Most people aren't particularly motivated by the fringe political element associated with bitcoin, and are perfectly happy holding fiat. 
If their bank account gets hacked, the bank is required by law to cover the losses. 
If they want to buy something quickly and easily, Google Play is a fantastic model which is becoming much more accepted, where a user can purchase anything online simply by typing in a password. 
And brick and mortar stores were never bitcoin's strong suit in the first place, because debit / credit cards are substantially faster and don't require awkward QR codes and so forth.

You must be mentally retarded. Seriously. The average household in America owes over $10,000 on credit. Which means these people don't have the cash. Which means they need a lender in order to buy shit. Which means they care very much about buying on credit.

Libertarians are easiest to manipulate because they demand zero actual solutions. All they require is someone to tell them how bad the state is.
Getting a bunch of them to give you money would require a few paragraphs, telling them you'll build a utopia without regulations, without government, without the use of force against community members. Without this and without that.
And they just nod, like you're some brilliant genius that is going to set up a perfect utopia based only on nothing more than common hatred of regulations.

I became interested in bitcoin because of its promise to bank the unbankable. Anyone with a smartphone has access to an instant checking account. And from what I understand, it is technically possible to expand this functionality to some "dumb phones" which are currently pervasive across Africa and elsewhere.
The reality today, however, is that bitcoin's volatility prevents it from being a useful medium of exchange. You or I might not be able to go out for beers if bitcoin loses 60% of its value. Whereas a subsistence farmer will literally starve to death.
Bitcoin still interests me... but the volatility issue must be resolved before it becomes widely useful to non-speculators.
