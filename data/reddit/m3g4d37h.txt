Wow, even more to extrapolate from that?
You're an angry little man.  I didn't make the slums the way they are, I just recognize the potential dangers.

Have you ever lived in a slum?  If not, shut your fuckin' pie hole.

That you are the only one not to get the sarcasm, which implies that you are a dummy.
Not my opinion, just the lay of the land.  Deal with it, son.

have you ever lived in a shitty part of town?  Reality is places like this aren't subject to your indignance.

So, did an Oregon man or Oregano man send it?
