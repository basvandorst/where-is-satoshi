Buy the dip. Just keep stacking sats.
Also reminder: Do not keep you BTC in exchanges or this bullshit that's going on now days about getting interest from your BTC. This shit is being used to borrow and dump on the market with your BTC. Stop waiting for PROOF OF KEYS in January and do this everyday. Buy it then straight to your cold storage. Let's see if these exchanges actually have all this BTC they claim they do. Someone open a thread and start this movement right now. PROOF OF KEYS EVERY SINGLE DAY. ��

You either on our side or your criminals known as govt. Bitcoin is not worth $7,500? Keep saying that to yourself while we are getting ready for 100k. No mercy for people who do not want to research. Get outta here.
