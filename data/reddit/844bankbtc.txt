Bitify is actually a pretty decent little market place and they are definitely trying to keep it on the up and up. 
They announced today they would no longer allow the sales of digital goods like giftcard codes.
"Over the past few weeks we have detected a sharp increase in the number of sales of gift cards through the site, some of which have led to claims from buyers that they have been purchased with stolen credit cards. We take these claims seriously and we have made every effort to moderate the site to remove suspicious listings and ban the users, but we have so far been unable to prevent them from creating new accounts with masked IP addresses. We realize that we have many genuine customers who use our site regularly to sell gift cards and PayPal, so it is with great reluctance that we have made the decision to temporarily ban the sales of all digital items.
All listings for digital items are currently being removed from the site, and for the time being at least, any users listing such items going forward will have their account suspended. Over the next few weeks we are planning to introduce a new verification system, where users wishing to sell digital items will be required to provide us with sufficient documentation in order to prove their identity to AML standards. Until this system is in place, we feel it is only right to suspend sales of all digital items, gift cards, and PayPal.
Effective immediately, if you are found to be buying or selling digital items on the site you will be suspended immediately without any notice.
Meanwhile, if you are ready to get verified manually, please contact us through our support portal and we can organize manual verification of the account.
Please accept our apologies for this decision and the inconvenience it will cause to our genuine users.
Team bitify "

You are pretty much screwed. They are holding your money to see what clears. Best case they will soon say "You have 30 days to get your money out". Worst case they will shut down your account and send you a check in a few weeks.
When you are ready to start again here are some tips for you

We had ads on LocalEthereum for months, almost 50 trades started and 96% of those were scams

I was on Mycelium for awhile. The issue is its a lot of spam and no way to report their ads

Their forums are here

My coins were released about 4 days ago (so locked for 3 months).
They also posted to the forum they would be providing an explanation soon. Not sure what soon means since Bitwallet staff only seem to appear about once every 6-8 weeks.
