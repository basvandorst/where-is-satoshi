Thats why you still are an early adopter and thats why bitcoins are below $2000. If/When Bitcoin is perfect, there is no risc, and there will be no reward, it will just be a currency.

1. It all depends on from what date you are one week is a tiny amount of time, most would look at the value of a stock atleast in a period of a couple of months. One week is not a long perspective. 
2. Parabolic is less than logarithmic. The value of Facebook increased from 0 to 100 billion in 6 years. That would equal an increase avarage of $2 every day for Bitcoin during 6 years from now. To say that its a bubble is a bit early.
The value of google increased from zero in 1998 to $250 billion in 2013. 
Most would say its a bubble every day for several years.
 
Bitcoin has increased from zero to 1.5 billion in 4 years. Thats another 98.5 billion untill its Facebook valued.

Only 30,850 Btc needed for value of $2000

Some merchants can only be certain after 180-365 days ofcourse most dont know this.
"I just got a chargeback on a charge from 1 YEAR ago. Yes you heard me, 1 YEAR, actually, 1 YEAR 1 MONTH and 7 DAYS ago. Of COURSE it's AMEX. This was a payment made through 2checkout.
Man it's getting bad when money paid to you OVER A YEAR ago can be taken away."

There are by far more than enough for everyone on earth.
You think a Bitcoin is expensive? If Bitcoin takes off they will be several thousands of dollars in the future. By any means they are cheap right now thats why the price goes up.

In the future it might not be about how much FIAT money you have but how many Bitcoins you have. Trading Bitcoin for FIAT might look like a joke.

From comments:
The head of FinCEN, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, gave a keynote speech at a conference this week. From her prepared speech:
“Those who use virtual currencies exclusively for common personal transactions like receiving payments for services or buying goods online are not affected by this guidance.”

You want to know the price range of those. Let me see.
Probably somewhere around 1-200 Btc.

There will probably be better alternative coins all of those have some big flaws or is simply to identical to bitcoin except Namecoin. But there is a better version for distributed DNS than Namecoin in the works. 
Currently those alternatives are not good enough.
Bitcoin is backed by hundreds of developers and will only grow even faster ahead of the others.
However some of those coins might be able to experiment more than Bitcoin such as PPC. PPC is still to centralized though and I think better versions of the concept will be developed.

People paid have been paying tax when there were cash only, and cash is even more anonymous than bitcoin. In the future if bitcoin grows big, you will not be able to get away with any large tax dodging.

Get a yubikey for that sum of money and use twofactor etc for that sum.
Also time is money, even more so if the price increase 20% while you wait for the money to arrive to MtGox (takes often atleast a week). Ofcourse there might also be a correction before your money arrives.

You call that a bubble? Wait a year or two than we can talk bubbles.

If you where a smart early adoptor or smart innovator of this technology and took a risc, would you sell all your coins crashing the market? No.
If you buy Facebook stocks are you afraid that Mark will crash the market. If you buy google or Apple stocks are you afraid of that because any of the large owners can crash the market...
The European central bank looked at Bitcoin in a 178 pages report and came to the conclusion that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi or Pyramid.
Quote from: 
On the one hand, the Bitcoin scheme is a decentralised system where – at least in theory – there 
is no central organiser that can undermine the system and disappear with its funds. Bitcoin users
buy and sell the currency among themselves without any kind of intermediation and therefore, it
seems that nobody benefits from the system, apart from those who benefit from the exchange rate
evolution (just as in any other currency trade) or those who are hard-working “miners” and are
therefore rewarded for their contribution to the security and confidence in the system as a whole.
Quote from: 
Moreover, the scheme does not promise high returns to anybody. Although some Bitcoin users may
try to profit from exchange rate fluctuations, Bitcoins are not intended to be an investment vehicle,
just a medium of exchange. On the contrary, Gavin Andresen, Lead Developer of the Bitcoin
virtual currency project, does not hesitate to say that “Bitcoin is an experiment. Treat it like you 
would treat a promising internet start-up company: maybe it will change the world, but realise that
investing your money or time in new ideas is always risky”. In addition, Bitcoin supporters claim
that it is an open-source system whose code is available to any interested party.
Quote from: 
Another recurrent issue is whether Bitcoin works like a Ponzi scheme or not. Users go into the
system by buying Bitcoins against real currencies, but can only leave and retrieve their funds if
other users want to buy their Bitcoins, i.e. if new participants want to join the system. For many 
people, this is characteristic of a Ponzi scheme. The US Securities and Exchange Commission
defines a Ponzi scheme in the following terms:
A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing
investors from funds contributed by new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new
investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little
or no risk. In many Ponzi schemes, the fraudsters focus on attracting new money to make promised
payments to earlier-stage investors and to use for personal expenses, instead of engaging in any
legitimate investment activity.

What a retarded guy he really makes a fool out of himself. He interupts when she want to quote Nassim Taleb, the guy says he is not a economist etc etc. Both the blond woman and Nassim are way more intelligent than he himself will ever be. There are real possible problems with Bitcoin but not any of the ones they mentioned.

When someone even a Nobel prize winner says bitcoins are bad because deflation. What the F**** are they talking about? 
Deflation might, just might be bad if its a single countrys only currency that is deflating. Bitcoin is not a currency of a single country, thus the deflation of Bitcoin do not affect export or tourism industry. 
They speak of bitcoin as if it was the only currency used, in a single country, which its not. They dont even think in the term that people might have multiple currencies they use so their arguments are totally invalid. They mean zero zipp, nada that argument is a joke. Bitcoin will probably not be any big countrys only currency in 50-100 years. 
Its like saying Facebook/Google/Any stocks are bad because they go up in value, so people dont want to spend their money as the stocks go up and there is allways some stock which increase in value.
And ofcourse even Bitcoin would not allways increase a lot in value after most people use it, it would slow down more and more, its only in the adaption stage the first 10-20 years the value could increase a lot.
After that the value might simply work as a interest rate and do they tell you interest rate is a bad thing? That noone shops because of interest when having money in a bank.
You might also want to watch this.

I cant buy from them. They are too expensive especially this month when Bitcoin is taking off. They should give atleast 10% of every buy if they really want to meet their goal.

Easy explaination: Miners are awarded Bitcoins for securing the network and forwarding transactions. This cost time and very high energy bills. Thus bitcoins are created out of work and energy. 
Not with the press of a button such as fiat which is created everytime someone takes a loan.
That noone can create more bitcoins out of air, means that you can not lend out a bitcoin you do not have. Which is a much more fair system of money.

Make sure you turn on Twofactor authentication and email backups on Blockchain. otherwise you might get screwed if/when they get hacked. Also have the email backups sent to a twofactor email service. 
Get an account at MtGox, bitstamp, bitcoin-central, etc and wire/SEPA some money to that account, now exchange that to Bitcoins.
Or kapiton.se,btcx.se or localbitcoins.com
Just dont keep your coins on any of the exchanges for too long.
And third.
Just do it.

Yes, a change is discussed in the open. A consensus is achieved among developers and sometimes miners and if most agree that change in the code is good it will be spread out among the biggest mining pools and users. Sometimes its a change that only works if a majority of miners apply the new rules. If miners and users do not agree and do not update their clients. The change will not work.

No, Bitcoin is the worlds first currency with a known amount produced. 
No matter if google will allow transfers of money with 0 fees they will use fiat currencies as money base. And as we all know those will allways go down in value because of endless printing. 
So even that would not harm Bitcoin very much.
Bitcoin will not be driven by drugs. It could even be good for Bitcoin if Silkroad and Satoshi Dice stopped. Since SD creates bitcoin spam and Silkroad probably makes Bitcoin exchanged into dollars, dumping the price of the coins.
Its driven by its unique deflationary, its zero chargeback properties and dont need drugs. in fact such a outcome might make bitcoins more valuable since there will be no  "Bitcoin is used to buy drugs" argument against it.
