ok, I will try to find exchanges to understand the fees, thank you.

How does BTC generate income?

Just so I understand bitcoin tx fees. 
If I take $100 dollars, and somehow convert it into bitcoin, and then convert that bitcoin back to dollars, how much would I have left over?

I remember seeing people buy a pizza with bitcoin when it was really cheap, but it seemed really shady with all the dark web stuff going on, so I forgot about it. Then later, I recall someone in a game chat was saying, you guys better get into bitcoin now - it was about $200, I could have bought about 100k then, but didn't, and I watched him get rich as it hit the peak and he said he sold and retired, while I went to work every day. Looking at it now, its about $6k a coin. I feel like I missed out on the whole thing. It seemed like one of those opportunities that only come a few times in someones life and I feel like I missed it. I have a lot of spare cash, but I am still hesitant to buy bitcoins. I don't know why. If I trend from beginning, 6k is more than the pennies it was, if I trend from peak to now, its pointed down. How to convince myself to buy this instead of some other assets. I don't buy gold, I have +1m in broad market low cost index funds and company stock mainly, have another 300k coming from sale of a house. I feel like I want to put some in btc, but I'm in my mid 50s getting ready to retire, I'm still wary...

I missed adding , theoretically, all things being equal, assuming it was the same price coming and going, which I know is not real world, I was just trying to get an idea of total round trip fees. 
Can you explain repeated transaction fees? 
I think I read somewhere, trying to use bitcoin as a put and take payment vehicle wasn't going to work because of the tx fees, that is why I was interested.

is this the tldr at the end?

Clearly the horizontal line on the bottom of the graph is trending up!

please explain what is coming?

Holding out for $100 bitcoin to jump in.

Looking forward to that $100 price again so I can get in!
