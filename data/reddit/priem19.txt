Sarcasm? Because I deliberately made it so simple in reaction to all the redundant nonsense and hidden trackers on most other websites. It's ridiculous how slow and annoying websites have become while data transfer speeds have increased.

Not for long though: [ISOC sold the .org registry to Ethos Capital for $1.1B](

CPU is stable at 67°C in the hottest, and 62°C in the coldest core. However, it's winter, and the desktop is standing in an unheated area; I'll have to decrease my overclock on hot summer days.

I love it. Checking every day if things still run properly, knowing perfectly well they will, but actually just want to look at the crunched numbers or connected peers.

I'd rather go down in history by finding the 52'nd Mersenne prime. However, I obviously wouldn't say no to 12.5—soon to be 6.25 bitcoin—as it would definitely cover the costs of powering my machine for the next decade.

PS This is an older picture; the SLI bridge is now gone because each GPU runs different SETI tasks, and each card now has a dedicated power cable as opposed to sharing a cable twice.

It's not mining. There's no award except for [$5000]( if you happen to find a prime number, which is unlikely and not the point.

* Why do people find these primes? [
* Why donate your computer cycles to GIMPS? [
* Curiosity. Fascination. A kind of satisfaction from being part of something esoteric and bigger than myself.

Yeah I know, but it's like adding a droplet of water into the ocean; an insignificant contribution. Running a full node or GIMPS is not.

They are two fascinating pieces of technology worth donating your idle PC to. I came across GIMPS after being disappointed I couldn't mine Bitcoin to strengthen the network, even if it ran at a loss. My reason for joining GIMPS is identical: to be part of the network—something bigger than the sum of its parts. Moreover, you're a part of history both for verifying whether an exponent does or doesn't produce a Mersenne prime. Finally, the most profound similarity between Bitcoin and GIMPS: my contribution to these esoteric endeavors simply invigorates my curiosity.

As long as things don't melt it doesn't matter, every contribution *counts*.

[Ads are evil]( so I applaud your choice not the succumb to the pressure. To encourage donations you *could* add in-game objects referencing the donators in proportion with the given amount; e.g. it would be silly add a dedicated monster to everyone who donates $0.5. Anyway, keep it subtle because the game looks fantastic.
