They are not really banning anything. They are just making steps to bring it under their already existing laws for kyc excetera
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:38:15
And? Active considering is. Far cry from trying to ban.

I dont see how you could profit from that. You would have to own a ton of the total miners. Then at that point I dont think doing this to all the atms would be worth the time.

This is like round 3 of this type of hoopla. It will pass.

Wooo hoo bitaccess!

We Just got another Keg from there yesterday for the Denver Bitcoin Center. They are one of our sponsors and we have their beer at the meetups!

I have talked to several of their developers about it. They are for sure interested. Last time I talked they were more focused on reaching their audience with full features first, and then looking into implementing bitcoin along with other payment methods. 
follow me on ello

Bitcoiner's "No charge backs and way more cool things about bitcoin."
Everyone else "but what if they take your money and never deliver"
Bitcoiner's "Ha, just use someone trusted. If you're smart you wont get scammed..."
edit: corrected your to you're.

I really like this! Would be happy to help update!
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:35:39
shhh don't tell everyone about telegram.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:09:57
What makes you say that? Any reference to that all that you can point too? 
Also haven't many of the most brilliant minds worked for one government or another? How does that diminish intellect, or even be a real problem?

Got to get some decent arcades in Vietnam to accept it. But it won't be completely best untill you don't have to cash out the BTC. Just send it to the game directly. Can't do that with the fees today though.

My ex girlfriends are. She trashed it to spite me years ago. Bet she wish she didn't.
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:20:24
Glad to hear. Let me know when you get to town!
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:49:30
right because its a ~~security~~ token not a pump and dump ico. So just like every real funding round of any real company ever.
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:20:40
only in the sense that they can reap value in the future production of the company.

A butterfly told me he hated your post so he is going to have his cousin f with the price.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:19:13
But your forgetting about the butterfly effect! You never know what those damn bugs are up to.

This is not an exsact �� answer just like ever other Indicator. Why is peoples first response that it is wrong some times. 
Duh. 
So is every tool everyone uses to trade. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:18:52
Maybe you and I. I dont think most can. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:27:45
Maybe we will get a speculative run-up just from this. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:19:55
Create currency and use a sudonym. But creativly use your own name? Makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:34:37
So this is a post about not talking about price. I think probably will get mod crushed no? Very confusing.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:18:37
Yea seems like a silly question. But probably only for those that understand math and computers. I often forget that not even 20 years ago people were still saying that the internet is just a fad. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:27:14
Thanks for doing this. Ill throw mine in too. Wonder how much they paid.
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:26:16
Every year I see this. Every time it makes me smile. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:43:01
Only couple merchants right now. but plan on changing that very soon. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 01:19:16
im not sure. But I really hope not. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:16:39
Lol well I just posted it. Just me and Shawn! Going to learn all the ins and outs of airbitz.
