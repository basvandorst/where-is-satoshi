If you've got multiple cars you aren't poor.

Okay. I'm gonna actually respond now. I started paying attention at around 12k. At 12k, I was saying that there was some kind of bubble going on, yeah. I didn't claim to know when it would pop.
Maybe it wasn't clear that 20k was the peak, but it was definitely clear that those prices were unsustainable and that they were going to have to drop at some point. So, buying right after a huge, really fast rise was a big risk. I mean, at the time, transaction fees were huge, the mem pool was full... It's not like there weren't signs that it was gonna pop.

Well, I was saying it was a bubble at the time.

Sorry to hear it. Hope things get better.

Not very. Whenever bitcoin is popular, the transaction fees go through the roof. It's not even great for shady activity because it isn't anonymous. Bitcoin has to be more practical than something like Venmo for at least one purpose. Right now it isn't really better than venmo at anything.

Pretty silly of you to buy at what was clearly the peak of a speculative bubble.

Expensive and useful are not the same thing. Beanie babies were once expensive.

I'd love to see the stats on how many people in those countries are using bitcoin due to it being more reliable than their currencies.
Also, are you really trying to say that bitcoin is more reliable than the Euro?

My point wasn't that Venmo was not like a bank. Just that it's more convenient than bitcoin. You want mass bitcoin adoption? Then it has to be better at something and more convenient than traditional payment methods like Venmo, or google pay or whatever else. The average person doesn't care about all the ethical stuff bitcoin fanatics care about.

Uh, good?

I think the right to own and trade means of production you do not yourself use is, yes.

No, if you own a factory that makes drills, you are not using the factory, your workers are. They are the ones generating your profit. I'd ask at which point the amount of profit they've generated for you outweighs your initial investment in the factory and the drills. After that point they've essentially bought your factory for you, and it should be theirs.


You can voluntarily be exploited, the two aren't mutually exclusive. Exploitation is when the amount of value generated by workers exceeds what they are paid, and the excess goes to the capitalist. 
I would argue, also, that the choice to work for you is not meaningfully voluntary. They work for you because you own the factory, which you own. You protect your ownership with the states power. Practically all the means of production, and therefore the means of survival, are owned in our capitalist system. Yes, their best option is to work for you, but purely because you, and the rest of the capitalist class, have ownership of the means of production. To illustrate this, imagine you get stranded on an island covered in fruit trees. On the island is a  man who has a gun and says he owns the trees. You can pick from the trees, he says, but only if you give him half the bounty. You would of  course choose to do so, and to do so would be your best choice, but that does not make this situation just.
To answer your third question, the answer is that they could not own the drills, because they would need capital to buy a factory and drills for workers and to pay wages. You can do these things, and expand your enterprise, because you initially had the capital to do so. Once your workers start generating you profit, you can reinvest and grow your enterprise. Surely you see how you have the advantage here. It is in your interest as the capitalist to pay your workers as little over what they need to survive as you can get away with. Whether or not you are great at running a drill company doesn't really matter, you can simply pay someone to run your factory for you.

No. First, Ice Skates aren't the means of production. At least, not for most people. If you want me to clarify, I don't support a system where someone can own land/machines that he doesn't use, and use the labor of those who do to buy more he won't use. So, if you were to own a factory full of drills, and hire lots of people to use the drills, it would be wrong of you to exploit the value those workers produce. Though this is sort of inevitable in a capitalist system. Hence, I want a system where the workers using those drills own the drills.
