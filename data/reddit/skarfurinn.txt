All the statistics you might need 
A lot of financial information here 
Under "Material of interest" you can find a report "Icelandic Economic Situation Overview". Might give some picture of the situation though I doubt it tells all the story.

That is absolutely correct nor did I or dinobotta claim it was so. Bitcoin or all other cryptocurrencies for that matter are quite legal in Iceland. You can own it, buy, sell, trade and so forth, nothing banned there at all. 
However we have currency restrictions that generally prevents us from exchanging our worthless ISK into any other foreign currency. Of course we all get exceptions to these restrictions to buy necessities and normal credit card usage is not restricted. The central bank has issued an [official statement]( where they state that the Icelandic public will not get an exception to these restrictions and be able to buy foreign currency with the purpose of purchasing cryptocurrencies. This is nothing special as this applies to a lot of things but it however prevents any real Bitcoin adoption in Iceland at this time.

Do you think you will see any Bitcoin adoption in Iceland with only these remote (technically illegal) options in place?
Yes there are ways to buy Bitcoin in Iceland and the central bank will not be running after a few souls though technically they are breaking the capital controls. However you will never see any real Bitcoin adoption while the situation is like this and Iceland is already behind when it comes to cryptos.
I'm 100% a Bitcoin fan like dinobotta mentioned here and I would love to see it used instead of Auroracoin in Iceland. It's just not remotely realistic to think that it will happen in the near future.
