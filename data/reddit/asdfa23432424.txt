The virvox text I quoted indicates that it sometimes goes away.. maybe just keep trying to deposit and maybe it will eventually work after some time.
Perhaps you could get someone else with an SL account to deposit the SLL for you? to be hoenst I don't know if that would help or just make the transaction look even more suspect :p
other options.. well maybe sell the SLL to someone else who wants to actually use it in game and either go back to trying to deposit directly into virwox or just forget about SLL and buy the BTC some other way.. I recommend  for buying btc in the uk using either pingit or a direct fasterpayments bank transfer from your online banking.

I'm guessing the OP bought SLL from someone 'in game' and then tried to deposit them to virwox.. in theory this should work, but in practce I think you often run into difficulties depositing the SLL if your account isn't old enough or trusted enough according to some secret metrics. This is due to problems with stolen SLL being deposited that could potentially be charged back from virwox.
If you're just interested in buying BTC, don't bother with secondlife.. just buy the SLL on virwox and then immediately convert them to BTC. SLL already held in virwox don't need to pass this risk checking.. it happens when you deposit SLL at an in game virwox terminal.
edit; from the virwox site;
Why is my Linden dollar deposit denied by the Risk API?
Linden Lab does not tell us (or anybody), why their Risk API passes or denies payment. They just say it is dynamic and has several variables. It helps that a resident has a Second Life account with 30 days or more with payment information on file.
In our experience, this is sometimes just a temporary problem which disappears in a few hours.
