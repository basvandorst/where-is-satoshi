I don't believe I am, there's nobody but us in this thread so it's mostly me attempting to deal with your vitriol. 


Then why do they use the same block chain as core? 
Core is a client, the blocks that clients create go to form the bitcoin block chain, all clients that produce blocks that 51% of the network agree are valid bitcoin blocks are bitcoin clients. BU, classic &amp; core all do this. 
The reason the clients are able to create a block that the other clients agree is valid is that they all use the same proof of work algorithm. 
This is fundamental, you either choose not to know this, or don't know this. 


Who deems worth, the miners via hashrate?


Which point are you refering to here? 


That's not the point I'm trying to make. 


Some would disagree and believe that a hardfork with a block size increase would be a more suitable method to resolving the block size debate. 


Again it's not clear which point you're addressing here. I don't doubt that the team is technically qualified nor that it isn't seizable. 


However during peak times the fees required to get into a block can be high and many users often find their transactions stuck in limbo because they paid the normal rate fee. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:01:32


They're waring festering abominations that serve only to post propaganda that supports their view while slating the other team, with commenters from both sides crossing the boarder to smear shit in the other board. 
Both subreddits are an absolute joke and the fact that either of them represents bitcoin users in the global forum is an embarrassment. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:29:03
We aren't vultures picking through the half rotten scraps to find what tasty morsels have been left untouched. 
This is a new financial system that we only barely understand the implications of, its young community should be vibrant and welcoming as we slowly show the world the clear superiority of this system over their outdated and corrupt fiat systems. But to do that you have to wake people up to what their fiat systems are which is something they haven't considered. 
No new user is going to enjoy this experience and no long-term user is going to enjoy being in either community unless they have chosen their "side" and somehow enjoy engaging in the shit flinging. 
Yes there is good content here, yes there's more independent thought there but neither subreddit is worth reading when a solid 20% of its content is clearly toxic.

the same can be said of bitcoin,core and AXA


You have done nothing but ramble on about how bad btc are for at least 3 comments. 


They have technical differences that are worth something, the option to choose how bigger block you want to accept is one of these


They are a definition of bitcoin, they use the same PoW


Logical fallacy: No true scotsman


Yes there is, there are multiple bitcoin related projects, core is one of those, it's also the majorit share holder in hash power. 


No arguments that there aren't, however classic and unlimited use the same proof of work and therefore are bitcoin. 


I think you need to read up on what unlimited would allow before you dismiss it as entirely as you have 


Aside from the obvious scaling issue and rising fees, I don't disagree with you. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:06:25


No they aren't they use the same PoW, you're continuing your crusade against and on further proving my point. 
Please read and understand what I mean when I mean when I say comments that exist only to attack the opposing subreddit are detrimental to the community. 
Additionally to take your comment apart, 


Code is logic and science, they have code. 


I think we both know that there are long term bitcoiners on both sides of the border, and btc is not destructive. 


The same is said of axa and core, your entire comment makes as much sense if you replace btc with bitcoin and "ClassicCoin" with "CoreCoin"


This happens on both subreddits and is a problem in both communities. 


Why, that's not central to my argument at all, I don't support either side.

Yes I recall the last time the baptists bombed the Lutherans. 
I think we can both agree that a true christian wouldn't be concerned with something as petty as which branch of Christianity their neighbors follow (nor would a Scotsman for that matter). We can debate about what constitutes a christian here if you'd like, but there is a guiding code.
Gods kingdom is an autocratic dictatorship, that works for a benevolent divine and any who oppose that rule are wrong, in the case of humans however perhaps having a consolidation of power is perhaps not the wisest as humans are fallible, they abuse power and what's more as we can see from the Vatican, they protect their own. 
I'd argue it's better to have many branches of the same ideology as long as they don't interfere with each other.

The economic basis for bitcoins growth against fiat does not rely on people losing coins, it is that miners will expend resources energy primarily to solve harder problems for a smaller reward.
What's more those coins while lost are not destroyed, chances of them being recovered are slim but the coins still exist. 
It is deceptive to call bitcoin deflationary when the available supply is increasing and will continue to do so until a set date. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:53:00

I actually talked about this over at a while back. 
My theory was that with longer &amp; larger blocks you could do this as you would need time for the TXs to propagate through the network &amp; for the blocks to be established confirmed and then built upon. 
you need bigger blocks because otherwise the TPS would be very limited given that you would want to produce a block on the hour-day range for close planets and day-week scale for everything in our solar system.

unlikely isn't a function in standard libs so you'll want to import that from somewhere what's more while its purpose is unclear, you don't actually need it. 
"BCH hashpower" would need to be BCH_hashpower to be valid but again both it and BTC are undefined 
If you are using unlikely you'll probably want to attach the brackets to it 
And finally you'd want a while loop here. 
     emptymatrixmath import unlikely
    from hashgetlib import hashpower
    BCH_hashpower=hashpower(BCH)
    BTC=hashpower(BTC)
    while true:
       # if (unlikely ( BCH hashpower &gt; BTC)):
        if BCH_hashpower &gt; BT:

Bitfinex does have ~1 Billion in assets in their bank accounts (as revealed through the documents they have made public) and I've no doubt that if you had 200k BTC that you could find someone to do an OTC transaction with.

It costs $4 to make one BTC in electricity &amp; they need to pay back the loans they used to buy their equipment at $1 a month
Their average income is  5 BTC a month. 
BTC cannot fall below $1 because no miner would sell to lose money. 
OH NO, 4 years have passed. 
Now the miners only get 2 BTC a month, what happens to the price?

Not really, it's about transaction size and fee. 
A miner will be incentivised to include the highest fee/byte transaction he can. 
Although 1sat/byte has been common recently and most nodes don't relay 0sat/byte 
You don't need permission from a third party to transact your funds and a miner is not going to deny your inclusion in a block unless your not paying enough or your tx is malformed because you wrote it by hand or something dumb.

a $5 tx with 1BTC fee will confirm just as fast as a 50BTC tx (assuming 1 input for both txs) with $5 fee, because nobody is paying that much in fees you're essentially guaranteed to get included in the first block which is as fast as bitcoin can go. So you're looking at ~10 minutes until 1 conf (because you have no idea where in the 10m cycle you're broadcasting) 
If we want to get into whether having funds to cause a transaction is *permission* or not then we're really far down the rabbit hole.

@_date: 2017-10-12 05:48:57
Because you're using a peer-to-peer digital currency with no requirement for third-party to allow you to transfer your money. 
The rules of the system force the price to AT LEAST double every four years but with increasing hash rate the price has to increase as well for miners to cover their own costs. 
It's nationless, it's cheap to use, it's very secure and the "coin" doesn't need a vault or a physical space, you can keep it in your head or on paper so it can't be taken from you. 
There will only ever be 21 million and there are 7.3 Billion people to share it between and one of those numbers increases a lot faster than the other.
I'll admit that 1m by 2020 is kind of a joke, like if I said it enough times and enough people believed it then it might just happen, but the thing is that it actually might, that's why.

As someone holding a very large percentage of their savings in bitcoin, I can say that under my circumstances doing s has been very advantageous.

The price rise is primarily indicates that bitcoin is growing and that there is interest in it, it's a symptom of increased demand against limited supply, in short as much as ASIC mining farms are something may have changed the ecosystem fundamentally, it is not a bad thing in my opinion. 
I would argue the limit to bitcoins usefulness originates from it's present inability to scale beyond the current number of transactions per second as well as interest. One of these issues seems be resolving its self slow however as interest grows, the evidence of the issues relating to small blocks (and no side changes if you're so inclined) becomes more pronounced. 
However as a speculative asset, I firmly believe that bitcoin is very undervalued at present, intrest is increasing, the COIN &amp; SolidX ETFs are coming soon, utility is increasing every day as more businesses begin to accept bitcoin and finally we are all very well aware of incoming financial troubles, both for the banking industry as a whole and the national fiat currencies. 
All of these things do and will continue to inspire interest in bitcoin, causing greater demand the same supply as far as I can see, the price is only set to head in one direction.

It was originally a quote about planting trees, but the same sentiment applies and you could point out the obvious there too, thankfully you were here to inform us that you can't buy bitcoin in the past or plant trees in the past unless your past self already did so. 
If not for your massively insightful comment we'd all be stuck wondering how to do it, maybe we'd even be trying to do it, it would probably cause a sprained wrist or twisted ankle, but luckily due to your (as previously mentioned) observation of almost terminal obviousness, that entire scenario has been averted.

Initial opening of the channel was slow, but if I switch my mindset from bitcoin today to bitcoin+LN and imagine bitcoin somewhat differently. 
The way I see things now I have cold storage (on a locked down wallet), spendable storage (on my phone). Where as what I needed to do was add an additional step, rename spendable to available, then open a channel with my spendable amount. 
Then buying something was stupid fast, as in I scanned the QR and jumped when it was instantly accepted.

Totally agreed, but I've worked with 0 conf transactions before and this beats them by a mile, nevermind 6+ conf needed for steam or something. 
I can now imagine going into a coffee shop, scanning a QR and getting my coffee or using self checkout, scanning my food and then tapping to pay with BTC etc. 
Before it would have been 0 conf and hope they don't double spend and hang around for 30 seconds while the transaction gets to mempool. 
Also fees, opening costs a typical bitcoin transaction fee but past that, 530 sats per tx, plus congestion on the main chain will come right down with an alternative payment method so that will be cheaper too, plus 2x which means we've got room for massive expansion. 
I'm actually hyped.

You're also acting like a dick. 
Bitcoin is a great investment and you should attempt to sell it on that merit as well as its anarchic ones. 
Anything you can do to get more people interested and buying in, especially if those people have money, this drives up the price making it more attractive and spreads information to another peer group, this also puts bitcoin in the news and drives greater demand. 
Fiat will die, it will be an interesting time to be hodling.

*  it's devs hardfork transactions they disagree with off the chain
*  it has no use case aside from ICO spam
*  ICO spam isn't a good long term use case
* the ICO devs have the money now and can walk away without ever making their dapp
* it has to switch to pos within 18 months and that's a massive code base change
* the devs are dumping some of their premined stashes at prices they think are insane
* price movement seems to based heavily on drawing in dumb money through spammed advertising
