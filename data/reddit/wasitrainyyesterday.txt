A concise statement which mirrors my positions on the technical points.
I do wish I could hear more from Matt about how we can address the social challenges, but I think the focus and simplicity of this post was well chosen.
@_date: 2017-02-11 19:12:42
I too see this argument all the time in rbtc
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:57:28
Exciting! in that the core challenge wrt Bitcoin is being wrestled with as we speak.  How can we collectively agree upon the rules Bitcoin should follow?  How can we effectively govern (as decentralized as that governance may become) and protect the key features of Bitcoin.  Especially because the market follows no code and is made up of irrational, overconfident brains.
The tech is amazing, and remains interesting (and hasn't stopped progressing regardless of where bitcoin sits) but the hard to predict and thus interesting part to me has always been the interface between the network and the people.  The tensions we see are just a tiny tiny taste of the social challenge Bitcoin will face - its incredibly interesting.
To add, I think both things mentioned, Segwit (it's activation) and the ETF are more boring than the social issues right now.  The tech is neat but that's not going away whether it gets activated or not - it will hit other coins, the ideas will move around and get lumped together in various ways, the major question is who/what will be successful in the long run and that is mostly (unfortunately) a social question.

It's true that other miners may benefit disproportionately to the amount they spam, but a single miner flooding can still inflate fees enough for it to be the optimal strategy.  
Spamming currently doubles fee income for the whole block. Assume a miner must buy 10% of the block to achieve this increase in revenue.  Assume 70% of the spam fees are taken by other miners. Normal Fee: 80 sat/byte; Target Fee: 200 sat/byte
- Miner Cost: 2BTC/block * 0.07 = 0.14 BTC/block
- Fees gained: 1.2 BTC/Block * 0.3 = 0.36 BTC/block average
- Net: +0.22 BTC/block on average
As a miner controls more hashpower, or as demmand becomes more inelastic this inflation becomes cheaper.
But this is all missing the main concept - block space has a price and anyone can buy that space for as high a price as they see fit.  Miners get a discount proportional to their hash rate.  This is how Bitcoin works, spam or not it doesn't matter - there is no avoiding this regardless of scaling approaches.
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:04:48
Ah, right.
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:59:17
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:39:56
I have the same question.
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:28:44
Fees are around 100 sat/byte. Reward is 12E8/1E6 = 12E2 sat/byte. Current price is 1E3/1E8 = 1E-5 $/sat.
 - 450 byte transaction * 13E2 sat/byte * 1E-5 $/sat = $5.40
 - 1E6 byte block * 13E2 sat/byte * 1E-5 $/sat = $12,000
This is a good starting estimate of the electricity cost per transaction. Due to the competitive market, marginal cost moves to equal marginal benefit. Electricity is the majority of cost, and the value of bitcoin (I assume) is the majority of benefit to the miners.
How far from that equilibrium we are is interesting, but there are a lot of factors at play. Price increased 25% recently, so we likely over estimate power cost.  Speculation is a major factor, though, which would increase utility.  Other things like political control, forcing out competition, and irrational behavior might increase utility.
Regardless, this is a pretty good order of magnitude estimate but likely over estimates the power.

I have to share my experience as well - posing on rbtc is asking for abuse and down-vote brigading.  There are few to no discussions to be had there.

thanks for pointing this out -  have been looking for this.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:29:57
Several of these slices are controlled by the same entity.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:23:58
I'm running the same PC.  Advantage over Pi setups is that it has enough power to run an unpruned full node for the forseable future, as well as things like electrum server and act as a lightning node when it comes out.
@_date: 2017-02-11 19:10:45
It requires it to function in any reasonable way. Without trustless, delegatable channel enforcement I'm much less excited about lightning. Cheating becomes a real problem.
@_date: 2017-02-03 22:21:12
Here is the talk which preceded this one.  
MW made a big splash and is already highly anticipated due to its drastically improved scaling as compared to bitcoin (the entire bitcoin blockchain would be something like 10Mb on MW, though without scripts), though it has fewer scripting capabilities - this talk (and the intervening work) indicates the scripting capabilities are less restrictive than we previously thought.
Edit: better link
@_date: 2017-02-06 03:11:54
If it's ideal interrogation should be encouraged. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:59:05
Was the difficulty of the work ever mathematically proven? It's a neat idea but last I understood it would be unsuitable for Bitcoin due to the structure of the problem we don't know if there are any yet to be discovered shortcuts.
@_date: 2017-02-11 19:14:59
Yep 
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:36:57
Google published the collision.  The redeemer just transformed the already computed collision into &lt;512 bytes (necessary for the redeem script).
In other words, Google still deserves the bounty.

Fill me in?  I thought memory intensive was hard to scale with current DRAM technology, be botnet resistant, gpu friendly, and would encourage useful research.
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:10:11
I think the argument is that there is the risk of an enormous latent capacity that just needs tapped in order to gain 51+%. (Eg. nation state or well funded actor.)
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:38:41
they were hyping parallelized verification as a "novel feature" that in some way made BU more legitimate/safe.  Ignoring that premise, this rebuttal is funny.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:52:09
The proposal was to discourage spv mining and incentivise​ nodes by making the miners include a hash of a deterministic part of the block chain that requires most of the block chain be readily accessible in each block. "Proof of data".
The proof was chunked up such that miners could pay nodes to do parts of the proof.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:30:33
I feel like this should get shared more - the roadmap in a less dense form.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:37:53
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:33:56
What is the argument against this?  I read these proposals and they were compelling.  I'm surprised it hasn't gained more mind share. (Though this is a separate issue)
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:43:03
That's much more important in the current context, actually. Thanks.
Everyone agrees on the "compression".
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:39:09
Traditional file compression allows us to attain the on-disk benefits of LTCP I think.  Is the benefit of using delta compression the referenced data doesn't need to be present,  allowing compression to happen at the chain tip? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:36:56
It is different in some hedge-able ways but it still has scaling problems and also has what is likely a longer road than Bitcoin before being functional in the mainstream.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:07:37
Commentary here. The entire presentation is analogies and appeals to emotion. Then the questions come. Important questions unanswered.  Vague hand-waving regarding the critical points. Actually hearing "emergent consensus" discussed in this manner is terrifying. 
This is so disappointing.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:31:09
This is a good statement of the key interaction here.  It is a complex problem and it is easy to get lost in the details. Don't forget this point.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:33:05
10% is a lot of percents
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:48:18
I agree that the interface between the people and the protocol was always the primary risk - but I disagree with your confidence. It is certainly possible for Bitcoin to be subverted and tamed.  If this were to happen it is likely that an altcoin would fill its place as the state-free solution.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:40:42
I'm more worried about - if such a woefully inadequate proposal/alternate client/fork got so much traction... what happens when we come up against a real enemy with actual resources.
I fear two things. 1. The people's ability to influence the protocol has dwindled as economic power has centralized into the exchanges and mining power has centralized into the few.  2. Are "the people" even capable of resisting mass disinformation?
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:43:08
I'm curious what the lightning devs think of this approach.
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:06:44
How are Bitcoin reorgs handled?

It's more of a nothing lasts forever sort of suggestion.

I think the current goal is memory intensive.

Users not valuing the decentralized aspects of the currency leading to bank-like institutions with control over large swaths of coins (Coinbase - 10%, COIN ETF).  One of which will eventually be compromised severely damaging the economy in its growth stages.

What does this refer to?
 &gt; It’s obvious to all in attendance that the whole process was being held up by some individuals who have a good amount of influence and feel burned by the actions of everyone in the last year and a half. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:41:36
I had a similar experience with a beefier machine. The idea of electrum + electrum server is great, and in keeping with Core's ideals of trustless operation - but in practice electrum server requires specialized hardware to run. You need an SSD.
There may be a new version of server coming but I haven't heard anything recently.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:11:41
@_date: 2017-01-27 06:25:39
The developers have diverse opinions on the matter.
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:25:23
We are in uncomfortable waters. Better now than later as i imagine none of this could really be avoided anyway. Hopefully we actually have a system which is sustainable. Though it's possible we are watching the experiment fail...
Democracy is weird, bitcoins value is dependent on those believing it to be valuable. That's the weak point. And people are easily swayed.
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:34:18
This has implications for how altruistic the public has to be as well. I never expected non-commercial miners to be profitable - but at least on the same order of magnitude. Maybe this too, is unlikely.
So do you personally consider this an impediment to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:00:48
How similar is this concept to the mixnet needed for Mimblewimble privacy.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:19:13
It's not an attack, the fee-per-resource market is integral to bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:19:47
Does testnet have additional opcodes? Is cheating monitoring distributable without trust?
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:07:12
In this moment
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:01:29
If the system wasn't economically sound it wouldn't exist. If we have to rely on altruism we have failed.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:58:03
Finally, an implementation I can support.  BU failed to remove central planning from the network - I hope BU and Core supporters can come together to support the TRUE next generation of Bitcoin, Bitcoin EXTREME.
At the very least this is a clear improvement on the Bitcoin Unlimited design, and a nail in the coffin for BU.

Speed: we are continually increasing our speed at finding the answer to these problems.  The first graph on this page gives some indication of that:  though due to the exponential growth it overshadows the growth of years prior.
The "hardness" of this specific math problem can be adjusted in a way that is directly proportional to the time it takes to solve.  We refer to this "hardness" as difficulty.  The difficulty adjusts in empirical manner every 2016 blocks such that the new difficulty equates to a 10 minute block interval (time to solve) based on the previous 2016 blocks (this process is deterministic and dependent only on the previous blocks.  This is necessary because as everyone has to agree on the ledger, everyone also has to agree on the difficulty).
Variance: There are two sources of variance, the first is changes in hash rate.  If someone turns on a bunch of new hashpower during the 2016 blocks after a difficulty adjustment, the solutions come faster than every 10 minutes.  This occurs and is why the average block interval has historically been around 7 minutes.
The second source of variance is due to the probabilistic nature of finding a block.  This variance averages away looking at many inter-block-intervals but is noticeable looking at individual blocks.  This follows a Poisson distribution and is calculable.  I don't know numbers off the top of my head but as a rough idea we see 40 minute blocks and 30 second blocks monthly.
Edit: You can watch block creation live here to get an idea of the variance: 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:29:44
At minimum it is X% cheaper for a miner with X% of the hashrate to process transactions. It is likely greater than X% cheaper due to inelastic supply.
Other miners eating the lower fee-rate spam only makes the large miners spam cheaper. There is no way around this.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:29:02
Fees are low right now. Stop.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:35:19
Yep. Miners will maximize profit - with no block propagation constraints this requires choosing the set of transactions which provides the most fees within a given block size. This is also why RBF (replace by fee) works.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:38:40
Centralization of ISPs was an issue, I'm curious how far we have stepped towards a less centralized communication layer.
Whose sats are we running on? Whose nodes are the sats getting blocks from?

If they are dependent on outside funding this makes me nervous for the long term success of the platform.   3M isn't a lot, I wonder what their valuation was.
Regardless I think we are ages away in VC time from mass adoption - and that could spell trouble in a year or two.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:10:16
This does not help in the face of majority hashpower constantly reorging a chain.
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:01:27
Not, I guess - as the final transaction reveals the coin linkages prior to cut through.  
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:34:03
By that logic they should have called it his private key.

Sure, but Bitcoin isn't magic, it's correctly aligned incentives all the way to its core. And if those incentives become skewed Bitcoin can fail. 
Right now the incentives penalize the user in major possibly fatal ways.

It seems to me this sort of behavior is as much a part of Bitcoin as Bitcoin itself.  I get the reactionary criticism but in all I think this release is well within the bounds of acceptable behavior.  And if not, Bitcoin won't survive long.

oof! :D
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:51:09
This rediculous comment is helpful to the cause. In Roger's proposed scenario it is clear that BU coin is distinct from Bitcoin, with different social/technical properties. One coin belongs to the miners, the other to the users.
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:33:51
2:1 because is don't want to de-anonymize the other BTC by selling BCH. Otherwise it would be 2:0.

Iota is the only interesting coin in my eyes. It has markedly different properties and a legitimate use case.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:11:43
There is no guarantee the transaction will be confirmed and there is no guarantee the transaction will be forgotten.  There is a signed transaction floating around which moves your coins.  Someone somewhere certainly has a copy of that transaction and can rebroadcast it or include it in a block at any point in the future.
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:36:28
Replays are an inherent property of the tech. Its interesting in a general and specific sense. 
Especially the mechanism by which you could make transactions spendable on one chain only, even though there is a signed transaction floating around that at one point would have been valid on both chains. I'm interested in what solutions exist for this and if malicious forks can be created in which users cannot protect themselves. 
That would very much impact the incentives of forking.
