Got my equipment in, Stadicus. I've gotten pretty far but I'm running into, what seems to be, a common problem.
Error writing /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf: No such file or directory ]
I followed the suggestions in your [post]( on Medium and I am able to write and save the test file, so permissions/write access shouldn't be the problem.
Output in SSH looks like [this](
This is my first time trying Linux, so it could be something obvious I'm missing here. Anybody out there have any ideas/suggestions on where to go from here?

It wasn't the lnd_testnet dir. It was the broken symbolic link to .bitcoin -&gt;/mnt/hdd/bitcoin_testnet.
Solved it the same way you decribed though. sudo su into bitcoin user
$ mkdir /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_testnet
Now the link is valid, teal and blue colored. Was able to save the config file as well. Thanks!

I'm trying to get the mainnet running, but I may be missing something again. I can't sync the downloaded files, from bitcoin core (win 64bit), too the new mainnet. I copied /windowsuser/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin/blocks and /windowsuser/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin/chainstate using WinSCP to the proper folders.
When I start bitcoind it fails and the error is: IO error: /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/blocks/index/LOCK: Permission denied
I tried to reindex, from admin, but i don't have enough space on my SD drive. Apparently I don't have enough space on my SD card.
Do you know of a workaround? What could be causing this?

BTC testnet up and running! Made wallets, sent some transactions. It works!
I learned a basic understanding on how the terminal works too!
If I wanted to put this node on the mainnet, without lighting, would it be as simple as redirecting the symbolic link to a /mnt/hdd/bitcoin folder and copying a txindex copy of the mainnet blocks to the /mnt/hdd/bitcoin folder? Or would I have to start from scratch?

Figured it out. Mainnet is a go!
If anyone uses WinSCP to transfer their block, index and chainstate files and runs into any problems, here's what i did.
(I changed a hell of a lot of permissions here and just started over)
Rebuilt from scratch, but switched out the obvious commands for bitcoin_mainnet.
Ran bitcoind at the end of Chapter 7 of this guide and let bitcoind create the directories. Then, I waited 5-10 minutes, then stopped bitcoind.
Checked folder ownership in root and noticed that user 'bitcoin' owns these folders.
Just to make sure user 'bitcoin' permissions were on all these files when uploading from WinSPC, I added user 'bitcoin' to ssh settings by looking earlier in the article, when i did the same for root.
Signed into WinSCP under ssh 'bitcoin'. Navigated to folder /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet/blocks/index/. Deleted all files in /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet/blocks/index/ and uploaded the files from the index folder on my Windows PC. 
Did the same for /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet/chainstate. Then did the same for /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet/blocks.
Restarted bitcoind and I'm in business! Hope this helps someone out there!
