Probably at least one big investor sold up, and then panic set in with masses selling.
I expect bad news was the trigger, as the large investors tend to be very panicky with bad news, it also could be market manipulation as well which is something thats been around for decades in trading.
These large investors selling now will come back at some point when they believe the market has dipped enough, and then we will get another growth spurt.  The pattern is there to see.  Crypto coins are very spiky in value.
It stabilises when enough people are left to "hold out" vs the panic sellers, then when the big guys decide its bottomed out, they start buying again to initiate another spurt.

well I dont know on gdax/coinbase because their system is broken.
cant upload ID documents either on website or phone app.
I got setup on cex but the fees seem a bit insane close to 10% for trading.

not really, most banks in my country I can just show a utilitly bill and thats it account opened, no photo id, no video interviews, no tax id etc. needed.
Paypal, android pay, google pay, apple pay, samsung pay dont need any of this crap yet they all legal.
How the hell have people like randomware dev's managed to stay anonymous with all these checks.
I think they collecting documents to do identity fraud.
Also isnt bitcoin supposed to be a currency of the people and not tied to banks yet has more tracking than normal banks.
