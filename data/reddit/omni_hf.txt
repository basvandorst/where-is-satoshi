That's a terrible idea.  You'd see abuse of tax dollars. You're right that campaigns waste a ton of money but at least it's all donated.  We simply have to remove corporate donations and limit each citizens to a reasonable donation amount, like maybe $1000. Then you'd see smarter spending by campaigns.  It's Super Pacs that are the problem. It's corrupted the election system.

Bitfinex would need to meet and bribe the exchanges for this to happen. Also sets a very dangerous precedent so I hope it doesn't happen.

Not enough companies give API permissions or security options like IP locking. I know some pretty big companies that have excellent account security with ZERO api security. In other words if the API key is stolen the hacker can steal everything and do as they please with the account including changing credentials.  It's ridiculous.

My guess is that this is not related to Bitgo. Otherwise we'd see a lot of other exchanges and accounts dealing with a problem.  Keys were obtained and funds sent out.  The mistake was somewhere with Bitfinex policy on key security and utilizing Bitgo wallets with their system.

I think you're wrong when it comes to history.  Banks were created in order to store printed money securely and to interact with a financial system. Banks had vaults.  The entire point of cryptos is to have your own vault with your own keys locked security. Thieves don't even know you have BTC.  
Storing bulk BTC in an exchange is a terrible idea because it's NOT a bank and it is not insured.  
Use exchanges to exchange, which is their intended usage. Do not store BTC on an exchange. That's what wallets are for.

"no one is above the law"...stating the obvious and yet Clinton isn't arrested yet.
"Providers of communications services and products should protect United States persons’ privacy with strong data security while still complying with court orders and other legal requirements."
What a crock of crap.  You can't have both.  The real security you can offer customers and clients is the same security that the government wants you to weaken or even disable strictly for them.  They want it both ways.  This is like asking that mothers only have male children with one testicle.  Just F'n dumb.

I have ordered from them too at least 5 times.  They take forever to ship but eventually they do ship. Their in-stock items are not really in-stock imho. I bet they order their stock only after they get an order.  The average ship time was 3-4 weeks for most of my orders. btw...a better company is Provident Metals. They always ship within a few days and not once had any issue. Plus they have a much larger selection.

The fact that BU supporters can do this is the real threat.  You may feel disgusted that they are doing it but it's problem that they can. Imagine what would happen if a nation-state (China, Russia, even US) decided to disrupt the blockchain.  I don't personally support what BU supporters are doing but it's an obvious flaw in Bitcoin if it can happen.

Did that 3 days ago.  No response so far. But that's troubling that their tool doesn't work with the secondary password which they tout as "more secure."  
The "wallet password" opens up one key but then fails on the other.  So I know for a fact their recovery tool doesn't work with it.  If I use the Secondary Password I get an immediate fail.
People need to know that a wallet offering security and backup, doesn't actually offer backup and security.  You are their mercy if you have to rely on sending them a support ticket and wait for days or even weeks to get a response. That's if I even get one.
The Bitgo Recovery Tool does not work properly.  
@_date: 2017-01-16 20:35:20
Yes, I see that's because it was the original default account wallet.  I just created a new Bitgo account to confirm that by default the initial wallet is a keyternal secured wallet.  That sort of stinks you don't immediately get the option to decide how to secure the keys.  
I suppose I can test the recovery procedures of keyternal now.
Thanks for the responses. Maybe it will help other Reddit users.

Coinbase is worse than Paypal at this point.  Just because they are a Bitcoin related company does not mean it's run with the intent of freedom that Bitcoin is meant to pursue. Coinbase actually does the opposite by constantly trying to appease regulators instead of fighting them for change.  Having a Coinbase Bitcoin wallet only serves to empower them to continue stomping on your freedoms.

But people don't have global agreement on standards of living, education, politics, or religion.  Connecting people all over the world has so far only created global conflict. You can't expect people with entirely different cultures and mindsets to behave as you do.  You think like a liberal where the fix is to spread Western philosophy everywhere.  ISIS is a good example of the vigor for rejection of Western ideals.

Not a shock.  I'm waiting for Paypal to buy Coinbase.  They may as well since they behave in the same exact way.  Coinbase is going to destroy Bitcoin if this continues. They are not doing the overall community a service. They are inviting regulation and they just don't get it.  WE DON'T WANT REGULATION.  Coinbase doesn't do one thing to fight against over-regulation by government. It sees government as a friend that will help to get rid of competition that can't afford regulation.
I encourage anyone with a Coinbase account to close it asap and use another service.  We must as a community show Coinbase that they we will not accept them or their policies any longer.

I'd write back saying that you're happy to make a final withdrawal and discontinue using their service and that you don't see the need for your privacy to be invaded in such a manner.   See if they'll let you withdraw and close the account and you agree to stop using their service.  Let them know that if they refuse to allow you the withdrawal you'll have to consider legal action.

I read as much of the AML/KYC documents as I can find.  I dare you or anyone to refute my statement that companies are not required by the government to close accounts or seize funds.  Closing accounts is something they do because of their TOS/AUP.  Reporting potential money laundering is the main goals of AML/KYC and to seize funds would be paramount to the loss of a legal due process.  
Paypal lost a class action related to seizing funds and closing accounts.  Eventually so will Bitfinex if they continue. Most of these exchanges know this too that's why almost always they simply allow the BTC withdrawal then close the account.
I don't know your exact circumstance. I think Bitfinex is gambling that you won't create a legal hassle because they think you're doing something illegal.  In which case maybe you're screwed.

I think unless Paypal makes a direct push themselves towards Bitcoin that any PP business dealings with Bitcoin will eventually result in a closed account. I had my account since the 90's.  I wasn't even doing MTB with Bitcoin. But I was accepting Bitcoin along with Paypal and I was closed simply because of association.  I did millions worth of sales through Paypal over nearly 20 years.  After deep investigation and pressing them why the account was closed they only came up with that they were confused about my product and service.  I was just too much risk and that risk was only because I was involved with Bitcoin payments.  They had no other reason. No solid evidence of a single TOS/AUP violation, which I didn't violate btw.
Ultimately my business model is now 100% cryptocurrency and it's working out very well.  
If you're going to rely on Paypal you will eventually find out how bad of any idea that was.  Lose Paypal forever.

AML/KYC says nothing about seizing funds or freezing accounts.  That's up to the government. Your role is to report.  Legally you can close his account, return his funds, and report the activity.  If your claim is that these funds were illegally obtained and you're just making a stance based on that then it's your decision to do so and you're not compelled by AML/KYC to seize the funds on behalf of law enforcement.  
Saying that, do I think you should give him the funds?  Maybe not.  That's your call.  But it should be known that hiding behind AML/KYC is wrong.  Just use your own ToS/AUP in that case.
My issue is that you allow an account to be opened and used and afterwards ask for identity verification.  That's not cool.  If you're going to do that you will eventually face class-action suits.  You should be immediately asking for documents if you're going to freeze funds deposited.   Sounds like these funds are fraudulent and possibly stolen.  Might be a good thing that Bitfinex doesn't allow the withdrawal but it should be reviewing their policies concerning these situations.

I wonder how fast Coinbase or Circle will close an account related to payments of dispensaries?  At this point dirty addresses are being marked and flagged by major Bitcoin companies.  Then any related transactions get flagged for potential problems.  And lastly, your account is closed without any real reason. Even worse you could get a payment from a friend who got the payment related to a flag address and now you're closed too.  That's honestly how Coinbase is operating now.

I actually worry about these attacks not because the Bitcoin network is stressed and slow but because I think someone is trying to influence the direction of Bitcoin by using these attacks. That's a sort of blackmail imho. One has to wonder what their agenda truly is.  And even more odd is that some of these attacks have coincided with price increases.  Miners of course make more money from TXN fees too.  We already saw ETH fall apart because of a fork.  I don't think BTC needs that kind of a problem.

You forgot a huge one. For merchants you get lower fees and ZERO reversals from fraud.  That's huge because the economy builds into costs about 2-3% of all sales for fraud and processing fees. You lower that to maybe .5% and you just fixed the American economy growth rate.

Same here. Moved all my BTC from Coinbase but took some time (1-2 hours) for them to show in the blockchain.  Honestly something isn't right at the moment.  The amount of Unconfirmed TXN's in the network are not that high. Also there appears to be a drop in BTC price right now. No idea what's happening but this is not normal activity.
