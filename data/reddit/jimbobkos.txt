Futures don’t manipulate spot price. They’re a side bet of the actual asset, which means it’s a sentiment indicator of the asset rather than a fundamental influencer. Derivatives from CBOE are settled with cash and don’t involve any actual bitcoin transactions. This is different to actual manipulation like washing to create fake volume of actual asset transactions. The excessive selling pressures of the actual asset (bitcoin in this example) in Jan started the downfall. Not side bets on an asset from CBOE.

So the only reason which the 2017 bullring happened was because of huge fresh liquidity from FOMO, that’s the only way 50x to 100x growth can ever be obtained. In order to get that again, you need another wave of liquidity, which would’ve have come from insto investors.

“I’m not financially motivated by the tech”...... but I’ll buy low and sell high. And you just believe some one when they said they sold at the absolute peak of the valuation. Rid the internet of this pathetic article. Move on.

When you buy futures (long or short) you’re just making a bet with someone that X will occur and the other party of the futures is betting that X won’t occur. That’s why the derivative market is so huge because you can have unlimited contracts one asset. The herding of short futures means that people try to influence negative sentiment “that a lot of people think its gonna go down” to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. It has no direct impact on the actual order books, it’s just an indirect impact (that may or may not payoff). If it payoffs off then people go on to exchanges and accumulate at the price once it has spiralled down. The price of BTC was exponential in dec 2017, people had to take profits and those that were too greedy then tried to quickly sell off to capture what profits they could, amplifying the spiral.

Canadian government buying bitcoin. Are you simple?
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:32:07
I think it can but it’s still decentralised/needing you’re on involvement and skill to manage, ie. needing knowledge of crypto/wallets. Where traditional investors can rely on custodians of the ETF, thereby frog-leaping over the knowledge barrier and also trusting the security of a custodian. I know that gets back into centralised land but that’s the only way these big fish will want to enter.

@_date: 2019-01-24 15:17:31
Traditional investors are bound by KYC Laws, they won’t invest in anything that may compromise that, of which crypto poses a big risk to KYC given it’s anonymity. So you can kiss goodbye any liquidity that would pour in from insto investors. Also those “1% of total gold value” valuation techniques that crypto maximalist throw around are also out the window too.

This is one of many idiotic numeric comparatives the crypto folk comes up with.
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:06:06
Good response. This is likely to happen. Counter argument is that market enters a low growth environment, such that investors seek growth else where, which could lead to either riskier stocks or riskier assets altogether (btc).
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:35:29
So you’re happy with supporting the philosophy of btc at the expense of a financial loss? Yeah GBTC is similar to Pantera’s Btc trust, they are a little less liquid than what I assume an ETF would be (can sell units in Pantera between 30 days, whilst an ETF would be T+2 days)

The ETF should be structured whereby the investment vehicle (unit trust) carries voting rights, this will prevent the ETF provider from having BTC control. Something to keep a look out for in these prospectus’ coming out.

I’m here for the money because Bitcoin won’t destroy banks it will work along side them. So you still gotta play the game. Capitalist power is difficult to unwind given where it’s now. So best to just make as money as you can whilst supporting a good strategy to reducing that capitalist power. I see bitcoin as the global hedge against sovereign risk. Until BTC finds fair value, it’s pointless assisting the unbanked given it’s not a store of value (yet). I believe it can be one day. So I’m gonna ride the money wave up to fair value.

CBOE’s futures introduction wasn’t the catalyst. Price was parabolic at that stage and was inevitable it would come down after people were taking profits and starting to see regulation crack down (ie. South Korea clamping down in Jan 2018 etc). Crypto ETF is the shining armour because it actually purchases BTC to store in a trust and taking liquidity out of the market. Take liquidity out and price skyrockets.
@_date: 2019-01-02 08:27:41
Thanks mate, like it. I’d assume it’s a bit cumbersome to open and close state channels but later iterations will make it smooth, ie as simple as a a wallet transfer (ie. coinbase). I’ve heard that there’s going to be state channel aggregators, can to speak to those?

@_date: 2019-01-28 03:01:25
No. An ETF provides a vehicle that is easy for traditional investors to invest in bitcoin rather than learning how to invest in a decentralised environment (wallets, keys etc.). If all you’re after is price increase in BTC, then you’d be incredibly eager to get an ETF approved.
@_date: 2018-12-30 05:24:43
Currently it is and I agree that there’s more speculation than a portfolio diversifier. My intention is to compare BTCs ultimate/intended objectives rather than its current, speculation as well as also noting that a drop in 80% value is not a store of value. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 04:44:18
Thanks mate, not intending on sounding like a toss but is there anything else that comes to mind that’s a little more aesthetically pleasing? I’d assume with all the tech geeks around that there could be something that has been created so far?

It can’t be digital cash yet though without being a store of value. Once price hits long term equilibrium, then it’ll be sufficient for digital cash. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 09:35:09
Can’t speak for all ETFs, but iShares Gold ETF is a share in the trust that holds physical gold (link to the SEC quarterly report reporting gold holdings value ( So not paper certificates but a equity claim of actual gold. This structure being an efficient way of holding gold bullion but not as safe as physical gold given thecounter party risk in ETFs.
Interesting to hear your views, seems consistent with the white paper of being peer to peer digital cash. Alternative crowd thought is that it’s becoming a “digital gold”, hence the comparison and potential substitute in portfolios as a hedge instead of actual gold (or gold exposures through ETFs)
