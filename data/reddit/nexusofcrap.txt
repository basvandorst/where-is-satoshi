They were reusing them more than twice. We don't know how long it had been going on before that Asian man tried to hijack an ER.

No need, they were already recycling them at the morgue before burning the bodies.

I was specifically thinking about the patients. If I was getting blackmailed, I would try and hack the system.  
They already killed them and recycled the hearts, remember the morgue guy was the ringleader. No reason to kill publicly if you don't have too.  It just looked to me like people were using those bitcoin USB-like sticks like the RFID pass key thingies.  
Oh well, at least they're using bitcoin.  :)

Sure you can. It is fractional down to eight decimal places. You can buy $20 worth if you want, you don't have to buy a whole coin.

Except that they refused to use the test net designed for that purpose because "it wouldn't make them money". So they were committing fraud.

I always viewed it as a deadman's switch.  Sure, you could automate, but that exposes the operation to the internet and to hackers.  Keeping it physical eliminates anyone hacking the system.  
As for the in-person pay offs.  I took that as a security thing too.  Make sure you know where/who the money is coming from. Maybe some physical security as well, ala RFID.

Neat idea.

Gold is extremely useful on its own. Easy to work, conductive, non-reactive, etc. Its properties are what give it value.
