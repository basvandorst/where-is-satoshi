So, on-line shopping cart software should never use well tried, tested and secure bitcoin payment plugins from third parties because people should not be using middle men to process bitcoin transactions for them.  They should only ever develop their own bitcoin payment systems to use on the shopping cart software, otherwise they are supporting the legacy financial system which bitcoin aims to replace.  
Gosh, I really do hope that bitcoin affectionardos actually take your advise and every single one of them implement their own payments systems, because that will make available so may flawed, buggy, insecure systems it will be glory days for hackers to insert their own code and steal bitcoin at an unprecedented rate. 
Wishful thinking though. Very few people will be stupid enough to take your advise and create their own payments system, and will continue to rely on third parties with many, many years of experience producing secure payment gateways for small businesses to use.  The few that do try and make their own, will have future funny stories to tell in the today I fucked up sub-reddit.

You really should educate yourself on how bitcoin works.  Your seed is YOUR private key and not controlled, owned or operated by any company or wallet.  There are wallets that don't provide you with the seed.  These are custodial wallets, that means the wallet belongs to someone else, and any bitcoin you deposit into a custodial wallet, is not your bitcoin, and the person/company that does have the seed, can take your bitcoin from you if they choose to do so.  Thankfully, you have used a wallet that has provided you with the seed, so you can use that seed to recover your bitcoin to another wallet..    
Use your seed to restore your bitcoin to another wallet.  I personally don't recommend a PC based wallet, because a PC can be too easily infected with keyloggers, or in the case of Electrum wallet, can be sent phishing messages directing the user to install a hacked version of the Electrum wallet that will steal your bitcoin.  What you need to do, is get yourself a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano, restore your seed onto that, and then you'll be much safer than using a PC wallet.

Correct. You can deposit $5 in btc into the channel after paying the $30 mining fee, and when fees drop below $5, you can close the channel and get your $5 back, minus the mining fee you'll need to pay again to close the channel and finalise the transaction on chain.  However, the longer you leave the $5 in the lightning channel to keep it open, you can collect fees from each user that uses you channel.  If you charge a 10 cent fee, once you've had 600 fee paying users use your channel, you'll have covered your costs and all fees after that are profit for you.  As long as someone isn't selling access to their channel for a single penny in fees, otherwise, you'll have to match their price and get 6000 users to use your channel to cover your costs.  It does mean that you can now collect fees for transactions that would otherwise go to the miners for ever if you keep the channel open.  With less fees going to the miners, it provides even more incentive to the miners to keep mining bitcoin to prove that they do truly believe in Bitcoin, and ther're not just mining to maximize profits.

It works though.  Stops people from buying round after round of drinks at the pub, racking up hundreds of dollars in very low fee Bitcoin payments, then doing a double spend wiith the Bitcoin when you get home later that night to reverse the transactions.  You get a night out with friends for the one time high miner fee it will cost you to do the double spend.  You can't do this trick with bch because of 0-conf.  Only Bitcoin, PayPal, MasterCard and Visa allow uses to cancell and reverse payments made hours, or even days before.  He'll, two months ago, I cancelled and reversed a Bitcoin payment that had been sitting in the mempool for two weeks un-confirmed because I was able to set such a low Bitcoin fee manually when I did the transaction.  You should go checkout the Craigslist forums.  The amount of sellers getting caught because they are being talked into accepting Bitcoin for the first time when they sell, then seeing the Bitcoin they've been paid vanish from their wallets hours later due to the buyer doing double spends using low, manual set fees for the initial transaction.  If those same Craigslist sellers took, well, anything other than Bitcoin, they would still have their money.  Bitcoin is fast becoming the Craigslist scammers favourite new tool.

The scaling issue is interesting.  With &lt;redacted&gt;, spamming the network is encouraged because the network is secured by transaction load. As the amount of transactions on the network increase, the number of transactions the network can process, increases at twice the rate of transaction growth.  And no fees because the fee is you must confirm two transactions, for each transaction you want to send.  This way, any currency transaction on the network is always for the exact amount for both parties.

Because it will cost you the same amount in on chain mining fees to open the channel regardless of the value you deposit because fees are for transaction size, not amounts.   If the max amount you want to transfer is $10 for the coffee and doughnuts you just bought, the $30 mining fee to open the channel makes your $10 coffee and doughnuts cost $40.  If you open the channel with a whole Bitcoin, the $30 mining fees will have little impact because you can now buy $10 coffee and doughnuts every day for 2000 days for your $30 mining fee. Near instant confirmation, penny fees and 7 years of coffee and doughnuts for one on chain $30 transaction of a single Bitcoin, this is the future every Bitcoin holder is waiting for.  To the moon!

He's not logging into a custodial wallet.  Some wallets also use a password to encrypt the local wallet.dat file.  When you update the wallet, or restore the wallet, you'll need the password for the encrypted wallet.dat file, as well as the seed.  If a user has forgotten the wallet.dat password, the seed can still be restored into a newly created wallet.dat to bypass the encrypted one with the lost password.  This is to protect users from having their wallet.dat file copied/stolen.  I'm pretty sure that every PC based wallet does this.  Lets face it, a PC wallet is about as insecure as a wallet can be. If the PC wallets wallet.dat file wasn't encrypted with a password, it would be like have a safe that could be easily carried away by a thief and forced open later.

Woohoo, double spend opportunity.  Spend from coinomi wallet using manual set fee so low it will never confirm.  Take goods home. Use coinomi seed with mycillum wallet.  Mycillum won't know about transaction sent from coinomi because it hasn't confirmed.  Spend all from mycillum wallet to another wallet with a high enough fee so the transaction confirms in the next block.  The original transaction sent from coinomi is now a double spend and will be dropped from the mempool automatically and it will disappear from the merchants wallet. Just make sure the goods you buy are worth more than the fee it will cost to have the mycillum transaction confirmed. So buy like a hundred plus dollars worth of goods at least.  Buy 500 bucks worth goods, and you can have them for the fifty dollar fee it will cost you to do this.

There are plenty of miners. The 1mb block size limits the amount of transactions that can be processed per block, and blocks are limited to around 1 every ten minutes. This means users must offer a high enough fee so that the miners will choose there transaction to process in the next block above everyone else.

It's going to cost you another $15 to send the payment.   So, out of the $46 you have, the most you'll be able to spend from that, is about $30, the rest will need to be paid in fees.  It's seems like you don't know that bitcoin is a store of value now, and can no longer be used for small transactions because of the high fees such as you're experiencing here.   Best advise I can give you is to just hold on to what ever bitcoin you have left as an investment, and use another payment method. Contact the person you're trying to buy from, and ask them what other payment methods they accept.  If they'll only take bitcoin, and you still want to obfuscate the transaction through a couple of wallets, buying $200 worth should enable you to send $60 after fees paid for the wallet to wallet transfers.

It's the difficulty adjustments.  Every time the difficulty goes up, the amount of blocks mined gets pulled back to the 6 per hour average the difficulty adjustments is designed to do.  This reduces the maximum amount of transactions that can be processed per hour, so most wallets increase the fees automatically to compensate. Some wallets may let you select a range of low, to priority fees, but they'll still all go up regardless, so the wallet can confirm the transaction within the number of blocks they are promising the user.   
The number of new users buying bitcoin for the first time, has increased exponentially, over the last six months, due to the media saturation bitcoin now receives.  And of course, only an idiot would ever leave their bitcoin on an exchange, they've all been told repeatedly.  So now you have record numbers of transactions, from record numbers of new users buying bitcoin for the first time, jamming the network to death transferring bitcoin off exchanges into personal wallets.  And then you have people wanting to transfer bitcoin onto the exchanges to sell to the newbies at the vastly inflated prices they've been paying lately.   
Because of the 1mb limit, bitcoin just can't handle this new load.  The current road map for bitcoin does not include any increase to this 1mb limit in the foreseeable future.  Choosing instead, to wait until Lightning Network has been fully developed, and can be deployed with a soft fork, because hard forks are evil.
This is why the fees are sky rocketing.  Five hundred thousand newbies buying hundreds or thousands worth of bitcoin for the first time, that's the spike, bubble, what ever you want to call it.  When those newbies discover that the hundred bucks of bitcoin they bought for themselves and their brother, there's only $20 bucks worth left after fees from splitting it into two wallets. they tell EVERYONE, what a scam bitcoin is.
Bitcoins price isn't falling because of some coordinated world wide conspiracy, the price is falling because of poor management decisions made by the people that control the core software.  
Fun Fact:  The best software solution, is almost never, the best management solution.

Well, obviously he doesn't.  Doesn't matter if there is only one PC mining, or a million PC's, there will still only ever be around one block every 10 minutes that will clear 1mb of transactions  from the mempool every 10minutes. To clear 100 mb of transactions, will take 100 blocks to be mined, each taking 10 minutes.  If there are 2mb worth of transactions being created on the network every 10 minutes, half of those transactions will never ever confirm.  If you want your transactions confirmed, you need to pay a higher fee than the thousands of other Bitcoin users that also want their transaction confirmed.

To accept $50 of btc from an exchange via LN, you would need to open a channel with an on chain transaction, spend the $50 so your channel is empty. You can then receive any amount up $50 into that channel.  
If you only spent $20 from the $50 you opened the channel with, then you can only receive a max amount of $20 into the channel.  The channel you open, can never hold more money than the amount the channel was opened with.
After you receive the $50 of btc you've purchased from the exchange into your lightning network channel,. You can't receive any more payments into that channel.  You can only spend the money from the channel, or close the channel, paying the network mining fee, to receive the actual btc into your normal btc wallet.

Segwit is patented technology you can use for payments rather than using the primary blockchain.  The secondary chain is offering discounted fees to encourage people to use it.  In the future, an instant confirmation payment system called Lightning Network with lower fees will operate on the secondary chain.  Like a pre-paid visa card, you'll deposit your bitcoin,  open a channel is the term,  into the LN system and pay for your coffee using your Lightning Network Wallet instead of your regular bitcoin wallet.  So, you transfer 1 btc into LN and pay the $10 fee.  And then spend the btc from lightning paying just a few cents in fees each time you buy coffee with LN, and you won't have to stand around waiting for confirmations. That's a much better system than just using the main chain don't you agree?

You agree to buy a gtx1080 for 0.1 btc.  You open a LN channel with your 0.1 btc and make the LN payment to the vendor LN address.  Vendor sends you the card. Upon receipt, you refuse to close the LN channel and release the funds to the vendor unless the vendor sends you 0.05 btc via the regular btc blockchain. If the vendor refuses, you keep the card you've paid for,  vendor can't get his money released from the LN channel.  Vendor sends you half your payment back as regular blockchain payment, hoping you'll now close the LN channel and the vendor can at least get half his money.  You laugh at the sucker and demand almost all of your money refunded to close the LN channel offering just a few pennies to the vendor instead.  While the vendor is decideing if a few pennies is better than nothing, you're enjoying your new card you bought for half price, and may soon be getting even more of your payment refunded.

From the lightning-wallet.com website: 
"Receiving Lightning funds:
Nothing can be received immediately after creating a new payment channel, as ‘room’ for incoming funds has to be made by spending some funds first. A payment channel can be thought of as a full bottle of water: in order to pour something in one first has to pour something out."

Try sending all the bitcoin in your wallet, to another wallet, with a really high, next block guaranteed, fee.  I'm talking like 150 sat per byte.  It is highly likely that you have an un-confirmed change transaction in your wallet, that forms part of the transaction you previously sent but, hasn't confirmed yet.   By sending all the bitcoin from your wallet, including the un-confirmed change transaction, a miner that accepts this new transaction with the high fee, will also need to confirm the early transaction as well.

The massive pump started with a 60mil short getting liquidated at BitMEX.  Being a short contract, the liquidator had to buy bitcoin at market rates, no matter how high that would push the price up, until the margin was covered.  As the price shoots up, arbitrage bots kick-in and start moving USDT/BTC between exchanges faster than a butterflies fart.  Almost all the trading/arbitrage you are seeing, is fully automated bot trading.  After the arbitrage bots have done their job, humans jump on the FOMO wagon, where another army of trading bots are waiting to scoop up the pocket money from the 'wanna get rich quick day traders'.

Email pre-dates DNS.  There was time when you would need to provide the routing yourself in the address, with each server the email would need to route through delimited by the "!" character.  And then you needed a hosts file that you had to maintain yourself, that listed IP addresses and their associated host names and gateways to could route to that host. Regularly updated hosts files of large organisations like universities were available to download via ftp that you could 'cat' into your hosts file.  The more entries you had in your hosts file, the shorter your email addresses could be, because they only had to route to a server that knew how to route to the final destination of the email.
So yes, sending email was once, super hard, and had a high number of bounced emails because of incorrect routing provided by the sender.  You could only write emails with a simple editor, called 'ed', and you would be using a dumb terminal like a VT220 connected to PDP-11 via a long serial cable that could run at a staggering 9600 bits per second.  And then there was VAX/VME.  Or better yet, having to convert an 8 bit ascii email from a DEC, to a 7 bit ebcdic file so it could be read on a piece of shit, IBM.  Fuck, I'm old.  Emails, like everything else on the internet at the time, was complicated. Telnet, gopher and ftp was how you used the internet.  The creation of the Domain Name System, that was the turning point for the internet that made it easier to use by everyone.  Still, it would be another 10 years until Tim Berners-Lee created a protocol that would give everyone a reason to use the internet.  
So, no, personal security today, is way easier than sending emails was in 1982.  Once upon a time, only people with computer science degree could send an email.

He did a clean install of windows 7 OEM, then plugged it into his home network, which connects directly to the internet.  He didn't wait for the laptop to auto update to the latest service pack and install all security patches,  then the full scan when completely updated.  He jumped straight in and used it to send bitcoin.  When he installed chrome, he now has a vulnerable early version of flash running on his computer as well.  That was always going to end badly.
Even the latest Linux iso, no matter which distro, is insecure after its installed until you've completed installing all security patches released after the iso was created.  An up to date android phone with electrum or mycillium wallet is far more secure than a fresh install of windows 7 or Linux.  Getting a fresh install of windows 7 updated and secure enough to use takes many hours.  And don't use Chrome.  Its built-in flash player is still vulnerable.  Chromium is the build that doesn't have flash player built in. Firefox, by default, also doesn't have flash player either.  An OEM version of Windows 7 with all the pre-installed bloatware included, is far more insecure than a regular windows iso direct from Microsoft.  If it is a Lenovo laptop OEM version,  just burn it.

As bitcoin must hard fork to implement this,  why not increase the block size at the same time?  Or hard fork now in preparation for Schnorr signatures.  Is a hard fork with concensus even possible because with the last couple of hard fork attempts,  hard forks were,  and still are,  painted as an attempts to destroy bitcoin that must never happen?

And their 0-conf multisig shit RBF confirmation service they offer to merchants isn't full seqwit so your transaction ends up burried with the rest is the legacy transactions and won't confirm with a low segwit fee anyway.

You forgot to mention how much money he makes from donations.  Just a few days ago, some idiot that created a new account on bitfinex using a vpn and deposited 30k worth of monero, donated 1 btc to him.  If you didn't read the post, said idiot sold all the monero for eth and then immediately tried to withdraw it.  Bitfinex stopped the withdraw until said idiot provides KYC details, which said idiot refuses to do. So, idiot compounds his lost monero, by giving this grifter 1 btc towards his (imaginary) legal defense against Bitfinex.  
And he has an army of followers, mostly wannabe daytraders that have lost money, and need to blame someone, or something for their own stupidity.  He points at tether as the reason, and takes donations to pay for lawyers, for a court case that doesn't exist.  Way down in his crap, he does even say that there isn't any legal action pending, or even being contemplated, but he's still taking the donations, just in case Bitfinex do decided to sue him one day.

All mobile wallets will have to pay routing fees for the foreseeable future because running a full lnd node on mobiles is currently not practical.  You could run your own node on a pc at home and link your android to that, but if your home node goes down for to long, you'll loose your money currently locked in any open channels.  You could pay to have a high reliability server in a data centre with redundant backups, but that would be way more expensive that just paying routing fees to a third party service like  ACINQ.    
Perhaps you can run a full LN node on your laptop and take your laptop with you when you go shopping so you can open channels directly with each retailer and avoid routing fees.  Take your laptop to a coffee shop and use the shops free wifi to connect your  laptops LN node to the internet.  Open a single-funded channel (the only type of channel the coffee shop allows) from your laptop directly to the coffee shop.  The minimum amount the coffee shop has set to open a funded channel is $20 worth of btc.  You create the btc transaction to fund the channel and set the  btc miner fee to priority so the transaction will get the 6  confirmations required before you will be able to use the channel.  Only $0.15 miner fee to guarantee next block confirmation, not to bad.  You wait half an hour to get the 6 confirmations required before you can use the new channel, taking in the wonderful smell of the freshly ground coffee wafting through the shop.  
Your btc transaction finally gets the required number of confirmations and your channel is now open.  You scoop up your laptop and approach the counter.  You order a $2 flat white in a mug.  The barista rings up the bill, and the LN QR code appears on the screen.  You swing your laptop around and aim the camera at the QR code.  You click OK on your wallet, and the sale is almost instantly confirmed.  You pickup your coffee, thank the barista, and return to your table.  You enjoy your coffee so much, you decide to buy another, and perhaps a piece of pie.  Again, the barista rings up the sale for $8 and the QR code appears.  You swing your laptop around, scan the QR code, sale is rejected for insufficient funds.  It seems the coffee shop as set the channel reserve at $15 to keep the channel open, leaving you only $5 of spendable credit.  You apologise to the barista, return to your table.  This time, you open a channel with $50 worth of btc.  Fee is still only fifteen cents, nice and cheap.  You wait for half and hour for the 6 confirmations, and finally, your new channel is open.  You return to the counter, scan the QR code, instant payment for zero fee.  Isn't LN great!  You take your cold cup of coffee and your piece of pie with the ice-cream now melted all over it, back to your table to enjoy.   As you sit marvelling at the congealed milk in your cold coffee, you post on reddit how you just bought pie and coffee using Lightning Network and paid zero fees and the payment was instant.

No, it's true.  Mobile Lightning Network wallets will have to rely on routing, and paying routing fees for the foreseeable future.  Battery life, and data restrictions pretty much makes the use of remote nodes mandatory for mobile lightning wallets. I use the Bitcoin Lightning Network mobile app and used it's recommended ACINQ node. The fees they charge to open a channel to the node are only $20, plus the fees they charge to backup my open channels so I don't lose money, are only a few cents for each backup. Still heaps less than the cost of running my own node.  Sure, ACINQ will be able to track every purchase made, or payment received, by every person that uses the mobile app, and they could sell that data to anyone. No one would ever know if they were or not, so why worry about it? It's still cheaper to pay their fees than buying a server and paying for the electricity 24/7 plus the internet connection costs to run your own node.  Unless your some kid running a node in your bedroom with mum and dad paying for the internet, electricity, and the server, running a node costs money.  Divide the true and full cost of running your own node each month by the number of Lightning transactions, and that is the true fee amount you're paying for each lightning transaction.  Or pay the routing fees to ACINQ if you're only going to be doing at most, a few hundred transactions a month.  Or do those same transactions on-chain using seqwit. They'll only cost a penny or two at most, they are quite cheap you know.  On-chain is simple and cheap when using seqwit.

You could have done that transaction on-chain for a $0.02 fee.  I bet your fifteen cent fee doesn't include the fee cost of opening the channel in the first place either.  Lightning fee is seven times more expensive than on-chain fees.   Set your LN node fee to &amp; in your config so you don't trigger alarms in wallets like Eclair and earn three bucks out of every hundred dollars that passes through your node.  The more btc you deposit into your node, the more traffic you'll be able to route because you'll be able to route very large payments, and earn three percent on every payment routed.  Explains why every man and his dog is rushing to setup a LN node.

What you're describing isn't leveraged margin trading.  You don't deposit 1 btc and use that as collateral to borrow 1 btc to short.  That would be pointless.  Why pay interest on a loan of 1 btc, when you could just sell the 1 btc if you thought the price was going to fall.  What these degenerate gamblers do is, they borrow 10 times, 20 times, 100 times more than the amount they've deposited.  So they don't sell  the1 btc they deposit, they borrow and sell 10 btc with the 1 btc they deposited being the collateral for the loan of 10btc.   
If you use 10x leverage on your 1k deposit, you would buy 10k in short contracts.  But, the price of btc goes up by 10% instead of down, so, you know owe 11k. At this point, the software will now have to dump your $1100 of btc collateral on the market to pay back the person you borrowed the 10k from, because you now owe 11k and you don't have enough collateral to cover the debt if it were to go any higher.  To avoid having your original 1k btc liquidated, you could instead deposit another 1k in btc, which would now cover your debt up to almost 12k, and you'd be hoping that the price would turn and start coming down again before that.   People get caught because the don't use a high enough fee, and their btc deposit doesn't get the 6 confirmations it needs before it gets credited to their account and it gets liquidated.  Or, the accept the loss, and just say goodbye to their 1k deposit.  
BitMEX doesn't take USD deposits, only btc, and all settlements are done in btc as well.  So, if you deposit $1000 worth of btc, and you are lucky and win, taking your balance to $5000, you don't get to withdraw that 5k in cash.  If you want to withdraw it, you'll get $5000 in btc.  
Leveraged trading at 10x, means you get 10 times the amount of profit you would have made with out leverage.  But, it only takes a 10% swing against you, for you to loose it all.
