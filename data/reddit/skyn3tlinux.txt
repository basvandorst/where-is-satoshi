Thank you. Im so sorry about your aunt. :(
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:38:56
Thanks! I plan on it!
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:41:45
No. Without mining coins i would never have been able to convert ANYTHING into usd to pay for it. I cant mine dollars i can mine bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:50:43
While i see your point. Although i wasnt asking for tips i dont take $0.03 as disrespectful im happy someone was thoughtful enough to even go through that process. Any anyone who has ever fought or paid for fighting cancer they will attest every 3 cents really does count.
I do thank you and value your statement. Honestly i do and in alot of cases i agree.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:16:50
I see your point. Just today isnt the day for me to try and sort out whos a shill/troll/douche. Btcfuturemoney already made me feel like shit today so ill just stay away from any comments like that one
@_date: 2014-11-30 17:29:08
Thank god. Lol
@_date: 2014-11-27 06:57:27
Made it 4 years fighting this horrible horrible cancer. He was a tough old bastard ill tell ya that!
@_date: 2014-11-28 01:36:58
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:48:36
Unless he actually states he created it the point isnt valid. Ita just a witchhunt like with dorian, and szabo, etc.... You will never undeniably prove it was him unless he says so. Everything else is just circumstantial and speculation.
@_date: 2014-11-29 05:40:17
Author sounds just a TAD BIT jaded, no legitimate explanation of the blockchain. breaking down the aspects of bitcoin without including the blockchain is like talking about cars without mentioning the engines that run them.
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:44:27
exchanges use cold storage for the majority of their coins. they have hotwallets setup that payout upon withdrawl requests, when the hot wallets get depleted they have to move coins from cold storage to the hotwallets which causes a delay in withdrawls.
for instance:
I used to mine using ghash, on almost a weekly basis i would process a manual withdrawl for one reason or another and I would click the confirmation email, ghash would come up with "error insufficient funds"..... wtf? you just told me i had 3 coins, i withdrew 1...whats going on?!?!
emailed ghash they confirmed this is what happened. offered no solution other than, try try try again....in 30 minutes...or so. annoying AF. ive experienced the same issue with almost every pool and exchange. 
except for bittrex for some reason, then again i use it mainly  for altcoins so that could have an effect.
hope this helps
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:02:30
Wow did i not say that i was not looking for tips? Did i not update the post saying ALL tips including my OWN money will be put dirextly towards other myeloma families?...guess theres always one person whos gotta be a douche. I will NOT collect one cent for myself. 
I pad for his chemo for 6 months with my bitcoins. Do you honestly think what i need is more bitcoin? OBVIOUSLY if i paid for chemo for 6 months ive got plenty of them.
What a dick. Happy Thanksgiving. I honestly hope you never know what it feels to habe your dad die just for some jerk like you to say something rude.

Bitcoin is basically on sale right now :)
that being said....
HALF of your savings..... if you are in a position in life that requires you to save, then play it smart.
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:01:04
Fixed. Spelled it on my phone wrong 1 time and its been saved ever since.
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:19:21
Unfortunately had to convert it to fiat. Drug companies arent too keen on bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2014-11-28 00:20:47
He was an old school fiat believer. He had a hard time understanding paypal. Let alone bitcoin. People have a tendency to not like what they dont understand. It was always "imaginary money" to him. It took me converting my "imaginary money" that i "made with some machine" to make him realize that bitcoin itself has value. I never told him before that i was paying his bills with it. It was in that last couple hours with him that i explained it.
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:00:02
True, unfortunatly the systems just arent in place for hospitals and cancer specialists to accept bitcoin. If they did i would habe paid btc directly.
Fact remains had i not been able to mine bitcoins in the fashion i did anf hold so many from btc was so cheap. (The good ol days heh) then i could have sold every single possesion and worked 3 jobs and still never been able to pay his bills.
Reguardless of the fiat it was exchanged into. Had it not been for bitcoin i wouldnt have been able to afford it. Plain and simple.
@_date: 2014-11-30 12:05:48
Somebodys bot does...   Willy was the bot on mt. Gox that allegedly caused the $1,000 rush.
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:46:51
I can see that argument. But chances are if it didnt do it at $1,000 hes not doing it anytime soon.  I highly doubt that someone who went through THAT much trouble to create bitcoin for the reasons he stated for him to just dump it all and ruin it.  I guess nobody really knows. But unmasking him is not going to help the situation at all. Besides most likely get him harrased and or hurt.
If it were me and i got unmasked. Id fear for my life and dump everything rather quickly.....careful what you ask for, might have unintended consequences.
@_date: 2014-11-27 06:50:51
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:22:52
And you believe you know his religious stance and beliefs based on what? 
Thought so. Happy thanksgiving.
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:11:27
you could always use a bitcoin ATM....they even have higher limits than the average $400 from a bank ATM.  (if they have a bitcoin ATM in your area that is)
I use them all the time if I need cash but since I pay for everything including diapers with bitcoin via gyft and other services gas is one of the few things I actually use cash for still....for now
@_date: 2014-12-28 06:23:20
what do you mean by failed attempt? Ive used it like a hundred times and never had it fall through. (unless your mentioning buying stuff on darkmarkets etc...)
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:07:52
Funeral home just picked him up. Im not collecting any tips or anything until torrow when we can come to a concensus on the best method to help myeloma fighters and family with said tips.  Thank ypu everyone. Suggestions on how to do so are greatly appreciated!!
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:21:36
Would you pm me please? I habe so many friends in the myeloma community now. Anyt wisdom or insight you may have i would live to hear and maybe even pass along to the others I know fighting this.
@_date: 2014-11-29 03:00:29
UGH.....uber, why you no take bitcoin?!?!?!?! I use it constantly it pisses me off everytime i have to use google walet (bastards are tracking me everywhere I go)
that being said, I agree with you whole heartedly, bitcoin is cool, bitcoin is great, bitcoin is awesome, it will always have aplace in my heart, but the true beauty of the machine is the blockchain and the irreversible good it can and will do for humanity...if we would just let it :) 
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:19:21
@_date: 2014-11-27 06:55:54
I wasnt looking for tips. But thank you. Ill collect tomorrow and tip it to the needy. Whats the best moat active cancer sub? I think ill start tipping there on my own.
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:31:21
Thank you! Ive decided that every tip that comes throygh will be spread to r/myoloma....preach the bitcoin gospel and help those in the fight! Would anyone mind dearly crosslinking this to the myoloma sub? That way tomorrow maybe they wont be so surprised with the tip bombs i send out.
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:21:00
Chargeback with bitcoin....LOL
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:31:15
I wonder when people will start realizing that most of us dont care to know who satoshi is.
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:26:07
ohhh. you mean like they gave banksworstfear a tip or something for writing about them?
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:26:57
Holy cow theres an r/myoloma!    Mad tips coming their way tomorrow watch! Thank you
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:45:49
True. How about this. Im going to update the op asking for the best method for helping donate/tip. Tomorrow ill see what everyone decides and we can go from there.
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:10:29
Im thankful for Satoshi Nakamoto, Hal Finney, and every single person who has ever used bitcoin in a way that helps progress the technology and the people supporting it.
Banks have had a stranglehold on the people for too long. Its about time we made a change.
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:36:40
Amen brother. Amen.
@_date: 2014-08-29 18:43:09
Claims they write for Banksworstfear.com 
found their articles:
l'm no blockchain explorer so someone else will have to follow the coins if you really wanna find out. Not sure its going to cold storage though...coins keep moving through multiple wallets.
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:55:18
yup, ghash is the worst. btcguild has been pretty reliable with withdrawl time although in some instances i've waited an hour or so. plus i dont know about you OP but it is HIGHLY advised not to store the majority of your coins in ANY online medium. then again from rereading the post looks like you bought coins on bitstamp with the direct intent to buy something online. in that case disreguard....
but then again.....dont disreguard because it's good advise.
@_date: 2014-11-28 03:32:04
Thanks! Ill give them a call asap and see if they have any suggestions on talking to the foundation for accepting donations.
@_date: 2014-11-30 11:21:43
I really cant make heads or tails of this. Can you ELI5 like im a 5 year old please?
@_date: 2014-11-29 15:33:50
Transferring your funds to cold storage is your best bet if its any significant amount of money to you that you dont spend on a regular basis.  That being said. It is up to you to decide how deep of cold storage you want to go with. Just know it is always HIGHLY advised against to trust your coins with ANY 3rd party.
@_date: 2014-08-29 18:02:10

@_date: 2014-11-29 16:02:59
Amen brother.  Dont forget to keep antivirus and anti malware software up to date. Keep good online practices. Dont use your computer to buy and sell bitcoins and watch porn at the same time. Try to keep that stuff seperate.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:48:51
Wow man. Thanks. Real classy of you.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:35:12
I totally understand but if you knew my dad you would see. He was a TOTAL bitcojn HATER at first a year ago. Then once he found out i was paying his treatments in money converted directly from bitcoin proceeds. His whole attitute changed.  And he understood what bitcoin can really do.
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:39:25
let me get this straight.
I can get a Robocoin ATM for $0
AFTER I pay you $4,000?
...smh, silly guy.
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:42:16
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That meams so much! Did he have myoloma too?
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:03:21
None at least not in his case. He went from the mayo clinic in az. To the UAMS center in arkansas. I convertted bitcoin on a weekly basis and paid in cash.
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:12:41
Fuckin math, wins everytime.

YES! I remember reading about it. If anyone finds the link before me please post.
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:29:46
You said right there. Ive bought alot of CRAP with bitcoin. But if i never see another bitcoin again im happy just knowing that yes without it i qould have NEVER been able to pay anything for the last 6 months.
And who says you cant buy important things with bitcoin?
Just smiled for the first time in 3 days. Thank you for that
@_date: 2014-11-28 00:24:08
I emailed bitpay at the same time i emailed the myeloma research foundation. Trying to act as a medium to connect the two. 
Thank you for the suggestion its looking like the myeloma research foundation will be the place the money goes to. I am not claiming any tips or donations until the myeloma foundation has a direct way for us to donate. If it means i have to convert to paypal or using a prepiad credit card so be it. 
If you or anyone has any experience in getting charities or other entities to accept btc donations im asking for your help in any way.
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:45:44
Aaaaaaaaaahahahahhahahahahahah. I needed that. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-08-29 17:52:08
yea. the only one ive used it bitplastic and it works. site looked like a scam tbh, but it worked. cant vouch for buying or selling or ecahnging or anytihng on there. but the regular bitcoin card works. (not a visa though, its an Mbank card from poland , mastercard lol) EXACT same cards and limits as the ANXbtc.com card except its more $ because its anonymous......hope that helped.

Stay strong and keep living!

In his case he got a sever vitamin B deficiency because of a new treatment he was on. Sadly vitamin B levels are not by default measured as a base line. My dad refused to be on machines. They gave him a phenntynol patch and some adavan and he fell asleep for a few hours until he finally just stopped breathing. I like to velieve it wasnt painful. So in his case the cancer didnt get him per se. (It usually doesnt) its always something simple thats a result of the cancer.
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:15:52
reading through your list. I would actually like to get "the promise" by Pearl s buck. sending you a PM now

That just made my brain melt. Good job though!
@_date: 2014-09-13 04:01:28
he tends to be pretty slow about things. but it does in fact work. do you have any links about him being a scammer? i tried his btc to virtual visa thing and it took 2 days, I didnt like that so he gave me a refund, but he DID in fact give me a refund. doesnt mean hes not a scammer I guess.
 if you dont care about the card having your real name then just use ANXBTC they are the real thing and I have 5 of their cards. just know that that card is not anonymous.
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:43:02
Thank you i havent had a chance to look i read it wrong and assumed it existed.
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:18:10
You didnt answer my question :p
Reguardless, if a company clearly says in their refund policy that they do not refund bitcoin. And then you pay with bitcoin, then get mad because they wont refund you...wel...whos fault is that?  They operate a business and although not refunding bitcoin is stupid as far as im concerned as well. It is ENTIRELY up to them to choose to do so (hence the refund policy) just like it is ENTIRELY your choice to use them or not.  
Your arguement is like saying ill never use a car again because i didnt read the contract and they wont let me return it for a full refund.
Dont get me i wrong I AGREE whole heartedly that its stupid and unethical to offer payment options but pick and choose how you refund.  But on the same note. It is your responsibility as a consumer to know the terms of the service before you use it.
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:06:02
First issue. Could be adware/spyware/trojan/keylogger. 
Second issue. Dude you are totally right. Took me a second to realize the i vs. L issue. Scary how rediculously careful we must be.
For now i suggest moving your coins to offline cold storage away from blockchain.info at least until you can get the issue sorted out with your computer and or why your coins are getting jacked
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:11:00
Holy crap! I tried for a year on the same cube. Never got it. I guess im just dumb! Lol. Good stuff man. I give serious credit to you.

that street goes both ways. happy thanksgiving &lt;3
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:20:59
while i agree in kens case there really is no such thing as bad publicity and all the discussions are doing is making him bigger in google.  Its def. not ALL r/bitcoin is about.
hodl your coins, keep the faith, were not all dicks.

Ahhhh solutions guide. Like a cliffs notes for the cube. Now im debating challenging myself. Very cool man. Very cool keep up the good work!

Thank you so much
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:37:54
You do maybe. But to alot of us de anonymizing bitcoins creator serves no real purpose. Its the technology behind it that makes it important. People start de anontmizing satoshi and then we get into political drama about the creator. And lose focus on the actual technology itself.
How does unmasking someone who gave you this thing called bitcoin and didnt want to be unmasked helping you in any way?
If you own bitcoin and benefit from it you should respect the wishes of the person who gave it to you.  dont bite the hand that feeds you.
Not being a dick, just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:16:32
Got me there, i misspelled the word allegedly and must have hit delete instead of tapping the corrected spelling.  Ive amended it. Calm down killer. Lol

Just an update. Ive spoken with the research foundation and they are willing to accept bitcoin for donations! Im now awaiting bitpay and all should be good to go. Once bitpay is integrated to the site (hopefully by monday) i will collect all tips and send them off to the foundation. I will imclude all transactions publicly so there is absolutely NO QUESTION on where the tips went.  
Thank you everyone for your love and support!
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:50:35
that is a very relative statement. also far more risky, not everyone likes going to jail bud. not to mention growing pot has nothing to do with the OP's question.
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:11:05
id be willing to bet some btc thats not it.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:05:34
I completely agree with the exception of those of us with the proper connections doing it purely for profit is not practical.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:30:03
depends on your location and personal preference, I have always preferred to buy in cash from local users, however you can buy from almost any exchange online with a credit card (verification needed). your coins are only as secure as you make them, dont watch porn all day then go buying and selling bitcoins on the same computer (unless you know what you are doing lol) 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:27:46
if your spending with vendors that use bitpay or the like, you "might" be contributing to the price everyone is complaining about...
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:39:43
how do you figure?
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:25:29
Cant speak for everyone obviously, but myself and collective sell only what we have to in order to cover overhead (electricity,security,etc..) we mitigate as much losses as possible by dabbling in altcoin trading and utilizing places like bitreserve helps tremendously in keeping some of our reserves stable against volatile days like the last few.
Locked in over 100btc at $350 in bitreserve. so im "somewhat shielded" from all the whining and complaining about price and massive subsequent dumps as a result.
basically we spread our coins around and try to prevent as much coin dumping as possible. We also pay in bitcoin whenever possible in our daily lives.
As far as process, the usual, a shit ton of mini sell orders trying not to undercut the market as much as possible while still getting the fiat we need.
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:38:36
which game?
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:18:06
Lmao, does that really look like a complaint? It was a question not a complaint. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:18:15
that was a nice breakdown. good job.
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:36:20
haha I meant that  geez, I would HOPE she is still your fiance! lmao. Congrats! and Bitcoin saves the day.....Nice!
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:38:33
lmao...reminds me of this
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:48:57
math. it's simple, if you have free power, you will gain profit from a miner, either your trolling or just very uninformed.
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:08:38
yup and "supposedly" they are launching an IPTV service...payable in btc of course :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:11:54
what do you mean by stress test phase?
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:25:33
maintenance or upgrades maybe? with as outspoken as amagi has been its hard for me to believe they would suspend payments (unless its a price issue) I emailed them to ask anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:23:31
Take preventarive measures. For example as soon as you get pulled iver, call non emergency (my neck of the wood its 311) let them know you are being pulled over and request they stay on the line because you fear for your safety. This will will at least give you a little bit of leverage.  Granted yes the cops and dispatcher are on the same team. But its alot harder for a cop to do uou wrong if a dispatcher hears you verbally ask for a commanding officer. (Not to mention it is recorded).....im not saying my advice is the best and im not saying there are not alternatives to the situation. I can inly speak from personal experience and share what has worked for me in the past. (Im from las vegas originally, cops shoot first and ask questions later out there) fear of police is a common issue out there and 311 is pretty well versed on those situations.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:16:22
lol I know i was just being a smartass :) I still like using Bitcoin and the Ideas behind it more than just some scummy bank letting me use when I want (if they feel like letting me)
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:30:18
idk but i sure mined and subsequently dumped a shit ton of paycoins for a couple days...made a killing lol.
I think those hashlets had an sha256 version, I know nothing more than that though.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:18:36
EDIT: and its only a matter of time before people figure out how to scam chip and pin. Bitcoin is still relatively solid in that dept.
doh!......    
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:47:21
lmao took the words right from my fingers.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:30:09
Or you could just use electrum...
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:45:34
can we see a picture of it?
Ive always thought of having a private key to a miltisig coldstorage wallet lazer etched in microprinting around the inside of the band and just load it FULL of btc. The wife would get a kick out of that :) ...when I find one lol.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:42:20
im not going to go into the full math on the subject (google is your friend)
math aside, it would be more advisable to punch oneself in the face than invest with BFL.
as far as cloud mining goes, stay away from it unless you know what your doing.
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:35:03
Wow dude. You are really something else.
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:00:53
so if you stole power and didn't have to pay for it. there's no way to make ROI? 
math is obviously not your friend lol.
jkjk don't take that to heart i get your point but the statement is entirely false
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:40:50
angry much?
....that being said, I get your point.
@_date: 2015-01-07 08:33:31
awww. it changed lol

ahh okay as long as they arent cashing out right after. (most bitpay customers recieve fiat, which means bitpay just dumps the coins to send them fiat) but more importantly you REBUY! so thanks for that. so many people dont understand the point of rebuying right after they spend if possible.

That has always been my stance. I have never once said that anyone would get rich just buying retail hardware and mining.
Koolaid is Koolaid man. fact of the matter is you can profit from mining it just requires, (as you so eloquently put it) "special factors".
As far as the whole "bits of a volatile commodity, blah blah blah" comment, that means little to me and is a rather relative statement which doesn't even apply to the question asked by the OP.  My entire venture was a gamble to begin with (I knew that and accepted that) I am doing just fine mining. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:56:54
Try r/bitcoinmining this questiin has been beaten to death, resurrected, then beat to death again.
To answer simply, unless youve got at LEAST 6 figures to invest dont expect a profit (unless you have free power) if you are wanting to do it just as a hobby or for fun then by all means go for it. More miners=more security. 
Bitmain is pretty much the industry standard as with spondoolies.

ummm...the op clearly stated his electricity was included in his rent then stated it is not monitored....maybe its both, pretty sure you should direct that statement towards him.
In defence, if power is included in rent and there is nothing that states you cant use more than a certain amount of power, then i dont see the reason to even care if it is monitored.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:46:05
without knowing your budget antminers are pretty much the industry standard nowadays, (price, reliability, power consumption) just make sure you use a calculator such as bitcoin wisdom, and come into this game knowing full on your not going to get rich unless you make a drastic investment. I see nothing wrong with helping secure and decentralize the network and making a small profit  a the same time.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:36:48
there are multiple servers you can get the source from instead of downloading the whole blockchain. you dont have to use electrums servers and you could even go as far as host the blockchain on one computer somewhere in the world you do care about then just point your electrum client to your server to refer to the blockchain when needed thus avoiding having to rely on someone else for a valid version of the blockchain
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:39:35
unfortunately Bitcoin has a lot of "know it all" types. who would rather bash on an idea they already have a preconcieved idea about rather than attempting to think out of the box. dont get discouraged keep your head up and just worry about bitcoin and what you can do to help it dont worry about others putting your ideas into place. if you get an idea try your best to put it into practice.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:58:46
I am taking into account the hardware cost, as I told him, it wont be anything worth quitting your job, and I do not know what his budget is, but for someone to blindly say no matter what you wont profit with free power is just wrong in my opinion. ( fact is you dont know his power constraints, you dont know his budget, you dont know his long term plans, and most importantly you dont know what the future holds for bitcoin) and NEITHER do I all we can do is give him the best most informed advise, but for people to just blindly say you cant profit mining bitcoin, period, is just a little over the top for my taste.
I get your analogy, yet for some reason i have this feeling plenty of houses have been built by people with that same outlook.

lol true. However if you cannot see the potential benefits of cloudmining given the proper window then that's okay. just keep hodling. 
im not defending cloudmining. and in general yes they are all fractional reserve ponzis at best. That does not negate the fact that there are methods of making money from them.
and as I said stay away unless you know what you are doing. if one has to ask the cloudhashing question to begin with then its not for them.

Electrum is good for low internet connectivity, yes the longer you go without opening a "full blockchain wallet" the longer it will take to update said walllet.

I get asked that question ALL the time. I simply tell them 3 things:
1. Great for remittance/sending money at little to no cost.
2. Vastly more secure and safe than traditional banking/credit card methods.
3. Many retailers tend to offer discounts for using Bitcoin vs. other payment methods. (this is the one that usually makes peoples ears perk up so I save it for last.)
Hope this helps!

@_date: 2015-01-01 07:04:33
"There are no individual miners making $30k+ per year, only Chinese mining farms make any real money"
simply not true.  
just because most individual miners live off residential power rates does not mean that some of us don't have deals in place to mitigate those costs. trust me there's individual miners still making a decent living, just because we aren't trying to run machines off the 10 available circuits in an apartment or something, in no way means there is no such thing as an individual miner making a living. while I agree that most mining is centralized to actual companies (a shame). saying there's no individual miners making 30k+ is just simply unfounded.
OP it would take a serious investment i wont lie, but there are plenty of ways to get yourself to:
 A) a state with low commercial power rates.
 B) buildings or facilities with access to large amounts of power that can be converted to a mining operation with minimal costs.
it takes a serious investment and an even more serious commitment, but anyone who says mining by yourself and turning a profit is impossible either did it wrong themselves and now just has a bad taste in their mouth, or just don't understand how to think out of the box enough.
I'm sure ill get downvoted to hell, but like i said this doesn't apply to those trying to just run a bunch of antminers in your basement or whatever. (OP if that was your intention then yea forget it, however if you were serious then yes there are ways)
Bitcoin mining as a lifestyle choice is not for the faint of heart. lol
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:35:10
unless you have an unusually large supply of power, it wont work well for you. it USED to be that free power=rich. now it's just not that simple. with the price and difficulty not only do you need cheap/free power you need a substantial amount of actual power. the average 125amp panel in a residence just wont cut it. run all the machines you want, free power=profit, just not enough to quit your job.
that being said, if you have free power then go for it, help the network and if you plan to hold your coins then someday in the future it will have all been worth it.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:52:18

@_date: 2015-01-01 07:44:47
Thank you, even if i end up operating at a loss someday I will continure to support the network for as long as it is needed. My belief in Bitcoin is a deep political one, but hey turning a profit and not having to punch a clock everyday is a big plus. (no disrespect, I dont collect changetips for personal gain) thank you very much for the thought though :) happy new years :)
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:55:32
bittersweet truth,  In  defence I believe mining rewards as a living are an unexpected but beneficial side effect, in your support yes you CAN make a living i.e. profit from it. most are just too focused on reading calculators and assuming everyone pays the same power rates and hardware rates as they do. for example when the BF3500 came out, everyone bitched about power consumption, yet I had one running no problem and I def. didn't spend 100k+ in order to be able to buy it.
its all about who you know not what you know. make your own luck OP don't let a bunch of random people on reddit tell you otherwise. make connections, meet people, and get yourself into positions that allow you access to the keys to doors most would not have because they don't make the legitimate effort farther than google or reddit comments. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:34:10
correct me if im wrong, but they are suspending cloud mining, as far as I know they havent said anything about actually turning off machines. (suspending cloud mining because everyone is throwing a fit and actually straight up turning off machines are two entirely different things) my guestimation, cloud mining being suspended just means they will oint the machines that were cloud hashing to themselves now instead of users who buy GH/s
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:06:10

lmao, do you honestly think that every miner on planet earth just buys retail machines at cost? While i will admit that 90% of miners think that the only option is to buy retail equipment at cost it simply not true. Then to say " companies that sell it a price that makes sense to not even bother mining themselves with it" is totally unfounded. if that were true then companies such as bitmain wouldnt have their own farms....knc actually did the opposite of your theory and STOPPED selling to the public. then to say "the falling price of this bear market will fuck you up"  as any reader of reddit knows, trying to act like you know what the price will do is just a waste of time. 
its one thing to advise the OP that there are major risks and that it might not pan out the way they hope and that it is generally advised against unless you are in a good position to do so .But to flat out say it cant be done and its pointless is just not true.
I guess we need to draw the line of what an "amateur" miner is.....its funny how everyone keeps assuming this guy is just wanting to buy antminers and put em in his moms basement. OP never stated he was doing this at home, and never stated he was on a limited budget.  
How about we all stop assuming that hes some minimum wage earning guy trying to make it rich with 1 antminer, and simply help answer the guys question....

network security, (some will argue the centralization angle, i think anything that makes money the way mining does is bound to face some sort of centralization, thats just how humans work.)
