That's sad to see

Also if you  introduce bitcoin to a friend tell them to not store in on a online wallet and make a encrypted backup of you offline wallet. Better buy a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger
@_date: 2016-04-06 21:56:54
You can buy one atm on OpenBazaar.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:24:17
US only. Meh. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:24:27
Thanks! I'm from Germany 
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:15:42
So am i doing it right if I install it on my smartphone, create a backup and import my backup into my Chrome extension (so I have a synced wallet on multiple devices)?
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:17:41
Maybe he thought he could steal some physical Bitcoins
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:14:46
Sehr geehrter Kunde,
vielen Dank für Ihre Nachricht.
Da uns in den letzten Tagen vermehrt Anmerkungen zur Bitcoinzahlung erreicht haben, arbeitet unsere IT Abteilung daran, diese Zahlungsmethode wieder auf unser Portal einzuführen.
Leider kann ich Ihnen zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine genauen Zeitangaben mitteilen, ich würde Sie daher bitten, sich noch etwas zu gedulden.
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:21:47
Will there be a app too, so I don't need my private keys on my mobile phone?
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:33:05
Schick schick! 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:58:15
Some good questions there. Just took the survey.
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:28:57
Thanks. Thats's the best way to explain it :) very easy to use!
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:41:52
So this commercial is really in US TV? 
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:47:24
Pheeew that's cool! 
Edit: I always see Visa or Mastercard as a sponsor for sport events in TV. This is such a kick in the Ass :D
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:39:40
Happy cake day! 
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:11:13
Bad news. To the moon!
@_date: 2014-12-17 12:31:58
I think it's a pretty nice online wallet for smartphones, if you don't want to care about your private keys etc. (for me of course only for small amounts)
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:48:24
And done. Thanks 
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:23:41
People should stop watching "the next big thing" Galaxy S 5000 shows and instead watch presentations like this.
@_date: 2014-01-18 10:12:04
I would but you can only pay with Bitcoin in US AFAIK
@_date: 2014-10-01 06:15:16
Android, but ATM I don't use a mobile wallet.
@_date: 2014-09-23 22:47:07
Steam? 
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:23:22
SMS with automatic recognition  would be better in this case
@_date: 2014-08-08 06:18:22
Not available in Germany. 
Edit: The video.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:11:08
Where is the ToTheMoonGuy?
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:12:45
I helped a friend 30 minutes ago. He was 1st place for about 30 minutes. So who of you was it? :-D 
@_date: 2014-09-21 11:18:14
Someone who is familiar with Bitcoin should know how to use VPN.
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:16:02

If I get a new phone with my old sim the first thing I have to do to use Authy is to enter my chosen password. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:11:37
Finally in Germany too. It's a really nice app. Anyone else have the problem that the QR code for receiving money is not displayed?
@_date: 2015-01-06 21:07:40
You just don't get your 2FA keys. If you encrypt Authy with a password it will ask you time by time for it and you can enter it optional just to manifest it in your head ☺
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:10:52
Go home David you're drunk.
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:49:29
Thanks all! :)
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:32:55
Haha exactly how I feel 
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:08:18
Aka cold wallet
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:13:32
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:26:28
I've ordered a Ledger HW1 last week, still waiting for it :-)
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:28:55
First our wallets, now our bitcoin wallets
@_date: 2016-02-07 19:16:27
Correct, get a hardware wallet like ledger wallet. It's very cheap
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:57:47
Thanks I will just wait a few more days. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:53:35
Nice gesture, thanks! 
@_date: 2015-03-16 09:47:50
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:25:42
I remember 2013 when I woke up and the price was 70$(?) more than the evening before. Man good old times :D
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:44:12
Free coins! Thanks, Welcome Bitcoin newbies
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:33:14


I think the solution I searched for is something like Trezor as it sounds pretty much bullet proof. But yeah you are right, it's a good idea to always have a cold storage. I'll have a look, thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-16 10:15:11
Sure! I'll send you a pm.
@_date: 2016-07-05 20:26:19
Thank you. Somehow now it works :)
@_date: 2016-07-17 21:35:35
I used it two times with sepa. It was super easy and the nice thing is I don't have to register anywhere  and it's decentralized. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 17:30:55
I tired it but it's not able to establish a Tor connection. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:46:01


Thanks, i also watched this video 
It looks just what I want, unfortunately it's a bit expensive for the amount I own... right now :)
@_date: 2016-07-05 19:49:41
Don't know. I also tried different VPN connections and it doesnt work
Edit: Somehow it works now
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:10:32
I saw some on Open Bazaar 
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:27:35
[Our next product will be the Ledger Blue and will be available Q4 2015](
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:37:37
I have the same problem 
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:16:06
Still less than 25% :P
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:41:58
Thanks, but I think I will wait for Ledger Wallet Proton. It looks promising.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:11:44
I installed [Bitcoin Paranoid]( so I would say yes.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:33:03
Awesome, I hope I can afford a nice mx-5 one day and pay it with Bitcoin :-) 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:11:52
Thanks, I appreciate!
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:21:49
Well, I have no printer :D
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:32:59
Good point, thanks.
