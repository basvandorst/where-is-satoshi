It's also a cultural thing, I think. 
Being an American, I'm used to a certain number of digits for certain goods. 400 for a PS4, for example. In Japan, [the PS4 will launch at 39,980 yen]( That's a HUGE number to me...never mind that the article quotes that to be $390.
Same thing with bitcoin. Having something be like 0.005 bitcoins is weird to me, whereas something being 5 mBTC is more "normal." When we go out to 0.00005 bitcoin, the issue is exacerbated even moreso.

Definitely a chikun.
Or maybe a coin with an "F" in it instead of the stylized "B" for btc
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:46:30
Exactly. I mean, if Bitcoin were valued that high, I might splurge on a 50K car. Priorities, I guess.

That must be nice. I have student loans at 8%, 6.8%...

Just going to say, I've had Bitcoins since the April bubble, but this is my first actual purchase with them. I guess I can call myself a "bitcoin user" now!

I saw the title and being the snarky person I am, I thought to myself "units!"
Was kinda correct.

Solar panels still cost money. The break even point for those is measured in years (5-10).

I believe you were trying/wanting to say "well thought through."

I love these weekend dips. Made 500 mBTC by converting some of my stash into USD at ~$1000 and re-buying at ~$700.

Corsair PSU from 2008 still rock solid. Love their stuff!

It's probably cheap out in the middle of nowhere, but the more hospitable/desirable areas will be more expensive.

I am afraid of a 51% attack on Turkeys. Thanksgiving is the solution, however. Widespread proliferation of turkey consumption will help stabilize the network.

Security through obscurity doesn't work in a sector like this. It's also not a confidence-builder for potential users.

Sounds like a business opportunity: booze for bitcoins!
Nah, as an Ohio resident with friends over the border, that's always been funny to me. They're amazed at something so novel as going to the grocery store and buying alcohol whenever they want here.

Or if you converted instantly to fiat, you lost "0%" of your sales.

Realize that this is out in the middle of nowhere, though.

They had to delay the premier of an episode recently because of this. They lost power I believe the day before and rendering or whatnot wasn't finished in time.
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:38:57
I agree. 
"Crashes" are a lot easier to stomach, however, when you bought in before record highs (i.e. before the $266 record, our recent &lt; $1000, etc). Being someone from the $266 days, seeing my little stash go from ~$1100/btc to $700/btc doesn't phase me as much.

[Nice try]( the proper abbreviation is kWh. Lowercase k for kilo, uppercase W for Watt, and lowercase h for hour. Don't play the semantics game. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:15:33
I would have at least sold a decent chunk. Pay off student loans, car. Buy a few toys...All of that maybe for ~100 BTC at that price.
