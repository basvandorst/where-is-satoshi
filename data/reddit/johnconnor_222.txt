Depending on which exchange you look at.  The ATH was breached on the vast majority of them.

We just went through the correction.  This is a continuation of the aggressive move now that the weak hands have been shaken out.

Who cares, just don't sell and you will be fine.  If your looking to buy then dollar cost average in and buy 20% today and another 20% in a few more days

Now is always a good time to buy.  We are hitting ATH's today.  So every single person who has ever bought Bitcoin and never sold it, is in the green.  Buy and hold aka HODL and don't be a bitch and let the market shake you out.  Buy and never sell, and like i said,  you'll be in the green in no time
