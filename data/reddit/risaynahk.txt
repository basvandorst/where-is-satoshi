I'm sorry. But I'm also new to this. For example in my country the guys at buysellbitco.in are earning by buying and selling bitcoins. That can be called a business.

As a guy who has worked is ass off for the last ten years and seen no improvement in his financial situation, I as a act of desperation and against the advise of Bitcoiners went ahead and invested the money I can't-afford-to-lose. The fun part is I invested when BTC was trading around $1100. I've already seen two crashes right after that. But I didn't panic sell. I have decided that if Bitcoin goes down, I am going down with it. Your post makes gives me hope and makes me happy.

Irrelevant, recently I read that BTCs are issued every 10 minutes. Who is issuing them? Isn't BTC decentralized? It's so confusing.

Only country I know is the Republic of Internetistan.
