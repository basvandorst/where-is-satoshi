This has everything to do with difficulty as the cost of mining is determined by how difficult it is to mine. When it is unprofitable, mining costs will come down together with the difficulty as people turn off their miners, until a new balance is found where it is always profitable to mine for someone.

Bitcoins potential is much more than countering hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is caused by much more than a trade war as well.

You're probably right that buying euro's is better, at this point. But if you look at adoption rates of bitcoin in  Turkey, you see that many or discovering it now. That must be the ones who can afford to save and speculate. They will likely win the most if and when bitcoin survives.

Just visited Istanbul, Turkey. As you know, the Lira is worth much less than say 2 months ago.
Some people who can afford to save money, can put that in bitcoin. Others simply can't. They will be left with nothing if their money keeps devaluating. Only growing the gap.
Bitcoin might save the rich, but the poor will remain poor. Unless you find a way to receive more bitcoin than you spend.

You mean a third party that ranks in extra fees? Take a look at what Bitpay and Btcpay offer for businesses. There are also many BTC debit cards.

Are there any contactless (NFC) mobile wallets yet? Which type of payment terminal would be able to accept these payments?

I'm seeing a boom in contactless payments with mobile phones lately: debit/credit card payments, public transport check-ins, getting drinks at festivals, ...
I love the evolution, as I need to pack less and less cards in my oldskool wallet. However, some coins are making contactless cards - why not skip the cards and go mobile-NFC all the way?
