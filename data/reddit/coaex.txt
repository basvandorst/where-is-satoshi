Thanks for your opinion. Actually, we are one of the Bitcoin merchants who had transacted over USD 500.000 and yesterday, we had to disable Bitcoin payments, along with other cryptocoins (as they are tied to BTC).

My biggest concern is being united in a crisis, having the involved parties to reach a consensus without any hidden agenda. (failed) Maybe, this would be achived by "blockchain voting" concept. Inspect Memorycoin code at github and possible several altcoins that uses "blockchain voting" but I'm not saying invest in it. Maybe, without a hard-fork, blockchain voting could be implemented in Bitcoin. I'm not so technically skilled in Bitcoin. That's just my theory.


Is it because we, as Bitcoin merchants, are trying to compete with giant merchants which uses PayPal, credit cards, bank transfers, etc? Please consider this in a global scale. I might speak in my own perspective here but Bitcoin made it possible for people living in rural areas to obtain "something shiny" without a fee or with a low fee. Same applies to any products/services, especially to products/services in micro-transaction value. Besides, I favor my customers than my profit and want them to save each of their well earned money.
Bitcoin is/was disruptive because of its low fees compared to banks. Do you like your bank or do you like to pay a fee to your bank? 
I don't..


Security measures and answer 


We use 0.0001 BTC fees when we need to. However, we don't exchange it for fiat currency every time, we sometimes hold. The last couple of transactions were made to test the network. (failed)

This is one of our hot wallet address. Verification of this address can be provided upon your request and when the Bitcoin network returns back to normal.

Price should be your last concern in a situation like this.

I accidentally did the same yesterday. Based on my past experiences, I guess yours will be confirmed within 6-8 hours.

Miner fee reminder is practically good in today's business as most Bitcoin users are technically skilled people (and adding/adjusting a fee is not rocket science) but I wouldn't say the same for the future. Average Joe may become below average in 10 years.

Also consider zero fee transaction rejections by the network - the unintentional "frauds":) If you accept zero confirmation, a customer may use zero fee and then, it's highly likely that the transaction is reversed back to the customer. Rejections happen after 72 hours. Take a look at Blockchain.info - there are around 24k unconfirmed transactions now. Operating in a highly risky bitcoin business field, we had to disable our payment processor for that reason. Once the network is stabilized, we will re-enable it but it's no good.
