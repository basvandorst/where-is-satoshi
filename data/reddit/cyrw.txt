one day it'll be easy to sell bitcoin to someone, because:
* they don't need a bank (at the start, I think curious 12 year olds maybe already have a bitcoin wallet and like using it - I learnt to use the net as a kid, people used to say kids were much better at using computers than most adults)
* they can buy stuff wherever they happen to be on the planet, without paying to change their money to a local currency
* they can pay for transactions online/offline with ease, no need to register for something extra, like paypal
* they don't need to get an nfc (or future tech) card for public transport, can just use bitcoin wallet
* no chance of being charged any bank fees for being overdrawn etc. But if you want similiar service, can enter into a smart contract and get something like that for your regular bills (except, you'll be able to shop around easily so the terms will be much better).
* similiar to ft-coin proposal, they can lend money to their government by locking bitcoin in a smart contract in exchange for future tax arrangement (rather than the government having to borrow from people other than "the people"
* they can use smart contracts to simplify processes like buying shares/a house/business etc
* they can easily donate to dozens of charities without filling out endless forms, there could be a site where you pay in an amount and then move some sliders around and select some causes and split your donation between a variety of causes
* openbazaar/similiar
* decentralized lending will mean instead of putting money in a savings account, you can lend to social enterprise/invest in businesses or your community, or a community in 3rd world
* no more pocket change/visiting the cashpoint (and possibly paying a fee for the priviledge; in some places you have the choice to pay, or travel further to find a machine that doesnt charge)
* no more trucks driving around carrying paper and coins to and from banks and businesses
developers will be free to develop amazing budgeting/saving tools to help people with their finances
* gold can go back to being used for beautiful jewellery, instead of having it's beauty wasted by being locked up tight in vaults for no-one to see. Same for diamonds etc, such a waste. And counterfeit gold will become a problem in the next 20 years anyway. As will counterfeit paper money (technology will make it very hard to make money that can't be reproduced for less than it's face value, it'll have to have a blockchain element to remain secure, and checking that it's not counterfeit will take too much time at the till, easier just to swipe phone.
* Easy to have a time lock on your money on your phone so people being robbed late at night will only have very small amount of "money" (crypto) that can be stolen
* multi-sig will solve problems with large thefts - already systems being developed that utilize existing fraud protection systems similiar to what the banks use; so that a transaction that looks suspicious will not be approved until some extra steps have been completed. And this won't take the person's custody of the funds away from them, because it can be overridden by that person retrieving their own key from a safe place (a safety deposit box/safe/encrypted file stored on storj/future tech, etc)
* Micropayments will make it easy to pay for content on the internet as you go along; I'd like to pay more for good content, and maybe have a browser plugin that pays a tiny levy when I arrive at a site, in exchange for not being served any advertising
But there is a lot of work yet to do. If you want it to happen, ask an open source bitcoin projects you're interested in if there's anything you can do to lend a hand. When you're in a small business and likely talking to someone who is in some position of authority, ask them if they accept bitcoin yet.
If you haven't bought any bitcoin yet, buy $10-20 worth and when you see a "bitcoin accepted here" sticker you'll be ready to go.
And if you're asking yourself, yeah but why do I care, will bitcoin really be that big a deal for me?
Take a look at  Our current system is broken. Our salaries/loans/savings are denominated in a currency that is being manipulated to the profit of the banks. Worse, because they're so important (and they are) to the economy carrying on running smoothly (too big to fail etc) if they make bets that lose, the government bail them out with YOUR MONEY. Bailouts:
Also, the current system allows massive amounts of regularly flow unnoticed overseas to tax havens. Taxes are a good thing, they pay for things like hospitals, schools, policing (I know some officers give them a bad name but in general, you'll be happy to know someone's got your back if something bad happens, and also, the alternative isn't pretty - as you see in less policed states like South American countries and African nations (not to say those countries aren't amazing).
Decentralization is gonna make this an interesting century, can't wait :). Quite fun to get involved too - I'm sure some people are going to make a lot of money what with how disruptive this is to such a valuable part of society (the money of society). And much like when everything started being made in China, and now Chinese factory workers are the ones who see how things work, and figure out how to make them better, because they're hands on, making stuff, it's the same with bitcoin, if you're hands on making stuff, things will just occur to you whilst you're thinking about it, and I think VC are quite hungry for bitcoin investments at the moment.
