It was a scam from the beginning. Their business model:
1. design ASIC bitcoin miners
2. fund R&amp;D and production by getting pre-paid orders for said miners
3. let miners mine like crazy until they have reached 90% of their economic end-of-life age, rake in even more money
4. let old miners go to the purchasers to appear legit
5. repeat cycle with next-gen
It's similar to the gold rush, but even better. In the gold rush, the sellers of equipment who got rich at least didn't compete digging.

If you imagine being them and without scruples, it's the best business model. It gives them money, but doesn't hurt their profit line. My impression is that they really don't want to sell miners, they rather prefer mining themselves. They do so only to raise cash and get rid of end-of-life units while making BTC more popular and stable.
You are invited to challenge this. I couldn't. Every other option doesn't make sense from a business point of view.
TL;DR: You don't give away the money printing press before it stops working.

 Are you the BFL lawyer? There's no need to prove anything. It's enough to point out that all alternative actions are worse from their point of view. We assume a rational motive here.


This is a wrong assumption. It's not about hardware sales being a profitable venture. It's about keeping the hardware as long as possible being **more** profitable. Think about it. There is no incentive to ship early - it's prepaid. But you make money each day you hold on. What would *any* rational person do?

Bitcoin is the Iridium satellite system of payments. Nobody needed it outside of the US because everywhere else the GSM systems were good enough.
Same here. Outside of the US, there are nationwide banking apps, less reliance on credit cards so direct transfers can't be blocked, no fees for transfers in the EU etc etc. The need for bitcoin is simply not there.

already mentioned transmission remote gui, I want to add that it not only has a utorrent-like UI but better, it also monitors remote **and local** transmission daemons.
I use it for 2 years now, can't be happier.
