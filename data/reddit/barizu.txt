I believe it's not deceptive. From my perspective, if BTC will get to $1.500 this year it will mean that the current trend is falling in the longer term. Before each year the yearly lows indicated the trend. We had positive extremes going really up and fluctuating A LOT! But all in all saw that BTC was going up. I know that someone might have purchased their BTW at 15k and now sees it as risk - great! By analyzing the yearly lows they can see where the long term trend is going. I'm not telling them "guys, long term trend is up, so keep the BTC until it will be 30k" - I'm saying that up until now it was steadily growing. That's a valuable info for many people who might decide to purchase BTC now-ish for approx 3k. At the same time, if the yearly lows will start showing the negative trend - that's signal for me that the long period of good time for BTC is now threaten. 
When investing, try to take into consideration info about the short term and long term trends - and make your own decision. Some traders earn fast, some of them are HODLing - I'm just showing my point of view here. From my perspective it's absolutely logical point to think through when investing in BTC. Especially now, when the price dropped relatively low. Keep the coin, or sell it - I don't care. Just look at the bigger picture as well.

If so, BTC still gained its value to compare to 2012, but I would be grateful if you could send me the source - I was looking for BTC historical price charts from last years to make sure that tweet is credible. According to my research, the lowest price in 2013 was 65,53 USD on July the 5th.

;) I'm almost 100% sure that Bitcoin and such kind of platforms will be fine and we could buy a lot of houses with our Bitcoins!

What do you mean by survivorship bias? That Bitcoin will be the only crypto on the market and all altcoins will collapse? I think that not all Atls will die, for sure at least some of them will survive on the cryptomarket.
