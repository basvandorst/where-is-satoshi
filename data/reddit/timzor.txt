How about NZ, im trading on igot, it works with NZ banks but the buy and sell prices arent the best. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:54:00
not aus but nz, im using igot.com, their prices are pretty high compared with market rate but seem to be the cheapest i can find.

Newbie here, can you explain the chart for me?
@_date: 2015-09-10 04:22:09
I dont think bernie has ever proposed a 90% tax rate. Hes talked about how it was around that in the 50s but its not a policy of his.

Link please or some other form of citation. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 05:11:24
He mentioned it once. Read about it here 
And he says its not too high, but doesn't suggest that he will enact that as a policy (which would kill his campaign dead).
A google search doesn't bring any other mentions of it.

@_date: 2015-02-21 13:05:31
