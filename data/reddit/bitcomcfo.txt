That, or people just don't care about bitcoin any more.

Yes, I am stupid for buying 700 coins, but not for cutting my losses and selling them.
@_date: 2014-11-22 07:47:22
What about the spread? Looks like there is no liquidity on anx

Enough with the bits nonsense already!

It is cheap for turbo props too. Heck you can't even get the cheapest new Cessna for less. Reason it's cheap is that it's extremely impractical. Needs 7000ft of runway to land, severely limiting where you can take it, all of them are registered experimental, meaning you can't fly it over populated areas, you need to file an annual program letter with the FAA, it's a fuel hog and the range is pitiful, it has no cargo capacity, not even for a briefcase, etc... It is, however, heaps of fun to take one shooting holes in the sky.

You are right! @_date: 2014-11-22 07:50:20
Agree with you except for the Proof of Burn. Nothing wrong with burning bitcoin!

Forget withdrawals since fees will have eaten up your balance long before. What about the deposits?

What would be the point of that? This device is meant for printing paper wallets for cold storage purposes.

Correct on the jet fuel and mx costs. Maintance is expensive because parts are no longer in production. The Saphir died? Gotta order a second L-39 from Romania to cannibalize for parts.

OK, in other words the % of bitcoin that have moved within the past 3 months has dropped precipitously compared to a year ago. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:25:49
How is this any better than a Electrum brain wallet?
@_date: 2014-11-23 03:56:05
Hmm, obviously you are wrong. Not much else to say to you.

I don't think this story has anything to do with a Brewery in Virginia. The big story is that Groupon's Breadcrumb platform apparently added Bitcoin as a payment method!

I wouldn't bother to show up once a month to air out the restroom for 200k a year. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:48:46
Not much dough needed. You can get a L-39 from Russa for a $100k. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:04:25
Satoshi himself abandoned bitcoin 3 years ago and moved on. Does that not tell you *anything*?
@_date: 2014-11-23 03:54:59
Like I said, I was initially hopeful, and it took me a while to realize the truth about bitcoin. Would you not be so negative if you had the same experience as I did?
@_date: 2014-11-09 11:30:10
This. 10 bits @_date: 2014-07-08 01:50:22
Uhm, no, not illegal. Structuring is something unrelated. It only applies to bank deposits (not withdrawals) that try to avoid the banks reporting requirement for deposits over $10k. Nothing to do with some dude's arbitrary, undocumented, $3k cutoff for having to submit a palmscan.

Coinbase really shouldn't be supporting firstbits...

This guy is nuts 
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:55:48
Shut up troll. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:23:11
The level of delusion of grandeur on this sub never ceases to amaze me. Does anyone here really think Western Union cares about bitcoin?
