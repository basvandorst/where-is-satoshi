Lagarde can't be happy about this.

Well put. This stinks.
Either a covert war on bitcoin has started or a considerably larger player is trying to enter the market and has the reach to put up this type of smokescreen.
I don't buy the story.

20% of our GDP is remittances. Can you believe that?
How can you capitalize on a new way of transferring money?
That will be the center of our discussion.

Thanks everybody. Unfortunately, localbitcoin.com doesn't havy any offers for my city.
I'll look for one that will take a wire transfer or a moneygram.
Seems to be the only choice right now.
People should sell bitcoins in amazon or something. Mass adoption is absolutely necessary. It's ridiculous to think that Latin America can't easily get their hands on bitcoins.

Not necessarily panic sell, but the principle of buy low - sell high is at work here.
Yesterday's lightning appreciation was very good from some bitcoin holders. Feeling that the price had reached the top they unload *some* of their bitcoins and make some quick cash.
I'm hoping that Thanksgiving+Christmas will have people wanting to turn some BTC into cash to buy themselves and their family's stuff. I hope the price will drop and it may cascade from there. 
BTC investors that see it as a long term investment will on average, do better than people that see it as a an investment that pays off quickly.

"The legitimate path to the transcendental, the linking of the individual with the transcendental through psychedelics, now becomes the most important political work that can be done in the light of the rising awareness of the end of history."
