So what you are saying, is that have $20,000,000 in bitcoin and since it’s “virtual”,  non-tangible, unregulated money, you can’t really BUY anything with it. But you can go on Reddit and tell us how “rich” you are in a virtual world? Is this how Fortnite snipers become Gods to their friends, but actual Marines that legit kill people are villains? ����

Bitcoin is a scam no one really understands. You either gotta believe in the scheme or get out and watch from the sidelines.

Wang Chun? Really ... you can’t make this fake currency stuff up!

Yeah. So instead of people earning “money” the old way, a bitcoin miner needs to spend old paper “money” to purchase a machine that mines a fantastical currency via a lottery, simply hoping said machine is lucky enough to score the elusive currency, of which only a few people know where it comes from. Yeah, that’s innovation bro.

What’s that worth in US dollars? A sharp stick in the ass I believe.

Please explain the “math” behind bitcoin mining. To me, it appears to be nothing more than a lottery. No different than kids finding Pokémon Go cards in the wild.

Kinda like Marijuana legalization. Be careful what you wish for.
