Oi. You got a loicence for that bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:29:58
Maybe a clue to stop listening to people/groups that are 100% irrelevant.

If the person knows about bitcoin I think it would be a good gift idea. To someone who has no idea I think it is a not so good idea.

All I'm saying is that I think it would come off as a weird gift to someone who isn't technically able to look into bitcoin. It's not exactly a very user friendly currency yet, especially for someone that is not good around computers.

Wow, an actual good deal specific for bitcoin. Hope we see more things like this.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:18:53
Looking at different charts it is actually considered a bubble at this point. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:26:53
I'm not on either side (It's all one giant experiment). This is hilarious.
@_date: 2014-12-20 12:36:50
A definite bull run will not be confirmed until we break $460 at this point. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:14:19
I am not negative, but it is quite simple with bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency for that matter). If you see good potential in bitcoin then support it. Realize that bitcoin is very new still, and should be seen as very risky at this point.

I guess we need to make the price of 1 bit = $1 then.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:22:30
you might save a few dollars if you wait, because I think we will head down further. But it's not at a bad price right now.

I have 4 of those block erupters sitting around as well. I should do the same thing.

What? They said please...
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:31:26
Bullshit if true.

pokemon go should just say pokemon. The brand attracted that many people...not the app. The brand has been around for a long time.

I just had a similar experience buying my new monitor setup from Newegg. Although, they need some information for receiving, it still is such a smooth transaction.

Nice. Grats to the free pizzas 
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:02:02
If you thought bitcoin was going to be the one and only, you are just naive.
@_date: 2016-05-18 22:00:32
Maybe that's why they didn't initiate the sell, because it wasn't a significant amount.
