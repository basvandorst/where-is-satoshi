It's simple, for example on fiat notes Pound Sterling there is written *"Will Pay to the bearer on demand."* you could go to a bank and exchange that IOU for Gold, now you can't.
I believe that on US fiat notes they removed that guarantee all together, so fiat notes are just pieces of paper. It's just a giant ponzi scheme.

Due to it's success, they're also many other ropes in this shop, for example there is a rope named *"that was your arse*" however it is a fake or copy, and it cost $400.
Question is, which one do you buy?

The "Sheeple" require **"Shepherds"** to protect them from harm, *that's what they're led to believe*.
 
However! these alleged shepherds. are just wolves in sheep's clothing.
For example, let's read the following snippet from the OP's attached piece...


If the above author believes in the facts of the disclosed paragraph that he/she has written, wouldn't they also , know the following example,... 
1. That a Fiat Bank Note is nothing more than a 
    [Promissory Note]
    (
2. Example, an English [£10 Note]( disclose's the following
   *promise*    **"PROMISE TO PAY THE BEARER ON DEMAND THE SUM OF TEN POUNDS**  
Ten Pounds of what? *you may ask* it's not been 
backed by Gold, Silver, for decades, just a promise. Yet it's a legal instrument, and tender.
**HODL** on, didn't the author just write and post the following?... *"The very reason for the existence of legally binding documents in economic relations where transfer of ownership rights is taking place, is because arrangements based on faith or promisesis are completely useless."* 
Yes he did, and according to him, any lawful or legal "contract written or otherwise", involved in property, land, or any other tangible asset/item, that has utilised any fiat in the transfer of ownership, are null and void, this fact **"is because arrangements based on faith or promisesis are completely useless."** example, homes, cars, land, etc.... oh! dear.
PS. I never spell "promisesis" like that, promise.

I refer to the above as programming.


Yet here you're **still** giving the banks a "quick reach around and pat on the back", even though you acknowledge that you're getting shafted by the same institutions.
 &gt; so it's up to you guys, arrogant or not, to educate and convince others in a productive manner.
Oh really!
**Firstly**, I don't give financial advice, not for free anyway.
**Secondly**, I'm not aware of any contract that I should convince you or anybody else in respect of Bitcoin.
**Thirdly,** I attempted dry humor, but that flew over your head like a bubble^e^e^. Arrogant or not, I'm **not** here to educate you, convince you, coerce you, or pander to your confused fragile state of mind, in respect of Bitcoin or any other financial instrument.
**Fourthly,** Bitcoin is not a company or a get quick rich scheme, use your search bar, do your own research, and most of all be humble in your quest, you come across like a wannabe Gordon Gecko wearing braces and a belt at the same time.

It goes something like this, you code up a scam token/coin,  you then bung/give/bribe the exchange 20% of these premined coins/tokens for hosting these coins on the exchange AKA as voting. 
Once enough people have bought into the scam, you dumb the coins and disappear with profit and exchange, fools fall for it all the time. Now they call them **ICO**
be careful sheeple, they want your Bitcoin.

Wells Fargo is one of the share holders of the Federal Reserve, so they own the money that is created.
So imagine if you got fined "1 Billion Joe Public Bucks" that you could create, by writing "Joe Public Buck" on a bit of paper, you wouldn't give  a rats arse about any fine.
