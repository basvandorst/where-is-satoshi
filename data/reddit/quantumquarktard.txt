I think actually using bitcoin in the presentation would be most compelling. ie having a confederate in the audience and then at the end, scanning his phone's wallet's qr code and sending $1-$10 USD worth of BTC...

glad it took you two days to dig up something on the internet, because you obviously dont have it in you head. Whats in a name? Sure they called themselves National Socialists, but fascism was a totally new animal. Strange that there are no/few pictures with Mussolini and Lenin/Stalin, considering he was, likewise as you infer, a socialist/communist...

coinbase is awesome! I feel totally secure with them holding a couple btc for me, and look forward to cashing them out when they bubble up to 30k each by the end of the summer. Not to happy with their disinformation campaign about transactions per second/scaling and threats of a fork...

i agree with around 30k, then obviously a big drop, maybe back down 5-10k, also i would note that I have seen quote this number : P

I would never give the MTA any of my precious. Did you know that the MTA was founded in secret by Governor Nelson Rockefeller and his brother, over at Chase, David? And that they secretly pull the strings at the other major NYC public utility, Con Ed.

oh really? where did you get your history degree? (1) all of the fascists governments (German and Italian) were out of power by 1950, so characterizing them as mid-century is incorrect (2) Hitler spent most of the 1920s fighting the German Socialist Party and Mussolini was from what I remember a disillusioned anarchist  (3) and more to the point, America saw Germany's miraculous economic boom and wanted to imitate their growth. When FDR came to power, he first tried to revive the economy through cartelization, ie giving the major industrialists/companies the power to set prices, while at the same time making sure that workers had the right to collective bargaining. It was only after that didn't work, in say 1935-6, that the government hired massive amounts of people to plant trees and build infrastructure projects -- and in general those people only had their government jobs for a year or two at most (4) all you libertarians spew stuff about big government but the size of the USG drastically increased during the American civil war, not during the Great Depression/FDR era. (5) an average of 14-5 million people die of natural causes in China annually, though I will admit that the famines of 1959-60 were the results of very bad central planning (6) Comparing Mao and GWB is pure ignorance, considering that Mao led a billion people out of penury and help establish a Chinese sense of nationalship and independence....I  could go on...fascist dictatorships are the ultimate expression of oligarchy that has tricked/conned the masses through either a cult of personality or nationalist rhetoric or fear of the other into submission and subservience...bro...dont be amazed when you see the true dragon.

are SHA3 encryption schemes quantum resistant?
@_date: 2016-03-28 23:59:29
No cuz btc should just be used for buying an eighth on the darknets, maybe you want the banksters to invest? I saw a post the other day with a quote from the libor scandal dude who said he would have stashed his money in btc cuz it is untouchable... if all fiat will be worth doodoo.. why wouldnt they hold/ move in btc? Maybe u support the *other* cartel like cia?
