bitcoin is different between Github and bitcoin.org. Some official statement should be made about this. This is kind of a big deal, particularly with the theft of $31 million of Ethereum yesterday.
Comparing bitcoin-0.13.1.tar.gz from bitcoin.org and from Github:
From bitcoin.org, 5187256 bytes, 1303 files, 25496K.
From Github, 5952085 bytes, 1690 files, 24800K.
Files which are in Github tarball and not in bitcoin.org tarball (not the whole list):
Edit: Damn it! How does one quote a whole block?
