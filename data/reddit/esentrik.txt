The real story here is that those silver and gold coins were probably bought years ago for a fraction of their current value. Don't just HODL BTC. You gotta HODL precious metals too.

Crypto bag-holder confirmed!  
I guess you just don't know about the many existing methods and mechanisms out there.

Don't be a bag-holder. Buy the original. Buy the real thing. Buy gold.

As a precious metals investor, I love seeing the financial red-pilling of the masses. As is the case in this instance regarding purchasing power, so many of the arguments presented by the crypto space apply equally well to gold and silver.
@_date: 2019-06-09 20:50:17
I couldn't agree more. The issue at stake is the supply of currency and the mechanism behind it. Being digital is nearly irrelevant to the conversation. There's nothing novel about being digital.

Why would you walk around with a gold nugget? That is stupid. So many better ways to spend your gold. At least make a realistic analogy if you are being butthurt about it. Do you walk around with paper QR codes for your BTC?
@_date: 2019-06-09 19:34:24
Why is everyone pretending like fiat is not digital? I go weeks at a time without handling physical currency. I send money electronically all the time through email transfers and tapping my credit card.

Buy gold
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:47:50
Exactly. Thanks for your reasonable reply. Not sure why I got all those downvotes - especially without any replies. Crypto fanboys like to remain in their echo chambers I guess. Don't know why they would be against crypto as part of an anti-fiat, inflation hedge diversification strategy. Its not all or nothing. So much butthurt every time I post on this subreddit anything pro-gold. You can have both, you fucking dumbass fanboy hodlers.

Gold is the money of kings, silver is the money of gentlemen, barter is the money of peasants – but debt is the money of slaves.

Gold confiscation will never happen. Your other points against gold are valid, but some might think of some of them as good things - not bad. There is something satisfying and comforting about holding a real, tangible asset with 5,000+ years of history vs. a fashionable series of 0s and 1s thats dependent on infrastructure and crypto knowledge. I guess it depends what kind of apocalypse you are preparing for. There is a very good reason that central banks accumulate gold and not BTC.
Also, in 2018, crypto thefts and scams were over $1 billion and gold thefts were negligible. If a thief gets ahold of your BTC, consider it gone forever. Gold at least has the potential for recovery until its been melted down and resold.
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:11:53
The rational behind confiscation does not work today. Gold is not required to increase the money supply. The Fed has been increasing money supply without gold since 1971. That is literally why people want to hold BTC today - inflation protection! Also, private US citizens do not own enough gold to move the needle enough in a crisis.
The logistics of confiscation would also be a nightmare. Its just not practical. Wealth confiscation through inflation is a much better, covert tool and its been happening under our noses for decades already.
BTC hodlers want you to imagine a type of gold Gestapo, going door to door, asking for your gold. It will never happen.
At worst, UHNW individuals who have literally tons of gold held in custody at TBTF banks would be at risk as the banks collude with the gov't to ward of collapse and bankruptcy. They might wake up to find their accumulated physical assets have been exchanged against their will for fiat currency at a government-approved exchange rate. Those individuals would be best to store their gold outside the banking system.

I know I've already won the argument when you completely avoid addressing my points because you have no rebuttal, and then reference another subreddit which is the type of insult you would expect from a teenager. Why should I address you points when you won't address mine, save a few straw man arguments?
You did not address the fact that gold confiscation was a tool to combat deflation. The great depression was deflation. Deflation is not the risk today. Inflation is the risk today. The Fed does not need gold to issue new currency. That was the whole point of not being on the gold standard anymore. Address this point from my previous post or stop replying to me because you are at your wits end.
They went off the gold standard in 1971 - not 1933. This was known as the Nixon shock. Clearly you do not know what you are talking about, especially if you are saying the reasons do not matter.
I should not have even written this post, as you are clearly too obtuse when it comes to the nuances of history and monetary policy.
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:56:35
Why don't central banks buy cryptos then? Are you smarter than them?

You are not a smart man haha  
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:53:51
I don't know. Just don't underestimate the NSA or CIA. Or they will simply make it illegal to hold and spend, which would crush the price, its adoption and its utility.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:43:40
You think you will be allowed to keep BTC but not gold? haha
At least gold is in my possession and its outside the banking system. Think of it as cold storage crypto, except you don't lose everything in a fire or flood.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:42:43
That could be said about literally any asset.

I knew you would not address the inflation/deflation part, despite me calling it out multiple times. Definitely at your wits end.

I agree and I hope this holds true.
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:09:28
Exactly. During an inflationary event, its good to hold gold. See, you didnt even realize you agreed with me haha

I would love to see some figures on amount of gold stolen each year vs. the number of crypto thefts and scams each year.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:37:04
1. OP did not mention a "crisis" being a part of his rationale.
2. Gold confiscation would not happen today because its simply not worth the effort. A very, very tiny fraction of society's wealth is held in precious metals today. This is also why you can make a good bullish case for gold. A more likely scenario in a crisis is a bank bail-in with deposits being confiscated.
3. Gold confiscation would be a legal and logistical nightmare today. Much more than in 1933. They also would need to know who owns gold to go knock on their door. This would only effect very high net-worth people.
4. Anything electronic is much easier to regulate or shut down by the government. I can see crypos being made illegal before they would bother with gold.
@_date: 2019-01-16 03:08:36
Time will tell, but for now its totally unproven and should be considered nothing more than speculation. Putting more than 15% of your net worth into it is terribly irresponsible. I could sleep soundly knowing all my money is in gold or even dollars or euros. I could not say the same about crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:42:03
Of course I have. I am extremely familiar with it. It would not work today and it is totally unnecessary on top of that.
The dollar was backed by gold, so they HAD to confiscate gold in order to create new dollars and generate some inflation. Today, the Fed can create dollars with a key stroke. They don't need my gold to do it. 1933 was a deflationary depression. The risk today is inflation, not deflation. You are terribly confused and misguided, like a lot of crypto enthusiasts with no deep understanding of sound money and monetary policy.
Also, if you are citing 6102, then you must also believe that they will confiscate your cryptos so your point is garbage.
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:23:11
Gold has been THE ultimate currency for like 5,000 years. You think its rein is over now because of cryptos?
So if you were a central banker, you would put national security at risk by dumping the nation's wealth into something unproven, new, volatile, and that is not accepted by other sovereign nations, instead something like gold which has outlasted ALL other currencies and civilizations?
This is why you are not a central banker. You do not understand risk.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:38:25
I only have a little exposure to cryptos, but I have been a goldbug for a while and am happy that cryptos are getting people to take the financial red pill.
@_date: 2019-01-14 19:44:19
Physical gold in your  possession has no counterparty risk.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:46:55
You think the gov't would confiscate gold but not cryptos? Are you imagining and giant federal gestapo going door to door and demanding I hand over any gold I have? How do they know I have gold anyways? Would it not be easier to just flip a switch at the NSA and kill or take over BTC?
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:39:49
If shit goes down to the point that people are raiding and pillaging, I don't think the electrical grid or internet would be available. What good is BTC during the zombie apocalypse? No self-respecting prepper is going to trade his limited food and ammo for BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:39:12
1. Gold confiscation is a tool during a deflationary crisis as it causes inflation. You are terribly confused. A currency failure is inflationary as it becomes worthless. See Zimbabwe or Wiemar Germany for examples.
2. Governments intervene in the gold market yes. That is an entirely different scale and mechanism compared to boots-on-the-ground, door to door confiscation from private citizens.
3. Very few gun owners volunteer their guns. People will not just hand over gold.
4. If you believe your own logic in  then the govt would make you hand over your BTC, right?  
Gold confiscation is totally unnecessary. If the Fed wants to create more money out of thin air to combat a deflationary depression, they can do so. They do not need gold to do it as was the case in the 1933 when the dollar was backed by gold. The Fed conjures trillions out of thin air every year without taking away citizens gold.
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:16:04
I disagree with his comments on gold. Gold mining is increasingly hard just like mining bit coin. Both approach an asymptote. Its taken all of human history to mine all the gold, and bit coin will take a matter of decades.
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:26:41
If that is your rationale, then you should be buying gold like the much more well-informed central banks of the world.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:04:01
This is why I started buying gold and silver after the housing crash, and why I lately I buy some BTC too.
