I hope so. 
Btw we have almost found the main sponsor. 
On the italian community i was explaining that at this point ( in order to gain trust for me and for the staff) we could create a society wallet, publish it on the official website, and create 4 levels of sponsorship: gold, star, silver, bronze.
Depending on the donations achieved there will be a different treatment  ( obv decided before starting donations). The remaining (achieved - required) will be either returned back or spent in flyers and material to be distributed during the matches. Besides i was thinking of a little lottery at each game. One between the public will be extracted and can win a variable sum (10/20/30€) in BTC. This should bring both curiosity and public. 
Let me know what you think

Yep, but i didn't use to frequent this site and i can link the part where they suggested me to ask here. 
this is the link original, there's also my proposal for the release of btcs. 
This is the link of the team.. 
obv you don't have to trust me... but you can deposit donations to an address chosen by you and release btc only after you'll get enough evidence these money will go to the team (society wallet). I'll post photos of the team keeping in hands the QR code of the society wallet and an interview video with the coach. All this BEFORE btcs are actually released to the team obv. Let me know

Thank you for asking... i actually didn't think about that because i didn't want to scam from the beginning:)
Anyway, would be the community interested in this project?

No problem:) Yes, we prolly have found it, although the only signature on contract is missing... on monday i have to meet the society and we'll elaborate some packages for sponsorship and we'll see if the community is still interested.. lottery was a bad idea, i've tought about it later
