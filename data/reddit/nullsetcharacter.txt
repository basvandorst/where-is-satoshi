It's because of the near unlimited support at $110. These are all buy orders from MtGox themselves. They will buy an unlimited number of coins at that price since they can just transfer them to bitstamp and make easy money from arbitrage.

Bitcoins use SHA256 keys. Although it isn't possible to break them now, I assure you in the future there will be far far better cryptographic algorithms and SHA256 will be easy to break at that point due to an exponential increase in computing power.

Most people here are speculating idiots so of course the price matters to them. If they were actually using it for what it was meant to be used, rather than HODLing, then we wouldn't have this problem.

He's right. The thing all currencies have in common is that they are all backed by something that is actually valuable in some way. For USD, that backing is the US government. For the Euro it's the ECB, for gold (actual commodity money) it is the physical metal. Bitcoin is backed by a bunch of numbers and its price is entirely set by speculatory behavior.

And for the record, everyone knew long ago that Karpeles was full of shit when he said the coins were stolen.

I don't think you understand what an economy is. It isn't about the market value of a trading implement. It's about how much goods and services can be produced and exchanged amongst people. If bitcoins are being hoarded and not spent, they're not contributing to the economy because they're not facilitating service and good transfers.

It doesn't matter how you as an individual are using it since to claim it as a currency requires making determinations about how it is being used by the collective economy.

@_date: 2014-03-27 20:52:24
Money isn't a delusion, it's an agreement. Real money, that is. Not fake internet money like WoW gold and bitcoins. 
We've all collectively agreed that bitcoin isn't a legitimate currency. For evidence of this, see the recent IRS ruling stating definitively that it is merely a commodity traded on online exchanges. It doesn't really matter what you think about how money works because you don't get to decide these things.

1. Funds can be frozen or confiscated by a 51% attack, which is entirely in the realm of possibility. There are [a few mining pools]( that control most of the hashing power.
2. Not true that there are no restrictions to paying whomever you want since there are places where [it is illegal to use bitcoin]( So the restriction is that if you are breaking your local laws against bitcoin you can end up in jail, which is a pretty big restriction in my eyes.
3. I have never once paid any fees whatsoever to transfer money to people, to pay bills, or get money from ATMs. It really isn't that hard if you choose a bank that doesn't dick over its customers. There's plenty of them out there.

This community (including all bitcoin users on earth) is irrelevant since it is made up of a small contingent of faux libertarians that want nothing more than to commit tax evasion.
As far as the definition thing, not sure how it is on your canadian bucks but in the United States the US dollar is the only legal tender. Actually just pull out one of your dollar bills, it should state something like that on the bill itself. You cannot satisfy tax debts with anything but stamps (which were purchased with US dollars anyway) and US dollars. It is by lawful decree that the only thing that can satisfy a tax debt is the currency of the state that owns that debt, which is really the only thing that makes the currency legitimate in the first place.

Why would you rejoice? This is just deluding yourself into thinking you've made a good choice when actually you've made a bad choice. I have a portfolio of actual investments and it's not ever a happy time when they decrease in value. You can convince yourself that it's great since you can buy more for less, but the truth is that you want to buy investments that continue increasing in value since that's what they're supposed to do. Buying an investment that has chronic lapses of intense value loss isn't an ideal investment since that isn't how good investments are supposed to behave.


Again, delusional thinking. The bulk of your "investment" is losing value, that's the reality. You can soften the blow and make it feel better by averaging in, but the truth is that you've made a bad choice if this is how your "investment" behaves.


You only say that because you need other idiot speculators to prop up your position.

This is what doomed bitcoin from the beginning. On a fundamental level you can't get it through people's heads that it is to be used for transacting only; never should anyone thing of a "currency" as an investment. If you do this, you're doing things incredibly wrong.

Faith is not what holds up legitimate asset classes. Dollar is not backed by faith, it is backed by an incredibly powerful government and it's underlying economy, as well as the fact that taxes have to be paid in that currency to prevent losing ones freedoms. Equity is backed by the underlying business that is capable of producing predictable revenue flows by producing goods and services. Debt instruments like bonds are backed by the creditworthiness of the borrower, etc. I don't think you really know what you're talking about when you say every asset is based on faith. No. A true asset has value that is demonstrable.

Chargebacks don't need to exist in bitcoin, but third party payment processors that use bitcoin can certainly implement it themselves. They're the ones taking on the risk, and should be compensated accordingly, for providing a service that allows chargebacks to their customers. There are no chargebacks with cash, and similarly there should be no chargebacks with bitcoin. However, just how someone can pay with a credit card in US dollars, there should be similar services that let you pay with a credit card denominated in bitcoin where the credit card company provides the consumer protection of chargebacks where the company itself shoulders the risk.

Are you advocating the murder (or threat of murder) of Mark Karpeles? Because how else are you going to self regulate and FORCE him to return the coin? You can't. Someone has to compel him to return the money by threat of imprisonment or death, and that's going to either be vigilantes or the government. I'd rather have the government do it.

It's only valuable to professional speculators (and in this I include institutional speculators as well like banks). Spreads don't really matter to people who are using it for its actual purpose.
Think about it. For the entire time that I own the asset, I don't give a fuck about market liquidity. I only care about this if I want to do massive amounts of trades up and down to capture price fluctuations.
So for regular people who aren't trying to get rich quick, I would disagree with you that it is adding any value whatsoever.

@_date: 2014-03-14 20:48:15
Exactly. The technology is valuable as a means for reassigning the owner of a unit of currency. However, bitcoin itself is utter garbage because it isn't backed by anything and there is no way to apply monetary policy to it. There will be a better crypto. It just won't be bitcoin winning in the end.

Actually, I do have a say, as does everyone else. Stop being a pretentious prick that thinks no one is entitled to an opinion.

Real businesses will always convert it to real currencies like euro, dollars, and yen, because those actually stable and can be used to directly satisfy expenses paid to suppliers and for paying labor. This isn't going to change.

Bitcoin is not and has never been anonymous. Not sure who gave you the idea it was.

Negative amounts of money. Not sure how much though. But you'd have to be paying me actual money (like euros, dollars, yen) to accept bitcoins before i'd say they were under valued.

No one will ever take bitcoin seriously either.

Well since the bitcoin core developers are the central authority of bitcoin itself, I suppose we would be petitioning them to make that the official symbol of the currency.

I'm sorry but I don't think anyone is taking issue with the fact that SR was an online drug marketplace. The only reason people are defending DPR is because he had his marketplace use bitcoin instead of some other form of payment. There isn't a rational explanation why so many here would defend his (alleged) actions to conspire to commit murders against people who threatened his livelihood. I can guarantee if he was running a regular run of the mill drug operation and THEN people found out he was hiring hit men, they wouldn't defend him. They would say he's a monster and needs to be locked up, that we cannot have an online marketplace that has blood on its hands. But because bitcoin is involved, all of a sudden the retards come out of the woodwork defending them because they *have to* to save face for the whole bitcoin community and "movement" going on here.

he can descend down the blockchain and follow the coins from their creation.
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:42:35
Look at this: if bitcoin ever actually became mainstream, it's adoption curve would become hyperbolic until it saturates the entire market, at which point it would become merely exponential (scaling with population/economic growth). This means that the blockchain will grow similarly, and how are we going to deal with this problem realistically? Everyone using the bitcoin network has to download the entire blockchain to understand who owns what, and the data overhead to do this is going to become unreasonable. Why aren't more people talking about this inevitable problem with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:42:42
This is a good article but this is anything that doesn't promote the fact that we are on the rocketship heading to the moon and that bitcoin is the final solution and the true master race of currencies is going to get buried to oblivion. Critically thought out articles need not apply.

Ok. I read it again. The third paragraph still doesn't address lost coins removed from the money supply because they end up sent to nonexistent or forgotten addresses.

This is what's ruining bitcoin. Speculators. You should only be buying the currency to transact with and nothing more.

This is the question he's really asking, and your answer seems to be geared at something completely different (subdivision of currency units)

No. You don't have a choice.


I don't agree, and most of us don't agree with your radical way of thinking either.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:51:03


The fallacy you subscribe to is that choices are only made by individuals. We as a society have decided it to be this way, which is what makes it moral for taxes to be paid vs the immorality of an individual taking from another individual.


Not true. Throughout history most of the population were not slave owners. It has never been the majority (as a fraction of total world population) opinion that slavery is a good thing. A minority of the population that benefitted from slavery did however think it was a good idea.


The videos are pretty dumb and reinforce what we already know, which is that your idea of living in a taxless society is quite looney.

Just because negative news is being posted about bitcoin doesn't make it some big conspiracy to debase bitcoin. Why can't you deal with the reality that both positive and negative things are happening to your beloved currency. Or are you that much of a fanboy that you dismiss all negative news as being haters that want to manipulate the price of bitcoin?

Comparing paying taxes to robbery is incredibly hyperbolic. The reason is this: when you get robbed, you lose property/possessions and receive nothing in return. When you pay taxes, you get a lot in return. Taxes pay for the infrastructure of our society: education, law enforcement, roads, military defense, scientific/health research, etc.


Answer: no. But you don't have a choice in the matter. You have to pay your taxes because all of us (as a society) collectively decided that this is the best arrangement for all of us. If you don't like this then work to change it.

That's death from resistance, not death from failing to pay. Not paying in and of itself doesn't result in death, but it will result in being caged. And in that case, you should be caged. Paying taxes is a civic duty. If you don't like how the tax structure is then work to change it.

This isn't a surprise, nor is it shocking, nor is it unusual. 2% inflation is a modest goal and if you can do some simple math you see that it results in a reduction of purchasing power of approx 33%:
1/(1.02^20) ~= 0.67
This is what the Fed is SUPPOSED to be doing, and its not a bad monetary policy at all. You're not supposed to be hoarding cash all the time, that isn't good for the economy. Cash is for transacting. If you have a ton of money you should be putting it to good use investing it in something that will produce an actual return.
