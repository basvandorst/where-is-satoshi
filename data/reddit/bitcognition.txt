The Lamassu Bitcoin ATM says that it does not require a permit or license to operate. I'm just unsure if this is the one I should buy and what to expect when using it in the US.

Great to see states taking a more lenient stance regarding bitcoin regulations. Hopefully most of the others states will understand that it is an innovation and invention that simply will not go away and that the best way to handle it is by understanding it first. It seems as if too many regulators go on trying to make rules without fully comprehending the technology's potential. It can literally bring banking to about one billion people who already have access to the internet but are unable to have access to traditional banking. There will be a growth of communities where an internet connection exists just as rivers and streams do.

If you are willing to meet me in donations then I can get this going much sooner rather than later.

My intention is to have them consider accepting it, but I do see how they will coexist.

I am actually very knowledgable of Bitcoins and their merchants. Private message me and I can help you in anyway possible. I am also available to meet up as I live in Rockland County outside of New York City

Charlotte, North Carolina-based PassportParking announced on Tuesday a solution that will allow drivers to pay for parking using bitcoin through the company’s Mobile Pay service at supported meters and surface lots.
The company, which provides parking facility operators solutions in the way of cloud-based software.
“We currently have coverage in over 35 states with facilities across 75 clients which include municipalities, universities and private operators,” a company spokesperson told newsBTC.
“Bitcoin is superior for online payments and today many traditional brick and mortar payments are moving online – you pay for your taxi using Square and for your parking using PassportParking,” Michael Gronager, COO of Payward (the company behind exchange Kraken) said. “We have always used coins for parking so using bitcoins is the natural successor.”
The company has teamed up with BitPay in order to process the transactions.
The service will launch in North Carolina starting with parking facilities operator Park Charlotte, who run a number of lots in the Charlotte area.
“This great technology is what we’ve come to expect from Passport,” said Ross Brewer, who heads Park Charlotte. “By allowing us to accept payment directly from our customer, without the need for a middleman, is a win-win situation for us and our customers.”
The announcement comes as the first of its kind in the parking industry. Will the competitors catch on and follow suit?

Good publicity this week if you ask me. Enough Mt. Gox news.
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:09:39
This makes a very good argument concerning why Mt Gox will fail. In my opinion, it has caused a lot of trouble in addition to blaming the bitcoin protocol and hence mainstream adoption.  Without outside money to help bail it out then I hope people will be more wise with their money and leave the exchange.

I'm really looking to raise awareness so I started a site where once I get some donations then I will contact the local news station to see if they're willing to do a segment.

A majority of the current world's wealth is owned by less than 100 people who have received ill-gotten gains. Currently, there are thousands of people who own bitcoin and it is with the distribution of new wealth that people will be able to shift the power of wealth.  The current wealthy WOULD HAVE HAD to already purchased a lot of the bitcoins.  This is at least a chance to change the current economic standing. You can be pessimistic and simply watch others gain benefits. I hope that you don't beat yourself up too much.

Does anyone else notice that every post automatically has 1 downvote? Whoever it is that is trolling should understand that their downfall is inevitable. You can try and silence us and harm us but I know that you will NEVER be able to ignore us.

Are you really arguing IN FAVOR of Mt. Gox not addressing their customers about what was happening?
They found it much more appropriate to shut down without any notice and cease all trading. This is clearly a bad business and deserves  to fall so that bitcoins can rise.

One Stat to Destroy Your Faith in Humanity: The World’s 85 Richest People Own as Much as the 3.5 Billion Poorest
When value shifts from the dollar to bitcoin then there will be people who believed in a currency and its potential who will have most of the wealth rather than the corrupt who have it now. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:11:42
Very well done. I will be posting this video as the introductory video on a playlist that I have on my site which helps to get people to adopt bitcoin. This was much needed. Thank you for your hard work. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:45:04
This is exactly how a Bitcoin article should be written. First showing how bitcoins are being deliberately put in a bad light and pointing out the double standard. When cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, succeeds then we'll be in a world where the richest individuals in the world are techies that believed in a revolutionary technology as opposed to the collection of scum that own a majority of the wealth now. We have a chance to shift power back to people since governments will have to depend on its citizens to fund its wars instead of easily printing millions of bills in a warehouse. 
Take a stand for something that matters and be aware of the corruption around you. We can make a change.

The BTC Center in NYC is a great idea since it educates investors that come in everyday to go through a 4 hour crash course on the workings of the Bitcoin protocol. They also host gathers similar to Satoshi Squares. I plan to visit very soon as I live in the area.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:54:47
I see what you're saying.
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:00:59
The government for whatever reason issued that each of the 50 states individually create regulatory measures. Probably one of the reasons that Canada or Australia is excelling in adoption of bitcoins since they generally have accepted the currency without trying to create incredibly restrictive laws. Imagine if the internet was only about 5 years old and countries tried to hinder its innovation. The internet would not have been able to grow at the pace that it has which is very important for everyone to consider. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:39:03
Would it be better for me to post myself on LocalBitcoins? I want to just raise adoption and make the community aware in my area.

I just found one called an OpenBitcoinATM for about $500.
Does anyone know if this would be a wise purchase?

How much would you be willing to invest?
I have as much as $6000 to spend.

ALL REPUTABLE Bitcoin resources should make the same move. Tainting the public's view and adoption by making false claims about how EVERY exchange has the same flaws and that the Bitcoin protocol is to blame. Shame on you.

I don't think he understands the potential value of bitcoins as of right now. I live in NY where I am part of a community service group that distributes food and clothing to the homeless that I'm trying to get to accept bitcoins for them to purchase any goods with. It seems as if he sees it as just a way to anonymously send value. 
Maybe I can ask him "will you go on a community service run with me so I can show you what bitcoins are able to do in the 'real-world'?"
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:23:30
My site shows you how to setup an account and basically it allows you to set how many bitcoins you want to always have a balancd of if you don't want to convert immediately.

Good to see that there is a new directory added that allows people to circulate into the bitcoin economy. Very good idea. CoinMap.org is also a good source for any interested readers. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:14:45
I believe that people should understand that bitcoins and applying the protocol as currency is ONLY one way of how it can be used. When more applications become put to use then we'll see more people less timid to say they have the "to the moon" mentality.

It's meant to be followed on Instagram as a means of being able to read quick updates regarding bitcoin. 
Any suggestions on anything I should do?

Stop linking without posting the article if it seems like complete ignorant reporting because they still get ad revenue which is what they care about. Not about reporting complete facts. 
Here's the article:
Last week, Bitcoin’s value tumbled 9% in one day on news that China’s central bank had ordered banks and payment companies to close trading accounts belonging to more than 10 exchanges. Since then, Bitcoin has crashed by nearly another 10%, now hovering around $480. It’s a steep decline from the feverish highs above $1,100 last November.
Ominously, general interest in Bitcoin is declining sharply, regardless of the recent turbulence. Google Trends shows that even though you would expect the break below the $500 level to generate a lot of curiosity, the search volume for “Bitcoin” is actually far below where it was in late February, when the pseudo-currency dropped below $600.
The drama swirling around Bitcoin is not dissipating at all. Recent items on Chinese central bank moves and the sudden discovery of hundreds of thousands of vanished Bitcoins are just as compelling as the news flow was a few months ago. But people have started losing interest. Search volume peaked last November as Bitcoin price topped $1,100, then had a smaller peak in late February as the price tumbled below $600.
But the latest Bitcoin crash is no longer piquing the interest of the general public at all.
Outside of Iceland, that is — the volcanic island remains the top country in the world when it comes to Bitcoin search volume relative to population size. That is because in the lava plains of Reykjanesbaer, Bitcoin-mining is a real industry thanks to cold air and geothermal energy.
Iceland was one of the biggest victims of the global financial crisis of 2008. Hopefully the nascent Bitcoin industry will fare better than Kaupthing did.

I'm looking to convince as many neighboring businesses to accept BTC so I've been developing a site to help them understand it. This is ONE of the videos I want to present them with. I'm a biology pre-med student that had money invested in the currency which just absolutely fascinates me. I'm involved in community service groups such as Habitat for Humanity and Rotoract International. I feel like the people who believe in Bitcoin have similar values where they are tired of people in power being corrupt and too powerful to have any meaningful consequences for their actions. I know that it will grow and the power of money will actually get into the hands of those who righteously attained it.

What possessed you to do this?
Their incompetence was known and you still wanted to gamble a few thousand dollars. I'm sorry, but you deserved to lose that money. You KNEW about the problems at Gox and still wanted to gamble for some cheap coins.

I'm working to help people learn to adopt bitcoin better by showing them how it works so they can see its potential. 
I want to make this site a resource for people to use when it is actually setup because I've made it so posts can appear on both Twitter and Facebook.
