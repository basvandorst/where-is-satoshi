The Winklevoss brothers will continue to be on the cutting edge of innovation doing fascinating things for the rest of their lives, and they've got a long life to go.

Zealot:  a person who is fanatical and uncompromising in pursuit of their religious, political, or other ideals
Should a person who eather believes in government or does not not be one of these things?
If you believe the government is not a just institution why would you be okay with sitting back and relaxing while people run roughshod over the free exchange of human beings?
If you believe government is justified and makes the world better why wouldn't you stand for it defiantly while people try to undermine it?
I have my own opinion here but you should notice that your opinion is one that is committed to one of those sides of zealotry. You're not separate from the thing you are arguing against.

Putting people in unsafe conditions that are know to be unsafe is unethical. The parties responsible for the series of decisions that led to this disaster should be individually identified and be held socially and financially responsible for arbitrating resolution with the survivors.

Thats just one sad aspect of it. What worries me is the unspoken and unimaginable volumes of trust degredation in society at large. People who work hard get less and less for more and more work.

The flaw in your argument is a practical one, no government is able to protect the rights of the individual. Including what was once a very small government the USA.

I"m not convinced that the government had a right to levy debts against people without their expressed individual consent.

If you're in bitcoin you know what is going on with your money. If your in fiat you have no idea, and that's part of what's wrong here. The other part is that this individual had nothing to do with Greek law and policy. There are two classes, yes even in a democracy, the ruling class and the working class. The ruling class has effectively broken this man and everyone here knows it. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:05:27

"the greeks".... I think you mean to say the ruling class has fucked the working class.
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:26:14
Wrong, it's everyone that fucked him. 
He likely had absolutely nothing to do with the bailouts or the original loans taken out by his government. And the institutions who knew his government couldn't/wouldn't pay back their money should not have loaned it out in the first place. The people around him convincing him he was safe from harms way are equally to blame. 
A whole world based on the ethics of snatching and grabbing as much as you can has broken this and many other people.

Hey bro, yeah if you could just cry somewhere else? Thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:34:56
Well it seems to me to be this discussion exactly. 
If you take out a personal loan for more than you can afford and you default that's between you and your lender. If your government does it on your behalf, not only can you (individually) say, "no I don't need the money now" but you also can't say, "I'm uncomfortable with what you're spending this money on." nor could you say, "I know I will be in my 60's and unable to afford the bill, please don't!" nor, "I think I'll pass, I'm simply not personally wealthy enough to cover that much;"  nor "I have to retire some day and I've worked too hard to die starving."
This is a *major* problem with the structure of governments overall that needs to find an end. A government has no business bonding it's people ever. For one thing, it is totally unjust for one group of voters to bond their children to their debts! It's like when your parents take credit out on you, it's simply disgusting and wrong. Doesn't matter what political party is doing it, it's just morally wrong. These issues are at the heart of the Greek crisis. 
TLDR: The only way a government buys what it can't afford is without the expressed permission of individuals.

Law has a basis in morals.... Like those laws about speeding and the ones about not doing drugs, and the ones about separate but equal, and the laws that say a corporation is a person and the actions of the individuals in that corporation should be insulated from the law and the laws that dictate you pay to murder foreigners or you can be arrested an the laws that used to say people can be slaves or the laws that say if you don't build your house in a certain way we can tear it down or the laws that say we can rob you any time we want if we decide it's in the publics interest or the laws that say its ok to torture certain kinds of people.... 
Laws have no basis in morality my friend, they have a basis in what's popular. Law is about what is legal and illegal and nothing else. I know this might be a new way to look at this for you so the comment might be shocking but seriously spend some time thinking about this. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 01:00:16

@_date: 2013-06-07 14:29:49
You say when they are elected it is likely, but I don't see that as true. I see that when they are elected the law comes to fit what is socially acceptable and not what is just and unjust. For instance drunkface mc Shithead is unjustly acting but the socially acceptable consequences remove that person from their families and ruins their lives if they are caught drinking and driving, while that response is popular it is not likely what is just. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:49:42
