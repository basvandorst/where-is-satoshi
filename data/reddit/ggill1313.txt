You're lamenting the fact that you have to pay interest? And you're equating this to being an employee of the bank?
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:21:07
Your whole post follows the following logic train:
* Didn't know/care how about how money worked. Wasn't bothered by it. What you did know made sense to you.
* Became interested in the inner workings.
* Ostensibly, financial system favors the wealthy. Apparently is a web of lies and misinformation. (Still haven't discussed why).
* Enter credit scores. You begin to describe how credit scores work and what they're for. Credit scores are so people know that if they give you money, you'll pay them back. In exchange for them giving you money, they want a certain percentage back per pay period. 
So let me ask you; do you think this is wrong? Do you think a credit score, used to determine reliability, is wrong? Do you think it's wrong that someone would want to get a certain percentage back for lending you money? You seem to take a negative tone toward it:


You're demonizing a service. Nobody *owes* you the right to their money. Of course someone wants to make money off of lending it to you. Of course this generates profit for the banking institution.
* Then you proceed to demonize the idea that once you've proved you are credit worthy, the bank will allow you to borrow more (which is again, a privilege) at a *lower interest rate*. And now for the most confusing part:


What else is this if not complaining that houses are expensive and that if you want to own one, you have to pay for it, and to pay for one, most people need a loan? And then you complain that somebody expects to charge you interest for the privilege of using their money? And you call that being an employee in some pejorative tone? And what do you mean for no other benefit that to own a home? Do you not think most people agree this is an appropriate trade? Do you think most people would prefer to be nomadic travelers? This whole paragraph is nothing but whining about that fact that homes cost a lot of money and that in order to afford one, you need a loan on which interest is paid. What would you prefer, homes just become cheaper? People stop charging interest for loans?


My father owns a business and has an exemplary credit score with a credit line in the hundreds of thousands. He pays all bills on time. Being a good steward of credit doesn't, as you claim, harm your score.


Did I cover your points adequately?

Quite the opposite. I thought you were touting Bcash as a segue to financial independence for some, which is laughable at best. I'm actually skeptical of BTC and its competitors. I think some people will get rich off of it, but I am suspect of whether it will be used as legitimate currency in our lifetime.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:33:07
How does Bcash = financial independence for the people?

You’re qualifying all of the reasons, the worst case scenarios, when buying a new car isn’t a good idea. 
*O b v i o u s l y* if you don’t maintain your vehicle it won’t maintain its value. Really reaching the bottom of the argument barrel with that one.
Furthermore, there are many special version, limited production, collectible super cars and luxury vehicles that aren’t vintage that will if not appreciate, maintain value. 
And you’re really showing that you don’t know what you’re talking about if you’re suggesting the Model 3 is one of the exceptions for a vehicle that will appreciate. I’m not talking about flipping for short term profit. Hell, even those are being sold at losses and you can pick up a secondhand one all day long and save a few grand.
The current Ford GT, the LaFerrari, the Centenario, the 675LT, etc., are all cars that I have the patience to type out on mobile.
And your last paragraph... in your own words, “No.”
You can absolutely be buying little more than a chassis. In fact, some people will pay for just VIN numbers. But that doesn’t mean you’ll be flipping to make a profit. Often the money that goes into restoring these cars is an act of passion, not an investment. 
And to the point about flipping cars where the damage is surface level... what? Why don’t you look into the McLaren F1, and how it’s actually appreciated after being totaled several times. 
Dude, go read a book or an Internet article or something. I feel like you’re talking out of your back end. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:53:25
I won’t buy a new economy vehicle, and I likely won’t ever have the money to buy a new luxury vehicle that could feasibly be an appreciating asset. But just because they’re out of my realm doesn’t mean they don’t exist. All the classics to be have not already been made. It’s just about predicting them.
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:15:31
You know little of cars if you think buying a Lamborghini or similar supercar is always a depreciating asset. Hell, you could turn a profit on a LaFerrari if you wanted to. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:02:02
That’s what happens when you interrupt the Tesla circlejerk. EV stuff is cool but it has its limits and pitfalls just like combustion does.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:14:06
That's a false dichotomy but ok there sport.
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:15:26
What would *I* do? First I would wonder why a police officer cares about BTC. Then I’d ask him why and that if I could talk to his superiors.
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:48:24
You guys all repeat the same circlejerk of anarchist apologetics and they're all just as silly as the last time I heard them.
There are costs associated with living. In the fantastical version of reality under its superior system you've obviously devised, there may not be, but society is so integrally connected that we must all bear the burden of its production, and we bear it as cost for existing within it. Submit to me an alternative and I will show you explicitly how your made up land has what effectively amounts to taxes. It's the cost society beyond subsistence.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:02:07
Seriously, if you need a PSA for something like this, then you have greater things to worry about.
@_date: 2019-04-19 14:56:50
No, you're freeloading. While everyone else is paying for the infrastructure, you aren't. That's not voting with your wallet. That's *stealing*. 
You're delusional.
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:30:21
Is that not a tax? You can call it something different, but it's literally a tax.
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:19:16
Then for what? Some secret purpose? Because your fingers needed a little extra workout? Boredom, maybe?  
You anarchists are hilarious. Call anyone who disagrees with you and questions your ideology a troll. Must be tough, on that side of the fence.
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:48:40
Convenient ;) Never putting your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:43:36
This sub is hilarious. I wish it would get back to its roots, not some quasi-anarchist platform for edgy teenagers to complain about the horror it is to live in a taxed society. Go on, git. Go live in the woods somewhere and don't use our roads to get there.
@_date: 2019-04-19 13:44:11
Then go live somewhere else? Pay for your own military, build your own roads, clean your own water, build up your own cities. Go live in the woods and trade the berries you pick and the hats you make out of twigs for Internet access, or BTC, so you can evade the evil grips of... *taxes. \*GASP\**
This sub is so cringy sometimes.
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:42:29
I'm surely not butthurt. I think you're being silly in your conclusion that taxes are theft and that you resorted to what is effectively a dick waving contest to somehow qualify your position a la "In fact I would bet you a hundred Satoshi I paid more in taxes than you."
If money is so meaningless, then it's curious that you attempt to use the amount you paid as clout.
@_date: 2019-04-19 14:25:11
You're being insufferable. Working in contracting, even in the public sector, I'm well aware of how frivolous the government can be. But it's currently the system we have and one that's ostensibly ever improving. 
Again, if you're so committed to your ideology, put your money where your mouth is and stop utilizing the services afforded by taxes.
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:34:53
Then what was the purpose of bringing it up?  
You already know you've messed your argument up. But keep trying to dig out.
If it's meaningless, then you bringing it up has as much to do with my understanding of taxes as how many flowers I smelled while sitting in the back of a taxi.
Better dump that purse of yours into a better education, because these meaningless upvotes on a forum dedicated to decentralized currency seem to indicate they agree more with me than you. And I know that bothers you.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:20:53
Oh thank you for defining anarchy for me. I had no idea. /s
I believe this entire time I've used anarchy in its true meaning, never implying development into chaos. Unless you just took it upon yourself to assume my ignorance.
Again, you can speak in abstracts about your fantastical society, but once more I'm asking you to define its method of function, because until then, you're arguing in advocation for a land you've left conveniently undefined.  Explain to me public infrastructure, if it exists, how it's funded, and who can use it under your system. If you respond back with the ever common "individual interest" or "business with financial interest," I will laugh all the way into next Friday. Because it so hilariously takes taxes and redefines them into another system, only the premium is payed differently. And don't even bother with the woefully comical idea of social interest public funds initiatives. Because then I will be certain you're actually 16 and started reading about anarchy yesterday on one of the off-topic threads within a stoner's forum.
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:40:05
Pics or it didn't happen.
@_date: 2019-04-19 14:31:25
Not ignorant to the fact, just aware that living within society costs money, and people will not offer up their money out of altruism on a scale to afford the physical and social infrastructure we enjoy today. There are obviously imperfections to this system, but the idea that it's theft is an echo of angsty anarchism that people love to shout while maintaining their cushy lives from the benefit of said taxes. 
Until you follow up on your espoused beliefs with action, I'm going to take all of this pontification as nothing but mis-guided piety.
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:29:07
You paid $17k last year in taxes? Good on you.
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:44:10
No it's not optional, you're still going to pay for it due to the increased economic burden from "non-drivers" causing the cost of the tolls to increase, which will certainly impact the cost of logistics for the goods and services you will undoubtedly pay for. You're still going to pay for the roads, but through the higher costs of tolls due to people that would elect not use roads. 
But to that end, how do you commute anywhere? Are you always walking? What about the public infrastructure you use to get to and fro? You just get to use the sidewalks for free?
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:40:42
Exactly. Bitcoin is not a viable currency at current simply because it doesn’t check any boxes that would appeal to the layman. Hell, even people who aren’t layman hardly use BTC as currency and more as a store of value that, hopefully, continues to appreciate.
@_date: 2019-02-23 14:31:02
All of the comments in this thread just go to show all of the reasons why BTC is going to have such a difficult time finding adoption amongst layfolk. Can you make a hardware wallet the size of a credit card? Or am I going to have to carry this thin around in complement?
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:12:01
The premise of the article is that people who profited off of BTC aren't paying taxes on the gains. Correct me if I'm wrong, but your prior comment:


seems to try and explain why people haven't been paying on their profits (less than 100 out of 250,000 reporting holdings). If not, then I suppose I'm missing the intent of your comment. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:48:40


Hmmm... stupid reason or legitimate reason?
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:06:25
Are you insinuating only ~100 people realized gains? How many people *do* you think we’re profitable with investing and then selling BTC? 
@_date: 2019-05-01 12:16:56
This sub is garbage because of posts like this.
Thanks, OP!
