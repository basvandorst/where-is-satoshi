What will happen tomorrow? After the futures expire? Predictions for Bitcoin and the entire market.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:42:41
Perhaps whales knew about this and they all sold and panic sells made it even worse and now the whales are buying back.

I am already up despite these horrible few days. I was a millionaire last week but not right now. If I go up again I am taking money out.
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:56:49
Yes for a while
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:15:27
Be happy if it ever reaches 15 000 again.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:14:12
How and why would anybody listen to that guy? Is he being serious? A hamburger and thing on his forehead. Some ”expert”.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:26:34
I lost more don't worry.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:25:52
What matters is if it increases or not. Who cares if it's around if it goes below 10 000?
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:07:51
Good luck convincing millions of people
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:08:28
I am from Sweden and have not heard anything at all about this. And no, E-krona is not a cryptocurrency. It’s just a digital Swedish krona.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:42:38
Some fear and some know people will fear and therefore sell. So it’s a 2x effect. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:48:54
Because of 5 minutes? Don’t get your hopes up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:00:40
I decided not to panic. I am still many dollars up. So I would love to see everything rising again. Next year I will probably sell 2 weeks before christmas and buy back in january.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:45:16
I am focused on getting a profit...
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:18:07
It had a good run from November to 8th January then it died.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:39:41
It's because of the media. It's always the media. They wrote about some investor having millions of dollars in bitcoin an hour ago.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:45:49
Bitcoin controls the entire market. If Bitcoiins falls everything falls......
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:41:29
I think we might see BTC at 9000 today
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:19:09
9000 dollars 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:57:32
Have you been raised by drunk parents or something? Is that how you talk to someone?
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:27:34
I think the value will skyrocket even more during christmas time. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:00:22
I disagree. It’s dropping now.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:09:26
I have 1.20798633
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:40:42
Okay I marked your words. And when you are wrong what will happen?
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:12:07
Between 3000-8000
@_date: 2019-03-01 19:50:42
Why would you be happy with people losing money unless you personally have experience of them doing bad things to you?
@_date: 2019-03-12 10:04:16
You need some cookies
@_date: 2019-03-07 08:14:22
A year ago BTC was 8400 so what are you even talking about... edit, lol at all you idiots downvoting a fact, not an opinion.
@_date: 2019-03-16 18:16:54
so 40 dollars a week? you are basically just losing on the buying fee....
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:14:25
Yep, point that finger at the toilet because that's how accurate your claim is.
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:26:59
We will see
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:13:29
Listen. It won’t be 60000 are you a newbie?
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:04:54
Btc won’t be 100k stupid kid
@_date: 2019-02-08 15:02:53
IF BTC goes up everything goes up. If 1 coin goes up that coin only goes up....
@_date: 2019-02-01 11:07:22
Every night you dream of exactly 211000?
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:13:02

@_date: 2019-02-26 08:36:08
What do you think? The secret whales are co-operating.
@_date: 2019-06-08 19:07:30
Hope so
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:58:52
What are you talking about? Is it a better mentality to not sell when it went from 17K to 3K lol.... I have 4 BTC. Buy and sell at a profit. That's how I work now. I already lost 120 000 dollars of profit money.
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:52:48
Wow everything exploded. Wish I bought yesterday. But still made around 400 dollars in 5 minutes now. Better than nothing.
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:20:03
Neo has been at 9-14 dollars for over 6 months while everything else went 3x
@_date: 2019-02-26 16:28:54
Why sell? Just put a stop limit 1% lower than the current value. If it goes down you will automatically sell.
@_date: 2019-02-19 15:35:50
Looool 12K in 1.5 months. That’s just plain stupid.
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:46:21
Because I don’t care. It’s just profit money. I took out my investment a year ago. I can live without those 14400 dollars left.
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:11:32
You still think this isn’t just a game? It’s all controlled by whales
@_date: 2019-02-19 17:09:55
He is talking about 6 weeks not 2 years
@_date: 2019-02-21 11:59:56
25 in March... what did you drink?
@_date: 2019-02-05 00:20:42
You want to wait 307 years for BTC too? 
@_date: 2019-02-08 12:18:57
It doesn’t work like that
@_date: 2019-02-14 10:29:55
computer fault
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:04:36
Yeah tell that to me who bought at 40 and put a stop  limit at 41 4 months ago.... Would have made 35K if I would have let it go....
@_date: 2019-02-08 11:44:02
Hope so
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:05:19
What are you talking about? In Sweden you are allowed to get personalised plates... This ”BITCOIN” plate is 100% real and accepted by the government and is in use for this Tesla. I am from Sweden. Here you go. Today you learned something new. 
@_date: 2019-04-16 01:07:25
What is GBTC?
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:26:43
This will never happen and that’s why it crashed. If BTC is at 100K it will need to be at 110K to increase 10%. Pointless. The sweetspot is 2K-6K
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:56:19
Any reason for the rise from 4200 to 5300? Nothing has a reason in this market.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:33:12
They can just put a stop limit and not lose anything, stupid
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:18:33
bear trap, when you are supposed to get fooled that it's a bear market. The price plummets but only to suddenly get back up again after people sell.
bull trap, the opposite, price spikes so others will buy and then whales take out their profit and the price goes down

@_date: 2018-03-28 21:27:47
Completely different when the fact is too many people have seen their value drop 80% in two months.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:11:12
Compare the volume with 2 months ago...
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:15:57
So you put your trust in some guy in crypto? Haven’t you learned anything?
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:29:06

@_date: 2018-11-28 22:42:50
Haven’t you all noticed that all coins drop then rise again? Play the game and take advantage...
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:20:15
So is BTC’s price movement and media attention.
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:57:45
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:55:17
No it's not. How are your math skills? 6500/18000...=63%
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:04:57
Seems the other way around. When BTC goes up 500 dollars people write ”moon” despite being down 50% still.
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:36:21
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:30:36
Are you trolling?
@_date: 2019-01-07 07:17:54
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:11:25
Everything is worthless. We create ”worth” by putting a price on things. If nobody wants those things anymore then they are worthless.

@_date: 2018-02-20 06:55:16
BTC will always crash and go back up. 12000-20000 is it’s max value because once it’s there it reauires too much money to go 2x. Easier to crash it and start over.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:10:52
Saturday should be a sell day not sunday.
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:47:27
LOL, it jsut from nowhere suddelny crashed down. Is that healthy?
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:25:42
What is that?
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:58:40
What is this ntip thing?
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:47:54
Definetely not. A Countach is about 400 000 dollars.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:47:23
Bitcoin is taking over the market again. I remember when it had 32%. Now it has 39% of the total market.
@_date: 2019-01-25 20:39:15
You actually believe peoples predictions and claims here? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:00:51
It was at 19K and now at 10K. That’s not something to celebrate.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:06:12
That’s smart.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:47:35
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:03:48
The crypto market has been all about daytrading since January. Fast money...
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:15:19
Same when it goes up 100 people think it will go to 20K
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:46:19

@_date: 2018-02-20 12:41:52
Because it’s rising what do you think? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:11:44
I call you stupid now. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 10:50:21
Nothing, it's just guessing and claims.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:51:49
Not really. Holidays coming up and it went from 11700 to 9300 just 7 days ago
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:52:53
The new one is the OP who says it's healthy. I am in since November 2017.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:13:29
Only reason people incourage others to buy the dip is so BTC won't crash hard. Why would you otherwise try to ''help'' others making money?
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:44:47
That’s not what I was talking about really. It dropped like a stone in water. So fishy. And now it’s going up from out of nowhere.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:59:14
No it's not. You are writing your comment in the present. It's like I would write ''you are dead.'' Because I automatically assume you will die one day. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:41:58
Look at the volume... It’s dead.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:17:47
Let’s see. Holidays tomorrow. It might explode or crash.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:17:49
I also knew.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:37:43
You never know when it has finished crashing
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:16:40
email was not made to make people money
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:37:14
When I bought it went down as usual. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:32:43
And if it goes down? Point is, don't care what others do. Mind your own business.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:46:48
I don’t think so. But we will see.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:19:36
What even happened? Why a sudden drop at an exact moment? This is nothing more than a casino. It’s all manipulated.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:30:00
To hell
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:45:57
That’s what happened in January and it worked...
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:16:37
By December crypto is banned
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:06:45
Bmw and Audi? Pffff.
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:39:04
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:16:16
What's your point? Crashing from 29 to 3 is no big deal because the market cap was extremely small then.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:20:38
If this was a whale he would need somwhere between 500-1000 BTC
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:43:57
This has no meaning
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:15:55
Or because you are not stupid and want to cut your losses...
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:24:56
You condradict yourself. Overvalued=it won’t go higher=harder to get gains.
That’s why it went down so it could start over again.
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:56:06
What are you talking about? Europe woke up now.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:44:10
what ban?
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:12:01
Stop looking in the past
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:14:25
why would tether do that when it has proven to be stable for over 1 year while BTC has shown how unstable it has been every day?
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:39:49
So he can get at least 50 000 duh
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:56:51
If that’s the logic and everyone would do that then there would be no runs.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:13:12
I wonder if I can make a profit... Bought at 8865. Hopefully it won't be down when I wake up. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:21:12
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:47:08
When it goes from 11700 to 6500 they cry. When it goes from 6500 to 7400 they act like they won the lottery despite being so much down.
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:08:22
I should have tethered all I had in January. Lost 90% since then.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:15:52
Had you sold in december you would be up 3300% so see yourself as a greedy loser
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:28:09
No I don't think we are on the way to 20K. But that's me. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:04:34
It’s green compared to 24h ago. Compare with 7 days ago and cry
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:42:34
Me too
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:21:40
Liftoff? One month ago BTC was higher than today...
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:12:00
WHy would you think 7800 will make it rise like an explosion? What kind of logic is that? It will go down and up. There are no numbers to look for.
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:01:30
The crypto market is not about holding. It's about easy daily profits.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:00:27
Maybe 9000 sunday 
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:00:30
Hope so. Want to see it at below 3000. Then you can make big profits.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:28:41
If BTC goes to 200 dollars and such it will be extremely easy to go 5-10x and become super rich. I hope I will see it near that.
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:03:42
Loss of faith. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:34:49
Never get anybody involved. Because if it goes down you will be their enemy for life. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:23:32
Bubbles only have 1 bull run. It’s over.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:02:22
I bought and lost 500 dollars right away...
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:58:39
I never listen to any advice in crypto
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:41:37
Because people are stupid and think if it goes up 400 dollars it will keep going up. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:26:08
Bought at 7300 and it sky rocketed to 7550. Have put a stop limit at 7500. Feels good.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:04:00
Well they are idiots
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:22:31
I have tethered since 9000. It didn’t go up.
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:06:58
Doesn’t matter what you would hace done with the money after you sold it. At the moment you sold it you would be 3x richer than if you sold today.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:52:52
3300 in 1 week
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:08:21
It’s not really down more. It is 1/10 of it’s highest ever. While Neo if 1/20 for example.
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:53:33
If you just put a stop limit you won’t lose. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:43:45
Yeah because BTC was also doing fine. Alts always go up higher but lose more when BTC gets down. So what is your point...
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:17:48
Because when did BTC ever pump more than any other coin...
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:30:46
It’s going up so what’s the problem? It’s all about making money.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:15:23
Basically he meant ”it will go up or down” and he is fully correct.
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:46:30
If you invested in 2016 you should have put a stop limit at 17000 and you would have been rich
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:44:21
Where is the daily discussion ?
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:05:21
So in other words you do care
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:08:20
I didn’t but at least I made a profit. I could have had 120K more
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:31:08
He is just a hater. Buy whatever you feel will go up. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:25:59
I did and I take that back.
@_date: 2018-12-22 00:40:26
This time in 2017 people said december 2018 it would be 100K.... 
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:43:11
You call people idiots while saying ”your”...
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:51:41
What is natural in crypto? Everything is manipulated. Play your cards right and sell when you are on +
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:42:26
Not at all. Look at what altcoins values were before BTC pumped in 2017. BTC went about 18x but they went 100-200x
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:44:23
What is even Matic Network? Up over 2x in a couple of days.
@_date: 2018-12-31 00:26:35
Lol. 70-150K. Bitcoin had a typical bubble graph and you still think it will reach 150.
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:14:41
100000 x what it is now
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:45:07
No it is not. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:06:58
But it won’t, 
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:32:59
They were at least much closer to being correct and they still are.
@_date: 2018-12-24 21:12:44
Nobody knows
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:32:18
i did the same mistake. didn't even know what tether was or stop limit and lost 115 K in profit money
