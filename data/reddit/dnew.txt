Of course not. Because it's not a receipt. If you went up to someone and asked "are you aware the federal government creates, debates, votes on, and publishes a budget every year, and if it isn't finished in time, the government 'shuts down'?" I bet at least 80% of fairly educated people would know that.


Sure. That's where the articles come in. Who would you trust to explain it, if not third parties reading the hard numbers?


But that's why we have laws and shit that regulate what the government does. Obviously the people in power would prefer to have no checks on their power at all. You can't conclude from that that there's no checks on their power.


The Fed is not the government. They're a private institution. They're scum. :-)


Except you're wrong, because that would be unconstitutional. And it makes major news, including front-page headlines, every time the budget risks being late.

So, they pay taxes, but will never receive the social security benefits those taxes would otherwise entitle them to, and you think that's *good* for them?

You really think this stuff isn't published? Seriously?

According to the legislation of the government, backed by the use of force more overwhelming than you're willing to dispute. Welcome to the world in which violence is effective.
Next time someone stabs you, tell the knife it doesn't have the authority to cut you.
And before you complain that violence works, that's where the conversation goes once you start denying that the government has authority over you, because you've made "authority" a meaningless word.

Governments are not humans. Corporations are not humans. Corporations are not governments. The fact that the economic accounting of various entities don't match doesn't make it wrong.

Maybe you should move to a country where the democratically elected, intelligent government workers actually work well, instead of assuming it's simply impossible.

It doesn't really help to dispute it to *me*.


And that's why they're proposing passing laws that prevent that.


I think we all agree there. But to not follow their rules in changing the rules means you're willing to use violence to change the rules, which is unlikely to work out for you if you're doing it alone.

Once NASA figured out how to do it, it became more cost effective for private industry to replicate it in areas where the research wasn't extensive.

They already have the authority. Refusing to validate it doesn't keep them from arresting you.

Except without that pesky federal regulation.

No. I'm asserting that if you don't want to work within the system, that's your alternative. I'm all for reducing the intrusion of government. That said, I suspect I'm making this reply to the wrong thread. Sorry. :-) There's someone else asserting the government doesn't have the authority to do what they're doing, and I think i got confused.

You don't have to pay any taxes. They're voluntary. You just get opted out of protection against violence, use of the banking system, etc., because the government declines to sell its services a la carte. Just ask David Koresh.

Selling *is* the transaction.

You know why the USA got a second constitution in 1789?

The other people who read it aren't going to take up arms against the government either.


But not willing to use violence to defend them against the government. And that's my point. Telling people they shouldn't use the existing rules to change how the rules work is a disservice. You get more people blustering about how they're going to overthrow the government rather than getting them to vote.

If they're the fiat issuers, I don't see why you'd need proof-of-work mining to make it work. It doesn't need to be any more decentralized than current banking ACH networks are.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:01:32


Then you haven't provided for your own defense, now have you?
You seem to be complaining that violence works to get people to do what you want them to do.


No we don't. That would be infeasible. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:21:12


Of course you are. You just have to then provide for your own defense, your own currency, etc. Just ask David Koresh.


Of course you are. What kind of imprisonment are you in that you can't emigrate? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:03:29


You said it isn't transparent, and there's no receipt. Both are literally incorrect. I don't expect the average citizen to make sense of where four billion dollars is spent by three million employees, no, regardless of whether it's government or a business like Amazon or Google or Verizon.


Nonsense. Google "federal budget" and you'll get hundreds of hits explaining it all. Indeed, I had to wander around for 5 or 10 minutes just to find an authoritative site that *wasn't* a third-party analysis.


The fact that the government does things with its money that you disagree with doesn't mean you don't know what it's spent on. Indeed, *you know this is happening* even though it would obviously be preferable to those involved that it stays quiet, right?
Fuck, man, think about it. The budget is four trillion dollars. You know several (let's say four) million has gone missing. You know where everything is being spent down to one dollar out of a million. Otherwise, you wouldn't know that a millionth of the money was missing, right? How can you say it is the least transparent part of the government?

Awesome. I didn't know that. I knew you could write off losses from illegal gambling, but I never really considered whether that would generalize.
Makes sense, I guess. If you're going to income from illegal business venture, you might as well treat it like any other business adventure.  "Itemized: $6000 of condoms.  Who, me? No, I'm just out getting some fresh air."

There's a line on our income tax forms for declaring criminal proceeds.

Correct. But I find it amusing you don't have to tell them where it came from, because Fifth Amendment. Only that you collected it.
@_date: 2015-04-03 06:12:03
No, I think they're saying that they don't have to tell you you're accused of a crime that could get your assets frozen because you might move all your assets the moment you hear that.
Just like they don't tell you your phone is tapped when they tap it, nor do they tell you they're on their way to arrest you the moment they issue the warrant.

That's not why. Religion and politics are controversial for two reasons:
1) Pretty much everyone involved gets the same one. The reason people don't argue over whether chinese or italian food is better is everyone can pick your own. But there's only one set of laws for any given large group, and most modern religions state that they're right for everyone even if there are others to choose from.  (There were very few religious wars back in polytheistic days; that's what the "When in Rome..." quote is about.)
2) Unlike science, there's no way to prove which religion or political system is better. There's no way to do an experiment where half your citizens get one government and the other half gets a different government and the two don't interact enough to corrupt what you were trying to test in the first place. Clearly rich people get a different government than the poor people do, but the rich and poor interact enough that you can't conclude what would happen if everyone were rich or everyone were poor.

I think that's generally more arguing over the interpretation of the evidence than it is arguing over the evidence. Anyone can see exactly what evidence the LHC created. It's just a question of what it means.
But sure. My point is that everyone can tell when your battery efficiency has improved because your knowledge of quantum chemistry has worked out nanojunk. But you can argue all you like over who is right about the afterlife (very limited (with many saying no) evidence so far) or whether gun control laws actually are the cause of fewer gun injuries (because you can't control the variables of or replicate your studies). And because everyone is stuck with the decisions made, in general.
