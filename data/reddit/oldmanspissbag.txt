It's not even that he's a bad economist because if you were to assume that Bitcoin's supply could be easily exhausted, then his analysis would be right.
He's just assuming something without reason because he seemingly has very little understanding of the actual dynamics of Bitcoin and how it works.
So his economics is right, it's just that it's all rooted in a faulty understanding of how Bitcoin works.

In the long-run, probably not. In the short-term, however, a lot of people would suffer some significant losses -- including damaged egos. 
Most importantly, I think the short-term financial losses could be hard on a lot of people. In an economic sense, it's equivalent to people in a dying industry losing their jobs due to automation. In the grand scheme of things, it's for the best, but that doesn't really help the people who lost their jobs.
The same goes for the people who lose their savings after a hardfork due to petty politics.

Pretty cool deal. It'll be interesting to see how Bitcoin is actually affected by this in the long run.

Why isn't OTC trading as popular in the US? Will it ever become a more seriously considered choice for bitcoin trading in the States?

What do you think of the company? Is it a scam, a bad business model, or something else entirely?
