Yes, there's a chance it could never be confirmed because it wasn't sent with a high enough fee. You don't want to do anything until the transaction is confirmed. Also due to the feature called "replace by fee" which allows you to rebroadcast a transaction with a higher fee one could simply rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee and redirect the funds back into their wallet thus robbing you.

this... doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:30:35
I disagree. What if I’m moving $5? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:47:56
This makes no sense. Is bitcoin not deployed then? of course it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:48:25
Compare the number of inputs and outputs, should explain the difference. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:53:54
Make a better system

If Bitcoin Cash blocks were to get full at the current max of 8mb then would they have overtaken Bitcoin? If my math is correct (it might not be) that would be around 22 transactions per second assuming 600 byte avg transactions size. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:25:47
No room for logic here 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:22:28
Correct me if I’m wrong but can they even do it? Thought exchanges just exchange one currency for another and since bitcoin is the underlying currency that the lighting network uses they would just continue to exchange bitcoin for USD or whatever other currency 
Maybe it would just be when you withdraw 
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:54:18
irrelevant 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:34:08
Why must we constantly compare ourselves to BCH? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:35:06
Time will tell, will be interesting to watch what happens. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:24:47
They are too busy working on alt coins is my belief 
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:31:24
ahh the old slippery slope argument. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:46:32
Ethereum has hard forked in the past without issue and has more planned for the future. We are talking about hard forking to update not break off to form a new coin.

What does he have to do with this? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:53:12
Conspiracy theory much?
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:49:09
“You’re using it wrong”
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:49:45
Are they though? What have they learned?
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:41:14
I don’t understand what you’re even trying to say 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:07:33
Umm no fee we’re actually high for a period of time 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:15:48
is bitcoin core actually using bech32 addresses across the board?
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:11:00
You can sell to people in person 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:43:47
What are they supposed to do now? LN doesn't exist in the real world yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:34:05
What changed? Why are the fees going down?
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:25:35
I don’t understand that if a solution is simple then the dev must be “lazy”. Ever heard of the kiss rule? I feel like people are like we must outsmart this thing for some reason instead of doing what works 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:06:08
Yes it’s normal 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:59:55
But according to some people (not me) I thought LN made it so you don't need to increase the block size. If you will eventually need to increase the block size why not just increase it now?

Shapeshift.io has ripple no account required just need a ripple wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:26:09
If all this has to be done then they blew it 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:01:56
So what't the point of Bitcoin then if you never go "on chain" 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:06:36
so... is that not true? is bcash actually not a different project?
