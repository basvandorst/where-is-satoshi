That article is about target profiling their customers' purchases to send them coupons or other advertisements. It has nothing to do with specific prescription medications being sent to Visa/MV just by making a purchase in a pharmacy. 
And for that matter, what makes you so certain that an online pharmacy that was just setup yesterday and is obviously operating on the edges of legality (if not completely outside of it) is going to protect your data? 
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:57:56
That sounds very brave and principled of you, except that you said in the thread yesterday that there was no possible way to ever prove it was Ulbricht who ordered the hit. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:59:08
Specific medications aren't listed on a credit card statement, only that a purchase for X amount amount was made at ABC pharmacy. So unless you're shopping at  Big Bob's Boner Pill Emporium and Taxidermy Shop, Visa will not know what you bought.

You write off 3-4 million cell phones like it's nothing.  Maybe it's a small amount compared to the total number of phones in user, but that's still a shitload of people that you're writing off by saying "too bad, so sad".  Oh, and how many more stolen cell phones do you think there would be if thieves knew that once they had the phone there was literally nothing else that would stop them from stealing all of the vicitim's bitcoins?  No chargebacks, no proactive fraud monitoring, no chance of the account being disabled. 
The most recent chargeback I did was this past summer.  Purchased something from an online merchant, returned it (as allowed by their policy), no refund.  I send a couple of emails that they ignore.  Fuck that shit, I'm not wasting my time getting the runaround.  Chargeback, done.
A year or 2 ago I bought a cellphone from a store that specialized in no-contract phones.  Told the store owner I had ATT and wanted something that was LTE capable, he sells me a Samsung phone (I forget the exact model).  The phone doesn't get LTE, and I find out that it's a European model that doesn't run on the LTE frequencies in the US.  The store says no backsies.  File a chargeback, they quickly change their mind.
But you know what, it doesn't matter how many examples I come up with, or even if I don't have any.  I am just one person out of the billions of people with credit cards.  Are you really going to say that none of them ever had a legit reason to chargeback?  Somehow these banks spend $$$ on a huge infrastructure to process and manage chargebacks, when it's all totally unnecessary?  
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:59:37
If I lose my credit card or it gets stolen, I call the bank, any transactions that are not mine are cancelled, they send me a new card, and I'm on my way.  If I am understanding you correctly, a person who is unfortunate enough to have their phone stolen can have their bitcoin wallet cleaned out without recourse of any kind.  So how is that a better system?
Your statement about the only "TRUE" reason for chargebacks...you're full of it.  I've charged hundreds of thousands of dollars to my credit cards over the years, and even though I have only had to resort to chargebacks a handful of times, I promise you that they were for legit reasons.  When you get screwed over by merchant, you come to appreciate the peace of mind in knowing that you always have the ability to take the dispute to your issuing bank, and that they will go to bat for you.  Shit, I would expect someone who has witnessed all the thefts/disappearances of bitcoin by various shysters would understand that consumer protections may be a good thing.
But no, the *ONLY* reason for chargebacks is to ripoff companies according to you.  You better get in touch with VISA, Mastercard, and Amex and tell them that their [lists of chargeback reasons]( can be cut down to just one.

@_date: 2015-01-03 03:43:47
Guess what else....Even if prices are higher due to chargebacks, the price paid is still the same for everyone.  In other words, people like you paying with bitcoin (or cash) are subsidizing my ability to chargeback, even though they won't be able to chargeback if something goes wrong with their transaction.  So thank you!
Interest...same thing.  I don't pay it, so the people that do are helping me out.
Annual fees...I do have one card w/ a $59 annual fee, so you got me there.  But the rewards more than make up for the fee.  I just cashed in 2 years worth of points for our weeklong Caribbean cruise in March.  Pretty good trade if you ask me.
It's almost as if credit cards can be useful if you know how to play the game responsibly!

If you want to consider money to be an illusion, fine. But what isn't an illusion are the things you can buy with money. And in that regard, bitcoin has a long, long way to go. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:52:19
The US has been printing dollars.  Even with the influx of cash into the economy with QE, there is no shortage of demand for US treasuries. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:45:48
Except it's not like protecting cash or gold at all. Cash and gold are physical assets, so as long as they are in your hands you know that you control them. For extra safety you can put them in a safe, a bank deposit box, under the mattress, whatever. As long as someone else doesn't get their hands on it, you're safe. That's a simple concept that everyone understands. No need to follow lengthy how-to documents about standing up a completely offline PC with an expoxied ethernet port for bitcoin storage. 
With bitcoin you have to have a certain degree of technical competence that most people don't have to keep your money safe. And even then, look how many thefts/losses are incurred by bitcoin advocates or even the exchanges themselves.
@_date: 2015-08-03 14:19:05
It has value in that it can be exchanged for other currencies, such as the US dollar.  Which I would do immediately because a) the exchange rate is so volatile and b) there are very few things that can be bought with bitcoins, and even fewer that can be bought without jumping through hoops to convert it to fiat somewhere along the way. 
The fact that you chose to measure the value of bitcoin in dollars shows which one has more value. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:12:00

@_date: 2015-10-08 23:14:59
Maybe, but that's by no means guaranteed.
But regardless, it's yet another layer of highly improbable things that would have to happen for Ulbricht to ever see the outside of prison again.
@_date: 2015-10-30 16:30:21
There is plenty of evidence, not to mention that the hits were not denied by the defense. Instead they tried to explain them away as "role playing".   It's amazing that you want to deny Ross ordered the hits, when even he isn't denying them. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 21:26:30
I'm going to assume you meant DPR instead of DBR, in which case Ulbricht admitted to being DPR in the trial, which also disproved his claim that there was more than one DPR.
By undisputed, I mean that the evidence of these hits was presented at his trial and Ulbricht did not dispute that he requested the hits or sent the payment for them.  He only claimed that he was "role-playing", which as the judge noted is a ridiculous claim when you see he sent $500k to the hitman.
I don't know why you would even entertain the possibility that any of the evidence was planted, when not even Ulbricht's defense made that assertion.
@_date: 2015-10-30 09:05:13
Not especially.... What's your point? 
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:02:53
Ok, I see now. You *are* being intentionally obtuse. I'm sure you know as well as anyone that of course Ross was not convicted of the hits because he wasn't tried for them. The trial for those is pending in Maryland, although I'm sure the government is in no hurry to move forward since Ulbricht isn't leaving his cell anytime soon. 
But contrary to your assertion that the government has no evidence, there *was* ample evidence of the hits presented in the trial. The blockchain transaction I posted above, Ulbricht's own journal entries, not to mention his absurd assertion that it was just "role play" (even though he sent the hitman $500k of bitcoins). 
Just because he wasn't convicted in court of the hits doesn't mean we have to put blinders on and pretend there is a 0% chance it happened. A rational person that isn't trying to deify Ulbricht can look at the existing (and undisputed) evidence and say that he obviously did order the hits. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 23:07:10

And look at what the murder-for-hire apologist did here.  Acts like Ulbricht is a saint and anyone who believes he ordered the hits is crazy, then when he gets called out with the facts and evidence, he deletes his comments and runs.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:53:43

@_date: 2015-02-07 19:38:57

It needed to be solved **before** you stored a single credit card number  on your systems. 


I don't think you do understand. Visa publishes detailed specs for merchants on what is and is not compliant. It's not something you just "hope" for. 


Yeah, I guess there was no way to research this or test it on your own. Thankfully you have reddit comments to keep you informed. 


Here's some feedback: stop reading reddit threads and start reading official compliance documents published by the credit card companies.
