You’re right. “Buying with a long time horizon” then

What are some qualities that you think make this dip different?

Oh man, I hope you're a Subban fan from before the Preds! Let's go Pens....

This was exactly what I was looking for, I'm very interested to watch your predictions this week!

*bitcoin will fall* THIS GUY KNOWS NOTHING
*bitcoin will rise* WE FOUND A GENIUS

Would this not already be priced in if we already know exactly what the activation will do and when it will happen?

You're right, hard to complain about a 15% drop when it's up so high this year. I'm just wondering if the dip will eventually wipe gains I was lucky to have or if it's just a bump in the road.

Haha you're right, just chump change, but unfortunately I don't have too much extra money lying around as a student.

You're definitely right, just trying to build on the experience of others. Thanks for the recommendation!

You're right about all of that, but there were also inaccuracies, most glaringly the quote that "the blockchain could be hacked," which is different from simply sharing a differing opinion

What is he point of setting a date? It’s fine to take a long position and ride out dips, but trying to prove how much of a hodler you are is ridiculous. Even the stickied post cautions against reckless investing. Who know what could happen in over two years?
Take a long position if you think bitcoin has reason to keep climbing, but trying to get positive reinforcement about not selling from a group that is in the same boat as you is pretty risky.
