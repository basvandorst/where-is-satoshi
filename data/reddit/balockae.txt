Most individuals don't need to operate a full node. Better pruning and SPV improvements make this even more true. Again, if we can even scale 1tps more and increase network capacity with near zero downsides why wouldn't we? December 2017 could have been supported 2017, far less than 2000tx/sec. 
I think sound money is just innately wanted by even the common person. What happened in December 2017 was not what sound money look like. 
Bitcoin, if the blocksize is doubled, will have amazing ux until a long way down the road. 0-conf is really good and should be embraced more. There are certainly some things wallet side that should be done to really seal the deal with the common person, but that's not a network capability issue.
It's not "so what" and it's not something we should settle for. Custodial wallets are likely going to dominate and it undermines the foundation of Bitcoin's utility. Exchanges are an unfortunate thing we have to deal with, but atomic swaps and decentralized exchanges fix that. Bitcoin cannot spare amazing ease of use after what has already happened. 
LN doesn't seem needed right now, nor ready. Hoping for that to change though.

I apologize, I did misspeak but it doesn’t negate my point. The “On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains” paper says 4MB wouldn’t harm 90% of nodes. 
BUT you have remember this was before compact blocks. A technology like graphene would mean an event higher potential limit. 
There is no excuse to keep the block size where it is when we can raise it without decentralization issues.

Regardless of how far on chain scaling can take us, it’s clear we can scale much farther than the current network. Even going to 7Mb wouldn’t effect decentralization. We can decide what to do after that. Maybe there is better solutions than what an unfinished product with these legitimate UX issues has.

Thank you! Very interesting.. I think may also be a technical issue, a lot of the beauty of Bitcoin is burried is technology and burried in some principals of money that most people don't even second guess.

I would disagree with this. I get the overall concept of Bitcoin. I am not good at explaining, and people don't get, why Bitcoin is better than your average currency. I actually have had no choice but to use Bitcoin in some situations, so I would say I understand the need for not pretty well.

Well some of the good from using Bitcoin is technical, and it is hard to transfer that over to people who don't understand that. People tend to not think ahead, and not to question their current currency. I think this is a huge problem when getting Bitcoin more mainstream, and simplifying anything is a difficult problem, especially something like Bitcoin. I do feel though it needs to be shared, it is an amazing concept whether people disagree with it or not, and its survival depends on popularity over other coins.
