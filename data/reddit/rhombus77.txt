If we all listened to the trolls it would be a terrible world indeed.  I usually don't read comments anymore (or at least put my troll filter on).  Thanks again for taking the time to inform and muse.

Site down?

I would seriously look into adding Armory to bitcoin-qt.  Create on offline ("cold storage") address on a computer that will never touch the internet.  Then on your second, internet connected computer, you can add Armory and add the offline wallet address, so you can view the balance.  I would transfer all the BTC that I want to save to this address.

try using coinbase-trader.  Works for me.  
@_date: 2013-07-17 19:59:03
I have a coin or so in Havelock.  So good so far.  They have answered all my questions quickly too

If I remember correctly, make sure you click on the import/export link before going offline so it is cached in your browser.  Then go offline.  The instructions were outdated when I did it a month ago.  Let me see if I can find the link for current instructions

Excellent!

Offline wallet.  Armory.

I always considered those sites pyramid scheme of sorts.  A few people make a little bit of money, but then the magic item (bar in this case) resets and goes back to the original owner and repeats.

1μBTC = 0.000001BTC
81.8μBTC = 0.0000818BTC
$92.75/BTC * 0.0000818BTC = $0.00758695

horde and loan a bit on BTCJam.

this is what i use for my "savings".  I keep my spending on blockchain.info's online wallet
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:57:15
That makes sense now.  To the VM.  I should have thought of that to begin with.  Thank you.
edit:  that did the trick.  Thanks for the link.  I needed to upgrade to nodejs like you said
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:17:24
I use blockchain.info to keep a small amount of spending money.  The rest I send to an offline wallet.  I use this software:   My offline wallet was created on a computer that hasn't touched the internet.

If you are running Windows, you are going to need to setup VirtualBox and run Ubuntu in it to get the script working.  If you need help with the setup, PM me.

"A deterministic wallet [Armory] can be backed up by simply copying the starting seed value to a secure location, and this **only needs to be done once**. If the wallet ever gets lost, all private and public keys can be regenerated from the initial seed."
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:46:35
Agreed.

I believe Campbx is 0.55% per trade.  Transfer to Dwolla and then to your bank account is $0.25.

I am not sure about the greater whole, but personally, I usually transfer a larger portion of a coin (0.2BTC) to my dust accounts, let it sit for a day or two then send the total to my savings.  Even if the dust is used up in the fee to the miners, I figure it should go somewhere.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:25:48
As far as I know you will have to run a virtualization of linux on Mac.

I have bought all my coins from coinbase, but immediately transfer them.  Like Justusranvier posted, use an offline wallet (Armory).

How are you out anything?  I am assuming your fiat is still in your account.  Frustrating?  Yes.  Getting fucked?  No

Cold storage is basically a savings account you don't dip into.  A paper wallet is one method of cold storage.  [link](

Put option, perhaps?!

I was able to purchase this morning at 0847MST, although it states it will be pending until the 28th.

Armory was effing up after the new update.  I ended up installing the MSVC++ 2008 Redistributable package 
    *Some Windows users have reported that Armory will not run without the MSVC++ 2008 Redistributable package from Microsoft.  If you are experiencing problems loading Armory in Windows after a fresh install, please download and install that package.
It is on the armory download page under windows installers.  Hope that helps

I have five delinquent payments i will never see.  Good thing i lent less than half a coin total.  Never again.

If you are handy with Ubuntu grab a program called Coinbase-trader.  It will try to place a buy order every minute until the transaction goes through
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:03:52
Coinbase for me.  I have never had any issues and have purchased the majority of my btc from them

Raeene, do you have a cellphone?  
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:24:52
I think they are speaking of the wallet available through 
I have one of those.  I eventually went with an offline, "cold storage" wallet for my savings.  
I had an old netbook sitting around and installed Ubuntu on it specifically for cold storage

I learned my lesson on BTCJam.  Luckily I only invested 0.5 BTC, but that was towards the beginning of the +$200 run.  I spread the investments out (micro microloans!) with the hopes of rolling over the profits into more investments.  Six of nine have gone unpaid.  I was fortunate though.  I invested what I felt comfortable losing
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:56:23
I was wondering about this myself.  Great idea
