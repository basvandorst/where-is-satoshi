Why do you say it is a huge flop?
4.56% of the population have claimed their share and every single media here in Iceland has been reporting about this new creyptocurrency thing for three days straight. There is now a whole nation exposed to crypto currency. 
Also interesting to watch the number of nodes increasing since the airdrop

I agree, it is risky and completely crazy. Although, If he has good intentions and actually goes through with the plan without "making some easy money" for himself the experiment could be an amazing success.
Either way, the last thing I would call the attempt is lazy. The amount of work he put into the project and airdrop mechanism is quite amazing and he is still responding to each and every request as he can as well as educating 330.000 people about crypto currencies.

People need to realise the potential of Auroracoin.

Auroracoin did not suffer a 51% attack. It was all a misunderstanding as BCX did not expect multipools arriving with huge amounts of hashrate and immediately came to the conclusion that it was malicious.
People using aur are asking why and what happened and what a fork is, spawns more curiosity. People need to know the dangers of 51% and how the system is secured. Crypto is not magic.
I think no one will risk setting up an official currency exchange here in Iceland. I am pretty sure it would be shut down immediately. I have been in the media a lot recently and have encouraged people to try to go buy some bitcoin as well with their aur. I truly want a world currency but it seems things like this are going to happen. If people see more value in using bitcoin they will convert, but keep in mind once you are in the crypto world, there is much less friction.

There are capital controls in the country. Nobody is able to send out money to foreign exchanges to buy btc. Even though the country is very tech-savy there has been almost no discussion on bitcoin because of this. Auroracoin is a gift to every person in Iceland, now about 7% of the population have claimed this gift and it has resulted in huge discussion about crypto currencies and people are trading auroras everywhere. 
The bitcoin commuity does not realise that the whole country is exposed to crypto currencies and could possibly start using them in the near future. That truly is good news and HUGE.

People in Iceland can not legally buy Bitcoins. 
If Aurorcoin has any value at the time of the airdrop a lot of people will be interested in getting that "free money". By taking the time to learn about how to get some aur, many people will get interested in crypto currency and could spawn a huge discussion about this thing called bitcoin.

All clients seem to agree on one blockchain. This is FUD. The planned fork worked as many multipools kicked in with the right version.

I think it's sad so many people support what he is doing. I hate premined scam coins just as much as the next guy. But BCX has prematurely decided that the 50% can not possibly go to the Icelandic population and a person holding all that money will surely cash it out himself. 
There is still no evidence that Baldur is cashing out and we should give him  and the project a chance until anything suspicious happens. In the meantime I will continue warning everyone in the media here in Iceland of the dangers of one man keeping so much of the currency and how everything could fail because of a man like BCX.
No one is able to buy Bitcoins because of capital controls here in Iceland and now we finally have a chance to participate.
Over 7.1% of the population have claimed their share of Auroracoin. Almost everyone is talking about crypto currencies and learning about this new technology. The media has been reporting about Auroracoin every single day and a large market has merged. Even if everything falls tomorrow the project is a huge success in introducing a country under capital controls to the powers of crypto currencies.

We can't legally buy bitcoins, Auroracoin is an attempt to introduce crypto currencies to the population.

The scary thing is that BitcoinEXpress does not seem to be spreading FUD for the some quick gains. He genuinely wants to destroy Auroracoin, and with a botnet and enough FUD to lower hashrate he could accomplish that.
