I knew someone would take this approach, hence 


I'd much rather live in a world full of corrupt bankers than people who endorse murder for financial gain

100's of billions i'm sure, but as a percentage of total USD supply it would be less than 1% What im talking about is 45% of total market supply. Thats assuming there will be 21 milion bitcoins - which there wont be due to lost keys etc

That’s your rebuttal? 
Not a crime boss - just done my research - I suggest you do the same

The Silk Road was (comparatively speaking )a safe haven with (vendors operating good OPSEC having) little to no risk of being caught. 
The real top dogs I’m talking about that sold were always rich and would not simply stop because they made enough money
Some people are not motivated by profit, but by life and death. Maybe you should google “blood in, blood out” and it’s prevalence amongst Mexican drug cartels - many of which are known to be proactive on DNM’s.  
Whilst I don’t debate that DNM’s have made buying drugs safer for consumers, it hasn’t changed the people selling drugs. People with access to high quality wholesale drugs are vetted criminals. Period. You do not get yourself into a situation where you can sell drugs on the DNM without committing atrocities regular citizens wouldn’t dream of.  Things like murdering your competition to get more money, maybe even your boss if it means you can take his place and get you’re cocaine for 10% cheaper
