Or he bought a large position and now wants to pump it.

It has to be the easiest analogy in the world to follow and you're having a hard time. Don't blame the OP, just try thinking a little harder.

I mean, ever since the unannounced and hugely problematic way they introduced BCH, it's been painfully clear that they are working with Ver to manipulate BTC to benefit BCH.

We're helping!

Yeah, but now people are aware of BTC and there is an exponentially larger demand then there was back then. Wall Street creating ETFs and futures markets alone should keep it relatively stable/ positive.  Until they intentionally crash it themselves to clean up on short sales...

They should just receive the amount of BTC they had. Even if each BTC went down to the value of $0.01 it would still be one BTC.

 God what a scam.

How do you justify saying the price is currently low? It's within $200 of its highest price ever.

That's what he said, why did you say "No, redditor..."?
