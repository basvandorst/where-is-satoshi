To be honest, I would be buying more bitcoin at this point. He’s an idiot. Who gets their financial advice from a dope like him. The man can’t even pay his bill for his ghost town of a inauguration!

Really?! My 401K looks like shit. And my tax return this year was a huge slap in the face.

It’s a cult. Trump could shit his pants on live tv, and somehow his followers will claim it made the USA stronger.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:04:27
Then how will Trump pay the Russians?
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:30:05
I can forgive a person mistake for voting for him. He scammed a lot of voters into thinking they were getting something better. Instead all they got was a human dumpster fire. But when they still support him after all the mistakes, childish behavior and scandals! It’s like they were brainwashed. I really hope he does end up in jail.

I’m saving this post. We’ll have a nice chat in 2020 about this wonderful conversation. By the way, Trump coin is pumping right now. You should dump all your BTC and go all in.

Shitting your pants is always a losing situation
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:55:36
I’m talking about my Federal return. Which has nothing to do how much your state taxes you.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:31:50
Jesus! I’m sorry man. I had to cut off someone who I was very close too as well. He went from a pot smoking, vegan hippie to a raging racist “trump deplorable”. He actually called himself that in our last conversation.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:45:46
Sounds good then. You keep Trump and I’ll keep my Bitcoin. And if you want, you can send me all your bitcoin. Want an address you can send it to?
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:53:59
You said it brother. Trump is a human trashbag.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:53:27
Haha! Dude, you are funny. He’s almost caused a war with NK, they’re reports that the unemployment numbers are being cooked, and he’s caused the stock market to crash with his dumb tweets. If you are all for our childish man baby of a president, well then I can’t help you see the truth, and I’m not going to waste my time trying either. And I might be a “libtard” to you, but I ain’t no victim. Cause I’m going to be one of many voting this dummy out of office.

They are coming out of the wood work now!!

No official word yet on a date, but Binance made it clear the official cut off for US customers is sometime in Sept. So, hopefully Binance US will be up and running before then.
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:13:51
But your master Trump does not approve! If you keep your bitcoin, you are supporting the evil, antifa loving democrats and the fake news!!!! Trump will not love you. Send it all to me, an evil libtard to hodl. Just to show your loyalty and love to Trump. Do so, and as thanks I will send you Hilary’s deleted emails. Trust me when I say you want to read these emails. Some of them get SPICY, if you know what I’m saying. ����

Sweet baby Jesus! Are you Trumpies crazy. Like I said before. Regardless what I say, you are going to say I’m wrong. Going to the same professional accountant I’ve been using for most of my adult life means I don’t know what I’m doing? I know better enough to go to a professional to get something done right. Oh by the way, have you seen on the news today our government is going to run out of money by Sept cause of Trumps “great” tax cut? Hey, maybe when our country shits the bed, it will push the price of bitcoin to 100k. Keep your fingers crossed.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:43:10
Keep watching Fox News, buddy.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:15:54
Scary isn’t it? I have had to cut a few people I know off, cause of their insane support for him.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:37:12
Dude, you are so right!
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:36:11
I understand whatever I say, you will try to prove me wrong. I’ve been going to the same accountant for years. Every year I got a good tax return since the Clinton years. Not this year. If you still don’t believe me, I can show you my tax return, unlike your Internet Troll of a president. I don’t want to take anymore of your time, that you ‘d normally spend watching QAnon videos on YouTube.

More then any “successful businessman” should.

First of all, terrible advice. Second, Bitcoin took 8 years to get to 20k. It will hit that number again, and go even higher, but it won’t happen overnight. Regardless of what people think, the crypto market is not a “get rich over night” scheme. It’s a waiting game, just like investing in stocks. It going to high, and it’s going to go low. If you can’t sit on your bitcoin investment for at least 1-5 years, then you should not invested.
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:12:44
Socialist buy and hold Bitcoin too. Does that make Bitcoin bad now?
@_date: 2018-07-14 21:29:10
Trump for prison 2020
@_date: 2018-07-15 01:24:12
Nope. Trump is the one that should be rotting in jail. And I’m sure he will very soon.
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:25:51
Are you wearing your infowars t-shirt, with your tin foil hat on? Tell us more about Hilary’s emails. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:35:11
I’m scared of Putin’s cum dumpster, also known as our current president. I’m also afraid of the Trump Zombies like yourself. Within a matter of 2 years, you dummies turned the US into a whitetrash gas station toilet. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:23:17
Please see this threat. Dude is trying to spread FUD on Bitcoin
