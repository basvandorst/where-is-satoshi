I'm always surprised at how well disinformation works. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:13:25
Hey there. Thank you. I've only been in Bitcoin since Jan of last year. I read this, and it seems that your friend is showing a bias, under the guise of helping new people. 
This seems a little shady. I've been reading a lot of these threads recently as I am not versed in the "Reddit" world yet, but one thing that is very apparent in this Thread is that there seems to be a lot of panic about a problem that at the same time is constantly being said won't happen.
It does not seem to be dying down. If anything the last few days have amplified the Panic. None of what is going on seems right or truly informative. It feels like propaganda. 
Newcomers should first read the White Paper. 
You guys &amp; gals have a great upcoming weekend. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:10:33
Your smugness here, as well as your assumptions of me, helps to illustrate what I was saying. Thank You.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:16:05
That's not how sound judments are made, or fostered.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:33:23
You are not using "Chickened Out" Right. I think you meant, "Left Me Out" or "Moved forward without Me" or "Didn't want to include me". 
Your use of words is a perfect example of yesterdays post. So much plausible dishonesty.  
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:55:30
Yeah. We are all ignorant. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:18:47
So did you even read what I posted? Or are you just average around here?
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:10:06
Oh, okay. I'm gonna go with Bitcoin then. The realist, of the realist.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:45:35
I think it is safe to say that we have no idea what will happen. This matter of fact opinion of it not happening is disingenuous and will get you into trouble. Unless of course, you are the decider, in that case, scratch what I said.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:19:51
lol, do you know the math on a 6% downturn on 16%? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:32:44
Perhaps after the fact, I don't know, but at the time of my posting, it most certainly was what was going on. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:24:48
Don't get fooled by logical talking points...
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:23:09
So much dishonesty. :( Yet, I'm certain people with any sense of objectivity and smarts can figure this one out.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:17:13
and where on earth did you get that data?
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:19:00
Yeah, show them all, hodl till you die. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:18:22
and it's not even his own experience, which seems odd. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:03:31
Can you imagine asking a friend in the community about something, and this is how they respond? Hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:44:55
Long Live Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:05:47
Thank you for illustrating my point. Beautifully. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:37:50
Also, don't piss on an electric fence, eat yellow snow, or play in traffic. What other PSA like this can we give?

You cannot ask in here. goto google, and do a lot of looking. This place is full of Liars. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:22:29
Question absolutely everything. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:25:58
Nailed it. This post is dishonest (implied) and shows that Roger has, at the very least, a normal IQ.

It ain't over till the fat lady sings.

If only. Chicks do blow off my cock. You have no idea. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:58:46
I put in a put on downvotes yesterday. Jokes on you. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:04:32
Then they don't really welcome everything. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:04:59
I think it's funny that you're calling me the douche bag. Thank you for enlightening me. Have a great weekend. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:35:31
If you're here for answers, boy did you come to the wrong place. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:22:47
Well, one thing is for sure. We will see how that works out for you. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:04:26
Are you asking to be sure I am on "YOUR" side or on "BITCOINS" side?
The message only gets to stay if it stays ambiguous enough. Give it a couple / few days, and I'll show ya.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:43:43
You should do yourself a favor and also ask these same questions in other Crypto threads. There are a couple that allow open disscussion about it. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:27:40
I've been using a credit union for the last decade, and it has literally cost me nothing to do business with them until I started buying BTC &amp; ETH. 
They get me for foreign transaction fees every time. Usually a day or so later it shows up on my account.
I'm going to call them Monday morning, and see how they respond to it. I saw a similar story to this yesterday when a user's longtime bank discovered he was buying BTC and threatened to close his account on him. 
Will be a good chance for me to see if this is becoming the norm. I'm hoping that my credit union will be like, meh, but we shall see. 
 
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:25:05
 this one? 
Almost makes me want to open an account to just buy crypto with. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:47:00
We live in an age of, "It's everybody else's fault". 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:10:24
The way people respond to OP's question should definitely be a tell. Look at the way they flip it on him instead of answering the question. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:23:50
fake news
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:29:23
Damn dude. I picture you will sad face-itis.  
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:50:46
Oh dear. I will disengage at this point. Our wits are non-compatible. I should be ashamed of myself. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:06:58
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See ya November. (Sound Familiar?) 
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:45:02
Nothing at all to do with Airdrop. Nothing at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:21:15
You have to be joking, Right?
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:41:39
I was just trying to be silly and failed miserably. I had no idea I was being a prick. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:47:06
So if a rebuttal comes are you going to move the goal post for that too?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:19:44
Oh that's rich. This will not end well for them. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:32:31
Very good point. Would era have sufficed? 
*Also. I added another word to my dictionary today. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:05:18
Okay, I thought you were serious. I was trying to be helpful. A shocker for you I am sure.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:27:01
You guys need any more, Sliquid? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:40:58
Still not at that $1 everyone swore, promised, and ridiculed it would be on day one. Can't wait for Thanksgiving.
