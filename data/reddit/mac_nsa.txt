Shout out OP, not everyone in America can over pay for for the same vehicle produced by one mega car conglomerate. Congratulations on your new car. If this is real.

You guys always come up with the same hypotheticals. If wealthy individuals have all the money you can imagine, don't you think we wouldn't have already traveled to every country? Buy every yacht, car, land, business we wanted? After you do everything you can imagine, the only thing thats left is power. 
You can't dictate what others do in their spare time. If anything, you should reserve that anger and just keep reading about projects. The Fireside Crypto Podcast goes in depth, many other sites do as well. This ecosystem is about knowledge, keep your emotions out of it. Good luck in the markets.

TA actually works because this ecosystem isn't doing anything out of the ordinary. I mean this because we've followed btc since it's inception and it still correlates, sure to a lesser level now but it's still the same. A credible TA from someone who knows what they're doing will always be closer to being right than wrong. All these TA you find on Twitter, tradingview. Those are all amateurs trying to impress you. Real TA is helping firms, and it's paying off.
