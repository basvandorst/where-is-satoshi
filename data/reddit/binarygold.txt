I'm happy about this development. Even if it were to affect the price. But in reality it probably helps Bitcoin to go higher, because the risk factor of being associated with criminality is removed, so legitimate investors are more confident in it.

I expect bitcoins already on lightning network will trade at a slightly higher price than on-chain bitcoins, which will encourage people to move / lock up their bitcoins in an LN channel when they want to sell. Eventually, most movable bitcoins will sit in LN channels.

Theoretically yes, in practice no. You have to pay at least $10 in fees to transact it to yourself, so it only makes sense to buy at least $500 or more.

It has launched already, but there are no wallets publicly available. There are at least 4 projects with wallets about to launch, but it will take some weeks until they become available.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:40:18
C'mon folks. They said they ARE working on it now. Give them at least a few weeks before complaining.
I know segwit has been out for quite some time, but they didn't think they need to hurry working on it, because of S2X was going to provide 2x capacity, and would've given them time to implement segwit comfortably. Also, they didn't anticipate Bitcoin Cash would become relevant, again because they anticipated S2X would serve bitcoin well, and thus nobody would've cared about BCH.
Thus, they were working on S2X support, then BCH support (because it gained significant value). Next to this, they also had to upscale their own infra as fast as possible, because they had crazy user growth.
Now, they are working on Segwit, but it's not as easy as one may imagine. They not only have front facing segwit addresses, but internal systems that need to use segwit to take advantage of lower fees, and they have the vault to consider too. They need to think everything through, build it, test it, get it audited by a third party probably. This is not as easy as a wallet, it's a larger business operation, and it takes time to implement stuff.
I'm not defending them, just being realistic.
Also, why do you think offending an entity will get you anywhere? Especially I don't understand the personal attacks on the CEO. It's quite stupid to do this. He may out of spite just do everything in his power to stick it to the Bitcoin community because he was hurt so much by us. A little tact would go far guys. Think!
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:46:17
That's a pretty cool idea. Also, can you not use this same tech to open 10 channels of your own to different hubs all at once?
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:41:51
The extra benefit of LN is that once you spent from a channel, you can start receiving from others to fill it back up. You don’t need to refill it with an on-chain transaction necessarily.
On the left side you have to make an on chain transaction to receive no matter what. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:43:01
Well, try to predict where this chart will go:
I think it's safe to say that it will be at least 10x higher same time this year, thus you would be making $50 with the same hash power. And $5 in two years.
You will probably make your money back, but not much more over that. But then again, who knows... maybe hashing power will be split between another 2-3 upcoming SHA256 forked bitcoins bringing down the bitcoin difficulty and you will make a killing. :)

The higher the mountain the more fees accumulated for pending transactions. The bitcoin network can't handle the amount of interest people have, so people are trying to outbid each other to get their transactions into the blockchian by increasing the fees they are attaching to their transactions.
The higher the mountain the more fees accumulated. The last run-up was eaten up by the network during the holidays, when people transacted less. But there is not such downtime coming up any time soon in the near future, so we expect the fees to grow higher than before.

Yes, but it's excess energy on hydro plants mostly. So it's not increasing the energy consumption that much. It would've been wasted anyway.

Because the network can only handle around 400,000 transactions a day, but there is much more demand. People are willing to pay a high price to get into the largest and most secure blockchain. People are competing with their fees for the space. 
There are several projects in progress that should help, but nothing is going to relieve the fee pressure any time soon. 
It’s likely BTC will become a coin that is only used for large transactions, and won’t work for small values. For large transactions BTC works well because it has 10x volume than any other coin. But for small transactions LTC or Dash works better because they are faster and cheaper to send.

All we need is an official announcement from Core to assure people that the block size increase hard fork is planned for a certain date to calm things down. They are committed to do it according to bitcoin.org, so why not set a date now? Even if it’s in a year down the line. LN will need a blocksize increase anyway. There is no way around this and we all know it. Including Core devs. 1MB can’t serve 7B people even if it’s only a low level settlement layer.

Haha. You don’t understand still. Major miners who are doing most of the mining are next to hydro plants who use the hydro electricity. They only use the hydro generated electricity. They do not burn extra oil or coal. 
You are thinking as a regular consumer of electricity. Yes, you plugged into the grid at home can’t know where the power is coming from. But that’s not how big miners operate.

Those savings are crazy! With just two participants you get 50% reduction, and with 10 you get 90%!
I can't think of the top of my head in what situation would more than 2-3 people open a channel together all at once. It will be a limited use case I guess.
I think it's likely to happen for machine applications, not humans. For example if you want to open 300 channels to put a bunch of vending machines into operation, or something like this...

First, you can't know if tether is indeed a scam or not. It's perfectly plausible that it's all backed up with dollars. It's not that much money that it can't be real. The $2B market capital divided between 500 investors means an average of $4M. That's nothing in a world where the rich spend this much on a weekend shopping, a ring or twice as much on a wedding party.
Also, it can't be known if the rallies in BTC price after an injection new tether in the system is a result of actual money flowing in to the system, or because investors expect money coming in so they are buying in anticipation. It's very likely that investors will start buying back into BTC as soon as they see tether moving and the price would go up even if there is no actual tethers hitting the exchange. Thus, it's possible the tether movement is just a trigger, for investors waiting for any buy signal.

Vault means they are going to put your coins offline. This means it's nearly impossible to steal them even if Coinbase is compromised, because the keys are in a bank safe somewhere.

I think you misunderstand how LN works. In practice you open 3-4 channels with specific or random nodes, and then you can access practically any other LN nodes because the payment can hop through several nodes to reach the destination.
You do not need to open a channel with every merchant you want to transact with. You can, in order to guarantee with certainty that the payment goes through 100% of the time and to lower your fees to the absolute minimum (zero), but you don't have to. Using routing you will be successful 99%+ of the time even without a direct channel, and you will only have to pay 1-2 Satoshi per hop. People use routing on LN most of the time, and they pay like 1-10 Satoshis for a transaction.
Your idea of increasing the frequency is possible like on Litecoin (2.5m instead of 10m), but it increases the orphan rate, which is problem for miners because they end up mining blocks that are not rewarded, and these also create potentially dangerous "forks" in the network. Also, doing this doesn't solve the decentralisation issue. If you mine 2x or 4x as fast, you also increase the blockchain size 2x or 4x faster, thus you end up making running a full node harder. The solution must involve a second layer which doesn't increase the blockchain faster.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:20:01
No. You don’t get it. It’s excess waste energy. Let’s say you have a turbine that generates 20 units and can only sell 15 to industry and the population. Yet it has 5 left to sell. It’s being produced, it’s going to be wasted no matter what. So they sell it to miners. 
It’s not like they have to burn more oil or coal. It’s a hydro or solar plant that makes x amount of energy when there is water or sun available.
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:32:43
Well, you're now moving the goalposts. It's an admittance of defeat.
Look, you totally have a point, but there are situations where energy production has true excess and that's the cheapest to use, and miners naturally gravitate to this cheapest source of energy.
For example, if your reservoir is full, you have to release water from it, or you will cause a flooding. At this point you can release it AND generate energy, and sell it to miners or just release it and waste the precious energy. It's not like you can fill up batteries or something. Energy storage is not solved at this scale. You're not using up a reserve. It's excess.
Another example with solar. Sometimes you have a ton of sunshine and your panels produce more than the demand can pay for. At this point you can literally shut off some of your panels so they run empty or you can sell this excess to miners. You're not using up a reserve. It's excess.
Same goes for geothermal, etc.
Coal, gas, and oil is different, but those are expensive and generally not used by Bitcoin miners.
Also, consider that because miners are ready to pay for excess, it pays back to build solar or hydro plants faster, thus they become more competitive against dirty fossils. The ability to turn a profit on green energy faster helps the green energy economy. This is especially true in the developing world like China, where a bunch of new plants are being built, and it's important what kind are built.
Bitcoin is actually a green coin. It helps the world turn to renewables. There are many things in the world that turn out to be different when you dig deeper.
Btw, I'm an engineer by profession, and I come from a long line of engineers. My fam didn't just tour such facilities, we actually designed and built them. But that shouldn't matter. Facts are facts no matter if they come from somebody like you who have only toured them, or somebody who builds them.

I don't think this will go down well. The ring is a fantasy girls have and a symbol for everyone around you. You've got to give it. You could invest in BTC besides the ring.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:02:40
Yes. But mining is just part of the decentralized nature. Verifying transactions yourself is the other important part which is something many people do.
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:39:24
Yeah, fair points.
The energy use will grow with the amount of value the network transacts. The more valuable and the more money Bitcoin secures the more energy it will use. But the correlation is not linear but logarithmic. The more valuable the Bitcoin network is, the less extra energy it will need to make it secure. So a 2x valuation increase doesn't mean the energy will increase 2x, but it will increase by a few percents only. So, yes, it's likely that the energy usage will grow several times higher in the next decades, but that's nothing if it serves the purpose of global ledger that secures the world's money and generally the digital economy.
Also, second layer solutions do not increase energy needs that much, yet scale the network capacity by magnitudes. So the per transaction energy use is dropping over time dramatically. According to merchants LN is already superseding all other altcoins in number of transactions, making up about 15% of all Bitcoin transactions. Within a year or two LN transactions will equal half of all Bitcoin transactions, and after that LN will be the majority of Bitcoin transactions, without increasing the energy consumption of the miners.
Today Bitcoin serves a few million. In the future it will serve hundreds of millions or even billions, and will generate tons of savings in the world economy in unmeasurable ways that will overall increase energy efficiency of the economy. I'm not just talking about shutting down bank branches all over the world. It's the complete redesign of e-commerce flows that optimise operations by reducing energy needs for transportation, for storage of goods, and the delivery methods, etc. It's the rise of new concepts of contracts which will reduce the needs for law enforcement, lawyers, judges, government offices, etc. This is already happening Today to an extent. When people get paid in Bitcoin for their work instead of cash, and then use Bitrefill to fill up their phone credits, they don't drive to the local store to buy phone top-up cards that need to be printed and transported to the store, and manned by a store employee. The savings are immense.
It's literally impossible to measure the savings, and especially predict them, so it's just a speculation on my part, but I think the net balance of Bitcoin will be good for the world from an environmental point of view.

@_date: 2019-07-31 08:23:55
You're referring to increasing the block size indefinitely to meet demand. You're right in a sense, it's part of the solution, but it's not about just increasing the block size on its own to increase capacity. It won't work on its own. In fact, it would be counter productive on its own.
Remember that we're not after measly 2x or 10x capacity increases. We're looking for 100x - 1000x increase to be able to serve the whole world of people and machines eventually. We are not just planning for single transactions. We want payment streaming with transactions being streamed like we stream music and movies, in return for various services. And, all this without losing the main properties that make Bitcoin valuable in the first place.
Just increasing the block size won't work without compromising the main benefits of bitcoin, which is resistance to attacks, and independence from large centralised organisations.
If we only have 50 giant full nodes around the world running on corporate networks processing 100MB+ blocks every 10 minutes, a concentrated effort by a few governments can bring them down without the ability to recover from such an attack, just like how they successfully brought down the centralised servers of file sharing sites.
If we have 100,000 nodes (as we have now) it's extremely hard and almost impossible to perform such an attack, because there will always be a few percent of users in remote corners of the world running perhaps on obscure setups like Raspis and satellites, who can't be forced to shut their nodes down. Because of this reality, it's not even worth trying to shut it down. It would only result in embarrassment, and it would only demonstrate the strength of Bitcoin making it more popular than ever.
The less nodes there are, the easier to bring the network down or to censor transactions, or to hard fork the network to include new rules. The easier it is to do that, the less value the network has, thus there are less investors, thus less miners, etc. It's a self reinforcing effect that results in the eventual destruction of the network. Thus, preventing the loss of nodes is very important.
There is a sweet spot between the number of nodes and block size, and it depends on network and tech progress. It could be less than the current 4MB, or more. On one hand, if we decrease the block size, it will create a congestion which will reduce the nodes because less people use Bitcoin. Also, if we increase the block size it makes it harder to process the transactions, and thus we may see less full nodes. On the other hand, it is also possible that smaller blocks will increase the nodes because it's easier to run the full nodes, or that slight larger nodes will increase the user base thanks to cheaper fees, and thus we will have more full nodes. We don't exactly know where the sweet spot is. What we do know for sure, is that the sweet spot is moving higher with time as technology improves. So even if Today's sweet spot is 4MB, in 2 years it may be 4.4MB or more. Tech must outpace the growth of the blockchain growth that we have Today.
Second layer solutions are very important, because they amplify any potential future block size increases. For example by merchant estimates, LN already serves appr. 10% of the Bitcoin on-chain transactions. In a few years LN will probably serve 10x of Bitcoin on-chain transactions. The same applies to other second layer solutions like Liquid. So, any small improvement on the base chain, will result in an amplification of \~10x or more, which increases the effectiveness of any block size increase and reduces the risks significantly.
Without LN, increasing the current 4MB (with Segwit) block size to 8MB would be very risky and only result in 2x increase in transaction capacity. But, if LN is already mainstream, the same block size increase would result in 20x capacity increase overall, so the upside is much bigger. Or to put it another way, going from 4MB to 4.4MB will double the capacity overall. 10% block size increase is 10x less risky and controversial than a 100% increase.
In 5 years 1 GB internet will be commonplace, and entry level $500 laptops will come with 5TB SSD and 5x faster CPUs. High end cell phones will be able to run Bitcoin full nodes on 5G networks. When that happens, we will be able to increase the block size slightly without risking the node count, and thus it will not be as controversial as it is Today.
Being conservative about block size increases is smart for Bitcoin, even if it means potentially somewhat slower network growth. Alts can experiment with other strategies, because they have less to lose, and more to win. In fact I would encourage experimentation, because Bitcoiners can learn from those experiments, and thus any potential change would be less risky.

This suggests that once Bitcoin is big enough to potentially be used by hundreds of millions worldwide, the congress will start thinking of trying to stop it. At 500 million users they will panic and pull out all the stops. 
But at that point it will be too late. The decentralized and international nature of Bitcoin means it would take an insane amount of influence to pull off a worldwide ban. It would not be successful at the end because some people will keep mining and running nodes no matter what.
Eventually the ban will fall apart, because it’s too hard to police proving the primary benefit of censorship resistance of Bitcoin and thus generating a renewed interest in Bitcoin. The price will shoot up yet again like crazy. And Bitcoin will become a safe haven for a long time.

If you need to open and close channels frequently for example between automated systems you would want a fast and cheap higher layer like liquid. Imagine an autonomous worldwide Uber like corporation. Every minute hundreds of drivers and riders join and leave the system worldwide. They all need to open channels to be able to stream money (for every km) for their trips, so they need to open channels for such frequent transactions.
We can't handle hundreds of transactions on Bitcoin base layer, but we can handle it on Liquid because it can scale easier as it has a different security model, which has a compromise that is acceptable for relatively small values (rather than all your savings being on Liquid).
Thus, you either get paid on Liquid or you peg some Bitcoin on Liquid. And then you can go around open channels with any service you need a payment streaming channel with, be it Uber, Netflix, ISPs, VPNs, electric company, etc. And others can stream pay you as well, for the electricity you produce with your solar panels at home while you are at work, for your monetised YouTube videos people all around the clock, etc.

People are willing to read books on subjects. It’s not that we are inherently. It’s just there is a method to keep your reader’s attention:
In the first opening sentence you explain why they should read the essay and what it promises to give them. Could be provocative too. 
In the first paragraph you summarize the idea even if it’s not fully supported by logic yet. 
Then you expand it more providing all the support. 
Kind of building from bottom up. People even write it that way. They write the body first, then first para, then first sentence. 
This helpful for people to internalize new knowledge and absorb large chunks of text easily.

Your argument would work if there wasn’t such a thing as tragedy of the commons. They may collectively think what you suggest but it only takes a few to break the damn. At that point everyone will jump in because they will be scared to lose their wealth. 
The reason many are not buying is because they don’t need the money. If you already have millions you don’t care to even educate yourself about some new form of risky investment. Only the geeks will buy because they want to experience it. 
The big buying will start when fiat is collapsing or when a new generation of currently young people who are comfortable with crypto grow into rich adults.

I never knew USD was backed by silver for a period of time.
I think backing by precious metals is not really a backing, because the precious metals themselves are tokens that are appreciated way beyond their actual utility. Sure gold and silver have industrial and decorative uses, but if it was valued at purely at its utility gold would be worth ~1% of its current price and silver ~5%. It's only valued this high because it's used like Bitcoin, as a store of value.
Real backing would be something like a small sack of rice per dollar or a square meter of land, etc. Something that is valued at its utility purely and has no speculative or store of value like property. Nothing is purely utility only of course, but it can be closer to reality.
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:48:01
If all ASIC miners stopped all at once (because of some hypothetical scenario), no more blocks would be mined and transactions would just pile up until they blow through limits on full nodes.
Bitcoin would not die however. At this point we could hard fork Bitcoin and reset difficulty manually down so that CPU and GPU mining could be possible and thus we could start mining again and then increase the difficulty automatically over time as it always has been. 
If no CPU/GPU mining was possible we could hard fork Bitcoin to be secured by some other method. Fortunately lots of work has been done in this area and while none of it is as secure as POW it would allow Bitcoin to survive.

What would that achieve? The spam won't hurt the BCH chain at all. The spam would be mined and be done with. In order to have any effect you would have to spam the 8MB blocks for days, and when the spam stops the fees would drop back to normal. This is not an attack vector.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:25:07
To be realistic, the current blocksize at 1MB even with LN fully adopted can only serve up to 15M people if everyone transacts once a month only to increase or settle their channel. The blocksize will have to grow at one point to serve billions of people.
Still LN will support at least a 10-100x increase without compromising security and decentralization, which is why it's a great move.
With the new layer discussed that goes between main chain and LN, we could add another two orders of magnitudes of scaling.

@_date: 2019-07-08 04:38:05
That is correct. In case you plug in your miner to the wall you are probably not green mining. But according to research the majority of mining is done in giant warehouses that are built in the vicinity of hydro or other plants that do sell excess energy. Thus, if you were to calculate the 'harmful' mining you should only be calculating with a fraction of what is being considered now. Suddenly the numbers would be quite small and not headline worthy. "Bitcoin wastes the energy equivalent to the city of Kraków, Poland." Oh yeah? Who cares?

If somebody has enough capital to influence the market and push the prices down they will be able to sell futures that they don't have to make up on.
In practice, let's say you sell a future for $500 for the option to buy BTC same time this year for $16K (even if the price is at $25K). A bunch of people give you $500 for this future promise. Now, if you have tons of money from these futures, you can buy up BTC slowly, then before the end of the year try to sell it all to push the price down below $16K, so nobody will want to exercise their futures. Thus, you get the keep the $500 less the amount you spend manipulating the market.
Now, this only works if you get hundreds of thousands of futures contracts. And it's super risky because you may not succeed crashing the market. At this point, you not only lost the $500 trying to tank the market, you also have to make up on the futures contracts and give $25K bitcoins at $16K to your clients, or as typically done in practice you pay them $9K in cash.

I never understood the argument that bitcoin is not backed by anything. It is clearly backed by people who want to buy it for one reason or another. Same like any other asset. Gold is also backed by people who are willing to buy it off you for whatever reason. The reasons are irrelevant. 
I also never understood the argument that bitcoin has no utility. Of course it does. If nothing else it allows you to transfer value. That on its own a value right off the bat. It has the same utility as PayPal or WesternUnion. Trucks, planes, ships all ‘just’ carry stuff from a to b. Do they also have no utility?

@_date: 2017-12-22 13:54:34
Agreed. We have to push segwit adoption, but it’s optional and will take time to have an effect. And even if it does, it’s not going to be enough. 
We need a conservative blocksize increase emergency hard fork now. 50kb / difficulty adjustment, if the blocks are 95% full. Maxed out at 16MB that would take 12 years to reach if blocks are constantly full which they won’t be.
This would immediately relieve the mempool for now. And will help LN work reliably and safely.
If it’s hard to get a transaction into the next block, LN won’t work well because you can’t broadcast a punish transaction if you partner wants to defraud you by broadcasting an older state of the channel. So the basic security model of LN relies on the idea that you can get into the next block with a high probability, thus the blocks should only be 95% or less full.

Far less than 5%. There are less than 20M accounts with BTC on it, and most people have many accounts. Many have Coinbase or other custodial accounts to hold BTC. Maybe add another 20M. By any estimate there are less than 70M BTC holders, which would be 1% of the world population. But I think the real number is close to 10-15M total only. So it’s like 0.2% of the population.

This is such a bullshit manipulative video to push BCH with false facts. This is not how Lightning Networks works at all.
LN doesn't require hubs (gold reserve banks as you call them). Any two or more parties can open a channel between them and use the channel to make millions of transactions. Nobody is forced to do anything you describe.
Also, the fees are BS too. By moving the high frequency users from the main chain to LN, we free up the main chain for regular bitcoin users and thus fees will drop, not increase.
Finally, LN will introduce a new concept into Bitcoin. You as a regular user will be able to operate a Lightning Node and lock up your bitcoins to provide liquidity for others to go through your node, and collect tiny fees in return. All the BTC holders will be able to put their coins to use to generate revenue from it. This will drive the demand for BTC higher and reward holders by sharing the fees with miners. Effectively Bitcoin will become partially a POS coin, without compromising security whatsoever.

This is unexpected and cool. So basically this is where we stand:
* Use Bitcoin base layer for large value and long term 'store of value' transactions, and to create second layer channels (LN) or pegs (Liquid). Transactions are relatively slow and expensive, but very safe. Actually now slow at all ([ but not instantaneous. Typical use cases: Individuals saving in Bitcoin, and opening LN channels for small payments. Or, corporations pegging bitcoins for Liquid.
* Use Bitcoin LN transactions for small value instantaneous payments and for payment streaming (in the near future) if you are comfortable keeping channels open for longer time and make lots of LN transactions on them. Also, in the near future trade tokens of all kinds to prove ownership or participation, etc. Typical use case: Individuals receiving payments for small freelance jobs, and paying for their expenses, phone top-ups or coffee. Individual buying the ownership of digital goods.
* Use Liquid for frequent high value transactions if you need them done fast and cheap, and you don't mind being exposed to the potential small risk of the Liquid federation. Typical use case: transactions between exchanges, or companies doing import-export payments.
* User Liquid LN transactions for small value instantaneous and confidential payments and for payment streaming if you need to open and close lots of channels frequently fast and cheap, and you don't mind the federation. Also, in the future tokens for ownership, etc. Typical use cases: Automated corporations transacting a lot with various parties for short amounts of time. Paying for data streams, or rendering, etc. Accumulating tokens that proves work done.

Typically what would happen is when you buy Bitcoin on an exchange they would offer you to send it through opening a channel to you. Thus, you would be able to instantly use within your LN wallet to buy stuff or send it back to the exchange to sell for dollars. If you spend some of it, the channel will be able to receive coins from others too. You would only have to settle if you wanted to close the channel for any reason. So, there would be one transaction opening the channel by the exchange which they may or may not pay for, and another when you close it. But all the transactions spending and receiving bitcoins would be off-chain and instant.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:13:30
Yes, work is being done to improve the situation as we speak. You will hear announcements soon.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:58:00
Nope. It’s equally useful just different. Now, you can make very high value transactions with it without moving the market because of high price and liquidity. Liquidity is important because most transactions include some form or buying in or cashing out. Very few purchases are made in crypto and stay in crypto fully. Typically there is a good deal on something as long as you pay in BTC, so the buyer has to buy BTC on an exchange first. Or the seller needs dollars to cover expenses, etc.

How is it unusable? BTC processes 10x the number of transactions compared to BCH every day. Yes, it's only good for high value transactions, it's not good for micro-transactions right now, but that's an important use case too. High value transactions need the most secure network, which Bitcoin is.
If speed and fees are the killer feature for cryptos what makes BCH the winner? ETH, and LTC are faster and equally cheap. They process several times more transactions than BCH. At this point BCH is the slowest cash coin of all the major alts.

If you were to deposit US$ to bitstamp, buy BTC and then send to GDAX and sell, then transfer it to your bank account you could make a few percent gain, but you would have to spend money on sending the dollars to and from the exchanges. It would probably not make much money for you at the end, unless you do it with a million dollars worth.
People will do this regardless and thus the price difference will slowly disappear.

I think Bitcoin and Litecoin devs have the right idea how to create a second and third layer on top of main chains to create a global instant payment system. Ethereum has a significant chance to be super important too. The other coins don’t have enough network effects or enough differentiation to make it big. But they will still be important in their own niche. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:28:00
Still, it's not broken if it serves 360K transactions for people every single day. It provides a bunch of value by moving high values peer to peer. It's a payment network for high value items, like iPads, computers, cars, houses, companies, etc. Not coffee, or pay to view microtransactions. For microtransactions you need to get a Bitcoin visa card, move $1,000 on it and spend off-chain. It's unnecessary to store such transactions on-chain on all 100,000 Bitcoin nodes.
True, BTC doesn't move $1 transactions efficiently on-chain anymore, and that's annoying, but it will be solved on second layer like Roostock and LN eventually.
What perverse incentives are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:50:04
It's all psychological. When the price is 1 for a month and now it's 2, you feel like it's expensive. But 2 will feel normal after a few weeks, because people get used to it, so they feel comfortable buying again.

It seems like a lot, but it's not that bad. We have like 120,000 waiting to be confirmed, but that's only like 8 hours of blocks. Bitcoin confirms 360K transactions every day. We only need segwit to be implemented by a few major wallets, like Core wallet, and / or implemented by a major company like Coinbase to increase segwit adoption by 10% in order to increase the network capacity by 4%. This increase would clear out the mempool within 7 days. At that point Bitcoin would be confirming 375K transactions a day. And this increase can go on until Bitcoin is confirming half a million transactions regularly. After that we would need another scaling method to take effect.
Lightning Network may help, because I expect some high frequency users would move their transactions to it, but it won't have a serious effect for at least 6 months or more. Rootstock bitcoin RSK coins will probably move most low value transactions off chain, which is a help too.
Eventually we need a small blocksize increase. My idea is 5%(or 0.05MB)+ per difficulty adjustment if the blocks are 90% full. And -5% if the blocks are only 70% full. This way the maximum increase per year would be 26*5=130%, or 2.3MB base blocks, without the segwit part. Thus, at worst case the blockchain would increase by 130GB per year instead of the current 50GB per year. That will probably result in some old nodes drop off, but we would have 2-3x more users, so the total number of full nodes will probably increase. In case of ETH the growth of the blockchain didn't result in drop of nodes, because they also grew the number of users, thus it was a net positive.

Yes. I believe eventually that will be the case. Coinbase will pay your channel fee and you will never have to settle. You can spend the bitcoins you bought through LN and then you can receive as much as you spent on the same channel.
However people will likely have many channels open at once. Not just one.
Hard to tell where the tech takes us. It is possible it is not LN that makes BTC spendable for micro-transactions but Rootstock. LN may be a tool for specialized applications where millions of transactions need to be created in a short amount of time. Like streaming payments. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:02:19
Well, it would probably not be called Segwit2x as it would be confusing, but something like Bitcoin Variable Blocksize Upgrade, or VBU, but that's besides the point.
If the fork is successful, the great majority of the hashrate would be on the new fork, and if anyone still mines the old fork it would stay alive too. The old chain would likely completely die, or become so small in every way, it becomes irrelevant.
For example, when BCH forked to implement the new difficulty adjustment, the old BCH fork remained alive and it is still working under the name Bitcoin Clashic. There is no replay protection between BCH and Clashic, but it's not causing issues as far as I know. Nobody cares about it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:36:26

@_date: 2017-12-15 22:37:35
If not in 2 weeks, but having a clear and public plan on when and how blocksize will be increased would be very important. Otherwise all small payment use cases will move to other chains.
Segwit will help, but it will take months until it is rolled out. Not even the Core wallet has UI for it. 
LN is great, but it will take a year or more until it becomes useful after it is launched on mainnet because we will need people and businesses migrate to LN wallets. 
On the short term the blocksize increase hard fork is the only solution I can see. In my opinion it should not be a one time jump but a gradual inceease based on how full the blocks in a certain period are. Perhaps 5% increase of block size on every difficulty increase if 90% of blocks were full in the last period. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:50:20
The forks don't threaten Bitcoin at all, just like all the alts didn't hurt Bitcoin either in the last few years. All these experiments are helpful.
It's a different algo, so it doesn't compete with Bitcoin.
The more forks the better. We need lots of teams testing various things in real market conditions. Bitcoin holders can benefit from these forks by selling the coins, and the devs can learn from the experiments and build in the knowledge to Bitcoin to make it better.
I think there are like 10-12 Bitcoin forks in total so far. Cash, Gold, and Diamond, and United Bitcoin already happened. I think 2018 will be the year of the forks.

No. Mining difficulty won’t change at all. The miners get the same reward for a fixed block size or variable blocksize block. 
Markets will react probably positively if the fork is well planned and supported by miners and exchanges. However since it will be known well in advance it won’t create a sudden price increase rather a gradual one from the time the plan is announced.

Yeah. It’s expected. Bitmain is an investor in Bitpay and BCH is Bitmain’s project. 
They will also support more coins, likely LTC and ETH. 
With $20 bitcoin fees this was inevitable. Bitcoin needs to raise the blocksize a bit to relieve the fee pressure now, to keep the currency use case. Otherwise it will become only viable for large value transactions. $500 and above. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:07:52

Also, two on-chain transactions are segwit transactions, so they are as big as one regular transaction only. And the channel can be open for months on end. As a user you don't care if your bitcoins are on-chain or on-lightning. All you feel is that being on-chain gives you instant transactions and extremely low to no fees. It still shows as bitcoin in your wallet.

If the fee situation is resolved it will go way higher. But for that at least two of these have to happen:
1.) segwit gets 50%+ adoption rate
2.) LN proves to be successful and relieves the main chain of transactions
3.) core executes the planned 2/4/8 mb block size increase

I think the world is not black or white. It’s not 1MB decentralized or 1GB centralized.
The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. Increasing the blocksize slightly over long periods of time is acceptable for decentralization and would resuce the fees and allow more people to use Bitcoin thus increase its value due to increased network effects. 
It is great to have alts testing the waters and verifying in real world scenarios if our assumptions are correct or not.
I opposition to block size increase it was said a bigger blockchain will reduce the number of nodes and user growth won’t compensate for it. This has been proven false by Ethereum. Their blockchain is now twice as big than BTC and the number of nodes is increasing because they also have more users. They have over 25K full nodes visible on the network as opposed to 10K on bitcoin. Thus, we now know that increasing the userbase will compensate for some old nodes dropping off, because some new users will run full nodes to make up for it and more. 
It was also said that larger blocks won’t propagate, create more orphans, etc. BCH tested this for us and we know there are no such issues anymore, because the internet is generally better and faster. 
Are there any technical issues with larger blocks? I’m not aware of any others that haven’t been resolved so far.
I understand and agree that it’s not a long term solution to raise the block size, but it’s a necessary short term solution and it’s part of the long term solution too.
Core’s scaling plan from two years ago clearly states that at one point the blocksize needs to be raised to make sure user experience and network growth is not limited by this factor. It’s been signed by all who matters. I listen to them and respect their opinion. 
I think the time is now. We need a solution to increase the block size gradually and conservatively in a way that only requires one hard fork to solve it for a long time. I think the miners will give us support. Heck they were 95% behind s2X. It would be crazy not to support an official core blocksize hf that is properly designed and tested. 
I suggest 50kb block size increase on every difficulty adjustment if the blocks are 95% full in the last period. And 50kb decrease if it’s below 85%. This way the most we would get is around 20 (not every two weeks) x 50kb increase or 1MB per year. We would have the segwit part grow similarly to match up the base block. 
This would mean if the block size was increased by the max amount and all blocks were full after 12 months we would have a base blockchain growth of 100GB instead of 50GB. Not too bad. I know my node can easily handle it, including the increased traffic.
The max would be capped at 16MB which we would only reach in 10+ years. 
This would keep the fees at around $1 for the next few years until we have LN ready and adopted to a wide level. At the same time the benefit to move to LN would still be very strong, since the fees on LN would be just a few Satoshis compared to few hundred on the main chain. 
Once we use LN extensively we still need a larger blocksize anyway. At the current block size we can only serve 15M people if they only touch the majn chain once a month, which is reasonable because occasionally you need to rebalance your channels no matter how well developed LN is. Even with additional layers we only get to maybe 100M users at 100% segwit and LN adoption. That’s not enough to serve the world. We need to raise the blocksize to serve LN so it can reach a critical mass where it’s really useful because virtually anyone can pay anyone else.
So for now we would use the larger blocksize to serve users on chain, and later to serve them on LN. 
I hope Core devs can suggest a good dynamic blocksize idea and we can start testing it on testnet soon. Let’s do this folks!

@_date: 2017-12-17 13:06:22
Yes and no. LN is great, but initially will only be used by specializes situations by people who make tons of transactions on chain normally. This is great because it will relieve the main chain. But average folks won’t be opening LN wallets and signing up for monitoring services to make sure the channels are safe any time soon. It will take a year or more for LN to become mainstream. 1 year is a very long time in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:40:05
That’s correct. Multiple cryptos are going to be used as a single system.

Yes. You can but the earnings will be very low. You would be better off mining an altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:46:03
Yes. Billions of users would need billions of transactions. Currently the bitcoin blockchain can support up to ~400,000 transactions per day, so at one point the block size would have to be increased so we can support billions of users, not just millions. 
Yes. Most people will get a channel with their bitcoins on it the first time they buy BTC on an exchange. They would be able to send the coins back to the exchange instantly with no fee or se s it to anyone else connected to the exchange directly or indirectly for a tiny fee.
If the other party in a channel wants to defraud you by broadcasting an old state of the channel, you can indeed punish them by taking all the coins in the channel. If we are talking about amounts that are lower than an on-chain transaction, you may decide not to punish. However if the loss if bigger than the requires on-chain fee it would be in your interest to punish. Since most people will monitor the channels and many will punish no matter what, chances are very few if any will try a fraudulent broadcast at any amount.
LN would be for small transactions typically. Larger transactions would be done on-chain anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:54:08
Because the attack costs money, so while it's possible to do, it's not economical to do so. But things could change if the hashrate drops to 1-3% making the attack that much cheaper, or if there is money to be made disrupting the network, perhaps by shorting it, etc.
Also, it's possible none of the miners are evil enough to do it right now. But in the future new miners could come on-board that ARE. This is why a healthy 20% would be necessary to keep BCH chain safe. That would require the price to be on a $4K for months, while BTC stays around $20K.
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:28:02
It’s hard to know if active wallets are actually correlated with adoption. For example, if I lock up funds in a LN channel for a year it will look like I’m inactive but I may be making thousands of sends and receives. Also, it’s easy to fake activity. You can create 10K addresses and move a few hundred dollars around on them until fees eat up all the funds. Then start over.

You argue a straw man. I specifically said that I don't appeal to authority. I pointed it out because you did you use that argument earlier ("I live next to hydro... I toured it... have you?"). So it's kinda ironic, that you're throwing this back at me as a supposed fallacy. Is your logic broken today? ;)
In any rate. You're making the assumption that if excess energy is used it somehow encourages increased energy use that is not excess. Maybe so, but that's speculation. Your parallel with cars is completely broken, because more cars haven't been driven on excess energy. Again, what's with your logic?
Look, we're in the same boat. We're both environmentalists. We both care about Bitcoin's energy consumption. But claiming untrue sensationalist things, and admittedly being hyperbolic doesn't help the case. It creates an environment where your arguments will be dismissed entirely. Stating facts as close to reality as possible, analysing them holistically and globally throughout the whole supply chain including alternatives and effects is what makes sense and helps our cause.
What I'm saying is that you should be realistic that only a fraction of Bitcoin's mining is not-green, and even if it was 100% dirty, you should consider the good it brings to society. Maybe on the whole it's worth it. Maybe the fact that it encourages building solar and hydro offsets the negative effects by far. Maybe the big reliable demand of energy pushes us finally to the atomic age, which is arguably the greenest and safest energy source and would solve global climate change within a decade. Maybe the fact that Bitcoin helps avoid a total collapse of world economy when the whole world goes to hell and pollution will skyrocket due to lack of regulatory oversight is worth considering. Don't get bogged down by hammering a single parameter that fits your narrow narrative. Think more broadly with me.

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:29:09
There is. Core developers stated that in case the blocksize is a hinderence to user experience and the growth of the network we need to do a hard fork to alleviate the pain. We're currently that that point where we can't serve more users and the fees are out of this world ($100+). You can't move any amount below $10,000 in value efficiently at this point, or your fees will eat up a significant amount of your bitcoins.
Anything around or below $1 is reasonable and acceptable, but $10+ is too high.
If we need to support the miners after 2 years with fees because the mining reward is too low, fine. But let's do it by increasing the capacity 20x so the fees of $1 add up to a good chunk of money that way.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:41:36
Probably not, if anything replaces it ETH and LTC will do it before BCH. They are faster and already more widely used processing many times more transactions than BCH.

Well. Not exactly. With Segwit adoption the daily transactions on chain are closer to 700K. 
For LN onboarding you would buy let’s say one btc from an exchange. They would open a channel for you to send your BTC to your LN wallet. You can start spending and receiving on this safe channel and you may not have to settle potentially for years.
Also, Core plans include a 2/4/8MB blocksize scaling after LN launched to support LN. This will allow together scale to hundreds of millions of people.
Finally a layer between LN and the main chain will allow funding channels without touching the chain. This will finally allow us to serve the world.

No. Channel transactions are real bitcoins transacted. They use signatures and all. And the funds are already committed on chain in advance so it’s equally safe as an on chain confirmed transaction. You don’t need to settle ever. 
However, LN needs to be used widely to be as useful as BTC on-chain. For example bitpay and exchanges must support it, so when you buy btc on coinbase they would have the option to send it to you on an LN channel by creating an-chain transaction and then you can spend those btc on LN on bitpay without an on-chain transaction. And you will be able to receive as much btc as you spent on LN wihout on-chain transactions.

1. Traders would open a channel between themselves and the exchange, so they don't have to wait for confirmations and they can be sure to own their bitcoins and keep them off exchange whenever they are not trading them. This would remove the bunch of back and force transactions between private wallets and exchange wallets.
2. Many other transactions are between two parties who are connected through at least one common service they use. For example most US users would be connected through a Coinbase, Bitpay, or Gemini ln node. So if they have a channel open to any of these, they will be able to send to all the millions of users who are also connected. Beyond that Coinbase will likely be connected to non-US nodes too, like Bitstamp or QuadrigaCX's node, so they will be able to hop through those to reach virtually anyone in the world.
The idea is that the exchange will open a channel for you when you buy bitcoins the first time, and then on you will be able to spend those bitcoins with anyone connected to that exchange directly or indirectly. And as you spend your bitcoins your channel will be able to accept payments too, so you will be able to receive from anyone.
Benefits are clear. No on chain transactions beyond the initial one, and then on everything is instantly confirmed, and you pay 1-2 SAT per hop only, while you're on the safest and biggest network of all.

He was joking. He was suggesting it's an attack vector.
@_date: 2018-09-20 01:28:51
That’s true but it introduces risk because when you settle back to on-chain it rounds it up. So if a Satoshi is worth $100 you don’t want to be rounded down by $49. :)

It’s best you avoid the drama. It’s just a distraction.

Interesting... it sounds reasonable. :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:01:30
Put half in now, so you're in the game for the long term even if the price never dips. Keep the other half in case there is a dip to get a better price average. Ultimate strategy to minimize pain.

There are cryptos without the blockchain. Ex. Byteball. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:59:43
Yeah, but a transaction is not one byte! Median bitcoin transaction size is 226 bytes. So 0.0682 x 226 = $15.4132
Also, the LTC fee should be around $0.15 - $0.2. See here: 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:45:41
Can be an SPV wallet. It just needs to monitor the channel address and broadcast a punishing transaction. I think it can be a phone app. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:53:18
As fees rise, less people will broadcast transactions, and will wait with less urgent transactions to be sent later, when the fees go down a bit.
Yes, adoption outpaced scaling efforts at this moment. But it's OK, we need to be safe and slow, even if it causes issues for a few months. And, it's ok if alts rise, let them take low value transactions for now. Let them grow and test various policies and ideas. It's all good for Bitcoin and the whole ecosystem at the end.
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:00:35
Thanks. Your wording is correct. It’s crypto assets, not he blockchain. It’s like saying investing in TCP/IP instead of saying online businesses. The reason using blockchain is a bad idea for crypto assets is because it’s just one of the technologies behind Bitcoin. It doesn’t really apply to all cryptos. For example byteball doesn’t have a blockchain. It uses a different way to store transactions. It’s not the only one and any of the big cryptos could change to a newer tech at any time. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:34
Not a pain at all. Happy to help.
If you have your own wallet, like a Trezor, you hold the private keys. More specifically you hold the mnemonic words that create private keys to store your coins. You can recover your wallet with this mnemonic in any wallet and nobody can take your coins away. You can use these private keys to recover any coin forks.
If you're on an exchange you don't have a mnemonic or private keys. You just have login information and you have an entry in the exchange's database that BTC-North_Wales holds this many coins. But technically the exchange holds the private keys, and their coins are theirs. You're just promised by the exchange to be able to withdraw to your own wallet when you want. A promise they may break at any point. The exchange may or may not give you your forked coins. It's up to them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:07:19
Seems like it confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:00:13
Yes, you're right. I'm talking about percentage of total available hashpower.

We were going crazy about such 'adoption' a few years ago. Now, it's like normalcy. Bitcoin is growing up. :)

Learn about how to manage your own coins irrespective of your current ownership. It’s a skill that’s important for any individual living in a post 2020 world. A date that will mark the start of hyperbitcoinisation. 
It’s kind of like learning how to use email in 1990.
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:39:16
The supervision of conversion between BTC and SBTC (RSK) is done by a federation of exchanges, so theoretically they could control this channel.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:57:22
Go in with half now. Wait with the rest for a possible dip. If there is no dip you are still in the game with half the money.
However if you plan to keep long term, it doesn’t matter much when you jump in, do it as soon as you can. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:46:10
The bitcoin mining difficulty resets every ~2 weeks to make sure we keep mining appr. 6 blocks an hour, thus making sure the inflation rate is stable.
It typically increases every time as more hashing power comes on board. It adjusted ~18% last time and ~17% this time (Today).
The hope is that with the larger difficulty Bitcoin Cash (BCH) which was starved of hashing power has a chance to increase their hash rate and be more safe. Yesterday it was below 4% which makes it trivially easy to 51% attack it, so people were losing confidence in BCH to be able to provide a secure chain.
BTC network was producing like 7-8 blocks an hour in the last 2 weeks, and the mempool of transactions was still increasing. Now, with 6 or even less, the mempool likely will grow faster, and thus BCH's rhetoric of BTC being 'broken' seems validated in their eyes. Thus the value of BCH has been increasing.
However, as fees on BTC rise, the miners will come back to BTC because they want to mine the fees. Thus, ironically high fees keep BTC secure.
Having said, that BTC needs a hard fork to increase the block size gradually, so the network can serve the increasing number of users.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:33:25
Right now the fees are around 17 satoshis / byte, so your fee is too high! :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:17:50
Hah, well, yes. :) The idea is to find the optimal path that hurts least. It hurts if the blockchain is big, it hurts if the blocks are small. What is the optimal blocksize? Nobody knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:41:40
If you want to suggest diversification, you should mention more advanced coins than BCH which offer nothing compared to LTC. Diversify into ETH, Dash, IOTA and more exotic coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:35:33
Yes, it's free. You can set it up and you won't be compensated for it. But you help the network.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:51:41
Something is off. $0.0682 for BTC fee? More like $5-10, not?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:37:31
You can wait and hope that fees drop to confirm the transaction, but it's unlikely to happen.
You can try to double spend it with a higher fee.
Finally, you can wait until it drops out of the mempool and then it returns to you.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:19:12
What a scumbag move Roger! :(
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:58:55
Are you saying there is no fee problem? There is. People regularly complain that their $10 fee transactions with one input aren’t going through for days. And anything lower is stuck forever.
Yes, it’s an asset but even as an asset it can only serve a few million people no matter how much fees are you willing to pay. We need much more than that if we want BTC to be an even stronger store of value, and if we want the price to ever go 10x again. 
So, block size needs to be increased gradually and conservatively to relieve fee pressure and allow BTC to grow while other second layer solutions and segwit gain adoption (50%+), which will take years.
Core’s scaling plan includes 2/4/8mb block size increase eventually. Why not start with something more conservative but right away. Like a 3% increase per month if the blocks are full. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:09:06
Apparently it never happened. It was a minor incident with no real economic impact.

We know he didn't cash out because the coins didn't move, unless he sold private keys to someone who trusts him, which would be weird but theoretically possible.

So basically the selloff is now done ✅. I wonder what will happen when Bitcoin fans get millions of dollars from this case. I bet it will push the price up quite a bit. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 05:40:01
No, you didn't. I said hashrate **share** grew, which it did. Share can go anywhere from 0% to 100%, and when it increases that's growth, when it decreases it's a drop. Relative hashrate is nicer term for hashrate share, but they are both correctly describing the metric.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:11:28
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:21:26
Yes, theoretically any of the ideas can be implemented on BTC. In practice there needs to be wide consensus about what to change. But that's a good thing. That's why BTC can be stable as a currency. If any party could just change the code, BTC would have no value.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:51:58
From their web ub.com
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:36:39
Yes. The question is what are the odds of being able to buy back significantly lower to take the risk.  Also, is it worth selling and paying taxes on the sale, just to make some profit which is lower than your taxes due.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:03:50
I think keeping POW for the base layer, and have effective POS on layer 2 and 3 (LN) is the best of both worlds. Once we run a million times more transactions on LN, than on the base layer, the per transaction electricity cost will be negligible.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:25:10
The routing part is a separate layer though, right? Different algos can be added by various wallets that compete for users without the need for consensus. The current version of routing is the most basic to demonstrate the concept. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:07:07
Bitcoin is not good for small values right now because of high fees. Adoption of Bitoin is too fast and segwit adoption didn't keep up with it. Once coinbase, bitpay, bitfinex and some other businesses introduce Segwit in 2018, the fees will go back down again.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:11:45
I don’t think this is a good idea... they are already struggling with requests. Ironically segwit support would reduce the issues their customers are having. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:32:19
It would just show up in the right wallet. Same keys. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:41:02
No. LTC has more transaction capacity so opening and closing channels will be cheaper and faster. So heavy LN users will use LTC to settle more often. Even though I agree that BTC will be the most widely used coin on LN, there will be a place for not only BTC, LTC and ETH on this second layer, but a few other coins too that have segwit or similar second layer support and offer something that the mentioned 3 can’t. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:26:34
That's true. Not practical for anything below $500.
The only practical way to use BTC is get a Bitcoin VISA debit card, load it with $1,000 and then spend it in small chunks off chain. It's best because most coffee shops don't accept any crypto anyway, and even if they did it's not practical to wait for the first confirmation.
For online crypto payments, you can use ETH, LTC which is the most accepted outside of BTC. Convert a few mBTC to ETH or LTC and then spend it.

@_date: 2017-12-18 14:38:04
It's not about being more difficult to mine larger blocks. It's about more difficult to store, process and transmit for full nodes. The worry is that if we have bigger blocks we will have less full nodes.
However, I agree with you that we can afford to go higher with blocks gradually, at 5% increments at every difficulty change if the blocks were 90% full in the last epoch. This would be conservative, so nodes won't be affected much, yet it will make a huge difference for transaction capacity and fees.

Here is the official Core Roadmap for scaling bitcoin:


Are we approaching the point where the risks of not going forward with the 2/4/8 suggestion is less of a risk than not doing it?
I just feel sorry for BCH holders. On announcing the the 2/4/8 plan the price would go to the gutters, because that's its main and pretty much only differentiating factor at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:55:23
Yeah, but it goes both ways. It won't be 20x bigger if the fees are $300 for the smallest transaction and in the thousand for a 4-5 input transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:24:16
Tell your bank you are going to terminate your account with them because of this policy andngo to another one that accepts btc.
@_date: 2018-09-26 01:48:15
In a hyper inflation event all prices start to go up aggressively including your rent and the price of btc and your fee (salary) as well. So if you had savings in USD the value of it starts to disappear quickly, but BTC savings are staying solid. At one point the value of USD starts dropping so fast that it can’t be used as currency anymore. You get your salary in the morning and by the afternoon you can only buy a few apples for it. Next morning you get a matchbox. The day after nothing. In this world, people will start using anything to replace USD. The most obvious will be other currencies that are readily available. Since there won’t be billions of Euro bills available everywhere in the US, but Bitcoin is available at any amounts, it’s likely that people will start using Bitcoin to trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:40
You can get this card or many similar ones and pay anywhere: 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:24:56
You can have a background process running on your phone or desktop to monitor. And the risk of cheating is high. The person attempting the fraud would lose all the coins in the channel automatically as punishment.
So for example if you have a channel and only transact one way (you buy stuff with it) you are safe even if you are not online, because the other party can’t gain anything from settling an earlier state. But if the channel also receives coins the attack vector is there if nobody monitors it. If the other party attempts to broadcast the channel state before he sent you the bitcoins, he would lose all his coins in the channel and it would all come back to you to punish him. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:12:14
Hah! The transaction fee doesn't depend on the value you send. You can be sending one satoshi and you would still have to be spending $15 to get it confirmed in the next block. Bitcoin is absolutely not feasible for any transactions that are below $500.
This could be easily fixed by raising the block size so bitcoin could process more transactions and people won't need to compete with fees to get into the next block.
This is why we're so eager to have the following done:
1. Segwit adoption. If Coinbase and another large player, like Bitfinex introduced Segwit addresses, the fees would fall significantly, because the Bitcoin network could process more transactions per block. Almost double.
2. Lightning network, which is in final stages. It would allow frequent users open channels to send small transactions frequently and remove their transactions from on-chain, and thus reducing fee pressure.
3. Rootstock bitcoin RSK tokens, which will be pegged to Bitcoin and can be used to send low value transactions off bitcoin-chain as fast as Ethereum works, and very cheaply.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:42:10
You can send from a hardware wallet to an exchange directly. Hardware wallet is like a regular wallet, only you approve the transactions on the hardware dongle piece.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:43:21
Yes. But at 8MB BCH will run into issues when they are processing 8x transactions. That’s a pretty serious potential competition to BTC right there. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:54:02
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:01:30
Of course! :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:50:21
Nothing is keeping bitcoin back. A fork to increase the blocksize is possible at any time theoretically. However, it makes sense to do it in a way that balances the risks and the benefit well and is a long term solution so you don’t have to keep forking. 
The risks are that because there is a huge demand for the BTC blockchain as the biggest, oldest and most secure chain, any blocksize increase will almost immediately will be full of transactions, which means the blockchain will grow faster, which means it’s increasingly harder to download and keep the blockchain in sync for full nodes, which is a key component of the decentralization, a key property of bitcoin.
The benefit is of course more transactions, including transactions for smaller amounts to become feasible again.
The Core scaling plan includes a variable blocksize idea that will allow the blocksize to grow with demand in a controlled way, potentially indefinitely. 
However before that would be introduced that are other optimizations that can be made that increase the transaction capacity and do not increase the blocksize.
Like Shnorr singatures that will provide 25% transactions for the same blocksize and also give the network more confidentiality.
Or the lightning network which allows people to open channels with one transaction and potentially make millions of transactions off chain. For example a trader will open a channel to an exchange and send funds back and force any number of time making sure his funds are safe from an exchange hack, yet able to trade instantly if he wants to. No need to make on-chain transactions and wait for confirmations. 
But yeah, at one point the blocksize will need to increased. Everybody understands this. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:40:01
That’s true. A better experiment would be to try to do the same going forward for a year and see which one is better. 
BTC provides a value beyond speculation on a token. It helps people diversify into an asset that is independent and protected from potentially corrupt government currencies, and helps sending large amounts of value over the internet without risk or permission from anyone. 
The color Red is a token doesn’t provide any value beyond speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:15:38
It's not the holy grail indeed. For a while LN will only serve certain groups of users who transact frequently, and want to save on fees. Like traders. But moving all this activity off-chain will help on-chain transactions go through faster and cheaper.
There are multiple other solutions in the works, we will just have to see which one works best.

Got some info on how to find them please?

In fact it’s a stabilizing power in two ways. It’s a plan B, so it’s a fallback if things go wrong. And, it’s passively keeping the current powers in check not to do too many bad choices as they know people will switch to plan B otherwise as they have the choice now.

Bech32 is even smaller transactions than wrapped segwit transactions, so they allow more transactions per block and they are cheaper too.

You can also pay directly with BTC at overstock and get this feast!
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:58:06
You can run a full node to help the network. It's not very resource intensive. It's a legitimate concern, but there should be a fine balance between having lots of nodes, and having a working network which can absorb new users and still operate with reasonable fees. I think anything below $1 is reasonable. $10 and above is not reasonable in my opinion. But I understand different people think differently.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:33:05
We should and will scale the blocksize. The Core plan includes a 2/4/8MB increase.
However, in my opinion we should do it more gradually. Perhaps 15% a year. Or something like 1% increase when the blocks are full for a 2016 block period. Full defined as at least 1900 blocks (not the segwit part) are 100% full. This way we would maintain fee pressure, but release it a bit constantly as the number of transactions grow.
@_date: 2018-09-14 00:20:19
They will do so until somebody exploits this. If it’s possible to exploit it it’s not safe.

But also consider that xapo completed their dump. So there is no more BCH sell pressure coming from there anymore.
However we don’t know if Coinbase will introduce BCH as withdraw only or buy too. If buy as well, like LTC it may see a big pump. If withdraw only I think it will drop like a rock.

@_date: 2017-12-17 13:03:12
Yes. It’s all about use. Bitcoin has 10-20x or more transactions processed a day than other alts, except for ETH. Bitcoin has 10x value processed a day than all other alts, including ETH. Bitcoin has 10-20x more hashing power than Bitcoin Cash, thus equally more secure. Bitcoin has 10x more nodes than other alts, except for ETH, but ETH doesn’t have well developed SPV wallets that can provide the same functionality as the desktop wallets, so users are forced to run nodes, which is a good thing but likely temporary. Bitcoin has several times more active accounts than other alts. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:33:06
No. Eventually it will either confirm or come back to your wallet if it drops out of the mempool. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 02:38:51

According to the law I think it’s illegal without a license buy btc on exchanges on behalf of other people and give it to them. This is because it allows people to bypass know your customer laws. 
If he was just selling off his stash of btc investments it would not have been ilegal as far as I understand. If you bought a year ago and then sell now and be done with it, it would be legal.
But advertising 10btc you don’t have, collecting money and buying btc for the buyer on an exchange is another matter. 
I think this is consistent with other laws where selling personal property falls under a different law than operating a business.

@_date: 2017-12-16 00:17:22
I do support Bitcoin and a very gradual blocksize increase. I don’t support BCH’s hostility towards Bitcoin, but I support the experiment generally, because Bitcoin can learn from all the ~10 forks. 
For example we can find out if anyone will 51% attack BCH given its low hash rate. We can find out having script algo helps Gold. If smart contracts on UB will take off. Etc. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 02:22:53
This is bullish. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:55:07
Yes, that's correct. But this also means smaller shops won't be able to afford it. Like they can't afford credits cards Today. And larger stores will increase their prices to cover for the occasional thefts. Thus, indirectly the honest customers will cover the cost of thefts. This is of course not desirable, even if it just means a few percents of price increase. It adds up and you end up spending hundreds or thousands of dollars a year on covering for theft. If there is an alternative like LN, we should use that instead, better for everybody, but the thieves.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:19:38
Yes, but even with LN, we can only serve like 15M people or so if everyone only transacts once a month on the main chain. We need 10-100x of that. So increasing the blocksize is needed anyway, it's best to do it now, when it's really needed for the short term, and it will serve us long term too.

A hard fork was abandoned, and it was the good call. Had it gone through the blockchain would've stalled at the first mined block. There were at least 3 documented bugs in that code.
The reason why Core developers were opposed to that hard fork was because it was untested code created by literally one dev, who apparently didn't know what he was doing.
It wasn't opposed because of the goals of the fork. Core devs said there is nothing inherently wrong with a 2MB increase, it just needs to be done properly. The Core scaling roadmap includes a 2/4/8MB blocksize increase eventually.
I wish it was done as soon as safely possible.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:11:26
No, it's worth paying a $25 fee for an investment of $5,000+, so you know the chain won't be messed with.
If you have a chain with 1-5% hash power someone could repeatedly 51% attack it destroying confidence and eventually forcing miners to abandon it. The more hash power you have the less likely such an attack can be pulled off.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:00:24

Even if what you said was true, diversity of backgrounds and options is a value to the ecosystem. Even yours is interesting to read, even if your perspective is flawed in my view. 
I see it the other way around. Aside from Gavin, people like Roger are the ankle-biters. He made a bet on bcash and now he’a using every single possible unethical thing he can think of to hijack the Bitcoin brand, because he knows bcash without the brand name is completely worthless. Even dogecoin has more use and is faster too.

Don't try to mine or cloud mine. You will lose money. It's easier and more profitable to buy bitcoin and hold.
Once Lightning Network starts, people who own bitcoin will be able to run Lightning nodes and put their bitcoins in channels and route transactions for other people, and collect fees. You would effectively be mining for fees.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:41:52
Because nobody has the power to reverse a transaction. That's a key value in the system. If there was a way you revert transactions, you could have rogue governments stealing your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:41:09
Well, to be fair, we don't know for sure which scaling plan will be successful. They already have a big block in place, which could handle today's bitcoin traffic easily if it was a need on BCH. Bitcoin's LN or Rootstock is not on main net yet, and segwit adoption is slow. We need a few large companies to adopt segwit before it helps the Bitcoin network. All we have is promises so far. So, there is a small not-insignificant chance that BCH will gain significant marketshare in the alt world in the future. However, I think for the selling point of being 'cash' they have lots of competition with faster and cheaper solutions, for example LTC, Dash, etc. so it's a tall order.
@_date: 2018-09-11 05:23:41
Perhaps most of the bad actors left Bitcoin during the BCH fork. ;)

Correct. It’s not a POS coin. But you can put your BTC to work by opening channels between two popular smaller hubs and collect fees if people hop through your hub. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:26:35
It still is an effective medium of exchange for values over $500. Basically right now BTC is for buying computers, cars, houses, companies, because of high fees and because it has high liquidity. Alts are for coffee, small scale gambling, groceries, because of low fees and much lower liquidity.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:33:04
LN is basically the same as a bitcoin on-chain transaction pre-approved, so you don't have to wait for the confirmation when making the purchase, but when you open the channel. Then you can spend all the bitcoin you put into the channel, without making on-chain transactions every time. From the merchant's perspective this is a win, because they get the bitcoins faster and they can sell them for dollars off-chain faster too.
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:10:07

Segwit2x died because there was no community support as it seemed risky, as it wasn't tested properly.
The worries were validated when some miners tried to go through with the fork and found out that the code was buggy and stalled on the first block. At that point the fork died.
Now, scaling the blocksize is still in the plans, but it will be done with proper testing and probably in a way that provides a long term solution rather than a one off scaling. It should be a variable blocks size so it can grow and shrink with demand, balancing user needs and systemic risks.

It's totally different. This enables to use the native bitcoin scripts easier, but doesn't extend the functionality. Bitcoin's script is intentionally simple to avoid issues like Ethereum had.

In your scenario people may not take your fiat for milk. Because fiat is worthless. They will want your gold and bitcoin because those hold value in other countries.
People in the US will be more likely to switch to Bitcoin than to Yen or Euro because Bitcoin is already accepted and used in the US more than Yen and Euro. You can top up your phone with Bitcoin, you can buy gift cards for virtually any chain with Bitcoin, you can directly order stuff online with Bitcoin. Not so with Yen or Euro.
Now for other countries. The USD has more chance of taking over than Bitcoin, but Bitcoin could still win because it’s less regulated. The only way USD can exchange hands is cash which is quite limiting. You can’t wire USD to Venezuela right now for example, because the government takes it. But you can freely send BTC. 
Hope this explains why Bitcoin will come out on top in a hyperinflation scenario. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:18:34
Yes, you're correct.
I will try to explain in steps.
Imagine that you invest at $1 and your expected price target is $2. Let's say the chances of $2 happening is 50% according to your best judgement. This means you have 50% chance of $2 happening and 50% that it's not happening and goes to zero. So the way to calculate your possible gains are 0.5x$2 + 0.5x$0 = $1. (0.5 represent 50% chance). Thus, you invested $1 and your expected reward is $1 based on your chances.
If your judgement is that $2 is to happen with 60% chance, the calculation becomes: 0.6x$2 + 0.4x$0 = $1.2. This means you invest $1 and your expected reward is $1.2 when adjusted for chances. So, it makes sense to invest. However at 40% your expected reward is just $0.8, so it makes no sense to invest.
@_date: 2018-09-24 23:42:58

BTC is divisible to 8 decimal points (satoshis), so there is no problem. The value of your coins would simply go up in value.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:47:55
After a quick rise there is a consolidation period. After that if the market is bullish the price will go up again, if it's bearish it will go down. But with all the good news and projects happening around BTC, the market seems bullish now.
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:44:24
So $1M / BTC by 2024. Statistically speaking, if you believe there is only 0.64% chance of that happening, it’s still rational to buy at current prices. If you are targeting just $100K, you only need a belief of 6.4%. The higher the gain the less confidence you need. If you think the chances are any higher for those gains, it’s rational to buy. Whether you gains will be realized is currently unknown but you can be confident that you made a reasonable decision given your current information and ability to process available to you data. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:27:36
On short term you gamble and try sell high and buy low. On the long term just hold and see you Bitcoin appreciate. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:31:29
Technically it’s not just for Bitcoin though. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 23:48:16
The percentages are derived from the difference between current and expected price. The bigger the gain the less confidence you need to buy because the reward compensates for the risk. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:38:10
Why? Is it wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:47:03
First extract the private keys from your current account that have and had btc at the time of the fork. Verify the associated public keys on a BTC and BCH block explorer that the keys have coins on them. 
Now send all your BTC to brand new wallet. Your BTC is now safe on an independent address. 
Time to claim your BCH. Download a BCH supporting wallet like Copay. Swipe your old private keys with BCH on them. It’s treated like paper wallets by the wallet. Now you can send the BCH to an exchange. 
Don’t discard old wallet keys. You are also eligible for bitcoin gold now, and bitcoin diamond if it ever launches.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:41:01
You do have to backup your channels to make sure you have the latest state of the channels, and you can restore the channels. But I’m not 100% sure how this will be realized in practice. It will likely be easy.

Hope one day this won’t be a challenge. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:39:00
You actually have to sell your BTC before you can send fiat to your checking account. You can't send BTC to your checking account directly.

It’s much easier and cheaper to run a lightning node than running an Asic miner. So LN will be less centralized than mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:42:49
I meant if you open a channel with someone you can have a channel running for free. You only pay a fee if you want to be routed through somebody's LN node that charges a fee.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:04:05
If people can buy BCH besides just sell, the buyers and sellers may balance each other out and, generally it will be a positive sigh for BCH, so the price may go up.
If it's only sell, almost certainly BCH price will crash for a while.
I think it's quite risky for Coinbase to implement full support because BCH's hash rate is quite low. Any rogue pool could 51% attack it causing exchanges like Coinbase lots of trouble and loss of confidence. They are already overwhelmed with issues from customers, imagine if the BCH chain was regularly rolled back by some nefarious actor occasionally.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:57:48
Yes, I'm fine with them experimenting and trying things. It's great! But actively trying to destroy your competition is just cringe. It makes them look desperate and weak. Look at LTC being friendly with BTC and riding high with BTC. Taking on that strategy would have been great for BCH. They should position themselves as the Bitcoin for small value less safe (less mining power) transactions alongside the BTC for large value safer transactions. But it seems like LTC will take this spot and the two currencies will sort of fuse on the Lightning Network with atomic swapping serving the whole world. Rootstock with bitcoin RSK tokens will take the smart contract use case.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:21:38
Somebody should actually make it happen. :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:04:07

Are you sure it’s legit? Maybe it eats your BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:43:17
Well, you can outsource the monitoring to third party services.
Also, it's very risky to try and steal funds by broadcasting an earlier state of the channel. If you try to do that, by design the honest party will be able to receive all the funds in the channel including the attacker's funds. So, the incentive structure prevents people from trying, unless they can be 100% certain nobody is monitoring the channel.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:54:25
Well said. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:27:12
Once lightning goes online we have a real shoot at becoming bigger, but even with LN we cannot match VISA transaction levels. The benefit of bitcoin lies elsewhere. Its value comes from it being decentralized and permissonless. 
VISA and Bitcoin can work together. VISA can facilitate the payments and Bitcoin can protect your savings from inflation and rogue governments, etc. It’s already happening with the wirex and bitpay, etc cards. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 02:13:14
In those times nodes meant miners with full nodes. And client nodes meant full nodes or SPV nodes in current terms.
I think a healthy config is to have lots of miners in many pools. Lots of full nodes with economic activity that includes individuals not just corporations to reduce the possibility of collusion or government enforcing new rules. And finally even more SPV wallets and LN clients connected to nodes that are operated by people they can fully trust.
So for example. I would run a full bitcoin and LN node at home and then the whole family could be connecting to it on mobile devices, which could be a dozen or more light wallets. This way I don’t have trust a company to validate transactions for me, but we also don’t have to carry the blockchain on many phones and computers. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:47:52
If it is properly tested and all, I think miners will support it and it will go through smooth. It can't be just somebody, because I you may know the last attempt of s2x hard fork was buggy and stalled at first mined block. It needs to be done by a competent team of developers.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:56:55
That coin has been having miner issues from the beginning. Currently they have so little power, a 51% attack is really easy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:15
Ledger if they support it will provide a tool to split the coins. I don't know if any exchanges will support it. There are many other forks too... zcash clone bcash (not the BCH bcash) is interesting unless it's a joke. There is bitcoin diamond, super bitcoin, etc.
@_date: 2018-09-24 10:50:27
The question is what will lose value faster compared to the dollar. If dollar sinks faster than Bitcoin, it will feel like Bitcoin is growing and thus people will escape into it. The difference between USD and Bitcoin is that the dollar is very much dependent on the performance of a single large country, while Bitcoin is international so the risk is diversified.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:02:19
Technically that’s not why it exists. It exists so Bitmain can keep mining with ASIC boost. The 8MB is a secondary reason.

@_date: 2017-12-18 18:29:58
I agree. But having a plan in place, and start testing the block size increase hard fork now would be a good idea, so we have it ready and safe by the time it is sorely needed. If not needed because of second layer solutions, we won't need to implement it.

I can’t believe hashrate is still growing so aggressively. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:14:34
That’s good. It will signal to traders that it’s a good buying opportunity. And thus we reach bottom and start building up for the next rally. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:47:05
Even if you use the same receiving address it won't help with the fees. You still have multiple signatures when spending. What would help is creating a segwit wallet. That would cut your fees in half.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:03:21
Yes. But isn’t that the case anyway? You can’t send 1BTC if you don’t have 1BTC. Same with LN. You have to have 1BTC in your channels to send 1BTC. 
Or are you talking about routing? Yes, the more BTC you have the more useful your node for others is, so you can collect more fees. Thus, there is an incentive to buy BTC to earn fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:01:23
Yes. :/

It’s nice of him to say that, but I think it’s a shared responsibility. We all could’ve made the effort to test and review more, and find the bug.
Every code has bugs. Even SSL had a serious bug even though literally the whole world was using it for a decade. We can do our best to find bugs, but we can never with 100% certainty get rid of them. When a bug arises we should not panic, we should just keep working on lowering the probability of bugs.
If you want to help, learn Bitcoin or at least part of it, and help with reviews and testing. The more eyes the better.
What’s important is that the reveal and fix of bug was done in a professional and efficient manner.
@_date: 2018-09-26 01:53:56
48% are updated. So the chances of success of such and attack being successful is diminishing fast. Especially that it’s nodes with economic activity that matters more.

@_date: 2017-12-03 18:35:15
No. There is no irony here. You can run the node 24/7 and for times when you’re offline unexpectedly you can have a backup system. So you operate and collect fees 99.9% time and you pay a small insurance fee to be 100% safe. It’s a good balance of efficiency and safety. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:12:32
Negatives of BCH: It has only 5-10% of the hashrate (thus less secure) and 5-10% of the transaction volume, so less people use it. It has 5-10% of the volume so it's less liquid. The coin is a fork of an older version of Bitcoin, so it doesn't have segwit, which enables cool stuff like Rootstock smart contracts, and Lightning Network, etc, although it could hard fork later to enable such things. Community is quite vicious and toxic, but that's a personal opinion.
Positives of BCH: Because it is currently not used much compared to other popular coins, the fees are low. However occasionally it takes a long time to get a block.
Challenges for BCH: There are literally half a dozen or more Bitcoin forks, like BCH, including Gold, Diamond, Cash Plus, Uranium, Silver, Super, etc. And there are dozens of alts that are equally as cheap and faster than BCH. Some of the coins like LTC or ETH are used by 3-10x more people than BCH. BCH can't win by being the most distributed besides BTC, because all the other Bitcoin forks and popular alts are equal or better in this regard. BCH can't claim to be the best cash, because other coins are faster. There is literally nothing going for BCH.
BTC on the other hand the original crypto currency, most well known, most well respected, and accepted. People sell their property for it. You can buy cars, and virtually anything. The only big downside of BTC is that it can't be used for small transactions currently because the fees are so high $15-20. So unless you're buying something for $500 or more, it's not worth using BTC. However, this is being fixed, so it's likely not going to be a problem on the long run. There is already a technology that slowly increases the transaction capacity, and there are many others that will drastically change the situation. If all goes as planned we will see these technologies early next year. On the upside because BTC has such a high value, and liquidity it's very good for large transactions, that smaller coins can't effectively do because buying or selling large volumes would move the market and the spread between buying and selling would be much more expensive than saving on the $15.

When you have large blocks on BSV, let's say 250MB+ blocks and the blockchain is 250TB+, only large organisations with powerful servers costing 20K+ / month. Thus, you only have a handful of full nodes in the world, and they run on services like AWS, Google Cloud, Alibaba, etc. A government like the USA can order these services to shut the nodes down in a concentrated effort by claiming the network supports terrorism or some other made up or real reason. Even if they can't shut all of them down, losing a large percentage of the validating network creates an incentive for other types of attacks, and will make users lose confidence, making the price crash. Then, the government can go after the remaining nodes with force, and finally shut the whole thing down.
I can't demonstrate this because I'm not a government with such power over cloud services, nor do I have an army to back me up. If BSV ever becomes important and a threat to a given government or a larger group of corporations (like banks) who can order the government to act, they will demonstrate the issue for you. But even without the demonstration, the attack vector is pretty obvious, not?
Compare this to an event with Bitcoin where only 10,000 of the 100,000 nodes are lost due to a government action. Virtually nothing changes, nobody panics, nobody cares, it is business as usual in Bitcoin world. The price initially drops, but once people realise that the attack failed and Bitcoin comes out demonstrating its resilience, the price goes back, and trust in the network gets even stronger.
It's not a problem to have large organisations in the network as long as they don't call the shots. Right now Bitcoin is pretty decentralised. It relies on organisations of various sizes in many jurisdictions, and on many individual users all around the world. Nobody has enough power to kill the network.
I don't really understand your argument about bigger node = more money, etc. what point are you trying to make with this?
LN may hypothetically centralise around hubs, but if those hubs are not beneficial to users, users can route around them and effectively vote them irrelevant to the network. There is no danger of centralisation, or censoring transactions, or something like that. Also, these potential hubs will only command some control on a second layer and no control on the base layer.
There are many types of entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem: users with full nodes, core team, alternative bitcoin implementation devs, large miners, large pools, individual miners, LN dev teams, LN hub operators, wallet devs, Liquid devs, exchanges, merchants, payment processors, publications, evangelists, etc. They all command some power in a certain area, but overall nobody controls the whole system. The only common interest between parties is to make Bitcoin keep working and grow ever bigger.
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:31:40

Copay is ran by Bitpay that is owned by Bitmain, that creates BCH. Copay is intentionally holding back Bitcoin and pushing BCH instead the same way the Bitcoindotcom wallet does. For example neither of these wallets have segwit, let alone the newer features of Bitcoin wallets.
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:04:08
Yes. You are right. And I understand. But without much mining support the old BCH chain would lose value. Some hard-core supports of old consensus rules mining on GPUs and old Asics won’t create a safe chain. Hostile miners will screw with them endlessly rewriting latest blocks and forking the chain endlessly. The value will remain with the Bitmain fork with significant hashing power and thus they would force the new rules on the reluctant community.

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:04:56
Well. Not exactly. Bitcoin is a currency on its own. So you don’t have to cash out to realize profit, you have a large purchasing power without exchanging it to other currencies. It’s different from stocks in this regard, because you cannot buy a car or laptop with apple stock. But you can with btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:55:10
Yes, I like the 2.5m or shorter block time.
100kb blocks every 15 seconds would be great. We would have more orphans, but there are solutions for it. We would get an effective 4x increase, and faster confirmation times. One would still need to wait 10-20 minutes to accumulate enough confirmations to be safe, but for small purchases the first 1-2 confirmations would be sufficient.
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:01:25
You are right that with 1MB we cannot serve the whole world even with second layer solutions. But according to the core roadmap we are getting optimizations like 25% with Schnorr, and later we are raising the block size limit dynamically too. So that century will shrink to a decade and than a single year and eventually we will have the capacity to open a channel for everyone on earth every month.
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:36:10
It’s a good experiment.
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:34:19
Yes. It’s volatile but it’s not that volatile. If you were to receive your pay weekly in Bitcoin, the worse that can happen is a drop in value of around 10-20%. But sometimes the opposite happens. Overall it’s completely survivable. If you keep it for a long time the price goes up, so it’s a good thing. Really, there is no downside switching to Bitcoin altogether. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:25:33
I think Bitmain is smart to embrace LN and offer services on top of it.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:17:01
It is different because you pay the fee once to both pay for the good and to open a channel. Saves block pace and fees.
I think any wallet can support this scheme. Anton just agreed to work with Bitrefill to develop the idea. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:00:14
Anyway, even if that is true, they didn't mine in April either, then restarted, and now paused again. This pattern doesn't suggest they stopped mining BCH, just means they didn't mine last month.  
Also, don't be silly. Not everyone is jihan, just because I don't buy false conclusions.
@_date: 2018-08-18 04:51:19
Not sure. Also, I don’t know if it’s a fork of Bitcoin or not. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:09:37
You don’t know if Bitcoin will become a major currency in the future or not. So I think any argument based on such speculation is mute. 
You admit that if Bitcoin would become what it is designed to do it would be great. I argue it is on the path to become just that. As the market cap grows, as number of transactions grow (especially on LN), and as liquidity grows it is indeed becoming a bigger and bigger new international currency. The trend is positive so far. No reason to think it will reverse. 
Countries issuing cryptos will change nothing. Centralized crypto is not better than digital fiat we already have. If anything such a move will legitimize crypto and introduce more people to it. So, I think if Swiss Francs become crypto, it will help Bitcoin, not take away from it. 
The energy currency idea is not technically feasible, Bitcoin is much more friendly for transferring value.
If you worry about energy consumption. It’s a fair worry, but bear in mind that the next phase of growth will be on LN, which has no big electricity cost. Also, the big picture is different. Mining is good for green energy, because it helps pay back investments faster using the excess energy produced. Bitcoin helps the green economy. I know it’s counter intuitive, but it’s true. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:58:37
Not that simple. If on-chain big blocks was his only objective he could have embraced dozens of other alts, which he didn’t do. For example LTC was there forever and he never cared and they had 4x of Bitcoin’s capacity from inception and committed to raising the blocksize as needed. It’s not just about a certain scaling technology, or crypto’s benefit for the world. 
What he cares about is large blocks, which he believes is a key to wide scale of adoption, AND also most importantly being heavily invested in said coin.
He said most of his wealth is in Bcash, so he will support Bcash no matter what. And Bcash is a pretty poor alt compared to other alts, thus it has little chance competing with Bitcoin on tech grounds. It used to have a chance because it had the same adoption rate of Bitcoin at the fork, but the more time passes, this feature is disappearing. And dozens of Bitcoin forks happened later with better tech too. 
This is a frustrating situation for him, because he is now financially and emotionally invested in something that has less and less chance of being significantly relevant with every passing day. This explains the crazy.

If it’s run on the IBM cloud you have no decentralization. Thus, it’s no better than any other database run by a single corporation.
The point of blockchains is to share trust between many economic players.
Besides this, when you track a tomato on any blockchain, you rely on single individuals to enter the data to the blockchain, which means they can lie and thus the whole thing makes no sense.

@_date: 2018-08-13 22:16:01
They took a bet. It could've turned out that BCH goes into the thousands of dollars range and they would've made a killing. They were / are confident about the ability to manipulate the price because they have all the mining power to support BCH, but the problem is, if they are the only ones mining it, the currency becomes a private coin, which means it has no value no matter the hashing power behind it. The value of crypto comes from decentralization. How do we know they are the only ones? Look at the BCH forks, there is virtually no discussion. It just gets done, because all the mining power is in a single hand. This is NOT good. This means they can do ANYTHING they want to BCH, including raising the block reward or max coins, etc. which is very dangerous for investors.

TLDR; Bitrefill together with a lightning wallet dev prototyped a payment system where they present a single QR code to a buyer which can either be paid through LN, or more interestingly be paid with a single on-chain transaction that both pays for the goods and opens a lightning channel using the change. This creates more channels and more capacity for you to pay for goods on LN in the future.

@_date: 2018-08-14 14:00:00
Yes. But the old chain would have very little hashing power and thus would drop in value. The fork with the more significant hashing power would retain most of the value and thus may be called BCH+ or something, but the end result is that the consensus rules would have changed. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:25:57
The big problem with bitpay's new payment protocol is that none of the mobile wallets that support this protocol support segwit as well. So they are 'forcing' people to use BRD or Copay or other non-segwit wallets on users. Eventually all these wallets will support segwit and then the issue will be resolved but that could take many more months...
DeBitpay resolves this problem:  but you have to trust the site not to change the address you're supposed to pay to the address of a potential attacker who will take your funds.

It’s not an account like Coinbase. It’s an account that generates the seed. I don’t think there are privacy issues here. Anyone else?
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:44:25
That’s correct. Bitcoin is very secure and almost too secure for small transactions. I don’t need my $3 value secured by exahashes of decentralized international mining power, which doesn’t come cheap. The value is too low compared to the security it is given.
However when we are talking about large amounts or huge number of small amounts, we do need that security.
A second layer like LN can ‘spread’ the cost of security over many transactions giving a good balance between level of security and its costs.
If I can open a channel on LN secured by those exahashes and then use that channel for potentially thousands of transactions and maybe routing funds for others too, suddenly the cost of that initial transaction is negligible. And the settlement layer’s core values being solid becomes paramount.
If the base layer is decentralized and secured by unimaginable POW, the second layers can rely on this solid foundation and provide user friendly features.

It didn't divert from the path. This year we will have more transactions buying stuff than last year. And the same is true for all years prior. What makes you say it diverted? The fact that people use it as retirement account didn't stop the commerce use. You have to look at absolute numbers. Typical statistical mistake you are making.
I'm talking about liquidity of being able to sell tens of millions of worth of bitcoins without moving the market, and thus not losing on the spread. Right now you can do this with 10K, or even 100K, but not many millions.
You suggested we should be using electricity as money, but if not: good. We're on the same page then.
You also suggested Bitcoin will be destroyed when countries start issuing their crypto. That's not the case. It will embolden crypto investors because it legitimizes the technology as something not just a fringe group of Bitcoin fanatics trust, but companies trust too. So CHF becoming crypto is very good for Bitcoin. It shows Bitcoin's technology is the future, and it will also make people realize that Bitcoin has properties CHF doesn't as they learn more about crypto.
LN doesn't suffer from the 51% risk, so don't worry about it. On the main chain 51% attack is possible, but very hard to pull off because you need mining infra too, not just electricity. Also, if some entity tried to 51% attack Bitcoin (only Bitmain has a chance) they would risk mining the chain that people don't accept thus waste literally millions of dollars and their reputation. Btw, Bitmain's upcoming IPO is good for us, because it eliminates the possibility that someone buys Bitmain and then uses for nefarious purposes. So, in practice 51% attack is not really feasible. Also, at least two new big players are coming to Bitcoin mining hardware production soon, so mining will get decentralized again fast. Bitmain knows this, this is why they have to IPO until they are market leaders. Bitcoin is far safer than the regular financial system that loses literally billions to criminals regularly who hack the core system like SWIFT itself. Not to mention planned devaluation of the currency and forced forfeitures of all kinds.
Bitcoin mining relies on green energy, mostly cheap hydro, geothermal, and solar. The beauty of bitcoin mining is that you can go where the energy is the cheapest, which is NOT typically fossils. We don't need to remove POW.
You don't understand how Bitcoin mining is helping the green economy, but it's a complex interaction and you're very much invested in explaining anything away that doesn't support your preconceived opinion, so I won't waste my energy trying to explain something that will fly over your head. There is a video by Andreas A. if you are truly interested to learn.
Anyway, I enjoyed our conversation. I'm happy to see that somebody like you, who seems to be really trying to disprove the chances of Bitcoin's success wasn't able to put forward a convincing and logical argument. I was really looking forward to one, I like being challenged. But it was just a rehash of old long disproven ideas.
Btw, why do you waste your time trying to destroy Bitcoin? Are you pissed you didn't believe people hyping Bitcoin in the last 10 years and feel like you're missing out, thus you have to poopoo it to resolve the cognitive dissonance? If that's not the case, what is your motivation? If you don't think it will succeed why do you even bother? Do you disprove flat earthers or other ideas that are truly crazy unlike Bitcoin with the same effort? Are you trying to save Bitcoiners from themselves? I'm really genuinely interested, can you answer honestly?
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:36:59
I think it's overly optimistic to say that between 2017 (0.2% of people) and 2019 (1% of people) we will see a 5x adoption increase. I think we're doing great if we can add 50% a year, which would bring us to 0.45%.

@_date: 2018-08-03 12:01:18
Btc will eventually will have big blocks too once all other options for optimization have ran out and the block size is limiting the adoption. This is the position of the core developers expressed on bitcoin.org. It’s not about not having big blocks ever. It’s about introducing them at the right time when we have solid second layer options to multiply the effect of small block size increases by hundred or thousand fold compared to simply just raising the block for more transactions.

How can somebody comment on something that he admittedly doesn’t fully understands. 
But anyway his concerns have been resolved. LN will bring down the transaction costs to almost nothing and scale utility several magnitudes without raising energy needs considerably for mining or running a node.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:31:38
LN transactions ARE bitcoin transactions, that haven't been broadcasted to the main chain yet. But they are using exactly the same scripting language and signatures as regular bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:23:47
At this rate, it would be responsible for exchanges to stop accepting BCH, or accept it only after 25-30 confirmations.

Your latest argument is basically banks and governments are good therefore we don’t need bitcoin. Guess what: you may be right about this for let’s say 25% of the world.

I realize bcash was very hostile towards Bitcoin trying to literally kill it. I guess karma is a bitch. They should've played the friendly sidechain narrative, kinda like Litecoin did. That way the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash communities could have collaborated while following a different scaling plan. Just like how for example Bitcoin and Litecoin has been collaborating by Litecoin testing segwit for Bitcoin even though the two coins run on a different mining algo, etc.
Regardless, if nothing else, Bcash did us a favour testing large blocks in a real world scenario by mining a few test blocks at \~5-6MB size. That learning will come handy once Bitcoin's blocksize will be raised too, after the other optimization options run out and the technology (faster global internet speeds, cheaper storage capacity, cheaper CPU capacity) is ready for it (as the Core plan puts it).
Bcash also tested a possible attack vector on Bitcoin: the corporate takeover pretending to be a grassroots movement. We learned a lot from this experience. The next time it happens at a larger scale (and no doubt it will) we will be ready. As Andreas predicted, there will likely be a government sponsored Bitcoin fork claiming that the "community wants to keep Bitcoin pure and unchanged", and protest the upcoming softfork that will make Bitcoin more confidential and fungible.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:27:59

So the benefit here for the merchant and customer compared to on-chain payments is that you can pay on LN instantly and safely without waiting for confirms. And as a merchant you can batch together several payments before touching the base chain thus less but larger on-chain transactions, right?
So for example instead of 50 times $5 transactions for a slice of pizza, you can instead settle with one transaction to your cold storage or exchange when you hit the limit of one of your channels at $250, right?
Unless you have to pay for your expenses like flour, electricity or delivery boy, in which case you don’t need to settle of course because your channel frees up for more pizza purchases. 
All this is really exciting. But all this has to be fully automated so the wallet users don’t even have to realize what’s going on. They can just receive and send payments without a glitch every time. A pizza maker has no time or wish to manage and rebalance channels. At the end of the day he should be able to look at the wallet balance to see how business is going and that’s it.

1. How do you connect to your own node? There doesn't seem to be an option in settings for it.
2. No Bech32 support? Yes, there is Segwit, but Bech32 provides further savings on fees and makes transactions smaller.
3. No SAT denomination option?  I think with LN it's becoming the new standard. Very few people use anything else besides BTC and SAT.
4. Looks slick, but I wonder if theming will be a thing in the future in case somebody doesn't like the black/green theme that much.

I don't think you understand what the capabilities of AI are right now. We only have narrow AI, which can do one task, and do it well only if there is sufficient data it can train on. Cracking private keys is not something you can train for because of the fundamental nature of asymmetric cryptography. No matter how many private / public keys you give to an AI to train on, it won't ever be able to derive a formula to get a private key from a public key. We're safe here.
In the future we may have general or strong AI, which can solve general problems and it will be able to reason, etc. Such an AI may come up with ways to break current encryption methods, but we're very far from such a machine. Also, Bitcoin can be improved by changing the encryption algorithm in it with a hard fork. But, we fundamentally don't yet know how to even begin to build such a machine. Probably not our lifetime, but who knows. Who knows how long our lifetime will be.
Once we have strong AI that possesses superhuman intelligence, Bitcoin encryption will be least of our worries. A runaway AI that can outsmart humans, and has its own goals, etc. will take your bitcoins without even breaking encryption. You will hand it over to it willingly probably, because it can convince you to do it by giving you your wildest dreams in return, or by threatening you with your worst fears.

Maximalist doesn’t mean you only believe in Bitcoin.
It means you believe the most well known, oldest, safest, most trusted coin with the most volume will eat everything because of network effects. It attracts the best talent, the most business, the most users, etc. making it stronger with every day comparatively to other coins.
This is to happen despite its initial features, because network effects are more important than anything else when a new and disruptive tech emerges.
But, even features will be better because of talent and users. For example LN is stronger on Bitcoin than any other coin making it the de facto LN coin. 
This strongest coin happens to be Bitcoin, but a maximalist is not religious about Bitcoin specifically. If that most important coin was Litecoin a maximalist would be a Litecoin maximalist. Maximalists are Bitcoiner maximalists not because they necessarily love Bitcoin, they may even hate it. But they recognize that network effects matter more than anything else.

You deposit BTC to bakkt wallet, or buy bitcoin from within bakkt with debit/credit card. Then you can spend at Starbucks and other places without on-chain trasactions.
It makes a lot of sense for lots of small transactions, because it can be easier than LN as you don’t need to setup channels. Bakkt makes money on taking a 1% cut on transactions. 
Downside is you have to trust bakkt not to go down or hold your coins hostage for any reason. So nobody should trust it with more than $100.
I think bakkt has a place in the Bitcoin ecosystem. I expect many such companies to emerge around the world.

Those services mentioned (Airbnb, Uber, etc.) are optimising a certain sector. Bitcoin isn't about optimising an existing service. Bitcoin is a paradigm change. Bitcoin brought a service that never existed before: mathematically guaranteed scarcity and immutability.
If you wanted to compare the invention of Bitcoin to other historical events, it would be like the steam machine. The steam machine didn't just optimise the work men and horses did, but brought about an entirely new paradigm. Let machines do the necessary hard work.
Or, more recently you could compare it to the invention of the web. It didn't just improve printing presses, or the post office. It brought a paradigm shift away from these services and provided a new service which allowed people to communicate in private or in mass directly to each other without a third party between them.
Bitcoin isn't just improving banking or finance, like PayPal or Revolut does. It challenges many fundamentals that have been around for millennia: how money is created, who should be in charge of monetary policy, what makes something valuable, how to guarantee human rights, how to secures human freedom, how to stop funding wars, etc. It's too early to see (at least not me) what the legacy of Bitcoin will be. But it's clearly not an incremental optimisation, but a much bigger thing.
So forget comparing Bitcoin to Google or Facebook. It's way bigger than those.

Create a wallet with 12 words. Send the btc to an address. Note down the public address. 
Then create an envelope with a card in it that contains both information making sure the recipient understands the 12 words are for their eyes only. 
This way they can keep the envelope for the future and just monitor the public address, or redeem it immediately if they are willing to learn. 
I also suggest you take a copy of the 12 words for yourself and keep it in a safe place. Many times people I gifted this way came back to me years later when the value went up to ask for the private key because of course they lost it. It’s nice if you can give it to then again. Also, if they really don’t care, or pass away and never redeem the funds you can recover them and buy a private jet. :)

Be realistic guys, Bitcoin currently can't even handle a single city's transactions. Not even if LN was ready for the prime time. Bitcoin could be used for high value transactions, like if somebody wants to buy a house, boat, car, an airplane ticket. But not for bread or mangos.
There is an extra capacity of about 100,000 transactions a day on-chain, and during peak times which coincide with Venezuela's time zone, the mempool already goes up regularly to 20,000 unconfirmed transactions, which means you would have to wait hours to get your first confirmation or outpay other transactions in fees, which is not ideal for a country like Venezuela, where even $1 is a lot of money right now.
We can't expect millions of Venezuelans to run their own LN nodes that costs hundreds of dollars and requires good internet connection to download blocks continuously and then connect their up-to-date smart phones to their nodes with LN wallets. This is way to expensive and difficult of an on-boarding process at this point. I know all this will be solved, and we will have simple mobile LN wallets that connect to full nodes automatically, and open bidirectional channels automatically, etc., but we're not there yet.
Even if only used the 100,000 transactions per day to onboard people to LN, it would take 90 days to open 3 channels for everybody assuming nobody is closing channels. There is no easy way to open multiple channels with one transaction yet.
**Currently, if Venezuelans wanted to use crypto for everyday purchases, using Liquid's LBTC would be the best option, because the confirmation time is one minute, there is ample capacity, fees are very low, and you can transact on chain, without the need to manage channels. In addition the transactions are confidential, which is a huge plus when you live in an authoritarian regime. At any point you can go back to BTC without risks if you wanted to. The greenaddress wallet is perfectly functional, and they can even run their own nodes on the desktop if there is a need for higher confidence.**
Alts are not really a good option, because they are not as well accepted, there is less liquidity and suffer from much bigger volatility than Bitcoin.

The winters are getting longer between booms as the asset matures.
I think the next boom will happen 3 months after halvening, starting September 2020. The reasons for this are:
* Lots of new Bitcoin users are added over the years to the ecosystem (including people who grow into adults in the last 3 years), so the value of the network has grown, there is more demand for Bitcoins.
* Halving reduces supply of new coins, which will be felt 2-3 months after halving takes effect.
* People by that time almost completely forget the pains of the 20K &gt; 3K drop. It will feel like irrelevant ancient history. If anything it will just support the idea that 20K and more is not impossible. The negative experience turns into a positive possibility. The prices around \~5K normalise and anything below 10K starts to feel OK for long term investment.
* Technology for scaling Bitcoin will have ripened, and doesn't cause a big concern to investors anymore.
* New devices and improved software makes it significantly safer and easier to use Bitcoin, so people who were anxious about the technology will start dipping their toes into the water.
* Institutional investors and even small countries started buying giving confidence to everyday users, and making the market more stable.
But the price will very carefully and slow start rising before that all the way to 8K, before booming.

@_date: 2019-03-11 17:32:40
Ah. Good point.
If the network is too expensive to transact on, the utility of the network decreases, thus less people will want to run a full node, because they can’t afford to use the network often enough to warrant full nodes. 
On the other hand if the full nodes are too resource intensive, people can’t run them. 
So there is a fine balance between these two.

Alt season will likely never come. It was based on the anticipation that some other coin can take over Bitcoin, and people betted on which one it will be. But Bitcoin as expected can serve virtually all use cases and thus there is significantly less real need for altcoins than anticipated. Whatever innovation a new coin brings can be potentially be built into bitcoin's ecosystem either on chain, or on a side chain, or on a second layer, or in a way that we haven't though of yet. Instant transactions, super low fees, deterministic contracts, confidentiality, etc. all available within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Bootstrapping a new coin is incredibly hard and funnily enough if any new coin comes about, it will be a bigger challenge to existing alts than to Bitcoin. Imagine a new coin which is 1000x better in terms of transaction throughput compared to current coins, and it is also fully decentralised? What coin will suffer if the new coin gains any traction? Bitcoin or XRP / TRON? The alts that are built on top of that specific promise.

No. You only make one transaction every time your channel is depleted. So for example if you buy 1000 coffees, you only make 1 on chain transactions to be able to buy another 1000 coffees. 
The benefit of LN is that you effectively batch together tons of small and back and force payments that could potentially be done over years and settle them all at once. Potentially making millions of transactions off chain and just one or two (if you want to close) on-chain.
@_date: 2019-03-09 12:04:01
A comment asking about which coin had a premine neglected to mention that Bitcoin Cash (aka. BCH, BAB, Bcash) also had a sort of "premine". Bitmain was manipulating the hashpower/difficulty after the fork so they can mine lots of blocks quickly. This is why the BCH chain is 6,700 blocks ahead of Bitcoin. That's 83,750 coins! I think that qualifies as a well masqueraded pre-mine. This will bite BCH in the proverbial ass because halving will now arrive sooner, which means profitability will be cut in half for miners, which means some miners will migrate back to mining to Bitcoin instead of BCH, which means the security will drop on BCH and thus it will be prone to attacks. More on this later.
This manipulation created wild oscillations of difficulty and block times, which made BCH unpredictable and useless, so they had to stop it and fork the chain again, so the difficulty can adjust faster to hashpower.
This created a dangerous code change for BCH, because it makes the potential spiral of death scenario possible, where falling price reduces hashpower, which reduces security, which scares investors and thus reduces price further. This cycle goes on until both the price and hashpower potentially goes to zero. Not in practice though. There are ideological coin holders who will not sell at any price, and will buy more and more as the price drops.
This scenario is less of a risk on Bitcoin because the hashrate would only drop every \~2 weeks, so the security stays high for days/weeks until markets can recover and thus the hashrate won't drop further down. On Bitcoin we have a different kind of risk, which could happen if price and thus hashrate suddenly dropped by a huge amount like \~70%. In this situation, it would take 6 weeks for the difficulty to drop, and the number of transactions processed will be only 1/3 of normal, which could create chaos with fees going stratospheric. However, such a sudden drop is very unlikely to happen, while BCH's gradual spiral of death scenario is a realistic scenario, and can be observed to be happening in the last few months already.
On top of this issue, when BCH's hashrate and price are relatively low for example $40 and &lt;1% of hashrate, some bad actors with existing or rented miners can first short BCH, and then 51% attack the chain with just 1% of hashpower for a short while. This way, they can profit from the falling prices. At this point exchanges will stop accepting withdrawals and deposits, which will reduce prices even more. This will make it increasingly unprofitable to mine BCH even for the remaining ideological miners.
This is not an unprecedented scenario. The Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) fork did this recently and the price of BCH indeed crashed drastically, and virtually all transactions seized for a long time. The creation of BSV coins at least gave some value back to BCH holders. However, a malicious attacker may not continue mining the competing forked chain, instead start multiple forked chains over and over confusing everybody about what chain to follow, destroy confidence in the BCH chain, and make it impossible to transact on BCH for the fear or replay attacks. A similar attack happened to a low hashpower coin Bitcoin Gold (BTG) in May 2018. Subsequently BTG went from $80 to $25. And it never recovered. Now it's like $12 only.
Right now, BCH holders have to trust that the two big bag holders and miners: Bitmain and Ver will protect the chain no matter how much it costs them against such attackers like they did against the BSV fork, which they failed to prevent at the end. There is no incentive for any other miners to stay on the side of these two entities to protect a dying chain. If any of the two big guys quits at any point during an attack, or more attackers come on board just for the heck of it, the BCH coin will be virtually dead within 24 hours.
@_date: 2018-10-07 08:54:36
On those 12 blocks they lost something like $50-60K. It’s nothing compared to the half billion they lost on BCH’s price collapsing. 
For the same reason Bitpay that is owned by Bitmain is not releasing Segwit support for Copa and Bitpay wallets.
They want to sabotage Bitcoin as much as possible while pretending that it’s not their doing.

I think he didn’t want destruction on purpose. He genuinely fails to understand that keeping bitcoin decentralized is what it gives value. He thinks the more transactions, the more valuable the chain. But that’s just part of the story. You could do millions of transactions a second with a simple mysql database. It won’t make such a centralized coin valuable in any sense of the word. 
He also can’t understand (because he’s rich) why would it cause the average joe a problem to run a node that has to process 10-20x the amount of data that Bitcoin does Today. He thinks in terms of latest dedicated hardware, but most of us run nodes on our older laptops we use for work on modest internet connections. If the blockchain grows 10-20x faster, lots of us will be failing to be able to maintain our own node, which means we are not enforcing rules, which means we are starting to go back to the old banking system.
He also believes that he can force the bitcoin community to accept his preferred rules because he has money and he has the backing of the rich Bitmain. But he fails to realize that if he were to succeed this way, he would actually prove to the world that decentralized coins won’t work, because the rich can force new rules on users. 
Him trying and failing to change Bitcoin is actually the best thing that can happen to Bitcoin. It tested one of the most important attack vectors. His fork ironically gives more confidence to people who understand the reason Bitcoin has value at all, and thus increase the valuation of BTC.

I think this is a brilliant idea, but I think it would be best if the purchases were not micro-purchases, but consolidated weekly, otherwise you will end up with tons of small extra transactions, which can become costly.
There could be an option that allows you to buy back whenever the price is X% lower than the 'selling' price. You can't afford to wait with spending usually, but you can afford to wait for buying back typically. So the app can take care of this for you, and thus effectively the more you spend the more bitcoins you will have over time.

I think the biggest danger with BCH and coins of that kind is that the mining is basically centralized. If Bitmain and Roger Ver decides to do a hard fork of any kind, they can push it through without much opposition, as we could see in the last two BCH hard forks.
It's like with dictatorships in general. If the dictator happens to have good ideas and high morals, it's great. He can push the developments through because there is no opposition. But power and money corrupts, and dictators are just humans. They will start acting irrationally, and ruin their own creations every time. Without exception. On the long term dictatorships always end up badly for themselves and everybody they prey on.

OK, but that's a different argument. I just argued the point that early investors are not paid for nothing.
You're saying jealousy will kill tech? I don't think so. Those who fail to invest for 10-20 years because they can't take any risk, will be the ones that will adopt the tech reluctantly because they have no other option, because everyone else is already using it. This was the case with trains, cars, electricity, the internet most recently, and will be the case with bitcoin.
When most employers, and most merchants prefer bitcoin you will be the odd one out insisting on paying with dollars. You will adopt it not because you want to gain on it, but because it makes your life easier. You will adopt it because you don't want to be subject to arbitrary banking rules, slow and expensive transfers, and most importantly steady inflation that destroys the value of your fiat.

Bitpay and copay wallet doesn’t support it which is a problem because both have significant market-share. Too bad they are both in Bitmain’s pocket, and the more Segwit succeeds the less the million BCH they own is worth. So conflict of interest.

@_date: 2017-08-30 15:31:08
Right now that is the case, which is great. The mempool is empty, because the difficulty is low, thanks to BCH 'stealing' hashing power in the previous difficulty cycle. The bitcoin network is now mining more than 6 blocks an hour. Once the difficulty adjusts up 8-10% in a few days, we will drop back to the normal 6 blocks, and we will likely unfortunately see longer confirmation times and higher fees.

That is entirely correct. Some people speculate with it. Others buy it for their (early) retirement. And many use it increasingly for various purposes that are related to more transactional activities. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:17:45
I will start here:
Helps bitcoin businesses prove investors that there is capacity to serve more people on-chain on the short term, and on LN (which requires opening channels) on the long term.
Helps miners collect more fees from more users from on-chain transactions and on-ramping them to LN.
Increases the block size, thus makes it harder for home users to run full nodes.
It misses the opportunity to include more improvements into the HF.
It is done too fast. We first need to see how Segwit performs.
It's a one off increase, should be a continuous slow increase, so we don't have to HF again in a few years for this purpose.
It left out Core's opinion and buy in, which is an integral part of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Investing early in a tech is highly risky. If you are lucky you are rewarded. But it’s not a certainty. It’s not nothing to take insane risks with your money. It’s serious business, which requires lots of learning, risk calculation, and balls.
Without such investors no new tech requiring capital would ever take off. So investors bring a benefit to society as a whole. You should give them respect they deserve. It’s a job like any other.

I think you got the wrong idea. The official core roadmap includes a block size increase after Segwit, Schnorr and maybe some other optimizations have been exhausted. And they also have an emergency block size increase plan in place as well. So, don’t count on it never to be increased.

They (BTC and BCH) both have the same confirmation speed of \~10 minutes.
If you're looking for a coin with faster confirmation you may want to consider LTC with 2.5m or ETH under a minute, but it's not that simple. Faster confirmations do not mean the same level of security at the first confirmation. Larger coins like Bitcoin have much more hashing power behind them, so a single confirmation on the Bitcoin blockchain gives you much more security and confidence that the coins your received or sent are safe than a single confirmation on any other blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain has 13x more hashing power behind it than Bitcoin Cash, so you need to wait effectively at least 3-6 Bitcoin Cash confirmations to come close to a single Bitcoin confirmation, which means it will take \~30-60 minutes on Bitcoin Cash to get to similar confidence levels as \~10 minutes on Bitcoin. Same concept applies for Litecoin and Ethereum, but it's harder to compare because they use a different mining algorithm.
Also, consider that on Bitcoin (and to a lesser extent on Litecoin) you have the option to use the Lightning Network, which offer virtually instant (1-3 seconds) transactions, so if you're looking for the ultimate security and speed, Bitcoin with Lightning Network is what you're looking for. As an added benefit you can also swap between Bitcoin and Litecoin on the Lightning Network. Ethereum also has an experimental system like Lightning Network, called the Raiden network, but it's not compatible with the Lightning Network, so you can't swap ETH with BTC or LTC on Raiden/LN. The downside of LN is that it is quite new, so there aren't many wallets, merchants or exchanges supporting it yet. It will take a few more month until you can use LN extensively, but if you buy Bitcoin now at least you own the right token to onboard to LN eventually.

If they were to implement a decentralized version like LN or Liquid they could truly help Bitcoin.

This suggests that most of Bitcoin’s use is focused in the USA. Node distribution confirms this too. 
This means a market 20x bigger than the USA is still not using Bitcoin on a level that the USA is using it, which in itself is small.
Remember the value of the network grows 10x with every user base doubling. If only the rest of the world catches up to the USA, we will see a 4 magnitude or 10,000x growth in network value, which doesn’t necessarily means that the price grows 10,000x. The price could grow 100-1,000x and the rest of the value will be projected as price stability due to massive liquidity. You will be able to buy or sell $10M worth of Bitcoin without moving the price more than 0.01%. 
To serve the 20x capacity we need the following scaling improvements:
* Further Bech32 address type (bc1) adoption: +5%
* Further Segwit adoption, so we reach 80% to get approximately: +25%
* More batching by exchanges: +25%
* Schnorr signature upgrade: +40%
* High economic LN use: +400%
* High sidechain use (Liquid + Rootstock): +200%
You don’t just add these up, they multiply each other’s effect, so it gives us at least 10x in the next 3-4 years.
At this point technology will allow us to run nodes on mobile devices (possible even Today) because of 5-6G internet, TBs of storage being standard and various wireless power and high capacity battery technologies. 
We will have a million nodes around the world, with 100,000 being publicly visible. 10x increase compared to Today. 
We will be able to introduce a dynamic block size increase to 2MB + Segwit, which will grow this rich ecosystem another 2x over the next 10 years without compromising the main core value of Bitcoin: decentralization. In total that will bring us to 20x scaling. 
This is a lot of work, but at this point we will have 100,000,000, and the price is in millions of dollars per Bitcoin range. The year is 2030.
If you think that’s a lot, think again. Facebook has 20x as many users already Today. Even in 2030 Bitcoin is in early days in terms of adoption.

* 1MB can serve 250K transactions / day on chain.
* 1M / day with Segwit adoption.
* Another +25% with Shnorr signatures HF.
* If LN gets adopted and we assume a person (or company, or other automated entity) only opens and closes a channel once a month in average, we could serve ~10M making virtually any number of transactions.
* If we want to scale beyond 10M, and we can't come up with new ideas to compress transactions, we will need to increase the block size. With a 1GB block size we could serve the whole world of 10B entities.

There’s lot to criticize, but overall the FED is doing what they can to help the economy. We should not hurt them for being old school. 
Bitcoin will not wipe them out like an asteroid. First, Bitcoin is not ready to go global yet. Second, it will be a slow and steady conversion of the power structure. Nothing sudden or dramatic. 
While in the past people put their trust in government organizations to keep their money safe, now more and more people diversify into decentralized solutions like gold and Bitcoin, because global ownership and use of these keeps  them more stable than any government organization can ever can stabilize a single local currency on the long term.
The USD is used in many countries outside the USA, but it’s not international money. You can’t buy food with it in Thailand or in Czechia. You can however buy food directly with Bitcoin in many places. Nobody accepts gold. So, already at this early stage Bitcoin is more international than the USD. Still ways to go of course, but it’s clear which one will become more international and thus more valuable in the future.

@_date: 2018-10-12 06:07:10
While I like the idea, currently I don’t fully appreciate the benefit. Is it really a problem for exchanges to send BTC between them? I don’t really think so. Even if the fees were high, a few dollars on millions of dollars is quite nothing. And the speed? Do you really need to be able to send funds faster than 10 mins?
I think liquid is more useful for everyday spending if the fees are super low and block speed is just 1 minute or less as planned. Even if the safety is not like your on chain BTC, because theoretically the federation could collude and take your L-BTC, but with small amounts who cares about such an unlikely event.
Liquid is cool because it’s still BTC, yet it has the properties of new alts that are faster and have lower fees.
BTC LN and Liquid is killing the use case of LTC, BCH, etc. And S-BTC (Rootstock) is killing the use case of ETH, NEO, etc. I’m grateful for all the work and experimentation alts are doing and I feel sorry if they will be killed by the network effects of BTC and its sidechains and second layers solutions.

They both have a place for different reason and in different situations. Decentralized 2nd layer solutions safeguard you against 3rd party exit scams. However you may still use 3rd parties for small and frequent transactions.

Taking your argument to the extreme, what value does a network has if all blocks were empty? Zero because no transactions are processed. 
What value does it have with 1GB blocks? Also zero because it will be centrally run by a few entities who can afford to pay huge costs of running nodes, which reduces decentralization to effectively nothing. 
The highest value lies somewhere in between the two. It’s ok to have a block size cap, but it should allow through tons of transactions to be useful.

The core team's official scaling plan posted on bitcoin.org includes block size increase after all other options for optimization have been exhausted including Schnorr signatures. I expect we will be raising the block size in about 2-3 years tops. However it won't be a one off increase, but a safe and dynamic one that won't need to be amended again and again with hard forks.

A short difficulty adjustment like 1-3 days would be more susceptible to random unlucky or lucky days, where difficulty may adjusts high or low for no good reason, which could potentially be disruptive.
Imagine if the difficulty goes really high like +30% and thus many miners stop mining Bitcoin because another coin is more profitable to mine at this time, which moves the price down, thus scaring away even more bitcoin miners, thus making the high difficulty readjustment way longer than normal. When it eventually does adjusts, it may go way down. This brings back the miners even from competing blockchains resulting in blocks being mined at +100% rate for a short period of time. 'Cheap' newly mined bitcoins flood the market, which brings the price down again, etc. It could also go the other way of course, which brings me to the next potential problem.
If the re-adjustment time is short miners could afford to 'attack' the chain by artificially staying away or using unusually high amount of hashing power. Miners could go short or long on bitcoin to take advantage of the predictable price movement.
If you have a relatively long time like 2 weeks we have now, the chance of such random variation happening or the incentive to perform an attack is extremely low.

Satoshi himself answered this question:


Currently the fees make up 2.41% of the block reward. After the halving in less than a year this will increase to an estimated 5.87%. Every 4 years the percentage of the fee will increase until it's practically 100% of the reward.
This brings up the question: Are we expecting the fees to increase 50x on the Bitcoin network to provide the same reward value in $? Are we going to see $100+ transaction fees in a few decades?
The answer is no. In the future computers and the internet will be much faster (10x-100x), just like it sped up in the last 10 years. So, we will have the ability to increase the block size without compromising the decentralisation on Bitcoin. Currently we have \~1+3 MB blocks with \~3K transactions per block. In the future (10+ years) we may have \~10+30 MB blocks, and thus we can get away with sub $10 fees because the fees will come from \~30K transactions per block, and at that point $10 is going to be worth like $2-3 only anyway, so roughly the same fee level as Today.
The other alternative is that fees will indeed increase to high levels, but most people won't be transacting often on the base blockchain. 99% of the transactions will be done on sidechains and second layers, like LN or Liquid. For example, you will make a single $100 value ($30 in Today's value) on-chain transaction to create an LN wallet with multiple channels and use it for years. Think of it like getting a checking account for a single transaction on the base layer that secures your future LN transactions for years to come. Or, you may get paid, and you pay for your stuff using Liquid Bitcoins on Liquid, and you only make base Bitcoin layer transactions to secure your savings if you have too much Liquid Bitcoin in your wallet, or when you sell your house, or something similar of high value, where you don't want to accept any security tradeoffs that a given sidechain may have.
It's likely we will have a combination of the two options above. We will have a minor blocksize increase to support second layer and sidechains operating safely, but most transactions will not happen on the base layer, simply because second/sidechain layers can offer faster confirmations and nearly zero fees, which is optimal for small everyday transactions.

Even if LN was ready 100% and every person only needs a single channel, for China we would need 1 billion transactions. It would take about 6 years if we do nothing else but opening channels, and never close any to onboard everyone. This is of course not feasible. The blocks are already nearly full with legit transactions. We could double the block size and we could use channel factories, but still it would be years. And we're not even talking about businesses, and machines that all need accounts and channels for a functioning Bitcoin economy. We're not yet ready. A small island nation, using LN efficiently, maybe, but not even a mid sized country.
There IS a way Bitcoin could be adopted by China, but with a huge caveat: If centralised organisations provided custodial Bitcoin service, like WeChat provides custodial Yuan Today. WeChat with their centralised databases could allow people to hold and spend Bitcoin. It would not be real Bitcoin usage, and WeChat could do fractional reserve banking and other tricks. But that's the only way I can imagine it working.

Without radiation we would not be here. Literally. Life and evolution depends on radiation damage (and chemical damage to a smaller extent) to the DNA or evolution doesn't happen. You do believe in evolution, right? So the blanket statement that radiation is not good for living beings is fundamentally wrong.
Too much radiation destroys too much DNA and cells and that's bad, but it's true for everything. Water is necessary, but too much hydration is deadly. Heart is necessary but too much and you're cooked. Etc. You don't want to ban water or heating, right?
Nuclear energy even with all the accidents doesn't release enough extra radiation to the world that would make it unsafe. It is still safer than other forms of energy, especially fossil by several magnitudes. So, all in all our best option is nuclear to save the world. All serious environmentalist agree. Even huge names like Mark Lynas. As an environmentalist you must know and respect him, not?
Nuclear bombs and energy do not go hand in hand. There are types of nuclear energy that don't have the capability to create plutonium for bombs. We just need to build reactors that are only good for energy and do not help make bombs.

The chart I linked shows the percentage of Segwit transactions being unusually high, which is a good thing if it was a trend going forward. But it may be just a one off. High Segwit adoption is good for Bitcoin transaction capacity.
The other metric being discussed is the amount of Bitcoin sent through the network, in dollar value, which is also unprecendented high. Here is another chart that shows the same: [
So far the record was $55 billion sent per day. That was in the peak in late 2017. Now, the new record is a whopping \~$240 billion+ thanks to a bunch of blocks that had giant chunks of bitcoin transferred. Example transaction with \~3K+ BTC: [

It's not just Bcashers. Altcoins in general are down 90% or more. Bitcoin eats everybody's lunch. Bitcoin first layer, Bitcoin 2nd layer and side chains cover 90% of all use cases. There is simply little left for other coins.
And the competition in altcoin world is crazy. Only about 50 coins have any economic activity, out of \~5K. This is completely expected though. It's the winner takes all effect that can be observed in all areas of life.
You probably can name the fastest US swimmer, but do you know the second one? Maybe you do, but I bet you don't know the 5th or 7th. Sponsors know this, thus Phelps got 90% of the sponsor money. And the thousands of other swimmers got chump change, even though they are all excellent swimmers probably separated from Phelps by just a fraction of a second. But, people have a limited mental capacity, and thus beyond number 3 nobody cares, and these top performers are rewarded at an irrationally high level.
This is the foundation of Bitcoin maximalism. It doesn't matter if you come up with the best features for a new crypto at this point. Very little chance it will gain significant traction, especially when all the best coders want to work on Bitcoin (or maybe Ethereum) because they are the only two coins that really matter.
It has to be complete paradigm shift like Bitcoin was to fiat to challenge Bitcoin. And even then Bitcoin didn't replace fiat instantly. It will take decades to make any significant impact even for a paradigm shift. BCH is very far from a paradigm shift of any kind. LOL.

Nah, even if you use an SPV wallet, you can change where you pull the data from. If the node you previously trusted becomes rogue, you can change it to one that is following the principles you support. So even if you are not running your own node, you still have control and vote over what is the valid chain.
In other words, even if miners wanted to change the 21 to 42, as long there is at least one full node that runs the old code, all users could reject the new chain and only accept payment on the old chain, thus enforcing value on the old chain, and make the new chain have no or very little value, thus indirectly forcing miners to switch to mining the old chain, and thus orphaning the rogue chain.
Users ARE in control of the economic policy.

I linked one of the many permanently safe places already. Again, safe is relative. Is it safe against unforeseeable events? Well, we're as certain about their safety as we reasonably can! There is always a 1:1,000,000 or whatever the actual number is that things can go south.
Nuclear waste doesn't trigger a catastrophic chain reaction either. To create a chain reaction you need to have a nuclear bomb. It's very hard to build such a bomb. It doesn't just happen on its own. Nuclear waste is not a source of human death that we should be concerned about at all.
Climate change is caused by people who are afraid of nuclear energy. We had the technology (nuclear) to replace coal for decades but the fossil lobby successfully hired organisations like Greenpeace to create fear in people against nuclear energy, and plant a false hope that other clean energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal can replace fossils, so we should not bother with nuclear.
The truth is nuclear is safer than any other source of energy. I said above what to google to confirm this. And evidently we could not replace fossils with other green technologies. The fossil industry managed to increase their wealth, and people with a good heart but little understanding of the energy industry, and the risks of various solutions supported them. Manipulation and ignorance causes the tragic death of our world. I would like to say it's on you, but you are just being manipulated, so I can't blame you. You're as much a victim as me. It's just even more painful to watch the world burn for those who knew all along that we had a solution.
Also, please stop with this nuclear lobby bullshit. It's an ad hominem fallacy. Why do people jump to such conclusions all the time? You hold a viewpoint and I'm not trying to discredit you by suggesting you're a Greenpeace activist paid by the oil lobby. On r/btc I'm being accused of being a paid Bitcoin supporter. Here I'm a paid nuclear supporter. Even if somebody offered money to explain my views on the internet, I would not take such a job, because both issues are much more important than money.

When you sell Bitcoin you get USDT on those exchanges. Then you sell this USDT for actual fiat. Traders do not even exit to fiat at all, just sit in USDT. So as the market grows and more USDT is locked in transfers or in traders wallets, the USDT supply grows. This is organic.
It's not true that USDT is only ever increasing, and it's not true that nobody ever redeems it for fiat. The supply has decreased in the past when withdrawals were higher than deposits. And literally every few minutes somebody is selling USDT for fiat.
Whether the organisation behind USDT is running a fractional reserve banking — I don't know. But that's a different question. Literally all banks in the world do that. USDT is a tiny thing in the sea of trillions of fiat money that is all a house of cards. That's why we have Bitcoin, don't stay in USDT for more time than you absolutely have to.

It's called the nirvana fallacy.
The 'waste' is not really waste anyway. It's a misnomer really. It's just fuel that hasn't been fully spent. New nuclear reactor models can burn through this 'waste', which is why this 'waste' is not 'thrown out', but stored for future use.

Anyway, for other interested readers:
1. Wladimir the lead core developer is not paid by Blockstream, but by another organization.
2. There are only a few core developers out of literally several dozen active ones, who are are also working at Blockstream.
3. Lightning Network, the first 'side chain' or second layer chain has been built by multiple companies not just Blockstream. It's completely free to join and use like Bitcoin itself. Lightning Labs is one of the leading ones. Nobody is making an unfair profit off anyone. You can run a lightning node yourself and make money on fees if you want. Blockstream is not a gatekeeper of any kind. LN is really successful already processing tons of transaction every day despite the constant claim of Lightning being vaporware, etc.
4. Segwit brought an effective 2x increase in capacity. It's adoption is already around 40% and with every percent more on-chain capacity is opening up for the network. Despite the doomsday predictions of 'honestly worried' users like yourself, segwit is working just as designed.
5. The Core team's next optimization and capacity increase is schnorr signatures which doesn't charge anything to anybody unlike the video claims. It just makes bitcoin more confidential, faster, cheaper, and it adds more effective capacity to a block because it replaces multiple input signatures with just one.
6. After schnorr the core team is planning a dynamic block size increase that will gradually raise the blocksize to make sure network needs, spam risks and the requirements to run a full node are carefully balanced. This is documented on bitcoin.org.
Ouch. ;)

I know what you're saying, but I think the video was excellent. Technical details are not important in the grand scheme of things. If you want to predict the future you should not look at unpredictable small details, you need to look at the big picture, which is what he wisely did.
The only thing I found in the video that could be questioned in terms of rhetoric is the comparison with Google. As he said, there were 20 other search engines before Google, yet Google could win and dominate this market. If we were to apply this to Bitcoin, what if Bitcoin is Yahoo! and Google is yet to come? I think he should've explained that none of those early search engines fully dominated the market. They were all small players competing with a roughly similar marketshares and only reaching 50% for short periods of time. None of them were one of thousands with over 50% market share for 10 years.
Also, in case of search engines multi-homing (using multiple services at the same time) is easy. At early times the network effect wasn't as strong as with services like money or social media. However, now that user data drives the quality of the searches, Google can't be unseated because they have the most data, thus they can provide the best service. There is a danger for Google however. They are a centralised entity. Anything happens to the organisation, their dominance won't protect them anymore. This is not a problem with Bitcoin. As Andreas explained, if there is a problem with some parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem, a bunch of people will fill the space and fix it. There will always be heroic people who will help Bitcoin out and push it forward. It's very difficult to imagine a scenario where everybody in the space suddenly loses interest completely, and nobody is willing to pick up the baton.

"Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the basic software engineering from being the limiting factor."

I remember this well because at the time lots of people around me were discussing Bitcoin and Kevin was the investor I believed to be smart and worth listening to, so I was eager to hear what his take on crypto is. However, I can't find that interview online.
Now, he's somewhat changing his tune. He likely jumped ship when Bitcoin was in the gutters, for 2 years or so and now has no significant position in Bitcoin. This may be embarrassing for a celebrity investor especially if he didn't just not get exposed, but bought high and sold low. The "cryptocrap" he bought at the University was not his first encounter with crypto.
It's obvious he is pissed about crypto, because he uses derogative and emotionally charged language. He can't be factual or balanced about the subject. Nor does he have knowledge or insight into the subject. He's not worth listening to at this point.

He compares Bitcoin to Uber, suggesting both are just overhyped technologies. Well, Uber replaced a huge percentage of the taxi business in **173** countries. They do 15 million rides a day. Bitcoin does 300-400K transactions a day on chain plus unknown number on LN. If Bitcoin reaches 15M per day with various efficiency improvements and second layer solutions, I think Bitcoin will be a global success, like Uber is. What else can we ask? I don't understand his argument... :D
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:21:34
LN payments always work great when you have a channel opened to the operator, which makes total sense when you buy something frequently from one place like bitrefill. The cool feeling comes when you pay to bitrefill even though you don't have a channel to them: routing. It used to not work reliably, but increasingly it does as the network gets more connected. Pretty cool stuff.

@_date: 2019-08-23 06:29:57
Bitcoin has way more work than that alt, and not by a little:
* BTC - 574K Trillion Hashes
* BCH - 70K Trillion Hashes
BTC is ahead by 8.2 times, or 820%, and the difference is increasing  by \~43 Trillion Hashes every month. In about 2 month BTC generates as much Hashes as BCH had in it its entire history, and BTC will have 10x more work behind it overall.
Interesting fact: If hypothetically BTC miners wanted to, they could roll back BCH's blockchain all the way to the fork in 26 days with the current BTC hash rate. Nobody gives a shit in practice to do this in practice of course.
In order for BCH to be considered Bitcoin they would have to not only flip the price and hashing power, but also maintain the difference for at least an entire year, not only defending it against BTC but also against all other SHA256 coins. Even then, it would not be considered the valid chain by tens of thousands of Bitcoin nodes, so it's a virtual impossibility at this point. Which is why the market is giving it less and less chance of happening as time goes by.
It was a poor idea to market BCH as Bitcoin, because it's not defendable. It was a poor idea to market BCH as the biggest block coin, because it's easy to supersede it as BSV and other coins already did. It was a poor idea to market BCH as cash, because LN and many other coins work better for this purpose. It is also currently a poor idea to market it as the asset coin, because ETH is better known for this use case by far, and Bitcoin will do it better on the second layer with LN based assets (cheaper and faster than ETH or BCH) or Bitcoin Rootstock which is an ETH based sidechain.
BCH could've been a good coin if it was not hostile to Bitcoin, but cooperate with Bitcoin developers, and be more like a sidechain for payments secured by Bitcoin, have atomic swaps on a BCH LN network with Bitcoin, etc. But that ship has sailed too with the introduction of Liquid a few months ago, that is both confidential and 10x faster than BCH in terms of first confirmation and already has Liquid LN with working atomic swaps.
The only thing remains for BCH from a utility point of view is that it is the only alt coin accepted by Bitpay merchants. However, there are other merchants that accept alts and even Bitcoin LN payments, but not BCH. Example: the highly popular Bitrefill. At the same time, the market is changing fast. Many merchants are moving away from Bitpay and choosing other merchant software like BTC pay. And consumers wanting to spend Bitcoin don't rely on Bitcoin accepting merchants, they simply use a credit card that holds crypto and allows conversion on the fly. So, this remaining benefit is slipping away too.
I think BCH still has some fanatic supporters, so there is a chance it will linger around for a long time, but I think competing alts with interesting new features will make it hard for BCH to stay in the top 5 or even top 10 cryptos in the mid term.

Online Bitcoin use would be more often than debit/credit for sure. So by this standard Bitcoin for me is already the currency of the internet. And I'm not alone. There are probably close to a million people like me. Look, somebody makes 10M Bitcoin transactions a month. I'm sure it's not all just transactions to send money to and from exchanges. Not to mention the large number of LN transactions that are certainly only for payments.

All this doesn't prove there is no 'safe' place to store waste. It logically doesn't follow. Safety is not a binary thing. Everything in life has a certain risk. You can die from walking down stairs. In fact a thousand people die that way in the UK alone every year. Does that mean the concept of stairs is not safe for human habitats in general? If you are thinking in absolutes, the answer is yes, it's not safe. But if you're being a reasonable human you will understand that while stairs are a risk, it's an unavoidable technology with acceptable risk, and the alternatives are worse in terms of mortality.
When somebody says something is 'safe', they mean it has a very low chance of unintended outcome, but it doesn't mean you can't find examples of such accidents. Nuclear energy is magnitudes safer than stairs or other sources of energy. So if you're OK with stairs, you should be OK with nuclear energy. If not, you have an irrational fear of nuclear energy, thus you need to revisit your premises.
@_date: 2019-08-24 12:50:06
Nuclear tech is the most regulated thing in the world. Can we do even better? Probably. Since it can save our world, we should take the minor risk, and improve regulation, technology, etc. and not discard our only solution we know of.
Humanity is not dumb with DNA manipulation at all. What makes you say that? Quite the opposite. GMO technology allowed us to produce 2-3x more food on the same land and feed billions. It saved humanity from starvation, and from further damage to lands, and from resource exhaustion like water, and from pesticide and fertiliser overuse. For the first time in history the land used for agriculture is shrinking thanks to GMO. Golden rice for example saves tens of thousands of kids every year from blinding A avitaminosis.

You're right. All of these events are interlinked. WW1 created the conditions for the great depression between 1930 and 1940, which caused the deflation of the $ for years. This increased the purchasing power of the dollar (pump). These events laid the foundation for the nazi propaganda. They blamed the Treaty of Versailles, which was partially true. The propaganda made WW2 possible.
So one could oversimplify and say WW1 made the $ pump, which made WW2.

No, you misunderstood.
I'm not talking about LN supporting 1 billion transactions. I'm talking about onboarding 1 billion people to LN, which needs to be done on chain. Realistically you need more than 1 on-chain transactions, but I gave the lower bound.
Realistically at this time, you need at least 4 transactions per person to on-board:
1. You need to receive bitcoin at least once to your bitcoin wallet
2. You need to create at least 2 channels on LN for spending bitcoin
3. Somebody needs to open at least 1 channel to you on LN for receiving capacity
Theoretically in the future all these 4 could be one larger bitcoin transaction, which is why I calculated with just one per person.
Or, more simply you could open a Bitcoin LN wallet with no outgoing capacity at all, and someone like your employer could open an incoming channel to you, sends you money on LN and you spend it hopping through your employer's LN node. Again a single transaction per person.

Also, 0-conf has been proven to be unsafe. Many have demonstrated that it can be abused on both BCH and BSV chains. One of the researchers: [
The rbf claim is BS, you can send a non-rbf transactions on Bitcoin too, which can be detected by the merchant, and thus it would be exactly the same 0-conf transaction as on BCH or BSV.
If 0-conf was safe, we wouldn't need blocks or mining. It's crazy that some people don't see this simple fact.

For the last 24 hours, we've had \~15,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. Low fee transactions are growing continously. It looks like somebody (or more entities) are made thousands of 7sat / byte or lower fee transactions that are not time sensitive.
@_date: 2019-02-09 16:20:58
Luke Dash Jr is primarily focused on reducing the size of the blockchain, and willing to compromise everything else for this goal. He’s correct with his views in the sense that if we lose full nodes the whole Bitcoin experiment is doomed. Bitcoin is valuable because it’s resistant to a potentially very hostile environment. However the number of nodes is growing, especially with LN, so there is no reason to panic. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 12:11:20
The most important element is that you don’t have to close channels for a long time. Any time you receive funds from anywhere, instead of just getting them to your wallet, you instead let the other party open a channel for you and send you the funds on LN instead. Thus with every bitcoin transaction more and more channels are opened between people and organizations, moving all active coins gradually to LN channels. Even if you want to move some coins back to on chain, you can use an exchange to turn LN coins to on-chain coins. The exchange sends bitcoins to your cold wallet directly. Zigzag already does this. Thus, you can maintain high incoming capacity on LN and have your coins in your cold wallet at the same time. 
So basically on-chain transactions will support LN onboarding and capacity increases, and high value on-chain transactions. All other transactions will be conducted in the highly connected and high capacity LN network.

I think Bitcoin can still handle about 1.4x increase in transactions as is. If many more used segwit addresses, especially bech32 (bc1...) addresses we can probably squeeze out 1.6x, but beyond that low fee transactions won't be mined.
Hopefully we will have Schnorr signatures soon. That will add another 25% potential capacity increase.

I agree that splicing is great and it will work as imagined.
Being online at least once in 2 weeks is not a problem. Most people are online all the time with their phone. However we do need continuous backups to make LN safe to use long term in case the phone breaks or lost. 
I think the best setup would be:
* savings are on-chain in cold wallet
* cold wallet backups hidden or in a safe
* hot LN wallet on phones for spending
* phone LN wallet backup + watchtower on private desktops or in private cloud accounts

It's true that many people buy it as investment, or store of value safe from the traditional systems, but there is also a bunch of other people who actually use it for payments.
Lots of freelancers use it to accept payments, lots of companies mostly in the tech sector use it to pay for advertising, many people use it to pay for services like phone topups, domains, hosting, etc. Many use it to gamble. Not just on-chain either. Bitcoin LN is the most used after Bitcoin and Ethereum on Bitrefill.
I use it around 2-3 times a month for various things. I have been paid and have paid others within the last 3 months. I use it more often than PayPal. Bitcoin is the 3rd most used payment method for me after debit and cash. I know people who use Bitcoin every other day.

Payment channels are just a special type of dApp or smart contract. I don't think you have the correct idea what a smart contract means. You're probably thinking smart contracts are the thing that Ethereum runs only. That's not the case.
Payment channels don't require trusted intermediaries. You can establish one with another bitcoin user directly, or hop through other users if you're not connected directly. Large trusted hubs are not necessary. In fact there is no need to trust anything even if you're hopping through large hubs, like a Coinbase or Amazon LN node. They can help facilitate more efficient routing, but they are not needed.

Every time the user base doubles the value of the network and thus its token (bitcoin) goes up 10x. Currently we have somewhere between 3-6M users. If we go to 6-12M we will see another bull run.
The difficulty is that there is no clear chart that shows user growth, because it depends how you define a user. Do you include a long term holder who never moves coins? Do you include a trader who doesn't hold any, but uses BTC frequently? Do you care about users who don't hold their own private keys? Etc.
However, you could look at some charts like these and judge for yourself if you see a growth trend in the last few years, and guess if it will continue or not:
My guess is our current 500,000 active addresses will grow to 1M by Jan 2021, which may not show on this chart because users move to LN and side chains (effectively not touching the main chain for long periods of time, so it will look like active addresses on main chain are stalling). By that time we will see a minimum of 10x growth in price. This doesn't mean the pump will not go up 10x or even 50x much earlier in anticipation of adoption.

@_date: 2019-02-17 15:23:19
Really cool ideas. I love the part where any on-chain payment instantly opens a channel and send the money over LN. Thus you have the funds on LN already when receiving. This way whenever there are no channels to route a payment on LN and money is sent on-chain it is an opportunity to open a new channel so next time there is no need to do the same, given the newly opened channel is bidirectionally balanced or the recipient spends the received funds elsewhere.

Well worded. Delaying 2x upgrade would be be wise at this point. The NYA companies should ask Core to develop a long term block size hard fork. Like x% yearly or dynamic increased based on blocksize history, etc. We should also include other improvements into this upgrade, like a cleanup of segwit that Core planned to do, and Shnorr signatures, giving us another 25% signature efficiency and transaction privacy. Test it all and then together upgrade.
There has to be a compromise from Core and NYA companies. Core has to understand that NYA companies want scaling to grow their businesses as fast as possible. And NYA companies have to understand that Core has their best interest and they have to trust them to do the right kind of scaling.
NYA companies, just integrate Segwit, so we have no fee pressure. I've seen 1.5MB blocks already with just ~10% segwit transactions. We can go up to 9000 transactions per block (which is like 3x)!

It's not an either or situation. It will lead to both outcomes and more, depending on personal situation and what the partners or merchants that the person wants to transact with are willing to accept. People needing to send crypto fast and cheaply will have three options:
* Pay for, and wait for channel opens on LN for Bitcoin
* Switch to one of the Bitcoin based side chains, like SBTC (Rootstock), or Liquid
* Sell their BTC for a fast alt with plenty of empty capacity to transact, like LTC, Doge, NANO, etc.
The question is what will grow faster to reach significant network effects: LN or one of the fast alts?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:58:37
Yes. But you can use a laptop with a regular internet connection and half a btc. Magnitudes cheaper than mining equipment.

Bitrefill offers a great service. LN works great on their platform. Customer service is excellent. Highly recommended.

Why should the funding be part of the challenge? If funding is part of it why not include the purchase of the cryptos too? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:51:18
Also, calculate the number of people 1MB block can serve if they only close and open once a year, which could happen once the infrastructure around LN is very robust.
~52K blocks a year
~100M transactions
~50M channels opened/closed (if that's all we use the blockchain for)
Thus, you can roughly serve a medium sized country like Canada or Germany with 1MB blocks. To serve the world we would need 140MB blocks. 100MB+ blocks are not too bad when we're talking about serving everyone.

It most definitely has intrinsic value.
You can think of bitcoins as trucks that are able to deliver value across the internet at light speed. You can also think of bitcoins as ultra-safe safety boxes that are able to store your wealth and can be accessed independently of your physical location. These are services that are essential and very useful in our highly digitised world.

@_date: 2019-02-05 03:48:46
Here is a guide:
* BTC 0.01 to learn about Bitcoin. Create wallets, recover wallets, send, receive, etc.
* BTC 0.1 to learn more, and to participate in the Bitcoin economy by trying out services that accept Bitcoin
* BTC 1 to invest moderately for very long term (think 10+ years), when 1BTC will be worth $100,000+. This is to ensure you're safe if Bitcoin manages to scale globally, and hyperbitcoinization happens.
* BTC 10 to invest aggressively for medium term (think 3-5 years). At this point BTC may be in $10,000-40,000 range, thus buying now will give you 3x-15x return. This will happen if multiple projects happen, including: base layer technical upgrades, second layer improvements, and adoption grows 2-3x thanks to various services.
* BTC 100 if you're already very rich and you don't really care about returns, but want to diversify your wealth to make sure you're safe if Bitcoin takes over any part of the fiat economy in a significant way. This way you stay rich in a Bitcoin dominated world in the years to come.

Which wallet allows you to open multiple channels with one transaction? That sounds pretty cool.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:20:52
Well, yes and no. You missed the boat to get in when it was super unsure if Bitcoin is going to work at all. If you put in $10K at that point, it could've very easily disappeared. There was a big upside, but the risks were very high too.
Now, we're in a different place. We can have much confidence that Bitcoin will work long term. We have a huge ecosystem, mining power, and tons of brain power behind Bitcoin. It's generally not a question of if, but when. The chance of it going to zero is now much smaller than ever before. You can still make 10-100x on Bitcoin at this point within a reasonable time (within a decade) if the adoption and development keeps going, and there is no reason why it shouldn't.
More importantly, it's not about making a huge profit, it's about safeguarding at least some of your savings against a possible hyperinflation or just accelerated depreciation of your fiat. People think they have to to escape fiat if it comes to that, but that's not true. The signs will be read by professionals earlier than anyone else, and within a few days or weeks fiat currencies can go into deep dive for no apparent reason. You can see how fast it happened with the Pound or the Rubble. People lost 30% of their value virtually overnight. If the event was more significant and long term, whatever fiat you're holding can loose 80% of its value within a week. In those scenarios Bitcoin will appreciate like crazy balancing your portfolio somewhat.
You're also buying to support Bitcoin's whole ecosystem. You're buying freedom for yourself and the world. It's much bigger than any one of us, or our little desires to become rich by investing in a high risk asset. It's about keeping our world safe from tyranny.

Bitpay needs to introduce segwit and then LN. If that happens I will give them business. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:40:07
Let’s see if it works!
@_date: 2019-02-22 09:08:01
Segwit adoption is only at 40%. We can reach 80% realistically in the next 12-18m. That would bring the max transaction capacity up by 15-25%, especially if more people used native segwit addresses (starting with bc1...) which is even more efficient than segwit. And then we will have Schnorr (if all goes well), adding another 25% on top of that. More batching by large entities can give us another 10%. So without raising the block size, we will have appr. 60% capacity increase available without compromising decentralisation. That will bring us over 5 tps.
After that, in 2021-2022, we can see how LN is doing, how bitcoin node count is doing, how expensive internet, CPU, storage, etc. are. The option to raise the blocksize is always there if there are no downsides to it, and the network can't operate without it. Currently that's not the case, but in the future (in 2022-2025), it may not be an issue run a full node with 2/4/8MB base + segwit, even if all blocks are nearly full, perhaps even on mobile devices.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:20:06

I think banks will not be buying bitcoin from us as the video suggests. They will be mining it for themselves, because that way they don't push the price up, which would be disadvantageous for them at the accumulation phase. When I see a major bank buying hydro or nuclear plants, I'm going 100% in.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:34:57
There is no ill will, don't make stuff up.
The developers were busy preparing for the forks. Hopefully now, they will be assigned to work on implementing segwit. Be patient folks. The bigger the business, the slower it is to implement new things. Too much organizational friction.
@_date: 2019-02-10 03:31:34
Yeah. It’s intentionally broken so to say to give the impression bitcoin’s too expensive.

**Marketing:** The more public full nodes there are the stronger Bitcoin seems to everyone (and it's not just a mirage), which translates to a higher price. So if you're an investor, the least you can do is run a full node to show public support. We want to see 50-100,000 public nodes here: [
**Safety:** On mobile you can run a modern wallet like BRD, which supports native segwit addresses and supports to run on your own node. All you have to do is provide the IP address of your own full node, and you can verify incoming transactions safely with your own copy of the blockchain. This ensures that you are fully validating all your transactions, even if you're using a mobile wallet. This way, you don't have to trust any other node to verify transactions for you. It provides the full and proper Bitcoin experience.
@_date: 2019-02-25 06:43:57
Halving is coming. If the demand remains the same or only drops a little in the next 500 days, the price will have to go up to accommodate for it.
The core properties of Bitcoin, and its network effects will likely lead Bitcoin to become a reserve currency of some sort, which will result in steady growth in price.
I don't recommend trading though, it's gamble. Just invest and stay put for years, maybe even a decade. You will likely not regret it.
@_date: 2019-02-01 15:23:41
It's optional.
When sending, you can send to any address from your wallet. If they accept bc1: great, you send to it with your bc1 supporting wallet, like BRD. If not, you can send with the same wallet to any other legacy format.
When receiving, if the service supports bc1 addresses, you generate a bc1 address and receive coins to it. If they don't, you can generate a legacy address, and receive to it.
The transition can be gradual and painless.
@_date: 2019-02-12 07:02:33
Don’t think so. They just launched proper native segwit address support on their wallet. They are surely more excited for Ethereum, but no an enemy of Bitcoin.

What if he did all this on purpose to save BTC from the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:30:55
The chance is exactly nil. If huge money that is able to manipulate markets was coming in, we would be at 25-40K, not 10K.
Ver bought in very early and thus had huge number of coins to try and crush BTC and it didn’t work. Now he’s out of coins to dump unless he wants to bet all in on his pet project, which would be extremely risky. And no other entity with malicious intents has 100K+ BTC which would be needed to make a significant downward push.
It would be like swimming against a tide. It’s much more lucrative to swim with the tide and cash out slowly at 20K, 30K and so on. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:38:42
True. But likely correlated. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:38:45
The idea is that we will use the bitcoin main chain as a settlement layer for second layer solutions like lightning network or Rootstock. You will open a channel once in a few month or so and then use the channel to process potentially millions of micro-transactions. 
Also, people have xmas lights on their houses wasting 2-3x the normal energy usage. We waste electricity in many ways that makes no sense. At least bitcoin transactions secures your money. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:22
It's speculation on the value of the token which will be used to run a big part of the world economy. Once second layer solutions are ready, humans and machines will exchange millions of micro-transactions every minute facilitating all kinds of existing and new businesses.
People are speculating that Bitcoin will be the blood of the digital economy in the near future. I'm assuming just 2-3 years in the future.

I think over $1,000 in value it is worth it to buy a $100 hardware wallet.
If you're planning for a paper wallet, you can do it for any small amount above $25 if you plan to hold long term.
If you only have $10 or less, don't do unnecessary transactions as the fees will into your holding.

@_date: 2017-11-10 02:38:58
I have three questions regarding LN:
1. Do you need to have a money transmitter license to operated a LN node, because you're moving money and collecting fees?
2. Can you theoretically have a channel open for indefinite time or do you need to settle occasionally?
3. How do you know in advance if the person you're trying to send money to is connected to you on LN on the channel you're on?
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:00:44
Let's for a second assume POS is solved and it is as safe as POW.
I think POS is better from an environmental standpoint, but it's worse from an economic standpoint. In decentralization it's important to have different players to be part of an ecosystem. Users, holders, miners, developers, corporations, node operators, etc. all have different incentives balancing each other out to create a stable economy. It creates an environment where you can't really use game theory to game the system. Also, miners only really earn 5-10% of the coins they mined, the rest needs to be sold to cover costs, which leads to a more distributed coin.
Once you removed the miners, the game is becoming much simpler and thus more dangerous. Rich holders will be earning the most coins, and become exponentially more powerful over time. Unavoidably at one point the largest 2-3 holders can collude to change the algo to make themselves even richer or give themselves special privileges like veto nodes, etc. Because they have the power to crash the system, smaller coin holders will be trapped and will suffer from Stockholm syndrome. :)
I think the solution is not POW, but moving energy production to green sources, like Thorium nuclear, and next generation solar.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:04:30
Actually the fees were worse recently:

If you can't invest in Bitcoin now for any reason, here is a better thing you CAN do and it doesn't cost any money. Get books on Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general and start learning about the technology. Learn the fundamental math behind it, learn bitcoin tech, learn a smart contract language like Solidity.
There is already an insane demand for people who can do crypto currency applications Today, and the demand will grow with the price. Try to get to a level where you can contribute to the Bitcoin project actively, so you can demonstrate to a future employer your abilities. Or, if you have an entrepreneurial spirit, you will be able to start your own crypto project.
Any time and effort you invest into being marketable as a programmer, product manager, etc. in this space will pay handsomely for you in the near future. It's even better than investing into the currency itself.
If your Mom gives you some money, spend it on courses, and books, not Bitcoin. Good luck!

* Greyscale / yellow understated colour scheme

* No trading between alts and Bitcoin built in
* You can't buy Bitcoin from the wallet directly

@_date: 2017-11-23 20:05:44
LN is cool because it will allow BTC holders make money on their coins by locking up the bitcoins in channels and collecting fees. BTC will be part POW securing the base layer and part POS securing second and third layers. This will incentivize people to buy BTC and thus drive the price up and by doing this incentivize miners to invest more in mining hardware.

The weak hands got out weeks ago when BTC was dropping and BCH was rising. Now they are watching BTC grow empty handed. When the correction comes in about 10 days (christmas spending + 10% difficulty increase causing mempool backlog), there will be fewer people who panic sell and plenty of people trying to get back into BTC. 
It will take few more months to build up enough weak hands to cause a significant correction. By significant I mean -25% or more. The level of this correction will depend on 5 factors in order of importance:
* ETF status
* Coinbase support level of BCH (withdraw only or full support)
* Segwit adoption levels
* Ligtning Network launching on main net
* Rootstock launching on main net

Don’t forget that BTC will essentially becomes partially POS like ETH.
Bitcoin holders will be able to run lightning nodes and lock up their funds to open channels for other people to go through and collect fees. The more BTC you have the bigger the transaction you can process and more fees you can collect.
If you don’t want the hassle of running your own node, there probably will be companies that run it for you and you just pay them a fee for collecting lightning fees on your behalf. You just provide the liquidity.

Yes. Especially for large sums. It is not cost efficient to send $10 with bitcoin right now because you pay a $2 fee on top, but sending $1000 makes sense. 
Once we have Rootstock and Lightning Network sending even 0.01 dollars will be cost efficient. Watch this space in 3 months. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:51:21
Segwit is already working. The adoption can be seen here:  (click since activation option). The spike a few weeks ago was probably companies testing integration.
Besides LN, there is also Rootstock project that will do two things for bitcoin. It will introduce a currency called RSK, which will be pegged to Bitcoin, and can be used for small value quick transactions, for example for micropayments. You will be able to go back and force between RSK and BTC without an exchange. It doesn't dilute BTC, because you have to lock up BTC in order to generate RSK, and you destroy RSK to unlock the BTC. Besides RSK serving as an off chain bitcoin transaction it will also allow smart contracts like on Ethereum, so people can start ICOs on Rootstock, backed by BTC, without inflating the Bitcoin blockchain.
There is also Shnorr signatures, which will bring partially confidential transactions, and 25% capacity increase to Bitcoin.
There are other projects, one will bring confidential transactions to BTC, and another that completely changes how the blockchain is stored in an extremely efficient way, and how bitcoin is mined called mimbewimble, but it may not replace bitcoin's code, rather work as a sidechain similar to how RSK works. This is very broad strokes though. :)

No, you wouldn't be trusting anybody even if the 5 big hubs scenario materialized. You would be able to unilaterally close a channel at any point. And they can't steal your channel coins in any way.
Also, it's very unlikely that hubs will rule the system. There will be thousands of mini hubs and tens of thousands of micro hubs all competing for your routing fees.
Think of it like the internet, where we have a coupe of major players, like Google, Netflix, etc., but there are millions of independent players too routing packets.
Potentially all hodlers will run lightning routing nodes themselves or lend our their coins (with a smart contract) to LN node operators who will be paid a fee from the fees you collect using your hodler coins.

@_date: 2019-02-05 04:45:15
He keeps stressing that he's convinced only one chain will survive. Let's assume that's true. What are the chances BSV will be the one? It has very little traction, virtually no transactions, price/market cap is low, mining power is very low. There are at least 8 coins that are stronger than BSV right now, and there are dozens trying to overtake it from below. (I don't count XRP and Stellar as crypto for obvious reasons.) The chance of BSV making it to be the only surviving blockchain is very close to zero at this point.
Other than that, I welcome his experiments. I think it's great to test mega large blocks, it's great to test the hypothetical business uses cases. If any of it works, we can bring it to Bitcoin relatively easily because BSV is a distant fork of BTC, and thus shares the foundations.

I think most Bitcoiners understand the need for a delicate balance. Stability and not forking unless there is consensus and great need is one of the main benefits of Bitcoin. It provides long term stability, predictability, and security. On the other hand, we don't want to create a situation where network growth is limited either, because that would defeat the goal of Bitcoin be able to serve the world eventually.

If I understand correctly you will be able to exchange one to the other at any time on the Rootstock blockchain.
However RSK will also be on exchanges. The value may be slightly different from Bitcoin, because RSK tokens will be easier and cheaper to send, but on the other hand they are not true bitcoin and thus there will be less trust. The market will decide.
This will be a similar situation to Tether and USD. It's not exactly 1:1 at all times, but mostly it is. However RSK will be better than Tether, because people won't have to trust a third party to exchange the token for USD, or in RSK's case RSK to BTC.

Ah, the 1% fallacy.
It sounds little a reasonable, but in reality going from 0 to 1 is as hard or harder than going from 1 to 10.
To get to 1% you need to go through multiple 10x increments, like 0.00001 &gt; 0.0001 &gt; 0.001 &gt; 0.01 &gt; 0.1 &gt; 1.
Currently we're in the 0.001 &gt; 0.01 phase.

In my opinion it’s safe to buy any time before the Lightning Network hits the mainnet. At that point BTC will become a means of generating profit through locking it up in channels and collecting fees. There will be huge demand for BTC.

3. Implement 3 layer between BTC and LN - Work in progress
4. Increase block size gradually and continuously, not in a single jump
Not necessarily in the order I listed.
This way we CAN handle VISA level transaction sizes in 5-10 years in a decentralized way, so it's not a VISA 2.0.
BCH can have 8MB blocks, it's not a problem for them, because the blocks are 95% empty anyway, but for Bitcoin they would be full in no time and the decentralization would start dropping, undermining the core value.

POW = Proof of Work - To mine coins you have to use electricity to run computers solving puzzles. New coins are given to miners. This is what Bitcoin uses, and most other cryptos too.

It is actually unlikely that we will have a few massive hubs locking up tens of thousands of coins. It’s more likely that we will have all sizes of channel operators including people running lightning nodes at home collecting fees.
The reason is that the barrier to entry to this business is very low. All you need is a computer, an internet connection and some bitcoin. It will be profitable for hodlers to operate lightning nodes, bitcoin becomes partly proof of stake. Large players like exchanges will get in on the game too, but they won’t be the only ones.
Routing software will take into consideration the channel with the lowest fees, so small players can outbid big organizations, because they don’t need to make budget. It is just a side gig running in the background on unused internet bandwidth, like a paid for sharing torrent app.
It will be less like mining with a few pools and no solo miners, and more like the internet webservers where we have hosting companies of all sizes, tens of thousands of them distributed all over including people running small web servers at home.

Indeed people are born and groom themselves to be different and talking about their features is not a problem. It is only a problem when you have prejudices based on their appearance, or age, etc. which you continuously do.
To answer the above quote from you, lots of white males struggle because they were born with health problems, are orphans, were abused, come from extreme poverty, etc. Nowadays, because of prejudices and misinterpretation of diversity concepts white males are less desired at workplaces, even if they are of equal or better than other candidates. Workplaces fill quotas based on appearance, religion, etc. This is done with good intention, but the end result is disastrous and antithetical to the goal.
We categorize and simplify the world all the time. This ability has served us well for hundreds of thousands of years. But if we take equality seriously we have to actively and consciously fight the urge to categorize people based on past experiences, and we should give every single person the same welcome free of any prejudices. This will serve everyone well on the long term.

I think sidechains are the solution.
I envision a system which makes one on chain transaction every \~10 mins, consolidating millions of off-chain payments in a provable manner.
All off-chain transactions would be extremely cheap and instantaneous, have less trust level than on chain transactions, but more than zero confirmation transactions on the base chain. When the on-chain transaction is made by the sidechain to Bitcoin base chain, it would make all the transactions on the sidechain irreversible. Both payer and payee have to trust the sidechain until the confirmation happens, but since there is an incentive for the sidechain to be trusted on the long term and make millions, they will not steal your few hundred dollars. This way we can keep the bitcoin blockchain small so anyone can verify it and secure it, but we will also have super fast sidechains that can serve your everyday spending needs.
There could be multiple such sidechains similarly to VISA, MC and Amex, and they would compete for users with their ease of use and lack of issues. They could serve slightly different use cases or audiences making tradeoffs in different ways. Some would offer payment streaming for Netflix like services, so you pay by the minute for watching stuff, others may offer high maximum payment limits, etc. Some of them could even offer short term credit to long term users, and offer other advanced banking features. Users would choose from these new banks that are built on top of the decentralized Bitcoin, and use multiple as needed.
Essentially, what I describe is a bit like Coinbase payments between accounts, but imagine that the whole Coinbase ledger is consolidated and timestamped every 10 minutes on the Bitcoin blockchain chain, so anyone can monitor that Coinbase is honest, and force Coinbase not be able to revert any payments once made, unless they are willing to take the hit themselves. It's also a bit like LN, but imagine all channels are closed and re-opened with new balances every 10 minute with one giant consolidated transaction.

Agreed. We should not forget that the Bitcoin community needs companies to serve the diverse needs of users. And businesses are only interested if there is an ever growing user base they can make money off. And growing the userbase is in everybody's interest anyway, because it makes the ecosystem more robust, and bitcoin itself valued higher.

Title isn't correct. The average is not 1.3MB yet.
Segwit adoption has been stalling and even slightly declining since October 2018. We need more larger players starting to use it, like Gemini, Bitpay, etc. [
However, transactions per day are growing and are now on the same level as it was around October and November (\~330,000/day), yet the fees have stayed low. It will be interesting to see what happens when we're in the \~400,000/day territory like in December 2018 and January 2019. My expectation is that fees will remain acceptably low, and the fee pressure will only manifest itself at around \~450,000/day. Hopefully that's still at least 5-6 months away, and by then a few more larger players adopt segwit, so the fees can remain low.
Once we reach 75% segwit adoption rate, I think we won't be able to grow further, or grow really slow. Let's hope in 12-18m we get Schnorr signatures, which gives us significant savings so we can push beyond \~550,000/day without fees growing high.
In 24m hopefully LN's technical and UX issues have been resolved, and major adoption of LN can take place with hundreds of thousands of full LN nodes, and millions of users.

If everybody expect others to dump at $100K, some will try to outsmart them and dump at 90K, some others will try to outsmart the 90K people and dump at 80K, some conservatives will at 70K, and bears at 60K, 50K, 40K, 30K, 20K. We end up people dumping and buying at all price points leaving much less coins available to sell at 100K then we expected. Thus, the price may just shoot through 100K all the way to 250K leaving sellers sub 100K bitter.
People who were happy selling their random coin at $8, were utterly depressed when they saw $80. And people who were euphoric selling at $80 were utterly pissed seeing some others exiting at $1200. Later, people who were buying in at $1200, thinking it's going to $10K killed themselves (sometimes literally) when the price went back to $200.
If you are in crypto trading long enough, you witnessed such events many times before. Trying to buy and sell to make a quick profit on short term is gambling, and the exchanges are acting as casinos for the players. Gambling is as dangerous to your mental and physical health as hard drugs. Don't do it, unless you're a trained professional, or you will wreck yourself. Be wise and reasonable, and accept the reality that it's impossible to time the market perfectly, no matter how tempting it may seem.
All you can do is: buy when you can regardless of price cost averaging and go long. Cut back on non-essential spending and invest instead. Don't sell unless you have an urgent need. You won't miss the bullshit you didn't buy, instead you will have the enjoyment watching your assets grow over time. You will miss both high and low extremes, instead you will build your capital over long time until the crypto investment becomes life changing.

They could do it if they don’t accept instant payments with btc, but funding accounts with btc. That way if the transaction takes long no problem. I fund my account today and spend it over the next weeks.
For instant payments we need LN first, which would essentially be the same thing. You lock your bitcoin in a channel in advance and then pay instantly on channel when needed. 
Potentially Amazon could become one of the biggest channel operators because it would have channels open to so many people. As soon as you spend with Amazon once, any other person connected to them will be able to send you bitcoins hopping through Amazon.

'Attack' is an emotionally loaded word designed to make the fork look evil and threatening. It's not an attack, forks are part of Bitcoin's design. If it's not a good idea, people won't go with it, and won't buy the new token, thus miners won't mine it. End of story. It will fork off as an altcoin.
Why is it not a good idea? Because it's a one off solution instead of a long term solution. People running their own nodes to verify transactions is a critical function of bitcoin, because that's the only way the network can maintain concensus. If the blockchain grows too fast doing so becomes less and less possible, thus the core feature of Bitcoin will be eroded. We already have segwit which allows for a theoretical 3x block size increase if people and businesses were to use segwit addresses. We have had 1.3MB ~ 1.5MB blocks already with just 10% segwit transactions. We can easily reach 2MB blocks reducing fees and increasing transaction capacity. To add a 2x block size increase on top is becoming risky even if it means we're artificially limiting the number of transactions the network can handle for now.
A good way to go about this problem and to increase transactions capacity on Bitcoin would be:
* Implementing segwit everywhere possible: 200-300% capacity increase - This is possible Today.
* Implementing lightning network. This locks up funds and requires two transactions to open and close channels occasionally, but brings about off chain scaling, meaning the core of Bitcoin's decentralization won't be threatened, yet we get instantly confirming transactions and 100,000% + capacity increase. This is possible Today.
* Shnorr signatures adds another 25% capacity increase + confidential transactions - Requires hard fork.
* Gradual or dynamic block size increase: Ex. 10-20% per year, or dynamic based on the last 10,000 blocks capped at 50% - Requires hard fork.
@_date: 2019-12-09 02:48:21
It's very high capacity connecting two highly connected nodes. Makes sending high value transactions more reliable for everyone: [
It's the highest capacity channel to date on LN at $15,000. The second highest channel is between Bitrefill and Acinq at BTC 1.8. Third is between Opennode and Bluewallet at BTC 1.67.

It’s more energy intensive to not have proof of work to achieve the value bitcoin provides. 
Developers are working on effective and secure proof of stake algorithms, but none have been successful so far. They all rely on some form of trusted third party. 
However, we will achieve several magnitudes more transactions without increasing the mining once we introduce the lightning network. At that point the mining energy expenditures per transaction will fall by 1000 or 1M fold.

Yes. Doubling takes more and more time. Eventually it will plateau. All this depends on whether lightning network can deliver or if core comes up with a sustainable on chain scaling option. Otherwise Ether or another coin will grow at the same speed instead of bitcoin.

Fundamentally gold is made of gold atoms that are mostly just empty space with a few subatomic particles like electrons, protons and neutrons that make up all other elements too. Gold is just an arrangement of subatomic particles which represent value because we agreed it would. 
Bitcoin is the same. We have electrons arranged in a particular order to represent value.
Fundamentally the same. The difference is you can send the arrangement representing bitcoin over wires, but you can’t send the arrangement representing gold through wires. In the age of information which one is more valuable?

I think r/btc deserves a bit of celebration. They have been on the losing side for so long. I think bitcoin will come out stronger after these events, like it has in the past over and over. If a bigger blocksize would be a reason for people to switch, we had litecoin for many years. Litecoin is more functional than Cash because it generates blocks more often. But at the end it's the core properties that matter. Level of decentralization, large and competent developers, acceptance, and trust by people.
However, we do need to scale bitcoin as we want more people to be able to use it. Segwit adoption is happening, but it's slow. Having a small 15% per year block increase or similar would be reasonable.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:33:18

Yeah, that will have to wait a few more months though. Right now Bitcoin can't handle that many transactions on chain. Once LN and RSK start we can onboard hundreds of millions. Once layers between Bitcoin and LN start working, we can serve billions. But these developments are at least a year away.

The disadvantages of a larger block size won’t manifest themselves until there is an 8MB block created every 10 minutes, which would mean Bitcoin Cash is wildly successful. Until then Cash will simply enjoy the cheap fees and no disadvantages. However, the problem of Cash is: if it’s about low fees and fast transactions there are many better coins out there that would easily outcompete Cash. Litecoin is older, faster, and has more features to start with. Cash has zero benefits over litecoin, monero, dash and literally dozens of other alts. Even for speculation, for the long term people will likely gain more holding feature rich coins like ethereum or zcash, if they wanted a hedge for their btc. There is literally no benefit adopting it.
The only chance they had is to take the bitcoin brand name, however that ship has sailed long time ago. No serious or sizeable industry player calls or considers Cash to be Bitcoin. And the more services introduce Cash alongside Bitcoin, the less chance there is it will ever be considered more than an alt like Bitcore, Byteball, Bitcoin Gold and many other airdropped coins. Every single day that went, by the more firmly Cash has been cemented in everybody’s mind as an alt. At this time it is fraudulent to claim that Cash is Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Cash exists solely to support the asic boosted mining operations.

1. Talk is cheap. Show me the money! Employers will easily give you titles and praises, but when it comes to bonuses and raises they are frugal. For a moral person, hard work is one of the most important things in life, that gives it meaning. People derive joy and self worth from it. Money is a physical representation of this hard joyful labour frozen in time. This is what Ayn means by money being a foundation of moral existence. It's important to understand that 'work' can be any type of activity that requires brain and muscle power and transforms the world into a better place. This can be the work of an artist, the work of a mother with their children, can be the work of a volunteer at an adult day care center, etc. And even though those examples are not necessarily appreciated with money, they are included in the idea regardless. Money is just used an approximation because most work is compensated.
2. Gold has an objective value because it took hard work to unearth it and thus it has 'proof of work frozen into it'. This is in contrast with paper money which has very little 'proof or work' behind it, because you can virtually print endless amounts of it with very little effort.
Hope this help clarify these ideas.

There are multiple projects happening, all relatively close to completion:
1. Segwit has already been activated and will give Bitcoin ~2x capacity increase as adoption for this new type of wallet and addresses grows. You can track the adoption rate here:  Once we reach 50+% we would have an effective doubling of transaction capacity.
2. Shnorr signatures. This basically combines multiple signatures into one, compressing the transaction sizes potentially by a large degree, especially if you lots of smaller ones coming in. Capacity increase is roughly ~25%+, in addition this will increase privacy. This can be implemented via soft fork.
3. Lightning Network is a second layer solution that will basically create an 'internet of payments'. It will allow organizations and individuals create payment hubs and channels which will find a route between sender and receiver like an email. This will increase transaction capacity 1000x, but it will require people to lock up their bitcoins in channels. On the plus side it will allow instant and virtually free transactions (no miner fees). This will free up on-chain capacity a lot because there are certain users who use the blockchain heavily with dozens of hundreds of transactions a day. These would all be moved to this second layer for speed and efficiency. This will come out later this year, but likely will take another year to materialize for a significant portion of users.
4. Rootstock is another second layer solution. It's basically a clone of Ethereum, that will be pegged to bitcoin. Rootstock will be able to have Ethereum level scaling (and smart contracts) promised to be ~2000 tx/second. This second level chain could serve as a checking or debit account for Bitcoin users, while the regular bitcoin will serve as their savings account. Rootstock has been promised to come out by the end of the year as well.
There are more projects, but I don't know enough about them to describe them. I hope somebody else can help me out...
*edit: corrected segwit ~3x to ~2x capacity increase, as realistically we will only achieve between 1.7x and 2.2x with 100% segwit adoption.*

Number of nodes is the not the bottleneck for LN adoption. Base layer transaction capacity is because you need to create LN wallets with channels.
Theoretically you can open 10 channels with one transaction, so theoretically we can onboard 400,000 entities to LN in one day. In practice much less, because LN is just one of many uses of Bitcoin. Still, if LN really works well at large scales, and is widely used and accepted, which I think has a high chance of happening, we can easily onboard at least a million people to LN every week.
In a year we can onboard 50-60 million people. That's the size of a nation like the UK. Let's just hope we can reach this kind of capacity limit! It would mean the user base grew 10x.
However, all speculation goes out of the window at this adoption rate, because at every 2x user growth, we grew 10x in Bitcoin price. When we have tens of millions of Bitcoin users, the price will be astronomically high, which changes everything. I don't know what happens to the Bitcoin ecosystem when 1 BTC is closing in on US$1,000,000. Nobody can predict the events to unfold. One thing is for sure, we're in for an exciting ride.

There are two factors that should be kept in mind when you look at this chart:
* Those pools are made of many individual miners who can move their mining power relatively easily to other pools. Not all pools are made of many entities, but most are.
* Some of those pools are owned by the same entity, but named differently (or unknown) to give the appearance of decentralisation, when in fact to an extent they control a large portion of mining.

Yeah. Uncertainty removed. Price may go up. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:19:50
Actually, that's not correct.
The 'official' (as official as it gets) roadmap signed years ago by many prominent Bitcoin developers (incl. the extreme small blocker Luke jr.) includes a moderate blocksize increase when safe to do so in steps of 2, 4, 8MB base block size. Safe is defined as not threatening node count, which means technology has been accelerating faster than the blockchain grows. So far that plan that has been put forward has been followed precisely.
The next step after Segwit is Schnorr sigs soft fork and, only after that we're ready for a block size soft or hard fork. Since both Segwit and Schnorr increase the number of transactions that can fit into the base block size, any block size increase will be much more effective and thus less contentious to implement. This is a prudent way to do things, because Bitcoin developers want to exhaust all the available options to optimize the current blocksize before recklessly increasing it and thus threatening the biggest value Bitcoin has, its decentralization level.

It's not a huge deal, but it's still big. Lots of people know about it, so the current price partially already reflects the halvening. And not just the one that is happening in 2020, also to some extent the one after in 2024, and to a tiny extent the one in 2028.
In my view, the halvening will bring a small price move up 1-6 month before the event in anticipation. Then right after the event the price will retract as people realize that apparently not much has changed. Miners will still be selling the bitcoins mined earlier for a while. However, the squeeze on bitcoins available to the market will start taking an effect 2-3 months after the halvening event, and at this time the price movement up will be sustained longer and result in bigger gains to meet the market demand.
Litecoin will have halvening sooner in about 6 months, and it already had a pump pushing it ahead of most altcoins. [
Another interesting thing is that it looks like BCH will have its halving happen a month or so before Bitcoin (because Bitmain fast mined a ton of BCH coins after the fork when the difficulty adjustment went crazy), which may create a small pump for BCH a bit earlier than Bitcoin. On the other hand, there will be a period when the mining reward on BCH already dropped to half, while Bitcoin is still on the same level, and thus it will be extremely unprofitable to mine BCH. Currently BCH maintains around 3% of mining power, so to remain profitable the power has to drop to 1.5%. This is dangerously low. The only chance BCH have here is if Bitmain and Ver are willing to mine for 6-8 weeks at a huge loss to protect the chain, which they did during the BCH SV fork. However, this time it may be different. If on top of the reward halving a wealthy individual or a small pool, like Craig W. joins in to attack BCH (to make profit by shorting or some other way) at the same time, the cost of protecting the chain may be too high and either Ver or Bitmain may give up. Because people know about the possibility of such a collapse, the process of BCH losing value could start way before the halving event, making the attack more and more likely and the likelyhood of BCH bagholders giving up also bigger and bigger. Another strategy to protect BCH would be to somehow mine Bitcoin faster reducing the time between BCH's and Bitcoin's halving event, but that's super hard to pull off.

Ayn Rand was a visionary, and as it always goes with novel and deep ideas, her work is not appreciated by most of her contemporaries as it's too inconvenient to accept even though it's truthful. In Today's society, collectivism and the lack of appreciation for hard work is the norm. In the future her ideology will be appreciated much more, but before that the current world view has to experience a major crisis.
Also, one has to understand that the expression of her ideas are dated, because she was bound by her age's technological development. You have to look beyond worlds like 'gold' and many other things which are old school, and consider them only as metaphors for the deeper ideas. When she says 'gold', it's not about the actual metal, it's about the fact that it's an instrument that is independent of any central authority, and has limited supply. If Ayn Rand was alive Today, she would love Bitcoin, because it embodies very closely the ideal of honest money.

What control? They won't gain any control even if miners and users embraced 2X, and called it Bitcoin. Such an event doesn't guarantee that users will embrace future forks as well. Just like Core doesn't hold anyone hostage by them running Core software now, 2X won't hold anyone hostage either.
I'm unsure what is there to gain for NYA companies, other than the actual blocksize increase they believe in.
@_date: 2019-02-11 07:45:16
Some of the Bitcoin forks died (ex. Bitcoin God), but dozens are technically still surviving, because they have miners, working wallets, merchants and people who are willing to take is payments, and are listed on exchanges.
*Fun fact: Did you know, there is even is a Bitcoin Core coin, with 1 minute block time* [* Weird huh!?*
BCH will survive for years to come, because there is a relatively small but passionate (partially fuelled by misplaced hate of Bitcoin) community behind it, and there are two very rich major bagholders (Mr. Ver and Bitmain) who own a large percentage of all the BCH coins (which is a risk in itself). They keep buying their own coin to keep the price afloat as much as possible.
At the very beginning of the fork BCH had the same theoretical number of users as Bitcoin, so they had a chance to make it because they had users. Soon after bitcoin supporters started selling their BCH coins, all of which got consolidated in those mentioned few hands. These folks are buying BCH because they believe it will one day worth more than Bitcoin, but in reality what they are doing is essentially getting rid of their users, but it's the best they can do in this situation. The further we get from the fork, the less this user based initial potential matters. So time is working against BCH, while time is working for Bitcoin.
BCH is also squeezed on multiple other fronts by many competitors:
* **Brand** \- Bitcoin, the biggest and most important coin commands the Bitcoin brand name, so at best BCH is seen like a literally cheap copycat that is trying to scam people by using a similar brand name. Bitcoin also has tons of exciting developments, including base layer improvements, second layer projects, and sidechains, all making Bitcoin better and more widely used in various contexts. So, there is no chance in hell BCH will ever be considered Bitcoin by people at large.
* **Original Vision** \- BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) has successfully claimed BCH's brand promise being 'the original Satoshi's vision'. And frankly by BSV returning the code to be more closer to the original code, it actually fulfils the promise better, if somebody buys into this ideology.
* **Big Blocks** \- BSV also successfully claimed BCH's other brand promise which is bigger blocks, because BSV has even bigger blocks and thus if this was the right path forward to scaling: BSV wins. BSV also claimed all the most hard core big blockers splitting the BCH community.
* **Faster** \- BCH also promotes 0-conf combined with big blocks providing faster transactions. This claim is by default nonsense, because you can send non-RBF 0-conf transactions on Bitcoin which makes it an equivalent to BCH's 0-conf, but beyond that Bitcoin LN transactions are also nearly instantaneous and safer than 0-conf, and thus much better for merchant transactions. But let's set aside Bitcoin for a moment. There are literally dozens of altcoins with larger userbases and more daily transactions than BCH that offer faster block times: LTC at 2.5m, Doge at 1m, ETH at 15 seconds. So, if on-chain speed was the winning feature, BCH with 10 mins is losing.
* **Cheaper** \- BCH promotes that the transactions are cheaper. Again, here BCH faces lots of competition that blows it out of the water. Bitcoin LN is way cheaper, but let's put Bitcoin aside again. Dash, BTG, BSV, etc. offer even cheaper transactions on-chain, and there are coins like NANO that have zero fees. It's going to be hard to compete against zero. So, again a claim that BCH won't be able to win. Also, it's going to be interesting to see what happens with BCH blockchain in 1.5 years when the reward halves, and in 5.5 years when it does again, making the block reward really small, and no fees to support mining. At the same time Bitcoin will already have started replacing the block reward with fee rewards to an extent. The competition for miners will squeeze BCH considerably.
* **Merchant adoption** \- Because of Bitpay which accepts only Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, BCH has lots of potential merchants accepting it, but based on the BCH daily transaction volume, it doesn't look like there is much traction here. Also, in most physical stores if any crypto is accepted it's either just Bitcoin, or the typical trio of: "BTC, ETH, LTC". I never seen BCH accepted in real life anywhere, it must be very rare. I have seen XRP and Dash once each. Also, the relevance of Bitpay seems to be shrinking with many competitors that accept all kinds of alts like Coingate, so this edge BCH has over other alts is disappearing.
In conclusion, I think having all these forks and alts in general is good for Bitcoin, because they test technologies and economic theories for Bitcoin. If any works out, Bitcoin can adopt them and deploy them having all the learning that was done on other chains, without risking the main chain. This has been done before, when a Bitcoin's Segwit initiative was first deployed on Litecoin, which helped give confidence to later deploy on Bitcoin too.

I mean it's possible, but it won't arise from Lightning Network or Bitcoin, because the is code simple and doesn't include any machine learning element at this point.
What could happen though are two things:
* An independent AI running somewhere else uses Bitcoin and LN to trade or use it to exchange value, etc.
* In a future version of LN, we may have machine learning that optimizes routing, which is the smarts to find the best path between two users to send the value. That machine learning could theoretically act as an AI that takes on a life of its of own. But this is highly speculative.

RBF was implemented in an opt-in way. If you don't send the transaction with RBF enabled, the transaction can't be bumped up with a fee. Thus, if a merchant only trusts non-RBF transactions for zero conf, then it's available.

It will confirm, don't worry. We're eating up the 5-10 sat levels now. Soon yours may get into a block: 
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:30:05
The idea is that Schnorr will be introduced within a year (hopefully). It will compact multiple input transaction signature sizes, which means we can fit maybe 30-40% more transactions into a block, without increasing the block size. If we can hold out until then, it would be great.
If all goes well, bigger native Segwit address adoption (bc1...) in the next 12 month will give us the chance to keep fees reasonable until Schnorr is introduced.
Then, any subsequent block size increase will give us much more transactions, because the multiplier is larger with Schnorr and Segwit in place. Thus, for example if an extra 0.1MB base block would give us 100,000 transactions per day Today, after bc1 being widely used and Schnorr introduced, the very same 0.1MB would give us \~160,000.
This careful approach will hopefully be the right balance between keeping the blockchain small, yet increase the transaction capacity, and get Bitcoin ready for a modest blocksize increase to serve sidechains and second layers well, so adoption can increase without sacrificing any of the core values of the network, which makes it valuable and worth transacting on in the first place.

No, quite the opposite.
Centralization would be if there were less channels, but with higher capacities. That's not what's happening.
Instead, we are getting more channels with higher capacities between more entities. This is decreasing centralization. The scenario with the new high capacity channel includes all the prior decentralization properties and more.

@_date: 2017-11-14 21:28:24
Yeah, probably 2-8MB will not kill centralization, but it's already thin. We need millions of nodes, not just hundreds of thousands. If we start losing nodes just at 5-10% a year rate, very soon we will end up with virtually no decentralization. Having said that, there aren't many transactions on BCH, so it would be working just as well on 1MB. The 8MB is unnecessary right now, and by the time it would be necessary (in 3-5 years), the block size won't matter because 2nd and 3rd layer solutions will be widely used.

You can't claim such a thing without any backing. It's an ad hominem fallacy.
How was she a hypocrite? I'm quite sure you have no good proof for this, just some misunderstanding of what she stands for, and / or how her ideas should manifest themselves into actions in real life.
For example, often she's criticised that she took government healthcare at her old age, even though she was against socialised medicine. This looks hypocritical on the surface, but in reality it is not. In her writing she explained that in a society where you're bound by unfair rules, it's morally acceptable to take back some of the wealth taken from you by force to make up for the 'theft' at least a little.
To explain the concept here is a deliberately extreme situation. Imagine you're kidnapped and you're locked up in a cage by your captor. The captor owns the cage, and the keys to the cage. In a limited interpretation of what moral means, you're not to steal the keys to the cage as they are not your property. Yet, everyone would agree that taking back your freedom even if it means you have to steal the key is fair game. It's the moral thing to do against an aggressor, and it's not an equivalent action to stealing the key of your neighbour's garage. In a similar fashion, Ayn Rand considered taxation 'theft' enforced by the state, and thus taking back some of that stolen wealth through medical services is fair game. You can take back some of the stolen value, and hold the ideas that taxation is theft and caging people is a crime at the same time without contradiction. This is not a hypocrisy. Sometimes you have to dig deeper before making a swift judgement.
Even if she can be proven to be hypocrite in one or few of her actions, that doesn't render her ideas invalid. Do you live up to your own ideals every day of your life with perfection? Nobody can or does. Neither did she. She must have had weak or unclear moments due to sickness or old age. It's a fallacy to dismiss an idea based on such exceptions. By this standard no ideas should be taken seriously.

It's funny to read these critiques, because objectivism is quite the opposite of emotionally stunted, crippled, etc. typically written by pseudo intellectuals, who are threatened by her ideology deeply rooted in realism, as opposed to the collectivist fantasies these 'intellectuals' kindle, especially in their early years of careers.
Ayn's writing can only be understood and appreciated in your late adulthood years when you already have at least a few decades of life experience, so you can relate to how long term relationships form between humans, and especially between individuals and the state. When you are young, you can only appreciate some of the more superficial ideas.
It is often brought up that her heroes are unbelievable. They are indeed not common people, and that's the very idea. These are characters that are exaggerated and larger than life to demonstrate the ideas of objectivism. These people DO exist in real life, but you may need a few decades of life experience to come across them. When you do, you will remember them forever.
Unable to deal with the real world? If by that they mean unable to bend to the corrupt world, then the statement is correct. But, otherwise in general terms objectivist heroes and followers of objectivism, and other similar philosophies strive to actually face the real world much more than the average Joe does. They are more grown up than the critics who delude themselves forever by replacing caretakers, with the idea of the government or church, in order to stay in a state of perpetual childhood.

You're right in some respects. But gold does have 'proof of work' behind it. It's hard to find and mine it. Similar to Bitcoin.
Nothing has inherent value, not even food or oxygen. As you rightly pointed out it all depends on the observer. If you have tons of free oxygen around you, you will not pay for oxygen. But if you have none, you will give virtually everything for it, or you literally pay with your life. Even in case of the starving man on a deserted island, gold may be more valuable than food, depending on the circumstances. What if he finds a working radio that is missing a wire to connect the battery to it. He will surely choose a gold wire over a big mac because he can return to civilisation with the gold wire, yet die regardless in a few days if he were to chose the big mac.

The merchant's wallet shows it with a label. On this example there are two transactions that are RBF labelled (yellow), and then double spent (red label): [
If no label, no RBF, zero conf works. If there is a yellow label, the merchant can decide to not give the product until the first confirmation. If there is a red label, you don't give the product until confirmed.  
But regardless or RBF or no RBF, zero conf is not safe, because there is a way to double spend a non-RBF transaction on any chain. It doesn't work 100% of the time, but it's a risk.  
The relatively safest way to spend bitcoin instantly right now is LN transactions, because they are sort of pre-confirmed.

The increases have to slow down. As the price grows the same new amount of money coming in increases the price less. 
To demonstrate, imagine the price is 10. To push it to 20 you need 10. Now, to double again you need 20 new money. At this point the price is 40. To double again you need 40 new money. The amount of new money needed for to sustain doubling every year is exponentially growing, which is possible for a while but not forever. The number of years you need to wait for a doubling will increase over time. But it’s still an amazing investment that outperforms all else even with the expected slowdown.

You are not updating the blockchains, still it’s secure. That’s the beauty. And it’s extremely fast.
It’s not meant for hft. It’s meant for wallets and merchants. For example if you have ltc but the merchant wants btc you can swap on the fly within the app. It will be virtually transparent tot the user. Somewhere on the other side of the world, a trader will buy your LTC on lightning and give the merchant BTC. Trader makes money by selling the BTC for slightly higher than market prices to make up for keeping his channel open for you to use.

1) Multiple detect RBF and double spending, for example greenwallet.
2) If 0-conf is as safe on Bitcoin with RBF opt-in as it used to be. Bitrefill for example is a merchant that does a ton of business and accepts 0-conf Bitcoin payments for small amounts. They also accept LN instantly btw.
3) It's true there are risks, but LN is still safer than 0 conf overall. There is a reason why exchanges and merchants accept LN payments instantly (the few that support it), yet typically require at least 3 confirmations on-chain.
Since you're proposing to use alts, let's not forget that alt transactions with relatively small hashpower like BCH, BSV, BTG, overall have a bigger risk than Bitcoin non-RBF zero conf or LN, because at any point a small pool, or a wealthy person can attack, rewrite entire blocks, or replay transactions on a fork, etc. This is not a theoretical risk, but has been done multiple times on various alts, and is being done regularly.
So overall, the best course of action for minimal risk on all sides:
1. Choose Bitcoin LN for small transactions if it's accepted
2. Choose Bitcoin non-RBF zero conf for small transactions if accepted
3. Choose Bitcoin RBF for large transactions if it doesn't need to be accepted immediately
4. Choose Bitcoin non-RBF if RBF is not available, preferably native segwit bc1
5. And if none of the above is available for some reason, choose ETH, LTC or other alts that have a relatively large hash-power and rely on proof of work and true decentralisation
6. If none of the above is available choose XRP or other fast alts
@_date: 2019-04-29 15:58:39
You get pretty good security on zero-conf on Bitcoin too, as long as the transaction is sent without RBF flag.

There are multiple ideas, one of them is called lightning network. In simple terms it's a special kind of bitcoin wallet that allows you to create a smart contract with another bitcoin wallet, and you can lock bitcoins with this user. Once the bitcoins are locked in with a transaction, you can start using this smart contract to send each other extremely small fractions of bitcoins, even one satoshi. Whenever you're done, you can make another transaction to 'settle'.
The cool thing about this system is that if your contact is connected to other people you can send or receive 'lightning bitcoins' to or from them too. Now, imagine when that friend is Amazon, or Coinbase who are connected to millions of lightning network users. Suddenly everybody will be able to send and receive between each other instantly and without fees or for extremely low fees (like 0.1 cent). No need to wait for confirmations, and no need to settle for weeks or months. You could collect your salary per hour in small increments, rather than every two weeks. You can pay per view pages on pay sites, rather than paying a subscription fee. You can sell your electricity generated from your solar panels per minute if you like. This system opens up a huge number of amazing use cases.
Bitcoin users currently do one to ten transactions per months on bitcoin. In the near future we will be doing literally thousands a day, all confirmed near instantly (within a second). And we will only use the bitcoin blockchain when we need to increase our channel capacity, or for making large purchases, like buying a boat or a house, because average people wouldn't have a lightning channel big enough to handle such large purchases.
The second cool thing about lightning is that while currently bitcoin holders not part of the bitcoin economy actively, they are just passive holders, in the future when lightning network starts they will be able to earn income by providing the channel capacity for others and collect fees in return. In other words, while bitcoin miners will still collect on chain fees like always, channel operators processing millions of transactions will collect small fees from micro-transactions too. For example if you have 10 BTC and you process 1M transactions for people every months, you could earn $100-1,000 from this passively, if you charge 0.01 to 0.1 cents per transaction. So people will be buying BTC to operate these channels.

Well, we can't really tell what would've happened if we have double the block space compared to what we have now. It's possible certain businesses stayed away from Bitcoin, in the fear or being priced out.

 There are 7K public Ethereum nodes vs 10K Bitcoin public nodes. Blockchain size is roughly the same, but you need an SSD to run an Ethereum node because it’s too much data coming through. The capacity of Ethereum is appr. 15tx/s vs Bitcoin around 4tx/s.

It most certainly does not follows the original protocol. It has been hardforked away from that multiple times. The difficulty adjustment is not 2 weeks anymore, is it?
Bitcoin Cash's developers are conflicted. They want to build a decentralized currency, but they created a system where only a few very wealthy individuals will be able to validate the chain.
There are dozens of chains that are better than either BCH or BSV. If not Bitcoin for some reason, users have better options.
BCH on-chain is fundamentally unsafe to use. It hasn't even solved malleability, and the low hashrate allows it to be attacked, as we have seen with the BSV drama. There will be more attacks to short the price.

No, it won't outstrip it. It will accelerate it. Also, the cool thing about bitcoin is that you can mine it with excess energy that would otherwise be lost. Most bitcoin farms are next to damns. You can't reduce the size of the damn by 10% because there is not enough demand at certain times, it would just be wasted capacity. However you can sell it to miners to generate value in form of security for a financial system. It's a win-win.
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:29:20

People buy brands primarily. Secondly they buy value. If your alt has a strong brand and provides good value, you are good.
Bitcoin has a very strong brand. Appr. half the world has heard about it and millions trust it. It’s synonymous with crypto in most cases, like google is synonymous with web search. The advantage here is virtually insurmountable. There is lots of competition among alts. They mostly fight each other for the second, third, etc place to be most known after Bitcoin. Will it be XRP, ETH, LTC, Nano? Nobody knows. 
Bitcoin has a great value as the most decentralized and most secure crypto that transfers the most value daily and has multiple second layer and sidechain projects as well as base layer improvements in the works. Ethereum has proven itself to be not censorship resistant and not safe losing hundreds of millions in value in faulty contracts. All alts are way more volatile than Bitcoin and smaller blockchains are routinely hacked. Low general acceptance makes them less valuable for the common man. Alt networks may be able to create better value than bitcoin, but they have a strong competition with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin can theoretically take their best ideas and take away their advantage. Again, tough challenge. 
Currently, Bitcoin is your best best long term. The rest is gamble.

There is not enough capacity to process all transactions that people submit to the network. Higher fee transactions fill the blocks and lower fee transactions wait in the mempool until there are no competing transactions with higher fees. 
You can accelerate your transaction if it was sent with RBF in the first place. If not, you will have to just wait.

It has to be done in order, because this order helps resolve the tragedy of the commons problem. Nobody will upgrade things, if they don't have a personal incentive just for the sake of the group. If they have a personal incentive, they will do it, and it will benefit them and the whole group too.
bc1 native segwit addresses will be incentivized by offering lower transaction fees. In result every user individually, and the network as a whole benefits.
Schnorr needs to be adopted by a great majority so the soft-fork can be pushed through. Again, lower fees and higher confidentiality will encourage adoption on an individual level, and the network as a whole benefit again.
Finally, when all the above has been exhausted any tiny block size increase will give us ton more capacity, so the benefit/risk ration is much higher and thus it will happen more likely even if we need a hard fork.

This call to action is the market at work. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:07:17
Impossible to tell, but there are 8,000+ public nodes. It's likely these nodes are not just set up for sitting idle. These are economically active actors. Judging from my friends who use LN, they probably make hundreds or thousands of transactions per month. People are gambling, upvoting, commenting, painting, etc. using lots of small LN transactions. When LN is used, people make dozens of transactions, very different use case from on-chain use.
I think it's safe to say that there are probably around 20K nodes in total, doing at least 5-20 transactions each per day. So we're probably looking at hundreds of thousands of transactions a day. Not quite as many as on chain yet, but in a year two LN transactions will likely surpass on-chain transactions in quantity, but not in value.

* Centralized ownership: More than 2 million owned by two entities and its getting worse
* Centralized mining: Majority of mining is done by two entities
* Low comparative hashrate, and thus weak security, recently undergone attack by a wealthy individual halting most transactions for weeks, and likely to suffer from similar attacks in the future
* Toxic community, that is based and united almost entirely around the hate of Bitcoin
* Deceptive marketing communication, that is based on trying to hijack the uninformed public, and scam them by selling them 'fake Bitcoin'
* Conflicted development 'team' that puts faith in a small number of centralized actors to run nodes, for a product that derives value from being decentralized
* No competitive technological advantage compared to literally dozens of alts that offer the same or significantly better functionality

Raising the blocksize is not an issue, it's a very easy change. The problem is that we will grow the blockchain size faster. Altcoins don't have this issue because they have few transactions, so the blockchain doesn't grow faster even with a large possible block size. Except for Ethereum which does have transactions and thus the blockchain did grow much bigger than Bitcoin is much less time.  
Having said that we do have a regular backlog of tens of thousands of transactions on Bitcoin. A very modest 5-10% increase in blocksize a year would be welcome and sustainable. It would not matter if the blockchain is 245MB or 255MB, but the fees would be kept sub $1/kb.

That's actually an amazing piece of news! It's like 2012 all over again, when Bitcoin adoption was on the rise. The difference this time is that LN can actually scale 100x beyond what Bitcoin could on-chain without sacrificing decentralization. Bitcoin serves 1-5 million people now. LN can serve 100-500 million with some scaling on the base layer, like more Segwit adoption, Schnorr, and some modest block size increase to 2-4-8 MB on the longer term as the Core team proposes. At that point we're serving 10% of the world population while preserving the core values of Bitcoin. Exciting prospects.

This is great, but why would you give up your BTC for gold, which has arguably less utility and has an unpredictable issuance policy?  
I think opulence is on a decline. It's becoming increasingly icky to show off wealth which is what gold is about for a big part of the world. New wealth is concentrated in the hands of tech billionaires, and they are not buying gold. It's only bought by old world rich who are literally dying out with their desire to buy gold.  
Also, gold is an element that can be reliably created from other metals in nuclear facilities, can be abundantly mined from asteroids, and be found currently hard to reach locations on earth. All these methods of generating gold are currently more expensive than traditional mining, but tech advancements are bringing the price of alternative mining methods down rapidly and at one point will create an abundance of the metal on the market. This is happening with diamonds now, as we have the technology to create artificial diamonds that are indistinguishable from natural diamonds and China is about flood the market with such gems bringing the price of diamond down like crazy. At least with diamonds there is a sentimental value for natural diamonds and their flaws, but with gold there is no such thing. At a certain point it will be relatively easy to create new gold, even if gold holding population would object to these new mining capabilities.  
With BTC the mining is set in stone and protected by the users themselves, so unless it benefits the users to increase mining for some currently unforeseen reason, the newly mined bitcoins will remain stable and predictable.

It’s important to know that number of transactions have dropped because of batching. Instead of 100th of individual transactions exchanges are sending one transaction with many outputs. Thus you get the same or more effective transactions within one bitcoin transaction. See the proof here, this chart counts the outputs which is the meaningful metric: 
The outputs are increasing suggesting that bitcoin usage is actually growing.
It’s fascinating how wrong uneducated investors can be if they don’t know the technology well enough. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 00:53:35
Nobody says one address = one person. We are just saying that there is correlation between number of users and number of times these users use the network and active addresses. Remember it costs money to make a transaction, so nobody is incentivized to just make random transactions to inflate an abstract metric. It’s most likely more users using the network more.
If the network was free to use the argument could be made that someone is just testing or inflating numbers for speculative purposes, but it’s not the case here.

Before he gave the reins to Gavin he was battling cancer. At the time it wasn’t obvious that bitcoin will worth billions. Not even to Satoshi himself. He may have not arranged handing over the keys to someone in time. At the time it felt like there is no need to secure the handover of your bitcoins. Whoever wanted bitcoins could just mine it for themselves easily on their laptop. You could mine dozens in a few weeks, without much effort. There were barely any transactions beyond the coinbase transactions. Not hard for your computer to process or download the blockchain. 
People who knew him think he is unfortunately dead. Yes, there are people who met him all the way up to 2012. He was a grounded, short, mostly Caucasian guy in his late forties who spoke perfect English with a North American accent according to descriptions.
I don’t have any proof. I just heard the same description from two separate people many years ago who allegedly met him. At the time Bitcoin wasn’t more than a curiosity. There was no incentive to come up with a story and coordinate between people to make it feel real. So believe it. You don’t have to.
There is an alternate theory which started circulating somewhat later which says Satoshi disappeared when Gavin was invited for an interview by the authorities. This sounds logical, because back in those days any alternative currency was attacked harshly by the governments. Jail time was part of punishment for any creator. On the other hand at that point Satoshi already wanted out, hence he gave the committer role to Gavin, so his disappearance because of the interview may just have been a coincidence that fits a conspiracy narrative. And he disappeared because of his illness, not because he was scared.

Let’s assume he’s right and Bitcoin will indeed go to 100K+ within 5 years. This means buying anytime now below 10K is a smart move.

Bitcoin with LN is perfect then, because it's both secured by POW through miners, and it is essentially POS because putting your bitcoins into channels will allow you to generate fees, which is similar to POS from a user's perspective.

Even if it becomes 1 cent. Can you send it over the internet? Nope. 
In the future lots of automated systems will communicate to do business together. An autonomous car may ask for a best route from a system that is specialized to predict traffic for 0.01 cent. The prediction software may in return ask for a satellite image for 0.005 cent. Etc. You get the idea. These machines may do a million such nano businesses a second with all different parties and they will automatically shop around for the best information and the lowest price. Impossible to establish trust or open an account with every single one dynamically. 
Yes, you can hack it together by other means but a decentralized and trustless currency will be superior and more efficient.

This is pretty exciting. The implications of such technology are immense. Theoretically even large payments could be streamed through a single narrow channel by sending multiple small chunks, as long as the receiver is able to receive the money.
Combine this with automatic channel creation and you get a system where you can receive on LN *any* amount of bitcoins, as the capacity of channels do not really matter, and the receiver can rebalance their funds automatically by opening more channels to themselves.

By selling and tanking the price of BTC he’s acting against the interest of the people he supposedly represents.

It's annoying that bitpay introduced the 'payment protocol'. Very few Bitcoin wallets support it.

So being safe from the whims of governments is not a value in your opinion? Being able to open an account without permission and for free is not a value either? I could go on, but I would love to hear how you argue against those points.
Scalability is a gigantic problem, that is being tackled as we speak. With LN and sidechains, we introduced 100-1000x scaling just in the last 2 years. There are many ideas on how we can scale even more. Serving the whole globe is not an insolvable issue, just takes time. We literally have to invent things. It's not like this has been done before. :)
Users of Bitcoin do use it as currency, and also as a payment system, and also as investment, and also as a store of value. There are multiple legitimate uses, and your claim that it has no value besides currency is (decidedly by users) is not correct.
Fiat is backed by countries, that occasionally decide to not back it at all, and in all cases they devalue it systematically. That's an inherent risk people realise more and more. This is a risk that Bitcoin removes, because as you said it's backed by people, people around the world of diverse backgrounds which ensures the outmost security against unforeseen events in a local area.

It's legal. All traders use it in all markets. However machine learning can only build on historic data. It can give you predictions that are in line with historical movements. It can't predict the irrational price movements that assets like Bitcoin follows.

Bitcoin is pretty secure, but nothing is entirely secure. If you are handling Bitcoin with skill, you're safer than with any other asset. Everything is hackable, banks loose millions of dollars daily to all kinds of attacks. Bitcoin however, doesn't have a known attack vector at this time.
Bitcoin is traceable, it's a public and open ledger. However, you can only tell that a certain amount of bitcoin is going from one account to another. If you don't know who is behind a certain account, you can't really deduce any meaningful information. If you buy Bitcoins on an exchange with a real identity there is a way to trace your coins to an extent for a while, unless you use wallets like Wasabi, which obfuscate the coins.
Disadvantage of Bitcoin is that not everyone accepts it, so you can't just live on it right now. You have to either sell Bitcoin for a local currency or buy gift cards to be able to buy everyday items. But you can certainly buy almost everything online including electronics, plane tickets, hotels, phone top-ups, gift cards for all major retailers, etc. Another "disadvantage" is that there is no "customer service" for Bitcoin. If you fuck up your coins, by sending it to the wrong address or losing your private keys, there is nobody to go to help you. You are your own bank which a huge responsibility. But this is what gives it value as well. Nobody can take your bitcoins or stop you from spending them either.
Adoption is growing every year, so in the future it will not be a disadvantage. The customer service issue can be fixed if people who are not willing to be their own banks rely on custodial services, like Coinbase for example, who will keep your Bitcoins for you, and allow you to have a wallet to spend from the custodial wallet. This is no different from a bank, with all its risks, but it gives the option to users who are unwilling to learn how to use bitcoin properly. I don't recommend such custodial services for any significant amount. But you can use them for small amounts. For example BlueWallet is a custodial Bitcoin Lightning Network wallet, which makes using LN very user friendly, and I think it's an acceptable risk to put $10 in such a wallet for everyday tipping or small micropayments. But it would irresponsible to send thousands of dollars value to such a wallet.

An obvious attack vector is to buy a bunch of nano to get voting power, short it with an even bigger number, disrupt the network, and then profit. POS (proof of stake) is an interesting idea, but it's not solved fully yet. It works as long as the stakes are low.
Byteball built DAG before IOTA and Nano. Byteball has better wallet features, like betting, insurance, exchange, etc.
Having said that it's exciting to see all these technologies testing various methods in the real world.

So you can send and receive Bitcoin payments instantly, for virtually no fee, confidentially (pretty much), and trustlessly.
You can only earn cents right now routing other people's transactions. It's negligible even over a year, but maybe in the future this becomes dollars and eventually hundreds of dollars, who knows...

They won’t be destroyed. They will be the biggest holders of Bitcoin. They have the USD to buy it and to mine it. 
Banks will slowly move from being custodians of you USD to be custodians of your Bitcoin, like Coinbase. Plus they will offer all the same services they always have. Loans, credit cards, interest on deposits, managing investment, etc. 
Bitcoin gives you the option to hold your digital money on your phone, but many people will opt their bank taking care of most of their savings. Imagine when a big factory changes to BTC for payrolls. Do you think every worker will learn about backups and all to hold their own BTC? No, they will just use a bank like Coinbase that will handle BTC for them and the workers will just use the bank’s custodial wallet to pay for their expenses.

You create a new LN channel with on-chain transaction by sending the LN coins to yourself. Thus you free up your old channels to be able to receive more. And you will have a new channel that has all the funds, so you can use it to pay anyone if needed.
Alternatively if you want to remove those coins from LN, you can simply send them to a regular bitcoin address where you keep your savings.

I don’t think that solves fungibility. The problem is that on Bitcoin some organizations could say these coins are tainted because they are related to some activity they disapprove. The taint remains no matter what you do with Monero. 
Monero solves anonymity for an individual, but not fungibility.

Network effect has little to do with mining power. Network effect is understood as the value that comes from wide adoption.
If you have 1 million people with BTC wallets and coins, it's going to be hard for LTC to unseat BTC if there are only 100,000 people with LTC wallets and coins. I always ask for Bitcoin as payment, because virtually nobody uses any other coins for payments. I never been offered any other coin as payment by anyone in the last 10 years. Even if people have it, they don't even bother asking, because most people want BTC. And because of this, any new people introduced will also get BTC wallets. Thus, the network effect favours BTC, even if it's slower.
If in hypothetical scenario, BTC and LTC were to start out in parallel Today, it's possible LTC would win, but not certain. Having a shorter confirmation time introduces risks, that will become apparent once LTC is worth attacking because it's more valuable. If LTC was constantly attacked, people would actually migrate to BTC and BTC would become a winner yet again.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:03:25

That DNS would be a huge target for attacks, and it would also ruin privacy, wouldn't it?
But technically there are such 2 layer solutions. For example I think on Coinbase you can send a person BTC through their email. Or that tip I gave you, it's going to your reddit username, not your BTC address directly.
I don't think public addresses are a huge problem for adoption. People have been using bank accounts with success for a long time.

It's your prerogative to give a meaning to any word, but that is considered an equivocation fallacy.
Networks effects greatly benefit Bitcoin, it's the most trusted and well known crypto. Many use the word Bitcoin, when they talk about crypto in general. Bitcoin is used as a reserve currency for all other alts. Bitcoin has at least one of the best (if not the best) development teams, and one of the best ideas (if not the best) for scaling going forward. We will see which one works out, but based on early success, it seems like Bitcoin is succeeding in every area, and absorbing successful ideas from alts successfully through base layer upgrades, second layer solutions, and sidechains.
I personally don't take alts for payment, only Bitcoin. Not that anybody ever offered anything else but Bitcoin. It's the default crypto in business for payments.
Alts are predominantly used for speculation and testing new ideas. The actual use of them as currency is extremely limited compared to Bitcoin in my experience. You can always find examples for everything, but typically it's all about Bitcoin, and occasionally some random alt comes into the picture.
There are thousands of alt coins, yet more than half of the total marketcap is Bitcoin. It stands above all else like a giant among ants. There are only two coins that are contenders, but they are not likely survive other alts coming out with better features to take their position.
XRP can be considered to have an artificially high marketcap, because it was premined and most of the coins are in one hand. It's also not a true decentralized crypto. It's a hybrid between crypto and a service like PayPal. Stellar and several others will likely take some of Ripple's market, and weaken its position in the coming years.
Ethereum is interesting and a serious contender, but it's a super risky project (by design). The complexity of Ethereum creates a huge attack vector. This is why people have lost so much money on faulty contracts in 3 major events so far. The latest hard fork Constantinople was called off just hours before launch. The core developers didn't find a major bug in the upgrade, and they got lucky because a third party tipped them off about an attack vector that would've been made possible with the hard fork. Who knows how many such bugs still exist in this HF, and upcoming upgrades. There is a chance a devastating bug will kill off Ethereum entirely, just like DAO died because of a single bug. Also, other projects that are more efficient at scaling and running smart contracts, will seriously challenge Ethereum's position in the coming years, like EOS, Tron, IOTA, etc.
So, it's perfectly reasonable to make a distinction between Bitcoin and all else. Bitcoin is very dominant in the crypto economy, and will remain so for a long time. Even if the market cap of an alt would take over Bitcoin, it will take 5-10 years to overtake Bitcoin's brand recognition. But it's not like Bitcoin is staying still, there is tons of development going on, and LN seems to be growing faster and works better than anyone expected. It is currently the best way to pay with crypto overall. There is no safe and serious crypto that is faster, and more user friendly. Bitcoin is killing it!

You don't necessarily need to run an LN node just for the lntips. You can do the following:
1. Go to [
2. Here you can create an invoice for depositing satoshis.
3. Then, you go to [ and select BTC to BTC Lightning
4. Paste into the BTC Lightning field the invoice number you got from lntipbot
5. That's it. You funded your lntipbot
6. You can now tip people
7. You can do the reverse to get BTC
Another option is to create a custodial LN wallet, like Blue Wallet, and there you can convert your BTC to LN BTC, and then you can pay the lntipbot invoice too. Same idea, but you use your own custodial wallet instead of zigzag.
Obviously, it's best if you use your own LN node.

With higher segwit adoption, and more batching, we can do 500,000. With Schnorr we can do 700,000. At that point with a modest base blocksize increase to 2 and then 4MB, we can do \~1,500,000 - 3,000,000 transactions per day. Suddenly we can onboard 1 billion people in less than a year. Not to mention various side chains, like RBTC, LBTC, etc. Also, not everybody will hold their keys. Lots of people with small funds will use custodial wallets with a small amount of LN BTC, like they hold some Apple or Amazon credits. And it will take a decade until there is a billion people want to onboard, so with continuous development in the next 10 years we will be able to keep the delicate balance to make sure we are not stalling the adoption, but we also don't kill the whole project because virtually nobody can run a node at home anymore.

Bitcoin is already a 2nd gen coin itself. There were several tries before Bitcoin that failed, because they weren't good enough. Bitcoin succeeded because it had all the elements for success together.
The coins you mentioned that exist Today don't provide major improvements over Bitcoin. They all provide different features sacrificing some fundamental values that make Bitcoin valuable. There are over 2,000 coins out there, and they share only 40% of the marketshare.
If we're talking about a hypothetical new coin that has:
* Fair distribution, not pre-mined or other BS, (ex. BTC airdrop, like Byteball was)
* Provides instant confirmed transactions, like LN, but even faster without the need to open channels on chain first
* Transaction is free (not very cheap)
* Is significantly easier to implement for merchants, like literally checking off a checkbox in their systems
* Has less volatility than Bitcoin
* Is growing in value faster than Bitcoin
* Has proved itself for at least 5 years for being secure and reliable
* Has a stronger brand name and identity
* Has more choice of wallets and platforms than Bitcoin
* Has more hardware and exchange support than Bitcoin
* Has significantly simpler and easier to learn codebase than Bitcoin
If all this checks out, then there is a chance, still not a certainty. But most 2nd gen coins are lucky to have 1 or 2 out of these criteria.

This wastes energy rhetoric is wrong. It doesn’t waste it. It produces value from electricity. Also it ‘wastes’ excess waste energy predominantly which would go unused if not for Bitcoin. Bitcoin allows green energy plants be profitable and thus it actually helps the green energy transition. Things are sometimes more complex than you see in the surface. 
You must be very young if you think 100 years ago is not ‘recent’. You should listen to people with longer time perspective as they have a better grasp on possible events. Some of us have lived through multiple recessions and regime changes in various countries which wiped out people’s savings. Most kids have no idea how quickly and how unexpected it can be. There are signs but you cannot believe it if you have only seen relative stability in your life. 
Hyperinflation in the US is not likely in the next 10 years, but in many other countries there is a huge chance for it. And it will eventually come for the USD too because the government is printing money like crazy to pay for the loans they are taking out. This is not sustainable and eventually people will start losing trust in the USD. Once the value starts falling the government will not start collecting USD and burning it to stop hyperinflation. They will print more to make up for the lost value. Vicious cycle. Happened dozens of times in all cultures and in all continents. Why do you think you state is somehow smarter? What is your strong reason?

Bitcoin is a global distributed open ledger that allows value to be transmitted peer-2-peer between two parties.
The fact that it's independent from state currencies, it's literally the money of the free people of the world.
Investing is the wrong word. I use Bitcoin as you can see from my tip to you.
It is already a global currency. People from all countries use it every day. It will become less volatile in the future when it reaches market saturation, meaning it can't grow its user base significantly anymore. Currently only a few million people use it. Once a few billion people use it, it will reach saturation. We're 3 magnitudes away from saturation. Btw, value grows exponentially with adoption not linearly, because the number of connections between users grows exponentially as well, giving the network exponentially more value.
Since we're very far from saturation, any time is a good time, even at peak prices, but for sure a depressed price gives you even more advantage to grow the value of your savings.
You can buy bitcoin on crypto currency exchanges, like Coinbase. Small amounts can be stored on smart phone wallets, and larger amounts should be stored on dedicated hardware wallets, like Trezor or Ledger.
Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoins. It's a reward mechanism for people who run powerful dedicated supercomputers that secure the network through a process called proof of work. In simple terms these computers have to guess a lucky number so they can process transactions and in return they are provided bitcoins. This reward is made up of two parts. One is a gradually decreasing so called block reward, which is currently BTC 12.5, and it will become half of that in about 1 year or so, and half of that again in about 5 years. So, gradually less bitcoin is generated, so it will become more and more scarce as time goes by, which means that the price of Bitcoin has to increase if the demand is stable or increasing. The second part is made of the fees that bitcoin users voluntarily pay to encourage miners to include their transactions in the next block.

Bitcoin has more liquidity by far than any other crypto, which makes it stronger.

Well, hopefully in a year or two when we have the next bubble, many exchanges will offer LN withdrawal, so when buying bitcoin people either won't have to touch the blockchain at all, or only touch once and then already be onboarded to LN, so their further transactions like sending the coins back to the exchange won't touch the blockchain anymore. Thus, LN will move a large percentage of transactions off-chain. And there is also Liquid, which frees up the Bitcoin blockchain from exchange to exchange transactions, which is a lot because traders move their coins around a ton. Finally, more of segwit adoption (Gemini announced they will introduce it soon), batching and hopefully Schnorr will also all provide plenty of space to grow transactions on chain.

Roger and Bitmain are trying to keep BCH alive because they have so much of it. If it loses value their holding lose tens of millions and they will never be able to liquidate it because there is no market. They have been buying BCH to keep the price up and they are now mining BCH at a major loss to keep the hash rate up against an attack everyone was warning them against forever. The price you see Today would be ⅓  naturally like BTG’s price if it wasn’t propped up artificially by these two players. 
They have tons of money so who knows how long they will keep doing this. They thought if they keep doing it for long enough they can build momentum and people will start using the network. But the problem is it’s not happening because for investors it’s not a safe coin to be in, and for users there is no network effect. Virtually nobody accepts BCH is private life. The only thing going for them is that quite a lot of companies are accepting BCH alongside of BTC. But they also accept ETH and LTC and both are faster than BCH. There is no incentive to use BCH over LTC if you needed an alternative to BTC for any reason. And it’s best to stick to BTC anyway because most people use it and it’s the least volatile of all. 
The problem for Bitmain and Roger is they are eroding trust and centralizing mining and governance and ownership of BCH tokens in this process of artificial prop up. They lost a big part of their community with this recent split, because it wasn’t just nChain. There is a significant number of people and businesses who supported him too. Maybe 10-15% of their community. They also created an adversary with huge resources who will now plot to destroy BCH and prove himself (w)right. He’s not wrong either. If the network can be attacked it should be tested and attacked because the whole point of crypto is that it should survive and operate in adversarial conditions. It’s still evil to do this, but it’s also valuable testing.
The point is once Roger or Bitmain accepts reality and stops propping BCH up the bottom will fall out. The price, the hash power, the community and even company support will go away. And at that point multiple parties will start attacking the chain constantly for short term gains, like they attack small coins. There will be no turning back. The BCH experiment is about to fail. But it gave great insights to both economics and technological ideas.
For example, we now know thanks to BCH what the reasonable limits of block size increase are. It can go up to 8MB relatively safely but at 32MB propagation is becoming a problem as nChain learned the hard way. BTC can safely double block size if there is an emergency of hundreds of thousands of unconfirmed transactions and $10+ fees for weeks on end. But not beyond that in this decade. We have to keep working on LN and sidechains for major scaling.

If anything, it's positive, because locked up bitcoins can't be sold on exchanges that don't support LN. But soon it will have a neutral effect, as exchanges start to accept LN deposits and withdrawals. At that point the value of the network grows because transfers are faster, more confidential and cheaper. So only positive affect on price at every stage of development.

The risk is that the receiver never claims the funds. But that’s a risk you take with off-chain payments too if you don’t double check with the address owner. It’s possible they lost the private key to a donation address, yet they have the public key on the site.

You have to be more specific with timelines. Most devs understand and are for raising the blocksize when the time is right, which is not now, or in the near future. First, they want to implement optimisations that can help Bitcoin scale without raising the blocksize, then once we have a safe way to do it we will raise the blocksize to make sure the demands for growth are met. It makes sense to do these optimizations first anyway, so we can squeeze out the maximum amount of transactions from any modest blocksize increase. That's the plan listed on [bitcoin.org]( since 2015.
Just by switching to bech32 addresses (starting with bc1...) you can increase bitcoin's transaction capacity more than 50% compared to legacy addresses. Batching, schnorr, and and LN will all help to delay the blocksize increase, so technology has time (several years) to become faster, bigger, and at the same time cheaper, so the increased speed of blockchain growth will remain manageable. When you can buy a mini computer with 10TB HD for $100, and most people have 100MB+ internet connections, we will have no problem running 2MB blocks.

BTC difficulty is dropping because some miners are busy fighting over BCH. We will be adjusting BTC difficulty -7% in a few hours in result of that. 
This difficulty drop will be very enticing for miners to mine BTC, so no miner but the two fighting parties will remain mining the forked chains: BCHABC and BCHVS.
It’s likely both chains will survive, both with relatively low hash powers and thus unsafe against further forks and attacks. This will make them less valuable and the downward spiral begins to stabilize at a much lower price level. We are looking at a bit above BTG level prices potentially. 
Even if just one survives, the events showed to investors and services how vulnerable and centralized (in terms of mining and governace) the small hashrate chains are, and thus will pull out causing the same downward spiral.

The video says that we're creating more and more poverty, but statistics says otherwise. All indicators show that less people live in poverty, the average lifespan is growing, and generally things are getting better. It is true that at the same time disparity between the rich and poor is growing, because the wealth of the rich is growing even faster than the poor, but that doesn't make more objectively poor people, just more poor people relative to the richest.
We may all be getting better off because of the unprecedented efficiencies automation, robotisation, and machine learning is bringing to our economies. These efficiencies may be so big, that they allow us to extend the era of decadence longer and longer. We may be able to expand our economies forever, because we may not be limited by the resources on land on Earth. We may start building cities in the middle of the Oceans, start mining asteroids, establish colonies on the Moon, build cities on Mars, and create gigantic space stations for hundreds of thousands of people. We may be able to escape the predicted societal collapse thanks to technology.
But, let's assume this documentary paints a fairly correct picture of the world in its current state, and makes reliable predictions on our gloomy future. How does Bitcoin help us? The documentary suggest gold is the solution, but Bitcoin is of course a better version of gold.
Does Bitcoin have any chance? Is it possible to take away the power from those who are the richest and most powerful in the world? The combined wishes of these folks start massive wars, and reshape governments and country borders to serve their needs. Does Bitcoin have a shot against such forces? Well, gold is still around, even though there were attempts to destroy its value.
The fight is not going to be easy by any means. I'm surprised Bitcoin was allowed to be developed to this point when on the horizon we can already see the solutions for a Bitcoin that can serve the globe. As Bitcoin grows stronger it will do two things: It will demonstrate that there is an alternative, and educate people about not just Bitcoin but about the larger context that this documentary alluded to. It will also awaken the folks in power and they will come down hard on Bitcoin. This is going to be a massive struggle with masses of weak awoken people trying to stand their ground, and the a super powerful conservative minority. On the sidelines we will have a bunch of clueless people who will shift their position based which side's propaganda is stronger.
Bitcoin is going to win eventually, and it will become the symbol of this new more just world order. But there is a lot to go down before that happens. This is not going to happen overnight. This is going to be an endurance game. In a way you my friends, the hodlers have the chance to make a huge difference in world history and global wellbeing. Do your part to help Bitcoin grow stronger any way you can: code, design, educate, use, hodl, etc.

That’s the beauty of LN. It’s kind of like the internet. Similarly how the channel between you and your internet provider provides you with access to most of the internet, the LN channel will allow you to pay to most of the LN network through routing.

Fundamentally Satoshi created Bitcoin with the intention to create money that is independent and safe from states as much as possible, in a similar way how the internet decentralized and freed up information exchange in general, and how open source decentralized software development and gave free access to everyone.
He proposed a genius technical solution that gave us the fundamentals, but he understood that Bitcoin will have to evolve as technical challenges arise. It's very clear he didn't intend the white paper to be a bible to be followed to the letter till the end of times. He seem to have cared more about bring the vision to reality, not the specifics of the implementation.
Also, Bitcoin itself technically didn't realize the vision of peer-to-peer with Bitcoin itself yet. It is more of a hybrid network with some properties of p-2-p. However, the Lightning Network did realize the vision, because it's a true p-2-p network.

No need for a petition. I think the market will sort this out. I think BCH will be dropped organically by Coinbase the next few years, because it won't be among the top cryptos and it will only be a nag on the system.
If anything will threaten Bitcoin it will be a coin with better technology, which doesn't mean a "bigger block". BCH is essentially LTC, just slower and with more centralized mining. The more time passes, the less it matters that BCH shares ancient history with Bitcoin, thus the only benefit of potential network effect will fade. In fact shared history is a risk, because there will be large old holders of BCH who will dump their coins on the market when the price tanks below 0.1 permanently, because of traders who move on to other coins for pump and dump schemes. The writing is on the wall. The volume is already tanking, currently at just 7% of Bitcoin.

I think you don't have to be online all the time, just occasionally to check on your channels. Depends on the time lock setting.
Optimum path is an issue, but it's a mathematically 'solved' issue to a very high precision and probability.
If fees are too high, we can always raise the blocksize, as the Core roadmap lays it out.
Waiting periods are only a problem when you have a long time-lock. You can decide how you want it to be. If you have lots of funds lock it up with a longer time, if it's little funds lock it up with little time.

No, you interpreted my sentence incorrectly. I said there is no single currency or payment method that is universally accepted and can be used at any randomly chosen establishment.
For example, if you have US dollars and you're dropped in a large city in China, they won't sell you coffee. If you have a VISA card, you will have no luck buying anything in the Thai countryside.
If there was a game show and you would have to choose what form of money you can carry in order to survive and you had no option to go and use an exchange, your best bet would be small gold coins, but even that will not be easy to use, especially not for coffee.
So the criteria of LN is only good if it's accepted at my random coffee shop is a very standard, that no money achieved yet. Let's hope LN will. It would be super convenient travelling around the world, and not needing to fear your CC is stolen, nor there was a need lose money on the exchange rates.

I think the only situation when gold outperforms Bitcoin is in a post apocalyptic doomsday scenario, where there is no internet to speak of and electricity is scarce. 
However, there is also the gold abundance scenario when we find a method of gold production which floods the market with the metal pushing its price to never before seen in history.
However, those who are counting on Bitcoin becoming even more valuable because of some major breakdown of financial systems in the world, should be careful. Digitization, automation and robotization alongside AI will create enormous efficiencies in the economy in the next decades. This effect may save economies from collapsing and the financial system may survive into the mid 2050’s without any major disruptions, at which point we enter singularity which is where all speculations and estimations go out of the window. We just don’t know what will happen as it’s impossible to imagine like a 17th century scholar wouldn’t be able to imagine the technology Today (think multiple robots on Mars, landers on asteroids, all the world’s knowledge in everyone’s pocket, bitcoin, video conferencing being commonplace, DNA modified organisms beneficial to us, designer drugs, virtually no plagues left to eradicate, etc.)

On the short term, nobody knows what is the right time to enter. It may go more down, but it may not.
However, on the long term every time the user base doubles the value will roughly go 10x. This effect will be supported and maybe even accelerated by the halving in supply of new bitcoins every 4 years. Next one happening in 1.5 years.
We currently have a few million Bitcoin users at best. In the next 10-15 years it will likely reach close to market saturation of several billion users. So we're 9-10 user base doublings away from saturation: 2M &gt; 4M &gt; 8M &gt; 16M &gt; 32M &gt; 64M &gt; 128M &gt; 256M &gt; 512M &gt; 1B.
With every doubling the value of the network grows exponentially, because the number of connections increase by the power of two. You can come to understand this clearly if you imagine just 2 phones being able to create 1 connection, but 3 can make 3, and 4 can make 6, and 5 can make 10, etc. So the more nodes there are in a system, the value of the network grows not linearly but exponentially. This is why it's hard to overtake an established network. The network effect is too strong.
So by any estimate we have several 10x increases every few years. 30K, 300K, 3M, etc. are unimaginable now, but so was 3K a few years ago, when the price was 0.3, 3, 30, or even 300. People literally laughed at that notion.
However, once Bitcoin reaches millions of dollars valuation new forces will start influencing the valuation too. It will become too powerful. There is just not enough money in the world to grow any further, because at that point Bitcoin's market cap will be bigger than the largest currencies in the world. So, the dynamics will start to change, and if fiat doesn't go into hyperinflation Bitcoin's price won't go into the tens of millions per coin in my opinion. However if fiat does start to inflate, we will not be measuring price of Bitcoins, but Satoshis.
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:45:31
Calculation is roughly correct. LN alone is not the solution for global scaling. It’s a multiplier. For every on chain transaction now you can do thousands or even millions of off chain transactions. 
There are multiple ways we can improve things. 
One, the base blocksize will be increased. 8MB base block size will be a reality in 5-10 years. Suddenly we are talking about years not decades to onboard. 
Two, imagine a sidechain like Rootstock that can do 100x transactions compared to Bitcoin with LN (Raiden) on top. Suddenly we are not talking years but days. 
Three, imagine channel factories implemented at scale, which open and close channels 10x more efficiently. Now, we are talking not days but hours. 
Hours to onboard everyone on earth. With tech we already invented just not fully implemented. 
And the ideas keep coming. We will without a doubt invent new things that will bring about more possibilities. 
It’s not easy. But it will be done with hard work and ingenuity. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:25:23
Well, if it's indeed going to 100K after next halving, this may be the last time to get in cheap.

For setting up your initial channels or increasing them you still need on-chain transactions. 
Also, we need on-chain transactions for multiple side-chains.

Ok. We all have different risk tolerances. If you rather put your trust in your government fo ahead. It’s ran by really smart and selfless people. Nothing can go wrong there, right?
In the developed world currencies went bust often too. Germany had hyperinflation for example quite recently. Many other central European countries suffered the same too.
Inflation is good if you don’t care to save for the future. If you are willing to gamble that you will be healthy and competitive in 10 years. We know fiat is not safe for 10 years because even in the most successful countries it loses half its value. So you need to either gamble on the stock market or some other markets which are proven to be as volatile as young Bitcoin. So what is your plan?
Btw, it’s not a binary issue. You can be mostly in fiat but ready for plan B. You can invest anywhere from 1-99% of your savings depending on your risk assessment on both sides.

Thanks indeed. You are doing something that’s valuable to humanity on a level that’s hard to fully appreciate.
It’s not just the value everyday bitcoin use gives users. It’s also the fact that you are building plan B of a global financial system, which keeps the operators of plan A in check even if no major disruption happens to plan A.
Bitcoin is probably one of the biggest silent forces that keeps the elite somewhat more honest and fair than they would be without Bitcoin. Bitcoin is already saving the world without global adoption.

Those 2nd gen coins need to gain trust by operating for 3-5 years without major issues, and gain enough security to be taken seriously. Then gain brand recognition, grow a user base, and build an economy, which is another 4-5 years to match what Bitcoin has Today. At this point, they can start competing with Bitcoin, which at that point will have killed 95% of their use cases and is several times bigger than Today. Catching up will be extremely hard for any of these coins. Not impossible though. I can see how certain industries of geo areas could start using a 2nd gen coin more frequently than Bitcoin in a few years.

It's actually Monero mining. But they buy BTC every day. Good for Monero because of the hash power, good for BTC because of exchange rate.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:47:49
So, what would we switch to? A GPU mineable algo? Then what? BTC won't be the most secure chain in the world because we would be competing with ETH and another 100 coins for the hashpower. If BTC only has let's say 30-40% of the hashpower, it would mean the chain can be attacked by the remaining 60-70%. Currently that is not a threat because BTC commands 90% of the hashrate on the SHA256 ASICs.

The influence of major bitcoin companies on the evolution of Bitcoin doesn't make it a corporate coin, just like the influence of blockstream doesn't make the current chain a corporate coin.

@_date: 2019-01-29 07:26:01
1. P2SH ( addresses starting with 3..) is a wrapper for native segwit ( bc1 ), so it's a bit larger than it needs to be. It's extra 23 bytes. So this makes the transaction smaller and thus cheaper.
2. Because it saves space it reduces the load on node operators, which means Bitcoin is a bit more decentralized if more people use bc1 addresses.
3. More transactions fit into a block, so the network is faster to process transactions, and thus more valuable. Thus, your bitcoins will worth a bit more if many people use bc1 addresses.
4. It's faster for your wallet to process bc1 addresses, which is negligible, but still worth mentioning.
5. BC1 addresses have a checksum so they are safer from accidental changes when writing addresses or copy pasting. While other address types have similar checksums BC1 is superior. Could be relevant if you have some sort of low tech address transmission, like a fax or a screenshoot, etc.
6. BC1 addresses are obviously Bitcoin addresses so they won't be confused with some alt coin and thus sent to the wrong address, that may not be recoverable. This happens with traders dealing with multiple coins and exchanges.
So, it's a lot of small improvements that add up to a significant value for you personally and the network as a whole.

@_date: 2019-01-27 11:23:36
Yes, but this is not a binary question. Not increasing the blocksize is a risk that increases over time as pressure builds up, and centralization is a decreating risk as technology improves. There will be a point where the risk of centralization is close to zero, and the upside to increasing the block size is enormous. At that point, if you're rooting for Bitcoin, it's irrational to refuse to support the blocksize increase. At that point in the future virtually nobody will be against a blocksize increase. Just like the document by Gregory Maxwell states:

used to be a bitcoin forum to discuss controversial ideas that were moderated out of most importantly the idea of scaling bitcoin by raising the blocksize.
Now, it became a forum to promote the Bitcoin Cash altcoin. The reason they shit talk about Bitcoin is because their only chance to succeed is to destroy Bitcoin and take the brand name. Otherwise, many other altcoins are better in all different ways than BCH, so they have little chance to be relevant.

Hashare is dropping now a bit. It went down for 2 epochs and we're likely have a third one. So inflation rate is dropping too. Less bitcoin is released now. Sort of a self correcting mechanism. When price is rising more bitcoin is released which slows the price increase. When the price is dropping less bitcoin is released thus stopping the fall. Pretty ingenious really.
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:26:30
Maybe with batching it’s more than 2x, but nowhere near 10x. 
LN on the other hand which was enabled by Segwit did 10x already for sure. Just watching my friends, we do at least 10x on LN compared to 2017 on Bitcoin on chain. Mates are literally sending $5 to each other to pay for their lunch share and play roulette for 50 cents online. It’s like Bitcoin 5 years ago all over again, except this time it’s instantly confirming and even cheaper to send than ever.
Recently the custodial LN wallets have really pushed adoption. The good thing is that these custodial wallets are designed to be switched over to private nodes eventually, so larger amounts won’t need to be trusted to a third party.

I think the conclusion is don't trust a network that only has 5-10% of the hash capacity. It's proven multiple times over and over that smaller coins are trivially easy to attack. Even if BCH stabilizes and Craig backs off with BSV, the danger will constantly loom over both minority chains. Any medium sized pool or a few minor pools can attack and disrupt these coins at any time.

The argumentation has a faulty component.
On one hand you're saying Bitcoin won't survive because it was the first to implement a certain technology and firsts don't make it, thus 2nd gens will take over.
On the other hand, you strongly argue that 2nd gens implemented significant new tech, so there is enough differentiation to take over the market.
You can't have it both ways.
If 2nd gen is just evolutionary improvement, then it's not enough to overcome Bitcoin's network effect.
If 2nd gens are revolutionary, it means they are 1st gen in their tech, thus 2nd gen's successors will win. Neither Bitcoin, nor the 2nd gen will survive.
Either way 2nd gen coins are losers. Is that the point you're making?
Anyway, you can argue any side by creating arbitrary definitions of what's included in gen 1 or 2, etc.
Also, the biggest flaw in this thinking is to assume Bitcoin is static. It's not. It now has LN, which basically blows most alt out of the water, including LTC (which I like btw), and has Rootstock which will likely provide all ETH and similar coins offer, and it has Liquid which provides confidentiality like Zcash and Monero. Even on the base we will have Schnorr soon which will provide confidentiality and allow for 25-40% more transactions. And there are at least half a dozen other projects coming.
Those 2nd coins as they grow bigger will face all the same issues Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP already went through with the forks and drama. It's not going to be a straight path to success for any.
I actually think 5.8 million BTC users is over exaggerated. That study is taking a lot of assumptions. I think it's more like 4M. We actually don't know because of so many custodial services, like Coinbase. Many people I know 'hold' Bitcoin with such services.

"If there are the same number of people buying the same number of coin the price has to double."
That's not how it works, even if we remove all other factors (as you suggested).
Less new coins put pressure on the price upward, but halving wouldn't double the price if the demand was constant, even if the conditions were ideal and experimental. The formula is not linear. There are tipping points, below which the price doesn't change significantly, and beyond what it goes ballistic. This is true either way. For example a relatively small amount of hacked bitcoins sold at a loss (at any price) creates a huge drop in price.
As an example look at the mining fees. They don't just increase gradually, but are pretty much similarly the same and low all the way up to 100% block fullness, and then beyond 100% they suddenly go crazy beyond control.

If 2X happens, the fundamentals remain unchanged on 2X.
We just get more space for transactions, lower fees, which enable second layer solutions, which may have been priced out on the legacy chain. 
Developers who care about bitcoin won’t abandon bitcoin. Hopefully Core becomes compatible with 2X and continues to lead bitcoin development.
We may have proportionally to users less nodes in the future if 2MB blocks get filled, but at the same time in absolute numbers we will have more nodes because of more users. 
Egos will be hurt, but business and investors will be emboldened that Bitcoin can scale. Holders will enjoy the price increase.
We will create a narrative yet to be invented that allows us to save face so tweets like the above don’t feel embarrassing.
More likely, 2X will be delayed by 6 month or more, because segwit adoption relieves fee pressure, and businesses will want to avoid a potentially disruptive user experience. 
 A narrative yet to be invented will be constructed to save face why abandoning the agreement is OK. There is plenty to build on. Ex. the creation of Bitcoin Cash resulted in new unplanned market conditions because the split we were trying to avoid already happened.  In addition we have Bitcoin Gold incoming, which further complicates the landscape for users. A third 2X split would be too much for users.

There is no reason to panic and be overly dramatic.
They can't take over the project, because users can stop using the chain they don't like. It's as simple as that. They know this, and their interest lie in making users happy. Pissing off users would destroy their business.

I think the big new thing in 2019 will not be forks, ICOs, stable coins, or side-chains.
It will be institutional money coming in form of ETFs, funds, etc. Shortly after we will also see certain smaller countries starting to buy BTC as reserve currency to back-up their national currencies as well.
From a user perspective we will see the Lightning Network take off in a major way as user friendly LN mobile wallets come out early in 2019. Merchant and user adoption will skyrocket. We may see up to 50,000+ nodes running LN by the end of 2019.
Mining will take off in a major way again, as new vendors finally come out with their mining equipment, and as the price of Bitcoin grows in the second quarter of 2019. Miners will rush to mine as many bitcoins as possible at the 12.5BTC reward rate before it cuts to half of that in 2020.
We will also see base layer improvement proposals, but nothing will be implemented before 2020.

Segwit kicked in and some exchanges started batching. On top of this the usage is lower because we are not in a hype cycle. 
However these things only bought us a little time. Soon all these efficiencies will be used by increased demand again (if we are lucky). At that point we will need more new efficiencies like Shnorr sigs. Hopefully LN kicks in and high freqency users move to LN leaving more space for the ocassional BTC users. 
Eventually the Core scaling plan says we will need a blocksize increase that will be dynamic and safe to make sure the blocksize is not a limiting factor in growth. 
BCH and other similar to BTC alts are good for experimentation in the real world. They teach us which direction to take with BTC in the future without taking risks on Bitcoin. LTC is also good for small purchases because of the faster blocktime and ample blockspace.

In the future, you would hold some of your assets in BTC (not all), because bitcoin will be very stable because it's borderless and decentralized, and thus not influenced that much by the events of a single country or asset class. Bitcoin will slowly transform from a appreciating speculative asset to a gold like safe haven.
It is already happening to an extent within the crypto community. Many convert to Bitcoin when their more risky altcoins are too volatile.
Outside of the crypto community, bitcoin's ecosystem is already more decentralized in on/off ramps compared to traditional stocks. Traditional company stocks are held on a single exchange, and thus depend on the stability and reliability of that single operator. If an exchange stops trading your stock for any reason, you're out of luck. If one bitcoin exchange stops working you can still sell your BTC on dozens of other exchanges.
As people age, they will convert more and more of their assets into the very slowly appreciating but very stable Bitcoin, like they do with bluechip and government bonds.

!lntip 100 great question!
@_date: 2019-01-16 05:53:10
Most people use a few dollars in such custodial wallets to pay for tips, and yalls, etc. Nobody puts thousands of dollars into such wallets. Are they going to run away with $1-10K that people deposited in total? I don't know... seems like the worst kind of exit scam ever. It would not even be worth their time to develop the app.
But your warning is apt. Nobody should put more than $10 into such wallets in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:28:07
Well, he is suggesting the bubble will pop at 9K correcting to all the way down to $5.5K. We're in the $6K territory now. So if you believe his prediction, it makes sense to wait out at least $8K to sell and buy back at Today's prices.
However, nobody knows what will happen. It's possible there are multiple projects and events waiting to will push the price way beyond $10K, and some models predict that the bubble will only pop in the $30-40K range, correcting back all the way to $10K.
Once the B2X fork cleared out, the winning chain (I predict Bitcoin Core) will skyrocket, because there are a bunch of people sitting on the sidelines waiting out what will happen. Also, lots of people will sell the minority chain buying the majority chain putting extra buy pressure on the majority chain.
Right after the B2X fork we will have multiple events pushing the price up: Rootstock going on main net, Core announcing upgrade hard fork plans that may include a scripting language upgrade, ETF, and major retailer support (Amazon?).
I think the upsides are much bigger than the risks at this point. We're still in a bull market and will remain so for a few months.
However, there will be issues. I predict a major hack (like Bitfinex), major government crackdown/regulation plan by an important country like the USA, altcoin pump, and another hostile fork attempt. Two of these at the same time will trigger a bear market for years. Bitcoin will consolidate at $10-12K or even lower.
Then around 2020, things start to get resolved. Lightning network starts serving millions of people. Halving reduces miner rewards, but the fees are already more than covering the loss. Bitcoin becomes a household name outcompeting many smaller names like Samsung Pay or even Wester Union, and starts to be compared on equal grounds with brands like PayPal or AMEX. Smaller banks will start to offer crypto services, like private key storage, and crypto based collateralized loans. It will be normal to be able to buy Bitcoin at bank branches, like we can buy gold now for a fee. Dozens of countries will accept Bitcoin as official currency (like Japan does now). This is the point when Bitcoin starts to grow in value again, slowly but steadily into the $100K+ zone.

Not necessarily leads to unemployment. This is an old adage. Countries with lower spending velocity do not have higher unemployment. With less spending and economic activity we do improve quality of life in many ways, which is the more relevant metric to look at. Would you rather live in a city where you spend 3 hours in traffic each day to get 20% more pay? Most people would rather choose no traffic and lower pay. Also, prices of basic goods can fall if there is less pressure for resources, thus you need less money to buy them. These things balance each other out.
Bitcoin still serve as investment even when you're holding it. For example you can put into a safe smart contract that fuels an automated business.

If we keep only 10% or less of the hash power the difficulty readjustment will take 20-40 weeks instead of the normal 2. It also means for 5-10 month we will get a block only every 100-200 minutes instead of the normal 10. It would also mean that the fees will go really high. People who want to sell their coins will be willing to outbid anyone else and pay 100$+ to get their transaction in the next block. Even if they get in they will have to wait 1-2 days for the exchanges to get the required 6 confirms. The network will become almost unusable and thus the price may drop and thus we get even less hashing power, so we may never get to the readjustment. 
The same is true for the other chain. If they don’t get the 90% they will have the same problem. 
Everything will be decided in the first few hours in my opinion.

I don't have to use exchanges and I don't have to deal with users, but then I can also stop using Bitcoin altogether, which makes segwit an upgrade I can't disregard if I want to continue using BTC.
I do agree with your counter argument, but it's still not two fundamentally different situations. It's fundamentally the same.
For the record, I do support Segwit, and I don't support 2X, because it's unnecessary in this form at this point. However, this painting your opponent as the 'devil' tactic deployed by NO2X folks is unfair, and not even effective. In my opinion it's counter productive, because it divisive and shifts the discussion from technical argument to personal attacks.

BTC-1 is open source as well, like Core. Anyone can join and contribute. Core changed bitcoin with Segwit in a way that you could not opt out of as well, even though it's backward compatible for the most part. For example, when exchanges and users will start giving you segwit addresses to send to, you won't be able to not use segwit if you happen to disagree with it. So it's not quite different at all.

If you run your own full node with outbound ports open you help the network propagate blocks. You can also verify if the coins people send you are legit on the chain you support. But it doesn’t really force anyone to do anything. Miners can fork away and disregard your node by design of the Bitcoin network.
It’s all about the incentives the miners receive. The best way to support the chain of your choice is to split your coins and dump the coin you oppose and buy the coin you support. Also, buy the coin you believe in with USD.

Some of them have segwit. But not all. For example BCH doesn’t and would require a contentious fork to implement something that allows for LN. I say it’s contentious because a large part of the BCH community doesn’t want anything to do with LN, so it may be a split to BCH classic and BCH.

So, basically I can refuse to do business with the exchange that doesn't send me bitcoins on my chain, and the exchange can refuse to receive coins from miners who are on a different chain too. So basically if most users running a node refuse to do business on the 'wrong' chain, then we have an effect. Thanks for clarifying. It makes sense.

Get BTC for 10% of your savings. If BTC goes 10x, you double your savings. If it falls 50% you have lost little. This will minimize your worries about missing out and losing a significant chunk of your savings. The 10% may not be the right percentage for you. If you're young you can increase it.

Take your own advice and make real and good arguments if you have them, because your arguments currently are 'shitty' too (to use your own language). 
1. It doesn't matter who made the code change suggestion, or how long it took them to develop it. It's an appeal to authority fallacy to suggest that something is correct or incorrect because of certain person or a group is saying that.
2. It's wrong to say that it's a corporate takeover, hostile, maliciously written, etc. It's just an emotionally charged argument, which is again another fallacy.
If the suggested code change is bad, only argue based on technical aspects. Argue with research, numbers, reason, logic. Leave out any politics, emotions, conjecture, etc. because they muddy the waters, and make it harder for people to make clear headed rational decisions.
It's counter productive to be emotional about the issue, because it makes it feel like you don't have rational arguments, and thus you are forced to resort to lower quality argumentation. It tunes people against the cause you're defending.

So they ARE full right? Because for the longest time we could not even admit that, right? :)
Now we are saying that’s a good thing. Sure, but the time when mining fees will run out is a long time away. And we need more capacity now for regular transactions, not to mention lightning and rootstock. 
I’m no S2X supporter, but I can see where they are coming from. We need a gradual block size increase like now, don’t you think? Or shall we keep bitcoin play money for the current few hundred thousand fans, and let the rest the crypto market serve the world?
I also understand the need to keep the blockchain small, but if you look at ethereum, they have a huge blockchain and still have a bunch of nodes securing it. A slightly larger chain is not going to kill the node count. I know I can handle 1.1MB blocks this year and 1.2 next and so on. Such a gradual change would surely not kill bitcoin. Staying on 1 however seems like a big risk at this point.

They didn't say they won't support Bitcoin after the fork. They said they will not support the minority chain, only the majority chain whichever it may be.


It is expected Bitcoin Core to be the majority chain, because it will have a higher market price (based on BT2/BTC valuation), thus more miners, and thus more accumulated work, even though more miners are signalling for B2X at this time.
Thus, it is expected that Bitpay will support Bitcoin, not B2X (also called Segwit2x, or BC2).

No need. Lightning will have more decimal places, and allow for cheap micropayments. You can settle when needed on the blockchain by rounding up to a satoshi.
Having said that, there is probably a business model or attack vector that is related to collecting lots of round ups.
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:30:38
It’s not too weeks. It’s months or even a year depending how little hashpower remains on 1X. Basically the legacy chain as it is would die for all intents and purposes. We may not mine 6 blocks to send 1X coins to an exchange for days. Never mind the extreme fees it would create when there are 500,000 transactions lined up to be confirmed after 2-3 days. On the upside there will be few coins to sell, so the price would not drop too fast. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:36:43
They are a business. They don't know which chain will win, and they need to be ready to support both. Even if a huge number of people complain about S2X, the new chain may still win (even if the chance is very low), thus they can't really commit to call the core chain Bitcoin no matter what at this point.
On the other hand, they could singlehandedly decide the fate of S2X if they committed to call the core chain Bitcoin, and S2X something else, because they are big, and serve a huge number of customers.

That's not the case. The reason there are less transactions is because exchanges started batching, thus the outputs are increasing but the number of transactions are decreasing.

They won’t be rejected by all nodes. Some nodes will accept them. If major players like exchanges accept them they will be ok for a while. Private nodes won’t matter unless they complain to exchanges that they are not sending you the coin on the right chain. It all depends how many people will complain. If it’s a small minority they can survive it. If a big majority they will be forced to serve people on the chain they are demanding from them.
The issue is most people run spv wallets which are going to validate the 2X coins. Ex. copay wallets and bitcoin.com wallets, etc.

Exactly, even though I root for Core, I think it's not the end of Bitcoin if S2X manages to gain all these:
1. Majority hashpower
2. Majority economic full node support
3. Majority user support in form of buying S2X coins and recognizing it as Bitcoin
4. Gets recognized as Bitcoin by major businesses, like Overstock, Microsoft, etc.
If all that happens, it means Bitcoin has changed into something new, which may not be what I want, but it was the choice of the majority users and economic players, thus should be respected. I can continue respecting the Core chain and use it.
However, I don't think it's going to happen. In the first days the value of S2X will plummet comparing to Bitcoin and it will drive miners abandon S2X and continue mining Bitcoin, which will be the end of S2X. I don't think miners can hold out against people's wishes for long enough for all 4 criteria to happen.

Opening a wallet on your phone, ex. Jaxx, which supports multiple crypto currencies. Make sure you save your backup words safely.
Find an exchange to buy bitcoins. This depends on your country. Many people use Coinbase.com. Buy some bitcoins and then transfer them to your own phone wallet.

They have been increasingly anti-Bitcoin for over a year. They are pushing Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin to deceive people. Careful with these channels: bitcoin.com,  twitter. They are all controlled by one group and are all pushing a sometimes covert and other times overt anti-bitcoin agenda to promote their own altcoin.

I agree but it’s funny how the rhetoric so far was that it’s all about the tech and data and doesn’t matter who comes up with an idea. Now, we are saying even though 2MB is not a technical issue we still oppose it no matter how good of an idea it is. 
Anyway, I’m opposing 2MB on technical grounds. If we are to hard fork let’s do a more long term fix. Example: 10% max block size per year starting with Jan 2018. Also, let’s get in other improvements like shnorr sigs, and a refactor of segwit. This way we would have a long term solution, not just a relief for the next 6-8 month.

Well, yes, let's hope the price is indeed 1/3rd, but we can't be sure. Theoretically traders could switch valuing S2X more if the majority of bitcoin economy (meaning businesses) start calling S2X Bitcoin. It's going to be war! We will see who is willing to make financial sacrifices  to save an idea. I certainly hope Core wins! It would be a win for businesses on the long term too.

This event will test the foundational theories of crytos in general. If 2x doesn’t go through and test the resilience of bitcoin there will always be uncertainty about big players subverting bitcoin on the long run. I’m in the no2x camp, but I also welcome attacks because it tests and eventually strengthens bitcoin on the long term. As painful as it is, we have to go through this exercise at one point anyway. Let’s get over with it now. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 04:27:40
Agreed. Nowadays blocks are almost always full and often the number of transactions waiting to be confirmed go beyond 20,000, which means you need to wait a longer time for the transactions to be confirmed in a block. See the mountains of transactions building up regularly: [ You can always bump the fees, but some wallets don't have RBF, or people don't anticipate the sudden run-up in the fees and send their transaction without RBF in the first place. No matter RBF, somebody who is not willing to or can't pay more will have to wait eventually.
More Segwit adoption will give us some capacity increase, but it seems adoption is leveling out just below 50%, and growth beyond it is very slow. [
Also Schnorr signatures will give us something like \~20% capacity increase, but it's probably more than a year away.
On-chain block size scaling should be done carefully though. A bump up to anywhere between 1.5MB to 2MB from the current 1MB base block size (without Segwit) is safe at this point, but 4MB or 8MB could be risky. We have seen some occasional propagation issues with other coins testing larger block sizes. Also, Ethereum is suffering because their blockchain is growing too fast, so nodes are struggling to keep up, you need a real beefy dedicated machine to run an ETH full node at this point.
Also, there is a benefit to significant fees. They provide a healthy transition to times when block size rewards become too small to generate enough profit for miners to keep mining and providing security. In less than 2 years we will have reward halving, and it means only BTC 6.25 will be rewarded per block. Currently fees provide 0.1-0.5 BTC per block. If we increase the block size slowly and keep the fees relatively significant, we could get the fees to be in the 0.3-1 BTC range compensating for some of the reward drop.
The Bitcoin Core development roadmap includes block size scaling besides the other mentioned developments. It's apparently getting ready or is ready if the network adoption starts to suffer in result of congestion. But I know it's not a fixed block size increase, it's a more dynamic and long term solution, so we don't have to hard fork many times.
In summary:
* From year: 2020, Base block: up to \~2MB, Average transactions per block: 5K, Reward: 6.25 BTC, Fees: \~0.75 BTC, Total: 7 BTC, Users: 2x, Price: 10x (according to Metcalfe law) = $40K
* From year: 2024, Base block: up to \~4MB, Average transactions per block: 10K, Reward: 3.125 BTC, Fees: \~1.5 BTC, Total: \~4.6 BTC, Users: up to 4x, Price: up to 100x = $400K
* From year: 2028, Base block: up to \~8MB, Average transactions per block: 20K, Reward: 1.5625 BTC, Fees: \~ 3 BTC, Total: \~4.6 BTC (note it stabilizes here with increased block size and stable relatively high fees), Users: 8x, Price: It's crazy to speculate at this point, as we are serving maybe 100M or so people, making BTC as important as some of the biggest currencies like the British pound or Yen.

No, it's likely B2X will be an altcoin, like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. It will have value and some miners will mine it, but it will be lagging behind in terms of technology over time, because it has virtually no developers.
Nobody knows how much they will be worth, but in the past, forks helped the original coin grow in value because the parts of the community that were infighting get their own chain, and progress can potentially happen on both chains without the other party holding it back.
For example in this specific case, if the miners who disagree with Core for any reason fork away, and mine on a different chain, they won't hold back a possible soft or hard fork on the original chain that will help Bitcoin improve. For example Bitcoin could gain smart contract abilities through the new Simplicity language, so it will match Ethereum's functionality directly on chain, as opposed to through Rootstock. We could also have a reasonable blocksize increase policy that is not a one off, but a gradual yearly increase, Shnorr signatures for privacy and efficiency, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:54:24
So, right now there are multiple exchanges that don’t recognize B2X and committed to core chain being BTC, many big ones make the name bitcoin dependent on hashrate, and several don’t want to promise anything.
Prepare your wallets. This is going to be about who has the deeper cumulative pockets in the first few days to buy their preferred coin, and dump the other chain’s coins at any price.

Well. Coinbase did say they will consider other factors. But they are in a difficult position. They have to follow what people want. And they won’t know what that is by anything that is easy to measure. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:27:36
Many reasons:
1. Larger community. More people hold and accept Bitcoin by at least a factor or more.
2. More robust network: Bitcoin is harder to attack because of high hashrate that can't be easily bought or created in any way, and because there are so many nodes validating transactions.
3. More liquid. Higher market cap gives a bigger variety of use cases, especially when you need to move large value, in the millions of dollars. You can sell and buy this much bitcoin on exchanges without moving the price significantly, thus losing much on the spread. More people can hold bigger value making the price more stable, and sort of the base currency all other alts are measured / traded against, even more so than USD.
4. Biggest and best developer community among all cryptos, which allows the development to be conservative (which is a value when it comes to money), creative (more people provide ideas and solutions), and steady (doesn't depend on one or two key personalities, like in Ethereum).
5. Good brand. When people refer to cryptocurrencies, they think Bitcoin first. Bitcoin is what is shown in most cases when cryptos are visualized (think magazine covers). Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has top of mind awareness. This is something that takes years to build, and very hard to overcome. For example, it doesn't matter if a better Cola came about Coca-Cola wouldn't be overthroned.
6. Lean and efficient architecture. Inspite of the huge number of transactions bitcoin processes for many years, the blockchain is still manageable compared to some other cryptos. At the same time Bitcoin allows for second layer solutions, that allow it to compete with more advanced cryptos adopting the best and proven ideas. For example segwit was tested on Litecoin first. RSK will allow determentistic contracts on Bitcoin like Ethereum has. Lightning Network will allow instantaneous, and confidential transactions, atomic swaps, etc., which will make it better than any other competing crypto at the moment.
7. Advanced infrastrcture. Bitcoin has a huge number of wallets, libraries, third party services, hardware solutions supporting the network. Other cryptos have some of it, but not all like Bitcoin. For example most BTMs only do Bitcoin. There are like a dozen BTC wallets for iOS in the App Store serviing various user needs, compared to ~2 LTC wallet including the multi-currency wallet (Jaxx).
8. The primary player will create even more acceptance and advantage over time, because when a company needs to integrate a crypto currency, they will choose the most important one to start with before moving on to other cryptos. On the other hand it also lays down the path for easier adoption for other cryptos.

One big issue with this plan: If the hostile takeover of the bitcoin brand is successful, it means the bitcoin experiment failed because one of the core properties of anti-fragility has been breached. People will lose trust in cryptos in general, thus the price of bitcoin and all alts will drop significantly for several months or even years. 
Eventually, Bitcoin (the original chain) and other chains will resurrect with new security models that will prevent this type of attack. Bitcoin will gain confidence again.
S2X will remain a small player in the crypto market.

RE: "Which do you think will have the higher value?"
Let's hope you're right, but just to play devil's advocate.
Is it not possible, that the chain that actually processes transactions within reasonable amount of time, with reasonable fees will be the more valuable, thus the 2x chain because of the 95% of miner support?
The legacy chain with 100+ minute blocks with extra-orbitant fees will be considered dead by some, and thus they will try to sell their btc for something else. Not necessarily for 2x coins either. This may make the price fall and if there are enough 2x buyers, the 2x coin can become more profitable to mine.
If this happens, the only thing we can do is change to a different hashing algo, or implement something like the EDA, and hope all players upgrade to this new version of BTC.

Look at this block:
With just 8% of segwit transactions in the block, we have a total of 4,203 transactions fitting into it.
Judging by this with a theoretical 100% segwit transactions, what is the maximum number of transactions that we can fit into a block given all is optimal?
Previously I thought the max is around 5,500 transactions, but seeing this large block, it feels like we should be able to fit many more, perhaps up to 10,000?
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:38:12
If you run a full node but you don’t use it to send and receive it’s less important for the purposes of enforcing the rules. 
Let’s say there is a fork created by miners that increases the mining reward to 100 BTC per block. Lets call it the ‘100’. 
At this point you can either accept the new rules or reject the new proposal. Practically how does accepting or rejecting work, besides expressing your views in social media?
If you accept and you run a full node you will make sure your full node is upgraded to run the forked ‘100’ code. When somebody sends you bitcoins you will watch if it arrives through your node and only if it did do you say: ‘thanks, I got it’. Otherwise you will claim you didn’t get the funds. 
If you reject the proposal you will not ‘upgrade’ your node, and keep running the good old code and when somebody sends you bitcoins you only say ‘thanks, I got it’ if they send it to you on the good old chain. Otherwise you claim you didn’t get it. By doing this, you are giving value to the old chain coins and giving no value to the ‘100’ chain coins. You are also forcing this valuation on the other party who wants to trade with you. 
If most economic players (active users of bitcoin) accept payments on the old chain, it won’t matter if there is a new chain. ‘100’ will become worthless or will hold significantly less value, like BCH, BTG, BTD and literally hundreds of other bitcoin forks that are worth anywhere between 0-10% of the real Bitcoin’s value.
Why is there a value to forks at all? Because a small minority of users believe in the fork being a legit successor of the blockchain and typically have a great economic incentive to keep the fork alive. For example the miners will buy the ‘100’ coins to give it value in hopes that people will start using it. But as soon as they stop buying it up it will start losing value.
In the case of BCH basically some miners didn’t want a second layer Lightning Network (LN) solution on Bitcoin because they were afraid the fees will go to LN node operators instead of miners. So, they created a fork which can’t run LN and increased the block size in hopes that all transactions will remain on chain and thus increasing their fee revenue. The problem for them was, the great majority ~90%+ users rejected the idea, because users don’t want a bigger blockchain which would make them lose control of the Bitcoin rules. They want to still enforce the Bitcoin rules themselves, and want instant transactions and much bigger scaling like what LN offers.
So, now that miners are realizing they are making peanuts on BCH on fees, because there are too few users, some will change strategy. 
Some opportunistic miners will put their efforts and funds into setting up large LN nodes routing most of payments and collecting fees on LN instead. When they realize this is a profitable endeavour, you will see lots of promotion for LN. There will be a tipping point somewhere in the near future when everything will be about LN.

Your Bitcoins in LN channels are the same as trucks but for financial services. It allows value to be transferred from one place to the other. It's a useful service as it facilitates trade, which in turn generates efficiencies in the marketplace.
For example, let's say person A has an excess of pencils, and person B needs a pencil so they can do engineering work. C can spend a transaction fee to open a Bitcoin LN channel to both A and B, and facilitate a payment between A and B, to improve the efficiency in the marketplace by moving value and thus allowing the pencil trade to take place. That trade allows both parties to be more efficient, better off, and thus generate value for the economy. Without Bitcoin C opening many channels to many different parties, A would not be able to send to B unless they open a channel themselves (or use a direct transaction) thus playing the role of C themselves.
Opening Bitcoin LN channels is like investing your Bitcoins to rend trucks, which can do a valuable service.
Whether the transaction is for buying stuff, or for reserving value it doesn't matter. Reserving value is an equally useful and valuable service, as it allows the time shift of frozen work to be unlocked at a later time when it's more efficient to use the funds. Maybe a real world example helps here too. Imagine you are a farmer. You have a excess of grains during harvest. You don't need to buy anything at this time, but soon you will need to buy fertilizer, gas, etc. to restart the farming season. If there was no money to store value you would have to deal with the hassle of storing the grains which carries the risk of rotting and being eaten by rodents, or exchange it immediately for gas and fertilizer, which also needs to be stored somewhere which takes up space and dangerous in large quantities.
Obviously you don't have to be a trucker or a farmer to take advantage of the above use cases. Bitcoin and LN gives you the same value in other areas of industry and life. You can be a person who is simply saving excess wealth earned during his early years for his retirement years. This is a huge service and very useful. It's not 'dishonest' to call such accumulation 'investment' in any way.
The difference between USD and Bitcoin is that you can move Bitcoins (especially on LN) around much easier and cheaper. While a wire transfer takes $30 and days across countries, and PayPal like services take a 3-5% cut, Bitcoin and especially LN transactions cost a few cents only. On top of that with Bitcoin you don't have the risk of chargebacks, or loss of funds due to confiscation or arbitrary bank or government rules. Thus, you need less insurance on your transactions too. With every BTC transaction you save tens of dollars. If somebody makes dozens of such transactions a month to pay freelancers or to buy supplies, they can save hundreds of thousands of dollars by using Bitcoin and LN. On a global such savings can be trillions of dollars yearly. This is the efficiency and the value the BTC network brings.

Part of the community believed the way to scale bitcoin quickly on the short term was to increase the block size from 1MB to 20MB, later 8MB, later 2MB. The intention was to reduce fees and open up bitcoin for more people. The dowside Core was putting forward is that bigger blocks increase the blockchain faster thus more people running full nodes will drop off which also means it's easier to hijack Bitcoin, and Core was right as you can see with the S2X fork. Nodes with real economic activity is now super important to make sure Bitcoin is not 'hijacked'.

Sure, but how do you know where is the high and where is the low. Sure, you can point it out retrospectively. But can you tell me where the next high or low will be? We can't even ballpark it.
The next high can be as low as 25K or as high as 250K. And the low after that may be 5K or 50K.
If you sell at 25K, thinking it's the top, and then the price climbs to 250K and then falls to 50K and you have to buy back, you lose 50% of your bitcoins.

There is a very high chance Bitcoin will stay number one and attract most investments, so that's a solid one. Invest as much as you can afford to potentially lose and not end up on the street. Also, do it soon, because the next bull run can start any time now within the next 20 months.
Now, regarding alts? There are literally thousands in the race for the top 2 to 10 positions. The competition is fierce and it's possible a currently unknown coin will top all other alts on the long run. So, truly, investing in alts at this point is like a casino. Some of them are safer with little upside, others are riskier with a big potential upside, but all of them are a gamble. If you must invest in an alt, choose the one that you think has the promise that best aligns with your values. That way, even if you don't win, you supported a project that is close to your heart.

Bitcoin will do it all:
* International digital gold. It's the biggest, most well known, most trusted, safest, most resistant, most decentralized crypto currency.
* Digital cash. This is already achieved through second layers and sidechains. You can already send bitcoin through the Lightning Network for a few satoshis, or even free in most cases. Many merchants accept it. According to Bitrefill only BTC on-chain and ETH transactions are higher than LN transactions. It is already more used than alts, and it's only getting started. You can use many LN wallets for this.
* Confidential cash. You can also use the Liquid sidechain to send bitcoin very fast, very cheaply and confidentially. It's virtually as safe as on-chain Bitcoin, and definitely safer than alts in general. You can use the Green wallet for this.
* Smart cash. You can create smart contracts and autonomous companies on-chain, on side-chains like Rootstock, or on the Lightning Network soon which will bring tokens and other smart functionality.
* Trust ledger. There is no network on Earth that is safer than Bitcoin to record a piece of information in a way that can not be erased or modified. This is an enormous untapped value of the network, that will one day play a huge role in society.
BCH has a potential as digital cash, and maybe even the other use cases, but it is magnitudes less safe for any of them, and it currently has no chance of being digital gold. However, BCH has huge competition in the form of dozens or even hundreds of coins, that all can do what BCH can and do it better. And there are new coins appearing every single month that are challenging alts. The alts in the top 10 ranking have been coming and going every few years. None of them could even hold on to position 2 or 3 consistently for very long, let alone challenge Bitcoin.
BCH is not in a fight for survival with Bitcoin as their proponents are trying to portray the situation. That's wishful thinking. BCH is fighting to stay in the top 5 or top 10 with dozens of alts that all have ecosystems that match BCH's.
Betting on alt coins is truly like playing roulette. Nobody knows which one will get lucky. Any of them could get a short term boost from a wealthy individual. And most of them are non-winning bets. None of them are long term safe bets.
To answer your question, why does Roger thinks BCH is the true version of Bitcoin? The same reason why Craig Wright thinks BSV is the true version of Bitcoin. These alts don't offer anything that other coins don't offer. The only way you can market these alts is if you piggyback on Bitcoin. They are trying to confuse investors so their own huge investments keep their value. Fundamentally, they are NOT crazy. The concept of Bitcoin allows for such interpretations. Bitcoin is what YOU believe is bitcoin. But if you're in the minority with your belief, you're wrong, because other people won't accept your 'bitcoin' as bitcoin according to their own interpretation. There may come a time when YOU will have to defend the concept of Bitcoin by accepting or not accepting a forked Bitcoin that some outside power will try to force on you. It will be up to your ideals, morals, and wishes.
BCH however from the very beginning was NEVER created as 'true' Bitcoin by Bitmain. From the beginning they announced it as an airdrop, a fork of Bitcoin. They never claimed it is Bitcoin. Bitmain created BCH it in order to have a SHA256 coin that they can mine with the energy consumption hack they came up with, that gave them an upside in the mining wars, since Bitcoin was blocking this hack from them as a side effect of Segwit activation. Segwit was not designed to eliminate this hack, but it was a welcome side effect. Bitmain had way too much power in mining, reaching beyond 50%. Such centralization is unsafe for Bitcoin, and having that hack would've guaranteed that they can grow even bigger.
BCH had no use, so Bitmain had to buy and mine it like crazy to keep the value up so their miners can take advantage of the hack. So Bitmain amassed a huge amount of BCH which was getting heavy. What's the point of owning 10% of an alt, if you're the only one who keeps the value up. They knew they can never sell it or it will crash the price.
At the same time Roger was fighting the Bitcoin Core developers, because he wanted to raise the Bitcoin block size as soon as possible, ensuring he can run his businesses like satoshi dice which require tons of cheap transactions on the network. He truly believed that Bitcoin's decentralization is OK to risk as long as Bitcoin's transaction could and consequently blockchain size will grow to any size. This in his mind would've increased Bitcoin's value and thus he could profit quickly. Many other short term thinkers bought into this idea too. They neglected the reality that the main value of Bitcoin comes from it being resistant to governments, and thus decentralization is more important than quick transaction growth.
It became clear that the block size increasing is not happening, because the majority of the Bitcoin community understood the complex risks, and was OK to grow slow and safe. At this point since all Bitcoin holders already had BCH, Roger embraced BCH which had the desired larger blocks, and started the 'true' Bitcoin narrative to market it.
Claiming BCH is Bitcoin is surreal, because it wasn't even started as a Bitcoin, but as an alt from the beginning. By this logic any and all Bitcoin forks (there are hundreds) could call themselves as 'true' Bitcoin, because they share the same block history. In this scenario which alt gets to be called 'Bitcoin' if all you need is a shared block history? It's a warped thinking, but it doesn't matter.
We can listen to his arguments, and then WE can decide what is Bitcoin. Nobody else can force anything on us.

Market cap is very inaccurate measure of anything really. While the price would be a good indication of general market sentiment, the multiplier of the number of coins messes it up in a major way.
There are so many factors that also matter that should be considered. For example if you have two coins with the same market cap, should they be considered to be of the same 'importance' even though:
* One has 10x higher security?
* One is traded 10x more?
* One is 75% pre-mined?
* The majority of coins are in a few hands?
* One has 30% coins lost and thus out of circulation?
* One has a central single point of control and thus failure?
* One is used 5x more in everyday transactions?
* etc.
Market cap is one metric out of dozens that should determine value, and the weight of these metrics depends on an individual's preferences. It's not universal. One may care about long term metrics, another short term. One may care about anti-fragility, another cares about current use.
The only thing that is a good indication of value or importance is long term increase of value of a single coin. If it's consistently rising for years, it's more important than another coin that is less well performing.
BTC have risen from cents to tens of thousands in 10 years. Gold has risen from $20 to $1,500 in 100 years. These can be considered hard money.
USD and all other fiat is losing value consistently. Weak money.
Alts are too young, so we don't know. But for example BCH is trading lower than it was shortly after its creation in dollar terms, and got destroyed in BTC terms. Basically same category as fiat. Other alts like ETH and XRP may be semi-hard moneys. Time will tell.

Thanks for this addition. Yes, of course we still have to trust Liquid the sidechain, which is a step down from Bitcoin on-chain security, but still a step up from alts or from single exchange trust. It's likely that one exchange screws you over in some form eventually, but 11 out of 15 is very unlikely to happen, but it can. Coordinated government action could force action to be taken by 11 out of 15 exchanges, which is why you would still keep most of your funds on-chain, and use Liquid for trading or day-to-day operations that require fast and cheap transactions.

Every 10 minutes one bitcoin block is created. That block's current maximum file size is 1MB (plus segwit data stored separately). This size allows for a certain number of transactions. If there are more transactions than the blocks can handle the users can pay higher transaction fees to get priority over other transactions.

Simplicity is a new smart contract language, that will make Bitcoin more scriptable, like Ethereum for example.
However, this language is reportedly better because it fixed Ethereum's main issue, which is the difficulty to prove safety of the code, so people don't lose funds, and business don't go broke because of a smart contract bug.
For this to happen on Bitcoin we would need to soft or hard fork Bitcoin.

I think over time there will be a very small (1% or less) valuation difference between BTC and SBTC. BTC could be more valuable because it doesn't carry the risk of the federation, and is much more widely accepted. SBTC could be more valuable because it is faster, and the fees will be lower to transfer. Also, can be used in the smart contracts running on RSK, so it may be seen as value. If the Bitcoin fees go high ($10+), for small amounts it will make sense to stay on SBTC for everyday uses, if its relatively widely.

So your whole counter argument stands on literally one thing: “you cannot buy stuff with it”. 
And this is NOT true. Go to overstock.com, which is just one of the tens of thousands of merchants who have been accepting bitcoin for years. You can buy anything from bedsheets to iPhones. And they don’t even sell it all for USD, but keep part of the revenue in Bitcoin, so you can’t even make the argument that Bitcoin is immediately sold tor dollars.
Now if you need to buy from a merchant that doesn’t accept it, just exchange your bitcoin to USD on one of the hundreds of exchanges and you are good to go. Or just do it automatically by using one of the bitcoin debit cards. You would be in the same place as if you held your funds in Euros for example.
Are the Euros worthless for you because the banks exchange it to USD when the debit card is used in the USA? Of course not. 
If you buy anything from a non US dollar using country your USD is immediately sold for the local currency because USD is ‘worthless’ there, so a transitional currency doesn’t mean it’s actually useless.
Bitcoin can be considered as a foreign currency. It has the same properties for commerce. And has all the long term benefits of gold of being country independent. And it has the big value commerce benefits of low transfer cost that only a highly liquid crypto offers.
Now that your core argument is destroyed where do you go from here?

3. Now that btc1 nodes are increasing, it's all about nodes with economic activity, absolute node count doesn't matter
4. In the near future when btc rich folks have the most ecomic activity on btc1 nodes, what is going to be the new argument? Why will nodes with most economic activity and majority hashpower won't matter?

He thinks that the real identity of Satoshi makes a difference to hodlers? Nope. All we need to know is in the code. Such a pathetic argument against Bitcoin if there ever was one. At least it's something new, and not a rehash of other typical noob contra arguments, like 'it's based on thin air'.
This guy, like many other rich people who derive their self worth from their money is pissed that he missed the boat on 2012-13 bitcoin prices, and thus want Bitcoin to burn, because he will feel better about himself not investing. His opinion is not based on some careful consideration of Bitcoin's value proposition and its opportunity in the wold. It's literally just a wish founded in cognitive dissonance. It's not worth listening to such people's opinion.
The funny thing is, even if Bitcoin went to zero Tomorrow, he would've still missed the huge 10 year investment opportunity Bitcoin offered. The only solution for him to calm his nerves is to get in on Bitcoin now, and still profit handsomely in the coming years. But the his over inflated ego won't let him.
If he's sure Bitcoin will go to zero, why not short it with a $ 100M and make an absolute killing? He's not stupid, he knows he's talking shit, and he would get wrecked on the next pump.

The correlation between the number of users and the value of the network is quadratic. If you double the number of users you quadruple the value of the network.
* 2x users = 4x value
* 3x users = 9x value
* 4x users = 16x value
* 5x users = 25x value
* etc.
You can see the approximate growth of number of users roughly by looking at the number of total addresses that has more than 0 btc on them. I'm not saying that the number of addresses correspond to the number of users, far from it. There are many users with multiple addresses, and there are many users who are shared by one address (because of custodians like Coinbase).
* Right now there are only about 15M bitcoin addresses has more than $1.
* A year and half ago there were about 5M. So we have a growth of about 3x, resulting in a price increase of about 10x.
* 2.5 years ago there were about 2.5M. And the value checks out accordingly as well.
Somebody should run a more detailed analysis correlating number of bitcoin addresses to price, but this rough analysis already gives a strong indication that the quadratic relationship is solid.

* Based on Bitcoin's tech / stack
* Native currency is Bitcoin
* You can move Bitcoin and pay fees in Bitcoin
* Operated by top exchanges
* You can run full node, you can run wallets
* Supports assets, like Tether for USD
* As an issuer of an asset you have a key that allows you to either create more (if the asset allows it) or delete the token, or transfer over the ownership of the token (like when you sell a tokenised company)
* Confidential, the values and type (ex. Bitcoin, asset like Tether, etc.) of the transactions are encrypted, only sender and recipient knows
* Can do trust-less swaps, for example: Bitcoin to Tether

Well. Look at Tether. It is supposed to be 1:1 to USD, yet it is usually hovering a bit above it because the utility of the Tether is better than USD.
There is a fixed exchange rate peg between BTC and sBTC by the federation, but on the free market we can exchange it at a different rate if we want to.
You would use sBTC for micropayments that are running on a deterministic contract that can’t be written on BTC. I don’t know what that is but there are probably use cases that can’t be done on BTC only on EVM.

Once the GUI will be sorted out it will be easy to use.
A new user would open a wallet, select a provider like Coinbase (to buy coins and to set up a channel), fund the account with $10, and they are done. They will be able to start sending and receiving up to $10. Then once they received $10 through LN or old bitcoin address, the app will suggest to increase your limit to $20, and thus you will be able to send and receive up to $20.
(The limits will only be present for instant LN transactions, you would be able to send and receive bitcoins on old addresses normally.)
Transactions will confirm immediately. You will be able to send to any LN address, old bitcoin address, or even a lightcoin address (and other chains via atomic swapping). It will be more user friendly than wallets Today in many ways.
All the complexities will be hidden for the user.
If you go into advanced you will have various expert options, like "settle channel", "change channel", "set up channel", "set up atomic swap offer", etc. but most people won't need to change the defaults.

Mining does represent the will of part of the community, just not all. Some community members are supporting 2x, many others do not.
There are multiple levels of checks and balances within the bitcoin network.
1. Mining prevents double spending. But mining doesn't dictate the code. Hypothetically, even if all miners in the world were to mine a chain that nobody is interested in, it will have no use or value at all.
2. The code however is dictated by people who run validating nodes, and wallets connecting to those nodes, because they vote to accept the transactions as legit, and the tokens as valuable. Code is secured by nodes.
Miners keep rogue users in check. Users keep rogue miners in check.

I just started running a brand new 0.15.0.1 node with forwarding port open. I have 18-19 connections at any time. I'm hoping this will help support the network.
However, I don't know if this is going to help against S2X at all. If they have majority hash power, and they have enough nodes to distribute blocks efficiently, they can disregard my node altogether.
My node would only count if my word had any weight when I complain to an exchange that their supposed bitcoins never arrived to me, because I'm on the Core chain, and not on the S2X chain. But if I'm a minority of their customers, they will care for the majority and not me.
The outcome of the S2X fork will all depend on which chain is seen more valuable by traders and buyers, and how long can the pro S2X miners can stay on a losing chain. 
If Core wins:
1. Majority will think Bitcoin is proven to be anti-fragile against the biggest 'attack' in its history = Bullish
2. Minority will think Bitcoin is unable to upgrade = Bearish
If S2X wins:
1. Majority will think Bitcoin is able to evolve, great for major commercial use = Bullish
2. Minority will think Bitcoin (and all other coins) can be hijacked = Bearish
Either way the majority will feel bullish and thus the winning chain will go up in value. Hodlers of coins on both chains, interested to make a profit will win either way.
Please correct me if my understanding is incorrect.

If the majority of the bitcoin ecosystem of miners, merchants, payment services, exchanges, etc. along with their users agree to switch to B2X and accept it as Bitcoin, then they managed to convince all these people and companies that they are capable to run Bitcoin, and consequently it is likely the same ecosystem will be ready to adapt other reasonable code changes too. However, they can't force any crazy code change on anyone. So, they won't really get any special powers at all. For example they would not be able to raise the 21M limit, or increase the mining rewards to come in twice as fast, etc. because users will likely reject the idea because it devalues their investments.
However, at this moment the B2X 'team' hasn't demonstrated much ability to be a good guardian of the code:
* They only have a part-time developer, who works on a competing coin at the same time. He's probably paid for his services, and not working on the code voluntarily out of love of the project, unlike many Core developers.
* Admittedly 'they' are struggling to adopt Core's 0.15 latest version of Core code, and thus likely work with 0.14, which is already outdated.
* Core had to point out an error in the implemented change, which was just changing a constant 1MB to 2MB.
* They seem to be struggling to implement sane replay protection that the BCash team could pull of without a problem. They implemented something and then pulled it out because it was pointed out by Core that it will break future stuff. Not sure what is the latest...
* No announced future plans to improve Bitcoin.
* No guarantees of any kind of solid stable team, or any serious sign of community support.
Barry Silbert (DCG) and team could convince most miners to signal their readiness and willingness to mine B2X. He probably promised them investments. We have to see if it's enough to offset mining B2X at a loss for long enough.
I think it's likely users will vote for Bitcoin (Core) with their wallets, and nodes. We will have a situation where BTC will be worth $6K and B2X $1K (based on the futures), so we are talking about a loss of ~$20M per day for miners to stay on B2X. How long will they have to mine at a loss to gain confidence of all companies and users that they are the new Bitcoin? It may take days or even weeks... and may never happen so it may be all for nothing. Is DCG willing to put down this money to offset the losses even if people are not accepting B2X as Bitcoin at the end? Big gamble, and for what? They won't have any special powers over users even with the Bitcoin name...

Rogue activity is trying to play the system. For example double spend, or increase mining reward. It's going against the social contract and code in place.
Sybil attack with 100 nodes representing one identity is still just one identity. We don't count the numbers, but the economic activity the nodes represent. The node of an exchange represents all its users willing to do business on that node.

It doesn't prove that the majority of transactions are outgoing transactions, because that's not the case! The majority of transactions before and now are with 2 outputs, just entities using Bitcoin one to one. Your argument makes no sense.
Transactions dropped because of many reasons, one of the main being batching, so exchanges can now send many transactions with one actual transaction. Batching doesn't prove that there are less 1-1 transactions, it is unrelated to it. If indeed 1-1 is less, there is a different reason for it, but you can't prove that by looking at an aggregate of all transactions that includes batched transactions. I can't believe I have to explain this. It's like basic set theory. :D
It's not a speculation that all cryptos have dropped in transactions. You can see numbers here: 
BTC down 50%, ETH down 40%, LTC down 70%, BCH down 70%.

@_date: 2018-04-11 01:23:18
No, that doesn't mean that people are not using it as a currency. It means some of the previous transactions that used to be separate are now batched and thus reduce the overall transaction volume. The great majority of other transactions are still simple with 2 outputs (people are using it).
Well, LN is not making a huge dent, but it is starting to. Also, you can't see how many transactions are done on LN. You can open a channel and make hundreds of tiny transactions without touching the main chain using just 10,000 satoshi. The volume of funds isn't necessarily an indicator of the number of transactions.
Also, all cryptos are down in transactions because we're in a valley of interest currently. It's not a Bitcoin specific trend.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:54:57
The tulip mania argument again? It's been proven to be an incorrectly retold historical event. Never happened. Also, what bubble pops over and over while trending upwards overall for 10 years?

I think the Chinese miners ARE good to have in Bitcoin's ecosystem. They are an important element in Bitcoin's decentralization. Having various parties involved in the ecosystem even if they are in a non-democratic country IS what decentralization means. People have to understand and accept that decentralization includes players form North Korea, from the dark web, from the most unlikely and undesirable (from your perspective) places. Some of these players may be seen as bad on the short term, but it's very good on the long term. If all miners were in developed democratic countries, it would be much easier for the USA to order them to be shut down or something. But once you have miner outside of the USA's direct influence, Bitcoin becomes truly anti-fragile.

@_date: 2018-04-10 21:23:13
YES, it's mostly batching, and NO outputs are not a better measurement at all. Here is why:
Imagine you are an exchange and want to pay 100 customers.
Before batching you sent 100 transactions, each with 2 outputs one for the customer and one for the change address. Thus you have 200 outputs in total.
After batching you send 1 transaction, with 101 outputs, 100 for the customers and 1 change address.
Thus, as you can see not only the transaction numbers can drop significantly (100-&gt;1) and drastically, but also the outputs (200-&gt;101) will nearly halve for every batched transaction. You only need one or two batched transactions in every block and you're freeing up a bunch of space and reducing transaction numbers significantly. If you look at any random block you will see a bunch of batched transactions. It's very common to see 10-20 outputs, and its not uncommon to see 80-100 outputs within one transaction.
On top of this, we now have lightning and lots of people are using it surprisingly a this very early stage. Bitrefill reported tons of live transactions and now services like coincards.ca and others accept LN payments too. None of these BTC payments show on the blockchain relieving the main chain from thousands of transactions a day.
Both effects will increase in the near future, so we may see even emptier blocks.

@_date: 2018-04-08 21:22:32
The chart is not a true reflection of usage, because:
* Batching introduced by exchanges reduced the number of transactions significantly. Even if you look at outputs they dropped by half too because you only have one change address for a single transactions that represents a number of 'sends'.
* Lots of BTC transactions are now done over LN, which is not reflected on-chain. Bitrefill for example reports an increasing number of LN transactions, a few weeks ago they reported they received over $10,000 in payments.
* Lots of BTC transactions are done over 3rd party services. For example earn.com pays to coinbase accounts directly off-chain. This wasn't the case before.
Regarding your video, BCH zero confirm is OK to risk for small amounts, but it's not safe for large amounts on either of the chains. BTC has literally the same features as BCH in this regard. You can do the same zero confirm on BTC too if you wish. Literally nothing stopping you. Don't bring up RBF, because RBF can be detected, and you can opt to send without it on BTC.

LTC already had a pump in the last few months becoming no.4 for a significant amount of time. 
LTC is in a very good strategic position. It shares code base with Bitcoin and keeps up to date with it too. Note like BCH for example that branched away. So any Bitcoin development will benefit LTC too. LTC even has its own LN. And at the same time LTC has a different algo and has a faster blocktime with more transaction capacity, so it’s not competing with bitcoin yet has some advantage over Bitcoin if you are willing to take the security tradeoffs.
And Bitcoiners like LTC because it’s a real world test ground for BTC tech providing us with invaluable learnings and helping Bitcoin implement new code with even greater confidence.
BTC and LTC are in a good symbiotic relationship.
BCH however is a parasitic coin, feeding of Bitcoin’s brand. Yet, it also provides some insights for Bitcoin unintentionally. BCH is testing ideas in the real world that Bitcoin can learn from on the long term. If nothing else it confirms what definitely not to do.

I think you are misunderstanding what Bitcoin maximalism is. It doesn’t mean that a person believes in and fights for Bitcoin no matter what. 
It means they believe that network effects will increasingly benefit a single winning chain and thus all value, development and usage will be on this chain. And they happen to believe that this one chain is Bitcoin. Not because they are necessarily fans of Bitcoin, but just because of reality.
It doesn’t mean Bitcoin is best in a certain area. It just happens to be best overall because of the already established network effects. Other coins may be faster or cheaper, but nobody cares because nobody uses those. 
There are Bitcoin maximalists who are Ethereum fans. It’s not mutually exclusive. You can be an internet maximalist, yet be aware that other international networks could offer different and even better features but they will never take hold because the internet’s network effect is too strong at this point. 
I’m a Bitcoin maximalist and I happen to be a fan of Bitcoin too, but I’m also interested in other coin tech and their experiments.
I would not mind to accept payment in other than Bitcoin, but nobody ever offered anything else but Bitcoin and even if I received some alt, I would shapeshift it immediately to Bitcoin. 
So, no. It’s not like religious fundamentalism. There is no blind trust in Bitcoin and irrational devotion no matter what. It’s just a belief based on observation of similar systems.

When you're buying Bitcoin, you're not just buying a random speculative asset to make a quick buck. What you're buying is much bigger and much more valuable than any other asset available. It's not about gains, or even store of value.
In fact, this will sound insane to the uninitiated, but what you're buying is more precious than anything else in the world. You're buying **freedom** for yourself and others. You're buying freedom from tyrannical governments, freedom from wars paid by devalued currencies, freedom of opinion and expression, freedom to freely trade with other free humans.
When you buy Bitcoin, you're directly supporting an asset that underlies a philosophical and political movement focused on the idea of liberty and pursuit of happiness, the great ideals of the United States and the free world in general, which are in danger of being completely corrupted. Every time you spend a dollar on Bitcoin, you make Bitcoin stronger, and make it live another day longer. You're feeding the flame of hope for a free society where people can do what they want without others forcing their will on them, as long as they are not hurting others.
Some people know this rationally, and thus work on Bitcoin and buy Bitcoin like nobody's business, putting their savings into it to keep the flame alive. Others know it instinctively, and may not be able to explain the reasons why they are drawn to this asset like to no other. People have an emotional attachment to gold for similar reasons, but gold also has a negative overtone, because it is also a symbol of opulence demonstrated by dictators and tyrannical rulers who are antithetical to the ideals of a free society. Bitcoin on the other hand is cyberpunk, grassroots, bottom up, and pure in heart.
@_date: 2019-05-01 12:09:43
Well, the issue is in order to have a very reliable LN wallet that you operate fully, which will always be able to send to any other node, you need to open at least a couple of channels. One channel only won't be reliable enough. So for example if you want a sending capacity of $10 to virtually any node, you need to commit at least $50 in 5 channels. And you also need to manage incoming capacity if you want to receive LN payments, which means you should keep your channels open even when they are depleted, which is not a big deal.
Right now, custodial wallets work great for small amounts, because those nodes are extremely well connected so the payments are virtually guaranteed to succeed both ways. But you're giving up trust, which is not a big deal if you only keep a small amount on your wallet at all times for tiny payments for reading articles or tipping, etc.
For example, if you're a merchant, you could use a custodial wallet, and every end of the day you could send the revenue to yourself, so you are not risking it with the custodian. Kind of similar to using bitpay or coinbase merchant accounts.
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:50:41

@_date: 2019-05-14 18:40:33
I think put it all on red.
Nobody knows, but chances are Bitcoin is a safer bet among the ultra volatile cryptos.
Last time alts boomed because they were perceived cheap costing a buck or so each. Now they are in the hundreds. They don’t feel cheap anymore. And there is so many of them.
Bitcoin this time is offering many of the features the alts promised in the past. LN solves speed, fees, and privacy all at once. RSK solves smart contracts. Liquid solves scaling. What else there is for alts this time?
I think bitcoin maximalism is growing as people accept reality that network effects consolidate value in less and less coins over time, eventually consolidating everything into one coin. Ant thag is likely going to be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:48:38
Bittersweet. The more users of all kinds, the stronger the network. But I get what you're saying.
Many of us non spammers have non-RBF transactions stuck with significant 50 sat/byte fees because of the unexpected rise of fees. The fee market is eliminating real world users too, trying to do things Bitcoin was invented to do, like transferring value between individuals and businesses.
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:01:38
The blocksize won't be increased unless Bitcoin is collapsing due to high fees, or unless the internet connection and processing power of average computers increases several fold.
It would be great if we didn't have to hard fork bitcoin, instead people would start using second layer solutions like LN, Liquid and RSK. All three are much faster, much cheaper, and effectively bitcoin. They could serve all the needs of everyday transactions, smart contracts, etc. while the first layer would act to only secure them, and not carry any everyday transactions at all, unless they are of very high value, over thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:37:56
Yes. But it’s just a larger block. It doesn’t mean it doubles transaction capacity. As I said earlier the transaction capacity will only increase by 40% max unfortunately. Maybe under specific conditions in the future we may go beyond that, but not 2x.

@_date: 2019-05-23 17:10:03
Yeah, I agree with your argument. The tradeoff will still be there, so other coins will serve other markets. My bet is only LN and Liquid. I think Liquid will take off like crazy once there are a few wallets supporting it.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:42:50
Privacy is not a good example because Bitcoin can do it already through LN for example. But there will be coins that bring a different risk / feature combination that Bitcoin can’t cooy because it has a different philosophy. But even then, sidechains can bring those features on top of Bitcoin. Take scaling for example. Some coins are OK to risk centralization in order to achieve high transaction capacity. Bitcoin won’t do it, but if you don’t mind a bit of risk because of centralization because you are not holding the coin long term but using it for daily activity you could start using something like Liquid sidechain and still use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:33:40
Because at any point the mountain of transactions could start growing which means your low fee transaction could get stuck for a long time. Thus people are paying high fees to avoid that occurrence.

Yes. Of course. But will the base layer be enough to handle the side chains and second layers when a billion people are using it? Of course not. And when you have 100x better computers and internet we can handle a larger block size. It won’t compromise the number of nodes.

Well, you could have high fees for a while, while people are slowly forced to migrate to another coin. At one point network effects start to favour the other coin. In this situation, even when Bitcoin fees fall back to reasonable levels because of reduced usage, it won't matter because the other coin becomes the beneficiary of the maximalist effect.
It's a long shot but this is a possibility, not? And if the Bitcoin community recognizes the signs early on, we may decide that a modest blocksize increase is less of a risk than letting the project fail.

 Wise decision. You can thank yourself in 10 years. 
The point of a cold wallet is to ensure your private key is generated and stored on a device that has no internet connection, while allowing you to sign transactions that can be transmitted over the internet.
Make sure you back up your seed words so you can recover your funds if the hardware wallet breaks.

Well, collapse is a relative term. There will always be an equilibrium. If the fees are $50 per transaction, only the high value transactions will go through, but we will still be hitting the ceiling in number of transactions every day. However, other cryptos will step in to take the use case of smaller value transactions, and they may grow bigger than Bitcoin in terms of number of transactions per day, as Ethereum already has. This means the potential for Bitcoin's growth is hindered, and the price may fall in comparison to alts based on perception alone.
We must realize that if people are willing to pay $50 for the transaction it means Bitcoin reached a completely different use case from Today, and it's extremely useful and thus warrants a high price, but who knows if the market will understand this.

For such numbers we need to be able to serve 100x more transactions per second. For that to happen we need many optimizations like Schnorr signatures. Eventually a block size increase too, when 10TB SSDs and 1GB internet connections are commonplace. I think in 4-5 years.

So according to the interviewee, younger people prefer Bitcoin by far to Gold.
Based on personal experience, this is **absolutely** true. I know kids as young as 8 who are already invested into Bitcoin. Kids buy Bitcoin from their parents, and from each other at small $50 amounts. Some earn it online for small tasks, like creating character drawings (called OCs), and selling gamer user accounts at high levels. I have met one child who had a 0.1 ounce gold coin as well in their portfolio. They can't own stocks, land, or bonds, but they can own cash, gold and bitcoin. They keep their Satoshis on their tablets and smart phones. They know about backups, risks and fees. It's quite fascinating and inspiring really, but I don't find it surprising. At 10 I was collecting, trading and selling cards for cash as well.
If this trend continues, and I see no reason why it wouldn't, the demand for Bitcoin will grow as more young people with money enter the markets.

Depends what metric you're looking at. It's not just about market cap. Market cap can easily be manipulated. I can easily pre-mine a coin with a trillion tokens and sell you 100 for $100. Suddenly my coin's marketcap on paper is a trillion dollars. In reality it's zero.
Currently BTC is NOT No.1 in number of transactions or maximum on-chain transaction capacity. But, it is No.1 in every other metric such as trading volume, value transferred, active addresses, merchant acceptance, brand recognition, etc.
Bitcoin needs to scale with adoption to stay No.1, and that's not trivial if you want to keep it decentralized as that's where the long term value is rooted in. There are multiple ways to scale, and Bitcoin is exploring multiple options, which is a good strategy: optimizing transaction size, lightning network, sidechains, and eventually a dynamic blocksize to support the second layer solutions working well.
Ethereum is trying sharding, which will likely work, but it's still a really very resource intensive network. Other coins raised the blocksize, which is a very short term unsustainable solution, and the markets seem not to put faith in that solution either. There is also mimblewimble which is an entirely novel and highly scalable way of doing blockchains. It will likely become a new coin once the code and testing is done, but it's going to take 5-10 years to see if it can gain any significant market-share. And, there is also DAG used by coins like Byteball, which is not even a blockchain anymore, but it's not yet proven on any major coin to be safe. Also, we don't know how it will scale.
The cool thing about Bitcoin is that any development or ideas on chains that have been forked from Bitcoin (like LTC) can relatively easily be ported back to Bitcoin. Also any large scale tests ran by other coins can inform Bitcoin developers. So all the alt coin experiments feed back into Bitcoin becoming better eventually.
Also, if you're a developer wanting to get into crypto, you really only have two good options: Bitcoin and Ethereum, however Ethereum is not an option for those with high integrity, because it has proven to be a centrally managed and manipulated coin, that is not immutable since the DAO fork, when they literally hard-forked the chain to take coins away from one party and give it to another group of folks. The fork was done with good intentions to take the coins away from a "thief", but it's against the whole premise of immutability and that thief was just doing what the contract allowed him to do. He wasn't doing anything illegal, or even immoral in a sense that he didn't break any written or unwritten rules. He literally played by the rules of the contract everyone agreed to. The original Ethereum chain now called Ethereum Classic didn't collapse, which proves that the hard fork was unnecessary and it was just an "inside job" to save a close circle of investors who made a poor investment decision by not checking the contract thoroughly before putting their money into the DAO. Thus, Bitcoin ends up with the brightest minds with the highest integrity. This is great on the long term.
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:55:01
Bitcoin (not just blockchain) can free us because it's free of any centralized entity's control. Therefore they can't manipulate this form of money to their advantage against your wishes.
I'm unsure how Bitcoin could enslave anybody. You're free to use it or not. Nobody forces you.
Can it be centralized and controlled? Not really no. If Bitcoin ever approaches dangerous levels of centralization in any way, the users of Bitcoin will simply fork away or reject the new rules. Thus, while Bitcoin may suffer damage in many ways, I don't think it will ever be centralized or controlled, unless the whole community of Bitcoiners decides that they want that to happen. I can't imagine a scenario where that would happen though.
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:22:31
You're correct that BTC won't be the currency forever. Who knows what will happen in 200-300 years. Maybe we won't need currency at all, or the concept of currency will change fundamentally. Maybe Bitcoin still be king of all currencies. If you had to choose between any of the alts or Bitcoin, Bitcoin still has more chance of being the one than any of the random alts. For an investor it's not a question whether BTC or alts. It's BTC or a very specific alt. And there is a lot of competition between alts. Is it ETH, XRP, Stellar, Doge, BCH (lol)? The problem is that even if an alt does win, you don't know which one. You chances of getting the right alt selected is like 1:100 or even less because so much will happen in the next 10 years. But if you have to bet between BTC or alt, BTC has at least 50% chance of winning. So overall, betting on Bitcoin is still safer. And, because most investors are rational and bet on Bitcoin. this makes Bitcoin actually win. A self fulfilling bet even if just 50% of investors bet on Bitcoin, because the other 50% will be spread among hundreds of alts.
Bitcoin isn't the greatest in any specific feature. ETH has more versatile contracts, but is it the safest contracts, or is it the cheapest fees, is it the most well known? No. Doge may have cheap fees, but does it have the brand, does it have the security, etc? No. XRP may be fast, but is it decentralised in terms of control and ownership? No. Only Bitcoin has all the features at a pretty high level. It obviously has the security, the decentralisation, the brand, and acceptance down. But it also has sophisticated contracts: you can issue tokens on it, we have LN which is the largest smart contract use to date surpassing even CryptoKitties in terms of development resources, use, and utility. It has the speed with LN and Liquid. It has a huge developer base with very dedicated and most highly qualified devs. You can clearly see that while bitcoin may be threatened in isolated areas, it's standing strong overall. And the interesting thing in open source development is that any innovation or experiment on an alt, is directly beneficial to Bitcoin, because it feeds the know-how and the pool of resources Bitcoin can draw from. Even a failed alt provides great value to Bitcoin, because we know what not to do.
Is store of value debatable? Yes, it's only 10 years old, not 2,000 like gold. But with every year Bitcoin stays afloat, not even appreciating the store of value proposition is growing exponentially. Store of value doesn't just mean it's protecting you from inflation, it means it protects you from confiscation or arbitrary blocking of your funds by a government, bank or some other authority. Bitcoin is winning that game so far, by staying decentralised.
Yes, things socio-economically may change in a way that influences Bitcoin in a major way negatively. But they can also change in a way that makes Bitcoin go stratospheric. If a major country went into recession and hyperinflation it could boost Bitcoin beyond any mooner's expectation. Imagine if people in Japan started to lose faith in their fiat? Many of them would start buying dollar and Euro, but many would also start buying BTC. The USD and EURO may rise 5% in value in result, but Bitcoin will go 10x.

Even if BTC fails for any reason, there is little chance BCH would take its place, which is what BCH fans are rooting for.
Let's hypothetically imagine that something happens to Bitcoin which makes it collapse completely. Fore example there is a major unrepairable bug in the mining algo, or the Bitcoin brand suffers some irreparable damage in some way, etc. In this scenario Ethereum and Litecoin have a much bigger chance to succeed taking over Bitcoin's place because they already have a much bigger usage than BCH, and they don't share the Bitcoin name.
Therefore, even if you want to keep alts as a hedge, I would probably diversify into ETH and Litecoin, not BCH. Perhaps sell your BCH, and buy 2 parts BTC, 1 part ETH, and 1 part LTC. Also, there are many other forks. You may have those too, you could sell those for BTC as well.
I wouldn't consider XRP, because it's not a true crypto. Nor would I consider any other smaller cryptos, as they are likely going to lose value on the long term, and become irrelevant like Peercoin, and literally thousands of others coins, most of which are not even listed anywhere anymore. There is too much competition in the space of third and fourth tier of cryptos, it's impossible to tell which one will survive.

They can compete alright, and I hope they will continue to do so, because we need the ideas and the vibrancy they bring into the space. The question is can any of the alts win the maximalism game?
I think it's extremely unlikely given Bitcoin's brand name, security, acceptability and ecosystem, speed of development, existing feature set, and decentralisation levels. An alt can win in any one of the mentioned features individually, maybe even in two, but it's nearly impossible to win in all of them at once at this point, which would be required to take over Bitcoin.
Having said that, it's not impossible. Bitcoin has many challenges to overcome, there is so much work to be done, just like on all alts. It has to find a reliable proven scaling technology, which we may already have with LN or Liquid, but we don't know for sure yet. It needs to have much better UX for second layer wallets on all platforms. It needs to gain the long term trust of billions around the world.

Well, you can love a stock too, if your values align with a company. Lots of people love Google or Apple for example.
Yeah, nobody knows if Bitcoin is Myspace or Facebook. Both currencies and social networks are driven by network effects. But Bitcoin is very different from Myspace in an important aspect. Very few people had serious monetary or emotional attachment to Myspace. Whatever is new in social media, people will try it. Whatever is new in crypto, people are sceptical, because it may be attacked because the code isn't hardened, there is not enough hash power protecting it (whatever other mechanism is place), and it's hard to invite your friends to try it, because there is a financial barrier to entry. So older systems have even stronger stronger protections, beyond the network effect, against newcomers than social networks.

To compromise will be forced on the community. We keep the status quo until one the two things happen:
The fees get so outrageous high that, no matter how highly decentralised Bitcoin is, it becomes useless for both first and second layer. Thus prices will start to fall, and mining power moves away. If this were to happen, the risk of losing the project to high fees and low security is greater than the risk of losing some percentage of nodes due to a larger block size, so the community will together agree to increase the block size, because it's the lesser of two evils. It may result in a fork, with the small block Bitcoin getting minority hash power and community support.
Another possibility is that hardware and internet connection worldwide improves rapidly in the coming 2-3 years, and we can easily handle a larger blocksize even on our phones. In a world where gigabit internet connection and i9 processors are commonplace, even Luke Dashjr will be OK with a modest 10-20% increase per year. There will be pressure to increase layer 1 capacity to stay competitive with other coins. The community will start supporting such a solution because it helps the global growth and usage, and increases security through because more people can use bitcoin, thus more people will decide to run their own nodes too.
In my view, instead of increasing the block size, it would be a better to decrease the 10 minute blocksize to 5 minute and cut the mining reward in half. It would provide a better user experience, and help blocks propagate better, which is probably worth it even if it increases the orphan rate. But I'm no expert. Let the experts discuss and decide.
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:19:35

It's not safe. With zero conf, theoretically you could deposit a huge number of BCH, and simultaneously sell it on Bitstamp for another coin, and also attempt a double spend the same coins to another account you own. If the double spend is successful, you keep your BCH and also get the coins you traded the fake coins for. This can be done in an automated fashion within seconds with multiple accounts.

The real answer is they wait to make sure there are no chargebacks. Criminals steal credit cards or access people’s bank accounts and try to buy bitcoins with it. Two weeks is typically enough for the victim to report the crime and for the bank to initiate a chargeback. This way, Coinbase can avoid losing bitcoins without getting the dollars in return.

But there is still Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram and Pinterest. Everyone else is dying in social. No matter how good their features are. Even Google plus died, and they had everything: talent, money, potential users, reach, brand, etc. Network effect is stronger than all of those combined. 
Same with crypto. We will have Bitcoin taking the majority of the market, and maybe another 4 that serve niches. However it’s hard to tell what those 4 will be. It is almost certain it won’t be the same ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH combination. New, advanced coins will compete hard for the second tier.
The rest will die or stay practically irrelevant.
With crypto the network effect is even stronger than with social because security is strongly tied to price. Also there is a strong monetary inventive to sell and abandon alts, there is little incentive to actively abandon your alternative social accounts. 
The only thing going for alts is that you can gamble with them. They are like numbers on a roulette table.

That's hard to tell, but there is a level which is reasonable, which keeps users in the Bitcoin camp. Also the number of crypto users grows overall, so new users have to decide which coin do they use primarily. And if there is no capacity on Bitcoin, they will use an another coin, which can with time outgrow Bitcoin.
1. **Bitcoin 9M** users: $1 fee vs Other coin 1M users: $0.1 fee
2. **Bitcoin 10M** users: $10 fee vs Other coin 5M users: $0.2 fee
3. **Bitcoin 10M** users: $50 fee vs Other coin 10M users: $0.3 fee
4. Bitcoin 10M users: $50 fee vs **Other coin 15M** users: $0.4 fee
5. Bitcoin 9M users: $1 fee vs **Other coin 25M** users: $0.6 fee
6. Bitcoin 7M users: $0.1 fee vs **Other coin 40M** users: $0.8 fee
7. Bitcoin 2M users: $0.01 fee vs **Other coin 60M** users: $1 fee
We're currently at around stage 2-3. Once we enter stage 3-4, we still have the opportunity to turn it around, by increasing the block size slightly to keep the prices low and proving more capacity for layer 1 and layer 2 solutions to accept new users. If we don't, at stage 5 an irreversible thing starts to happen, and even if we were to increase the block size it won't matter because the other coin have become more important with more users and stronger network effects.
But I understand it's a very fine balance because if we overshoot it, we end up losing nodes, and that would also risk Bitcoin from another perspective.
We need to find a very fine balance. I'm confident that the community will be able to find that balance.
As mentioned above, there is also a high chance that sidechains, and second layers really work out and let layer 1 just serve a high-security and allow many people to onboard.

When you buy bitcoin from an exchange they could open a channel with you and send the funds on LN in one transaction. Thus, you as a bitcoin user will have your bitcoins and it’s already in a channel with an exchange which is likely very well connected to the rest of the LN network. You will be able to instantly pay virtually any LN invoice.
Why would the exchange do this? Because it’s a service that makes them competitive and because it allows you to send back the funds to sell the bitcoins instantly on the LN channel, so the exchange can make more trading fees off you. It also increases the exchanges’s connectedness and thus they can make money on LN routing fees.
Once your received your first LN bitcoins, you can’t yet receive additional LN payments without an on-chain transaction, but you can of course receive on-chain payments. Once you spent some of your bitcoins in your new channel you can keep the channel open and receive LN payments too.

As all analogies the fuel analogy is false. You get less range with a double fuel tank because you have to carry your fuel with you. But anyway, I get the idea. I think it's not fitting because in case of the base blocksize increase we're enabling second layer solutions, which is what we really want. If you can't efficiently open and close LN channels, because the transaction on chain costs more than the channel's value, there is no point to LN. The base blockchain needs to grow to enable LN and other second layers, not because we want to transact on base layer.
Btw, Segwit in itself is the opposite of what you said. If you compare these two: 1MB Base + 4MB Segwit or 5MB Base. The second option will give you more transactions. Look at the blocks now, they are over 2MB in total, but only enable transactions equivalent to what a simple 1.2MB block would allow. We're right now actually wasting disk space, bandwidth and money.
Segwit enabling LN, is a different story. It's all worth it of course, but let facts be stated.

On the last point, Luke is not representing consensus in Bitcoin development and he's not consistent on that point either. Here is the part related to block size which is the official roadmap on [Bitcoin.org](
**"Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the basic software engineering from being the limiting factor."**

Good point!
$60 will be less value by 2024-2028 due to inflation appr. $45 in Today's prices. Also, we will likely have more than 10K transactions in 4MB. With the optimizations like Schnorr, native segwit addresses, and increased segwit adoption altogether we will probably have an average of 20K transactions in a block. Thus, we're looking at an actual transaction cost of $22 or less in Today's prices. Still too much, but we will be touching the first layer much less often. Most people will probably transact on side-chains and on LN.  
We need to consider allowing wallets to set fees in sub satoshi ranges per byte, to compensate for the increased value of a satoshi, thus the overall mining fee rewards will grow slower, but the network remains more affordable. I think some wallets already allow that. Theoretically, we can send a transaction for 1 sat total fee if there are no considerable transaction competition for block size.

There is a good plan to do robust on-chain scaling. We have MAST and Schnorr coming which will make the first layer more confidential, and allow for smaller transactions with multiple inputs. After that the Core roadmap includes blocksize increase as well, but in a way that is dynamic so we don't have to fork for this purpose every few years. This is to ensure that base layer capacity issues don't impede the growth of the network as a whole including second layers.

What's idiotic is to think that we can and should store every single coffee purchase on everyone's full node.
The Core's idea of what Bitcoin should be is right. Bitcoin should be a first layer solution that secures a bunch of second layers that can serve different purposes. LN and Bakkt can serve the coffer purchases, Liquid can serve exchanges, RSK can serve smart contracts, etc. This way we have the best of both worlds, we can retain a decentralized and thus valuable international and independent currency, and we have a bunch of fast and cheap second layer solutions that are tailored to a specific use case that do not burden the first layer as much as storing every single coffee purchase would have.
The quotes are true. Fiat IS easier to use right now, but soon LN and Bakkt will be equally as easy.
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:54:47
When you send a bitcoin transaction you need to add a fee that is claimed by miners. This fee is measured in satoshis/ byte. Typical transactions are appr. 300 bytes, so if your fee rate is 1 satoshi, your transaction fee will be 300 satoshis.  But transaction size depends on many things like how many inputs and outputs you have. And 1 satoshi is very low. Nowadays you need to pay 10-100 satoshis depending on how busy the network. 
If you want to optimize the fee against network business and how fast you want your transaction to confirm you would set the fee rate manually.

But it is used a commodity ledger, only on the second layer. It's still the same underlying token, just used in a more efficient manner.
LN and Bakkt is like gold backed paper currency in many ways. The paper still represents the gold in the vault, you just don't need to carry around gold coins, and chop them up to small pieces to pay for coffee. On the downside it's not physical gold, so you rely on the currency issuer to redeem your gold. So it's only good for small purchases, not your savings.
Same way, LN or Bakkt bitcoins are still bitcoins, they are just more easier, faster and cheaper to move, but the payments are not settled on chain, so you rely on the infrastructure of LN or Bakkt to be able to settle. 
You trade a bit of security for convenience, which is reasonable for small amounts.

I don’t think it’s about percentages. It’s the absolute number of nodes that matters. The more users with full nodes the harder it is to force a hostile protocol change.
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:53:41
Basically the idea here is that both the sender and receiver broadcasts their transactions request (pheromones) and then wait for 3 seconds to see if there is a match found on the network. Since 1 seconds is enough to propagate the pheromones to the great majority of the LN network according to the video, within 3 seconds the sender can receive all the found routes and can decide based on settings which one to chose. Finally, sender can send the funds to the receiver through the selected route. According to the video this system can scale to 10,000+ tx/s, which is comparable to VISA.
Questions / Observations:
* The routes (matches) do not contain the capacity of the channels between points. Did I miss something? Is channel capacity considered while propagating the pheromone in the first place and drop it if the capacity is too low?
* Does this 10K tx mean routing is solved for the foreseeable future? What are some potential gotchas?
* The bigger the number of nodes and channels, the better the system will work, because there will be more chances a suitable low fee route can be found. But it also takes longer to propagate the pheromones, so it's possible if the network becomes very large with millions of nodes, it may take 2-3 seconds to propagate, which is still acceptable. However, the sender can be configured to balance speed and cost, and for example you could set your LN transaction in your wallet to be fast and expensive, thus use the first route that is found and don't wait for competing potentially cheaper routers, or if the transaction is not urgent you could set it to wait 5 or even more seconds until all possible routes come in and then choose the cheapest possible route.
* The bigger the number of transactions the more memory and processing power LN nodes will need, but they are compensated for the work with fees. And you as a node operator can limit the amount of processing power and memory you're willing to dedicate to the network, and still be a useful and profitable node to an extent. Still, there is going to be an incentive to run on a machine as powerful as possible, in order to be the first to process and propagate pheromones and potentially be part of the route and thus collect fees. Slower nodes may be cheaper, but the sender may not wait long enough to receive a good route from them. There is also an incentive to create many well funded low fee channels of course. So, basically the incentives create a free market with a race to the bottom to provide the cheapest routing fees possible. Potentially you could create a node that connects to all nodes willing to open a channel to you and thus become a super node that everyone can go through at any time and you could potentially collect the majority of the fees. However, if you ever raise your fees too high, nodes can just route around you.
* A positive side effect of ant routing is that it can help you split up your payments to multiple parts to send a large payment, since you have multiple routes available.
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:40:41
Overall good video, because it shows how casanode looks like and how it works. The author also has generally the right ideas. But there are certain inaccuracies in the video.
* You won't be making money with an LN node at this scale. The most one can hope for is to make enough in routing fees to cover your own fees, so you essentially use the network for free in return for routing payments. However, this guy can start small to learn and eventually set-up larger nodes to actually make money. So it's a good start.
* The "lightning address" is called an invoice.
* It's not surprising you need to sync the bitcoin blockchain before you can use LN. LN is a second layer on top of Bitcoin's network. To operate LN you must have access to an up-to-date Bitcoin blockchain.
* Autopilot doesn't open channels to "hubs", it could be any LN nodes. Could be another casanode.
* The explanation of how LN is related to onion routing was confusing, but fundamentally he's right that you can't see where a routed payment is coming from and where it's going. You can only see one step away from your node.
* I'm not sure you lose the whole Bitcoin blockchain if you lose power on casanode. That can't be right. The blockchain is on your persistent disk, not in memory only.
I wish there was some explanation about how to back casanode up, because you really don't want to lose your funds if the device gets stolen or goes bust.

I guess one would have to carefully prepare such an attack, and I didn’t think about it but maybe governments together deciding to block full nodes from the network to stop the propagation of transactions, validation and mining. In this scenario the more absolute full nodes or running on the most diverse set of connections the better.

That's cool. Spending those Bitcoins is a good thing and decreases investor risk for Bitcoin because the BTC ownership gets more decentralized / spread out.
On the other hand those few individuals who are buying and mining those forked coins are killing their own goose by centralizing the ownership of their forked coins, and thus increasing investor risk. Apparently more than 1.5M of those forked coins is in the hands of 2 organizations / individuals. That's nuts. This is probably why the value of those forked coins is dropping against Bitcoin, despite their efforts.
Investors are not idiots. They see through such manipulation and they don't want to end up holding the bag.

They introduced a payment protocol that has very limited wallet support and thus makes it hard for users to pay if they use the majority of wallets. This is done partially to drive users towards their wallets which don’t support segwit.
They don’t want to use segwit on purpose to artificially increase the amount of space a transaction takes on the blockchain and to increase mining fees compared to payments using widely used and fully backwards compatible segwit addresses.
They are doing this to intentionally hold back bitcoin to create a fake competitive advantage for their altcoin.
This is unethical business and bitcoiners aren’t stupid to recognize them for what they are.
Such short term business strategy to push an altcoin will on the long term fire back and they will lose business to competing companies, and will make them irrelevant in the bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:46:41
Incresed segwit adoption gave Bitcoin a 10-15% capacity boost. But fees will rise again when the demand for transactions will go beyond capacity limits again. Hopefully segwit adoption will grow again with even more capacity boost. We can easily grow to 70-80% from 40% we are at now.
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:51:27
I hope he knows correlation is not causation. Blocks are full, so a possible explanation why nodes are not increasing is because Bitcoin can’t handle more users. If we could process 10x more transactions we would have more users and thus more nodes ran by those many more users. Yes, some nodes would drop but the new ones would more than compensate for it. I’m not sure about this, just pointing out that there are multiple explanations and projections possible using when looking at the facts.

No. It’s not the exchange’s LN. There is no such concept.
You keep bitcoins on an LN channel between you and the exchange. You don’t need the permission of the exchange to use those LN bitcoins. As you spend and receive bitcoins the bitcoins propagate through the LN network. Technically nothing propagates anywhere of course. It’s all just signatures giving you access to move coins over LN and on-chain. 
With a bank you rely on the bank to give you your dollars.
LN is trustless. Bank fully relies on trust.

Because the base layer provides the security, so no matter what the security model, occasionally you must touch the base chain. You can't just have an LN wallet without seed words on the main chain right, or we're back to custodial wallets, which is something we do not want.
So even if let's say one person only touches the base layer once a month, we're talking about being able to serve 15M people only. With various cool tech we can increase that to maybe 50M. That's still less than 1% of the world. So we will eventually need to increase the block size to increase capacity on chain by one or two magnitudes just to serve people on a super efficient base chain on second layer systems.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:23:31
I understand your reasons why you say so, and I don't want to dispute them, because I'm in full agreement. Decentralization is the most important property of bitcoin, without which it makes no sense to run a blockchain.
But, do you really think that with a larger block size and more adoption we will lose nodes faster from old node operators than we gain from new ones? For example with simplified numbers:
At 1MB block size, 1 million users run 1 thousand nodes. Do you think that at 2MB block size, and 2 million users will run less than 1 thousand nodes?
To me that seem unrealistic. Nodes will likely not double, but we will surely gain nodes overall. I assume the number will be anywhere between 1,000 thousands and 2,000 thousand nodes. We must remember, that while it is true that a bigger block size means more expensive to run a node, it is also true that the Bitcoin network becomes more valuable when the user base doubles, so there is counter acting incentive for running a node. For example, if I only use Bitcoin occasionally, I may not run my own node. But if I start receiving my salary in Bitcoin due to higher adoption, I will run my own node for sure, because the stakes are higher, and I transact regularly.

You're correct, there is no limit on transactions, but the size of the base block without the segwit part. There are so many different variables though. In the most optimal case where everyone is using bech32 native segwit addresses, we can get to 1.9x, but that's not going to happen. We will always have people who use legacy addresses and inefficient transactions, which wastes space. I think the best we can hope for is something like 1.5-1.6x. Realistically I think we will get to 1.4x in a few years, and then stall, which is where I get the +40% from. Currently we're only at like +20-25%.

Actually it's not unreasonable to think that there is a correlation between large difficulty drops and and price increases.  Several reasons:
* When difficulty drops it means blocks are mined slower, meaning there is less bitcoin to be sold by miners
* When difficulty drops it typically happens because the price dropped significantly beforehand, so miners had to quit mining at the current difficulty level (this indeed happened)
* When price drops, many traders are sitting on the sidelines in dollars waiting out the next bullrun to start, so there is a lot of pressure building up from the buying side, any positive event will trigger a buying frenzy
However, not all difficulty drops are good signs, consistent drop over long periods of time are a price negative signal.

Question: What is the difference in transaction size between:
**A: Sum of 2 transactions with each having 1 input, and 2 outputs.**
**B: One transaction with 2 inputs and 4 outputs?**
Is B significantly smaller than A?
If yes, can't we have a service called "transaction pool" where people submit transactions and then a decentralised service batches hundreds of transactions into one transaction and submit them to the mempool as one giant transaction? This could reduce fees and increase the number of inputs and outputs that can fit into a block. Especially effective once we have Schnorr signatures, not?

Two issues with it:
1. It doesn’t support RBF and based on their support they don’t want to implement it either. They sort of said, the Bitcoin Core devs should solve the scaling issue, so there would not be a need for RBF.
2. It doesn’t let you set a custom fee. You have to take the wallet recommendation and there are only two levels of urgency. It’s not clear how many sats each sets at any given time.
Aside from these, it’s cool.

Yes, I think if you provide larger capacity channels, you will be one of the few nodes that can route larger payments, thus you can attract more routing jobs. Also, the more channels you open the bigger chance you can route a payment between two parties. Ideally you would want to open a channel to all major players in the industry and allow anyone to open a channel to you who wants to have good connectivity. I think this is what LNBIG.com does. Tons of large nodes with many channels open.
