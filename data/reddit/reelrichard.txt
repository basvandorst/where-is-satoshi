personally, i think there will still be a wealthy elite class.  however, over time, if this elite/ultra-wealthy class is not productive under a bitcoin world, where seigniorage and the cantillon effect is largely mitigated, they will lose their power and status over time.

heads up though, they increased their fees to coinbase levels a couple months back and i switched back to coinbase pro/gdax.
but their fees used to be low and i liked instant deposits (you just couldn't withdraw from exchange until payment cleared bank)

NBA player victor oladipo texted his trainer after his season ended a couple of days ago. Dirk was inspired and texted his trainer the same thing, this was his trainers response. Dirk is considered old in the NBA-hence the calendar joke.

To me, it’s an indication of the bottom/near bottom. And once the news starts going bad but price still increases, i look at it as the opposite

it doesn't really matter
it's an open source protocol and mastercard can utilize bitcoin however they want, just dont adopt their service if you dont agree with it
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:05:55
try btc or btc-usd
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:55:05
short term, bearish
long term, noise

yuan has devalued to new lows.  wealthy chinese are fleeing the yuan.

the power of low-time preference.

then educate yourself on the economic properties of bitcoin.  if BTC gets you this anxious, i recommend selling or holding an amount you are comfortable with regardless of the price

i would argue otherwise, they can stop a central point of failure (FB and its partners/master nodes)
they can't stop people from around the world volunteering bandwidth and computing power to secure the network

his price predictions does make him less credible but his twitter feed i do find useful. fundstrat (i believe he runs or owns it), does publish decent research that has a different perspective than the majority of the market

really loved this series of medium articles and comparing BTC to mycelium(the fungi network)
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:01:45
dont look in the short term.  i first bought btc at 6k, 9k, 17k, 14k, 12k, 8k, 5k, 3k... and so on... im gonna dollar cost average just like I do my ROTH IRA.  
none of us know the highs or lows, i'm not a skilled trader and my working/earning years are still early and I have a long way to go.  So i save in USD, equities, and BTC

I live in a house with 4 other roomates and we usually near our 1gb limit.
This may be ignorant of me but I assume a full node takes up a decent amount of bandwidth and that’s the reason I don’t run it

any company can do anything they want with bitcoin, bitcoin don't care.  
open-source and permission-less.
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:45:57
try the Abra app, the fees are high though with credit card
@_date: 2019-04-30 01:23:35
beauty of open-source and permission-less
if you dont trust an exchange, dont use it.  but they can create whatever products they want from bitcoin, doesn't bother us one bit
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:23:27
do you have a blog or twitter we can follow?  
anyways, good work

does the fund manager actually buy physical coins or does it just track the prices of the assets like the greyscale etf?
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:10:39
It will, but once all this money comes in and people see gains, they get greedy.  Then they look for something that can bring a greater yield and in the cryptospace, that is altcoins
