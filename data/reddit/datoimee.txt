Coinbase you brought this on yourself.  You chose to side with Roger Ver and Btrash!  You Chose "POORLY"!
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:01:00
What a joke, 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:57:43
Oh I like that!  Who are you pumping for?  
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:46:47
OK for you that really understand lightning channels, let's think big.  How will a company like Amazon use channels to service all of their btc customers in the future.  Thanks in advance for the lesson on lightning
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:59:29
What's the big deal?  Your contracts are to be settled on completion at the current bitcoin price, so no problem
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:17:21
I know, I was always a supporter of Coinbase.  I can be pretty stupid sometimes.  Oh, how that saying goes = I make mistakes everyday!
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:42:50
You and your F**king btrash!!
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:21:54
Wow, sold it all!  I am just glad to be an ongoing part of an idea that is driving the world of technology forward in so many ways.  Those that try to do us harm = are just giving the revolution a guide and direction to move forward at a pace never before seen!  Good luck to you.  I won't hodl all my bitcoin forever, but I will never sell it all!
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:08:51
No don't worry about that.  The community learned to never again allow the miners to be the deciders on an upgrade.  Remember the old saying = Fuck us once - shame on you!  Fuck us twice - shame on us!!
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:30:36
Makes me just want to jump up and do a high 5!  Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:35:00
No big deal for a hodler.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:49:29
Yeah, it is so easy when your only goal is to get rich quick.  Buying bitcoin is not a single choice you make, but instead thousands of choices you make to hodl or sell - every day!
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:08:28
No!  They are in too tight with the US govt.  Now maybe if Apple did it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:33:43
Thank you from your neighbor to the South - Philippines.  So proud of you all and can't wait to visit one day!!!
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:57:52
You are so right - there is enough bad in the world.  With bitcoin I only see the positive!!  So I'm a hodler through thick and thin.  HooRay
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:18:51
It is not meant to solve everything.  It is just another tech step in the evolution of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a major driving force in the tech world and we will see improvements in the coming years that we can't even imagine today.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:56:08
Oh my, are we a little angry?  Just HODL!!  Oh "Negative Wan" lol
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:54:15
I don't mine but I do read a lot of posts.  If I mined there is only 1 pool I would consider joining = Slush Pool!  They are the only one I feel that puts the community first and if you check the payouts - they are very good in comparison.  Antpool = don't get me started.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:12:22
boy it's so nice to have someone as positive as you here, lol
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:19:33
Ver/Wu/Conbase and the cronies who follow and support their efforts to derail bitcoin deserve any and all hardships coming their way.  To put it in proper perspective = I wouldn't PISS on them even if they were on FIRE!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:35:47
lmao, when you buy so low it just doesn't matter so enjoy the ride.  Weeeeeee
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:07:44
Back atcha Bitch!!
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:02:30
I live outside the US, but hope this is a killer app for you all to use.  Anything to drive folks away from coinbase is good!!
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:34:18
Thanks for sharing, wish everyone would watch
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:58:42
This is good.  Companies of all sizes can begin to use bitcoin with Lightning.  Bright future ahead for all hodlers
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:55:48
Sorry dude, would have loved to seen a pic of your new Lambo
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:04:17
you forgot btrash
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:49:07
bcash bcash bcash lol Roger
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:30:59
Thanks for the laugh!
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:17:56
Good news is good news! Doesn't matter when, where or how much.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:44:13
I must say, I was feeling mean and wanted to piss somebody off.  I am in at an average of $500.  Just want people to keep the faith.  Hodl and ye shall prevail or some crap like that.  Believe me when I say I only want the best for bitcoin and everything that has to do with bitcoin.  So word to all = just hodl and enjoy the ride!!!  Great luck to you and all
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:15:42
That would do it.  I think you are on the right track and I can't say enough how smart I think you are to be using bitcoin in your method of pay = very smart!!
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:30:29
Changelly worked great for me a few weeks ago to dump bcash and bgold and convert to btc
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:36:49
Who gives a shit about their laws unless you run into the police station and confess to being a crypto criminal 
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:21:44
Really thats good.  I am glad you have a choice = good luck to you all!!
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:26:04
This is cool, you have Canada going crypto to the north and Mexico going crypto to the south.  This leaves a desperate country in the middle who can't even afford to keep the lights on. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:00:14
I sold to buy a new home.  But was able to keep a lot left, so I am playing with the houses money and will keep till it hits 60K to slowing begin selling.  I am old and retired so it is so much fun to just be involved.  What is your sell point.
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:12:29
I used them to dump all of my bcash and bgold and was very happy with the results.  But they can be slow
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:21:20
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:42:29
Miners are rewarded btc for mining.  Fee's are a bonus if available.  In the beginning of btc = fee's equal near "0" so we are now coming full circle to where it all began and should be!  The days of miners spamming the network to create artificially high fees is about to come to an end.
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:52:37
Nope, just wanted to put this out there.
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:36:44
I was so glad to be able to convert my bth and btg to BTC.  The coming year will be very interesting as things develop.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:46:29
Thanks for posting, great read!
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:58:05
When I look around on this website at ads and information on related articles = I lose all trust in this site, looks like something Roger shilled for!
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:36:28
That was the only good thing I could say about them.  Good for you as well
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:22:06
Tether, Shmether= couldn't care less!!
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:35:09
It's going to be very interesting to see how the US keeps up and attracts this new tech.  Many countries are taking the lead.  This tech thou is different in that it hurts the rich and powerful = they don't like that.  Good luck to you and all of us
@_date: 2019-07-31 00:17:21
Yeah, but be careful till we know if they are legit
@_date: 2019-07-30 05:28:20
Hey, got a new one for you to check out.  It is still in the works for bitcoin but looks promising.  Let me know what you think   
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:49:38
I may be wrong but doesn't only the winner get the fees associated with mining the rewarded blocks?  That's what I think, but hey let me know
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:39:17
Dam, you need a hobby if you worry about this shit
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:24:12
You are still an early adopter.  So when do we know that bitcoin is truly hit mainstream?  When every shop you walk into has a sticker on the door =  " We accept Visa, Master Card, Discover Card and Bitcoin".  Just one hodlers vision
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:17:27
I must agree!  Living in the Philippines is great for bitcoin.  The US will come around - it has not choice and I love it.  Let the President, Congress and the Banksters try their best only to realize in the end = Wow I think were F**ked!!
@_date: 2019-07-31 07:48:55
thats true
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:17:02
can you use these on SlushPool?  
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:18:58
Wow, that really looks cool
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:19:19
Hey Donald, first I am one of your staunchest supporters.  But this tweet and opinion ties with your views on climate change.  If you truly want to make America Great Again = Be a leader in this new tech evolution or follow the world as a wanna be.
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:54:39
Yep I agree.  Not for me but just putting it out there on our reddit
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:05:36
now thats funny, thanks for the laugh
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:34:34
used them a couple of weeks ago to dump bcash and bgold for btc and it worked great
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:33:31
Nah,  if he can't figure it out for himself = F**k him
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:50:49
I love it, the world is moving on and time is not on their side
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:23:19
This is the news I have been wanting to hear for a long time.  Anything bad for Bitmain is good for Bitcoin!  We need worldwide mining and more hardware options.
@_date: 2019-07-30 04:13:45
Yeah, nothing is ever good for bitcoin if Ver or Bitmain are involved
@_date: 2019-07-30 02:14:29
You made me look it up so read it!!  I don't deal with companies who have their noses up bitmain or ver's A**!         
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:29:52
Wow, thank you so much for posting this link.  I was not really a circle fan but I am now.  This was the best best speech I have heard ever given to Congress on what is really going on in the world of crypto.  One like myself wonders - will the US (dominated by the rich and the banksters) hold back innovation and allow its place in the world of technical superiority fall behind the rest of the world as it buries its head in the sand?
@_date: 2019-07-28 07:10:50
I agree with you totally.  Here in the Philippines we are doing just fine on bitcoin and not being treated like enemies of the state as those in the US are
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:11:25
I don't think you will wake up in a few years and say to yourself = Dam I never should have gotten rid of my Shitcoins!
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:14:33
Wow, thanks for posting!  This needs to be a commercial on the next Super Bowl
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:41:42
Dam, that really sums it up, Wow thanks for the post
@_date: 2019-07-28 07:07:58
Hello and no problem, I have been told by those at Lolli that even though they let me sign up and all = Only US citizens are allowed to get btc.  My country will be added in the future.  I can't believe you have not received anything yet.  So I do not promote Lolli in anyway as of now.  On twitter I refer to Lolli as a myth!  Now BlockFi on the other hand has been paying out as promised and no problems.  Thanks again and let me know if you ever get paid
@_date: 2019-07-04 04:01:29
Good for them.  Using USD as a weapon should be countered by any means!  Maybe John McAfee can help them
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:55:41
I agree with you in that anything and everything about bitcoin must really prove itself or you and your coins are soon parted.  Good luck to us all
@_date: 2019-07-10 04:26:27
Just had an idea for a novelty/investment item = 1 oz gold bullion coin like above with the price of BTC at the time of minting.  You know like .1 BTC value = 1 oz of gold.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:49
wow, it's good you didn't buy knowing what you do.  Good luck in your future investments.  I'm just going to see if my future predictions come true.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:33:37
They can only know of the btc you bought on a regulated NYC type of account.  So if you bought the btc from an unknown source (like a friend) there is nothing to lead to you.  So no news (for the IRS) is good news.  Does that help?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:29:16
I agree, there are so many tech advances on the way.  But each and every one must be tried and true.  The best thing we can do now is rid ourselves of non segwit anything to help the process move forward.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:47
It's all they can do.  They know Bcash is a great dividend for BTC holders and like most we will enjoy the free money each and every time we cash out.  So thanks Bcash dudes!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:15:35
Did you buy in for a quick profit fix?  Or did you buy in to hold your ticket for a trip to the MOON!  You can always hop off the bus Gus, make a new plan Stan, drop off the key Lee and set yourself free.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:41:30
Only if you sell!
@_date: 2019-07-04 02:28:15
Great job, if not for my Son I'd have no possibility of still having dreams in my retirement.  I blew him off the first time he told me of Bitcoin (when it hit $1)  he told me about it again when it hit $1000 and I was hooked!
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:16:07
WTF, do you not read the posts!!!!!!!!!  Only invest what you can cheerfully lose!  So whats the problem?  Enjoy the ride and this time next year remember you almost cancelled your ticket to the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:38
I love it!!
@_date: 2019-07-04 02:36:34
Good move and one you will not regret if you are true to your conviction to hodl!!  Buying BTC is not a single decision but 1000's = every time you look at the price!  So be strong and you will be rewarded.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:30:39
Thank you, I will check it out
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:14:51
Hmmm, OK just curious and thank you
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:43:57
Maybe this is just a temp issue.  The other day I was not even able to login due to such heavy traffic.  Took a few hours to get in.  Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:54:31
nuff said!
@_date: 2019-07-21 10:15:58
Good luck with that you Mother F**kers!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:17:21
Yep, the old saying really seems to fit.  We are going to see some really wild things as btc threatens fiat more and more, so hang tight
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:23
I'm so sorry.  Your post is the kind I regret and feel for more than any.  My Son tried to tell me about BTC when it crossed the $1 mark and I blew him off.  I bought back in later at a much higher, but now a very good price.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:54:14
Thanks to another person on this reddit, changelly really worked great for me.  Thanks and happy new year
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:46:00
1 = Letting miners have a say in upgrades
2 = Thinking Ver is anything but a clown!
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:08:45
I love it!  Never ever expect me to feel sorry for a bunch of BANKSTERS!!!
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:58:42
Did B2X go through with the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:28:49
Hey, I may be stupid, but I think if you were to go forward 3 years (more like 1) you will see that this add has come full circle and is correct again
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:22:52
I think it is very realistic to think btc market cap will exceed 1 trillion by end of 2018 so I predict a price of 60K per coin at end of 2018.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:07:17
I feel pretty dumb but what is HQ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:35:01
That is so dam funny!!  Bcash, Bcash, Bcash!
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:26:41
You deserve every penny.   Man o man, I wish I could see you in person and get an autograph and picture taken.  Thanks for all you do
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:23:39
What a shill site!!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:01:34
Dam, your words ring so loud and so clear!  Thanx 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:12:50
Yep reminds me of what a past boss would say = Fukem, feedem fish heads!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:01:17
Hey if they want to do a play on BTC, let them.  Bitcoin is strong and if any of the alts are strong enough to gather some price traction = a good dividend for you and me as we exchange it for more bitcoin.  i don't know about you but that is the only way now that I can accumulate more BTC.  So let them do what it is they do
@_date: 2018-09-29 06:27:55
What a bullshit F**king FUD post!  Surprised it wasn't from the Bitcoindotcon website
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:52:24
way to go!  Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:04:02
Sorry but after the way they slowed down the Segwit upgrade = Never let miners control upgrades again.  They are paid to mine not think!
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:09:06
In the Medium article = I was glad to see that Bitmain was not a contributor!
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:20:02
Ahh, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:03:35
A sign of the times.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:30:44
Everything I need to know about Coinbase = have you activated Segwit?  So case closed!!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:26:16
Hey, hope you reply to this post.  I have a couple of questions for you.  I have looked at changelly and it looks good.  Have you tried it?  Next and please don't run off but can you tell me a little about you.  Have you been here awhile and have coins, coins coins or like most just trying to join the club.  I have been around since 2014 and sold 60% of my coins for our new house but still have a good stash and with some help am ready to take advantage of my free bcash dividend.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:42:22
Yes, and they say you can't take it with you,lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:43:27
This is all early adopter stuff!  Bitcoin won't really come into its own until market cap is over a Trillion and new layers of tech are added and this will happen soon.  2018 will be a very special year indeed!!
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:36:49
That would be great!!
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:09:38
You know I didn't think of it that way and you are right.  Thanks, I just yesterday cashed in all my bcash for btc and was pretty excited.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:30:24
I don't like some of the things Roger does, but do I think Bcash is bad = NO!  It is a nice dividend alt coin.  Looking forward to one day cashing out the rest of my free Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:09:35
Your Dad is COOL!!
@_date: 2018-09-07 00:17:01
Coinbase has its nose so far up Ver's ASS that they probably want to do a BCH ETF, lol!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:18:25
That is a good place for it and at the same time keeps my Bcash dividend at a good level for future cash out
@_date: 2018-09-08 01:03:37
That is a compliment from the Sh*tcoin crowd!!  Be pround
They "Can't Handle the TRUTH!!"
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:24:00
Is that the current price or average fee per transaction?
@_date: 2018-09-01 00:45:36
You are a true gambler as anyone who shorts Bitcoin is.  I HODL and believe.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:25:49
Yep, we all have our own MOON!!  Good luck on yours
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:07:36
Sad they did so little research on accepting Bitcoin.  To choose Bitpay for the transactions is very sad!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:46:18
Love learning new words "Domme Kut" lol
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:38:26
Very proud of you and your post!  Great luck to you and all your countrymen and women!!
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:33:11
Good post!  I know it is hard for some to enjoy this time.  But I feel it is the best thing that can happen for all of us and Bitcoin.  The next Bull Run wont be stopped by greedy miners fees or slow network times.  We need this time for the evolution of the Bitcoin network to continue.  Good luck to all Hodlers!!!
@_date: 2018-09-05 07:02:17
This article needs to be on Bitcoin.Com = so full of shit!!
Bitmain is bleeding BCH and anyone who invests in this IPO deserves all that they get!  When you lose your ass = F**K you and we don't give a Shit!!
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:07:14
I know this is a dumb question but once you were in control of your Btrash = how did you go about cashing it in or trading it for BTC?  Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:18:58
Good question,  but it is always "First In and First Out" so if you bought 5 btc 2 years ago and 5 more last month and then sold 5 today = the long term capital gains would prevail as the 5 you sold today would come from the first you bought = First In - First Out.  This is the way a financial adviser explained it to me.  Hope it helps
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:41:51
Isn't OpenBazaar a bitmain company? So no thanks!
@_date: 2018-08-06 02:36:45
scam site!!!
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:00:55
lol, that's great.  Thanks for the post
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:28:04
We are not doomed.  We are just beginning and it's still Hadr to do so just Hodl and future tech will make it so much easier.
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:02:36
Gotta love it!!
@_date: 2018-08-31 00:47:06
One Fiat after another!  Bitcoin's day is coming closer and closer.  To all the Hodlers out there - I Salute YOU!!!!
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:38:32
Dam that's a shame!  Please let us know when they wise up and dump Bitpay = anti-bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:10:06
They would have never started to use Segwit or help the bitcoin network in anyway if it were not for the support of this group!!  
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:13:57
As always = Bad new for bitmain is good news for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:18:53
Everyone is going to give you an opinion.  So here is mine.  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose and don't panic when the market goes down.  If you can truly hodl then I believe Bitcoin is the best investment opportunity of our lifetimes.  When I started to invest in Bitcoin I was confronted by 2 choices.  1 = invest all I possibly can and if it goes to "0" I can live with that!  2 = don't invest a dime in this new asset class and if it goes to the moon = I can't live with that!  Always remember what I have told my best friends - Bitcoin can only do 1 of 2 things = it can go to "0" or it will go higher than you can possible imagine.  There is no 3rd option.

UASF is the only reason we have Segwit and the evolution that has followed.  Just a reminder to the community = Miners are paid to mine, not THINK!!!
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:46:19
Yeah, what a pain in the ass!!  As long as you deal in Fiat = you are always going to be a prisoner of the US monetary system!

Customers of Shopify need to let them know that there are better (much better)  options available other than BitPay
@_date: 2018-08-24 22:53:44
I agree that as a company they SUCK!  But I don't want them to go, but rather stand as the company model you don't want to use and why.

All a miner cares about is (Rewards and Fees).  So pay the needed fee and move along.
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:51:52
That's pretty smart!  Sometimes the simplest things make the biggest difference
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:07:54
I so agree!  F**k Ver, Jihan and their buddy's.  The best part of this dip is enjoying Bitmain's blood all over the street!!

Couldn't let this just slide.  Had to join the Trustpilot site to give Ver the 1 Star (Finger) salute he deserves and as you can guess = His paid trolls are trying to raise the bar with fake praising reviews.

This article makes it look like they have actually started to use SegWit.  Is that for real?  I thought they had their nose so far up Ver's ASS that they still had not implemented SegWit!
@_date: 2018-05-02 00:54:04
Doesn't looked fixed to me.  Bitcoin is bitcoin not Bitcoin Core!  F**K You Roger!!

This is not a request for the masses, but for those who want to know what can they do to help the network.

I hate being suckered into looking at the crap Ver puts out!!
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:11:52
Wow, you put a lot of effort into this and for that I say thank you.  I too believe that Bitcoin will do just fine with or without an ETF.  But the easier it is for the masses to invest a portion of their 401-k or IRA into this new asset class is a positive.
@_date: 2018-05-19 03:13:00
It is also fair to say that companies such as Blockchain.info have their nose stuck so far up Ver's A** that they will fight the evolution of Bitcoin to the bitter end!

I'm all for soft forks as long as miners have no say so!  They would never agree to anything that aids the LN.  Miners need to be paid to mine not think!! I don't mean to piss off legit miners, but Bitmain has made me skeptical about mining and their mindset!

What ever coin you put into your savings account is what you will receive each month.  I'm in and so far the experience could not be better.  It really helps to see the btc roll.  Never thought on my fixed income I would ever be able to do some accumulating again on the bitcoin front so this is so far GREAT!!  Thank you BlockFi
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:48:03
I didn't know it either thanks for sharing

@_date: 2019-03-22 03:27:59
Agreed!!  I am in the interest program but only because I'm not a US citizen.

Hello, I have been with blockfi for about a month and did receive my interest statement for the short time it was in the account for February.  I have not withdrawn any = this is a long time hold for me and don't plan on any withdrawals any time soon.  Hope this helps.  I'm on line if you have another question
@_date: 2019-03-11 04:59:53
You are so right!!  I can not give you the source but I will never forget Mr. Buffet as a guest instructor at an Ivy League University (in the 90's).  He told the class that if any of the students in the class has investments in any internet company = He would instantly fail them for the class!  Some things you never forget and Buffet and Tech don't go together!
@_date: 2019-03-29 00:50:33
Thanks for the post.  
@_date: 2019-03-09 23:03:17
Only been a member for about 3 weeks.  Just a hodler so no withdrawals = I look at this as a long time savings account (experiment) to see if it really works.  Had some coin on Blockchain info and wanted it off the site so this looked like an interesting option.  Good luck in all you do
@_date: 2019-11-28 08:57:24
Oh well, everyone can have there own opinion - we will see how it plays out
@_date: 2019-03-06 09:12:55
You will be contacted in another email sent from a 3rd party company  that performs the background checks for BlockFi's customers wanting to open interest bearing savings accounts.  All went smooth for me
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:57:55
Less than 30 minutes I got a verification from Blockfi.  I added a little later and it took a couple of days (I think the delay was due to the weekend)
@_date: 2019-03-29 00:34:41
None!  goes to show that when dealing with Drugs, Terrorism, money laundering ect = you need to do what the pro's do (Banksters) and use the good old USD!

UPDATE!!  OK I wanted to give you my results so far and rating of my experience.
Setting up my account for interest was very easy.  I am not a US citizen.  Once I finished the form to start the account, my information was passed to a 3rd party company who performed the needed background check for verification.
Everything is done in a very quick, orderly and friendly manner = no complaints.
I was approved and given my bitcoin address to forward bitcoin to fund my account.  (Oh as a note, your funds are held on the Gemini exchange).  My funds were verified within minutes after I sent them (a real stress reliever).
My account has only been going for less than a week, I was not expecting to hear back from them till the first week of April for my interest statement, but to my surprise I received my first interest statement for the partial month of February.  All so far is good and I could not ask for a better experience.  
Looking forward to future interest statements and will keep you all up to date to any changes or unexpected surprises.
Rating on this company and activity so far = 5 STARS!!
Makes it fun to be a hodler again.  
Feel free to ask questions

Using the Fold App and Blockfi savings are great way to stack sats for doing what you do anyway.  Hey I get a lot of flack here on Blockfi = so if you don't like it fine!  But so far pays off month after month at 6%

No, there is KYC performed by a 3rd party company.  You will have to submit your details if you want to open an account.  I am not a US citizen so I was not sure if I would be approved - but all went very smooth.

You can check out "Celsius".  They claim to pay out interest paid in BTC for your BTC deposit.  Sounds very interesting, You get paid 1 BTC for every 20 you have in deposit (for 12 month period).  For a holder this sounds like a dream come true.  My problem is that old saying = if it sounds too good to be true!!!  Anyone tried them yet?

Hey thank you very much for the update.  Even though I was allowed to sign up for the program as a Philippine citizen, I found out later that the program was only open for US citizens - that's why I never got paid.  Looking very forward to the expansion of the program and excited about the "Fold App" (not yet available for me here in the PH) as well.  Thanks again and good luck to us all

I must agree with you and time to get past my feelings of Ver and Bitmain.  They are not worthy of it
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:04:18
Bitcoin has never been hacked!  An exchange is not Bitcoin and is only as secure as its security.  So once again you hear the truth = if you don't own the keys, you don't own the Bitcoin.

Was there ever a dougt?  FORK NO!
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:36:03
I need to help clarify this for our readers.  Sure it is easy as hell to buy and sell bitcoin in the Philippines and all the exchanges will brag about "No Fees". But what they don't tell you is the exchange rate is bad!  The price to buy will be jacked up about $300 US per bitcoin and the sale price will be lower by about $300 US as well.  So when you skew the price by that much = who needs F**king fees?  I know that coinbase can be a bitch but looking forward to it here in the Philippines and it will force these local exchanges to come down to earth in their so called no fee rates.
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:27:50
This really took GUTS to show the kind of company "Fold" is and will be as they mature into a great asset for the Bitcoin community.  Bravo for you!

Fold - With Ver on your team, this speaks volumes as to your company at heart!  I had such high hopes for Fold and the Fold concept of business and I still do = it will just have to be with another company when the time comes along.

Libra is great for one thing!  Bitcoin is small and central banks and countries of the world can dismiss it for now.

I love it

Right now BTC is doing exactly what it needs to do.  A nice slow trend where the network can handle the action, while allowing the 2nd layer action and tech improvements to happen (it takes time).  Man this is great.

@_date: 2019-06-02 06:58:00
Sounds great but as you can see from some of the comments = you have really brought out the Btrash shills here!
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:08:24
Dam, thanks for the update.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:00:56
Wow, I can see now a problem buying that huge burger at one of the stalls and its called "The Suicide Bomber" lol
@_date: 2019-02-11 02:07:56
Yeah, I try not to read any links from that site.  But I live in the Philippines and enjoyed the article.  This country is very open to Bitcoin and its use and potential.  I don't see any link or crap from Ver here.  
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:48:14
Thanks for all the comments.  If we learned anything from the 2017 Bull Run = A mempool over 250,000 and fees over $50 just kills a rally
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:10:12
Don't like it!  Bought 2 of them, 1 overheated and never would trust any coin to them again.  
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:51:31
A Prowler is so cool, drive it down any crowded street then drive a Lambo down the same street a few minutes later and I bet it is a tie or win for the Prowler on head turns.  Oh and one costs only a couple of BTC at todays prices and can be serviced in any town in the US, sorry for going on, but I do like them
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:25:01
I don't worry about that.  If anyone (country or government) could do such a thing = they already would, some of their very lives depend on it!  Oh but very good advice on lightning.  Thanks
@_date: 2019-06-13 02:45:04
If you can afford it - YES!!
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:16:38
Really, which one allows this action and any documentation on doing so?  Thanks
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:43:13
Wow, me too.  When BTC moons = I'll figure out something different, but for now paper is king.
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:24:05
Hey you took the words right out of my mouth!!  I don't know or care who Sam is = Fu*k the dude!!
@_date: 2019-02-14 05:26:47
Just checking this out made me come up with a new prediction for Bitcoin and the LN.  One day all new phones, tablets and any general computer equipment tied to the internet will come pre-loaded with a LN node.  You will just configure or shall I say customize with your own info and your set to go.  Just a thought
@_date: 2019-06-02 06:51:10
No, as old as I am, I'm afraid to add extra layers of security and not being able to access the files again.  Just me!
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:22:27
Thank you for the help, I missed it.  If you find a replay of the show please let me know and thanks again

@_date: 2019-06-02 02:22:18
I used to store seeds in a safe deposit box, but all that does is make is ever so handy if and when the government wants to confiscate the data = your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:25:15
Man I wish that was an option, but its not.  Hoping companies that are now putting in low earth satellites will make that possible for all.  Thanks for the input.  Yeah man no Hughes net here, lol
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:23:48
For now at least so the miners can not stop the next real Run!  Thanks
@_date: 2019-02-20 23:57:32
Thank you the Silver my friend!!!
@_date: 2019-02-20 05:46:57
I don't think it will be what we now think of as a full node.  More like a light - very light node that will be able to work in the background = out of site, out of mind.  Just me thinking.  Good luck to you
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:59:27
This is the guy you want in charge of your security dept.
@_date: 2019-02-18 01:55:45
Anyone out there truly believe this isn't a theft or scam?  This guy needs to be hunted down along with any and all who could possible be involved and have "Jack Bauer" interrogate the hell out of them.  Hey, your money is available, you just need the right incentive to recover it.  Sorry to all Quadriga customers and good luck = Just one old guy's opinion!!
@_date: 2019-02-21 04:28:03
Ahh, another Ver investment is paying off!! 
@_date: 2019-02-11 01:51:46
Thanks for the info, I'll check it out
@_date: 2019-04-14 04:23:55
I found this maybe it will help you.
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:53:12
You are right.  Companies using the bitcoin blockchain for their own benefit need to pay out the ASS!!  Thats why I'm all for having high minimum fees for onchain transactions.
@_date: 2019-06-14 00:52:11
Scam artist of coke friends?  Dam dude get off the Fox and CNN news and be a part of the solution!   I will enjoy down voting this piece of SH*T post!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-04-26 04:05:11
Great post!  Tether needs its own reddit along with other shit coins.  If you leave your bitcoin stash on any exchange = we don't care or want to hear about it when its hacked and gone.
@_date: 2019-04-26 02:14:46
Hey your welcome, glad to share and hope all works out.
@_date: 2019-04-08 02:03:19
I don't trust or want anything to do with a company that partners with Bitmain.  
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:44:55
Thanks I'll check it out.  Good luck to us all
@_date: 2019-04-15 04:19:15
Now, now, now.  If Satoshi happened to be Ver or Wu, I'd agree with you
@_date: 2019-04-30 01:54:55
Sounds great and when you check out the link = more wallet integration coming.  Hey I agree - Coinbase sucks but looks like another good thing in the works and will wait till other wallet options are available
@_date: 2019-04-04 03:20:32
OK, but if the mempool fills like it did during the last bull run - transactions can take hours and the fees are so high = A coin that does not work.  Thanks for the comment and good luck in all you do
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:38:10
Dam this website is so bad = Ver must own it too!!
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:05:31
Good!!  Bad news from China is always good new for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-04-26 02:16:49
Thanks for the reply, I'll keep you up to date when I hear back and you do the same.  Anything that keeps the buying pressure on bitcoin seems like a good idea.
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:51:34
Wow, I was right.  I got the same message the other day, but I get so many complaints from the noobs here lately about anything I post so I just blocked the user.  Thanks for the confirmation
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:40:41
F**k China and the Bitmain they rode in on!!
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:28:44
I'm all for it if the transactions can happen off chain using LN or the likes
@_date: 2019-04-28 03:37:43
Buy all you can afford, avoid shitcoins and hold till it reaches your moon
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:57:40
I love it, bad news for China is always good news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-29 02:35:53
Cool, thanks for posting
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:02:09
Who do you really think the backdoor is for?  NSA!!!
@_date: 2019-04-20 11:35:01
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-17 06:54:54
May be good for bitcoin, but when I saw they will use bitpay to handle the payments = I won't be using this company for any of my bitcoin action
@_date: 2019-04-10 08:28:56
Very nice, congrats
@_date: 2019-04-29 02:45:57
I agree.  UASF was a great success but will probably never be needed again!  We all learned so much = never let miners decide again on anything!  Miners are paid to mine not think!
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:43:59
Thanks I'll check it out.  Good luck to us all
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:37:51
I agree, anyway I can spend fiat and get bitcoin rewards on the side is a win, win.
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:01:16
I agree that high fees are great for bitcoin.  There needs to be a BIP for set minimum fees at least $1 and go up every year.  This is a win win for bitcoin = miners get the fees and companies have incentive to do as much business as possible off the main chain.  LN fees are super low so if business use it = even the poor unbanked in the world who truly need bitcoin in their life can still afford the fees.  Any company or mining pool who spam the bitcoin network need to pay out the ASS!!!! Oh and to your question to block size - I'm all for Lukes 300k block size and that will do fine when everything that can be moved to LN is moved.  The smaller the blocks the easier it is to run and maintain a full node
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:40:32
Now your talking!  and like your name says "Piss on China"
@_date: 2019-04-07 00:39:36
I never heard of bitcoinwisdom.io until yesterday when you or another mentioned it and it is great for me = Thank you 
@_date: 2019-04-28 03:41:21
Take this chance to do what you have been told over and over and over and over and over and over and over again!  Get your bitcoin off exchanges or keep playing with fire
@_date: 2019-04-20 11:41:45
Don't get me wrong, Thailand is really nice.  But no matter who you are or where you go = you must respect that country's laws or you might find yourself in a world of hurt.  Good luck in all you do
@_date: 2019-04-27 01:54:35
lol, that's great, thanks for the laugh
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:45:28
Hmmm, this sounds like a commercial for "Tumblers"
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:27:58
OK, you asked and here is my true feelings.  In December when the price was going higher and higher the network couldn't handle all the action and so fees were sky high and network delays were long.  Now things have slowed down which I feel is great = giving the network the time it needs to build and evolve so the next bull run won't be more than the network can handle and off we go.  Just me talking for what its worth.
@_date: 2018-11-06 23:46:54
I had to do a double take when reading the trash.  Thought it surely was a post from Bitcoindotcom.  You can tell it really hurts to post anything positive only wanting to push the negative!
@_date: 2018-03-10 07:15:21
Thanks for the dividend "Ver"!  So glad when I was able to dump this btrash shitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:29:33
Some folks on here say we BITCH, YELL, SCREAM and RANT too much.  I say it works and this is proof.  Without this reddit we would still be hoping for Segwit.  Let the good prevail and the rest be dammed!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-14 02:34:00
Bad news in China is always good for bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:07:25
Just a thought, if the VM server is $70 per month and you say many stores can use the same account or server = can you not all share the cost to maybe bring the monthly charge to nearly "0"?  Just wondering.  Oh and great post
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:40:21
This sub is how companies like Coinbase, Bitpay, Bitmain, Bitcoin.com and on and on are exposed for what they are.  No one else is going to do it, and as this reddit grows so does the strength in bringing the bad apples in the bitcoin community to light.
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:30:53
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:22:10
Sounds great and thanks for the update.  Good luck to you and all
@_date: 2018-03-24 02:54:56
If you use Bitpay = You deserve all the F**king your going to get!  So bend over!
@_date: 2019-01-04 05:09:05
Good words.  
@_date: 2018-11-11 14:37:02
Use the courts in China, maybe they care!! lol
@_date: 2018-03-25 05:42:00
very interesting link.  If I ever have good internet here in the PH I will run a full node
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:00:04
If the poll would have been - How many of your friends, family and relatives own bitcoin = the result would still have been correct for me.   Only 2 
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:45:58
Am i correct in my thoughts that one of the best things about a decentralised exchange is no "KYC"
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:32:28
Thanks for posting, even if dates are a guess.  It's great to see what happening in the Bitcoin world.  
@_date: 2018-03-24 04:58:10
Looks like you really struck a nerve with Jihads whore = Cobra
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:45:56
coming from you that is great news!
@_date: 2019-01-10 05:08:25
Am I wrong, this seems like very troubling news!  The Bitcoin community with "UASF" the lightening network and so many new tech ideas being developed to lighten the load on the blockchain network and now we have those who are able to increase network traffic with pure crap!!  Is it just my imagination?  Can this be stopped?  Can a soft fork be done so that any transaction not tied to bitcoin would have a very high fee?  If they want to play let them PAY!!
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:45:45
Your doing good!  You just f**ked another millionaire from owning his or her own full bitcoin!!
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:01:54

Hey this table seems right on here from the Philippines.  This is one of the most friendly BTC countries with many options for cashing in your BTC into the local cash!

Always interesting to see this.  Thanks for posting
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:32:27
Congrats, congrats!  I love the fact that if every millionaire wanted to own just 1 bitcoin = they are out of luck!
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:17:57
when 1 bitcoin can buy my second passport = F**k the USA
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:04:07
Hmmmm, I would have to be on your side for that bet.  Good luck to you!

What a pleasant thought - Jihad Wu in his grave!
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:24:44
With the coming of layer 2 tech like the LN.  It won't be long and the fees will be less than 1% for any size transaction.  At least this is my understanding of events to come.
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:59:31
Ver works in mysterious ways!  
@_date: 2018-03-12 06:32:49
Maybe they just don't want anyone to confuse a shitcoin (btrash) for the real deal!  Either that or Ver owns a piece of this company
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:51:46
Anything to do with Ver or Jihad is to be avoided, at least by me!
@_date: 2018-03-25 05:46:48
Must agree with most others here.  Beware of anything Ver or Jihan touches!
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:28:38
Yes Sir!  I have gone back and forth on this and it will happen.  Only a matter of when.  Good luck to you and thank you from the Philippines

@_date: 2019-09-23 03:19:15
Good!!  I don't feel sorry one F**king bit for anyone dealing with Bitpay anymore than those dealing with Ver!
@_date: 2019-09-04 06:51:08
Ver and his F**king SHILLS will be going all in on this one.  I can see voting farms in India lighting up the internet, scamming every dam dime they can out of this exchange.

Bitcoin isn't a way to end wars.  But it will give the people the choice of having a war.  Bitcoin can change the way government works = instead of the people serving the government, the government will serve the people.  Only time will tell

@_date: 2019-05-27 01:01:16
your thinking short term.  Bitcoin only has 2 possibilities for the future
1 - goes to "0"
2 - goes higher than you can ever imagine.
This only ends one way.

Yep, remember a sucker is born every minute.  All we can do is try to keep the regular non suspecting folks our their from being scammed.

There's no chance of that.  Too many people want and need it.  More and more everyday.  The LN will make bitcoin the universal currency.  Not long from now every company and every cell phone will run a LN node in the background.  Supply is cut every 4 years = supply and demand.  So staying the same is not an option.  This isn't a stock.  It's a way of life.  Only 2 options.  you decide.
@_date: 2019-05-24 03:40:43
I am truly bullish about the LN.  It is still in its infancy but will continue to grow exponentially, eventually becoming the worlds main payment network.  So that said the comments here are very good = keep things small and allow yourself to grow along with the LN

Looked good till I saw Wu.  Don't want to be anywhere around that AHole unless it's his wake!!
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:49:23
Yes, with no regrets or hesitation

backed up as PDF's = paper and flash drive
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:53:59
Thanks for the update.  I will give them all the time I feel like is needed to complete the transaction and then will report to our reddit members the results.  If a company is good and true or false and a scam.  Hopefully good and true.  Good luck in all you do.  Oh, so far BlockFi is working great, just to say

These kind of posts prove to me that hardware wallets are still not safe enough for me.  One day maybe in a couple of years it will be time to change my cold storage options.  Thanks for the post
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:44:49
Pretty cool, but good F**king LUCK!!  Mine will never be for sale all at one time for a bunch of FIAT SH*T!!
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:35:37
Very proud and thankful for life in the Philippines.
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:26:30
Wow, thanks for all the info.  I think I'll just have to figure out what to do when I see the moon getting close.  For now paper, PDF's and flash drives will do the trick
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:26:03
Good video, at least he is talking sense and letting folks out there know its a risk but the rewards are there
@_date: 2019-05-23 04:57:59
that was good thanks for the laugh.  do you have a hardware wallet?  if so do you like it and why.
@_date: 2019-05-23 01:44:33
I know and I don't go out of my to talk people into bitcoin anymore.  I let them all know about it but only one friend ever took me up on it.  Thanks for the post
@_date: 2019-05-21 03:58:39
Dam this is great, more and more.  Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:38:24
no, no, no.  first never have used an exchange.  PDF's are my paper wallets, backed up with flash drives in those kind of special hidden spots in case of who knows what.  When I trust and understand hardware wallets better (after moon is reached) I will change over.  Thanks and good luck to you and all

This should be on Wiki as definition of a "Shit Coin"
@_date: 2019-05-16 08:51:25
Blockchain.com, info ect have their noses so far up Ver's Ass they will drag out anything they can which benefits the Bitcoin network and their clients.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:58:01
I have often tried to find out = conversions for shit ton?  Maybe someone here can help clarify this for me, lol
@_date: 2019-05-23 01:43:02
It makes for a very exciting life.  Thanks and good luck in all you do
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:08:35
Anything to do with Ver's website is anti bitcoin.  There's so many options out there, if your into shitcoins then you have the correct place to go.  Don't take a chance on it.
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:25:06
Thanks for the post, how do you tag trolls?
@_date: 2019-05-16 10:10:15
Hey, why do you think they call it a "Sh*tcoin"?
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:11:45
Dam, what a great post for information.  This deserves to be rewarded.  Sorry that I'm old and don't know how to tip.  Thanks very much
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:20:37
I'm retired so when it hits my moon, I will just enjoy spending on travel and leisure.  Fiat is trash to me, just a ways to an end.  It won't be long and you will be able to buy and use bitcoin for your every need and want.  You will never have to convert it and loose on the exchange rate for everywhere you want to use it will be accepted.  Cool
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:48:53
You know that Mark Twain was really F**king Great!  I am a true holder in the ups and the downs.  That is until bitcoin reaches my moon.  I know that I can never afford to again buy bitcoin and I'll be damned if I let someone else buy mine at these super, super low prices.  Good luck in all you do.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:20:23
Bitcoin is the driving force for technology evolution in security and privacy.  The more pressure put on crypto = the more secure it becomes, so bring it on!!!
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:41:18
I want the average US citizen to be able to use their IRA or 401-K to easily put some retirement money into Bitcoin.  Wow, a Roth of bitcoin could be a dream come true for many.  Just my thoughts
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:56:39
I'd hate to settle for such a low price
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:44:24
My Son put it in to wise words = To own Bitcoin is not just one decision but a thousand decisions, one every time you look at the price.  Hodl till your moon is reached, it will be reached!
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:00:46
Once you give the gift to a non US citizen = she can do with it as she wishes, after all it's hers and the US can go F**K itself!
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:40:15
Approval for a Bitcoin ETF has nothing to do with bitcoin but everything to do with those that control the SEC!  The Rich protect the Rich and will do any and everything possible to keep you down and in your place!  Bitcoin ownership is the greatest thing you can do to protect and lift you and yours to a higher level!  Never be swayed, HODL!!!
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:00:21
Hmmmm, this is really F**ked up!!  Wont be long and 1 bitcoin will buy my freedom.  A new passport is tops on my want list.  Good luck to all of you back in the US
@_date: 2019-05-18 13:43:04
Always glad you ask, just checked and NO!  I will give them plenty of time but will not use again until paid.  How about you.  The reddit community will hear from me one way or the other.  I still have high hopes
