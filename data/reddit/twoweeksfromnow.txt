Yeah BCH has 0.20 fees... Along with about 700 other altcoins. Not many people are buying coffee with their bitcoin not cause the fees are too high but just because they don't want to buy coffee with their bitcoin or any crypto yet, the incentive isn't globalised yet, even if bitcoin fees were nil this would be the case. I'm not saying we won't get their because we will but right now, 2017? It just isn't it if people really wanted to buy coffees or whatever with crypto right now theres about 1000 coins to choose from and about 995 of those still remain unused.
Edit: hope I'm not misunderstanding your point by the way, forgive me if I am.

Downloads have nothing to do with the point, I only used Samurai as an example. There are many wallets that have successfully implemented Segwit that have a much smaller dev team than CB.

It's a test net wallet at the moment, so you can only load it with test net BTC so you can play around with lightning before release. When the LN is complete there will be a few different wallets to choose from across Android, IOS and desktop. As far as I can tell LN is pretty much ready but they're making sure everything is perfect securitywise which is why it isn't live on main net yet. Protecting user funds is the most important thing. 
And yes, the idea is you use your hardware wallet as your banks and keep day to day amounts on your mobile wallet. BTC is awesome indeed, and with Lightning it will [change the world.](

I'm a long term holder, and do not plan to "Dump" Bitcoin for some of us isn't just a get rich quick scheme. You know you can spend bitcoin directly right? And some people are paid in bitcoin directly for work? Would you ever dump dollars? Or euros? Or pounds? (then again I guess people *are* dumping those currencies for bitcoin) point is bitcoin is supposed to be a new financial instrument for some of us.
Let's put it this way (10 years from now), imagine bitcoin is $500,000 per coin, why should I sell my bitcoin for cash only to buy a house a car and some gadgets from Amazon, when I can buy a house with my bitcoin, buy a car with my bitcoin and spend bitcoin directly on Amazon? (take a look at Overstock.com and STEAM, they both accept bitcoin payments directly)

This actually proves he has ulterior motives when it comes to "forking cuz muh high fees", he has expressed in the past he wants to see multiple versions of bitcoin. At this rate I don't actually expect to see Coinbase impliment Segwit this year **or next**. What I think will happen instead, Coinbase plans to push and promote BCash as direct competition (not in the same way they have don't with LTC/ETH on their platform).
He (Coinbase) are acting recklessly and out of either sheer greed or stubbornness or both. They are happy BCH is a thing, they are happy we don't have LN yet and they are not going to anything to help aid the situation, this includes adding Segwit. This is a political game for them and proves why Bitcoin needs to stay **as decentralised as possible**. These central actors will only seek to further themselves, unfortunately this is human nature.

Well he's not wrong in the short term, **if we continue to follow the current trend** it's pretty much guaranteed we will be somewhere between 15-20k by Christmas. It's not a guarantee the current trend will continue till then though.
Don't have the numbers in front of me but going by (I think) the last 90 day performance we should be at about $25k by February. I wouldn't be surprised if this run slows a little in the short term though.

And even if the fees were not high, it would not change the situation in Venezuela. There are 1000s of altcoin with next to 0 cost in fees and none of those are booming anywhere, like literally no where.
And your reply to my comment doesn't make much sense, I did not imply bitcoin.com is contributing to bitcoin having high fees, only that they benefit because they have a product to push. My point is you mentioning high fees having something to with why Bitcoin isn't working in Venezuela is wrong because Venezuelans are not using crypto in general they are using USD because they are paid in USD. You posting me a link to that commercial site doesn't change that fact. 
I was going to ignore the core comment too but I thought what the heck why not. Core raising the blocksize to 2mb/8mb whatever wouldn't change a thing because simply raising the blocksize  **does not work for long term scaling.** key word here is **long term**. Raising the blocksize now has more cons than pros. We want a global digital currency not just another payment processor, **Not** PayPal 2.0.

I think we need to remember Coinbase supported a fork (even with all the warnings and red flags) that had pretty much 1, yes **one** developer which had it gone ahead would more than likely had crashed the network and the price.

Would you tell your friends (or strangers on the Internet) exactly how much you have in your bank account? For all we know that. 1, 1 or 1000 could be worth millions in a few years (remember it wasn't too long ago someone bought a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins).
People will kill for money, this isn't new. Especially for something like bitcoin, imagine Somone pinned you down today and tortured you untill you sent them your bitcoin, how do you get it back? You could send it to them and they send it half way across the planet in 10mins and it's gone for good.
Telling people how much bitcoin you have is like telling them how much cash you have under your bed or how much money you have in your bank account.

Highly doubt they are using altcoins, most Venezuelans that have commented on r/bitcoin have stated its much easier using USD at the moments not because of the fees involved with crypto but because many are paid in USD they use that same USD to keep their households operating weekly, on ramp onto crypto (not just Bitcoin) just isn't easier enough right now out their.
Even if this wasn't the case, there is a tiny tiny tiny percentage of merchants that even know about bitcoin and crypto let alone accepting it as a payment method, and there is a ridiculously smaller amount that even know about altcoins.

Well my advice would be to give Trevor back his wallet. Not cool man. ^^/s
You can play with LN yourself right now on Testnet, also the example used in the video is a WordPress LN plugin so Alice with her spare time t-shirt store/fashion blog could set up lightning payments likely within minutes. 
I can't speak for Trezor but I don't imagine it would be difficult for hardware wallets to add, but even if I am wrong you probably wouldn't use your hardware wallet for day to day payments anyway, hardware wallets are for long term storage. You would want to use a hot wallet for lightning payments, many of which are currently in development, the hotwallet used in the video is the Eclaire wallet which is available now on the Android Playstore for testnet. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:52:40
Bitcoin today is not the same bitcoin it was 8 years ago, 8 years ago there were no hardware wallets, or legitimate exchanges or Payment processors etc etc things are alot more smoother since then, yes fees are a little, no a lot higher, this is a problem, but it's a good problem to have because on the other hand we could be on low fees &amp; the same amount of users as we had 8 years ago (a couple hundred people? Thousand at best? If that), the fees show bitcoins use is growing especially considering people are actually paying them, with this said
8 years from now, Bitcoin will not look how it looks today, fees will be far far cheaper, transactions will be instant and we will have technologies built on top of the bitcoin Blockchain that we can't even imagine today. 
*(I'm not saying it will take 8 years for fees to become cheaper, truth is by this time next year I imagine bitcoins growth will make the last 8 years look like a stand still)*

Prediction. Inside trading. 
Coinbase plan to announce a *possible* go-ahead with 2X. (regardless of what users or market wants, however they will spin the story as "This is what the market has demanded" however when they say "Market" they mean Themselves BTCC and a few other miners) 
They announce this when we a just shy of $9k and crash the price. This or the announcement comes in a few days.

@_date: 2017-11-07 11:02:04
I think they believe that they somehow represent the customers that use their services. I'm sure u/evoorhees mentioned this somewhere.
How that works though I have no idea, as I use several services offered by some of the signers of the NYA and do not support S2X nor do I feel they represent me and like you mentioned the users that do not follow the technical debate let's say the average Joe, mom &amp; pop of coinbase couldn't care less about 1mb, 2mb, Hardforks, Scaling or whatever.
The whole point of S2X was apparently to avoid a chain split and bring the community together. Instead bitcoin split August 1st and now we are about to split again.
A handful of charismatic leaders should not be able to come together in a business meeting and change the direction of bitcoin.
The power of deciding what bitcoin is or isn't shouldn't be left to miners **especially** when there is a Miner centralisation problem.
Most of the NYA parties seem to me to be in denial at this point, they would rather split the chain than admit that there isn't consensus for the fork they are advocating. They continue to call us the vocal minority but last time I checked the futures market it seems *most* people think B2X will be a bag of sand. 
I'm yet to see a **community** come out in support of the HF, In fact the only community that seem to want it is a group of businessmen and a hand full of 2 week old reddit accounts. 
**Hey, didn't we have a 1.6mb block the other day or am I mistaken?**
This whole thing is a shit show, the main developer of S2X promoting an altcoin whilst claiming bitcoin is known for its Hardfork and developer drama, drama which he helped create? 
They have next to no nodes that support the change, we already have blocks bigger than 1mb and Bitcoin already split into BCH, 
**If they are so sure there is a silent majority, and everyone wants this change that they have come together to push, they should add replay protection.**

Any ideas? You kidding? The price also rose $1K I didn't see anyone looking for any strict reasoning. I don't mean to sound like an ass, (and sincerely hope I'm not misunderstanding your question) but Bitcoin is volatile and that isn't anything new (corrections are expected after such big jumps). Try not to think about it in $ moves but instead % moves.
Its like no one complains when the price jumps hundreds of dollars in minutes but when it dips some people begin to question their reality.
The BTC/USD value isn't going to get to $100k in a straight line up.

Ethereums ship has sailed on thar front already, it will never be recognised as digital gold/cash or a store of value since it has lost its immutability, among other things. This isn't an issue though as Ethereum was never created to compete against bitcoin in this aspect. I'm not saying Ethereum will survive or fail, just that it was created to serve a different purpose. Ethereum is simply supposed to be a token.

I think that BTC is BTC, these guys are free to fork off if they want, but as it stands there isn't strong support from users that agree with their fork so they should add replay protection if they don't agree with BTC as it stands.
2X won't replace the main chain. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:22:44
Don't worry, many people before you have bought at the ATHs and experienced dips right afterwards. Holding through this dip will make give you stronger hands in future. This isn't the first dip we have had and In fact we have dropped and recovered much further in the past.
I reckon things will start getting back to a somewhat normal state some time Monday once BCH difficulty adjusts, could still be another few weeks but my Crystal ball still tells me $10k by Christmas.

Because telling people how much money you have makes you a potential target.
Would you tell people how much money you have in the bank? Its the same thing, only this time you control your money not a bank, so depending on what measures you have taken to you secure your bitcoin it may be easier to steal from you than it would be your bank.
And that's regardless how many bitcoin you have, what you make consider a small amount now may be a ridiculously large amount in a few years.
Do not tell people how much money you have. Bitcoin or not. Period.
Edit: do yourself a favour, if you haven't already. Buy a Trezor or a Ledger Nano S. They're hardware wallets and are currently the best method of protecting your coins. Even if the device is damaged lost or stolen you will still have access to your bitcoin with one. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:29:54
Why are you taking **Good** Satoshi in the literal way?
I did answer the question you challenged me on, now it seems we are going around in circles.
Maybe I should edit my original comment to say *"It's a high probability the coins will not move, either indefinitely or in the near future"* if it would make you feel better, as much as I believe it's much more likely that the keys are lost. 
If you are unable to read between the lines of my two comments, I don't have time to explain them. Enjoy your day. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:05:50
Gemini or Coinbase are easiest options.
I would also take the time to research *Hardware wallets* and the importance of controlling your private keys.
Also you can visit coinatmradar.com to see if there are any Bitcoin ATMs near your location if you want your bitcoin ASAP, but Bitcoin ATMs usually charge a premium similar to traditional ATMs.

This is also one way to create true holders.
All the weak hands selling now (especially the ones emotional enough to sell BTC for BCH) will be back in a few weeks having sold BCH at a loss and bought BTC back at a new ATH, during the next dip those same sellers will have much bigger balls having learned their lesson.

@_date: 2017-11-20 01:28:17
If you wait for the "correction" you will potentially see the price go from $8000 to $8700 then the dip you were waiting for finally comes then bitcoin looses like 25% of its value what feels like an overnight period then you will say to your self "it must be dying, I'm not buying now, I would be crazy to buy it right now" then the price shoots up to $10,000 then you finally buy in a lot higher than you initially wanted to.
The best way to buy, is to dollar cost average. If you have $1000 you want to buy with, do $250 a week or $100 a week. Even if it's $100 you have do $10 a week. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:57:49

You need to up your numbers. Under $10k is child's play. I think everyone seriously underestimates the distance BTC will go once we pass $10k
I remember when r/bitcoin posted memes about passing $100 milestones once we [legitimately] passed $1000, $100 increments became non-events. If we can pass $100 we can pass $1000, if we can pass $1000 we can pass $5000, if $5000 - $10,000, if $10,000 $50,000.

It's possible that's what both we as an audience and Neo were lead to believe, when it's quite possible Zion was just another level to the matrix and not the real world at all. Dream within a dream sort of thing. Not to dive off topic but I think the pump and dump happening now is a non event and it's getting more attention than it deserves. Most people know what's happening right now, head to twitter and ask any BCH supporters what the last thing they bought with BCH was, almost none of them can.
Almost all transactions are taking place on exchanges and more than 50% of volume is coming from one exchange. Together with Roger &amp; Co dumping large amounts of BTC for BCH and all the charismatic supporters of BCH that were no where to be seen last week when BCH was ~$250 suddenly trying to convince people to sell their BTC and buy BCH at a high. Jihan &amp; Co taking advantage of BCH EDA which will be fixed in a few hours and apparently we're going to see the birth of BCH Classic in a few days.

If you're not mentally prepared to hold on through potential 20-80% dips/corrections on the road to $100k you may as well get your Fiat back. I would advise you to check the price history of the road from $0 - $10k, it has its ups and downs it doesn't go up in a straight line even though it seems like it does sometimes. Check this subs post history from just a few weeks ago when the price dipped 30%, *A lot* of people bought BTC at like $7000 for the first time thinking they were geniuses then the price dipped to $5k and people started **panic selling**, holders that have been here a while were doing the opposite they were **buying the dip** and all those that panic sold at $5k and lost like $2k with balls in their hands bought back in at $7k+ again.
Considering how much bitcoin you have now, I would recommend buying a hardware wallet (*see, Trezor or Ledger Nano S*). This way you control your private keys (meaning no third party owns your coins e.g Coinbase), even if the device is damaged, lost or stolen your bitcoins are safe. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:25:41
That was my initial assumption, but I'm confused as it seems the general view most people have is that it will have a positive influence on the price and not just by people on this sub. I first thought it would either be a negligible or negative impact on price.

If you plan to get more than a few hundred $, it's worth looking into a getting a hardware wallet, do your research on them but best on the market are Ledger Nano S or Trezor.
The beauty of a hardware wallet wallet is not only do you control your private keys, even if the device is lost/damaged/stolen your bitcoin are still safe. They're actually really amazing.
But if you only plan to get a few dollars worth to play around with a mobile wallet is fine.

It's 2.6 now, and I believe only because r/Btc has chimed in to give it 5star reviews. Roger's loyal subordinates would rather help prop up his scam wallet and welcome risking new users loosing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:41:35
It's definitely him, we must remember he was gaming everyone (Roger &amp; Co) the whole time, Jihan is definitely for Bitcoin **But** he is more concerned with short term profits (he does have a business to run) rather than bitcoin itself. 
Roger is a very very emotional character so it's no surprise he's been taken advantage of. All he's doing is loosing would be smaller bitcoiners money and giving it to Jihan. 
BCH is definitely a pump &amp; dump, I don't know how high it will go before the dump but it will definitely nose dive during BTCs run to $10k.

Tip. Don't tell people on the Internet how much money you have even if its in Bitcoin.
Tip. Cost average. Buy more (larger) during dips but buy small amounts either weekly or monthly.
Tip. Don't go crazy with it. Make sure you understand the technology before converting your GBP into Bitcoin. Edit: &amp; not any more than you could afford to loose. 
Tip. Remember if you do hold bitcoin, you should do so for the long term. You may just thank yourself when you're 20.

You can buy tiny amounts. There are 1,000,000 bits to a bitcoin and they divide up even further than that.
You can buy as little as $5 worth of bitcoin I believe.

They are still considering 2X even with a lack of consensus from the community, which now includes the companies represented by those that signed yesterday's 2X withdrawal statement.

This will be the case for the first few forks. Some suggest 2018 will signal the year of the hard fork, but for every altcoin created via hard fork it dilutes the last and lessens the next. People will stop taking Hardforks to altcoins seriously, especially if 2X fails.
Bitcoin needs to go through this to further mature and strengthen. Lessons will be learned. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:51:47
It's not the second most valuable, but either way it only has value because it was an airdrop and every holder prior to August 1st received BCash too.

But if you want a serious answer, I expect we will end the year between $10k-12k, by the end of 2018 providing nothing catastrophic happens Bitcoin could well be somewhere between $25k-$100k

I think they are planning a "Clashic" style coup.
Them saying they are monitoring the situation and market etc is really them saying "Our meetings have not concluded yet we will let you know what direction bitcoin will be taking soon"
They **do not** give a shit about what users or the market wants, they are literally only trying to benefit themselves, why? Because that's what suits do. Short term profits over longevity.
Brian couldn't give a shit if the price crashed as he likely sold most of his Btc for eth we are on the road to 10$k and these donuts are trying to tank the price.
Even more important than price, thet can't see more than 2 feet in front of them at the scaling technologies right at our doorsteps, Coinbase hasn't even implemented Segwit yet! Even Samurai wallet had it sorted only a few  weeks (if that) after activation.

Worried about what? Do you plan to sell at 8000? Don't worry. we may even dip to $6500 which is a signal to buy more. Bitcoin will be $10k by January so who cares what happens in between then?
Better yet, Bitcoin will be $100k in a few short years so again who cares what happens in between then?
You would have been worried if you bought at $1000, Bitcoin would later show you there was actually nothing to worry about.
You would have been worried if you bought at $2000, Bitcoin would later show you there was actually nothing to worry about
You would have been worried if you bought at $3000, Bitcoin would later show you there was actually nothing to worry about
You would have been worried if you bought at $4000, Bitcoin would later show you there was actually nothing to worry about
And so on and so on, do you think we came straight up from 0 to $7800? There's a reason people see bitcoin both as a Rollercoaster and a Honeybadger. Bitcoin don't give a fuck about anyone's feelings. if you're scared it means you bought more than you are comfortable loosing in which case I say sell your Bitcoin now and buy back when we are at $100k and people don't even notice dips anymore &amp; volatility is at a level you are more comfortable with because if there's anything you should know Bitcoin promises nothing but a wild ride. Enjoy the rollercoaster or exit the theme park.
Remember my comment, $10k by January 2018 then we will witness a bubble that will make this bull run and 2013s look like bath time soap suds, then we will witness a correction, then we will stabilise, at which point we will be somewhere between $25k-$50k.

Save this comment, I can guarantee if we pass $7500 we will run through into the $8000 within days of that happening. Breaking $9000 will be harder than breaking $8000. A run past $7500 will cause FOMO and especially from all those that panic sold during the bloodshed last week.

No, usually I don't, it's money she wasn't expecting and money she didn't mind throwing away. I explained the risks to rewards. She decided shoes and a holiday was the better choice.
I already learned my lesson on that front, told a bunch of friends about bitcoin a while back, and the one dude in the room I don't like is the only one that bought some, he also now believes he knows a lot more about it than I do, he's currently looking into Bitcoinnect, one of the many things I warned him to steer clear of.

My following comment is not to suggest that this fork is the same as the BCH fork and would have similar results.
I remember all the doom and gloom leading up to the August 1st Hard fork, people still piled in to try to get coins on both chains if I remember correctly however not as many it seems as Bgold/S2X everyone thought the fork would trigger a bear market but instead the price of BTC boomed. I think all the people dumping their BCash for Bitcoin assisted this.

Bitcoin lost market share to other crypto currencies because... Well because there are other crypto currencies. Most people are buying into alts to try get rich quick. It's only a small part of the bitcoin community that spend their bitcoin (even when fees were considerably lower) and *its a ridiculously smaller* amount of people that spend their alts. High fees will not affect the price, we would have noticed that already, we are currently at a new ATH just this week in case anyone needs reminding, and like the above mentioned, if fees were so urgent half these companies would have already implemented Segwit. We have the option of utilising 4MB blocks **right now** ands it's not being taken advantage of.
To say other altcoins are only gaining traction because bitcoin fees are high is a very belittling stance towards those altcoins that have complete different goals to what bitcoins trying to achieve, take ether as an example, it has never been advertised as a currency, it's a token, it's never been advertised as a store of value, it's a token.
We will have layer 2 in less than a year but people are dying over having cheaper fees for coffee they won't even buy yet.
Also as a side note, half these altcoins that are trying to be digital *cash* have much lower fees mainly because there is no where near as many transactions occuring on those blockchains so they are yet to run into the scaling wall, you know why fees were not a problem 6/7 years ago? Cause hardly anyone was using bitcoin 6/7 years ago.

I have to partially agree with them on this.
A lot of people still don't realise you can *spend* your bitcoin, most people expect the price to 10, 20 or 30X then sell for the same Fiat Bitcoin was created to help avoid.

Not every average Joe, many of them come to places like reddit before buying and are told never to leave bitcoin on Coinbase.
Some keep on mobile wallets, some paper, some of web wallets many crappy Web wallets.
Hey I hope your right, and Its not that I think Hard forks in general are bad but I think it's naive to think this HF will be exactly like the BCH fork.
If I recall correctly, one of the main reasons BCH survived was its EDA, Bitcoin nor B2X will be implementing EDA either.

It's been 10 years, no other crypto will go mainstream for everyday offline payments in the next 18 months, even if LN launched today Bitcoin probably wouldn't even go mainstream for everyday payments in the next 18months.
Also, LN Is a lot less than 18 months away, why people are still spewing this 18month number is beyond me. I suggest people go look at what Rootstock is doing.
Edit: *Hint - 1000 TPS* and that's just one project.

And and most people hearing about it now only care because the price is rising, humans don't generally like change and are usually happy with the way things are, that being said most of the newcomers &amp; media don't care 1 bit about using it as a medium of exchange they only care if its value rises.
I'm not saying that thats a good thing but just saying the world (as a whole) isn't ready just yet bitcoin payments and bitcoin isn't ready to serve the world of its payment needs it sure is already doing a dam good job as digital gold though, that being said I think we are probably about 10 years away from global adoption and *less than 5* years away from mainstream use.

Another reason to own a Hardware wallet, so far splitting forks on the hardware wallets have been fast and easy.
The simple fact that you may or may not receive forked coins shows that letting a 3rd party control your coins isn't the best idea, the precedent is they can make choices about your coins for you.

Which would only be a bad thing, Coinbase already has a monopoly in the market. Bitcoin was created so we could do away with banks, and Coinbase is positioning itself to become a fricken bitcoin *bank*? Could you imagine what would happen to bitcoin if Coinbase were suddenly hacked? I can tell you this all the people fuding over this tether BS and claiming it would be Gox 2.0 have no idea. If **coinbase** were hacked or something catastrophic happens to them right now *That* would be the only thing comparable to Gox, Infact i would argue it would make Gox look like a non event.
All these companies are fighting for bitcoin to be PayPal 2.0 why? Because of greed. All these millionaires are trying to become billionaires.

No problem man, just remember if you have 0.5 bitcoin (500,000 bits) that is worth $5k if the value drops to $1k you still have 0.5 Bitcoin, you only loose money when you sell it.
Another side note, it's important to remember you can *spend* bitcoin. There are tons of merchants that accept it as a direct payment method, some examples are Overstock.com, games from the Steam network or anything on Amazon (with a 15% discount) via purse.io, by the time Bitcoin is $100k there will me a whole lot more so if you want to realise some profits via Fiat to buy a new Sofa or something remember you can buy it with your bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-10 10:21:13
Yes, I believe it's a hoax, but even if it isn't, all the big players have already back out including the largest Miner so it won't gain any traction. We have to remember anyone is free to fork any time. Most altcoins are forks of bitcoin with a new name and logo that project will be no different than any other altcoin if they go ahead with it without support.

A few businesses trying to fork bitcoin. 
Segwit2x came as a compromise to a long standing scaling debate, one side wanted to scale by increasing the blocksize (x2) the other wanted to scale using 2nd layer solutions like Segwit and LN. S2X was proposed to avoid a Hardfork, they Hardforked anyways and created an alt coin on August 1st (BCH/BCash)
There is literally no reason to continue with a second Hardfork considering those that wanted bigger blocks now have them in the form of BCash. 
Further to this, the S2X fork has no replay protection. 
I don't like to dwell on price but I bet my last dollar we would be at $10k without the S2X drama, no one likes uncertainty, even though it looks like the project is fast loosing support.

Not against increasing the cap at some point if appropriate.
Yes against 2X via a NYA decided by a bunch of CEOs who's sole purpose is not to increase blocksize but to gain control over the network.

I agree, sort of, I don't imagine a couple of emails from a few reddit users will cause them to change their mind on such a big move, I suspect it would be different if it came from a big name in the community, I really don't think spamming them with emails will help the situation at all.
On the bright side, we have to remember that there are people outside of reddit and twitter fighting in our corner on this too.
2x will be a shambles, no replay protection = only bad news, it's a loose loose situation, this is why I think 2x will not go ahead at least not in they way they think it will.

Almost all "NO"s
Basically the point of it was because a twitter poll had been done to ask a similar question, vast majority were against the 2X fork but those (few) who are pro2x accused the pole of being faked, this second one was done to force people to comment yes or no so they cannot easily hide behind bot accounts as they were accused of doing and not surprisingly many accounts with long history voted NO.
Edit: can't find link at the moment but there's also a similar poll where must have a Coinbase account in order to vote, results are similar vast majority against the NYA 2X fork.

If you don't plan on moving/spending your coins, you won't have as much to worry about, my advice would be to keep them on either a Ledger or a Trezor.
Just be mindful that any transactions on or after the fork period are at risk of a replay attack untill they are split (or unless replay protection is added)

sounds like it's not been all about the money for you, I could be wrong. I'm sure that extra $5000 isn't going to make a life changing impact on your life right now, at least not anymore than what the other 8 BTC has done, and if it goes to 0 tomorrow you get to say you rode the BTC rollercoaster and left with $35k.
Hold that last one, even if its just for novelty, yeah it could go to 0 tomorrow but you wouldn't have lost out, on the other hand it has just as much chance as seeing $100k or more.

Comes across like you were just looking for a reaction by using politics in your example, I think that's what u/lustigjh meant.
And I don't think the prediction is that farfetched, many people 10-20 years ago could see the direction we were headed in relation to computers and the Internet I can remember having similar discussions with my family back then too and of course it was unimaginable for some, my Aunty was pretty adamant that computers would pretty much be a luxury for the rich &amp; big companies and not used worldwide by the general public.
I promise you I can also remember an old friend pretty much describing YouTube to me back in school, "everyone will have their own personal TV Channels on the Internet in the future"
Let's imagine 20-30 years from now, we live in a world dominated by Blockchain technology (and Bitcoin), the next generation won't be able to imagine life without it in the same way many people under 20 today can't imagine life without the Internet, and all the people being labeled as crazy today for describing such a future will be called out by guys like you who discredit their claims that they always knew we were headed in said direction. 
This isn't to say that OP isn't lying though, just that we should probably give him the benefit of the doubt because many people of 1990 could imagine what 2017 may look like, some were wrong but some had to be right.

Most of everything in that sub is white noise, Core did this, Blockstream did that.

They're determined to take control, this entire move if successful sets a precedent that Bitcoin can be changed at the will of a few people.
Let's say majority mining power is in China or USA or Russia, anywhere really it doesn't matter. A country can force its miners to mine on whatever chain they like, whether it be at a loss or not, the 2MB limit is nothing compared to what they could change, say good bye to what little privacy there is or they could change the coin limit, they could change mining reward they can change anything they like **as long as it's the chain with most accumulated difficulty**.
This is BS, Coinbase is trying to save face by including a peice about "letting the market decide" as well as difficulty but the fact is the market has already decided! Check any futures B2X is trading at a fraction of the price of BTC.

This, before the BCash fork, they were almost all anti Bitcoin (current) and S2X, now BCash is failing a lot are suddenly jumping ship to B2X mainly because it is an operation to displace the current bitcoin Devs.
Im still completely shocked that there hasn't been a backlash over there against Ver, reason being he convinced a lot of beginners to buy BCash and a lot of Holders to sell their Bitcoin and buy Bcash, a lot of people have lost money over there, and I fear that is only going to increase their hate towards BTC, I really hope one day the two communities can come together again, r/Btc proves why leaders are bad for bitcoin.

Yet he continues to try to pump it and use his control over Bitcoin.com (a very important domain name needless to say) to con beginners into buying an altcoin which shows little to no promise of making any traction.
First B2X was evil, then Bitcoin Cash was the real Bitcoin, then B2X was the real bitcoin, now BCH is the real bitcoin again and apparently this firework salesman has discovered that Segwit breaks bitcoin.

I hear what you're saying, but for you and the guy in the parent comment.
Do not panic buy and do not panic sell, you will get burned, buy the dips, dollar cost average on a weekly or monthly basis with a set amount, even if only $40 a month and **hodl on*
Additionally, if you do ever want to sell, remember you can also spend as an alternative, try overstock.com or buy a game from steam using bitcoin or something.
Edit: and buy the dips.

Edit: they made a good point about people outside the bitcoin community not even knowing who he is though, this is the reason we can't ignore the 2x attack, their silence is a red herring, while we're distracted with JPM, China bans etc they're playing possum, there are millions of bitcoin users now millions, most of which are just users and do not know all this drama is going on behind closed doors and will not know there is a coup to try to change coins from legacy to 2x (without replay protection).

@_date: 2017-10-23 17:44:44
[1]Twitter polls, people wearing hats, reddit posts, yeah you're right, this doesn't govern consensus either, thankfully we are able to put our bitcoin where our mouths are and let our coins speak for us, before I can continue on that though I want to ask [2] how can you be fine with miners governing decisions to change bitcoin? What happens when miners are influenced behind closed doors? Maybe China has majority Hashrate and wants to increase the coin cap from 21 million to 50 million, maybe USA has majority Hashrate and thinks it would be wise to change the Miner reward to a fixed 50 coins for the foreseeable future, but I digress.
[1]The markets have clearly shows that the holders favour the **current chain** over the B2X chain, this in my opinion, (and you're free to disagree, I don't speak for r/bitcoin or core or Luke, only myself) is currently a strong way to gauge the support of the users, it also doesn't help that most polls done so far are also *for* the current chain, there was also a poll done which required a Coinbase account to help keep the results from being skewed, this too was in favour of the current chain, but again I do agree that social media polls are not enough, this doesn't however mean that the decision is automatically given to miners alone.


Let's take the time to remember it started at 95%. *Signaling* alone doesn't account for much when we know miners follow the money.

The Segwit section in the Ledger wallet isn't Segwit2X, using the Segwit part of your leger = cheaper transactions however they still allow you the option to send bitcoin without using Segwit which is why they have the legacy option. 
I really think they should change the layout, the option to transact using Segwit should be within the account page, giving Legacy and Segwit as options prior to opening your wallet makes it seem as if you're using two different blockchains or something for new users, evidently. 
Just to clarify, Segwit2X = B2X, literally a completely different coin, them calling Segwit2X just causes more confusion.

It's about setting the precedent, if miners have total say over changing this because hash power apparently = bitcoin, what else do they have power over? Why can't they change coin limit to 21 zillion?  why can't they reset the block reward? Why can't the Chinese government swoop in without us knowing and tell them point to X chain instead and call X chain Bitcoin, or any other government which country has majority mining power. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:22:18
To be fair, I guess there's other things (blockchain?) related they could announce that people that may not know too much about crypto might just group together with bitcoin in their heads.
Let's say for instance Amazon is announcing its own token, someone that doesn't know much about bitcoin may hear this and think *"hey, like that Bitcoin thing? I know a guy that likes bitcoin, I'm sure he will be pleased"*

Show them blockchain.info and then show them links to articles where criminals that use bitcoin and like your friend naively believe they can't be tracked are sent to jail, the idea that Bitcoin is used for terrorism and cannot be tracked is a myth.

If bitcoin was so anonymous, there wouldn't be coins such as Monero or Zcash.

A hardware wallet should be first suggestion, and offer the option of a paper wallet as a secondary option for those more technically inclined. 
If your computer is already compromised, your paper wallet is useless. The idea of paper wallets are alien to most people outside of the community, regardless of how secure they are they are more of a novelty solution by this point.
Buy yourself a hardware wallet OP, they are less than $100 and easy enough for even a child to set up, even if the device is damaged, lost or stolen your bitcoin are safe providing you have the recovery seed stored safely.

Bitcoin today is not the same bitcoin we had just a few short years ago, and bitcoin tomorrow will look nothing like the bitcoin we use today.

To be fair, Bitcoin has and always will be 1 BTC = 1 BTC.
But if Satoshis coins were to move, that could spell game over (but that's unlikely because Satoshi is likely dead and/or the keys are lost)
S2X fork could set a precedent of future forks and corporate take overs (we will find out in November but with this too, chances are that S2X will fail) 
I don't think there is any scenario bitcoin goes to 0 at this point though, not saying its impossible for it to fall to $200 like you mentioned, but we've gone past the point of it completely disappearing.

There won't be a jumping back and forth between ships, signaling doesn't mean they will definitely begin mining the other chain, and if BTC remains a higher value, there shouldn't be any back and forth either.

Segwit did increase the blocksize, [Here are some blocks larger than 1MB]( If I'm not mistaken we can currently produce blocks up to 4mb thanks to Segwit.
And I can still run my node without having to spend $20k like CSW suggests we should. 
And yes, we will scale to billions of users, [with layer 2 and 3 solutions](
The base blocksize will also be increased, safely and once it's needed.

Satoshi is most likely dead and the keys to those bitcoins long lost.
Edit: Satoshi I also invented arguably the best technology we have have seen since the Internet itself, maybe the best invention since ice cream, those coins are his, forking to lock them away would never fly, why? Not because of any of the reasons stated above, but because Bitcoin is not only programmable money, but it is Digital Gold, Bitcoin is an Immutable asset, if Satoshis coins can be forked away so may everyone elses.

Depends on how you look at, keep in mind yeah in the west many people are *investing* into bitcoin with hopes to sell, but the billions on unbaked people around the rest of the globe will use it to transact, there's a reason we now have satellites in space broadcasting the blockchain back down to earth.
So no, not literally everyone in the world but Bitcoin, if successful will be a lot more than just an investment vehicle, and will be host to billions of people.

No, it's okay don't worry about it, that guy above is being an ass.
Segwit was already implemented a few months ago, on the core chain. 
The whole Segwit2X thing isn't "Segwit" at all, its 2X with the Segwit name plastered in front of it.
But besides, the team pushing 2X do not care about the blocksize, as they know we have already increased it, their only mission here is to replace the core development team, they use the whole blocksize thing as a scapegoat, BitPay (a 2X company) already came clean about this.

No problem, no noobish questions, we're all learning.
If you want to understand the fork in November and why so many people are against it on a technical level [watch this]( [Then this](
As for your bitcoin on your Trezor, you don't have to do anything, your coins are safe, I would avoid making any transactions during the period of the November fork for a few days just to play it safe but in general you don't have to do anything, you've already taken the correct steps in securing your bitcoin on a hardware wallet.
As for bitcoin gold (BTG), where do I even start? This fork (in my personal opinion, I speak only for myself) feels very Scammy, most people think the fork already occurred a little while ago and most places I don't think are even supporting it. (read Coinbase statement on the BTG Hardfork.) 
I personally won't be taking the time to try and split BTC and BTG unless either Trezor or Ledger allow for them to be easily split like they did with BCash.
In any event though, even with your bitcoin still on your Trezor you still own coins on both chains.

Yet a few months later the chain split.


Even if you ignore all the fact that most social media polls and general feedback suggest people are firmly against the NYA, the markets alone shows that a large part of the community does not want this, just look at the markets futures, so in my opinion my original point stands; this is not a proposal, they have decided and apparently that means it should go forward.


All this nonsense for what? To prevent a split that already happened? Continuing with this Hardfork does more harm than good.

Lol, if bitcoin reaches $1M or even $500K you won't need to "Cash out"
You'll save yourself a bunch of money on fees by just spending your bitcoin on the same things you would with the Fiat you would cash out too.
In other words if bitcoin is $1M it is acceptable as a standard payment method globally, retail, real estate, taxes etc.

This is why they want gigantic blocks, and morons are just bending over with their pants down begging to take it from behind, because "Muh feez", instead of enabling Segwit and or waiting a few months for LN, and this isn't even the main reason I'm against 2X. 
And the Biz heads like over at Xapo also just taking in the ass, they basically let us know that even if B2X was a fork to say for example double the 21mil coin limit, they would blindly follow it and accept it as the new bitcoin like a bunch of jackasses, "buh buh, Muh agreement".

The BCH fork was different as it had replay protection, meaning that a transaction on the BTC chain does not occur on the BCash chain and vice versa, the B2X fork does not have replay protection, meaning users can end up being victim to replay attacks, having their bitcoin lost or stolen.

It's not about the blocksize, and they themselves have already said this, it's about removing the current development team, again, they themselves said this.
They don't give a shit about the blocksize, (which is what many of us have been saying for months) and it was first proven when Segwit was activated, most of them still refuse to mine blocks over 1mb even though it's been possible to do so for weeks now, then it was clarified by BitPay (a 2x company) that the blocksize is not what S2X is about.

Granted bitcoin continues to increase as it has been, the price per BTC will absolutely dwarf bitcoins highs of today, on chain transactions will still be a thing, even with LN. Miners will likely receive more 20+ years from now than they do today.

And in this case we would be using Bits to describe a unit of value, I don't see how the word bit as in computer bit matters, even with its relation to bitcoin.
As long as it's in context, using the word Bits should cause very little confusion, the fact that we have the word bit for computer bits actually makes me like the idea of using as a unit of value more appealing.
Additionally, I don't imagine most people even have an idea as to what a computer bit is, yeah sure *we do* but mom and pop sure don't.
Whats funny, the actual definition for "bit" is ["a small part of something"]( to me it makes so much sense. 
It rolls off the tongue too, unlike words like Millibitcoin or Microbitcoin, who wants a "Microbitcoin"?, forgive the digression but this also reminds me about the "Satoshi", I love the idea of paying homage to Nakamoto, but the average person couldn't care less unfortunately, I remember when I first tried explaining bitcoin to my family, if you saw their faces when I used the word Satoshi to describe the smallest unit, I felt like a joke lol.
I believe **Bits** and **Sats** will be the future of bitcoin.

The plan wasn't to create a system to generate counter value and cash out at a later date.
The plan was to create a new system, a decentralised one, new money, the chances of Satoshi "cashing out" are negligible, providing he is even still alive.
It still amazes me that people seem to think bitcoin goes to $1M without it being accepted as a global payment method, if bitcoin reaches those numbers you probably won't have anything to "cash out" to, and even if there is, why would you pay fees converting to Fiat just to spend the Fiat on the same things you can spend your BTC.

Sure, paper wallets more secure than hardware wallets, but when someone asks how to best secure their funds, the convenience of a HW wallet trumps the debatable extra security you may get from a paper wallet, reason being most people outside the bitcoin world (let's take your average Joe, or someone's grandparent) are going to look at the idea of a paper wallet as ludicrous and I think are much more likely to struggle and risk loosing funds with one. HW wallets are the easiest and safest (secure) on ramp into storing your bitcoin and should be the first recommendation for anyone new to the space in my opinion, they give clear step by step instructions and are presented in a way that's a lot less convoluted.

Sometimes I'm so sure that some of the people on r/btc are legitimate r/buttcoiners just trolling their sub for fun/spite
I remember when that funny post comparing r/bitcoin and r/Btc was posted on both subs and for ~24 hours it was like the community was one again, even if only a short time, that day it was a whole lot easier to sift through the trolls (on both sides) and filter out those on either side who were actually sympathetic to one another.
I digress a little but this is why I think things like Halving Parties and Bitcoins Pizza day are so important, they take the edge off a little I think.
Edit: another thing that doesn't help the other sub are the blockstream conspiracy theories than only serve to further divide, because when new users join and pick up on this narrative, they no longer even care about Blocksize, 1mb, 2mb, 8mb 300kb it doesn't matter, if it's anything "borgstream" it's evil, I've genuinely seen people (albeit YT comments) claim blockstream is using bitcoin for some sort of illuminati new world order end game, this kind of thing is poison for bitcoin.

I said from the start, if a few companies and miners can fork to change the rules of bitcoin without consensus (No social support, no Node support, no market support) then bitcoin has failed, a lot of people don't realise that this fork would set a precedent that if one country has majority hash rate its nation could strongarm its miners and CEOs into taking bitcoin into an alternative direction, it could happen and us not even know it's being manipulated by a government (not saying B2X is a government attempt but just saying future attempts could be made possible)
This event makes bitcoin strong once it survives after the fork, but this issue really needs to be addressed once it's passed, this isn't the first time a small group of individuals have tried to take over bitcoin.

Well I'm only giving my personal opinion which probably doesn't mean much but last Halving was on or around July 9th '16.
6 months prior to that date the price was hovering between $400 - $450) (keep in mind this is coming from a boring 2 year bear market of the low $200s since the Gox stuff) 
On that date [Halving Day] the price was around $650
6 months later we were at $1000
I would argue those were the biggest price movements since the 2013/15 Mt. Gox silk road  drama, things were pretty dull before the last Halving, and if I remember correct that run up before the Halving was cut short (I believe it came close to $800 before hand) by the Bitfinex hack, I reckon we would have seen $1000 before Halving day if it wasn't for that.
One important difference between now and back then though, investors are taking bitcoin serious now, this wasn't the case during the last Halving, by 2020 we may very likely have Bitcoin ETFs a lot of new money flooding in and a lot less bitcoins in circulation, Coinbase users were also a lot lower back then too, Halving hype will be very much active in the months leading up to it.

I know of at least one major miner being part of that "95%" that has publicly backed out and said they would continue on with the current Bitcoin Blockchain, that same miner last time I checked was still signalling, so the 95% doesn't mean much when we don't know how many miners actually intend on following through, that being said
Signalling doesn't mean much, especially when we already know, miners follow the money, the market is clearly showing a favour to BTC over B2X so we know that the chances are BTC will be valued a lot more, and again miners follow the money.

There's no good or bad time to enter, price can tank any day, price can rise any day, for instance I myself remember advising people I know just before August 1st that it was a terrible time to enter because of the Fork FUD back then, then the price shot up.
I know this fork is much worse than Aug 1st, but we just never know, price could go either direction at any time.
So today is just as good a day as any to buy.

Not likely at this point, it would take a catastrophic event in BTC to cause an altcoin to overtake it, and even then, Bitcoin going down would be bad for crypto overall for a while before another coin is able to gain trust again.
Bitcoin is lucky enough to have the network effect on its side and its commonly labeled as digital gold in the media now (instead of a mysterious ponzi used by drug dealers like they claimed in ~2013) 
Anything is possible though I guess.
