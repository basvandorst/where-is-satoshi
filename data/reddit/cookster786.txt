Pm me for binance account for free. It's a work around to new registrations. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:55:29
Well at least you didn't buy back in the days and obtained 10k BTC for $10. And sold for $20 profit. That would kill me. Lol. It's all good fun. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:05:27
Try lykke. I use them no fees for withdrawal. Hit my account 5 days. 3k spending limit. Better hurry they got a good buy price.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:25:43
i usually move mine to lykke, and then do a bank transfer take 5 days, but what i withdraw is what i receive. im from uk
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:43:53
Hold. Hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:00:31
This is big news!
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:51:48
He's an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:31:25
Take a look at lykke.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:49:57
If he bought at 4k 3 months ago he'd be far far richer. Period.
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:42:02
No expert can predict bitcoin. This is just pure fud. Move along nothing to see here..
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:36:28
This has got to be the most accurate graph I've ever seen.

@_date: 2018-06-29 20:21:08
Unfortunately that is the mentality across the board. When it goes back up again which is inevitable. It will be a rinse repeat scenario for ever because this is human nature.
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:31:17
Gox wallet supposedly
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:58:19
Thanks so glad to hear. Bookmarked.
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:35:58
That's a risk you got to take.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:42:52
It started pumping crazy last Sunday around 6pm UK time
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:09:40
Try lykke. It doesn't cost a penny to transfer. You will however.need to transfer btc first to there
 I would use gdax to buy the btc as it's free with a limit order.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:56:15
Lykke no fees
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:46:14
Im personally transferring my btc on an exchange who will split the coins then I'll move them back to paper
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:58:45
Lykke works for me no fees to withdraw
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:55:00
Following. The b2x dangling carrot has me thinking too
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:43:29
I don't know but it started pumping around 6pm UK time. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:03:54
Sign up with lykke and transfer your btc to lykke and then transfer it to your account for free. You will need to verify your account though which takes about 39 minutes. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:56:16
Better off keeping it on the exchange, they will create the split for you. Then after move it into a wallet like mycelium or breenbits
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:23:36
I would invest at least 35k 100% and withdraw 50%  after the fork. You will earn more interest in BTC.

At least the Americans were up when this happened. Just got to wait for the Australians now
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:24:53
I think we're getting quite resistant to the news now.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:26:53
You.can use lykke or gdax (owned by coinbase) same user ID and password etc. Lykke uncanny download thru app store. Gdax is web based but I prefer it as it gives more details.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:30:35
This is utter rubbish when you collect enough to withdraw you have to sign up to a free iPhone or vouchers and end up in a never ending loop where you have been e to  supply of your personal information. Avoid at all costs! I used an alias name. Lol
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:09:29
I enjoy using lykke
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:46:30
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:07:28
He said it was a joke. What a pathetic loser. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:31:43
You can transfer it to and from for free
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:40:06
If it does then I'll own 5 more coins.
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:24:26
Let's hope it doesn't fall too much tonight. Don't want to wake up in the morning and it's down by 500...I'm a hodler. Maybe I should just forget about it for a couple of years. It is a long term investment
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:19:58
Yes. London

Fuck man that was deep and scary. Poor you. What's wrong with these people? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:03:39
You've only joined Reddit today. Further raising my suspicion.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:58:24
I got the same problem this is due to the block chain problem currently they are experiencing. I'd wait it out they said it can take 24 hours. Send them an email
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:46:32
Oh now they tell us! Why not while there was a dip. Hmmm.
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:28:26
People should read the posts before making a post on the same news we heard 10 hours ago
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:00:31
Ive been waiting 16 hours still nothing not even showing as pending 
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:47:49
Looks like we're last that!
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:48:20
When it feels like having a shit!
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:17:31
I've not sold anything yet. But am sure it's perfectly fine. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:32:51
Yes but you need to withdraw it from the coinbase wallet in gdax it's free
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:32:30
I thought it was more of a price correction
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:04:16
You have to go through there website 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:12:02
Followed by if the news is true, my tweet just made the market crashed sooner instead. If it's not true, then the market will recover stronger
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:49:47
It's been plastered all over the media since this morning. Hence the price of bitcoin dropping $300 in value.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:13:15
They just sharing the spoils.

@_date: 2017-09-19 14:02:41
Ok show me proof then. Idiot!
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:59:32
What utter rubbish. Do not fall for this scam. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:31:38
Use gdax it's owned by coinbase and better rates. I would personally move it to lykke. They don't charge a penny to withdraw.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:26:53
You.can use lykke or gdax (owned by coinbase) same user ID and password etc. Lykke uncanny download thru app store. Gdax is web based but I prefer it as it gives more details.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:42:14
How can I then claim them? Is there another way 
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:36:17
Lykke is also good. No fees. I use them.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:31:43
You can transfer it to and from for free
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:54:18
Tell her you sold at 3800 and actually.sell higher and give her the money at 3800 and then give her the extra u made and ask her if she wants to split it perhaps ?
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:36:22
Unfortunately not. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:01:28
Use lykke you get a better rate and you can send it to a UK bank.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:31:49
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:11:23
You need to go into your banks branch with all the proof and show it to them that it was a genuine transaction. Get in touch with the fraud team and don't be shy to contact the police as this is fraud and taken very seriously by the police. Good luck you will get your money back.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:10:43
Funniest thing I've seen today. This is becoming a daily thing.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:14:58
Probably zoncoin there own.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:32:51
Yes but you need to withdraw it from the coinbase wallet in gdax it's free
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:32:56
All that worrying for no reason. Human nature I guess!
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:16:47
I would.jist hodl. Not worth risking it for a couple of hundred or even thousand.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:51:56
Just received email from coinbase confirming bitcoin has been sent after sending them an email
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:18:08
Yesterday at transaction took hours. The reason being there is alot of stress on the chain because trading is at its highest due to the forthcoming fork
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:37:09
This post is a waste. Move along
@_date: 2018-07-12 08:00:17
WEX will take your BTC and not allow you to withdraw or transfer it. They are gtox in disguise. Google it
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:35:54
Cos that's my fun day
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:05:44
I would put it in a wallet such as bread wallet or greenbits. And once the fork is over I would move it to an exchange that supports the fork like bittrex.
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:59:33
Phone app only
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:42:31
It's just a correction and the whales showing some muscle
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:18:07
Thanks it's beautiful!
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:12:31
I use greenbits because they will support the fork. I also heard bread wallet does too. I'm not sure about the one you mentioned worth doing your research. Also make sure you set up Google authentication.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:10:17
Done 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:35:32
I would recommend lykke no fees for buying or withdrawing. The rate can sometimes be a little higher. You just need to wait until someone sells it lower.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:22:24
Never too late to buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:34:43
We need everyone in for it to moon!
