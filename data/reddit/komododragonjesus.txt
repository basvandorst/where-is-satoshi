That's a pretty good guide and includes links for downloads. It's for BTC, none of this BCH garbage.
 has instructions to set up a testnet lightning node.
 is another implementation of lightning nodes. I think you can set this one up on testnet or mainnet (I've never used it though).

You might have better luck getting an answer in or whichever one you use.

If making a single bulk payment is an option then that might be the better way to go. There exist many services that you can't pre-pay for months or years in advance and in any of those scenarios lightning will be a better option.
Another possible improvement is that lightning is a network which will include many businesses. So for example you could lock 10 mBTC in a channel, use 4 for TorGuard and use the remaining for other services if there is a route to them available.

Giving it a try. When setting up a Lightning channel you only need 2 confirmations to send payments but you need 6 to receive. This seems like an oversight.
Also is it possible to open more than one Lightning channel?

Mining difficulty is based on total hash power. If mining becomes breakeven then some miners will stop, the difficulty will drop and mining will become profitable for the remaining miners.

I have a possibly dumb question about the protocol I guess if you have a moment. 
Alice opens a channel with Bob. Alice can send to Bob after 2 confirmations. But Bob can't create a request until there are 6 confirmations, therefore Alice can't actually send anything until 6 confirmations. How is it possible to transact after only 2 confirmations (which I've done on both your wallet and on Eclair) if this is the case?

It has happened several times already

Yes they can. 1 bit is 100 satoshis. Satoshis are the indivisible one.

You know this is a Bitcoin sub, right? Bit has different meanings depending on context.
@_date: 2018-10-25 02:40:43
Because it's a scam. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:51:02
So you can either buy 60k worth of bitcoin or you can pay someone across the internet to maybe give you maybe 60k worth of bitcoin over the next 6 months?
Think about it. If you had mining equipment that could mine &gt;60k worth of bitcoin why would you sell it to someone for 60k? You wouldn't.
Also, if you expect bitcoin to go up in value any bitcoin you buy yourself will also go up in value so that argument doesn't really fly.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:36:03
Nobody is paying $80 unless they made some sort of big mistake with their transaction. Anyone who tells you fees are this high is lying to you.

When backlog is low and fees are low people sing from the rooftops about how great it is.

Hey so I've managed to make some progress. It happens anytime I reboot, regardless of OS. What seems to happen is that bitcoind forgets all its settings and reverts to defaults after the reboot.
I was just starting it with _bitcoind -printtoconsole_ which then went to the default directory where there are not proper chainstate files. I should have caught that. It would usually take me a few tries to get it back running even using _-reindex_ and I probably ended up using some combination of that and _-datadir_. I'm new to this, but that's a lesson learned!
Starting it using _bitcoind -datadir=/newlocation/_ works. If I happen to stop the process and restart it (without rebooting in between) it remembers all my settings.
So is there a way to save my desired settings even through a reboot?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:03:32
It will likely never be confirmed and eventually returned to your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:04:59
High of 9240 on QuadrigaCX!

Will do. Reindexing takes a while so I won't have an update on that for a while. Both the one on Ubuntu and the one I used to run on Windows are 0.15.0.1.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:39:50
Thanks for all your help! I'll post some more if / when I make some progress or hit a wall.

~/.bitcoin/blocks is in the same (new) directory as chainstate. I'm not running any other Bitcoin related software on Linux.
I used to run a node on my Windows side but don't anymore since I don't use that OS as much. The files for that were in a different directory and bitcoinQT has been uninstalled so I don't think they should interfere.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:53:35
Do you mean Bittrex? Bitfinex is shown holding only 8.6 million.

Ideally, maybe 20 forks from now people will stop giving shitty forks value. 
Right now they're pretty disgusting. Bitcoin Gold, which doesn't even have a working network is trading at ~0.02 BTC. That's a market cap of 2.3 fucking billion fucking dollars. What. The. Fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:41:35
You purposely set a super low fee hoping it would confirm in 24 hours and now are surprised it isn't done in 12? Be patient. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:21:49
Yes that disk is accessible and used with Windows as well. I don't even think I would know where to begin trying to see if something in Windows interferes with this. To my knowledge, nothing else (linux or windows) uses that specific folder.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:04:53
Understood, thanks!

I've had to open a support ticket with them in the past. I believe they took over 30 days to respond and their response was "is this still an issue?".
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:14:34
Their hash power formula makes no sense. They only refer to difficulty and not hash power itself. Difficulty on bitcoin, and b2x as well doesn't retarget until about a week after the fork (likely slower due to hashrate split) so after 96 hours their formula will always equal 50% no matter which coin is winning.

Crashing every node on the network for 10k seems like a pretty good deal.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:14:21
I had to change the data directory since the drive where ~/.bitcoind is located doesn't have enough space. Its current location has ~500gb free so space shouldn't be an issue. How would I check to see if there are any issues with permissions?

Just the installation instructions on LND’s and Zap’s githubs. Overall it’s pretty simple. I ran into a few snags but just asked questions on the appropriate Slack channels and people way smarter than me helped me out.

Something is not right here. You sent 7 separate transactions to this address over a period of 3 hours, all by accident?
If you sent them, where did you get the address? You must have copied it from somewhere. If you copied it from somewhere that means you know who the address belongs to.
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:41:32
Both. Right now segwit transactions make up less than 3% of total transactions so it's basically all non-segwit.

1) You can't mine Bitcoin with video cards anymore, you would literally just be burning electricity and wearing your hardware.
2) Mining with a video card has no effect on gaming.

Bitcoin.com have stated they will only support 2x and treat it as BTC. Keeping your coins there will likely result in you losing all your BTC.

Maybe they're just really lucky then. I've been watching the hashrate percentages on coin.dance on and off for the past couple months and slush has always been around 5-6% of total hashrate. Today's number is 11%.
Could also mean that someone else turned off machines so their percentage share went up that way.
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:03:10
looks like it 
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:02:57
They can't get 90% anyways. F2Pool has publicly  backed out and they represent 10% of hashing power.
