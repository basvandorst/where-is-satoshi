guys i'm pretty new to this, so please, can somebody answer my question: i bought a small amount of btc, and the received amount is visible under the "history" tab in my electrum wallet, but no confirmations yet, so it says "unconfirmed". my question is: can i sell this same amount of unconfirmed btc or do i have to wait for full confirmation before i can sell it again? p.s.: i think it's going up again, are we SAFE ? ;) ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:52:43
thank you for your answer! no no, i'm not selling, i'm a hodler fa sho! this was just a technical oriented question to understand the system a lil bit better.

in fact, cars already are priced in bitcoin: 
and in the not so distant future nearly everything will be priced in btc which makes changing back to fiat obsolete.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:15:51
excuse me please, but... what IS a fodler?
@_date: 2018-05-29 22:33:00
well, not necessarily... i hope my future-lambo-car dealer will accept bitcoin. cause then there's not really a reason to change back to fiat. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:00:58
no i don't. i just hope that 1 btc will be worth 1 lambo. where is fiat in my calculation?
@_date: 2018-05-21 05:27:01
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:28:28

@_date: 2018-05-31 17:05:11
in theory, would it be possible to send btc to the wallet i'm sending from? could i send btc to myself?
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:38:37
damn, how do you know that?!
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:00:21
ah come on, don't you remember that crazy feeling, this rush of adrenaline through your veins everytime the price went up? just a little more time and.... your addiction will be satisfied again.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:51:08

i made 2 sheets of paper with a looooong random (nonsense) text on it. then i put my 24 keywords between the text. for example the 11. word, the 22. word., the 33. word, the 44. word, the 55 ... and so on. this is just an example, be creative to create your own "code"! then i have a number. this number is IN MY HEAD ONLY. i feel pretty safe with this.  i keep one of the papers and also gave a copy of the text to one of my family members in case my house burns down (they dont know the "secret number"!). you just cant trust anybody in this case.... p.s.: an old office typewriter might be handy for this job. and triple check your creation before finally burning these 24 words on the very first paper for good ;)
@_date: 2018-06-18 10:23:03
get yourself an e-cigarette, start vaping with a pretty high nicotine dosage (16 - 32 mg nicotine), it's really much better than smoking and also can save you a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:05:17

@_date: 2018-06-23 00:33:06
who's buying at these levels? who's selling at these levels? lol
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:47:00
unbelievable. just un-fucking-believable.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:46:49

you will always have to take care of your private key which is 12 words for electrum and 24 words for the ledger nano s. there's no way around it.
@_date: 2018-06-15 07:10:35
i wasn't sure about the origin of the random words and finally did not use the bipxxx wordlist. just some random words from a textgenerator, i took this one:  after all, if somebody stole my text he would need some good amount of time to crack the code, enough time for me to transfer my funds.
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:29:42
ledger nano s (hardware, most safe) or electrum (desktop app, pretty safe).
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:45:25

bitcointicker.co doesnt seem to work properly for bitstamp chart.... what's going on..?!?!
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:27:42
yeah, right now you get 10 bits for 8 cents! not one! TEN!

i'm dealing with btcdirect  (netherlands) and never had a problem. a nice wallet to use is electrum.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:31:13
more like 0.5%
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:09:10
i bought yesterday, bought today and will buy at 6.5k.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:14:22
don't forget, one bitcoin is a huge amount, theres only 21 million! the average guy won't be able to buy 1 bitcoin in the not so distant future. he will buy some bits (1/1000000 btc).  right now, you get 10 bits for 8 cent. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:27:19
it looks "healthy" to me. we surely can say that we keep it around 1100.
it's all...... good.

you mean it's stabilizing?

how about a smart roadster? im selling mine for 0.8 btc. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:28:14
it might go sideways for some more weeks, it might even drop for some more weeks but the coin will rule again, sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:54:43
go to binance. fees are VERY low (0.05%). and then take a look at centra coin (ctr) ;)
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:39:51
perhaps behind every bot is not a human but an ai?
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:46:44
i think you're not QUITE there... a little more torture is needed to get you to the state of capitulation. lol

@_date: 2018-02-02 18:13:34
same happened to me. sold at 8.2k, and already regret it. i just feel like half of a man without my btc. but now theres no way back. will buy again at 7k and below.
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:59:41
it's a good time to start now cause altcoins are back. it works good if you can control your feelings. start with some bucks and get a feeling for it. diversify! then let it run for 12 or 24 hours, don't come back to the charts too often else you'll get mad. don't get out of a coin too early, sometimes you also have to ride the dip...
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:15:36
thank you, i'm still hodling my 0.5 btc and your writing is what i needed now.

1 WZC = 100 million Woshotis. That's for sure.

it would even out, in the end the busines will make profit.
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:20:12
0.05 would be huge i think.

did it died again?
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:42:43

...which doesn't make my first statement wrong. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:06:01
it strangely looks like somebody tries to keep the price at or above 7000. ps: i dont know anything.
