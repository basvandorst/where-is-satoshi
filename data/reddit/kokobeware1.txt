Well it sucks, but hey, their loss is our gain. That's people without a lot of money they can't buy more btc with.

Everyone with BTC in Mt gox, I am so sorry for you guys.

Your absolutely right. People are going to think it's unstable and too risky of an investment. But I think longterm. I'm excited for what bit coin offers. And since it isn't illegal yet, that's a huge plus too.

I think what's he is trying to say is that it's a convenience thing. Aka fuck banks, fuck mortgage companies and let's pay in BTC

LSMFT? Schizo for sure

I agree with you here. I posted how sorry I was to people who lost thousands of coins and I got an inbox full of " why are you so sorry?! It was a risk they take" comments

Maybe I'm missing something- how is me donating my BTC going to save him? He did what he did.

Ummmm anybody else notice the classy can of dog bite???

No your right. But I feel bad for the people who lost large sums due to stupidity. I'm even sorry you lost some btc. I'm new to this and I only buy from coin base and shit like that. But I just bought some more at 480 a pop

I highly doubt the cop said something along the lines of "wow! That's the guy that started bitcoin?!" I feel it went more like " that guy started what?"
