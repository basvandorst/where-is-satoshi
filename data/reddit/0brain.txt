The last message from Satoshi on the forum was on 10 Dec 2010, which was 9 days before the handover to Gavin was announced. In April 2011, Gavin announces he will give the conference talk in June. In a later podcast he says he didn't hear from Satoshi for "a couple of months" and the last contact attempt was when he emailed Satoshi to tell him about the talk (so Satoshi did not reply). ~~This suggests to me that Satoshi disappeared in December 2010 and did not have anything to do with the talk. Satoshi basically never saw the email.~~;
Edit: According to Gavin's forum posts, Satoshi [was](
)  [busy]( in January 2011, which is why he was absent from the forums and development. But Gavin was allegedly in email contact with Satoshi in [March]( and [April]( 2011. So this theory might be plausible after all.

So there is this juicy quote from the first Gizmodo piece:


(Patrick Paige was Kleiman's business partner)
Why did Wright change his story, first saying Kleiman was the inventor, then later relegating him to one of a "group of people"?
Also, if you want to completely disregard the evidence from the "hacked" Wright files, there is some circumstantial evidence:
1. Kleiman was [active on the Metzdowd mailing list]( since at least 2004, the list where Satoshi made the first Bitcoin announcement in 2008.
2. Kleiman was hospitalized in late 2010, where he would remain until April 2013. Gavin Andresen [became Bitcoin maintainer]( in December 2010. And then Satoshi disappeared.
3. The time zone [checks out]( According to Stefan Thomas, if Satoshi followed normal waking hours, it would put him in the UTC−05:00 or UTC−06:00 time offset. Kleiman lived in Florida.
It makes me wonder whether it was Kleiman who actually enlisted Wright to assist with Bitcoin and not the other way around as Wright told Paige in 2015. This theory fits with the pattern of [PGP key]( [blog post and other falsifications]( and [plagiarism]( that Wright has been engaged in. In fact you don't need Wright to explain how Kleiman may have been Satoshi all on his own.

The [announcement]( stated he had "Satoshi's blessing".

Tweet from Rory Cellan-Jones, who interviewed Wright for the BBC, that mentions Finney and Kleiman by name:


It looks like the BBC cut them out of the video interview.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:02:32
Yeah that is plausible. With Kleiman dead in 2013, nobody would be able to challenge Wright's "hacked" but possibly falsified email records to and from Kleiman.

In 2014, Nguyen held 7.7% of the shares in Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence. Possibly a Wright employee or associate.

Let me help you with that: 
Wow! Kleiman's father posts this comment in **February 2014**, which is well before the December 2015 Wired &amp; Gizmodo articles. I would be interested in learning more about what Kleiman's father thinks about all this.

 I don't find the *extortion theory* to be plausible one.
What leverage does the hacker/extortionist still have? Presumably, the blackmailer discovered Satoshi Nakomoto was a moniker for *at least* two individuals: Kleiman and Wright. But their identities have been leaked to Wired and Gizmodo in 2015, along with incriminating documents about Wright's finances. So if it is just more documents, then how bad can it really be?
Also it seems really crazy to deal with extortion by setting up a circus show in the media. Not to mention permanently damaging his reputation.
Finally, if he wanted the outcome where everyone would call BS, then why did he successfully prove to Jon and Gavin that he was Satoshi?
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:05:43
Yes it is extremely suspicious Wright has not mentioned Kleiman by name. Despite the Wired/Gizmodo stories.
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:08:20


That's not how it happened. Kleiman and Wright wrote a computer forensics paper together in 2008. So they knew each other some how. Also, Wright continued collaborating with Kleiman on computer security work. For example Kleiman's 2011 book *The Official CHFI Exam 312-49: For Computer Hacking Forensics Investigators* lists Craig Wright on the cover as a contributor.
Also, it was Kleiman not Wright who was [active on the Metzdowd mailing list]( since 2004, the list where Satoshi made the first Bitcoin announcement in 2008.

The author of the posts was not in fear of Prometheus:


I think there is also a hint at what these tsunamis were:


So Prometheus fought the extortionist and lost.
At least, that is what this person wants us to believe. That CSW or someone in the group really was hacked in 2015. And that the documents from the hack were authentic and not deliberately faked/leaked. And that this story is legit.

His name is spelled *Dave Kleiman*. In case anyone wanted to hit up google with it.

All of this drama might just be a trap for the real Satoshi(s).

That part was really funny. I totally didn't expect him to say that.
But you're right. If the only reason he is coming forward now is because his identity was leaked in late 2015, then why was giving hints back in July 2014?
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:45:18
That's what I suspect as well. But I think Kleiman may have held most of the wallets, which is why Wright can't really prove anything.
Interesting that Kleiman passed away on April 16 2013. Less than a week before, Bitcoin hit an all-time *record high* of $266 on April 11 only to crash by more than 70%. By April 16th, the price was around $75.
This was probably his YouTube channel:
He sounds like a smart cookie.

This is the first article I have found that suggests Kleiman (who died in 2013) may have been Satoshi:


Patrick Paige was one of Kleiman's business partners. Wright contacted him after Kleiman's death asking if he left any drives lying around. Full story below.

It is unfortunate no mainstream news source has picked up or mentioned these allegations of plagiarism.
The ironic thing is that in 2011 he wrote an article attacking computer security plagiarism!!

Slam dunk

I'm not so sure about CW not having strong views. I just watched a [recently released 3-part series of interviews]( with him from July 2014, and he comes off as quite opinionated on topics relating to currency and also privacy. In fact he sounded downright Rothbardian at times. Having said that, this interview was from 2014 and not from the 2008-2010 Satoshi days, so he could just have been *putting it on*.
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:27:36
Because he's acting like a scammer. And we can't let scammers off the hook to go and give Bitcoin a bad name.
edit: I misread the top comment or maybe it changed in the interim. My answer was about the question of why we can't just leave Wright alone.
@_date: 2016-05-06 14:19:29
That's an interesting angle. But it still doesn't make perfect sense to me.
Because the sportsman in this case was outed by the media as having an affair. Even if the sportsman didn't admit it, the blackmailer had nothing left to blackmail him with.
So the only motivation for the sportsman to admit the affair is to limit the damage to his reputation by owning up to his actions.
But in this case it didn't happen. It's like he made an apology for his actions without admitting he had an affair! Or that he admitted the affair without making an apology for his actions.
That did not improve his reputation at all because it looks insincere.

He comes across as a typical troll.
In two [separate]( [instances]( he baited his debate opponent into a challenge to prove his claims, and then somehow got off the hook. I have seen this pattern elsewhere.

It is disturbing to think that he might be right sometimes. On the other hand, his explanations are often incoherent and unconvincing. Like he is restating someone else's ideas, just not very well.

Does this seem a little too far-fetched in 2016?
