You had me support my arguments, but you do nothing of the sort in return. I'm not sure any of your supposition means what you think it means. To be honest, I would suspect you to be more of a conspiracy theorist than anything.
To begin with, I'm not a victim. I don't have any coin with any exchange. I've lost nothing, and have absolutely no worthwhile investment into the situation other than interest in its proceedings.
Now, I did my best to be inclusive of simply the sector that is involved here. However, if for some reason you misunderstood thats alright. I'd be happy to resolve the contradictions you apparently observed, if you were to see fit to actually argue a point. For now, lets just go with the idea that you're right, I'm contradicting. With that in mind, lets expand the scope.
1. In retail, the most common form of theft is employee theft. 
2. In violent situations, most frequently it is someone close and/or known to you.
3. Home burglary most frequently involves individuals close to you.
4. Infidelity, most frequently involves a friend.
Do I need to go on?
What exactly are you looking for me to provide here, some sort of smoking gun? Honestly I don't need to prove something to you that you've defended with the preconceived notion defense. I'm perfectly happy and willing to budge - I even gave plenty of reasons for a hacker theory. The burden of proof just simply doesn't weigh the scales in that direction. Why do you hold so tightly onto that possibility though? Hell, if we want to, we could even just simply say it was a hack based upon the modern interpretations of what hacking is.
Regardless, I'm not entirely sure what trick it is you're trying to refer to. Psychologically speaking, theft is associated more frequently with the desire to cover up and avoid being observed. Thieves are greedy and naturally tend to be extremely guarded of their "earnings," while also having an appetite for earning more that does not fill. This would be the entire basis of the "honor amongst thieves" irony - thieves think for themselves, even while most criminals themselves have some measure of code of honor.
Hackers on the other hand typically are curious, and are largely community driven. The thirst for knowledge, the belief in implicit freedom, and most importantly the belief in the movement. Look at the pattern of online theft. Online theft is most associated with identity theft - not financial theft. Sony, Target, Home Depot, JP Morgan, HSBC, Visa, MasterCard - these were all information thefts. They were not financial thefts. Though the information can be used towards a financial end, they are always information first - and you never see information pertaining to a direct financial result following those breaches. What you do see, is credit taking afterwords - advertising that "our group did this, look at us for the awesome we are." They are very public, they are very loud, and very in your face. Beyond that, they attack directly by driving sites offline, defacing, or by coordinated efforts to prove a point.
Everything I see, points to someone who is afraid, weighted down by their own guilt. Not someone trying to prove a point.
Finally, I'll go back to the technology side, back to where I mentioned something rather important: stealing bitcoin is difficult. If you employ even just a portion of modern best practices, it makes stealing such a large quantity of coins rather difficult to do without prior knowledge. Perhaps it wasn't him directly but a developer somewhere in the company, or any other individual with access to enough sensitive information. Perhaps its a family member or a close friend to an insider. The point is, I have a card time associating a motivation with the crime for anyone but an insider. Employees develop resentment and feel entitled to more. What exactly did bitfinex do recently to get on the bad side of a hacker?

Ok, sure.
So, lets consider things for a moment. Bitcoin, whether anyone wants to admit it or not, is itself a target - there are a lot of inexperienced and experienced people throwing around a lot of money on a conceptual topic - not a well defined, controlled, enhanced method of finance.
This creates an aspect of diversity. On one hand, since it is a technology, you will have some very smart, very capable individuals at the forefront of the services built around it. This is due to the requirements of using the core service provided - unless you are capable, it's like hashing with an abacus. 
On the other hand, you have very intelligent, very capable **financial** participants. These are people who are knowledgable of the ways of working with, and in, securities and moneys. They may be accountants, they may be securities experts, or they could simply be financial enthusiasts. Whatever the case, these are the "visionaries" that want to get in on a subject that is obviously a forward thinking, future player in the global economy. They want to make sure they are there from the beginning, so as to not miss out on any measure of the returns.
These people have some qualities in common. For one, they are excellent social engineers. They have to be. They both have to sell concepts, ideas, inventions, and plans to people who are mostly ignorant... but more importantly, are naive and completely lost... when it comes to the overarching complexities that make up the complex world of technology driven finance. In addition, they have to convey a certain degree of positive belief to something that has nearly no real basis in fact or proven track record.
Now, lets look at the technology: stealing bitcoin is hard. Period. Its traceable, and the only way to do it other than the theoretical/partially proven extreme concepts is through theft of information. This means that there is really only a few ways that someone will really be able to steal that money:
1. Having the information already
2. Insecure website
3. Social Engineering/Information Theft of the person(s) with 
If we look at the underlying aspects of these options, two of them have clear disadvantages over the other.  and  have additional lakers of evidence and pose the clear risk of exposing the thief through the extremely common methods of known theft mechanisms. In this respect, one can reflect upon past company disclosures with identity theft: the perps were caught, almost always due to the reality of their method. Getting the information almost always requires exploiting a known technique, and therefore is easily observed and discovered.
Why is this important?
When you steal millions of dollars from an investment platform, you are engaging a measure of investigation that **has** the *resources*, *means*, and *desire* to find you. The more pattern driven, or conceptually simple, your tracks are - the more likely you are to get caught.
And someone who considers the theft of bitcoin, and does so as a **hacker** is one who I would expect to be at least of moderate **hacker** intelligence. And such a measure would immediately raise a red flag to them, that this is a stupid idea and I can probably make money better by doing so against those who have more to lose by searching for me.
With all of that aside, there is the secondary notion behind all of this. Financial theft is  generally speaking something I would regard as a lesser-intelligence theft. The reason being, is money - no matter its form - is a very bright guilt beacon. People do not become instantly rich without it being at least moderately obvious. You have a lot of money, you want to spend it. You were **already** greedy, signified by the fact that you **__stole money__** and a very large amount of it. Greedy people have a problem: if you give a greedy person the key to the safe, eventually their greed gets the better of them and they use that key.
Finally, what was there to gain by this? Hackers commonly serve a personal cause when committing a public hack. This is why the common idea of a hack is defacement, doxxing, or other form of public shaming. These methods serve to further a cause - to generate public attention to themselves, and to demonstrate the weakness and incapability of their targets.
This event has NONE of those qualities. Sure, there is a common belief that the general bitcoin exchange is essentially a lie - the security and platform is almost always a pile of shit. History obviously has credit for this insinuation, every exchange that has fallen from Mt.Gox forward (and backwards) has been obviously contender for worst code ever. But these examples all have with them the obvious additional fact: every time it was an inside job. Hackers don't need to do it: the same idiots who wrote the code run the business, so they'll eventually do it to themselves.
So, unless we suddenly see someone pop up with irrefutable evidence that a hacker did this, then my money is on the trend.

Simplest answer is almost always the correct one. Who has an easier time in the theft? The guy with the keys, or the complicated task of breaking in? How many times does an inside job have to happen before it's the probable answer?

Is the project actually complete, or is this just a POC and a demonstration of code already written, looking for more help?
All I can find in the github repo is the code for the arduino. So, questions:
* How do you maintain its wallet?
* How is it connected?
* What security do you use for the aforementioned questions?
* How is the currency stored and accessed?
* What is stored on the device, what is external?
* Is this strictly a individual unit at all times, or has thought been put towards multiple deployments?

I agree. This is crap. There is no information in any of the articles about the situation. It's the most ambiguous bullshit. And I especially believe that they need to provide some kind of proof to what they are saying. The ambiguity makes it sound as fishy as a CIA cover up. It's terrible. 
From the various posts and discussions I've read over the last week-two weeks it seemed like they had found a ton of wallets from the insolvency proof that Gox did back in 2011. Those wallets had not had a single coin removed... well, most of them hadn't. I'll see if I can find that post again.
The questions though... these are where my mind has been:
How do you lose coins for years while people were withdrawing coins throughout that time period (with exception to you know, the lockdown periods)? 
How were those withdrawals going through?
If they lost that many coins, why are they so calm about it?
How is he still CEO?
And whats up with the subpoena?
Is the bankruptcy a ploy to get out of reparations?
The part that pisses me off the most, is the media is going to eat up everything they say... and all of these lies, all of these deceptions, and the complete lack of responsibility. These are going to be the things that end up becoming stories for the next month. I hope it ends up being just fox news or something, so its harm is kept at bay. Oh well.

I use two AmEx for bitcoin transactions. Have been doing so for a long time. They're the only card I use actually. One of those cards has quite literally ONLY bitcoin related transactions. 100% of them.
If the fear is that AmEx is looking to pull a BoA/Chase mass account ban, I don't think so. AmEx has been a relatively progressive and young company even with being the oldest card company (diners card!). Their major business is not credit, its charge cards. They retain a different model. It's that in-between from debit and credit, you have a charge limit but it doesn't carry over, you must pay it at the end of term. It's delayed cash almost.
I spent a lot of time looking into this when I was starting my bitcoin involvements. I was always skeptical that the banks would support it, at least until it became an impact to their base of profit. One thing I researched was the prevalence of dictatorial policy changes in light of changing customer habits. AmEx more often than not produced policies that complimented those habits (the Blue moniker for example), while I've yet to find a bank or credit company that didn't fight it like trying to ban smoking.

By influence and control, I mean on the constituent behavior and not in the futures of bitcoin itself. 
I think something that needs to be remembered is this is not a purchase of bitcoin, this is adoption of developers. While history might warrant suspicious intent on the hiring of devs by a sponsoring parent, I see this as a slightly different situation as it is MIT and not a completely intent-driven software firm. While they are subject to influential direction, they are still susceptible to the nature of the code and it's maintenance requirements.
While there are still questionable motives of any individual, I think at the very least a little personal... Structure may do some of the individual's good.
And yes, I cannot disagree that Bitcoin has it's wealth... But, while the goal and nature of the coin may be in a neutral objective, I don't think we can say all of the money behind it is with such noble intent on its own.
In other words... We need all the help we can get, and money isn't the only problem... Better MIT than some of the other options.

This is how I've viewed the foundation from the beginning. It's easy to bolster a foundation on something that is idealistic, but the second it becomes a force it adds corruptive power to the collected medium. Something that sort of set me astray early was the mixture of a concept that itself is identifiably associated to the common practices that I felt many of these ... movements, forces, changes, attempts, whatever - engender.
Suits in a room only decide what suits in a room do.

Ok wow. I had to do a few extra takes when I saw this.
This is still a thing? The whole forum upgrade... donation... etc etc, this has been going on for *years* and we are still on a failure prone item rather than what was planned.
I would try and pull some of the old links out but I am really not even sure I have them anymore. There was a collection of posts on the forums that reached the majority of points you did, and more. You aren't being blunt and you aren't smelling anything anyone else has not already smelled. I may have my timeline wrong, but I am reasonably positive that we are at least past the two year mark - and thats just on the last time I participated in a forum thread regarding the situation - not a mark for a prior event/headline. I just stopped following it back then - I'm still a little derailed from your post popping up lol.

I see a lot of advice here... I had considered going through all of it to see if I as just going to duplicate effort but I'm gong to do it anyways.
In any profession where there are higher risks of probable confrontation (and worse), we all develop defense systems both as a natural effect of our subconscious wanting to protect ourselves, but also out of the eventual effect of trying to get ahead of that danger to begin with. Those sort of active guards, are not necessarily erased because you change from a paper medium to a digital one.
What I mean by this - well I'll give the most obvious example. If you can help it, you're not going to carry around every dime you earned so that at the end of the night the first brave guy suddenly figures out he can profit off the work you just did. Even if it happens once, thats easily enough times to realize that a loss of $100 is better than a loss of $1000 at the end of the day.
The same stands true here - except you have a little bit of an easier freedom in dealing with it. There are a number of methods that allow you to control how your coins are spread, how you are paid (and where it goes), and ultimately where it is stored. One of the bigger advantages to btc will be the ability to do this without having to cover a distance in order to physically stash it somewhere.
As with any system, you do not want it to be complicated so that you can't even operate it - but you also want it to be sufficiently difficult to present how much you have, and even more difficult to take from it without your express permission. Unlike a Bank, or a physical box, or anything else - bitcoin presents an advantage in giving you control of how many locations it is stored, and, the methods for accessing that store.
My advice, is rather than take advice directly, learn what it is. Learn what it is, and how to use it. Do some practice runs. Buy something online, familiarize yourself with what a wallet is and what it means to use, measure, store, and manipulate your wallet. Once you have that in hand, examine some of the many methods we use to protect our valuable currency - from the most extreme offline storage, to the rather obviously less secure but easier to use method.
With that though... I'd be more comfortable with some advantages/disadvantages. Otherwise, it'll probably come off too complicated scary. It isn't - so given that you are new, I feel its probably better to at least give you a compelling reason to at least give it a shot.
1. You are in control.
2. It's absolute. There is no need to question the value of what you received, and you do not need to question its reception. You have a full view into the transaction.
3. For the other areas within the industry, it is proving quite a valuable asset - and you can see that here on reddit's own trading/markets.
1. You don't necessarily have access right away - so there will be some adjustment to the gained value at the instant.
2. This one is probably the most important. Depending on your locale, how you transfer the coin into usable money, can implicate you in Taxes. What I mean is, when you transition from BTC to Fiat currency, it typically goes through your (or someones') bank. I apologize for making an assumption, but, if you do not establish an income and therefore do not pay taxes... this conversion could result in you getting hit for that - and worse, investigated for past issues as well.
3. Definitely a learning curve, and, possibly a capability curve as well. What I mean is, if you do not have a device capable, a suitable location to store/save something you would prefer to be less available than it already is, and do not have the knowledge - then these are all going to require quite a bit of time and effort to do. It is not hard per say, but it will definitely consume time - so I suppose this is just a warning to be prepared for some effort in attaining the required knowledge and abilitys :)
Finally, I did not believe this was proper on either side because it is very capable of being on both, even at the same time.
Though it fluctuates and it could come out negatively as well, the value of bitcoin gives you some ability over time to possibly gain a return from what you're making. Thus, given a suitable environment, the coins you have could gain in fiat conversion value... thereby increasing the actual worth of what you were paid.
The reason this fills both sides, negative and positive, are both because just like the stock market it can go up and down... but also because it requires you to pay attention to the value of those coins (ballpark) so that if they you will need to maintain awareness of the amount they are supposed to pay you and the amount they give.
Anyways, I applaud you for the initiative! Good luck! I think it is a wonderful idea.

While idealistically we may want to be able to believe that we are capable of funding a neutral core structure, I don't know how feasible it is. It is difficult to truly account for what MIT is taking on here - this isn't like paying $1500 for a particular core bug to be fixed. While I would love to sit and dream of a core technology where the product is the sum of the collective fund and work, on such a large technology that's a lot of mouths to feed while achieving a great deal of actual work.
I've sat staring at this comment trying to come up with any long term, successful project that has achieved such a feat. I cannot. That doesn't mean it is impossible, nor does it mean it hasn't been done - but at the very least knowing what we know about every factor - dishonest and honest - involved... I really can't give hope to its reality.
I just hope MIT is a valuable and supportive influence/control.

Decision theory is a fun subject, perception tends to follow odd paradoxical trends that to the secondary observer seem obviously bad.
The goal of these schemes is to generate that thought - similar to a casino keeping players playing or pay to win games generating more tiny reasons to upgrade.
The presentation of possible gains, value earned, probabilities, testimonials and trusted marketing from celebrities or central figures, the mark develops a dream and justifies by believing positives and trusting the "risk" factors presented.
A secondary effect is those that fall for it and see immediate returns that "demonstrate" further the lies being truthful begins the marketing for down lines in the pyramid. Rather than rely solely on the initial presentation, word of mouth assists in the further growth (and wealth) for the con(s) at the pinnacle.
A lot can go into the factors for susceptibility. Religious exploitation using trusted figures in the central religious hierarchy, cultural perception of power figures being implicitly trusted, economic conditions, dreams...
In other words, like a magic trick. Except instead of fooling the mind with difficult to explain phenomena, it's peoples lives and well being.

Does this put the case at risk if their ethics were in question during their investigation? Would this be valuable in a/their appeal? Though I mean the whole situation itself doesn't have much to do with their involvement at all, but, if the execution of the information gathering they performed was done outside of the ethics that establish trust and reliability of the word and information delivered by the officers, would this not violate the reliability (or expected reliability) of the officers... and harm Ulbrichts' rights to a fare and honest trial?

haeqon, bravo for the work - I would tip but at the moment I'm empty. I think it is atrocious that a company would lie about the availability of the source. Security auditing aside, the source demonstrates wrong doing (or, the lack thereof). I don't even really mind seeing the security side of it, I largely disbelieve in the concept of a hosted wallet to begin with (its not a matter of how, its a matter of when.). I have always been concerned with the visibility blockchain.info has had, both as the seemingly go-to place for blockchain visualization and polling... and as a larger source of online wallets. The value of that information to the person that connects the dots, is insurmountably underestimated.
Then again, I'm really surprised that people still use online wallets.
After installwallet, btc-e, bitcoinica (TWICE!!!!), BTC Faucet, OKPay, BTCGuild, mybitcoin (TWICE!!!!), bitcash.cz, inputs.io, bitfloor, mt.gox, and I'm sure there are others that I've missed....
I can't get passed this. I don't really understand it either. Why is this the case?
These sites don't need to be poorly developed or susceptible to everyday scripting violations to be hacked. Hell, 3 of the sites in the above list were hacked due to the same thing: it was a physical theft AT the hosting company. It had nothing to do with the code, it was an inside job, at the place they trusted to host your money. The same place mind you. On the same day. [Linode Theft]( for more info on that one.
Does that mean don't hold bitcoins? Hell no! Bitcoin is a safe, absolutely wonderful, BRILLIANT advancement of financial theory, and an absolutely delicious application of math and absolute determinency to a world largely built on cheating. However, it is only as safe as you allow it to be. Just because of its foundation in cryptography and security in general, that does not make everything involving it secure. You have a wallet: guard it like you would any other wallet. Don't trust it with someone else, keep it with you. There is tons of information on how to maintain a secure wallet on your own. You don't need blockchain.info and its pretty forms to do it!
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:51:00
Yes, it will. Bitinstant will come back, its just a matter of time (and patience on our part). To a certain extent, because of [FinCEN]( (the money laundering laws/bills), all exchanges are required to retain certain identity information. This is the basic reason for why places like Mt. Gox ran into issues with the fed, and why most places require identification for verification (for example BTCQuick requires you to validate your identity either through independent outside sources or by uploading a picture of yourself with your ID).
So, to that effect, anonymity is almost entirely gone from the account on the site itself, with exception to individual trades through local bitcoin transactions (i.e., [LocalBitcoins](
However, the ability to do the other parts anonymously will exist forever. The reason is that for small amounts places like MoneyGram are not required to report the transaction (under $999). So, as long as you do values that are under what MoneyGram (or Western Union) require, you'll have no problems at all.
I do know that there is quite a lot of discussion on bitcointalk about the anonymity problem in the states. FinCEN is proving very difficult to argue around. There have been a few attempts to start anonymous trading centers on Tor but either due to distrust (there isn't a good track record of responsibility regarding Tor run BTC sites) or because of lack of sustainable interest, they haven't taken off.

A [Paper Wallet]( is a physical paper (or paper like) object with a private key on it. A paper wallet is an all or nothing thing, you lose the ability to have multiple transactions with it. It is a reasonably good method for keeping a wallet safe, but overall it is not a day-to-day type object for use.
Having a wallet online is absolutely not a good thing, especially with the amount of money you are holding on to. There have been a great many thefts and impacted events in the bitcoin world, and at least three of them did not require an insecure site or a degraded reputation for the operators. Three sites got hit, on the same day, by (what is speculated to be an employee at the hosting company) someone who had physical access to the machines.
Without getting into too much detail, I highly recommend at least moving to your own wallet. Always remember there are two ways to recover a wallet:
1) A wallet file backup. I have noticed a lot of online wallets will produce one for you, but I don't necessarily see much guidance (or any abundance of recommendation) on their use or value.
2) From the block chain. Almost every bitcoin client now supports this. How it works is pretty simple. When you create a wallet, you'll be given a group of words in a mostly random mnemonic. This is the equivalent to the 256bit private key hash that refers to your wallet in the blockchain. You can either import it directly, or "sweep" it into a new wallet, which given that this hash/mnemonic would give anyone the ability to do that, its highly recommend that it be protected heavily.
Technically speaking, the system works the same for both options. The private key gives you access to the stored information for said private key. That's all you need to send money, IS the private key (as with the private key the public key(s) are determined). Storing that data, is especially the type of thing PGP was made for in the first place. Encrypt it using PGP, and you can keep many copies without risk to their being broken so long as you keep the private key safely separate.
Worker mentions armory. Absolutely a great application. I use Electrum myself. Both have the ability to encrypt wallets. In any case, congratulations on the fortunate situation you've found yourself in. Don't forget to support the currency and purchase from a place that accepts bitcoin, keep its success going!

You work at a company which is a part of a stateless community. That community does not consider it useless in any way. We aren't here to flame or harm. It was very obvious that the OP was concerned, not there to insult. His efforts were in the interests of all parties involved, especially the entire basis for your company's existence.
You have a responsibility as an employee, and as a member of the bitcoin community, to provide not only transparency so that we know what or who is snooping on the output from the blockchain, who is using the data from your wallets, and who is fielding data from both and interpreting that. This is intrinsic to the freedom that is bitcoin, and to do otherwise is to invite the very criticism that you are so quickly marking yourself as useless to participate.
More than that, bitcoin is only as strong as its weakest link. Look at the losses we have faced over the last 3 years, with 100,000s of coins most likely gone from this planet because of carelessness and haphazard handling. On top of that, we have investors who were absolutely destroyed because they trusted the only people willing to innovate on this technology, losing out on the very people we needed to fight regulation.
You have an obligation, an intrinsic responsibility, to honor the concerns and the experience that the community has. We can help you. All that we ask, is that you let us. We are not here to compete with you, we are not here to throw you in the dirt, we are not here to steal or rob you. We are here because we want this currency to be seen as safe, we want it to exist as an alternative to the worlds catastrophe that is the financial system.
We might not use your service, or even believe in the value of a hosted wallet. Many of us feel the same about most of the socialized technologies today. That should not scare you. You should not see this as a threat. See it for what it is: we are critical of your technology, and that can only serve to make you better if you fulfill our criticisms and actually shut us up.
Prove us wrong. Make it better. Make us want to use it, and you will solve the greatest problem on the internet: you'll have mainstreamed what more frequently takes the concord above the heads of others the second you say "cryptocurrency." Why? Because you'll make it safe.
I for one, would really be interested in what you truly have to say.

They buy blocks of 50 at a time. Sometimes they go quick, sometimes they stick around. One of the aspects that tends to be difficult with bitcoin is the availability of them.
Credit cards pose a big issue in the bit coin landscape as, unfortunately, they are a target for fraud. Chargebacks in a non-reversible transaction are inherently an impossible situation. Beyond BTCQuick, I don't have much of a suggestion.
I used to use bit instant a lot, especially since I could do it anonymously. However, they ran into some issues when they released an update back in july/august, and as a result they've temporarily (I hope) closed. They used to allow instant buys to occur using places like moneygram (walmart, essentially). It was nice, as it could be done with cash, if I kept the amount lower than the ID required clause I could do it without using my name/anonymously, and the total transaction wouldn't take longer than 20-30 minutes.
I'll ask around and see if I can find any other non-bank sources, but, more often than not its been fruitless.

I've been using [BTCQuick]( myself for credit card BTC purchases. They use google checkout, so you don't have to store your credit card (or even give it to them). They're currently running a special or something if you reach a certain level of validated identity. I've purchased ~50 btc from them since they launched.

Any problems with BTC that China will have, won't even come close to something like a nickname for the smallest denomination. It's ability to be used without impedance by the government, without (much) oversight, and to be involved in state-restricted topics and interests... thats much more the kind of situation I expect to find with China.
Now, I fear an oncoming of "typical US rhetoric" here, but its the same fear that every other government has with BTC. It's a regulatory nightmare, something that can't be reversed and is without inherent restriction. Anonymous be damned - its not taxable!
The "Satoshi" as it were, already has other names, most notably bitcoinbong. It's name as a Satoshi is a community driven thing, more/less a nickname... and, for the most part, I feel as the currency grows there has been more of a desire to go to a standard form of measurement (i.e., SI units) - as can be very well seen in the recent usage of the mBTC, µBTC, milibtc and so on.

I am extremely curious on some of the extended reasons for your choices. I find these requirements interesting, as it risks the (arguably) most valuable asset (assets of monetary value), against a system that you ironically describe as different than the system you try to avoid.


Is just a collection of those same single computers you don't trust, except they're collected together in a non-redundant software-defined object that is, largely, not backed up. Most cloud systems require you to maintain your own in varying degrees... the exception, of course, being online "cloud" backup solutions. Regardless of any of this, my trust issues skyrocket when its a system that is shared. I have a lot more trust in a system that counts its users on a single hand. 




What is it precisely you do not trust them with, losing the coins... or keeping the wallet file safe/protected with a pass phrase?
As a child, my allowance was a responsibility, on multiple levels. Keeping hold of the money I was given, not using it, and keeping track of it, was invaluable in my growth. That later changed to things like my social security card, the number on it, my passport, and so on. Bitcoin doesn't make this easy, given its lack of physical nature. It doesn't HAVE to lack physical nature though. When I was very young, my allowance was quite literally nothing more than monopoly money that had come from a set that was dismantled and long replaced. It's no different than the currency that you keep in your real wallet - it guarantees a value. I enjoyed this quite a bit back then, as it was rewarding: I actually felt as though I was getting paid. In a way, I was - when I had collected enough for what I wanted to buy, I turned it in and my parents took me to the store.
More than that though, my father instilled in me a respect for the security of my valuables. Keys, if you will, to the kingdom. With the way the world is going, everything is protected by a password - most usually, a bad one. We spend so much time trying to balance memory with security, something that is largely impossible. This does not preclude the ability to be secure, with a memorable password though. Is there a reason you do not just simply teach the kids good practice with PGP?


One of the reasons places like blockchain.info is such a risk, is not because of their accessibility. Its because a lot of people tend to think what blockchain.info does, is unique. The reality is, a wallet is just a collection of public and private key hashes. You can import those keys into any client that supports importing - and most wallet applications now also provide you with the parent hash, to obtain the entire wallet tree. Sometimes it is in the form of a 12 (or something) word pneumonic, otherwise its in the form of your standard 256-bit key, ie: 0a1741577b588f2dcb9ad708ea1c44c973d9150d449b64a990a30e331f8321bf (note: this is just the sha256 of "hashme"). An offline wallet is only offline in the idea that the majority of work done with it is in an offline state... the wallet exists online perpetually. What adds to the risk with blockchain.info, is it stores this info in a potentially world-readable format. 
I agree with you in that, risk mitigation is the key. It is actually a very interesting topic to me, given that everyone identifies (and rates) risk differently. Myself, I consider any public infrastructure that I do not control, risky. I also consider any system that is complicated, risky. Therefor my system is simple, and it limits the risk - I don't need or require anything more than the PGP encrypted data, the private key, and the pass phrase for my private key. Whats contained in the data, may be the rest of the keys, may be the wallet, etc. The point is, I rely on a system largely in my control. The advantage being, it works for any data, works on any system, is universally accepted, and its weakest point is the choices I make, and I alone.
