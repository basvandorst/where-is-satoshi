What does this mean exactly? Like...should one have not bought from Coinbase right now? If so, which would be the best place to buy from currently?
If you have stuff on Coinbase, should you be transferring it now to something else?

Like, I just recently did a small purchase and have already run the transfer, it's currently pending. Will those coins I'm transferring to my own wallet still have value?
Also, who to use? I've also created a Gemini account and am waiting on verification. Are they no good either?

Okay, so that's exactly what I did. Buy on CB and then instantly transferred to my software wallet for now. If I go further/higher with my investment, I'm probably gonna get a trezor. So it's still safe for purchases alone to use CB/Gemini for purchasing, just not storing. Period...if I have that right.

Whoops. I thought the whole point of linking a bank account was less wait? Maybe I'm thinking of something else...

Care to elaborate?
Posts like these seem pretty positive:

Guess I somehow got lucky being a new account, then.

Literally signed up overnight last night and did an instant buy immediately on CB. Only problem was using the card you had to be sure to allow the UK charge w/ your bank, which worked once I did that. Also already transferred to my own wallet, which is completed according to CB but I'm still syncing the desktop app so waiting for the balance to reflect. Seems to be smooth sailing.

Where are the safe/good places to purchase currently...or is it simply all about where you store them?

And so what would be the better options then? That sounds a lot like what has been already said about Coinbase, only they're supposedly way worse.
