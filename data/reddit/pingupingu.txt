Yes, they often tie their money into other vast real estate, i.e like monopoly, which they would then be taxed on the value of the land. How do you not get this concept?

It's neither anti-capitalist nor anti-bank, it was an exercise to show the need for Land Value Tax. Henry George even theorised that it could potentially replace all other taxes.

Yes, look at how terrible its getting.

That is the point, increasing construction and the supply of houses which will helps with with rent and property prices, supply increases, price falls. Land Value Tax increases the efficient use of the land itself. Just read the wiki, dude.

Do you get the concept of a land tax? The higher the value of your land, the bigger the tax you pay. It is the definition of a progressive tax, where the heaviest burden falls on the wealthiest.

LAND VALUE TAX, mate. We are talking about a hypothetical LAND VALUE TAX that scales with how much value the land is and which would not be tax deductible (or have limits) and would not vary by County. 
Their have been countless studies that show it is a progressive tax where the burden falls on the wealthy and improves the efficient use of the land itself.

Binswanger-Mkhize, Hans P; Bourguignon, Camille; Brink, Rogier van den (2009). Agricultural Land Redistribution : Toward Greater Consensus. World Bank. "A land tax is considered a progressive tax in that wealthy landowners normally should be paying relatively more than poorer landowners and tenants. Conversely, a tax on buildings can be said to be regressive, falling heavily on tenants who generally are poorer than the landlords"

I'm struggling to understand what you're trying to say here. This ceteris paribus, i.e all things being equal. Land tax is usually percentage of value. Comparing different rates doesn't make LVT any less progressive. The people with higher values are still paying more tax. Most countries also have partial or even full exemptions for primary residences, or only have the tax come into effect past a certain valuation.
At the end of your massive paragraph you're not even talking about land tax, but other property taxes. The beauty of land tax is is that it cannot be passed on to tenants!

You are really not getting it. I'm talking about Land Value Tax, not property or building taxes. If you have a dude with land worth $5mil and has to pay 2%, he's paying $100k a year in land tax, versus someone with a house worth 500k that has a primary residence exemption. Or a mum and dad investor with a $1mil land holdings that then only pays $20k a year in land tax. 
Again, as I said, most places that have  instituted land value tax, like Australia, have exemptions for people's primary residences/homes.

And when the $26 floor line breaks....its down to 18-20 for next support. But gold/silver could make a recovery again..like bitcoins..no one knows the future, apart from insider traders. With volatile assets its always good to only put in what you can definitely not feel terrible about 100% losing.
