My name is Danny Bocanegra, I work at Xapo and am the Dir. of Bus Dev mentioned in WingZeroG's comment. 
First of all, thank you to the community here for proliferating the ecosystem I care deeply about and giving me an opportunity for a meaningful career that also happens to pay me a salary. 
More importantly, I wanted to shed some clarity on this customer service inquiry. 
I saw at least 15 separate customer support inquiries, all of which were sent in a matter of 3 days at all hours of the day/night, and on separate tickets. Furthermore, each ticket was minimum of 2-3 paragraphs with 3 noob UI questions embedded in each.  
Jessie answered all of them and asked me for help on a particular transaction question. I answered clearly, succinctly, and was overwhelmingly thanked by WingZeroG. I politely asked customer to direct all future questions to me and not Jessie (before the post above). An onslaught of 5 separate customer tickets were sent to Jessie the following morning.  
Truth is, is that Jessie answers a hundred legitimate customer service questions a day in regards to our product, she can be classified as a bitcoin "noob", and is a recent college grad. As you've seen from most posts on Reddit about our service, Jessie is doing an incredible job for Xapo and bitcoin. With that said, I wouldn't expect someone her age to know how to respond to someone who seemed (not is) like a "troll" - so I intervened and don't regret my responses. 
I understand you (customer) were attempting to move money from Coinbase and I respect your business, but if it is this much of a hassle and as I responded I care about your well being so I would suggest keeping your money there - its a great service and company.
Thank you kindly, 
Danny
