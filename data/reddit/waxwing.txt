This can simply be slightly bad luck. Confirmation times are not fixed, it's a random process - see the graphs [here](


(1) The amount of the transaction (0.03) is irrelevant. What matters is the size of the transaction in bytes. (2) That fee looks static, any decent wallet uses dynamic fees based on transaction size.


Because there's nothing to address: 
If your wallet is failing you, or you have not configured it properly, fix that.

Yes, and note (a) that such a reversal did not happen in Bitcoin, and (b) such a reversal *did* happen in Ethereum, with consequences - a hardfork where some people chose to ignore it. In the long term I believe an immutable ledger is going to persist in Bitcoin, since that was central to its original purpose. But there is no law of the universe guaranteeing that someday, all Bitcoin users won't wake up and say "you know what, I'd prefer it if we all rolled back transaction X".
Btw doing such a rollback transaction has a nasty technical side effect, because the transaction is not within the ruleset of the chain, and so you can no longer cryptographically verify the entire history (a bit like what's called a "checkpoint"). But that's a kind of subtle point that could be argued about.
But none of this is the kind of insecurity being discussed in this thread, it's an entirely different problem imo.

Don't know. The tumbler needs liquidity to service all the payments (doesn't seem a big deal at all really), also if A=B then you'd need network level anonymity, I think, to avoid T trivially knowing the input-output payment linkage simply by the fact it's coming from the same network connection. This is in line with what Maxwell said in the original coinjoin post (you can use Chaumian blinding to separate the receiver from the signing act, except it's a super-charged analog of that, but then you still need to disconnect at network level between these two steps). To be fair the paper describes them as separate epochs, they give the example of a full day between setup and payout, so using Tor is almost certainly enough for that, maybe there are other things that could be done.
(Edit: I just realised this *may* miss the point, in that Alice and Bob can communicate entirely out of band. Probably that is much more sensible, not sure).
There are probably a bunch of other things to think about. I've just earlier today finished more-or-less understanding the protocol. What's nice/refreshing here is, they actually posted code for a test run (

A subtlety that may be lost on people - multisig can allow a DNM to operate without holding all the active-in-trade funds at once. Whereas if you want to use an exchange to do real-time trading, you have to give them custody of your funds (barring some future highly advanced tech). So even if not true in practice, in principle a DNM's exit scam incentive *can* actually be lower.

A brief read:
* It's mostly about classifying transactions into types, not so really about de-obfuscation techniques. Hence all these tweets and whatnot "Bitfury deanonymises mixing!!" err .. did you read it?
* It stresses the NP-completeness of solving the input-output connection problem (one of the variants of the subset sum problem), maybe it's me but isn't this obvious? Perhaps they emphasize it because they are thinking about large scale whole-blockchain analysis
* Figure 8 shows "Simple" transactions as a subset of Shared Send transactions, while the Abstract clearly states "Simple transaction: A transaction not produced as a result of a shared send operation". Making a whole set of new categories/names is perfectly understandable and reasonable to aid the analysis, but it's pretty important then to make the definitions clear and non-contradictory!
* Conclusion seems a little slanted to me:


Basically what this comes down to is actual coinjoins (where the ambiguity mentioned is deliberately enforced) are a subset of the ~1-1.5% of transactions they find to fit their "ambiguous" definition. The others, the "separable" transactions are a more dubious case; there may be various reasons for their existence, but they don't achieve a goal of obfuscating linkage, obviously.
Saying "Interestingly, about half of these transactions are able to be untangled." gives the misleading impression that "half of these mixing transactions fail and can be analyzed", but one would first have to find out whether those transactions were made with the *intention* of tangling, I don't think we (can) know that.
The paper says nothing about how to analyze and de-obfuscate equal sized coinjoin outputs (or equivalent forms of ambiguity such that input-output linkage is obscured).

If you're seeing stealability as a problem of Bitcoin you may be partly missing the point. It was designed to be like that - cash. If it can't be stolen it isn't cash, because if it can't be stolen it isn't a bearer instrument with no counterparty risk.
If you want to discuss how ordinary people can hold it and feel about as comfortable as they do holding an equivalent amount of cash, that's a good argument. But comparing it to bank deposits or credit cards profoundly misses the point.

It makes a lot of difference for privacy, but it doesn't help in this scenario: the issue here is that the size, in bitcoins, of the inputs you're spending is so small that the cost of spending them is very large in comparison. That would still be true if they were all on different addresses.

It's digital cash. This isn't a weakness of the system, it's the central point - no counterparty risk, but you have full responsibility. There is every possibility to create higher layers that offer protection, just as there would be in a world with gold as the reserve and banks issuing IOUs based on gold (as in the past). It is hindered by an aggressively anti-Bitcoin position by those in power (not that that's the only problem, but it's one of them - it's almost impossible for a Bitcoin business to get a bank account).

Bob's payment originates from the Tumbler; so the Tumbler needs to have the coins available to pay. And Alice pays the Tumbler, in an entirely separate transaction.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:49:08
The implication being, that if you held the API keys (which Bitfinex of course had to), you could delete all policy restrictions on signing, meaning that Bitgo would sign every blank check you sent it. Thus API key + key 1 for multisig = 100% control, making Bitgo's "security" literally worthless.
Disclaimer: this is surmise, I might be wrong.
Edit: it looks like it needs some kind of 2nd factor code (the "Unlock" API feature mentioned there) to call this method. I guess if so, the attacker got that too?
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:15:36
Use payment channels to escrow coins from Alice(A) - Tumbler(T) and from T - Bob(B). As usual there are timeouts so you can recover the coins if the protocol doesn't complete.
Then, crypto magic enables this: B to get an encrypted ECDSA signature on a transaction for 1BTC from T. He can pass this to A who can get a provably valid decryption key for that from T, in exchange for a payment of 1 BTC (this is a provably "fair exchange", neither side can cheat). Then A can pay B with that decryption key. The decryption key is "blinded" which means that only B can unblind it, and use it to decrypt the signature and publish the transaction from T and receive his 1 BTC.
Upshot is that T cannot steal the coins and cannot know which A paid which B. And in a "classic tumbler model" of usage (there are others), A can be the same as B, so the purpose is merely to mix your own coins.
The concept is that many As and many Bs do this at once, and there are only two transactions on the blockchain, and since the pay-in and pay-out are not connected, you could have a huge number (&gt; 500) of A-&gt;B payments in one run of the whole protocol.

Not so much "for a number of reasons", I think, as "by the fundamental principle of the system", which is what's recently been termed "DMMS", dynamic membership multiparty signature, there is **no identity** in the system and there must not be. "Solutions" involve creating identities which violates the p2p-ness and create points of centralization.

If you have 2 of 3 they are *your* coins, and that doesn't work for a real-time trading exchange; for them to be able to allow instant trading you must be in a credit relationship - i.e. you give them custody of the coins, they move balances on a database, and update the real bitcoin balances based on that. Wouldn't be much point in them having a database of balances, but have the user just withdraw the coins if the trade went against them...

Yes, this is the "guarantee" of full faith and credit, the specifically circular guarantee of all fiat currencies. It works perfectly up until that faith and credit is lost, as seen in countless historical examples of currency collapse. See e.g. Reinhardt and Rogoff's "This Time It's Different" (And of course, countries' financial authorities are usually more sensible than to say 'we guarantee everything'; they are mindful of the moral hazard problem, at least up to lip service - they don't generally explicitly say "we guarantee it all", and occasionally they will make banks and their creditors eat it).
@_date: 2016-08-28 17:54:01
The core idea of ring signatures, generally (not just Monero) is: N people sign a document, when you come to verify, you can't tell *which* of the N people signed, you just know that *at least one of them did*, and the cryptography guarantees you can't tell.
Now, in Bitcoin, when you spend money, you sign with the private key of the coin(utxo) you're spending. It's not a ring signature, it's an ordinary digital signature. So, it's possible for an observer to know *which* coin has done that spending, and they can trace through the blockchain to find connections and build histories of addresses, wallets etc.
As for how it works in Monero, I'm not the guy to ask really, I did read through the crypto structure last year but forgot the details; all I know is, because it's a ring sig, you can't establish who is the true original spender, but that also means you can't mark your spending coin(utxo) as now "spent", meaning you can't treat it differently. In Bitcoin, once coins are spent, you don't, in principle, need to keep them around since nothing else can happen with them (see "pruning"), although you *might* need to see them when you initially sync (you want to prove, independently of trusting someone else, that the currently unspent coins are real by parsing through the blockchain history).
From what little I've gleaned on the topic, there'll be similar issue with Zcash, although it's a different tech (zksnarks not ring sigs), it's the same basic point that if you maintain anonymity by not making who has spent public info, you can't prune in the same way. Something like that.
@_date: 2016-08-12 10:21:16
They also publish your trade amounts and times over their API to anyone who wants to read. Not names, but amount and time correlation are very useful to those trying to spy on your transfers. Also the more basic point is that they are a centralized point and so you only have their word that they're not keeping full logs and giving them to anyone.

In the past, the Chinese govt certainly *did* subsidise electricity costs, and may well still do today, I don't know. And yes for Bitcoin miners that can be part of the situation (for a brief period, this effect happened in Venezuela too, although at a tiny scale, even when it was working, I'm sure), but another part can be things like stranded hydro: a lot of not-market-directed investment in electricity production that there wasn't a good case for on pure demand terms, then a Bitcoin miner (who doesn't care about location), eats up the unwanted supply at rock bottom prices.

This is false in the sense that it implies that other coinjoin implementations require you to trust a third party with your coins. Guaranteed tons of people are misled into believing that's what it means, which is why I have to spend so much time on reddit explaining this point :)
Moreover it is also false because coinshuffle is not the only way to achieve the scenario of no single party knowing the entire set of linkages.
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:10:44
Sure, but in general, not as vulnerable as non-cold. The real problem is that you can't know in detail the security policy of a third party, they are a target for hackers if they hold a lot of coins, and insider theft is always possible also. It is *always* a meaningful risk to use a centralized exchange. If you have to use them, do it quickly and get your coins out.
@_date: 2016-08-22 09:37:58


Coinjoin has no trusted third party.
That's why: "0. Right now: centralized mixers/coinjoin" is unfortunate, they are fundamentally different things, the first is relying on trust not only for privacy but for custody of coins, while the latter has no trust requirement at all for custody (custody is never transferred), and for privacy its model depends on how it's set up.
Coinshuffle is about making the linkage in a coinjoin transaction obfuscated from all participants; it's a protocol for setting up a coinjoin.

Tell that to people getting negative interest rates on their deposits, or people shut out of access to their bank account, or forced to "participate" in bail-ins. To be fair, yes, some people do think cash is becoming rapidly irrelevant (I note that it's mostly people in positions of privilege), while plenty of others argue vocally that it must be kept. What cash has that electronic forms of fiat money can never have is zero counterparty risk, that is why it's important even if it's not interesting technologically (and also why Bitcoin matters).

@_date: 2016-08-05 12:44:45


It's just like cash in these matters. For trade you need trust relationships of *some* sort, but it doesn't have to be government. My complaint with government regulation of commercial activities or just financial activity generally, is not that it exists, but that I have to be bound by the same rules as *everyone* else. It's far too much concentration of power in the regulator, leads to corruption, and even if there isn't corruption, the rules created are suitable for the "typical" person, not for me.
One simple example I find odious: certain investments are only open to "qualified investors" (which actually means people with a ton of money). This is done to "protect the little guy", which in general it might actually succeed in doing, but it also shuts people out who might be perfectly "qualified" but just poor.
There is nothing wrong with third party arbitration when the arbiter is someone else than government; there will be pros and cons, but it would be nice to be able to choose.
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:40:01


That's because it's cash. A more powerful form of cash that can be transferred digitally, so a larger effect. Nobody looks down on US dollars because they're used in crime all over the world.


Far less than the existing monetary system ("all the trust that's required to make it work"), especially if you consider the indirect effect of military power/hegemony on the trust in a fiat money (which you should - even Krugman agrees, quote: "fiat is backed by men with guns").


I've been meaning to write about this because there is a massive delusion going on: the "community" is not only irrelevant, it's somehow the opposite of relevant. Money and community are almost antithetical concepts.

This is such an oversimplification that it's close to being just wrong. I don't have to trust Chinese miners when I send a transaction. They *could* censor it, if they teamed up, and have *everyone in the world know that they did it*. Consider the implications. And those 10/12 guys do not control *all* the mining power, not even close, so it's not as if I couldnt' get it mined somewhere else.
Yes, it's bad to have too few large mining farms, but it's not the oft repeated "10 guys in China control Bitcoin". That's just completely wrong, but suits the agenda of some people, and others don't like nuance so just go with that.

There is no requirement for coinjoin protocols to have a point of centralization, as is explained the original coinjoin [post]( (Ctrl-F "Does the totally private version need to have a server at all?").
And coinshuffle doesn't really change that; what it does is allows a negotiation process that obfuscates the input-output linkages from *all* participants, instead of obscuring from all except a central server, or all participants except one (the one that creates the transaction). Blind sigs as referred to above can also do that. Coinshuffle could either go over a central messaging server or a peer to peer network, just as any other coinjoin protocol could (and while servers have disadvantages, don't forget that actual messages can be end-to-end encrypted so they don't have to be allowed to snoop; the point is that the server is not a participant (in most models), it's just a network layer implementation detail, albeit it's a weakness in exactly that sense).


Hmm, *today* there isn't much meaningful saving you could achieve from payments using Coinjoin (a small saving, technically), but it's a hassle to coordinate with other parties, I guess that's the main reason people don't aggregate arbitrary spending transactions, if that's what you meant.
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:57:29
Disagree about 'fugitive'. Example: go travelling somewhere and don't want evidence of my Bitcoin wallet on your laptop (thieves, corrupt customs agents, whatever). Since it *is* possible to have a high entropy passphrase (this is the critical point that a lot of experts have missed and erroneously stated as to be impractical), you can do that. I've stored more than one such in my brain, without significant effort, for many years. It might be worth reflecting on the fact that people are able to remember entire *books* in extreme cases. The human brain works in a certain way, and if you exploit that, you can store extremely high entropy secrets without much effort.
That doesn't mean you use your brain as your permanent storage; that is incautious. But the possibility exists whenever it's needed, and that's a hugely important point.

Coinjoin is trustless (as for that matter is coinswap although nobody uses that).
@_date: 2016-08-24 11:26:52
Correct, and note that it mainly puts a lower limit on the bitcoin size you're using for which using joinmarket in that mode is economical.
E.g. amounts &lt; $100 it gets impractical quite quickly, ~ $1000 it's non-zero but it won't bother you, $5000+ and you can pretty much forget the btc tx fees, even with 7 counterparties x 10 transactions you're probably not paying more than 0.015 btc tx fees for the whole thing, which is a rounding error on 8.6 btc ($5000).
There are technologies that might make this problem (small amount difficult to delink with coinjoin due to tx size -&gt; cost) go away; e.g. aggregated Schnorr signatures to make coinjoins collapse down to smaller size. And there are like 10 other things that might address privacy in other ways than coinjoin too.

You're not the only one who finds this ultra confusing to begin with :) The secret to understanding it is to think of Bitcoin as a system of "coins" which are **not** bitcoins (BTC/bitcoins is just a measuring unit), but "utxos" (unspent transaction outputs). At any time you might hold a bunch of these "coins" in different denominations (0.234btc, 1.6btc) etc. They're spendable because they're currently "unspent". Some of them might be attached to different addresses, some might be attached to the same address, that doesn't matter - the addresses are like pseudonyms, you can have as many as you want, but for ordinary utxos only one such pseudonym is authorised to spend that one utxo. Now, the way that utxos are different from ordinary coins is: when you spent them, they disappear (they're one-time usage tokens), and new ones are created. So it's like:
inputs: utxos you are spending (and "destroying" - one time usage)
outputs: newly created utxos.
You're allowed to create as many utxos of whatever denomination you like in that output list, and you can attach them to any address (pseudonym) you like, including a new one (preferable actually); the only restriction is that their total value has to be less than the total value of the input coins you're spending.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:39:01
Not the same; they're not securing bearer instruments. There is absolutely massive fraud, especially via credit cards, but a lot can be reversed. The reversibility is what makes the difference - see e.g. one of the recent SWIFT hanks, the Bangladesh central bank - $1 billion was withdrawn, but the thieves only kept ~$80million.
It's not a simple matter, there's a lot more to say and argue about, but this is a very fundamental difference.

Writing down is an option (a sensible one in general). The mnemonic technique makes it easy to remember, also. See  for some explanation. Note that using seed phrases makes literally *writing* down (rather than printing) entirely practical.
I'm using the common sense interpretation of the term; this is, by the way, a deliberate reappropriation from those who, earlier in Bitcoin's history, exclusively chose to use it as meaning "a wallet generated from a **user-generated** memorized phrase". This is dumb, because that's not the crucial concept: the crucial concept is not "user-generated" but "able to be stored in human memory". And the latter *can* be achieved securely by using seed phrases in the way I described above.

I take your point, but thinking about it this way makes me see why Liquid as an idea maybe makes some sense; "ordinary" usage has to be on mainchain because of legacy infrastructure, but "backend" transactions (intra or inter- exchange as an example, perhaps some other clearing style transactions) could be done this way, taking load off main chain.

Japan has been trying various forms of this "shock" approach already, to no avail, including trillions in stimulus, dabbling with ZIRP and NIRP, and buying up some ludicrously large fraction of the ETFs in their own stock market, for what, a decade and a half?. The hubris of these people is shocking, the evidence is staring them in the face that their models are broken and ineffective, but they are not swayed by evidence apparently.
The worst thing about QE is how obscene it is that the money is given directly to the class of people who caused the crisis in the first place. I don't believe in the helicopter money approach either, but it is the only version that should have been considered.

Ring signatures mean the history of coins is not deducible, which is a great anonymizing approach. The flip side is because the ring signatures deliberately obfuscate which one of X "coins" is the signer, you can't distinguish spent and unspent outputs. In the long term this seems to mean you can get an unbounded growth in utxo set you have to manage.
Warning: I have only very vague knowledge of this, I may be wrong in the above.

It's technically cheaper even without cleverness if A is paying B and C is paying D, to make a tx (A,C -&gt; B, D), ignoring whether the amounts are the same and whether there is any privacy benefit, since a few per-tx overhead bytes are now shared; the main bulk of the bytes are in the inputs and outputs, and that doesn't change.
But there are more advanced ideas floating around based on Schnorr batched signatures which could make a coinjoin dramatically cheaper (sharing signature bytes). That's not in Bitcoin today, I've only read a few things here and there so not sure of how far along that concept is.
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:17:55
I haven't watched this yet but Andreas, along with several other people, has previously made what I believe to be an error by stating (paraphrase):
"Bitcoin couldn't have done what Ethereum did in the case of the DAO, because Bitcoin uses the utxo model, whereas Ethereum uses an account model, and that's why Ethereum was able to re-assign balances without rolling back history which (might be / is) impossible/impractical in Bitcoin."
This is false, isn't it? The actual difference between a Mt Gox and a theDAO is that in the latter case, the "undesirably acquired"/"stolen" funds were locked up in one location for a long period. If a similar thing happened in Bitcoin; that for some reason the stolen funds are time locked and not moving around/splitting, Bitcoin could do a similarly simple hard fork; it could similarly break the consensus rules for specific utxos. The point is that if you're prepared to do a hardfork which no longer respects the rule of transfers/"state transitions" only with valid signatures, you can do absolutely anything (I guess you could also stop respecting the rule of money conservation in transactions). It is a stupendously terrible idea (a bit like adding a second genesis block), but sure, you can do it.

This is misleading/wrong in two ways; first, a traditional centralized mixing service (not coinjoin) requires handing over ownership of coins to the mixing service; no implementation of coinjoin requires that. Second, as described in the original coinjoin post, you can use blind signing to break knowledge of output ownership, so coinshuffle is not the only way to achieve that.
In Joinmarket there is a central messaging server (or multiple in the latest version) but data is e2e encrypted so that doesn't matter modulo DoS. Similarly DarkWallet had a "lobby". Btw coinshuffle and coinshuffle++ still require somewhere to do the messaging, so that's not the difference here.
Coinshuffle is a way of having no participants knowing ownership of outputs, rather than just 1 in a model like Joinmarket (the "taker", who pays for the privilege). Again, you could do this with blind signatures too. There are lots of trade-offs in the different coinjoin setups. I think one can say something like: Coinshuffle is one good way to increase the privacy of a coinjoin protocol, although it adds a fair amount of extra messaging interactivity, albeit that might not be too big of a deal.
There is a privacy weakness that can't be addressed, though: in order to sign a transaction you have to see it unencrypted; at that point a privacy attacker who pretends to take part gets to see the proposed input utxos. This can be useful to a spy depending on ... stuff.

It's not so much that the money is unlikely to be lost, it's that the nature of the money concerned means that it can be willed back into existence at any time; a bank deposit is just an IOU, and if the bank doesn't like the state of the ledger it can just rewrite it (there are limits of course, but in general).
But the broader point is clear: Bitcoin like cash or gold requires that you take the responsibility to secure it yourself, which can be quite hard.

In CT (Mimblewimble uses the same basic construct) you give the auditor a "scanning key" which effectively allows him to replay the transaction, except this time being able to read the amounts (unlike network nodes that can only verify the totals of inputs = outputs + fees using homomorphic commitments, not the individual amounts).
In MW there may be some significant differences due to the transactions being aggregated together in a block, but I don't have a good enough grasp to say how it'll change.
The basic idea is clear enough though: you are able to voluntarily allow others to verify the amounts in your transactions.

Another (quite likely imo) possibility: publishing a hash as a commitment, e.g. sha256("I already know such-and-such secret|54u934582353").
Then later he can open it and prove he knew it, or prove he stated it or similar. These kind of things are useful for protocols, but I guess it's a rare situation where it's useful in real life, so to speak.
I noticed some Tor people doing this kind of thing recently (although whether it was useful in those cases or just "because crypto" I can't say, I don't remember anyway).

It's not correct; that would require counterparty risk, since an IOU from your counterparty is not the same as actual settlement of cash. With Lightning, you have a cryptographic guarantee that you can retrieve the funds if the counterparty reneges.

A point that is often missed is that the size of CT transactions does depend quite strongly on the range of amounts you're allowing, it's not a fixed size. The oft-quoted 2.5kB per output is for a range of 0-42btc in satoshi granularity, roughly speaking. It would be smaller for smaller ranges. But compacting it down a lot, so that it's comparable with current transaction sizes, is a bit of a holy grail (there was also a "Compact Confidential Transactions" proposal at one point, but I seem to remember that it had some problems).

I prefer to express it very differently: Bitcoin takes the control over money creation from (central) banks and gives it to no one at all.

That difference is what really counts in my view.

Read the introduction to the whitepaper. It was never intended to be a full-featured consumer payment protocol; it's a digital cash protocol. You can build consumer layers on top of it if you like, but without irreversibility at the base layer, it could never work independently from government sanctioned/controlled systems.
Cash *is* settlement, because it's not contingent, not dependent on anything. Once it's transferred, it's transferred. You'll also hear the term "bearer instrument", which has the same meaning (imagine a certificate where there is no field for "owner" - the holder has complete ownership).
This has caused endless confusion to people who don't think carefully about it. All previous internet payment systems were not cash in any sense (although a few here and there have tried to effect irreversibility; generally they have failed). And that meant that you could work with a different trust model - make a payment if you're not too sure about the contract, but feel like you can "fall back" on your payment provider to deal with the problems if there's a dispute. That works well for most consumers, albeit someone has to pay for all the infrastructure. Also, it's far less ideal for the merchant, who has to deal with the threat of chargebacks (probably a lot more scammers take the consumer role than the merchant role).
Most consumers don't really want *cash* payment to distrusted entities over the internet (even if they *think* they want it, very often they actually don't). Of course sometimes trust isn't much of an issue in that sense (think very large companies). And in other cases, consumers in disadvantaged positions (think: a consumer in Nigeria for example) might not have options to use high quality trusted payment providers, so cash can be a fallback.

That's true, but people tend to derive a wrong conclusion from it; in the purest coinjoin, imagine two participants A and B both having 1BTC, and spend (inputs:(inA, inB), outputs: (1BTC address1, 1BTC address2)), no one can know which of address1 and address2 belong to A or B; that's not a matter of sophistication, it's fundamental. What you still get of course is metadata: other transactions, timing analysis, network level etc. There's a ton to say but the meme has become "all transaction history can be untangled with sufficient cleverness" and that's kind of mostly wrong.


Coinshuffle posits an existing message channel; I don't know what Mycelium currently plans; I have a vague memory that the communication was going to be over Mycelium servers. A centralized server for messaging in any coinjoin impl. is not too much of an issue, it's mostly an issue due to the possibility of censorship or DOS (preventing people taking part), and that isn't a huge issue and can be ameliorated pretty easily. A centralized server snooping of course would be a bad thing but messages can be easily e2e encrypted.

The key insight of our dear Voldemort is that the blinding factors can be re-purposed as an authentication mechanism (like we currently have digital signatures based on knowledge of private keys). In CT, the blinding factors 
(see: hiding and binding, the key properties of a commitment scheme, the 'hiding' property is achieved by attaching a random number to what you commit to, often called a 'blinding factor'. In the Pedersen commitments of CT, the idea is that the totals add up even though the amounts are hidden, ie the sum of all the input and output commitments is zero; to achieve that, the whole set of blinding factors have to add up to zero just as the amounts do)
... are secret to the (sender, receiver), and the network only needs to know that their sum is zero. In MW you add a tweak - restrict knowledge of the receiver's blinding factors to the receiver only, by allowing him to have the total set of blinding factors *not* add up to zero, but rather add up to some non-zero amount, call it k, then that k is something like a private key - he can sign with its public key kG. It doesn't matter what he signs - can be an empty string. Nobody else can attach that signature, nobody else knows k, only kG (and others do know kG, 'cos its the arithmetic difference of the commitments). It's pretty genius actually.

You're wrong. The concept "brainwallets are bad/terrible" is based on the concept of a *user generated brainwallet*. Mnemonic seed phrases generated by the wallet do not have that problem (e.g. dictionary 1600-2000 words, phrase length 12-24 words, entropy 128-256 bits). They can be memorized for situations where that's needed, and written down easily to take advantage of analogue storage methods.

Except it doesn't solve the problem of infinitely growing txo set size. So presumably you will jump to a new coin when someone finds a new design for that? They will have just as convincing arguments why you have to switch to that coin and not continue using/working on Monero ("fundamentally broken design" they will say, "pathetic scalability" etc etc), so I presume at that point you will abandon Monero and move to the new shiny coin?

Yes, I've been thinking about this a little. Interactivity is *really* bad for usability of crypto systems, so I largely agree with you; on the other hand, existing coinjoin systems rely on interactivity of some sort or other - either via a central server (see sharedcoin, darkwallet) or less-central-y but involving a lot of interaction over a message channel (see joinmarket). So one could argue that an extra interaction step is not such a big deal here.
Coinshuffle is a protocol that can enhance coinjoin, and again: it requires another bunch of interaction.
The extra interactivity here (for nonce commitment) feels intuitively like the inevitable cost of the effectively infinite compactifying achieved by overlaying all the signatures. But tbh intuition ain't worth that much here :)

It's not principles from Bitcoin (OK, that's partly my opinion; I don't really think "blockchain" is the important thing for them, even though it's their favourite buzzword); it's just cryptography that was well understood 10,20 years ago but they couldn't be bothered to use it. Lack of any actual market pressure in financial services may have something to do with it, but there is also general societal inertia, which it's easy to underestimate.

That's the point of the lightning network - you don't need to wait for confirmations when doing a spend - it's just a matter of receiving an updated form of the transaction. Both sides can be confident of their new balance immediately.
You still need to wait for confirmations when opening/closing a channel. I have a vague memory that for those transactions, you might need to wait longer than usual? But I defer to someone who knows more about it.

According to the OP they do? 


It'd be interesting to find out exactly what kind of signature algo they're using ... it seems a bit weird to be using a shared key (DH perhaps?) for signing, but in any case it'd be interesting to know exactly what algos they're using. I opened the SCI document on their page and from a brief flip through, I did notice use of MD5 hashes, which is a bit unfortunate ... not sure if that'd be a vector though.
Edit: ah, on a second quick read through, I'm getting the impression that there is no digital signing going on, only hashing of some data fields (some of which are intended to be secret), something like that. If so, it becomes more and more unsurprising I guess.

The reason it's performing that function better is because it can be transferred without permission. You could create a gold/usd, gold/cny exchange but since withdrawals of gold would be subject to government laws (as well as extremely expensive and slow), it would not create a similar scenario.

What you are talking about is utxos. Utxos are perfectly distinguishable, but coins are not (as you say; they don't actually exist). Bitcoin transactions are multi-input multi-output, so the source of coins in output1 cannot be attributed to any specific subset of the input utxos.
Note how if bitcoin only allowed single input transactions, this distinction would be irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-04-03 06:08:41
Surprised people not discussing shorting (except one guy mentioned the mechanism).
You go to an exchange where they allow it, and you deposit 1 bazillion dollars. You open as many short positions as you feel like - what that means is, you borrow bitcoins from other participants at the exchange who have a positive position in bitcoin sitting in their account. For that, you pay them small, regular fees in interest.
Having borrowed the bitcoins from other people on the exchange, you can then sell them directly in the open market.
Now, the terms of your contract for borrowing usually include paying the bitcoins back at a later date, e.g. after a week or a month. But that's no problem; you simply "roll" the contract, i.e. start up a new one that carries on where the first one left off. That way, you can be permanently short a big chunk of bitcoin that you never actually owned; the only cost is the interest (often referred to as the "carry").
Notice how this is all voluntary and all sides get what they want: the holders of bitcoin that choose to do this get a passive interest rate on their held bitcoins (note - they may not be correctly assessing their counterparty risk, but - were they doing so before, if they were holding bitcoins on an exchange!?), the exchange, if it sets fees appropriate to risk, will love anything that means more volume and business, while you, the shorter, get to express your negative opinion on Bitcoin to your heart's content.
The deep pocketed bear therefore can "suppress" the price of Bitcoin with large negative bets, without ever first buying Bitcoin. But it isn't so simple - if offers to loan dry up, then interest rates skyrocket for him, which will be at least annoying. Moreover, large short positions imply large losses in case of a moonshot.
However I'm of the opinion that a big part of the reduction in volatility seen over the last 2 years has had the ability to short as a contributory factor. It probably acts as a dampener, and conspiracy theories aside, that might be a good thing.

If I'm reading you right, then I think we agree on that point: brain wallet only (and only the secure form) is appropriate only where there is a high risk of confiscation. But remember that "brain wallet only" can be localized, i.e. on travels I only use the brainwallet, doesn't mean I don't have physical analog storage of the secret elsewhere (of course this redundancy capability isn't only for brainwallets, but I'm just saying that isn't introduced as a new problem by choosing not to carry a wallet in physical form).

Good notes. One extra hint to add: be on  on freenode :) That's where I got the 432 info for example.
One other minor point I was initially unclear about is that the new tx serialization applies to any transaction with at least 1 segwit input (with the non-segwit having witnesses encoded as a single zero byte in the witness portion), but if *no* inputs are segwit then the tx serialization reverts to the old form (so no marker, flag byte etc).
Re the final point, I wonder if it might take a while (even after address formats are finalized) before one can use the raw witness type addresses, since all the wallets out there only know about p2sh today (well that's changing, but still).

And in the analogy - plutonium might be at the heart of a large industrial system that delivers heat to your house, instead. Is nuclear power a failure? Highly debatable - it's used for ~20% of electricity base load generation in some countries, and more in a few - it just isn't the amazing world-changing phenomenon it was expected to be in the 1950s.
The existence of Lightning-type tech has changed *my* view a bit - I used to think the only realistic scenario, for everyday users actually doing in-real-life transactions, was some kind of trust-based model. Coinbase, changetip, that kind of thing. Now I think it's at least possible that a more-or-less trustless system might be usable, although it seems quite a way out.
If people use bitcoin *directly* I think it'll be mostly for savings (though not all of them!). All these exchange blowups don't mean that there aren't good, usable solutions for that. For retail payments, well to be fair it does work now, at the low level of volume we have for semi-expert users, and it's a very reasonable experience. The idea it's going to go into "mainstream adoption" in this *raw* form is just crazy talk, always was.

This is the extra step of thinking most people never get to, it seems to me: the problem with having regulated finance is people come to rely on that instead of common sense or any kind of due diligence. People have been 'trained' or conditioned to take *zero* responsibility for their own (financial) safety. Then, they complain that they have no freedom. Then, they discover Bitcoin and demand that it gives them total freedom with no responsibility.
Then, they lose all their money to scammers :)

Not disagreeing except that you miss a vital point: even with all the extra privacy-enhancing features, openness/transparency is still an option.
This is even explicitly enabled in Confidential Transactions via the optional sharing of a scanning key which can enable an auditor for example to read the amounts transferred in the transaction, while still keeping it private to the outside world.

Yes, two distinct (but connected) concepts: the "bidirectional payment channel" and the "HTLC" - the latter allows you to route over multiple hops. Without that routing capability you couldn't call Lightning a "network" and it would be far less interesting (well, it'd just be bidirectional payment channels, which are only marginally more interesting than unidirectional payment channels which ... are still quite interesting :) ).

Govts may, in theory, do any crazy thing.
If a person is allowed to send their coins from their own Core node + wallet to another person's Core node + wallet, how is it any different if it's done over lightning, over multiple hops? It's no different whatsoever.
Govts may decide they want to shut down all or any part of this whole system at any time, we'll see. Don't forget a large part of Bitcoin's design is to resist precisely that attack.
"Ability to transact on chain is a must", don't see anything to discuss there, of course Lightning can't work without that, because by definition it's Bitcoin. However interpreting that as to mean "cheap infinite txs 4eva gigablocks" is stupid because that doesn't work at all (it collapses to shitty Paypal).
@_date: 2016-04-21 06:28:26
No, neither the purists nor pretty much anyone else here tells anyone to hold any meaningful amount of coins on your day to day PC, internet connected. We tell people the opposite. Any of the various forms of "cold storage" is the right way to do it (counting hardware wallets as one type of that).
I understand the perspective of "I'm not techie enough/I don't have the patience" and then using something like Coinbase instead, just as long as it's understood that it's basically a bank model and they have control over your funds in that case. Too many people come here whining about that.

I'm not sure, but I get the impression that that's the intention. It's a bit like blockchain.info's sharedcoin implementation in that respect, except at one point at least (not sure if it changed), that implementation had a broken design (see: "Coinjoin sudoku"). So assuming they didn't make a similar error, they could create a similar system and get liquidity within the set of Mycelium users. From my discussions with some people though I don't think they like the "market" idea, so it might be more of a "flat" model, the kind of "wait in a lobby" approach.

(1) An hour is only somewhat unusual
(2) 10000 satoshis is somewhat too small for a "typical" transaction size of ~ 500 bytes, but it depends on the size (it's assessed per kilobyte). This site gives good up to date info generally: 
@_date: 2016-04-29 10:42:09


It's not moved into OP_RETURN, it's moved into a new "txinwitness" field (serialized at the end of the transaction). Although for "segwit nested in p2sh" which is how it'll first be deployed it's a little more complicated than that, but anyway.
Also, there is not a 75% reduction in cost, it's that witness data is "counted" at 75% smaller impact for the overall transaction size when measuring against a fee estimate cost per byte. So the "vsize" field of the transaction becomes (non-witness data) + (witness data)*0.25. So for example if the witness data (which is where the signatures go, the largest fields in current transactions) is 500 bytes and the non-witness part is 500 bytes, you use a transaction "size" of 625 bytes instead of 1kB. The benefits will get larger as the number of inputs to the transaction gets larger, and it depends on the specific type.

The jury is still out on that one. Some people think the insolvency started in the 2011 debacle, but that's a bit far out; others say the problems started in early 2013, and this vid is late 2013 iirc. Nobody who was paying attention was trusting MtGox with btc at that point, which just added to the video's weirdness/ill-conceivedness.

Utterly false. The very concept was created in the 1970s; and it is an attack on the money-ness of government currency. It is a reckless destruction of civil liberties that are arguably as important as free speech. There has to be such a thing as a non-revocable payment, and that requires an unencumbered ownership of money, for if there isn't no one can ever actually own money which cripples *serious* business. The question is what you embed that non-revocable layer into. With the current system only realistically, banks and ultimately central banks have access to that layer (even SWIFT is somewhat reversible) electronically, for ordinary people they have access to that via cash; and governments are aggressively trying to remove it (it's already been crippled with size limits). But I believe they will fail, people *will* have access to real cash, at least digitally, maybe even physically too.


Don't listen to all the shitcoiners, ICOs and worst of all the corporate "private blockchain" drivel; the very concept of a "blockchain" (a ludicrously inefficient design) only exists to enable survival against large-scale state-actor sponsored attack. See: egold, I am being literal.
People try to twist the definition so that it can work in a controlled setting; that's not "blockchain", it's basic cryptography applied to distributed databases, tech that's been around 30-40 years and should probably already have been in use at least 10-15 years ago.


That's the fundamental problem, people *can't* take their pick, in the existing framework. Those of us (like me) who have no need for government to tell us what we can invest in, never wanted external control over our money, but never had any choice. Now to a limited extent we do, with Bitcoin, which is why we spend our time on it.

There was a good video about the implementation in one of the recent CCC conferences (2014?). They made some pretty bad errors at one point, which made for some good laughs in the video ... but it may well have improved. The system is based on a central server as I recall (as, quite likely, it has to be), but perhaps more to the point there are a bunch of very strange requirements for cryptographic voting that make "oh let's vote on the blockchain" look dubious. There's a bunch of literature about crypto voting, which I haven't read, all I know is it's not simple!

I find it *much* more likely a mistake than a deliberate deceit. But the former is still quite revealing to me; it suggests to me that he doesn't work directly with Bitcoin very much. Us peasants who actually code and/or work with bitcoin transactions regularly, rather than being visionary heroes, know full well what to look for when a transaction is stuck, and more importantly, how to avoid it.

The IP address logs are not public, presumably? Although Tor for example would go some way to address that.

Be a bit careful! I'd say even when software versions move to beta or even "production", there's still a good reason to treat Lightning as something you put *smallish* amounts of money in at any one time. (The current max channel size is 0.16btc and I think that makes a lot of sense).

This is an excessive claim; if what it really means is "in the scenario, unlikely but possible, that a customer's funds are stolen during the trade process, we will eat the loss", that's fine, but it should be stated in that way, because it shows that there *is* counterparty risk. Of course it's not the same kind of counterparty risk as companies that hold funds long term, but it's not "zero risk by design" or similar marketing speak that misleads customers into thinking that something magical protects their money.

Lol, it doesn't matter what it says on wikipedia (that article probably contains all kinds of drivel from bcash, ahem, "advocates"). The signatures are serialized in the witness section, between the outputs and the locktime.

You connect to anyone. Realistically you'd keep a few channels open to ensure good connectivity to the whole network. And yes, you pay fees per hop.

What part of this is any different for bitcoin nodes? It's strictly better due to the encryption and onion routing features built-in. Bitcoin transactions *must* be broadcast, although there's plenty one can do to obfuscate the source (Tor nodes, Dandelion). Lightning transactions don't have to be broadcast, and won't be.


That doesn't make any sense at all. Just because the network's big doesn't force me to open large capacity channels, or a large number of them.

Batching is not the opposite of consolidation; the opposite of consolidation would be to take a small number of utxos and create a large number. You can consolidate while batching (pay to N counterparties, while consolidating M inputs into only 1 new change utxo).

Stupidly I'd never thought about this obvious point.

What I was referring to above (witness percentage) is the third graph on segwit.party . I'd say it's the most important in the specific sense that it's only increases on that metric that allow for larger blocks, but for sure it is not totally clear what one metric is in some absolute sense "the most important for measuring "transaction" throughput", mainly because it's slightly unclear what a "transaction" is in Bitcoin; a batched transaction can represent transfers between hundreds of people (even more so a coinjoin, although such large coinjoins are extremely rare so not really too relevant).

I disagree; p2sh wrapped segwit scriptPubKeys were explicitly for backwards compatibility to avoid this problem, and were advertised (imv, correctly) as one of the key advantages of the upgrade. Demanding immediate upgrades from everyone is against the spirit of a soft fork.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:13:50
Basically, the 'native' segwit address types (p2wpkh and p2wsh) have a new scriptPubkey type, (witness version)(key/script hash), and have an empty scriptSig, moving that data (signature and pubkey in case of p2wpkh) into the witness section. With "p2sh wrap" (so, p2sh/p2wpkh and p2sh/p2wsh) you use the existing mechanism of p2sh, where the actual scriptpubkey is only revealed as a 'redeem script' when spending, so that part still has to go into the scriptSig, and you still provide the (sig, pub) (for p2wpkh) in the witness. The difference therefore is (a) p2sh wrap uses up an extra chunk (20 or so bytes) in the scriptSig, which is not discounted (not in witness), and (b) it's backwards compatible for senders to your wallet (they dont need to know anything about segwit).
See the section "Examples" in BIP141 for a clearer/more detailed expl.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:51:23


Yes and no, but mostly no. Around the time of those large blocks, the percentage of the block taken up by witness spiked from 10% to 20% ish, even though the number of transactions using segwit stayed around 10%. Given things like batching and consolidation, "number of transactions" isn't a particularly useful measure of real throughput. It may be better to switch to number of inputs consumed/number of outputs created, but to be honest it isn't that obvious; what *is* clear is that "number of transactions per unit time" doesn't fully capture what's going on.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:53:29


It's more like 3.7MB. In theory a block which contained *only* witness data can be 4MB, but it's not possible to create transactions without any non-witness data, so the real limit is less than 4MB (although presumably it's bigger than 3.7, I don't know the exact theoretical maximum).
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:11:12
It's actually the irreversibility property that's the most important here.
As has often been observed, calling Bitcoin 'anonymous' is very wrong, although it is pseudonymous. It doesn't have good privacy properties by default.
But txs being irreversible, combined with *enough* privacy if various measures are taken, make it very attractive for thieves. In this way it's like physical cash (less anonymous, but more convenient in other ways).

We already have a 2MB (approx) max block size. For some reason, companies are refusing to implement segwit, which would allow people to use that space. My wallet was upgraded to segwit on the day of activation. Testing was available for segwit a year earlier.
I get the impression people don't realize, segwit "saves 30% of fees" misses the point quite badly, the point is that the more people use it, the more space there is for *all* transactions. It's very super-linear in that regard. I think if adoption were even just at 30-40% say (as opposed to the current anemic 10%), fees would fall off very drastically, for everyone. Let alone if it were near 100% (in which case we'd have the aforementioned ~2MB max block size).
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:48:34


I'm starting to think this is some kind of elaborate joke. Multiple people in this comment thread talking about "the 1mb limit" which doesn't exist.
So, the *effective* max blocksize is no longer 1MB. It's near to 2MB.
In fact, you'll struggle to find a block that isn't bigger than 1MB nowadays.
If you want bigger blocks, complain to companies like Coinbase, Bitpay, they are directly preventing them (just as miners did for about a year).
Oh, and in case your response is "I was talking about base block size", that's drivel being spouted by some trolls. There is no "base block size", the only limit is block *weight*, at 4 million. With 0 segwit transactions this corresponds to a 1MB block size, with *all* segwit transactions and transaction mix similar to today, it corresponds to about 2MB, with our current (low!) 10%-ish of segwit transactions, we're getting around 1.1MB. Hence the above about companies adopting it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:42:43


Please tell me you're kidding. You still don't know that there is no 1MB limit any more?
Assuming you're not kidding, to repeat from other convo:
The max block size is now ~ 2MB. We regularly have blocks in the 1.2-1.5MB range already, just it's fairly rare. The only thing preventing larger blocks is people not using segwit. It's mindblowing that years on people still are completely blind to the actual facts - we already doubled the block size and companies like Coinbase, Bitpay refuse to implement an upgrade **that was in testing 2 years ago**, that would allow us to use that larger block size.

30-50% reduction off the bat, plus a likely (near-inevitable) fee market collapse if everyone were to use it now.
That collapse would be temporary *assuming* demand for block space goes back up again, of course.
But "won't significantly reduce fees" is clearly completely false, over the near term.


Yes that's true for sure, but it doesn't support the obviously false claim "segwit won't significantly reduce fees".

Only addressing one small part of this, but: there is no need to be carrying any wallet or other btc-related data, encrypted or not, on your person when you cross a border. Have a bitcoin node with an empty wallet if you're a bitcoin geek like me, but mostly more sensible is if you run the node somewhere and access it remotely over your phone (e.g. greenbits or some other wallets).
I have some small amount on my phone when I'm crossing borders. If they want to be Nazis they can have it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:32:57
Yes, I think unidirectional should work OK without segwit, if you use OP_CLTV for the refund clause.
But the bidirectional channels (sometimes known as "Poon-Dryja channels") require segwit to work, because you need to be able to set up dependent chains of transactions (before any are confirmed on chain), and dependencies are invalidated if the initiating transaction is malleated before being confirmed.
AFAIR it is still possible to make it work without segwit's malleability fix, but it's both hacky and seriously hampered in functionality (perhaps someone else can lay out the exact details that I don't recall, but it seems ~ irrelevant considering that it's just obvious that malleability is a serious bug that has to be fixed to make contracting work in a sensible way).
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:03:40
Throughput is what matters. The backlog would clear in a day or two in that scenario, and from then on, unless the throughput remains consistently double what it is now, fees would collapse.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:58:08


The block size goes up to ~ 2MB if people adopt segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:25:45
I always loved this imagery (I think it first got used ~ 2013), because Bitcoin was a perfect example of a 'black swan'; nobody analysing the problems of the financial system around 2008 could possibly have guessed that this would come out of the crisis. So unlike entirely foreseeable disasters which are often called 'black swans' erroneously, this I think fits the bill.
But calling Bitcoin 'antifragile' (another idea championed by Taleb) is I think mostly wrong. Bitcoin's design is entirely centered around robustness, but antifragility is another matter. You can claim it has it, but it's handwaving.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:56:43






Not at all. If companies adopted segwit, *all* transactions would have lower fees (probably dramatically), because more space would be available for *all* transactions, segwit or not.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:49:59
That's exactly my point; the property you describe is robustness against attack. Arguing that attacks necessarily lead to greater strength than before is dubious; at least it needs considerable justification.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:06:27
Blockstream are basically a set of mostly ridiculously smart people, who are a convenient target for attack.
Those of us who were here before it existed know that those people were great contributors to Bitcoin before (well, a few new people as well), and obviously had good intentions. So yes it's a bunch of quite crazy nonsense.
Fwiw I'd prefer it if there was a broader spread of companies with similar commitment to Bitcoin. We do have chaincode labs that employs several Core devs, too. And there are others.
But don't over-emphasize their importance either. It's not like the majority of commits on Bitcoin are coming from them; their influence is not *that* overwhelming.
Bitcoin is an open source software project and anyone can contribute (although the bar for inclusion of code is *very* high as it inevitably has to be).

It's not a thankless task; at worst, it's a minor inconvenience. What you get mostly from running your own node is good privacy in interacting with the blockchain (especially if you use Tor), e.g. in broadcasting your transactions. You also have an extra layer of security, since you see the real up-to-date version of the blockchain that you have directly verified is valid. Other setups can't quite give you that. Note you can combine a node with a different wallet (I use Joinmarket, because I work on it, but there are convenient ways, e.g. connecting a mobile wallet to your own Core node). And although I don't use the GUI, the Core wallet has a lot of additional advanced features that can be very useful for more expert users.

The max block size is now ~ 2MB. We regularly have blocks in the 1.2-1.5MB range already, just it's fairly rare. The only thing preventing larger blocks is people not using segwit. It's mindblowing that years on people still are completely blind to the actual facts - we already doubled the block size and companies like Coinbase, Bitpay refuse to implement an upgrade **that was in testing 2 years ago**, that would allow us to use that larger block size.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:44:01
Yes for sure. Is Bitcoin stronger *because* it was attacked? If you say yes, I think you could claim a bank is antifragile when, after a cyberattack on its IT systems, it beefs up security measures. This seems to water down the concept an awful lot.
Otoh, the decentralization for sure does give extra robustness, no CPOF. Antifragility? Im just unconvinced. Maybe need to think about it more.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:00:52
I presume that site is measuring segwit *spends*, i.e. a transaction is "segwit" if at least one of the inputs is redeeming a segwit scriptPubKey (so there will be a "witness" section in the transaction).

If it's really third after "securing customer funds" and "making sure our website actually operates", then I can't hate on that so much (although I never really trusted them, completely wrong-headed imo, never been a customer and never will).
It should honestly be treated as an emergency today (by all processors of large numbers of transactions). Possibly batching withdrawals should even come first, depending on what they're doing today (I don't know).
If they did that, fees would collapse, at least for a while. Then try to implement L2 stuff.

That was a valid point up to around June 2017 (which is the time when I actually decided to write and push the code); at that point there was no doubt activation was going to happen by September.
Which means they've had 6 months (as well as a huge amount of time to familiarize, before that).
Some people (better software engineers than I!) were able to make the upgrade in a matter of days. For a very large org there are more considerations, it's true, but this is very obviously not a matter of engineering/tech, it's a matter of politics and stubbornness.

Full nodes don't have identity. They are easy to spoof (one person could run 100 'nodes' that don't even store the blockchain let alone verify it).
@_date: 2015-12-05 16:45:32
The answer depends pretty strongly on whether it's important to you to get into the next block.
This site gives a useful picture if you don't have a node: 
Notice the big difference between 'next 12 min' and 'next 20 min'.
Many wallets, in their most recent updates, will be making a good stab at estimating for you (e.g. Electrum, which I use, but certainly others too).
One thing, I'd strongly recommend never setting it as low as 0.00005, I think a lot of nodes (like mine!) have a policy not to relay anything that low, although it'll vary.
@_date: 2015-12-03 10:15:50


But if low latency becomes critical, won't that lead to geographic or similar network level centralization? Just having cheap bandwidth yourself doesn't seem to be the edge.
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:18:49


I don't like this phrasing; it's not that someone's going to judge a transaction as spam. It's that *if* transactions are free, there for sure will be someone out there that will fill the Bitcoin blockchain with "transactions" that are actually junk, or filled with movies and music. Having transactions be free on a ledger that *everyone keeps a copy of* is obviously unviable.
That transactions were more or less free on day 1 is just because nobody was bothering to attack Bitcoin. We are past that now.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:37:24


Just as well because the max blocksize is no longer 1MB. It's near to 2MB.
In fact, you'll struggle to find a block that *isn't* bigger than 1MB nowadays.
If you want bigger blocks, complain to companies like Coinbase, Bitpay, they are directly preventing them (just as miners did for about a year).

Sounds stupid but Matonis (used to be interesting but now a fake-Satoshi shill) actually criticized Schnorr for being "unproven tech" or something, despite the fact it has a security reduction to ECDL (~= a "proof of its security", with assumptions of course), whereas ECDSA doesn't. And ECDSA is basically kind of botched up Schnorr to get around Schnorr's patent on Schnorr signatures.

For any given 256 bit hash, the chance of it being an x coord in the secp256k1 group is about 1/2. So in Bitcoin CT, hash256(G) was not guaranteed to work either, but major caveat: it of course depends on exactly how you encode G before passing it to sha256; they used DER encoding, but not compression: 
I just briefly looked at the mininero code linked from the paper, it looks like you take the hash output and pass it into decodepoint, and it treats it as the y-value and then derives the x value ... not that it matters, just wondering for ed25519 what's the probability of getting a point to "work" by random chance this way? Btw the code is still referring to 123456G, but maybe that's a hangover.

My point was that if latency becomes more important, what you describe above might become less true.

I think it'd be a mistake to focus on the $ price impact of a 51% attack; it basically makes the network totally untrustworthy, so even those who use it insensitive to $ price would stop using it. (note I'm talking about a full-on attack, not just having the potential to do it)

On the contrary, the consensus mechanism by which government operates - democratic voting - is clearly understood by the people. The consensus mechanism of Bitcoin is not understood at all by the vast majority. Indeed, many of them seem to analogize it as similar to a democracy, when it is nothing of the sort.

It doesn't seem like a completely uncontroversial question (e.g. debates about OP_RETURN). Surely the core issue is that block space is paid for (either with direct fees or coin value/coin age). I understand that transactions are intended for bitcoin transfer and not other purposes, but it doesn't seem like a simple issue at all. Still, point taken, the term 'spam' is not unambiguously wrong.

I agree there will be no immediate impact on the rest of the periphery (unless there are really severe effects on bond and equity markets, perhaps). The problem is not bank runs (today) - the problem is that *if* the Greeks win the battle (in some way, who knows how) to not have austerity any more, it will create a huge political impetus in these countries which could lead to significant changes in power, and then the possibility of Syriza x 100 (in terms of the size of those economies).
That's why a lot of people are worried that the Eurocrats real goal now is to absolutely crush Greece.

Only backwards-incompatible changes.
I'm a little bit surprised that people are so up in arms about this all of a sudden. Why do you think Satoshi spent two years working on this before even making a single alpha release? The nature of the thing is that it had to be pretty much set in advance. Block reward, for example: there is realistically no way of going back on that.
I don't see it as some unexpected fundamental flaw that hard forks are between hard and impossible. That's the nature of the thing.
@_date: 2015-12-06 13:02:16


We don't have to trust them, not in the same sense you do a bank.
They don't *ultimately* control the system; they could block transactions, but if they do everyone will see it.
Bitcoin is not a system to replace trust in a bank or payment system with trust in a distributed group of miners, it replaces trust with cryptographic verification.
If mining gets too centralized, then the core weakness of the system becomes a concern: the 51% attack. But that attack doesn't steal all your coins. And crucially, it happens *in public*, which has huge implications.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:31:54

@_date: 2015-06-13 07:08:38


I feel like a broken record, but no, this is *fundamentally* false (I mean the "inherently" part). Bitcoin transactions are many-many mappings. 
Even when people are lazy, there is still some ambiguity in the transaction graph. If even a little care is taken (e.g. not reusing addresses) it's a lot better. And it's possible to use coinjoin style transactions to make tracing quite impossible.
Anyone who says Bitcoin is traceable has to explain the countless cases of criminals successfully getting away with heists or exit scams, for example SheepMarket. Where exactly are those Bitcoins? That's right, nobody knows, even though people were trying to track them in real time from the moment it happened.
@_date: 2015-12-20 08:00:37
What's mainly needed is layers above (like Lightning). The exact "correct" configuration of the base layer is obviously an ongoing debate, but I think a successful future for Bitcoin involves, at some point, innovation at that level stopping. Imagine for example hardware with the protocol written into it. Bitcoin itself should ossify and the innovation should move to higher layers (or sideways - sidechains).
@_date: 2015-12-30 08:48:06
This is a good answer, but it is not as clear cut as it might have been 5 years ago.
As a general manufacturing hub, China is still the biggest for sure, but a lot of labour-intensive work is starting to drift away (labour costs have risen massively in the last decade).
The issue more relevant to Bitcoin is how much of the high tech, computer hardware manufacturing is concentrated there. It seems like all of the Bitcoin ASICs came out of China, probably mainly from Guangdong(esp. Shenzhen).
 
I'd love to hear differently, but I got the impression that even the chips which aren't designed in China and owned by Chinese, were *fabricated* in China in any case.

It's a bit of both. However, it is simply a fact that savings held in euros over the past 12 months have lost a big chunk of purchasing power, if averaged globally.

Oh, I totally buy that aspect of the argument.

Bear Stearns *was* bailed out - see Maiden Lane. The fact that the company was actually sold is not the point - the bad assets were 'tidied away' as a result of a multibillion dollar loan from the Fed.
You're living in cloud cuckoo land if you don't think there was any implicit government backstop for financial institutions before 2008. Ever heard of the "Greenspan put"? Do you know the term "GSE"? Implicit government backstop of large financial institutions traces way back to the creation of the Federal Reserve in the US. It was the explicit reason for its creation.
The shock event was of course Lehman, where for once they *didn't* bail out - only to change their mind within a week or two and bail out *everybody* who was about to collapse as a result of that shock.


So it does have *something* to do with it. And what you say there is in agreement with what I said.

It seems to me you could operate a coin on a consortium of a large number of banks internationally, a bit like SWIFT, ~~so you're in proper Byzantine Generals territory, and you could use PoW but limited to those fixed players.~~
Edit: No, I forgot again - with fixed identities you can just  use signatures, no need for PoW mining.
Bottom line is when you have identities you have a very different kind of system - it can be fast and efficient but it can never be censorship resistant (at least, not fully).
@_date: 2015-12-06 14:53:23
To the large miners, it's a revenue stream. The fact that they need such high capital expenditure to set up their mining enforces that.
Satoshi addressed this point in the whitepaper. His argument was not watertight, which I'm sure he was perfectly aware of; but the case is worth serious consideration (they get more from honestly mining if they have large hashpower, than from deliberately destroying the network).
The ability to short BTC instruments is one potential weakness in this argument. Another is non-economic actors. The system is certainly not impervious to attack, but personally I think it's the best alignment of incentives currently known.

This is why "moral hazard" is such an important part of the story. It's not the *fact* of bail outs that matters nearly as much as the *implicit guarantee* of a backstop. It was in the Fannie/Freddie Mac case that that discussion was had most publically, but it applied to some degree across the board. AIG FP's flagrant misuse of AIG's status as an insurer was much more insidious but maybe more significant. And perhaps the worst of all was the corruption of the ratings agencies. Notice that both of those last two aspects were entirely dependent on regulation - because it was *mandated* for many institutional investors to respect ratings only by regulated ratings agencies, those agencies became corrupt and started basing their ratings on ludicrous nonsense (and anyone who complained got the boot). This kind of regulation is absolute poison to a functioning market. And yet, the peanut gallery (I notice, especially in Europe) actually think "the financial crisis was caused by a lack of regulation".
The decision to follow the herd into risky assets like MBS etc was sound business logic under those conditions: what you lost from not playing along was immediate and pressing; what you gained by being cautious was of little interest to anyone, since no one in the executive class of the financial industry stood to lose *that* much. For many it was a stark choice between "don't lever up and get fired now for underperforming your peers, or jump in and face a possible firing much later, after having made a ton of money". Difficult choice! Levering up and getting bigger was the optimal strategy. Because of the backstop.
As for Bitcoin, well it's all a bit pie in the sky, and I agree it doesn't address everything. The concept is clear though: take the printing press out of anyone's hands.

Yes, such an attack would have to be extremely stealthy to have a chance of achieving something meaningful. Not only would you have to make sure that word didn't get out that you were doing it in the first place (good luck with that!), but you would be very limited in how many and what kinds of transactions you could censor. Even one per block, if it was a meaningful financial transaction, would certainly be enough for people to notice it happening. 
What's more, the argument that if a transaction were "illegal" then the originator would not complain, is weak to useless, since people can use anonymity tools - all the victim needs to do is to point out, anonymously, the existence of the unconfirmed tx in the p2p network and the failure of its confirmation. The whole thing doesn't really make much sense when you analyze it, precisely because bitcoin is based on public verification.
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:12:12

It's just applying hash functions, merkle trees (usually) and digital sigs to distribute a database right. It's not even as if the 'block' part of blockchain will really matter in many of these implementations; they're going to use signatures-from-identities in place of proof of work, and latency will be minimal since it won't be an open p2p network of computers. So in some applications there may be little or no need for blocks.
It really shouldn't be called 'blockchain', it's just updating back end systems to use the crypto primitives they should have started using about 15 years ago.
Notice that Google set up 'certificate transparency' a year or two back, which is much closer to what could be called a blockchain, and a design that makes a lot of sense, but they didn't feel the need to pretend it was the same as Bitcoin and call it a "blockchain".

Even 1% can be quite economically significant if miners operate on thin margins, which seems highly likely in a competitive market.

It makes a difference. At the heart of the problem outlined in that book is the concept of "moral hazard", which only exists because the central bank has an unlimited source of funds.

It's interesting that in the financial bust in Japan in the early 90s, they were roundly criticised by western commentators for "zombie banks" and failure to let free market forces do their thing. Turns out the US is certainly no better, nor Europe for that matter. Zombies all round.

Yes I know, I tried to be clear that I wasn't making the argument of n=u, just mentioning it as a kind of context.


Yeah I saw that in your other post. Or edited one, whatever.  OK. We start with O(nt) for the whole network, then divide by n for each node, so we have O(t) for the workload for any given node. Then it all comes back to the question of whether t scales linearly, quadratically or something else with u, the number of users. I think it entirely depends on the payments "topology"/graph.
 If you think as Bitcoin as bootstrapping ex-nihilo new economic activity, and payments are all peer to peer with no centralization, then the whole Metcalfe thing makes sense, and we have the idea t ~ u^2 . 
Whether it's new economic activity or existing probably doesn't affect it. If payments have a "flat" topology, then every additional user added is going to add  ~ *k*u new payments (filling in that many edges on the graph), so you'd still get a quadratic scaling. But if the topology is not flat, by which I mean, there are hubs and spokes in payments, then in the extreme, where every user pays and is paid by one central entity, then each additional user will add only ~ *k* payments, so we have a linear scaling.
I'm sure one could go a lot further down this rabbit hole, but I bet it ends up being t ~ u^k where k is some weird number between 1 and 2. And then k probably varies with t anyway :) Economics is not physics, unfortunately.

I mean that, blocks orphaned day to day is a normal part of Bitcoin operation; eventually the network converges on one chain, because everyone agrees on which blocks are valid.
Whereas in a hard fork, that convergence doesn't happen, because one subset of the network has a different set of consensus to rule to the complementary set, so the fork persists permanently (well, until one subset gives up and agrees with the other - which in a contentious situation could last a long time).

That's my point, it's not the same. If someone doesn't like some aspect of Linux (including the kernel), they can run a modified form and still go about their business, including talking to other people over the network - because it's only at the network level they need to be running the same protocols. There are millions of different Linux instances running by now; and while we can all run different wallets, bitcoin nodes all have to agree on the same ruleset to interoperate. Writing a new bitcoin node implementation is insanely hard, because it has to be bug-for-bug compatible with Bitcoin Core.

You're fundamentally wrong (I mean fundamentally in the literal sense, not the emphasis sense). You're also partly wrong in practice, and I think the trend is more in that direction.
Bitcoin transactions are many-many mappings. Here is one such, from a couple of days back:
You cannot *even in principle* tell me which of the inputs was responsible for one particular of the 0.39 outputs. That's part of the design: there is no particular satoshi that is directed to the first output and a different one to the second output.
This one was created with JoinMarket, but they can be created all kinds of ways. Sometimes you might see a transaction with several inputs and 2 or 3 identical outputs, and it might be entirely controlled by one person, or it might not. You can't tell.
A curious point of history: about the only thing in the original Bitcoin whitepaper which seems to be a flat out mistake is this:


transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.
(from the section on 'Privacy'). This is, fundamentally again, false. The owner of the privkey corresponding to each input can sign the transaction separately, handing over their signature to someone else. That's what Joinmarket and all the other implementations of CoinJoin do. See the original CoinJoin post on btctalk for more theory and practice.
Why did I say "you're also partly wrong in practice"? Because of the huge amount of bitcoin that has been stolen over the years from dark markets and exchanges, which people have not been able to track successfully. SheepMarket was a particularly interesting public example. To people who know what they're doing, Bitcoin is very fungible.

It's certainly a reasonable thing to try, but there is huge diversity in wallets generally, and although Core tends to be used for "industrial" Bitcoin use-cases (certainly including miners), I'm not sure how many big Bitcoin holders are using Core directly as their wallet/RNG. But again, this is a meaningful kind of attack if it could be pulled off.
If you're going to try it for signature nonces, that *seems* impossible... we have RFC6979 now. People are not just throwing any old crap in there ... any more ... hopefully :)
And they're not using DUAL_ECDRBG for private keys, either :) Perhaps you can backdoor the hardware to screw up random generators like /dev/urandom? Seems a little out there, but who knows.

People always seem to go to extremes.
This is, in my opinion, a reasonably internally consistent positions to hold:
* Only a proof of work based blockchain is truly decentralised; and it can only function by providing an incentive to participants. That incentive has to be internal to the system otherwise you lose the decentralization. Hence: a cryptocurrency.
A lot of people disagree, but I more or less hold that position, and so do some others here.
There are further reason to think either Bitcoin *should* or *will* be the only such cryptocurrency that people use to a significant degree, for the near future at least (note how a big part of that argument might involve hashing power, which depends on the assumption that proof of work is important).
Boiling that down to "there is no blockchain without Bitcoin" takes most or all of the sense out of it. Apart from anything else, there are already *are* a lot of non-Bitcoin blockchains.

I know what you mean, but not even sure it works like that. To mine successfully large blocks, note that you want to be 'close' to other miners. The GFW is a slowdown in *both* directions (I speak from a fair amount of experience on that, although not as a miner).
It's interesting to think about, but it probably just complicates the argument to involve the China/GFW issue. What happens to bitcoin mining if latency becomes a more predominant limiting factor?

No. In a fundamental sense, you can only distinguish the non-equal outputs of a coinjoin. If those non-equal outputs, which are indeed linkable are then used again in conjunction with the coinjoin outputs, then the unlinking is lost. But the coinjoin outputs (the equal ones) are, themselves, fundamentally indistinguishable. For example here:  , you cannot deduce which input corresponds to which of the 0.39.. outputs. Kristov Atlas' analysis does not apply here, I don't know the details but I believe his isolation of outputs (including identical ones) is based on the features of SharedCoin. In any case, it for sure isn't possible here. Only the change outputs are linked.
Re: SheepMarket. Yeah, they caught the guy. And in a sense this is a very good point, in as much as people trying to hide criminal activity have serious problems to address if they want full anonymity. Getting blockchain transactions right so that the money can't be traced is the least of their worries; from what I've seen, criminals have managed to do that part quite easily time and time again. When they get caught, the blockchain isn't going to save them, generally.


Hmm, I haven't followed the story in detail, so I don't know if you're right there. If they recovered the BTC (who's they in this case? wasn't it in the EU?), then your point stands. But I have a feeling that didn't happen.
@_date: 2015-06-25 16:59:49
Yes, but public keys are (pretty much) always and everywhere compressed. What you gave is basically (x,y) - the coordinates on the elliptic curve. The compressed form is (sign flag (+/-), x), with the sign being flagged as a byte of 02 or 03. Because the curve eqn is y^2 = x^3 + 7, there's always a positive and negative y value for each x value. Compressed is only 33 bytes instead of 65. The x and y values are 32 bytes ; 256 bits.
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:35:58
People often put out the line that it should be like Linus Torvalds (benevolent dictator), but I think that misses the point that this is a protocol, not an operating system. In the latter, two people can run different versions quite happily, so although integrity is crucial *within* the system, interoperability between different people's systems is a lot less so.
Bitcoin is a protocol, so it's more similar to arguing about TCP. As it gains traction, it ossifies. That's one reason, I'm sure, that Satoshi tried very hard to get it fully operational before release.
I don't think we should all be losing our minds that it's so hard to change anything now. That was to be expected. And by the way this was a principal motivation for sidechains, although that is not a magic wand either.

I'd just call it interesting - especially the fact that they used colored coins.

The whole point of the blockchain (Bitcoin's) is to replace trust with cryptographic verification. Trust is a bug, not a feature, when it comes to money. See Szabo's "TTPs are security holes" for some amplification.


Bitcoin already solved exactly that problem. It's up to people to decide whether to use it or not.
If they are saying "we still have to solve trust problems with distributed databases with elementary 30 year old cryptographic primitives that we were too lazy to implement before, which we've now decided to rebrand "blockchain" for marketing reasons, and finance executives are too clueless to understand the difference" then it makes a lot of sense :)

No, it is different, because you would be loaning out a promise of bitcoin. You should think of Bitcoin as more analogous to gold.

@_date: 2015-06-13 20:28:01


I think you're overselling your point a bit. What it comes down to is that if you, in a future payment, *combine* the 0.39 with another one of the outputs, you have strongly leaked (if not proven) the fact of common ownership. It's not necessary that you do that. Think of it this way; you have 1 BTC, you mix 0.6 and have 0.4 left over in a change output. That 0.6 is in an "unlinked" state and will stay that way as long as you don't bring it "back into the fold" of your other wallet addresses. It's not impossible that wallets of some types start to support this way of doing things, especially considering the features of BIP32. Joinmarket (which created the above tx) supports this, although it's rudimentary and needs integration into a more full featured wallet.
Let's not forget the most basic privacy feature either: just don't reuse addresses in payment receipt.
@_date: 2015-12-06 16:41:56
Yes, I addressed that somewhere else in the maze of this thread :) Non-economic actors are a threat that Bitcoin's incentive model can't address, so this is one of a few reasons Satoshi's justification for "51% attack is unlikely" is not watertight, and I'm sure he knew it.
Blocking specific transactions has limitations though - it requires the full form 51% attack to be done continuously, as you'd have to overwrite blocks by any other miner out there. And it doesn't require the transaction owner to speak about it - everyone sees mempools (I mean everyone who runs a node), and high value txs not getting included would be noticed. But I guess that's a tiny, irrelevant point compared to smaller miners noticing the pattern of being forked off continuously. Bottom line, again, it's all basically in public. Governments could wreck/attack Bitcoin by this method, but only temporarily (new coin, new hash algorithm - anything really, and we all start again. Balances could be preserved from before the attack and transferred over. The more you think about it the less surprising it is that they don't do this. It doesn't really achieve the desired goal).
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:29:00
Use a deterministic wallet. Keeping 12 words secure is not hard. Cold wallet for larger amounts, hot wallet of your choosing for a similar amount that you'd put in your physical wallet.
Multisig is another security tool that can help greatly with both hot and cold wallets.
It's easy to look at Bitcoin as too dangerous when you're not making full use of its features. I don't blame people for going with easier options, but do take the time to find out about the better ways of doing things.
@_date: 2015-06-26 10:49:44
Git - yes, good example.


OK ... but it doesn't seem like that big of a deal (especially since, as you say, it is done in certain cases).


Well, the decision whether or not to use public key crypto in a system (database or not) doesn't have much to do with Bitcoin.
An question that I've thought about a lot recently is - why don't large institutional IT systems use digital signatures more widely? I think that's rather interesting (consider what non-repudiability looks like to a lawyer :) ).
I think what you're talking about is being *inspired* by Bitcoin's distributed timestamp server design. At the end of day, language is fluid, if people want to use "blockchain" to describe something because it's a sexy word, there's no point getting upset about it :)

@_date: 2015-06-11 14:40:21
Not so. If you run a node, you can verify in real time that the transactions are following the economic rules that were made public from day 1. If you don't like those rules, or if some set of people don't like them, they can fork and operate on a different coin. To the extent that there's a strong consensus (e.g. on the 21 million limit), it won't change. And the openness is the crucial thing - if some party starts to try to break the rules, they can't do so sneakily. Everyone will know.
 The whole point about "governed by math" is in opposition to "governed by violence" - of course it doesn't mean there is no choice. "You can't point a gun at a math equation" works the other way too, you can't point a math equation at a gun :)

The quote is factually false. Transactions with reasonable fees had no trouble at all throughout the spam attacks.
Byrne is a very interesting case; he has an excellent background in philosophy, logic and history, but it seems to me he's not very clued up when it comes to system architecture. His whole 'the trade is the settlement' idea misses the point quite badly. Financial systems don't have clearing in a hub and spoke model because they *can't* do it directly, but because it's more efficient the former way. Direct title transfer removes trust, but it loses a huge amount; the world will never go back to that. The right system design is to have a trustless base layer, but still to have the netting on a higher layer, that way you get the efficiency savings (time and money) but you can still have auditability to prevent fraud **even by the powerful** - that last part is the value in the trustless layer. But that layer is of course expensive, so it's only used as recourse (the Lightning idea is an example, although it can be done other ways no doubt). The choice is not between 'every global transaction on the blockchain' and the current system, it's swapping out the *base* layer of the current system with the blockchain.
You might counter-argue that you can't have auditability on the base layer if it's expensive - that expense would restrict it to the at least relatively powerful. But crucially it would always be near-free to read, the cost is only to write. Audits only need to read; *anyone* can audit the blockchain. This is another reason we need to avoid it being too expensive to run a fully validating node.

Agree with first part, but:


This is not a totally one-sided thing, right. The best you could get is to issue everything immediately at the start, so from day 1 it's purely deflationary. But that is a totally wrong way to do things also. The question of how to make a reasonable supply schedule is tricky, and Satoshi did an excellent job imo. He decided that, instead of trying to imprint some ideology onto it, he would take an analogy from nature (OK, technically it's man's interaction with nature, so maybe it's history rather than nature): the exponentially decreasing availability of a commodity as it gets extracted.

And that is exactly what Bitcoin is. What it is not is a mechanism that allows the entire world to make free, immediate electronic payments. It's a mechanism for transfer of cash which is best understood as *hard* money - irreversible payments. The idea that the entire world's retail payments can occur in that way is nonsensical, unless you increase the blocksize by 4 or 5 orders of magnitude - and actually that still won't work unless you centralize processing, which basically means you have reinvented Visa, because payments will then be reversible and censorable.

The crucial difference is PKI. PKI as implemented today is, architecturally and aesthetically, a complete catastrophe but TLS works *precisely because the user has to take no responsibility whatsoever*.
I will continue to argue with basically everyone in saying that I don't think PGP and E2E encryption generally has failed because of bad UI. It has failed because there is not sufficient incentive for anyone to take responsibility. Bitcoin or cryptocurrency *could* be the killer app for crypto, although to say the jury's out at the moment would be an understatement.
Alternatively, people will stick with the TTP model. For example, Coinbase. Nobody knows entirely how it will play out because analogies from information sharing to value sharing are not reliable; this is new territory.

Having read awemany's description, it feels like that summarizes things quite well.
It's tricky; what you are arguing is that there is some externally-set number of transactions that someone does per day, and the only question is how many people use bitcoin. (i.e. you assume t = ku). It seems like a reasonable high level model. But over some intermediate range between (nobody/everybody) uses Bitcoin, there's almost certainly a bit of feedback making t superlinear in u. One could also start theorizing about how a new payment method might lead to new payment types, but let's forget that for now.


As I think someone else mentioned, what you describe there is exponential not quadratic.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:30:47
I think it's a fair question. If you could switch quickly between these Euro colored coins and Bitcoins, it would be more interesting.
Another consideration: although it's quite inefficient to use a blockchain for a centrally managed fiat currency, it might actually be quite efficient to use pegged assets on a blockchain for transfer of value - piggybacking on the blockchain's security, and relying on your trust in the peg (you trust the bank in this case). Whether such a thing is at all scalable is another question.

You can't. That is a hash of the redeem script. The fundamental property of a cryptographic hash is that you cannot determine the input from the output.
A redeem script is only made public when it's redeemed (spent).

This characterisation is incorrect, because there is no property rights "enforcement" element (of course it's not actually enforcement, but we know what he means) without the medium of exchange element. Only the latter creates the incentive which creates the hashing power which creates the security for the former (note: I'm speaking only of bootstrap phase bitcoin, steady state bitcoin with tx fees as rewards is an entirely different ballgame).
So, A cannot be an emergent feature from B if B cannot even begin without A.

The success of one will support the other (note how this is different from gold, which has such huge frictions in being transmitted from person to person). 
It's more a question of which gains traction (or has gained traction) first. Perhaps you're right that store of value will be more important short term, but the obvious problem is the volatility of that value.


Evidence has never borne out this perspective. By far the most spending of Bitcoin was seen after its value had soared.

Yes, I vaguely remember this time, I think the general community were not convinced/not really aware of what happened (I personally don't know the details at all). I'm not arguing your if your point is simply that it's a concern - that people might not care if a pool gets over 50% and double spends. I'm just not convinced that that is true (even if it might take a while for people to realize). But hey, I'm not going to argue, I just don't think it's that clear.

I can't remember reading anything particularly sexist in development mailing lists or github issues (although I'm sure it exists here and there). On the other hand, the places where a lot of morons hang out (like Facebook, Twitter etc.) there's plenty of sexism and yet women flock to those places to discuss things, right?
And FOSS projects are open and free for anyone, that's the point. Bad behaviour of all sorts can be soft-banned by stopping contributions from a particular pseudonym but (a) forks can always be created and (b) people can create another pseudonym. Hence, it'll never be totally controlled.
If only 1.5% of FOSS contributors are women, then I see two possible **logical** responses: (1) just let people do what they want to do and don't judge (2) call out women for failing to take part and give their time and energy to worthwhile FOSS causes (I bet plenty of women *use* FOSS..)
Your third response, to blame men for women failing to take part in something where there is literally zero barrier to entry, is entirely illogical.

Did you just suggest that someone make a suggestion to change the process for making suggestions?
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:20:40
Yes, but there's more. Suppose in future you choose to spend the amounts at A and B (A,B -&gt; C,D). Someone might *infer* from that that you own both A and B, because they are both inputs to the same transaction. Satoshi even mentions this in the whitepaper. But this assumption is not safe, because of coinjoin-style transactions, where different people provide inputs to the same transaction (and note! you don't take any risk with this model, because you always get to sign the transaction before it gets sent out).
This is why people should get behind coinjoin however they can. It's not necessary that everyone does it all the time, but we need it to be common enough that people cannot reliably use the above assumption, otherwise fungibility is always going to be poorer than it needs to be.

What makes a blockchain immutable?
There are a couple of potential answers:
* public (or closed group) verifiability (everybody's watching, hashes are unique and cheap to verify)
* in case of proof of work, creating a new version with larger embedded proof of work requires a lot of ... work :)
The former can be achieved easily without a blockchain. A database can be distributed. You can have multiple parties sign database updates. The read (edit: and write) permissions on a database can be set to whatever you want. This gives immutability only in the sense that everyone else in the group can spot cheating easily. There are also issues around privacy, although that can be addressed with blinding type crypto.
The latter is what is really different about Bitcoin's design, and it's mainly focused on allowing completely untrusted parties to converge to a single version of history. But it's *expensive* , and so not ideal at all in case you have a closed system with some form of trust. What's even worse, from a banker's point of view, is that if you stick to that 100% decentralized model, you can't transfer units which are not native to the chain - if you want to do that, you have to reintroduce a trust point that you tried so hard to remove.
I think a lot of what financial entities are talking about is really the data structures - digital signatures, a linked list of hashes, and a Merkle tree for efficient storage and proofs. That's not "blockchain", those data structures have been around for several decades.
@_date: 2015-06-04 13:18:39
Are you asking for a lib to do deserialize it for you? The bytes are just there right: you can see the pubkeys 03ca.. 02057.. etc , and the other bytes are the opcodes.
I guess a lot of Bitcoin tools can deserialize it for you, I used to use pybitcointools for similar things, but I guess most things can do it if they have a transaction deserialize.

You don't really understand what Bitcoin is.
The point is to create a genuinely censorship resistant ledger which converges reasonably quickly to a consensus on global state without any need for identifying or trusting participants.
That is a very weird kind of beast, but it's *the only kind of thing that could function as money outside government (or other violent) control*. History is littered with attempts at creating private currency that failed.
Thinking that other payment systems are better because they're faster or more convenient is not the point. If they can't do that (above), they will not work, or be subsumed into the existing financial system and so be no different from it.

You're saying two different things there. One I heartily agree with - I believe "Be your own bank" is a poorly conceived slogan for Bitcoin. As for whether it replaces traditional currencies, that's a thornier question. Obviously, we're a million miles away, today, from such a thing happening, but I don't believe it's impossible in some situation in the future. With a revamped financial system, maybe fiat currencies *can* be replaced with Bitcoin or a bitcoin-like system.

@_date: 2017-12-14 18:02:18


That's not how fees work. If everyone switched to 100% segwit tomorrow, the max block size would be 2MB, within a short time the backlog would clear and there would be no competition for block space, until transaction throughput doubles. It's hard to measure, but in that fictional scenario it is *highly* likely that fees would collapse to near-zero, albeit it would be temporary.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:54:55
Not with 20MB blocks either.
To sustain thousands of transactions per second will require something different.

This is a plausible point of view.

What I haven't been happy to see is the excessive negativity toward the anti-fork-now(ish) position from the larger chunk of devs.

This appears to be a common misrepresentation; Ethereum doesn't actually exist. They are still working through problems (large or small I couldn't say) on their test network before launch.

SPV gives you that, and we have it today. It was a critical part of the initial design, making use of the Merkle tree structure. Without that, Bitcoin wouldn't be usable enough as it scaled up. To be clear, there is a security trade off, but it's a heck of a lot better than "trust a third party".

Since minrelaytxfee is now 5000 by default, that seems rather unwise (using per kB figures here). At least go somewhat higher. 20k sat/kB looks quite safe to get confirmed soon-ish, so if it's a typical small tx (2 or 3 ins, 1 or 2 outs), something around 15k sat total (~500-700 bytes tx let's say) should be fine. It's always better to err on the conservative side though.

You're right that the consensus problem is far more fraught here than in normal software, but 2 points: not *every* change in Bitcoin is backwards-incompatible, so not all changes are subject to this intense debate.

@_date: 2015-06-24 12:39:31
Bitcoin, being a protocol, is based entirely around the consensus of the nodes (untrusted and perhaps anonymous, all around the world) operating it. Like other decentralized protocols (TCP/IP for example, and of course there are others), this makes it difficult to change. What's more, the more it gets used, the more difficult it is to change. Note I'm not saying impossible - just difficult, and slow.
You're right that a lot of people, e.g. talking heads on TV, advertised it as upgradeable money. That's an oversimplification, often people talking their book. A similar one is "free transactions". We cannot have totally free transactions for obvious reasons (Sybil attack).
If you want free, instant transactions, you can go with a host of possible solutions that give up some decentralization (and therefore expose the political risk which was *the primary attack* that Bitcoin was designed to defend against - see eGold, see Liberty Reserve, heck even Paypal (which originally had pretensions to being digital cash until the regulators sunk their teeth in)). 
If you want rapidly upgradeable money, then in my view, you haven't thought carefully about what you're asking for - because something being money requires it to have neutrality, which strongly implies that there shouldn't be a voting mechanism any day of the week that can change the properties of the money that you bought last week on the assumption of a *different* set of properties. Do you see that this is not a technical question, it's that you're asking for two contradictory things - the properties of money, and the properties of a desktop app?

Correct, it's heavily subsidized (at least residential) - although I'd bet the default residential/retail rates probably aren't good enough to profit.

It's just a matter of density; online a certain kind of business, for example VPS hosting, can accept Bitcoin happily knowing that people from an entire region might choose to use it for that reason. A coffee shop, even in a modern highly populous city, simply can't do anything with the one person per square mile who might be inclined to use it. Combine that with a longish price fall and the fact that it's a nonzero practical cost for staff to know how to use it, and it's not surprising it hasn't gone anywhere. It would need to reach a critical mass much higher than today to start to become relevant in physical payments. 
It probably didn't help that some payment services set it up with (the option of) confirmation waits. If you're going to do that, you may as well not bother, that's totally impractical. For &lt; $100 it definitely isn't worth waiting for a conf.

Technically the latter is only an aggravating factor, but it aggravates it a lot so it's important.

There's a lot more to backdoor in openssl, in my opinion. PKI is a complete clusterfuck, and not only in OpenSSL. TLS is designed by committee with a lot of extensions and a lot of historical and political cruft (export ciphers!). All the famous attacks that were actually dangerous  in the last few years were around that (e.g. Heartbleed was DTLS, an extension, and the other funky named one I forgot was based on export ciphers).
And that's not all of it by a long shot. Where Bitcoin has to support one specific ECC curve and one (ignoring ripemd) hash function, openssl has to support basically *all* cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric, including a whole suite of ECC curves *and* RSA, and a whole lot of hash functions. It's a huge attack surface. Whether openssl is well coded and designed is an orthogonal question to that; if it isn't, then all the worse.

Yes, it's the combination that counts here. And it's important to see the full set of public statements, behaviour in terms of PRs etc on github, unfortunately I think some people are reading it as just about bcash, when it's certainly not just that.
Just like Andresen backing CSW was grounds for removing his commit rights, because whatever the crazy reason for such irrational behaviour is fine, just not fine for him to have a position of responsibility (in that case the concern was security, there is *somewhat* of a similar concern here due to distribution of binaries).
He can still contribute to the project but we want someone reliable in a position of adminstrative responsibility. Same here. It's not like Cobra anyone's suggesting would be blocked from contributing to Bitcoin or the website or whatever.

In my opinion this misses the point; consider gold. Did it become seen as money just because of a social construct? Treating it as money *is* a social construct, a consensus, but the ultimate cause is the set of properties that gold has; otherwise, some other random thing might have been chosen. It's the same with Bitcoin, but emphatically not the same with USD or WOW gold; in those cases they became money by fiat - they are money (in different contexts) because a central authority says so.
People often say they thing that community and consensus is more important than technology, but I strongly disagree - the set of properties comes first, the consensus comes after.

Recommending centralized tumblers when we could be using (and improving) decentralized coinjoin, such as that in JoinMarket, is sad.
What bothers me is I get the distinct impression that most people aren't even aware that you can mix coins without ever handing over control of your bitcoins to anyone else. Perhaps if they understood it was possible, they wouldn't be so accepting of the idea of "hand over all your cash to someone anonymous on the other side of the world and hope you get them back".
Would these same people choose to bundle up $10000 in cash notes, put them in an envelope and send them to a foreign country, hoping to get different notes back, if they were worried that the serial numbers might be traced?

So, again, the question in that scenario is: why a blockchain? What would they be looking to get out of it? Simply synchronising databases, as they do now, across multiple banks/servers/locations is generally going to be a lot less expensive in computation than doing proof of work.
Maybe there's some hybrid where everyone's allowed to mine, but the inflation schedule is determined by a central bank every time period T. And transactions are reversible.
It's not impossible, but at a deep level, it feels very perverse to insist on an expensive structure whose entire intent was to solve the BGP, when you don't actually need to solve the BGP because one party is in control.
Bitcoin works fine, in my mind, as a base 'hard money layer', replacing SWIFT. Just, those in charge of the world are not going to give up *both* seignorage *and* veto power over transfer, without an enormous amount of fighting.

It suits a certain arrogant old-guard perspective. Calling it 'virtual' is a way to try to paint it as like a game currency. 
I mean, I'm being very harsh; I'm sure a lot of people pick up this nomenclature without really having thought about it deeply (which would require understanding the technology fairly deeply). But there's no reason to be anything less than completely demanding with the people who presume to control our economies and by implication our societies.

Yes, but have you thought about what your hypothesis implies for the value of 1 satoshi?
In your OP you have basically argued that satoshis should be envisioned as similar to dollars, and in your title you have asked why Bitcoin (100 million satoshis) is going to gain in value. Do I need to draw you a diagram? :)

Nobody was making this argument in 2013, just after the halving. Assuming that a lower production rate necessarily implies less mining assumes that the price is not increasing.
Also, the hash rate is absurdly high right now. It wouldn't be a catastrophe if it was reduced.
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:15:19
For sure. I am thinking their idea is - peer to peer transfer of money via their app, talking to the colored coins implementation, means they don't have to keep track of those transfers on their database. From their point of view, and the individual's point of view, that might be more cheaper and more efficient than them having to keep track on their own systems. *Might* be. It could also be better from the point of view of security and availability of the system. Perhaps they can also exploit multisig setups (I have no idea, never thought about colored coins + multisig, but I guess so). Just some ideas.
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:20:24


Right. But the problem at the moment, I believe, is the lack of seamless multisig signing integration into the most popular wallets (Electrum for example). At least that was my deduction about it last time I looked into it a few months ago.

Well, fair question, not sure tbh. I tend to use hotels in different countries and I can't remember any case where I didn't have to hand over my passport. Quite possibly in some countries that's not necessary, but I would have thought *some* ID, at least to match the name, would be needed. I'm pretty sure that in at least some countries, that's a legal requirement.
To me the big news is not about what happens at the check in desk (or boarding an aircraft), but the fact that you don't have to give over private info. online where ID theft is always a danger.

It contains the classic fallacy that difficulty only ever goes up. But, through gritted teeth, I'll cut them some slack :) (Since they're trying to teach/test exponential functions).
@_date: 2018-05-16 07:50:07
Exponential functions fit many empirical observations, for a while. But of course it must break at some point. Point is it's not a part of the system; "To regulate the number of Bitcoins in circulation, the reward is not only reduced, but the difficulty of the mathematical problems is also increased" is flat out wrong, the difficulty *is* controlled by an algorithm, but not one where the difficulty is a monotonically increasing function of time. In a different context (an actual discussion of Bitcoin, rather than a made up example for a maths exam), this distinction is a massively big deal, as without it, you would fairly conclude that the system is unstable and can't work.

Hmm, I've got confused here - I was interpreting "a free market requires perfect knowledge" as "a free market in which some participants have more knowledge than others can't function perfectly, so external controls are necessary". I guess I'm just claiming that the market doesn't need an external restriction on asymmetrical information to operate correctly. There seems to be a natural feedback mechanism here - a market rewards better informed participants disproportionately, leading to those with good information participating more.
So I guess I'm really not arguing against perfect information as being required for some theoretical ideal, so much as against some static concept of equilibrium.

I tend to switch off as soon as I hear/read 'virtual currencies' applied to Bitcoin. Which of these two types of currency strikes you as virtual?:
*  The money supply can be increased infinitely at the stroke of a pen by a single person or small group of people, at any time, and immediately (e.g. : the US dollar, the Linden dollar)
*  In order for any one person or group of people to create any more of this currency you would need to gain access to enormous amounts of power (e.g. Bitcoin, gold) and in the case of Bitcoin, even then may fail because you cannot get consensus in the distributed network. Such a currency can only ever really be destroyed, not hyper-inflated.
The counterargument that Bitcoin is virtual because it is not physical is, of course, nonsense because fiat currencies are not physical either.
If the various central bankers and regulators around the world cannot master this entry-level logic, I am not very interested in the rest of what they say.

It requires a centralized authority. If a centralized authority can be trusted to control the database, the blockchain is not needed (or wanted, since it's an expensive mechanism).
"recognizing a blockchain backed method" in the simplest interpretation doesn't make any sense. The reason the government trusts the SSN system is because it controls it. Your identity cannot be "backed" by the blockchain because any person can create as many private keys as they like.
Other suggestions like tying private keys to DNA at least *might* make sense, but there are huge problems. First, it sounds horribly intrusive. Second, what's to stop someone creating a new DNA sequence that doesn't exist in nature, and pretending that's theirs? How physically intrusive do you have to be to prevent that? All the hand waving arguments are really based around unconsciously assuming there's a trusted third party in the system. And as I say, if there is, then there is no need for a blockchain.

In a way it's obvious that radio broadcast brings the blockchain to a new level, and makes it all the more understandable that even regressive governments aren't trying to block bitcoin traffic. The magic of digital signatures.
But what exactly is meant by "secure" here? There is no authentication mechanism used in the current Bitcoin peer to peer network, and there doesn't need to be. I'm wondering whether he means encryption, but encryption of a broadcast is kind of weird/doesn't work. Any thoughts?

That would be a catastrophic failure of an auction when you consider that the FBI could sell these slowly and quietly on the open market and get near to $600 for them, or at least a good fraction of them (OK, $500-550 in a pessimistic view).
I think it's a completely open question as to what price they'll fetch. Liquidity is at a premium in the BTC market, and these coins have the unique feature of definitive zero 'illegality taint' (yeah I know that shouldn't be an issue but some worry about it). I would be surprised if they fetch above market value, but I wouldn't be amazed.

I'm very sympathetic to OT's arguments about federated servers, voting pools and so on. I support that. But it still has slightly different characteristics to a p2p network.

Almost always, but not always: coinjoins come from more than one entity.
It's tricky, but realistically I'd agree that some function of the number of outputs (change must be accounted for) is the most realistic way to measure distinct economic transactions.

Point is that doing it that way gives you only a linear gain (double size for double tps) but also big negatives that probably outweigh it; if it's too difficult to verify blocks it's a big centralization pressure in mining (we already have quite enough of that!) and forces more and more users to rely on trusted third parties (somewhat; it's a complex picture).

Please explain to me what regulation I need to help me with the bitcoins I have safely stored, whose private keys have never been seen on an internet connected machine.
 Only foolish or greedy people (or honest speculators who understood the risk) leave money in exchanges for any more than a day or two here or there.
Exchanges are central points of failure and magnets for hackers and thieves (even when not run by thieves).
This is also true of "regulated" entities (Corzine? Madoff?), although I'll grant you that regulation helps in some cases, the social cost of that regulation is enormous. The beauty of it is that with bitcoin, we now have a choice. You can go with Neo&amp;Bee if you want to trust someone to keep it for you, they may or may not be regulated to your satisfaction - OK, your choice, or you can go with your own security methods, if you trust them. What you don't do is use a bucket shop trading house like Gox as a bank. That is truly idiotic.

Not only will you have a lot of trouble depositing $10K+ a week without a business account, as you correctly said, but also: anyone trying to trade that much and that frequently is leaving themselves open to stings - cf the recent Florida case. Admittedly, the claim there is that they were knowingly trading with drug dealers or something, but all the same you may be putting yourself at considerable risk. 
If you try to go the "legal" route of declaring yourself as some kind of business you have other problems - most banks point blank refuse to allow Bitcoin business accounts (the stories of this are endless), and if your business meets the definition of "money service business" (don't ask me, IANAL and the laws make no sense anyway) you face some outlandishly high set up costs and legal requirements.

Address != person
Unfortunately it's obscured in both directions: one person can own multiple addresses, but also it's possible for the contents of one address to be effectively owned by several people - not only in the concrete sense, with multisig, but more importantly, because often the big BTC-owning addresses are actually owned by a company (like an exchange), and that large BTC amount is nominally owned by lots of people.
So unfortunately those stats don't really tell you anything.

Suppose we were talking about inter*planetary* travel, e.g. between Mars and Earth.
I think in that case it could, because in the currently presented concept of a sidechain, it's understood that there's a significant delay in moving bitcoin from the main chain to the sidechain and back (e.g. large number of confirmations). So additional delay in terms of light speed communication would only make it slightly less convenient.
In terms of more sci-fi scenarios of interstellar or intergalactic travel, one is assuming that the light speed barrier has been somehow overcome; so in that case I couldn't say how the whole thing would work; if signals could be sent instantaneously then clearly Bitcoin as a whole would have no problem.

There is nothing morally wrong with fractional reserve lending, if it's optional and transparent. I.e. the customer willingly takes part in the system (and has another alternative). I believe Bitcoin brings us much closer to that goal, as bitcoin banks' reserves can be publically auditable at all times.
Any customer who chose to deposit in such an institution is taking a risk that their deposits might not be withdrawable in a bank run scenario. It's up to them to decide whether whatever benefits the bank offers outweighs this risk.

It can be done under the hood (e.g. user presses a button to "set up" a multisig, presses another button to "authorize" a payment = send a signature to another party). I've set up a number of prototypes doing this.

Two issues with your question:
1) Sending bitcoin by sending a private key doesn't work unless the receiver has perfect trust in the sender. If I send a private key to you, I might keep a copy of it, allowing me to spend the money at any time.
2) Bitcoin for remittance - we think of remittance as just a fancy way to talk about sending money internationally. It is of course possible to send bitcoin person to person internationally very easily (one of the main points of the technology). The difficulties with remittances are to do with practical realities of today's world - remittances of fiat money are only a problem for the poorer end of society who pay proportionately very high fees for such services (typically 5-10% for a migrant worker working in a rich country and sending to a poor country). In order for that person to benefit from using a bitcoin transfer instead, they have to consider (a) transferring fiat wages into bitcoin in the richer country and (b) transferring bitcoin back into home country fiat in the poorer country. The reason (b) is necessary today is because virtually no merchants accept bitcoins for goods and services in poorer countries, and similarly for (a) - virtually no employer will pay an employee in bitcoins.
So you have to understand "bitcoin remittance services" today in that broader context. In the future it may be much easier, but only if bitcoin is more widely accepted for goods and services.

If you have a friend willing to take actions to support your claim of ownership, then *any* proof of ownership can be undertaken by such friend. There is no way to distinguish between the cases (A owns) and (B owns and acts to prove that A owns).
It is not reasonable to ask for anything more than the signing of a unique message. Such signing proves that, at that time, you have control over the private key (even if it's actually your friend's private key - you have still proved temporary control over it). There is no other higher form of ownership that can actually be tested.
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:17:57
The important thing is to understand why it doesn't matter what the timestamps are. Bitcoin's blockchain is called a *distributed timestamp server* because it does timestamping itself; it doesn't rely on miner's clocks.
(This is only a high level view: timestamps *are* used in the protocol, but not in a way where there's any real trust placed in them).
@_date: 2014-11-14 09:31:28
Just in case anyone's confused: it's HMACs rather than ECDSA signatures. But of course functionally it's similar.
Another interesting point is that even with large CPU power, you can't fake a correct signature or hmac if you don't know the key; you don't know what you're looking for, unless you have some kind of "signature verification oracle" that you can keep pinging. Which you certainly don't here.

Yes, but there's nuance; e.g. userbase of LN is correlated (difficult to say how, but generally linearly) with space on-chain, although transaction throughput isn't. And over time that correlation may change and hopefully weaken (e.g. channel factories).
Then there's other off-chain stuff e.g. stuff using trusted third parties, which has a similar correlation but it's perhaps even weaker.

Well that's a good idea; at the very least worth trying, although you can see how it might not give the intended effect depending on the exact site/environment we're talking about.
Incentivizing good answers on stackoverflow is a very good example of the good and the bad of it; if the whole community wants good answers, it could incentivize that, but the problem is that *recognizing* good answers isn't always easy. Perhaps if you combined it with a reputation graph you'd end up with an algorithm for "truthiness" that's as good as Google's algorithm for relevance. Interesting to think about.
But as for reddit or social sites, I want to tip people for actual reasons, rather than just a funny joke or whatever. For charity or for encouragement for content etc. I also don't like the 'give away bitcoins as a marketing campaign' angle which seems to be motivating a lot of these people.

I agree that IBM's plans are an interesting potential application, although details are extremely scarce at the moment.
If you want to use a blockchain to record facts without paying attention to the financial aspect, then someone has to pay for the mining (and mining has to be substantial if you want any real security), and/or some centralized party has to take a controlling role. An very interesting case to look at it, more developed than IBM's, is Google's "certificate transparency" project, which is using exactly the same construct as a blockchain, sans mining.

Technical question already posed:
What if the single html page that you deliver from the user to the auditor contains session cookies? Might that not enable the auditor to take over control of a live session?
We believe that this danger can be removed by logging out before sending data to the auditor (see [instructions]( ). This is based on the assumption that session-preserving data (in the url, in the headers in the form of cookies, or conceivably on the page) may exist on the page that you're trying to audit, but what won't exist is user credentials (username/password) - this is something that can easily be checked by doing a search in the html.

r/BitcoinBeginners is a good place for questions on the basics.
Most transactions require fees to be paid, even today. There's a somewhat complex set of rules about how much needs to be paid in fees under what circumstances, and these fees are added to the coinbase transaction. It is also true in the vaguest sense that the more fees you pay, the more certain you can be that your transaction will be mined in the next block (assuming it's a standard transaction type), and the less fees you pay, the longer it might take to get the transaction confirmed (but note that zero fees is acceptable under certain conditions). The default fee for a typical transaction, today, is very small (a few cents or less).
It's important to understand that fees today serve primarily a DOS protection function, and that miner incentive is dominated by the 25 btc per block reward. Fees are rarely more than 1% of that (I don't have stats around but you can find this data easily).
A decade from now we'll be having our 3rd block halving taking the reward down to 6.25 btc per block - does that mean transaction fees will start to become a factor? Difficult to say, depends on so many things - a free market in btc transaction fees may be coming; the scale of the network, how many txs per sec it will be supporting is entirely unknown, the possibility of sidechains and how that will affect mining and tx rates on the main chain. Etc. And to try and predict what is going to happen in 2 or 5 or 10 decades is a fool's errand, of course.

I read Albert Einstein's own explanation of special relativity (well, in English translation). It wasn't simple. It was as simple as he could make it I guess, and it was well done, but it wasn't anybody's definition of 'simple'. There is no simple explanation of quantum mechanics either.

First, Bitcoin transactions have a many-many mapping. You *cannot* identify which input is paying which output.
The implications are left as an exercise for the reader (hint: coinjoin).
Second, if the receiver of your payment is 'doing it right', he is generating a new address for each received payment. This makes it rather difficult for your payer to know who your payee is.
Third, stealth addresses are another, more difficult but more powerful idea to improve privacy.

Imagine you, Alice, being able to transfer your coins to Bob, without knowing or trusting Bob, but getting a guarantee that if he takes those coins, he will release the same amount of coins, in an *entirely* different transaction, to you. By entirely different I mean, no connection on the blockchain.
This can be done using hashes, but it's tricky, if you want to do it privately - if the hash is part of the Bitcoin Script in the transaction, then anyone can see that these two supposedly disconnected transactions use the same hash. There's ways round this, but not perfect - except "scriptless scripts", which makes it so there's no hash ever shown in the script - the secret number is *embedded* in the signature, so no one can ever see it (it's not just hard, it's impossible).
This paper is a further tweak - because what I described above as "scriptless scripts" can only be done with Schnorr signatures, which are not yet available in Bitcoin. The paper finds a way to do it in ECDSA, which is what Bitcoin uses. It's more complicated but the complication doesn't occur on the blockchain, which is great if it can be made to work in practice.

This is really a Gresham's Law argument. The fact that people spend the bad money rather than the good doesn't invalidate the good money. It means that over time the average person would spend down their fiat savings to nothing, and at that point would start spending the good money.


Some contradiction here; if all the consumers prefer to hold BTC, why wouldn't merchants also?

Yes, it is in some ways a speech issue. Or at least closely related.
One *can* argue it's not a speech issue, it's an issue of overhearing private information. The hacker's "speech" in this case is packets he sends to the server. Criminalising just sending packets is highly problematic. If the bank's responses are badly thought out and leak private information, then one can assign a moral blame to the hacker, and an incompetence blame to the bank, but I'm not sure that the hacker has done a wrong that could or should be codified into law, because sending packets is exactly what TCP/IP is for.
Note that this is different from examples like pickpocketing, where money is taken without consent - a bank server has to actively choose to hand over the information.
I do realise that the law as it stands is more interested in the contractual relationship. The hacker breaks the bank TOS. But then I don't think the current legal framework would see this as a freedom of speech issue.

Well my whole point was that the "owning" part of that is not true. 
The buying part is debatable - it will depend on an individual context - do you have good technical skills? Do you live in an area where there's a large amount of bitcoin users? And other things. Technologies like multisig transactions can drastically reduce the trust required also.
And whatever small amount of trust is required in buying, it's only required for a very short time. Once it's yours, it's yours.
Oh and:


See: Cyprus, See: Argentina, Venezuela (not direct stealing but through hyperinflation) See: Italy, where 20 or 30% is taken from any inbound wire transfer. Historically, the number of examples is vast, including bank runs as well as hyperinflations.
Edit: I think the key phrase in your post is "in practice". Currently, if you live in a favourable regime, bank savings are much more reliable than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently a very risky store of value, even if you know how to protect them from theft. Bank savings for members of the "first world" are safe because your whole infrastructure is backed by "men with guns". You cannot judge bitcoin statically by its features today - you have to look at how the world is shifting.

That's a non-sequitur.
Confirmations *are* important; they're just not necessary for security for ad-hoc payments of a few dollars.
If we moved to a world in which Bitcoin was widely used, however, I'd agree we'd have to pay more attention to this question; but it would end up being addressed anyway for a different reason. 
Explanation: suppose Walmart decides to accept Bitcoin at its stores. Suddenly there is an opportunity to steal money/goods using double spends of a lot of small purchases. It would have to be carefully coordinated and timed. You have to make sure that the double spend gets accepted by the network without having the first spend get rejected at Walmart. Definitely doable but requires organisation. But here's the thing: in that scenario, you'd be seeing huge numbers of transactions via Walmart, and the raw Bitcoin network either doesn't scale to that (at least today), or it's undesirable in any case. So this scenario is almost certainly going to involve off-chain transactions; could be sidechains or could be some centralised trust-based solution. The latter is absolutely fine as far as I'm concerned, it's a trade off. This is what people don't understand - Bitcoin is *not* mainly a retail payment network. It's cash and so is useful person to person, and also as a neutral, final settlement mechanism for bigger, more serious transactions (confirmations certainly needed there).

People are always looking for ways to do this. I don't think the ideas should be dismissed out of hand. But without positing a centralised entity, it's very difficult to make a secure system (perhaps impossible, I'm not sure).
If you want a good motivation, consider how 'solving the remittance problem' is going to be very hard unless there's an easy way for people to transact bitcoin in a third world environment where people don't have smart phones and don't have internet (because if not, you have to transfer back into the local currency, which means middlemen and fees will remain, not to mention people still have to suffer from corrupt central banks).

Others are being too harsh on you, and at the end of the day nobody knows for sure what is or isn't possible. But:-
If you read the whitepaper and think carefully about Satoshi's solution to the Byzantine Generals problem, you'll see that the 51% attack is the inherent weakness in the design. It can't be altered with a minor modification. The use of proof of work to reach consensus means something like "one CPU one vote" (or better one hash/s one vote), and that means almost by definition that anyone with more hashes /s than everyone else put together has the capacity to define the future path of the blockchain. Saying it another way, it's not that the algorithm is broken, it's that if a particular individual controls more than 50% of the hashing power, they *are* the consensus.
Some people think the solution is to use a different consensus algorithm like proof of stake. I think they are wrong, in that proof of stake doesn't actually solve the BGP. Seems like most of the Bitcoin developers (a lot better than me) also have this opinion. Although I shouldn't try to put words into their mouths.

That definition is very abstract, and kudos to you for asking, because I agree it can seem a bit out of place in context.
 I think it really goes back to the earlier attempts at creating digital cash (e.g. Chaumian) - the core idea is always using digital signatures to authorise transfer of ownership. In those older models, with centralised mints, they were often talking about individual "coins" (I forget the details; part of it is to do with the use of blind signatures). Satoshi's saying "look, we start from that same idea that was always used in digital cash schemes: that you can define a coin as a chain of digital signatures", but you see as it progresses, that he's broadening this definition so much that the term "coin" becomes confusing.
In Bitcoin's model, this "coin" is actually more usually called a "utxo" or unspent transaction output. One or more of them get changed into one or more other in a transaction.
What we actually talk about as "a bitcoin" is, on the other, purely an abstraction, an entry in a ledger.
Edit: no I don't believe it's a change. It's just a slightly confusing way of putting things (to some of us).

I partly agree with you (fractional reserve is certainly not *intrinsically* fraudulent), but: 


This is far from true in practice, because ordinary people have no way of opting out of the fiat system - it is mandated by law at the point of a gun, effectively. And all fiat systems are currently operating on fractional reserve principles.
Rich people can quasi-opt out; they can store their wealth in other kinds of assets/instruments. Ordinary people whose lives are sustained only by income have no such choices. Today, Bitcoin is still remote from the lives of most such people, but it doesn't *have* to stay like that. Bitcoin is effectively a more practical form of gold, in that respect (although it's not the only reason to get involved in Bitcoin, either).
And before anybody says it: yes, you can have fractional reserve with Bitcoin too. That might happen. But the difference with gold here is *precisely* what the OP refers to - a future Bitcoin bank can be demanded to be 100% transparent about the nature of its reserve by its customers, and it will be much more difficult to force them at the point of a gun not to use their preferred Bitcoin storage method.

It's not that simple, and for a number of reasons.
* Countries have banned currencies in the past and failed. In recent times it's usually the US Dollar that gets banned, precisely because it is the most widely desired currency. Examples include the Soviet Union and Zimbabwe in hyperinflation, or Argentina today.
* There is an important prisoner's dilemma dynamic in banning something desirable. If you are the only country banning it, you lose out big time. If everyone cooperates and bans it, they may well succeed (let's say they will). This is exactly the prisoner's dilemma payoff, which famously, rationally results in defection (for a single round).

Of course. But what people keep missing is that they think Bitcoin only distributes trust. It does far more than that, it replaces the trust with proof for almost everything that current monetary systems do.
The 51% issue is in some sense outside the protocol, because the protocol never promised any more than that transactions would be executed in line with the decision of the majority of hashing power. It never, for example, guaranteed that all transactions would be executed (with or without a 51% danger).
That's the problem - there's what the protocol can promise and what Bitcoin as a payment system *wants* to deliver - the latter is not perfectly well defined, and it involves trust to assume that it will deliver the payment network with the features you want.
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:25:27
My assessment right now would be there is an enormous amount of merchant adoption going on (they've finally started to figure out that Bitcoin represents to them what would be termed in finance a "free call option" - they can get lots of potential upside with no risk). What's needed is more users and holders, many of whom seem reluctant to get involved because they think the price is "high".
Also worth bearing in mind that Bitcoin cannot support big retailers yet - e.g. Amazon or Walmart. The tech is not yet able to handle that much transaction throughput.

If people don't agree that centralised control of currency is a problem, then if they are sufficiently intelligent, then I think you will not be able to win an argument against them about Bitcoin being a valuable innovation. Centralised systems are always more efficient, although decentralised systems are  more resilient. The lack of resilience in say, a bank account, is not really a problem if the ledger is under control of a centralised party - since they can always rewrite the ledger.
Without the decentralised currency (which implies decentralised seignorage, importantly, or just no seignorage at all), Bitcoin's innovation has little or no value. If you think that the idea of transfer without a middleman is still valuable, you are confused - you can't have no middleman and still have a centralised clearing authority with the power to reverse transactions.

I have to disagree. I've tried to get involved in a lot of the arguments, because what I see is *not* interesting technical debates about the real issues, but 90% just flat out misunderstanding, thinking that risks exist which patently do not exist. People don't seem to understand that the "conservation of bitcoin number" rule is not affected by this proposal. That seems to be the heart of what they worry about, and no amount of rational argument is apparently going to change certain people's minds.
There are also concerns expressed about making risky changes (but: we can't innovate on main chain, people are already complaining about that - this enables innovation that is riskless to mainchain, because the risky behaviour is carried out elsewhere). The alternative is ossification of the main chain technology where btc is totally unable to scale up to a future with 10-100 times the transactions we have today. (OK don't want to spread FUD - it's probably true that that scaling is possible given current work, but wouldn't it be nice to offload some future imagined huge number of small value transactions?)

mne~~u~~monics. No, although several wallets (and other systems) are using the same system more or less, I don't think they're compatible. See BIP 39 for an attempt at standardisation, I think that has been pushed mainly by the Trezor guys. But Electrum, specifically the developer ThomasV, were I think the first to use/develop it.
If BIP39 gains acceptance, we could reach a point where all Bitcoin software that uses mnemonics does it exactly the same way, so the same 12 words works for Armory, Electrum, etc etc. But don't hold your breath.

You can trace both forwards and backwards, but you are tracing into larger and larger trees in both directions. Because of the many-many mapping inherent in the design of transactions.
And the result is very artificial, because if your utxo is 1 of 3 inputs which map to 5 outputs, you have to assume that each of the 5 outputs contains 1/3 of your input, which is an artificial decision. This is exactly the idea of CoinJoin; if Alice wants to pay Bob 1BTC and Charlie wants to pay Dave 1 BTC, you can create a transaction with 2 1BTC inputs and 2 1BTC outputs so that nobody knows if Alice is paying Charlie or Dave. "Theoretically" she paid 0.5 to both, but functionally it could be argued that's not what's happening at all.
All of this mess is coming from a modelling error; as MuForceShoelace said, there is no such thing as "a bitcoin" any more than there is such a thing as "an inch" - it's an abstract measuring unit. If bitcoins were concrete things (specific bits of data), then the many-many transaction design would make no sense.

Irrelevant. The question is not whether the software works (it's trivial given Bitcoin multisig) - the question is whether the incentive structure works.
Edit: I take this back. Having had a careful look at the whitepaper, I can't actually grok how it's supposed to work (apart from the paper just generally being very difficult to read, some of the Bitcoin stuff doesn't actually appear to make sense), and I can't find a codebase to read anywhere.

Having chatted with him, and having listened to that interview, I find Peter's position a bit more nuanced and difficult to pin down than that. Certainly, it's fair to say he's skeptical about Bitcoin's long term viability without serious improvements, but then he's open to more optimistic scenarios where Bitcoin remains the "high powered" money network acting as a backbone, with other important features as satellites. He also seemed to agree with me that proof of stake ultimately doesn't make sense as a replacement for mining. But I'm in danger of putting words in his mouth now so take all that with a grain of salt :)

Impossible to figure out. I'm going with 3M, which is on the high side, but there is a huge cloud of uncertainty over Satoshi's 1M ish, which it seems like now will never be spent, which would make it academic whether the private keys are lost, Satoshi's dead, or he just decided not to spend them for - reasons.
I don't think the Gox coins were lost, but it's at least possible that some of them were lost due to incompetence.
Let's not forget all the exchange/company 'hacks', many of which may have been simply thieving by the owners, many of which may have been actual hacks, but again - in some cases coins may be lost due to incompetence.
Reasonable conjecture: a lot of coins lost in the early days due to just messing around and not caring. In fact, if we ignore Satoshi, by the far the biggest quantity of lost coins will just be sitting on hard disks which then get thrown away (remember the rubbish dump case in Wales) or the owner forgets the password to the encryption. I would not be surprised if 500K of coins is lost to just that last case alone.
I've thrown away probably 0.05 in running tests over a long period. Yeah, you should use testnet but sometimes you don't. Also my only incident of losing coins by accident was a crash of my phone. It was 0.2 or so, pretty much the max I allowed myself to hold on a phone, but they weren't worth as much then (about $150 per btc I think). Think of it this way: if 5 million people do similar things over a couple of years, then that would be 0.25 x 5 mill, more than a million coins over 2 years.

Yes, that's a pretty good example of what a lot of people have to deal with, myself included, when making international transfers. IBAN was actually a European invention; although it's supposed to be "international", it doesn't apply to US or Australia or Asia etc (or at least, not until recently). The confusion caused by the fact that each country has a different way of enumerating bank branches, with SWIFT codes being an international alternative for the same information, makes the whole thing far worse. You have to understand the difference between SWIFT code, Sort code, BIC code, Routing number, BSB number, plus god knows how many others.
Quite frankly, it's a nightmare and a wonder people aren't losing their money all the time. I'm sure that's part of what makes it slow - as you say, they need human eyes on the data to make sure things work right.

Nothing prevents services being created on top of bitcoin that include chargeback, if that's what the market demands.
People constantly get confused about this point. Bitcoin doesn't *disallow* third party intermediaries (how could it?). It recreates the model of cash for online payment, but with the superb extra feature of non-confiscatability (which occurs with fiat in two ways: by stealth, via inflation, and overtly, via actual confiscation - see Cyprus).
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:22:44
It may be a matter of timescale; it's inconceivable that such a thing could happen within a year or two, not least because Bitcoin is completely unable to handle that level of transaction bandwidth. And even if it could, governments would go to very great lengths to prevent it, of course, which at least is going to slow it down a lot.
Also it seems very likely that even if crypto completely "wins", Bitcoin won't be alone (and may not even be one of the winners).
Where gold and silver were introduced, other commodities were effectively removed as currency, because they were so inferior. There is no reason to believe that this isn't happening again. And of course it doesn't imply that governments would be "ruined", as long as they switched their unit of account to something backed by this superior form of money at some point.
But the 'all or nothing' argument when thinking about the *long term* is not something to dismiss. Honestly I don't see the counterargument. "When you play the game of currencies.." :)

Downvote me to hell, but I see the concept of "insider trading" as related to the concept of "intellectual property". It's a nonsense. You can make it mean something if you like, but I don't want to live in that world.
Basically it's thoughtcrime. If one of a group of friends at a bar hears another in the group, who happens to work at company A, tell a third person in the group about the troubles occurring at that company, and I hold stock in company A, then it is illegal for me to sell my stock as a result of that information. You're supposed to report it to your local financial gestapo or something.
And yes, I know that unscrupulous people will use inside information to their advantage. You should act in the market fully aware that such people exist - people who know a lot more than you do. Does anyone really think it's appropriate that there should be laws to attempt to ensure that every participant has the same information? 
Markets are entirely based on information, and the better information they get, the better they behave. The "cure" for this is far worse than the disease.

I've always been utterly bemused by people proposing this, just like people proposing 'local currencies'. Do these people have any idea what currency *is*? It is a method for solving the double-coincidence of wants issue, it is an *abstract centralization*. Hub and spoke is more efficient than many to many. The beauty of bitcoin is you can achieve this centralization at the abstract layer without having to have the ugliness of centralization in the real world of people (corruption, violence).
The more people use a currency, the more useful it becomes. Thinking that a currency for just for one town is somehow desirable seems like some kind of brain malfunction to me. We get that you don't want a central bank controlling your local economy, but making transactions massively more inefficient is not the way to solve it. Otherwise why not just go back to barter?

It's worth thinking about ways of avoiding this stuff. Not specific things like "I should/shouldn't press this button in my wallet software" but higher level things like - whenever I do something new, I want to try it with a play amount first (0.1mBTC for example). I've used that principle in moving stuff between wallets several times. Another perhaps more extreme idea is to use what's sometimes called "the four eyes principle" - e.g. if you have a partner or family member, have them watch you do it.
There are no silver bullets, but the most important thing is to have your guard up. You *should* be nervous when performing "real money" BTC transactions.

That's not low, that's around 2%. 
I remember doing a similar calculation for UK-Philippines and came up with around 8% all-in including exchange rates. See here: 
The problem with this thread is that "spread is roughly 5%" is ambiguous - it could be 5% from bid to ask, which is decent, or 5% from bid to mid and 10% from bid to ask, which is not competitive.
I think a Bitcoin based service needs to aim at being &lt; 5% all-in, including any exchange rate and fee, to be worth people's time. Eventually I'm sure it will go down drastically even from that.

Going back say 10 years I would have taken the same position as you outline in paragraphs 2-5 of your post. In short, anarchy leads to what we have today, so trying to remove the hierarchical system we have today is futile.
But I have changed my mind, mostly because of bitcoin but also because of other decentralised systems and related technologies, in particular asymmetric encryption technologies (which are key enablers of decentralisation, as they drastically reduce the need for trusted third parties). I believe that technology has brought us to a point where it is possible to have voluntary human interaction without hierarchical power structures, not entirely, but to a far greater extent, and that the world is slowly moving in that direction. Take the internet, PGP, wikipedia, bittorrent, bitcoin and tor as the standout examples, but I'm sure one could think of others.
That the current status quo is the "best we can realistically get" is a very realistic take, only if you ignore these changes.

That kind of problem works itself out organically over time. The real sticking point right now is how fiat money is tied into the government; it's the only acceptable way to pay taxes or settle debts in court. Because it's tied into laws, it's also necessary for businesses to use it, to pay certain taxes, for audits etc. - and so obviously they tend to pay wages in it almost exclusively, and so on down from there.
That's why some freedom to change between fiat and crypto is needed in the short term. I guess I'm stating the obvious now :)

If the USB stick is lost, it doesn't matter if you kept the 12 word seed on paper/remembered it (here I'm describing how it works for Electrum, which I'd recommend). Going online: yes, that's the easiest way - what I do is fire up TAILS from a USB, and because it's not touching the disk, there's no chance of any malware on the computer infecting it. I then install Electrum (takes only a minute or two) and do the transaction. Note that even though this is quite easy, it's still a bit of a hassle for just little everyday transactions. For that, use a smaller wallet anywhere you feel comfortable -  your PC or a phone. Also, TAILS is certainly not necessary, you could do the same with various other linux distros. With TAILS you have to deal with connecting to an Electrum server over Tor. For extra security, you can also sign transactions on a completely offline system.

@_date: 2014-04-17 19:36:26
No. The explanation is complicated, but principally the point is: currency is not a bank.
If you store money with a third party, you really enter into a contract with that third party. Thus for example, you think you "have money" at your bank, but really you don't; you have a certain promise from a bank that they will honour withdrawals. This promise is a long way from absolute, for example you are in Cyprus, or you are suspected of being involved in a phishing or money laundering scam.
Bitcoins are digital *cash*, not a bank account. If I spend them online, it's like spending dollar bills - the transaction is not encumbered by a third party. That's why it's both far more convenient, and far more secure, for me to buy something online with Bitcoin than with a wire transfer or a credit card (however convenient the latter may seem, it is first not really secure as you pass over identity information, and it is also slower than paying via Bitpay for example). If you don't believe me, try it - it is really extremely simple.
An online banking service is an interface to a secure third party who takes control of your funds and allows you access to them on their terms. A similar service can be created with Bitcoin (a Bitcoin bank) and I'm sure such things will eventually exist, but note that a certain kind of hybrid - where the funds are controlled by multiple keys - will make for very interesting improvements on banking models.

For whom am I speaking? Partly for myself, and partly from the design as laid out in the whitepaper.
The part that is definitely my own opinion only is the last part: that 90% of people will not be able to secure their own bitcoin. I am going on practical experience (not mine, but from looking at the behaviour of people).
I agree that Bitcoin holds up an idealised possibility: of total control over one's own finances. To whatever extent that's achieved, I'm in support. I don't see that happening in our lifetimes, for the majority. Ordinary people are not currently capable of that.
But the part that I'll insist on is that bitcoin is *not* a credit mechanism, and was never designed as such. That requires some kind of counterparty. Bitcoin is cash or a commodity because it is an asset without counterparty risk. That's mainly what I'm getting at when I say "With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank" is a misleading slogan, as well as the security difficulty point above.

Let's clearly distinguish between "hasn't", "doesn't" and "never will". The last is obviously pure speculation/guesswork. The first is just plain wrong, Satoshi sent out quite a few test transactions in the early days, the first being to Hal Finney. The "doesn't" one is a little more nuanced: it's easy to see that for a long time (years), Satoshi has not been touching the early 2009 btc that he mined almost exclusively. While we can never say for sure that Satoshi isn't spending coins (because we don't know who he is, duh :) ), we *can* say he isn't moving *those* coins (hasn't been doing so for years, anyway).

The two big use cases are: the one you mention, and the store-of-value-which-can't-be-confiscated. Both of them depend on the other. If nobody treats it as a store of value, then it won't be a generally accepted medium of exchange. If it isn't a generally accepted medium of exchange, then most won't treat it as a store of value (a speculative minded person may treat it as a potential future store of value - and this was exactly the basis for bootstrapping that both Satoshi and Hal Finney were observing in Jan 2009).
So I somewhat agree that all the people making complex calculations about how much it costs to convert on each end for the remittance are missing the point - the real point is when the conversion isn't needed, the remittance cost drops to basically zero.

No; the three "signatories" are expressed as public keys, each of which corresponds to one private key.
So the redeem script (the script which controls redemption) looks like this:
2 PUB1 PUB2 PUB3 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
and that script is hashed and put into the output of the transaction paying into the multisig.
Then, when you want to redeem it, you need to provide a signature corresponding to any 2 of PUB1, PUB2, PUB3. Say, for example, you can provide SIG1 and SIG3. But to provide that signature you need to hold the private key for that pubkey.
A multisig address doesn't have a single (private, public) keypair corresponding to it.

If I understood you right, you're really talking about secret sharing, which is not the same thing - in multisig, one only shares signatures, which can be public, whereas secret sharing schemes require the centralisation of secrets in one place at some point.

The problem is not *purely* the Sybil attack, although that's most of it. Sybil attacks can be mitigated against in many systems by introducing costs for identity creation.
The problem with voting is specifically what evidence is used to validate a human identity. If we were OK with '1 dollar 1 vote' then there would be no problem with a decentralized voting system (or, at least, it would be feasible).

If there are reasons for having other cryptos than bitcoin, it's something one would have to think about carefully. It's a very complex issue, especially when you consider protocol layering, side- and tree- chain concepts, anonymity and privacy, and many other factors. But the case with silver v gold is fairly obvious. It doesn't alter my point, which still stands - the analysis given in the OP by Greenspan is too simplistic.

There is no 'community', at least not in a sense that can ever be well defined. Some people may choose, at some time, to use Bitcoin in a centralised way. I have no problem with that, that's their choice.
I kind of agree that it's more about free market than decentralization, but the problem with that view is: what makes bitcoin support free markets is its uncensorability/uncontrollability and that doesn't really exist without at least some degree of decentralisation.

This is not at all unusual nowadays (any time in the last 3 years really) for fiat-BTC exchanges. They do KYC/AML and they ask about source of funds.
Even worse, they do the kind of BS and morally unacceptable "blockchain analysis" mentioned here, and it's done as a black box - you can't question it. That even happened in court in the Netherlands apparently. A person's financial history can be erroneously attributed, because tainting doesn't work with 100% reliability.
If they searched my blockchain history, for example, they'd come up with a bunch of garbage, as most of my coins have gone through hundreds or thousands of coinjoins, and so are "mixed" with tons and tons of other wallets.
The Orwellian nightmare of finance is becoming more and more a reality: you have to prove you haven't committed (thought)crimes. It's not up to them to prove you have. (this applies to fiat just as much of course, except there's less suspicion there *on average*).
Altcoins including privacy focused ones won't help much here, when they insist you prove that your coins *don't* come from somewhere bad - if you went through that altcoin, it must be dirty, so you're blocked.
And just a final cheery thought - cash (physical) is becoming rapidly extinct!

For storing funds long term you're well advised to use a local wallet, not any kind of web wallet (even the safest kinds). 
For that, I strongly recommend Electrum because it removes the need for backing up a wallet file. 
It's strongly recommended to use an entirely separate OS stored on something like a USB stick for accessing the wallet, especially if it's got a lot of BTC on it. You can also use paper wallets for long term storage, another good solution I think. 
These 'serious' mechanisms are designed to keep your coins as far away as possible from the internet. Think of the internet as a disease, your coins must be quarantined :) (This is called 'cold storage' by the way).
For "medium term storage" - coins that you want to access fairly regularly, but more than you would carry in cash on the street - this is the most difficult one in my opinion. You can go with a wallet on your normal PC, but you have to have good security practices with that. There are a pretty large array of options nowadays, including multisig based web wallets; I understand it's confusing and I hesitate to make a recommendation because I don't understand the kind of hack that you experienced (I guess it's do with email, but I don't know).
For casual spending, use anything that seems reasonably safe (e.g. a good mobile wallet or web wallet), but know you're not fully protected.
Whatever route you go down, do it slowly and carefully, using small amounts at a time.

I think your real problem here is that you don't actually know what question to ask :)
By that I mean you're clearly curious about the *mechanics* of how Bitcoin security works, but you don't have the vocab to ask the question.
What you should try to understand first is how public key cryptography works, at a basic level.
Then you should look up the idea of digital signatures, which are really an application of public key cryptography. Wikipedia has a reasonable explanation, but there are better ones out there too.
Once you've really understood digital signatures, then the mechanics of how a bitcoin is spent, and how it's kept safe, will become reasonably clear, although of course you could spend a year educating yourself to deeper and deeper levels about it.
Here is the most BASIC idea of public key cryptography: how can we share a secret without telling it to one another? It sounds impossible. But it isn't :) I hope that piqued your interest enough to find out about the topic, because a curious person should start there if they want to understand things like private keys in Bitcoin.

**This is happenstance. The protocol that gives rise to these digital currencies- the bitcoin protocol (small b)- could easily implement a different supply model.**
Satoshi Nakamoto, 2009:


In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.
The question of whether he would have done it differently if he could is interesting but *mostly* academic. It has been discussed (e.g. by Buterin but also many others) that you could have supply sensitive to the transaction volume. I do not think it would be desirable, personally. It is another potential source of system instability. I believe Satoshi chose the precious metal/ commodity money model because it fit with what he was building and it would have been architecturally an ugly stretch to try to do it a different way. I also believe he generally *preferred* that model of money, because of the earlier quote from the same place:


Edit: I've slightly misrepresented/oversimplified in my paragraph above. Of course any kind of supply schedule, including an infinite supply, would have been possible as long as it was predictable or deduced from the internal system state (varying with transaction volume being the most obvious one but perhaps other internal state measurements are interesting like 'days destroyed'). What's impossible is varying supply according to external factors like prices of real world goods and services, without having some trust in the system at the point where that data gets fed in.
So the choice of a *finite* supply was very much Satoshi's choice. But his choice to not respond to the price of goods is not really a choice - that was never going to be possible in a trustless system.

It is possible, but why not use a database then (as they do now)? It's computationally cheaper and more efficient. A blockchain has the advantage that nobody can edit or block transactions. That's the basic trade off.
Weird hybrid solutions may well arise, but that's the fundamental difference you have to see. A lot of people saying "the blockchain is what counts, not bitcoin" are focusing on non-currency applications, which certainly can exist, but if you're looking at a money transfer system, it will never be totally decentralised unless the medium of exchange token is intrinsic to the system.

No, it's not "can't work with encryption". It's that I'm talking about how to store *encryption keys* not the encrypted data. Storing bitcoin means storing keys. You can wrap it a further layer by then encrypting private keys, but then you're solving the problem of storing those keys at the second layer, so it's basically the same thing.

To answer your point seriously: this kind of stealing is a direct result of using known insecure methods of generating Bitcoin private keys.
Bitcoin is not a replacement for bank accounts, despite the "be your own bank" slogan. Nor is it a replacement for credit cards. You can use it to replace these functionalities, if you choose, but never forget that Bitcoin itself is cash, not an IOU from a powerful third party. There are a wide variety of security models for keeping this cash; you can choose a third party trust model (Coinbase, presumably Circle), a very badly conceived third party trust model (store coins on an exchange), a trust-no-one model with sound security features (paper wallets, cold storage), a low security model for convenience (throw $50 on your phone, just like in your wallet it could be lost any time), a hybrid model using multisignatures (which can have excellent security features depending on how it's set up), or a terrible security model such as using a passphrase from a book to make a brainwallet. You can choose any mixture of these.
If you're not currently capable of creating your own high security solution, then you'd be well advised to not invest much in Bitcoin, or choose a third party that you feel you can trust highly. I personally don't think there are such entities in Bitcoin yet. It's definitely improving though.
@_date: 2014-09-15 17:50:30
All the "serious" attempts to analyze Bitcoin by these establishment analysts (by serious I just mean that they actually bothered to read the paper and find out how it works) always fall at the same hurdle: they start from the bias that they want to see it as a purely an technological innovation in payments, because they simply cannot believe that the existing power structure of finance *can* be upset by technology. They have already seen innovations like options, swaps, futures and similar derivative structures on the one side (let's say 'software'), and telecommunications innovations on the hardware side. All of these innovations are *enabling* innovations - they just make it easier for people to do things. 
On the other hand, the matter of financial power, of what entities in which we place trust and control - they think that that is the preserve of politics, social structures and culture, not of mathematics.
I think that if they study history a bit more carefully, they will find that they're wrong.


Is there any chance that these morons are ever going to notice that you cannot have a decentralised (*no* owners - none!) financial system if one party controls the issuance of the currency?! And that without decentralisation you don't get the cost savings they think are the only point (which of course, they're not)? Do they really think it's some great idea to have a cumbersome, expensive blockchain controlled by a central party when they could just, you know, use a database?!

That's physical violence, not speech. Speech, in this context, is the transfer of meaningful patterns, not the medium through which those patterns are carried. Drawing a word on my body with a blowtorch would similarly be violence to my person, the pattern/speech involved is irrelevant.


Most definitely (tacit assumption - you're asking about my interpretation, not the law's interpretation).


Not sure if this is a speech issue? But interesting example. Let's say you made a forgery of my house key and used it to get into my house and steal all my things. According to my way of looking at things, the forging of the key is not something that should be treated as a crime - it's just a pattern, it's not violent in itself. Entering my house and taking my things when you were clearly conscious that they were not on offer but private property, is a violation and in some sense or other a crime.
So about hacking in general I'm not sure. I think very many of the actions for which people are being prosecuted in that area should not be treated as crimes, but I don't claim that none of it is criminal/immoral.

The actual effect of systems like SEC regulation is certainly not to prevent people getting scammed. The effect is to create a huge opportunity for the well connected to get easy access to funds by scamming both 'sophisticated investors' (which according to the SEC means people with a lot of money - yes, in case you didn't know, that is literally their criterion) and unsophisticated ones.
A good example is the spate of utterly fraudulent Chinese companies that were able to float on US stock markets over the last 5 years. This is because the nexus of political and economic power in control of these regulations (big 4 accounting firms, regulatory bodies, stock market owners and politicians) had no incentive to actually implement the kind of checks they claim are put in place to 'protect the little guy', but were instead in thrall to corporate and political interests who preferred to allow it. Such scenarios are far worse than an actual free market, since the regulation gives false stamps of approval (the accounting firms did shockingly immoral things in this respect).
This is called 'regulatory capture' and it was ever thus.
Meanwhile the opposite flaw is also all too apparent - the same 'little guy' is never allowed to invest in hedge funds or things like Second Market's BIT for his 'protection'.
In actuality, the market will always price risk better than regulators. This means that stupid, lazy or greedy people will get a better deal than they would under a system which attempts to control the market - either by lower prices or higher rates of return for assets which are genuinely very risky.
And people who are both greedy and stupid will lose their money whatever systems are put in place, unless you decide to shut down markets entirely. The latter becoming rapidly impossible due to new technologies like Bitcoin, thankfully.
So the effect of trying to 'protect the little guy' through regulation actually makes the little guy much worse off relative to the elites, who control the regulatory levers of power and make sure the game is always tilted in their favor.

Although I agree with "yes they are, simply put", it's important to understand the one-way relationship. An address can be derived directly from the pubkey, but to go the other way - to derive a pubkey from an address, is not possible. 
However you can recover a pubkey from a signature (combined with the message it signs), and then re-hash it to check it corresponds to the right address, so in practice this limitation doesn't really apply in dealing with Bitcoin transactions.

Join the club. I can see essentially two reasons, from my investigation, why multisig isn't implemented properly at most of the dark net markets  - (1) the client tools that the buyers use are not yet point and click for multisig and (2) it doesn't offer enough benefit to the server operators, only technical costs. But 2 is debatable, as far as I can tell it's principally (1) that's the problem.

I've heard this before but I don't understand the logic. When oil was discovered, it made a few people very very rich. Was that the point of it, or was the point to give us all an effective means of transportation, cheap plastics and heating? The point was obviously the latter, but the people who enabled that in the early stages became wealthy. Why is that surprising?
You may counter: but it's just a currency. Just buying the currency shouldn't entitle anyone to a profit. This ignores the risk aspect. Just like anyone who bought Apple stock in the early days and sat on it - after 15,20 years they made a ton of money, for doing nothing. Meanwhile they had to take the risk of seeing huge slumps in valuation, and saw it multiple times. Likewise early Bitcoin adopters had to sit through a 90% drop plus several 50% drops, sometimes in a matter of hours rather than days (of course, most didn't sit through all that!). It's purely a matter of choice whether you take the risk of possible collapse for the potential return. 
And it's grossly unfair to accuse the winners after the fact that they 'don't deserve it', when you yourself had the chance to do exactly the same thing but chose not to.

But think about the regulation around trading accounts. If you've ever opened a brokerage account (especially for stock trading, but also Forex), there's a bunch of forms to fill out, supposedly for consumer protection. In many cases you're not allowed to trade certain instruments unless you confirm you have a certain number of years experience, and unless you have a certain level of income/assets. Still, you may have a point in that forex is in a bit of a grey area with this stuff. The details are complicated and depend on jurisdiction,etc. But governments are unwilling or unable to class bitcoin as anything in particular, certainly including as currency, so that brokers may be taking a significant risk if they allow trading in it.

Not a very good summary of security advice imho. 
First, generating private keys on an airgapped, internet disabled machine is probably the best and important choice for someone to store significant amounts, and you missed that out. Using a wallet generated on your home, everyday laptop, even if Linux, is very insecure indeed.
Second, although it is excellent/essential advice to "practice with small" and "learn about change addresses", the first part: "Don't use paper wallets unless you are an expert" is way too strong. As Andreas A. likes to point out, humans are *very* good at physical security compared to digital security, so once you've figured out the basics, paper wallets are a good practical solution for most people.
Third,"don't ever use brainwallets" is popular advice but based on a profound misconception. "Don't ever generate brainwallets using your own seeds" is good advice, but using electrum seed phrases as brainwallets is arguably quite a good method (all the more so because of deterministic wallets), and an extremely powerful technique when combined with the air-gapped machine for generating private keys.

The big issue right now is in the architecture of exchanges, so I do think you're half right. Withdrawal procedures, and by implication any custom software on exchanges, has to correctly account for these potential txid alterations.

You're not 100% right about that actually:  , 
A way for an auditor to verify a bank balance without trusting the auditee; only needs to trust the bank's public key. So it's trust still - but it's a kind of trust hack. You don't have to ask the bank's permission, but you can leverage your trust of it to verify what you want to know about an untrustworthy party - the auditee.

Take the example of Wall Street; the reason the big investment banks are so powerful is *precisely because* of the regulatory structure, which allowed TBTF to happen, and encouraged concentration into a few large players (why be 2 banks without an implicit gov guarantee when you can be 1 bank with?). 
I'm not saying very large quasi-monopolies won't happen in the absence of regulation. I think a good example is Microsoft - things like this happen naturally, but equally naturally they get eroded and replaced.

You're not factoring in the enormous difficulty (=cost) of trying to enact a double spend. As soon as you spend, that tx gets broadcast all around the network. Trying to send another spend later will not work without substantial shenanigans.
A feasible attack exists in which the double-spender essentially "tricks" the vendor by having the vendor accept a transaction mined by a network peer that the double spender controls. See  This hasn't been proved practical yet, and this defense has been suggested:
"The research paper Two Bitcoins at the Price of One finds that the protocol allows a high degree of success by an attacker in performing race attacks. The method studied in the research paper depends on access to the merchant's Bitcoin node which is why that even prior to this paper, recommendations for merchants include disabling incoming connections and to choose specific outgoing connections[1].

The question is not *who* is making the guarantee, but what it is a guarantee *of*. Bank notes in the UK say "I promise to pay the bearer 5 pounds" on a 5 pound note. On US notes there is not even a promise, just a directive: this must be accepted as payment for debts.
What does the US government promise a holder of 10 dollars? i.e. what is guaranteed? The only answer you can give is some kind of circular reference, it's guaranteed that this note is good for 10 dollars worth of goods and services. That is a meaningless guarantee.

It's an interesting question as to what strategy *would* maximize their profits. I have a theory that announcing about 6 months in advance (not 3 weeks!) and selling on the open market (not restricting bidders to 'qualified investors' or whatever) would do a better job of getting the maximum value. I know it sounds ridiculous (i.e. flooding exchanges with tens of thousands of coins at once) that this would create more value, but markets are not always intuitive.
Of course even if I'm right, they would have to respect the technical difficulties of having too much volume on exchanges, but that could be alleviated by doing 5K at a time over a period of weeks, say.
And because of "legal" reasons, there's no way in hell this would happen.

I suppose someone working for a pittance in the middle East and having to pay 10% + transfer fees to send money back home to their family doesn't "need" a service that reduces that fee to less than 1%. I suppose a person living in a corrupt dictatorship where their own currency is losing 50% of its value in a year, but they are prevented by law from exchanging to a more stable currency, doesn't "need" a store of value which they can take across borders as a brainwallet and no thug can see it. I suppose a person living in a small African country and wishing to buy goods from a reputable American company, who cannot get an international credit card or Paypal account but is willing to pay cash for the goods, doesn't "need" a secure form of digital cash.
The small minded parochial attitude which I implicitly criticize here is not exclusive to the naysayers; in my opinion far too many of the supporters of Bitcoin are far too interested in the trivialities of how to get Bitcoin accepted by retailers, when the value added of that is not very big.

Would they have been happy about removal of oversight in 2008? If AIG hadn't been bailed out, the whole lot of them would have fallen like dominoes.
Edit: to clarify, it's a common opinion that lack of regulation was a cause of the derivatives crisis. But that is wrong, and here's an aspect of why: in order for certain large pension funds (heavily regulated) to buy certain assets for their portfolio, they had to be rated triple-A by a (heavily regulated) accredited credit agency, - with government/regulators deciding who gets to be in that magic 4. Then *political* incentives (of course financial also) sway these ultra-powerful 4 credit agencies into making entirely erroneous assumptions in their assessment of MBSs. Thus leading to a huge worldwide swath of big asset holders buying up this crap. It came out of far too much power being centralised in one place.
Don't forget that exactly those regulations which people think (wrongly imo) protect them from abuse are the same ones that prevent genuine competition, since starting a bank becomes somewhere between difficult and impossible (e.g. in the UK no new banking licenses in over a century).
In my original message I didn't bother to mention the fact that most of the regulators are Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan alumni.... This is another problem with regulation - regulation by who? Democracy does not magically create a set of perfectly trustworthy and perfectly wise arbiters. Note that my argument is not that it isn't better to have a fair system, my argument is that trying to create fairness in a naive way through a centralised 'regulator' is actually *much worse than useless*.

You're making the same mistake again of trying to assess the value of properties in an additive way. It's not like that - they interact with each other creating nonlinear effects.

Badly missing the point. I don't trust those people because I don't have to. There is no need for trust in simply holding and transacting peer to peer, because Bitcoin replaces trust with cryptographic verification.
* No one can cheat and print some extra Bitcoin for themselves. Governments can and do print fiat whenever it suits them.
* No one, including powerful governments, can confiscate my bitcoins because they don't like something about me.
These are the principal differences, and no trust is needed for them to be true.


In a Bitcoin world he won't be using an exchange. He'll be sending money back home to his family, directly peer to peer and they will be able to spend it. Again, that's the whole point. Read the white paper. It's precisely about removing the trusted third party.

You do understand that you have to trust someone for something like a few hours at most?

That trust requirement is feature of the fiat world which you're dealing with in that one specific trade.
After that process is completed you need trust no one but yourself.

It's what businesses are clamouring for. And some ordinary people, true, but they'll be a niche mostly.

I think we largely agree on all that. The problem is that there is no stable equilibrium where Bitcoin is a little niche internet currency. If it is not actively attacked, it will slowly take a bigger and bigger share of the currency market (witness your own "no brainer" comment), which will effectively entirely remove the seignorage power of governments. On the other hand regulating it, if successful (big if), will remove all of the properties that you and others find desirable (see my last paragraph in the previous comment).
Bottom line, it *is* a challenge to state power, whether that's seen as a desirable property or not - “Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.” Mayer Amschel Rothschild.

I know this is standard academic economics, but most of it isn't logical imo.
Rationality: this is a very poorly defined term. The assumption is only used because it helps to build toy models.
Perfect knowledge: no, you can't claim that free market is a bad system in the absence of perfect knowledge. Asymmetric information leads to advantages for the better informed - of course! That's the point - better informed participants are better rewarded, thus maximising the information embedded in prices. In the absence of this property, the market will not price in information efficiently.
Externalities - this is indeed a problem, and an argument for regulated markets. But regulated markets are not a complete panacea. Perhaps Lighthouse-type models will work better in the future for the creation of public goods or addressing externalities/tragedy of the commons stuff.

The whole point about Bitcoin is that it is digital *cash*. It's not credit, and it doesn't have counterparty risk. Think of it as digital gold, and you're not far off, except it's (a) a much smaller market for now (and correspondingly more risky/volatile), but (b) much, much easier to use than gold in actual commerce.

The issue is not the length of the passphrase, it's the amount of entropy.
In general, a passphrase with sufficient entropy is also one that is difficult to remember. That is why a naive brainwallet is a very bad idea.
There is somewhat of an exception to that rule. Investigate the "mnemonic phrase" concept used by Electrum, Armory and others. Although I don't recommend at all storing them only in your brain.

Not even that (and btw congratulations for observing the obvious reality about Cyprus which seems to be beyond 99% of people who comment on this stuff..). Bitcoin simply had an absolutely epic bull market/rally starting around Nov/Dec 2012. It just went up week after week after week. By March it was very difficult to see how it would not end with some kind of bubble burst event.

Yes it does. Because of the fungibility; if a scCoin can *always* be exchanged 1 for 1 with a bitcoin, then the arbitrage applies.

OK, so you're asking something like: how can I store this digital file safely so that in future I can recover its hash. Not sure, but .. zipping shouldn't matter, corruption of the filesystem is certainly possible, so you'd want at least 2 or 3 different copies I guess. Since one flipped bit completely ruins your scheme, I understand your nervousness.
I can only repeat that in crypto one is strongly advised not to "roll your own" - precisely because, as you're sensibly observing, there are a ton of unknowns and it isn't realistic to be able to predict them yourself.

I understand your point that "stealing" coinbase is not the same as stealing user bitcoins,  but any proposal to reallocate the coinbase is completely out of the question imo. 
Bitcoin's most fundamental property is its neutrality. If it loses this, it is not Bitcoin.
This is more important than the problem of unconfirmed transactions being somewhat unreliable. There are other ways to approach this than hacking a core feature of the protocol like the coinbase transaction.

Yes it's 'legitimate' (it's real) but does it have any meaning? An individual trader could have a set of bots trading billions of btc per day at zero EV, without it really costing anything. This wouldn't tell us anything about anything.
But since you already said the argument isn't based on volume, not much point talking about it I guess. Arguments based on correlation with news events are very difficult to back up substantively (news is an inherently subjective concept). It's a judgement call; maybe you're right that the data better fits 'China leads', but I personally wouldn't put a huge amount of weight on such a viewpoint. Even in more mature markets, in very obvious cases where news should lead price changes, about the best you can say is that certain types of news events lead volatility; price change direction is always unpredictable.

It's not a trivial question, though is it. The principle of no arbitrage largely applies, because sideChainCoin is fungible with Bitcoin, even though it is not exactly the same thing. So if I were a holder of sidechaincoin, and someone offered me .9 x (current BTCUSD price) for my sidechaincoin, they would have a heck of a time trying to convince me to sell it at that price, because with a click of a button I can convert back to bitcoin at 1.0 x BTCUSD. How infinitesimally small is the risk that I would lose my sidechaincoin between the moment and which they're making that offer and how long it would take me to convert back? What's more if I hold sidechaincoin at all it must be because I see some marginal utility in it above just holding Bitcoin.
I would argue that prices would deviate by very small amounts, but it's interesting to think about.
@_date: 2014-05-01 21:18:48
Does using USD bills make you look "guilty by association"?
Edit: not strong enough. As a non-US citizen, the US govt has no business knowing anything about my money, let alone controlling its transfer. And yet today they do, because they enforce their control over all banking flows worldwide. Reason number 1 I want bitcoin. I am a citizen of one country (accident of birth), live in a second, and bank in a third. The government of the country I live in may have a claim over controlling my behaviour, but nobody has any right to control how I transfer money. Money is not money if it has memory. Bitcoin represents the first time in my life I ever had actual money, in that sense. Cash comes very close, but it is issued by governments. Bitcoin is better.
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:56:28
I think there is an inevitability to the fact that a lot of people are going to be *somewhat* sloppy in their initial setup; that's because there's so much to get used to when you start using BTC. Different wallets, how transactions and fees work, how exchanges work or localbitcoins. How the whole protocol works. It's a ton to learn.
So there's that messy initial phase. I for one have three different wallets on my machine, two I never really used.
What I find less forgivable is, once you've got any meaningful amount of money in your wallets, if you don't *then* get it figured out seriously. So sure, your first wallet might be unencrypted or sitting in the cloud, but you **take your bitcoins out of that and put it into something secure**!

But this was exactly the problem that sidechains were designed to solve.
Adam Back's idea was that innovation is difficult on Bitcoin itself because of all the investment in it, but if some people were able to *voluntarily* move their Bitcoin to a sidechain to try out a new feature, they could do so without having any detrimental effect on the rest of the network.
A concrete example might be: if someone creates a sidechain with better anonymity, I'd be happy to move a few bits there during the early 'beta phase'. Everyone gets to play with smaller amounts, but you could still have something at realistic scale, move coins on and off the chain to make sure that part is working OK, and eventually if it matures and seems stable enough, people start using it for real.
No need to create a new 'coin' with all the pump and dump and insecurity shenanigans of altcoins.

@_date: 2014-03-16 13:56:13
This is an interesting argument that's been brought up (although wasn't the calculation coming to $50 per transaction rather than per coin?), but in my opinion it's wrong - because the creation of new coins occurs according to a fixed schedule that was set from the beginning. So I don't see that it actually makes sense to associate the coinbase transaction with the other transactions in the block. The inflation cost is factored in from the start of the process, because it's known. My transaction of 1mBTC today is not really associated with the 25BTC reward.
I agree it's interesting to think about though - exactly what amount of value or energy should be or is required for the creation of the money in circulation? And how much work is really required to process transactions? 
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:58:11
On security:
I think you're looking at things too statically, and perhaps with too narrow a view also. Consider:
* People in Cyprus no longer consider bank deposits truly safe
* People in many third world countries have seen confiscation, bank lockdowns, rampant inflation
* People in many areas see the security of banks as getting worse
* Security of bitcoins is clearly very difficult and it's amateur hour - but is improving rapidly
On fractional reserve:


what would Audit the Coinbase reveal? Like I said, depositors could demand signatures for the full amount of the reserve at regular intervals (even every day), proving ownership. 
There are lots of new technical and practical possibilities but I think they all revolve around these two points - the relative ease with which users can take their bitcoins out from a bitcoin bank and keep them personally + the inability of said banks/central banks to print bitcoins will keep any such institutions honest.

I read that page. It does not explicitly state whether international shipping is possible. It *could* reasonably be interpreted to mean that international shipping is not possible (that's how I'd read it), but there is no reason whatsoever not to be explicit.

You are not the only site who is lax in this regard, it is a common source of annoyance; many sites, especially but not only US ones, either don't give this information clearly or hide it several clicks away from the front page, or in tiny font in the corner.

As I recall with Bitpay it's sub (or ~) 1%, and you can also go with a fixed monthly fee irrespective of number of transactions (which would only be worthwhile if you had a lot of transactions, but could drag the percentage much closer to zero). Compared with 2.5-3% and even much higher sometimes, for CCs.
Then you're just receiving dollars and Bitpay takes care of the hassle of the Bitcoin price volatility, and the hassle of protecting against double spends (the transaction processes instantly).
You also don't have to wait a month or whatever it is for a CC transaction to be cleared, no hassle with potential fraud (because Bitcoin is digital *cash*).
When you do the analysis carefully, it makes a lot of sense to accept Bitcoin via a payment processor, even if you don't really want the hassle of dealing with Bitcoin itself (although maybe you should!).

This is the core misconception I'm seeing again and again. Suppose I have 100 btc. I choose to put 0.1 btc onto a sidechain which is designed to implement an experimental form of .. say micropayments. I do so *in full awareness that my 0.1 btc is at risk* due to the experimental nature of the sidechain. I may lose that 0.1 btc; the concept is that the value of 1 btc in general is still founded on the algorithm and sound crypto of the main chain.
Saying that doing this is "an attack on the principle that gives Bitcoin value" makes as much sense as saying that burning 0.1 btc is an attack on the principle that gives Bitcoin value. If anything, it gives Bitcoin more value since more of them are going to be lost (not to mention of course that the potential of more functionality could give Btc tremendously more value in the long term).

Well, gold is never actually *consumed* (ignoring nuclear reactions). It makes no sense to compare it to oil; with oil, it's the energy content that makes it valuable, and that energy actually gets consumed.
(This is why people talking about "peak oil" and "peak copper" in the same breath are either obfuscating or themselves not understanding).
The usual reaction I get to this observation is "recovering used gold or copper is very expensive or difficult". But there is a huge difference between an ultimate, theoretical impossibility and a practical difficulty. Recovering used petroleum/gasoline is impossible because it makes no sense - what you *used* was the energy content. You can reconstitute the gasoline, but only by spending even more energy.

This is why we're working on ssl logging techniques to prove bank transfers without revealing bank login credentials. Localbitcoins simply cannot arbitrate such a case.

Well it says 2001-2005.
So yes by any reasonable interpretation it's wrong to say ssh is used more widely than ssl, but of course it's a completely different user group. And I agree that "it's never been exploited" is a bit weird - although it's certainly true that it seems to work surprisingly well.
The question to me is whether there is a way to allow a large group of non-technical users to take responsibility to verify signatures/fingerprints somehow. If the answer is no, then we have to admit TTPs into the architecture and the only question remains is whether the PKI which already exists is the right way. In that case, it's very difficult to argue with you - this is what the market already produced, we are unlikely to do better, at least initially.
On the other hand, the arguments you make in favour of the existing PKI *strongly* imply we should not attempt to do anything like Bitcoin in the first place; because it is extremely difficult for non-technical users to use, and it requires them to take responsibility for keys. What's more, we have detailed evidence to suggest that it doesn't work - look at all the money that's been lost.
I think that perspective's very important here.

Google docs may or may not need to change their setup. What *is* clear, however, is that you should not allow your btc security to rely on the security of online accounts like gmail. Google's document or email service is not responsible for you losing cash via their service.
Don't store significant funds on *any* online service if you don't have to. If you feel you have to, then at least consider the scenario of being hacked - is there insurance (if there is you'd better read the fine print)? Is there a multisig setup, and what exactly does it protect you from? 
Online wallets means centralised services which are magnets for hackers. The owners of these services have the constant tension between doing what is really secure and doing what will gain them the most users, so can't be relied on to make conservative decisions.

Your perspective is based, firstly, on the concept that the one who has total control of the financial network is a benign actor. What happens when China's Unionpay is the default payment network across Eurasia? Do you still think it's OK to have one party in total control of financial flows, blocking it whenever they want to? So that if the politicians in your country decide to have meetings with the Dalai Lama, your local economy could be trashed overnight? (something vaguely similar happened in South Africa - he was denied a visa multiple times due to 'procedural issues').
You can make an argument that in some specific case it is preferable to block flow of funds. For example, in a state like North Korea, perhaps all funds flow through the government and therefore it's impossible to do business there without supporting that regime, and therefore one should stop all trade. Fine. But what you must consider is that concentration of that much power is not only dangerous because, randomly, the people in the possession of that power might be evil, but because the very *existence* of that much concentration of power attracts and creates corruption.
At the end of the day, this is the crypto-anarchy argument all over again. If we create anonymous digital cash, does it mean we're going to get assassination markets. I think it's a question that doesn't go anywhere. Fires destroy homes, we should not develop the technology of fire. Electricity can kill people. P2p messaging on the internet allows a riot to happen in minutes. Etc. Any technology can be used for destructive purposes. Human society gravitates to the use of more powerful technologies over time because those who use them do better than those who don't. At each stage some kind of new social order has to emerge to find the right balance in dealing with them.

This model has been pursued by a lot of people. For example, NashX: 
So far, it hasn't been made to work, and I think there are good reasons for it. The problems are basically to do with (a) you cannot assume that counterparties will act rationally and (b) the possibilities of blackmail, using side channels to communicate and transfer value.
On the other hand, on your technical question "how can we create multisig 2 of 2 transactions"? Well, it's quite easy if you can do some coding (just one example: look up pybitcointools on github and go from there). If you're asking for an existing GUI tool on the web you could use

It is there, if not explicitly:
The reason this is a DOS weakness rather than a different type is that the actual functioning of the protocol is not threatened in any way; there is no way to steal coins.
Exchanges using the protocol in an insecure way may lose coins via this attack (no idea if they have, but I think it's possible, if very stupid in hindsight), but only via being tricked into voluntarily giving out coins that they shouldn't, but that's not the same thing as a protocol weakness.

@_date: 2014-01-31 08:17:42
It seems like you're really asking about how the internet works more than about how the Bitcoin network works. Nodes on the internet are identified by IP addresses. They can open tcp connections with large numbers of other IP addresses, and once the connection is established, can send data over it. 
You're asking about the nature of the connection. Generally you'll establish a connection between IP addresses directly, specifying the port you want to connect to (8333 is standard for Bitcoin, though that doesn't matter). A home PC might have trouble with this if it's behind a NAT (there might be trouble accepting incoming connections), but the key point is that the internet itself was designed to operate in this peer to peer way where any node can *request* a connection to any other node, with IP addresses used as names to identify nodes.
 
So one node, if it wants to broadcast info. to the whole P2P network, can send data to all the other nodes it's connected to. It will (usually dynamically) keep a list of nodes it can connect to / is connected to. Then, depending on the protocol, the receiving nodes may send that info out to all the nodes *they're* connected to. In this way, information can be propagated to hundreds of thousands of nodes in subsecond time very easily.

The short answer is that transactions can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs.
Normally, you'll see two outputs - one of them is the actual payment, and the other is the change. On the other hand inputs are very frequently multiple because a wallet can be sweeping up unspent outputs from lots of different previous transactions. Think of it like counting out all the change (coins) in your physical wallet to spend a dollar.
Many outputs (like in the first case on that page) are less common, but perfectly allowed. It can be someone wanting to make multiple payments at the same time.

The idea is you can send your bitcoins from the main chain into the side chain and use them there. Then whenever you like, you can send them back. 
Like, your main savings are on the main chain, but when you put a few into a side chain specially designed for everyday spending, and you go down to the coffee shop and spend those "everyday coins", which have nice properties like a 1 minute confirmation time (maybe!). Whenever you want to, you can send them back. So it gives your bitcoins the ability to have a whole range of different properties for different scenarios.

Yes, agreed, the argument boils down to "bitcoin cannot work because it doesn't work yet" (although of course, for some applications, where volatility is irrelevant or can be mitigated, it already *does* work).

Yes, I do too. The problem here is that people are too strongly motivated by greed and that's why the solution to everything is perceived to be an altcoin.
(Side note: I was in the thread on btctalk when the guy from the Lakota came along wanting to use crypto. He was initially mostly interested in setting up bitcoin mining. We explained to him that (a) mining is a specialized industry and you probably can't do anything meaningful and (b) he was in a unique position, given the special sovereignty situation, to do something *very* meaningful by creating some kind of exchange business which the government would have no or less right to interfere with. But he wasn't interested in that, he was only interested in mining. A month or two later, and guess what - it's an altcoin, and a joke. It seems less than 5% of people who are interested in cryptocurrencies are still interested when they find out they can't get free money.)
 One day some small independent region or nation is going to realize that there is something meaningful here, and that is the idea of allowing Bitcoin as an official parallel currency (it can't realistically be the exclusive one as of now, the infrastructure is nowhere near sufficiently developed). When that happens, the implications could be profound, and it would likely create very meaningful economic opportunities.

Investments must be "investment grade" rated (AAA) to be allowed into pension portfolios.
The AAA rating must be given by an accredited ratings agency, of which there are only 4, government approved.
The ratings agencies are paid by the issuers of the securities they rate. Ludicrous conflict of interest, but since the government is paid for by lobbying from industry, and the regulators are paid by them directly, indirectly and many ways in between, it is allowed.
Companies create models and reasoning to argue why a bunch of crap is actually AAA (after all, it's an entirely arbitrary concept in the first place).
Ratings agencies approve it because it makes more money for everyone.
Pension funds and similar buy the stuff because it's got a bit more yield (and if it ever blows up, it won't be the fund managers that pay for it - it'll be the "consumers").
Everyone wins! Consumer protection agencies did their job!
This is called "regulatory arbitrage" and it is the worst possible outcome for consumers - in this case consumers of an investment. Consumers are "protected" - they are withheld information, they are withheld options for action (they are not allowed to invest in hedge funds with unorthodox investments (example - shorting subprime!) - unless they are already super-rich). They get robbed blind by the corrupt interplay between governments and corporations. 
The replacement of a market signal by a regulatory body is exactly what actually strips consumers of real protection in the long term. The market has always been and always will be full of people trying to rob and cheat and steal, as well as full of lots of actors with integrity. What is needed is *informed decision making* not regulations which primarily serve powerful interests, while taking away the tiny bit of power that the ordinary person has.
That's how communism led to people going hungry - it removed the market signal.
A final comment - the other aspect of this is the word 'consumer' which I really dislike. Humans protect humans. But I prefer not to be considered as a 'consumer', and when you look at it from that point of view, the concept 'consumer protection' is even rather sinister.

There really is. The functions are very different. If you want fast trading, you need liquidity, which means virtual funds rather than allocated funds.
I'm not saying it's absolutely impossible to combine trading and banking functions. My bank, for example, offers stock trading. But it is expensive and clunky, so I only ever did stock trading from a separate brokerage account. Asking for perfect banking functions and perfect real time trading from the same account, at no meaningful extra cost, is asking to have your cake and eat it.

I kind of agree but have a different perspective: for a long time I've thought that the real value of Bitcoin is as a clearing and settlement mechanism for "high powered" money. The consumer side is going to be subject to all the problems we have today with banking and online commerce, because as you say users are just going to struggle.
But the banking system strains under the weight of its own political power. A completely neutral system like Bitcoin perfectly replaces all the mess of  RTGS, clearing and netting and SWIFT and so on. Those currently in power obviously don't want that because it takes away their ability to confiscate .. so it's not happening this year for sure :) But it really does make so much sense. Maybe one day.
The optimistic view is that Bitcoin is the killer app for public key cryptography (the real stuff, not the bastardised idea of PKI). And that people over time will force themselves to learn how to use it, because of the economic incentive. One can provide catastrophe insurance with cryptographic methods, after all, so human fallibility is not a death blow. That's what I want to believe, but even if it's true, it will probably take a long time.
OK, it's all a guessing game :)

What you describe is simply a wrong implementation of multisig.
Each of the N users should generate their own private keys and then share their public keys in order to generate the multisig address.
Then they can share their *signatures* (not keys) for any transaction to reach an agreement and spend.
Users should never share private keys!
OP should note the limitations: N&gt;3 is non standard in current Bitcoin, but can be done by broadcasting to certain miners, and N&gt;20(not sure, I think this is the number) cannot be used at all.

(Like others, I didn't read it all, but:)


I'm largely with you. I see Bitcoin functioning much better as a replacement for SWIFT than for Starbucks gift cards. The latter has to be implemented as a layer above (edit: too strong; it doesn't *have* to be implemented as a layer above - there are some pretty good arguments for using Bitcoin directly, with no confirmations, in small merchants - but it depends on certain details and in a lot of cases, over time, I feel sure that there will be layers above the raw network used for this kind of transaction); it can be above Bitcoin or above something else. But the industrial strength and dramatically superior security model of Bitcoin makes it by far the best clearing and settlement mechanism the world has ever seen.
At the end of the day I want the consumer facing parts to be built on top of Bitcoin rather than fiat because I can actually *own* the former; I can't ever really own the latter.


Drop the loaded word "Libertarian", but you cannot divorce Bitcoin from the principle of freedom underlying it. Look at how Satoshi described it in Feb 2009 :
"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts."
If you don't see a problem with any of that then why would you bother with something as complex and demanding as a blockchain? If you trust central organizations to govern money, they can use centralized databases much more efficiently.

I think we have a certain definition of 'inflation' that we tend to use here - increase in the money supply. I think the standard textbook definition is different (price level), but the one we use is more the Austrian one. I am not an expert in these things, but that's what I remember.
Meanwhile, can Bitcoin go through hyperinflation - every historical example of hyperinflation in fiat currency happens due to printing of money. Combining this with the previous paragraph, I'm sure you can see why I claim "can't be hyperinflated".
But if you choose the other definition, i.e. inflation in terms of prices, then yes of course Bitcoin can go to zero and therefore to infinite prices.

Sure, good question. The short answer, surprisingly perhaps, is your browser.
Your browser stores a database of certificates, specifically 'CAs' (certificate authorities) which act as trust roots. Then, when you go to abc site, it delivers its cert, your browser checks the cert of abc and sees if that cert has been signed by a CA (oversimplified, but basically). If not, your browser shows one of those huge red warnings "this site is not trusted".

That depends; not necessarily, in the case of property transfer, as Bitcoin has proved - signatures provide ID verification in the sense of proving ownership of a secret. That's because Bitcoin's requirement is only for *continuity of identity*, not for tying identity to something external to the system. Bitcoin identities/pseudonyms only exist within the system. Voting requires making a leap to some outside object.


We were discussing specifically the application to voting. The problem here is that without some external check (i.e. a centralized party), you can create false votes if you can create false biological identities, or make copies of other people's.

Yeah, they just set up a fake site with domain name blockchann.info or similar, and they get an ssl cert for it. The red flag in the OP's description is self-signed - that means no CA is vouching for their legitimacy (of course, if you actually read the domain name, that'd be a moot point really..)
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:55:54
Public key cryptography wouldn't work like that. Think of a hash function as a perfectly one-way function, whereas a public/private key pair creates a function which is one way for everyone except those who have the key. 
So to make a signature, you take a message m, hash it to make it easier to work with - h(m). Then you encrypt it with the private key. The receiver holds the public key and so can decrypt, getting back h(m). Since the receiver also has the message, he can perform h(m) and verify he gets the same hash. Anyone holding the public key can do the same.
No such decryption process is possible using only hash functions. So the best you could do is send out a hash of your message with the message, which is pointless because anyone could have done that. A digital signature verifies that only someone holding the specific private key associated with your public key could have created the signature.

I love this chain of comments. Exactly.
Bitcoin combines physical scarcity (energy resource) with digital transparency and transferrability. You don't have to rely on the powerful central counterparties to hold the store of wealth (even if you want to offload responsibility to them, you can still have cryptographic verification). That's why it's a revolutionary technology.

Using a blockchain for proving data existence is not generally going to involve private keys.
For example proof of prior art (to prevent patents) or property deeds. This kind of data is not snoopable after hashing (too big and complex) and so one would just "post" the data into the blockchain with a dummy transaction. There is no worry about private keys here because even if the private key used to make that transaction was stolen, it would only affect future transactions on that key; the earlier transaction remains for all time and for all to see.
If there is an issue with this suggestion, it's to do with privacy, not hacking private keys.

And how exactly do you verify location? Location can be spoofed. If you insist on data being spread out over wide areas, it will be spoofed that way.
About noise and accuracy, I don't know where you're going there. Say we're measuring temperature. The whole point of the exercise is to get a spread of real measurements, there is no way to distinguish between 100 real measurements in some area and 3 or 4 real measurements plus 96 fake measurements created from the real measurements with some random variation.

There's two elements to it; first, decentralisation means no concentration of funds, and nothing for an external attacker to attack. Multisig is used as part of the solution, of course. Second, the nature of the trust is indeed critical. If it's just "trust me", then sure - a centralised party is better than a random peer. But it's not; arbitration is used, with a pool of arbitrators. See the bitsquare documents for how this is planned to be set up. 
Also see  for some discussion of a novel (objective) form of arbitration disputes w.r.t bank transactions. To be clear, this is a separate project from bitsquare, and bitsquare is not dependent on it, but we are working together.

Well, probably it's a good amount of entropy. But you'd better be sure you know the right way to convert it into a private key without any gotchas.

I like Adam Back's point: the internet scales 'flat' because it's a point to point protocol. Bitcoin is a broadcast protocol. You can't just build layers on top of the Bitcoin network and expect it to work fine. Every message has to be sent to everyone. Therefore side chains. Or maybe tree chains, if anyone understands how that works.
And yes, merged mining, I don't know how it's going to work either. Have there been any "official" updates about side chains in the last few months? I haven't seen them.

If you can't convert from sidechain coin back to btc then it's not a sidechain.
If you can, then the sidechain version of bitcoin will never have a higher value due to arbitrage. 
It's like saying: this safe is not large enough to contain more than a million dollars in cash. Therefore, the cash in the safe is not fungible with other dollars.
(What I hadn't thought about before your post though - does it make any sense to say the sidechain can limit how much comes in? I would guess it does in the sense that the code could be written that way, where the sidechain honours SPV proofs until it considers itself 'full'. I mean, I think this would be a terrible idea and nobody would want to use it, but maybe it's at least possible).
Either way it doesn't matter to the concept of the OP. Limiting what sidechain coins can exist in some way does not alter the supply of BTC.
Your point about miners is not correct because there is no coin minting going on in the sidechain. As long as sidechains are using bitcoins via a 2 way peg, the only way for a miner to get block rewards is to be on the main chain. The problem, if there is one, with sidechains is the other way round: to create a good incentive mechanism for anyone to mine the sidechain (or to have merge mining work effectively).

The key element to successful security, imo, is to generate the seed for your main wallet on a disk and OS which are clean (new and never touched the internet).
Of course doing this is a bit inconvenient (although there are more convenient ways), but this only needs to be done for the relatively serious, bigger amount that you might plan to keep for savings.
For smaller, everyday payments you can keep a separate wallet, such as a wallet on a mobile phone or on a desktop or even a web wallet of some type.
The savings wallet seed phrase is kept ultra safe backed up, probably on paper but in any case nowhere near your everyday normal work computer so it's inaccessible to hackers.
Another important principle is to try every step out with small amounts first.
Lots of other details will depend on people's preferences, and you can learn bits and pieces over time. Don't rush.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:14:53
I think you can come up with a better counterargument :) How about this - the US govt doesn't guarantee in an *absolute* sense any particular value for 1 USD, but it does guarantee, or claims to, that the value will be relatively stable. As I recall one of the mandates of the Federal Reserve is to ensure price stability.
I still think I'm right though, both in an absolute sense, and in a long term sense (USD lost 95%+ of its value since the Fed's creation).

We told him when he came asking about Bitcoin on btctalk, but he wouldn't listen: 
Just like all the other people who lose interest in Bitcoin when they find out they can't print it themselves. The sad thing was there *might* have been a real opportunity there (leveraging sovereignty to create financial institutions, or at least businesses).
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:22:01
There are two competing factors to include in the answer:
* A market panic is a flight to cash. Bitcoin is not *yet* anywhere near as good a cash as dollars, because it cannot be traded as easily for other things. On this basis, Bitcoin would suffer heavily in a market panic.
* The incentive to flight to cash is only there for people who have a lot of non-cash but still liquid assets (stocks primarily). Thus the flight to cash is primarily something done by rich people with broad portfolios (factor in of course that the more wealth a person is, the more impact they have on the market). The average Bitcoiner right now is not in that category; they may be relatively wealthy, but *most* of the people in Bitcoin are not the type who have large portfolios of stocks, bonds etc (and there are basically no big institutions like banks or hedge funds in Bitcoin).
I would say the latter is more important, and that Bitcoin might not suffer much. Whether people would actually panic *in* to Bitcoin would depend on the nature of the financial crisis; if it was something Cyprus-like, then clearly that *could* happen (even then it's not guaranteed).

Hmm. As I understood it from the explanation, every coin on the sidechain is permanently swappable for a coin on the main chain, meaning there is no reason to price them differently. I guess they would be priced differently in practice, if measured against a third currency (like USD), since some risk of catastrophic failure of the sidechain would be priced in. I guess.
As for magic gain of flexibility, of course; if  you want to use the side chain, you have to take the risk of transferring your coins into it, but only for the time you want to use them for that purpose. At the end, you have either spent them, or transferred them back into the main chain (envisioning the main chain as being the preferable one for savings).

True, and that's fair enough. Who says that this is something that has to be catalyzed by the average Joe?
Bitcoin already *was* catalyzed by decidedly atypical geek drug users/dealers, and gamblers.
In the future, other catalysts might relate to: international trade/small business, capital flight, world travellers, prediction markets, or .. who knows.
Bitcoin doesn't necessarily have to capture the mass market to work well, it can serve smaller (in size, not importance) groups.


Yes, I often think of this example, but it makes my point as well as yours: torrenting has not died out; I would bet it goes on more now than it did 5-10 years ago. It is very much alive. The difference is that a lot of people in the US and similar countries just went over to the convenient paid service (although a lot also just went straight to the paid service because they were never techy enough to go in for P2P), while a lot of new people, e.g. in less developed economies took their place.

This was my first thought too, and I agree that the article seems to overlook the point that banks ledgers are not so primitive as to have a CPOF. However, given the real time nature of modern banking, you could imagine a powerful attack causing serious headaches in some scenarios.

This really doesn't need to happen. I have made (one very minor) contribution to the Electrum project so I'll take a look and see if there's any good reason why high tx fees wouldn't get a warning. I can't think of one.
Another thing you can do is switch to mBTC, I find it's helpful. However, be very careful to get the number of decimal places right in the transitional period.

No, no. It's not about how smartly some analysts at a bank can assess Bitcoin. It's that there is an apparatus of control, a nexus of power between banks and politicians, that acts constantly to keep its control over money. Of course, Bitcoin is only just on their radar, it's still very small. But regulations like that produced by Lawsky, or the endless flow of shut down accounts at banks for Bitcoin businesses and even Bitcoin users, happens for a reason, even if it isn't a conspiracy.
It's nothing to do with assessing the business case. Bitcoin remains hard to interface with other financial services and systems because it not in "their" interest to help anything which doesn't tick the boxes (i.e. their total control of the flow of money). And in contrast to the ideal of a legal system, in finance, anything which is not explicitly legal is *de facto* illegal, including sending bits and bytes over a wire and calling it money.

You're right, and yet still you don't get the real point.

I'm with you really; I think people are too aggressive about trying to shut down innovation in crypto. I mean, do we really all want to use NSA defined standards? At the same time, we have to have our eyes open - innovating with crypto is like playing with a chemistry set containing polonium-210. 
But it's definitely worth observing that Satoshi didn't do this (use novel cryptographic primitives), and certainly it seems like a wise decision (well, OK - maybe just obvious rather than wise). Defining bitcoin scripts so you could have different transaction types than just Alice pays Bob was already quite ambitious (cough, Ethereum).

Now: 
that's a difficult call to make. Even to the extent that it's true that 'most' of the trading is being done on Chinese exchanges, you have to consider that it costs zero to make a trade on some exchanges, so a pure volume analysis can be misleading. The market is very fragmented, much more so than in, say, crude oil futures that are only traded on the NYMEX or certain other fixed regulated exchanges. Bitcoin has a lot of p2p or otc trading because nobody can really stop people from doing that, and it's difficult to measure what's really happening.

Centralisation gives efficiencies but decentralisation can give resilience. There will still be centralisation; another fun fact is that Bitcoin, like all currencies, represents centralization itself - just like any other currency. The idea of crypto-anarchy is that the centralization can be abstracted away from physical locality, removing violence (which current legal systems are based on) from commerce. Open Bazaar and Open Transactions are examples of visions of how this might work. Current darknet markets are a step in that direction, but don't go quite far enough in that they try to create anonymity for users but current incarnations mostly don't remove the physical nature of the centralization (single server, single operator, single wallet etc.)
TLDR Markets don't have to have a *physical* center.

More usage (adoption), defined as more buying bitcoin and then exchanging them for goods, has no effect, theoretically, on price, but that's a superficial analysis. What drives price long term is holding bitcoins for future expenditures, but that itself will be supported by people perceiving that, in future, there will be a broader array of goods available for purchase with bitcoins, and that in future, bitcoin prices will go up or at least not go down very much (i.e. hold value). Like everything in economics it's a mess of feedback loops, which is one reason it's so hard to build good economic models (nearly impossible in my view).
The comparison with TVs doesn't work at all; TVs got cheaper because they became cheaper to produce due to technological advantages and economies of scale as production ramped up and competition took effect. While it may become cheaper or (so far!) more expensive to produce bitcoins in terms of electricity and dollar cost, the rate of production is not going to change. Even more importantly, the rate of production is predictable far in advance, which makes it completely unlike the production of other goods. The market price of bitcoins is theoretically entirely unaffected by the production rate (e.g. the halving event shouldn't matter) because people already know it's going to happen.

It's not that people like me don't get your point; it's clear enough. It's that there's another side to this argument, which is, don't buy into their narrative. Just as the sheeple are indeed scared off by certain terms, they are also subconsciously tuned in to signals of power. Calling something a black market, let's say, just out in the open, is a way of saying "we don't have to fear any more". Obviously that's not completely true - but it's a signal of how the world is changing, and it seeps into people's minds.

This is a common misconception. P2SH multisig transactions (which are the type that people actually use) can satisfy IsStandard() with n &gt; 3. For example 3 of 4 is fine. You hit the limit of 500 bytes on the scriptSig first, so you can't get anywhere near 16 of 16 as standard, but you can certainly do 3 of 4 and 3 of 5 type of thing. Only after you exceed that 500 byte limit do you have to go to non-standard mining like Eligius.

I was just suggesting two different extra attack surfaces: one, friends who knew about it (very unlikely but only you can know) and two, someone having access over the school network. The latter would need for them to have put some kind of keylogger or something on your machine though if, as you say, you used wallet encryption properly and never leaked the password.
To be honest, none of that seems remotely likely though, if all the information you gave is accurate (especially how long it's been since you used the coins - that's the part I find most mysterious).
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:57:22
He's right, it is a badly conceived question if not actually ambiguous, because the address is completely defined by the public key.
Edit: just remembered that there are multisig addresses, which are not just the hash of a public key. So, either way, the pedantic answer is the right one. So I withdraw my criticism (except perhaps 'key of an asymmetric encryption' is unfortunate since no encryption is going on..)

Meshnets. Radio broadcast. Encryption. Steganography.
The internet is very difficult to shut down in its entirety without destroying civilisation. And anything less than a total shutdown probably won't work (see the above methods, plus probably others I couldn't think of immediately).
It's an architectural principle, I don't know what it's called but - something which requires only the spread of information to function will always be stronger than something that requires censorship. It will always win in the end.
Edit: maybe it just comes from the laws of thermodynamics (which are really statistical laws): information cannot help but spread. OK, that's a bit muddled, but it's something like that :)

Superb article, right on point. I totally agree that the true exit is not in external structures like seasteading, but a kind of steganographic exit - continuing to play by the rules, but using the hacker mentality to redefine and subvert the meaning of our actions. In other words, creation of new network structures right within the existing old hierarchies, organised in such a way that they cannot be clearly seen let alone controlled. That's why I am not greatly excited by ideas like the Free State project or Galt's Gulch or charter cities in Honduras. The exit will be in the information space, not the physical one.
As Cody Wilson put it, "A system is approaching perfection - just in time for our disappearance".

Honestly, if you want some advice, it would be a good idea to set up a little web wallet with something like Blockchain.info just for the heck of it. Getting a little bit of Bitcoin is something I'd advise anyone to do, just to find out about it.
Some people will want to pay in Bitcoin for privacy issues. I guess you knew that already. 
Also worth mentioning you can buy a lot more with Bitcoin now than you could a year ago. Flights, hotels, home goods (Overstock) and electronics/computers (like Dell for example or newegg). There are even ways to spend it on groceries.
But going into it properly, from a business perspective, would take a lot more research/effort I guess. So I see why you're not enthused.

Yes and no. It's a lot more binary than people seem to be thinking. As long as a sidechain is functioning correctly, it will be impossible for the price of bitcoins on the sidechain to be significantly different from the price on the main chain, because the coins are fungible between the chains. If however there is meaningful evidence (rumours wouldn't really be enough) that a sidechain's "bridge" to main chain is not functioning, then its price will drop drastically.
The reason I say "rumours aren't enough" is because if I hear a rumour that there's a problem with my sidechain coins, and I find them plausible, I can just try to move my coins back onto main chain. What I wouldn't do, however, is sell them to someone else for 0.9 or 0.8 times as many main chain coins, or equivalent in USD, because I can get a ~1.0 price by just moving them back.

You don't need to create wallet backups on USB, except to avoid losing transaction labels. You only need the seed phrase to recover your money.
The seed phrase allows you to regenerate the wallet, but if anyone else gets the wallet, they have the Bitcoins - **unless** you have encrypted the wallet with a password for spending, which of course you should.
The password encrypts the wallet - it controls the ability to spend. The seed phrase controls the ability to recover the wallet. So let's consider three things: wallet, seed phrase, password:
Attacker gets:
1. Wallet only - no dice, it's encrypted
2. Wallet and password - they win
3. Seed phrase (only, or + anything, doesn't matter) - they win
4. Password only - no dice, useless without the wallet
I *think* I covered all the bases there; please correct any errors.

Yeah, to be fair there are always other scams :) Human beings are fallible after all. 
Mt Gox is actually a good example - they didn't read the Bitcoin blockchain properly, and ended up giving hackers extra money (at least that's the current story). You could similarly imagine a hacker tricking a merchant into believing they'd received the funds when they hadn't. That's very easy to avoid if you use the internet properly.
It's just your original framing that made me say 'logically impossible'. If an irreversible payment *has actually been received* then there can be no scam. Unless maybe you give the money back :)

No, you have to multiply it up to be integers. So, in your example 4 out of 5 would give the same effect.
4 out of 5 works fine; M of N with M and N up to 15 is accepted by the network based on recent updates to the code, although at the top end there may be some issues with getting the tx mined quickly (as not everyone is up to date).

If you can't trust what's being presented to you by an ssl enabled website, then you can't trust anything really. There is nothing any wallet software can do to deal with that. It's not a bitcoin problem; in theory you could be presented with different information to trick you into doing anything; giving up personal info to hackers when you thought you were giving it to a trusted company, credit card info etc.
It does further highlight though the issue that Bitcoin is electronic *cash* and not reversible.

Hmm. Not really. Bitcoin uses ECDSA (about as standard as you get) for signatures with a fairly obscure, but still known curve. For hashing it uses SHA2 (it doesn't get more standard than that), plus ripe-md (which is not used so much, but was a pre-existing algo, and anyway it's not a very important element). The innovation in Bitcoin is all in the system design, not the crypto primitives.

The advantage of something like tlsnotary is that you can have a situation where there is no evidence available to banks of *why* you made that particular transaction, so there's no reason for them to block it.
Obviously it's more complicated than that, but worth thinking about. My earliest motivation was: let's make it impossible for a bank to infer the reason for the wire transfer, so that to stop the exchange of wire transfer for BTC would require them blanket-banning all wire transfer.
@_date: 2014-03-16 14:47:20
Sure you can look at it from that point of view, but the OP said "unnecessary energy consumption to mine". It is clearly not "unnecessary" - it's necessary for the intended, stated goal, which is a currency with no central trust point(s).
On the other hand, if you *do* look it at from that point of view - that decentralization is an adjustable parameter - why bother with a blockchain at all?
@_date: 2014-09-15 17:06:28


I still can't quite get my head round people interpreting seignorage as a fee on all transactions. As I've said before - do you add the $50 billion or so per month of QE over the last year proportionately as a fee on all USD transactions? It doesn't matter whether that works out as a small fee or a large fee, the point is - you would never do it, because it's ridiculous.
A reduction in the seignorage from 25BTC, to 12.5BTC and beyond affects how much electricity cost can go into mining, which affects the break even point for mining activity, and thus in principle the difficulty (of course you have to factor in the long term real value changes of 1BTC), so it's very difficult to predict long term how lower coinbase reward will affect bitcoin mining diff (and therefore bitcoin security .. and I'm not even trying to factor in how ASIC innovation plays in). But just saying "25BTC has to be added to transaction cost" is ridiculous on its face.
From an economics perspective it makes no sense to suppose the 25BTC reward affects anything at all, as it's a known in advance cost, not an "innovation" as I think some economists like to put it.
I do understand that the block size limits means transactions are (at least for now) a scarce resource; but the dynamics of the bitcoin system mean that adding more mining power does not help with (or hinder) this problem - the whole point of the difficulty ratchet is to make the absolute amount of hash power irrelevant to bitcoin's internal operation. Obviously that is not perfectly true, but that's the baseline model.
Bitcoin is *profoundly* less expensive than credit card transactions, although the vast majority of the advantage is going to be seen by merchants for now - for consumers (for now) the advantage is mainly in a better security model.
@_date: 2014-12-08 08:57:35
I've had this argument with someone before :)
Yes, a signature is an 'encryption' of the hash - although of course note that you're encrypting with the private key and the verifier decrypts with the public key, the opposite way round to normal.
But the point is that to call this encryption is highly misleading, since the message itself is not hidden. You can claim to be technically correct in saying that encryption is being used (although I don't even agree with that), but the only result is to completely mislead and confuse those people that don't know the technical details.

Hmm. The "benefits of being centralized"? Really?
"As easy as possible" - multisig is trivial to implement and will have no impact on user experience in a normal buying situation. But then again I don't know the details of your model. Perhaps in your reference to taint you're saying that there needs to be mixing and multisig makes that more complex?
In my opinion multisig will have to be implemented by such markets, anything where the central party holds spending power over funds is just never going to work long term.

It's not a completely academic distinction. If you use Bitcoin as a lot of the core devs recommend, which is to never reuse addresses, then you'll never be giving out addresses for payment receipt for which the pubkey is known.

It's a good question. I think there were two things going on in the late 80s to early 90s period that were both hugely significant, one much more in the public eye than the other. The internet and then the web were fairly prominent in the media and public consciousness from some time in the early 90s, while at the same time much more quietly there was the crypto war going on (PGP and export controls etc.). The latter was far more politically charged than the former. Spreading information clearly had political significance but Western society is fundamentally an open society (a lot of Asian power centres still pretty much hate it today). Until the internet was combined with encryption, the powers that be weren't averse to it as it gave them, also, another angle of attack. Once encryption kicked in fully in the 00s we started getting complaints about "going dark" and a lot of dirty tricks as revealed by Snowden.
So you could say Bitcoin is a very different matter politically - it strikes at the very heart of centralized power structures.  And that's why Satoshi is anonymous and why he disappeared.
But it might be more accurate to say that Bitcoin was the completion of the whole project (as best laid out by Timothy May in his cryptoanarchy description), and that's why the full political nature is exposed only now. It's the combination of anonymous e-cash with encryption and decentralised communication which puts the final nail in the coffin of control.
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:55:53

Actually there probably isn't much argument here. I'm not arguing against corporations' use of bitcoin, nor arguing that big corporations are evil, only that we don't need to campaign for it (and shouldn't expect it to happen quickly). There are problems with pushing for it - first, Bitcoin cannot handle a large transaction load yet, and second - existing payment solutions work very well for consumers in first world countries interacting with large corporations. Advantages are marginal, and there may be some disadvantages, so let's not spend our energy on campaigning for it. If every talking head and discussion point in the media related to Bitcoin is about this, we will lose the argument, and rightly so. This is energy directed in the wrong direction imo.


This is a core underlying principle of bitcoin; read the first page of the whitepaper and the message in the genesis block.

It seems that you want financial advice from economists. These people told us that the housing market was fine in 2006 and that "subprime is contained" in 2007/8. Economics has very limited practical value; it is mostly a political discipline. What it certainly will not do is tell you anything about the future evolution of markets. 
Other commenters have suggested that most economists are not capable of understanding bitcoin. That is probably more true than not, to be honest.
Here's a good example, from Tyler Cowen (


But then the QuitCoin company comes along, with its algorithm, offering to sell you QuitCoin for $400.  Will you ever accept such an offer?  Well, QuitCoin is “cheaper,” but of course it may buy you less on the other side of the transaction as well.  The QuitCoin merchants realize this, and so they have built deflationary pressures into the algorithm, so you expect QuitCoin to rise in value over time, enough to make you want to hold it.  So you buy some newly minted QuitCoin for $400, and its price springs up pretty quickly,  at which point you buy the drugs with it.
The author goes on to develop this entirely idiotic argument further. But the basis is inane - there is no meaning in the dollar value of 1 Bitcoin because 1 Bitcoin is an arbitrary unit. It's like saying it's rational to prefer centimetres to inches because inches are bigger. As if that wasn't enough, his arguments ignore hashing power and network effect.

You are missing a crucial point: digital items *do not have this unforgeability natively* unlike physical items.
That's what makes the analysis of utility a bit tricky: it's not an additive sum of properties, the interaction between the properties counts too. 
Digital things have enormously useful properties (transfer at speed of light for example), but no value, realistically (as media industries are finding out to their chagrin), due to ease of copying. Adding unforgeability into the mix and suddenly the equation can totally change.

You mean more than 15? Well, 520 bytes is apparently a hard limit on the redeemscript portion (the M pubkey pubkey .. N OP_CHECKMULTISIG). From what the core devs told me, that isn't going to change (although I don't think I understood why). And you can't fit more than 15 compressed pubkeys into that.
At some point (I don't know where) the computational costs of verifying all the signatures becomes a problem. I don't know whether that will be relevant at 20 pubkeys or 200. (And in this it's important to note something that James didn't mention in the video - the order of pubkeys matters - precisely because if you were allowed to throw them in in any order it would greatly increase the cost of verification, as Bitcoin would have to run through all possible combinations of signatures and pubkeys to figure it out).

The game theoretic approach, using 2 of 2 multisig, basically just doesn't work at an incentive level. Back in early 2013 the NashX people brought the idea to the Btctalk forum and there was a lot of interest. The project later died out, from what I can tell (the website exists but I don't see trading). That example proves nothing of course, but I maintain that the fundamental idea is unsound. We talked a bit about it in this thread also:   
Consider the situation after both parties have committed deposits/collateral. Whether the seller delivers the goods or not, the buyer controls 1 of 2 keys to the funds. The decision about how the funds are disbursed from that account is entirely a matter of negotiation between the parties. It's true that the incentives alter after the goods are delivered, but only in subjective ways that can't really be measured. The collateral payments are sunk costs at this point, and so also irrelevant.
You can attempt to create a cryptographic lock so that the only outputs are (buyer gets 0, seller gets full btc amount), (buyer gets 0, seller gets 0) (or similar) - that certainly makes it *practically* more difficult for a corrupt buyer to engage in negotiation (or blackmail if you prefer). But the incentive/game theory aspects trump the cryptography here, because it will always be possible for the buyer to open up a dialog with the seller in order to discuss off-channel offsetting payments (attempting to enforce perfect anonymity between participants can help with this problem (although not completely eliminate it), but is tremendously difficult to achieve perfectly and such attempts would largely destroy market functionality). 
Notice also that in the anonymous case, the users have to rely on counterparties acting as *rational* agents when they know nothing about them; in other words, they have to assume that every human being acts rationally. Not a recipe for success.
Notice that none of these problems *necessarily* arise with payment for purely digital goods with can be cryptographically locked. In that case you can arrange for an atomic transaction in which the goods are unlocked by the payment. But for a trade (crypto)&lt;--&gt;(physical goods or fiat or other goods based on trusted entities) I don't believe the 2 of 2 approach is sound.

It's not a question to me of whether a cash based payment system (push only as you put it) is better or worse than a pull system. It's a question of voluntary choice. People hold bank accounts under the assumption that it's a cash-like instrument, i.e. that the contents of the account really *belong* to them, but they are being duped. To the banks, the contents of your account are merely a liability, an IOU. Bottom line, they *will* confiscate (i.e. refuse to honour the IOU) when it suits them, and the horrible truth is that the law supports and encourages this practice, because the government and its agencies want total control over your finances, and today they largely have it.
There is nothing wrong with a pull based system, a centralised system where a TTP is fully in charge, creating convenience and security. I have no problem with direct debits, if it's a choice. What isn't acceptable is when we have no opt-out of this big-brother-knows-best model.
I agree with you that a lot of people here are not thinking clearly about this stuff. I've often tried to argue that 'Be your own bank' is a dumb slogan for Bitcoin. That's not practical for most people. It's great that Bitcoin exists as a choice today, however imperfect, but most people need to be cautious with it.

Interesting point: if the price of a currency *rises* too much, a central bank can easily correct that. But if the price of a currency *falls* too much, what is that central bank supposed to do? Ultimately, they will be powerless.

Everyone would be happy to see Wall St money come in, if it is unconditional. The problem is that Wall St is connected to the political establishment, and cannot start trading Bitcoins on the NYMEX or something. If Wall St money means things like coinvalidation, Bitcoin will die, believe me. People will just hard fork or switch to a coin without these regulatory "features", because it's precisely the features which prevent the ability to regulate which makes Bitcoin of any interest.
A regulated Bitcoin is a bitcoin without fungibility, with middlemen, without ultra low transfer fees, without the ability to transact freely across political boundaries. That is not of any interest to anyone economically.

Yes, it is programmable digital cash. But it has no credit mechanism. You can build a "bitcoin bank" as in a bank which deals in bitcoin. It could even make bitcoin loans, charging interest in bitcoin. It could pay interest on deposits in bitcoin. But that function - credit - would be another layer above, just as it's another layer above deposits today in US dollars.
Clearly bitcoin and the technologies around it could, and probably will, create very different types of financial institutions, for example using proof of reserve, and using multisignature to create new security options. But Bitcoin *itself* doesn't replace the bank - in the literal sense of an average person taking all their savings out of a bank and putting it in (even a cold storage) wallet, it was never designed to do that. It was designed as cash.
Some people *might* use it like that, as a souped-up, improved version of putting money under a mattress. It's not even a crazy idea; but it's an idea that will only apply to a very small proportion of people (90+% would fail at keeping it safe, as in fact many have been doing consistently throughout the early years of btc).

The new difficulty is calculated by looking at how long the last N blocks took to be mined on average (N is about 2000 iirc). So the faster blocks are getting mined, the more the difficulty ratchets up and vice versa. That's the mechanism used to keep the average block time at around 10 minutes.

Agree with the first paragraph but not at all with the last. A bitcoin audit can achieve real transparency using the blockchain, and with certain more cutting edge cryptography (ZKP for example, perhaps FHE also) there may in future be outstanding quality audits without the need for release of commercially sensitive information.
Audits in the current/legacy system are ultimately a game of 'he said she said', and what's worse is that what is being audited is in some sense not real, because fiat money is IOUs all the way down.

There's a game theoretic aspect to this. Bittorrent (for copyrighted files) is thoroughly illegal in the US but still widely used. Every country which *tries* to ban bitcoin suffers not only from the potential loss of business should it take off and be successful, but also because even the partial failure of such a ban will expose their powerlessness to stop it. People in authority hate to look weak (that is not a criticism, it's exactly as it must be), so they are careful not to make proclamations which might fail. 
Any one government may temporarily succeed in preventing people from trading bitcoin for A,B and C, but if it turns out that it's still easy to trade it for D and E then almost nothing is lost. Example: it may be illegal to trade USD for BTC, but if it's still easy to trade it for rubles or rupees or yuan or yen, then the ban has far less value, not least because it is *very* easy to trade yen for dollars, say. 
Don't forget how large a proportion of the world market is black or grey (and that's certainly true outside of the US/EU), so what the law states is only peripherally important in some parts of the world.
Of course, a US ban would be huge news today and bitcoin would plummet in currency terms. But look at the big picture and it may only be a blip. I know it's hard to imagine, but incentives always trump laws over time.

If the restarted amount of hashing wasn't at least comparable with the former amount, a block wouldn't be found for a long time either.
Important to understand that if the miners stopped only over a long period, rather than all at once, there wouldn't be a big problem (but it would have to be a long period like months, not hours - difficulty is reset every 2000ish blocks). Well, as long as at least one miner remained :)

It's an inherent property of the currency.
Bitcoin is digital cash, meaning payment is both immediate and final, no intermediaries. That's what makes it a magnet for scammers. Other *electronic* payment methods don't have that property. It's also one property that makes it attractive to non-scammers (e.g. merchants).

Isn't the issue here that you are releasing the coins based on a receipt, instead of releasing the coins only when you see the funds in your account.

The problem is really centralization, as always.
In Forex (or stock trading? or both) they have the concept of 'bucket shops', where the broker is basically taking the other side of your bet. This creates a conflict of interest. In principle, a broker can be properly 'passing through' all trades onto the "real" market, so you're trading with the other participants in the market, rather than your broker. To make sure this is happening, you require someone/regulators enforcing that this is happening, which is ... imperfect at best. 
Bottom line, you constantly have this third party trust issue until and unless you create cryptographically enforceable/verifiable peer to peer trade. I personally wouldn't touch these bitcoin trading sites with a ten foot pole *except* to the extent you can use them to buy and sell larger quantities quickly and then get out.

My point is in this concept of "risk". Look at Operation Choke Point. Look at Chinese capital controls, or Iranian sanctions. You can argue all day about whether certain kinds of controls on money are reasonable (of course it depends on your political tendencies). But there is no doubt that, to the extent Bitcoin works, it represents a threat to the ability to enforce such rules.
Banks' economic calculus, I agree, is important, their decisions are not purely political. But in the current climate more than ever before, politics exerts a huge control over what they do, whether they like it or not.
To me, the real 'risk' with money is any central entity's ability to print it at will. 


Of course it *can*. Is that what you call it, though, when people choosing to buy a few thousand dollars of Bitcoin through Coinbase get their accounts shut down, or a startup company cannot get any one of tens or hundreds of banks to give them an account?

This is all a matter of semantics, but 'by fiat' literally means by (someone's) order. That's why government currencies are called fiat.
Bitcoin use is entirely voluntary and so its use as money is similar to gold - it started happening because people chose to do it that way, not because someone pointed a gun at them.
I presume that 'money backed by a physical commodity' in your perspective would include the physical commodity itself; otherwise gold for example could not be counted as a currency, or would be a fiat currency. So the real issue here is that you believe Bitcoin is not physical.
One of the biggest conceptual problems people have in this area is they think that digital things cannot be real. That's generally a very good intuition, but it fails with Bitcoin because Bitcoin can't be infinitely replicated, it requires energy to create it. Energy is very much physical.
I sometimes think of Bitcoin a bit more like diamonds than gold in as much as it's an object in a very low entropy state created by a large amount of 'heat' (work done in producing Bitcoin is random so there's a vague similarity there).

As a general principle, unless you are involved in bitcoin development (especially wallet development), it's best not to worry too much about how funds move through the various addresses that belong to you. It's easy to get things wrong if you try to control it manually, and the wallet expects to be in charge of handling that.
Blockchain.info no doubt treats any "pay into address" as a "pay into account" precisely because it wants to protect users from the possible mistakes around change addresses.

Oh I see. So, my criticism is that having only two categories of currency: (1) this country's currency and (2) other countries' currency, is not sufficient any more. In an ideal world, they should have created an additional category or a broader government category. The point is that functionally, it's a currency, and to whatever extent the law applies to it, the law should reflect that clear fact.
Don't get me wrong, I do agree it's arguable. But in general I think most law suffers from this problem of trying to pretend that categories and definitions actually cover the real world in ways they obviously don't.

Well, no, it's a huge step forward from the traditional exchange model. One, no middleman holds the customers funds - the funds travel direct from participant to participant (notice that this isn't quite true for localbitcoins today as you have to fund a wallet that they hold).

I've had a chance to review a lot of the Electrum code and imo it's very good indeed. The deterministic wallet construction with the mnemonic was really brilliant and apparently all the bitcoin devs agree as everyone is now moving to that model (or already has).
Personally I would never consider using a wallet which didn't have this feature any more - with deterministic wallets you never have to back up, and storing a 12 word seed is very easy (you can remember it as well as write it down). I travelled right across the world without any physical or digital evidence of bitcoin and was able to use my coins in the new location after about 1 minute.

Snarky title, and apparently "Bitcoin is far more limited in its current version that is commonly assumed.". I wonder if the speaker will explain things like:
* Decentralization of storage of funds reduces security risks by giving no central point of attack
* Absence of a counterparty by definition removes counterparty risk, one of the most important issues in finance.
* Multisignature transactions enable entirely new forms of security
* Petahashes of mining power make fraud effectively impossible at the protocol level
* Deterministic/HD wallets remove risks due to errors in backup
* Fairly elementary steps allow one to almost entirely remove the risk of stealing through viruses (air gap/live USB/Armory/offline transactions/paper wallets/brain wallets)
Or it will it be the same nonsense we hear in the media about how Bitcoin is "untrustworthy" (when in fact you don't need to trust anyone) and "too easily hackable".
Perhaps the speaker, who's apparently an expert in TLS, can go on to explain how utterly broken the CA model is, allowing the compromise of one company to immediately compromise millions of users across the globe.

Money is an uncountable noun, so indeed "a money" seems superficially wrong. But as I used to tell students often, there are actually no uncountable nouns, only uncountable contexts. This context *is* countable.
Example: sugar is uncountable, which is why we say "some sugar" and not "a sugar / some sugars". However, people will use sugar in a countable context in at least two real life situations: 1, when we are using "a sugar" as short for "a spoonful of sugar", i.e. I'll take two sugars with my tea, or 2, when we are speaking of different types of sugar, e.g. a biologist will speak of "simple sugars".
Now money is uncountable, but we can use it in a countable context in terms of types of money (like the sugar example above). So we can say bitcoin is a type of money, and there are several types of money. But like the sugars example, we might be lazy and say "a money" instead of "a type of money". So "a distributed .... money" is acceptable English, although "a distributed ... form of money" would be a more explicit way of saying it.

No, that's not it. Your way of qualifying worth is circular (it's worth something because it's worth something). Money tends to lead people into this kind of circular reasoning because of its nature. So I don't say you're 100% wrong, but I don't think you've got to the essence of it.
Bitcoin is worth something because it has a set of valuable properties that make it a near-ideal money. One of these properties is something like "non-confiscatability". If you have received bitcoins and that transaction has, say, 20 confirmations, there is just no way on Earth that anyone can reverse that transaction. They cannot be taken away without you giving the private key.
Amazon coin or any corporate coin cannot have this feature, and neither can any government coin. Physical cash does have this feature but it has other limitations.
On the other hand Amazon Coin may well have other very attractive features, specifically speed of processing (digital + centralized + not tied to legacy banking system = fast), but it will also have another massive negative which will be limited acceptance outside Amazon. This is the problem with all the corporates trying to make payment systems; money has to be a very neutral network to be universally accepted.

Rightly or wrongly, the vast majority have no trouble distinguishing between the actions of their own government and the concept of "my country".
And while some might be greatly angered by government actions on an internal basis, they'll defend everything to the death against the opinions of outsiders.

Technically, Electrum interacts with Electrum servers, so you're one step away from a direct interaction with the p2p network. This *could* have privacy implications, although not security-of-funds implications (because you are still in sole ownership of your private keys), so I'm not disagreeing, just clarifying on the 'directly interacts'.

Yeah, this is a huge deal. It's probably a lot easier today to start out in Bitcoin or Bitcoin-related development than even a year ago because of this. Great work.

Hmm. Having read the whole article, I am not impressed with your attitude. You seem to think that your problem arose out of Bitcoin security being weak, and that you've 'learned your lessons'. I'm really not sure you have learnt.
Handling company funds is often a tedious business, involving paperwork and accountant signatures and so on. That's unfortunate but necessary. You don't just let every employee in the company have the key to the drawer containing all the cash.
This has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin, except in as much that Bitcoin is much better than cash if you choose to avail yourself of more advanced features like multisig (and it's perfectly reasonable not to, as that's fairly new). But just treating it as cash, you should have very strict procedures in place to control who gets to use the keys. The fact that your developer could just paste it on pastebin is appalling.
You are really complaining that Coinbase is not as advanced in security as Paypal. But in this, Coinbase could never really win, because it is not storing a trust-based currency. It is storing cash. Any time it fucks up, it loses, irreversibly, its customers' cash. OK, maybe they are changing with the 'Vault' offering, insurance etc. I would still be suspicious of centralized solutions personally, but that's a choice, I accept. At least consider localized cold storage and please try to avoid leaving significant funds in a Coinbase hot wallet..
Edit to add:
I'm sorry to go on, but this is what gets me: you are a company who showed belief in Bitcoin earlier than most, and yet - how could you be in a position to lose **all** of your bitcoin to **one** user error? That's what's motivating this post. Honestly, that's shameful.

Of course but that's a consequence of the limit. In most cases as you scale up from $10 to $100 to $500 ( a more reasonable max) the commission won't increase by much at all, making the percentage more reasonable.

Even in the worst case scenarios, there are a couple of huge differences. First, more hashing power means more mined bitcoins, but does not increase the *rate* at which bitcoins are mined. Whereas with fiat currency, the rate of money printing is entirely at the discretion of the government/central bank. Second, as Satoshi pointed out in the whitepaper, an attacker who deliberately uses a &gt;51% share to defraud the network by double spending is devaluing the thing he's mining by corrupting it and removing faith in it. So he's not economically incented to defraud, except in a very stealthy, minor way. This is not the same for governments, since participation in their system of money is not voluntary, but enforced.
@_date: 2014-07-03 07:10:18


The problem is that there's a conceptual failure here. Bitcoin's technology does not make this any easier. Bitcoin creates ease of consensus on scarcity of an entirely abstract (not digital, but abstract) good. (Note there is no enforcement, either). It does nothing to create scarcity of digital goods.
If two strangers want to trade using a certain form of money (which is always an abstraction), they need to have a pre-existing consensus on ownership of money. 
People who 'consume' (simply experience) a digital good such as an artwork do not need to establish consensus on their ownership with anyone else.
The only effective way of creating artificial scarcity of digital goods remains violence (i.e. application of IP laws). Put another way, digital information is fundamentally abundant. Blockchains cannot and do not change that.

A correction (by the way, great work on all your videos):
Bitcoin can do M of N with N up to 15 today. Just last week I did an 8 of 15 spend (
However such a transaction does not satisfy IsStandard() rules right now, because the scriptSig is limited to 500 bytes, unless you choose a miner that happens to accept non-standard transactions (Eligius seems to be the main one).
The realistic limit with compressed pubkeys is 33*N+72*M &lt;500, roughly speaking ( a few bytes less), for standard. 4 of 5 is OK, 4 of 6 possibly (it's marginal).
In any case, the limit is significantly larger than just N&lt;=3. 
There is a pull request which might change (relax) these limits.

Yes, those numbers are roughly right. Clearly a new currency means money has to be created and held by some particular party initially.

@_date: 2014-07-21 07:05:17
The reward is not tied to the transactions - it's the minting of new currency, the size and timing of which was fixed (approximately) from the start of the protocol.
Should the half a trillion or so new dollars that the Fed printed last year be added to the transaction fees of all dollar exchanges that occurred? Granted, without working it out, it might actually be quite a small fee, but the point is we don't do that, do we.


Absolutely false. Holders of coin don't literally, directly, pay anything. All holders "pay" only in the indirect sense that during this early period, there is a substantial annual inflation in the coinage. The amount they 'pay' is proportionate to the amount they hold, so by no calculation can late adopters be said to pay more.

@_date: 2014-12-19 16:27:12
But it doesn't; at least not fully. Participants in the network are identified by pseudonyms, and an individual person can make as many pseudonyms as they like. Moreover, an important part of a voting system, for most people, is to implement a secret ballot. That can be done using blind signatures, another type of cryptography not used in Bitcoin.
You can definitely try to create an online voting system taking Bitcoin as a starting point, but it doesn't solve the problem.

All these are entirely voluntary. If a fool wants to give away his money, neither you or I have the ethical right to stop him.
Issues of rent-seeking with regard to land ownership, property ownership and violent coercion are not affected directly, but are certainly not made worse by Bitcoin; the ability to control one's own wealth without any intervention from more powerful parties is clearly an unalloyed good in this regard.
The really insidious rent seeking is found in the financial infrastructure, where the seignorage of central banks allows those in the elite to extract wealth from society ad infinitum, and the ability to demand payment in a certain form (taxation and debts enforced in fiat) gives even more power.

possibilities in no particular order: circle, bitfinex, coinbase, btcchina, huobi, okcoin, bitstamp, kraken, localbitcoins
There are probably 10 others, too.
First point: forget Paypal, bad idea for seller: money can be charged back too easily. Anyone offering to accept Paypal, treat them with suspicion.
You're in a specific situation: I'm guessing you have a Chinese bank account, and an American bank account. There's the issue of whether some identity verification is required, and in some cases that might mean residency evidence, which can be a problem. Buying with a credit card is generally a no no, although circle has made that possible for people (but mostly US residents and some western countries); but I guess in your situation it won't work. Localbitcoins is great to buy directly person to person for cash but I doubt you'll find it working for you in China.
There are a lot of details to consider. Overall I'd expect you can do it if you don't mind making a wire transfer and giving some basic ID info.
I bought my first bitcoin while living in China - but I went to Hong Kong to do it (it was way harder then).

As fascinating as ECC is, and as good of an article as that is (I read it some time ago too), I think it's not really helpful for a beginner in the field.

Travel might be the unexpected "hook" for Bitcoin. Think about these factors:
* Some of Bitcoin's best features are for international money transfer.
* However, people in poor countries usually don't have sufficient access to tech (or open minded enough governments/mafias to allow it) to get the best from it.
I could envision in particular that it might appeal to a backpacking crowd travelling through Europe, Asia and South America, living in hostels and so on. Handling multiple kinds of cash and cards can be a major annoyance and danger. The hostels could act as hub points where BTC could be changed informally for local cash (nice little side business, doesn't need to go on any books). 
However there's a bit of a drawback today, as you can't generally hail a cab or get a bus from the airport with Bitcoin...

Not really, at least not directly.
The double spend problem solution allows a group of untrusted parties to *agree* on the status of everyone's accounts on the bitcoin ledger. Notice it's only an agreement. I could make my own copy of the bitcoin ledger and modify it so I have a million bitcoins. I could then broadcast spending transactions based on that; the problem is that all the other nodes on the network would reject my transactions. So it's about consensus (and currency always is a problem of consensus, if you think about it).
On the other hand, if I want to steal a book I just have to get hold of the data. I don't need anyone else to agree that I own the book.
Solutions to DRM are based on cryptography, of course, and maybe there are ways to use a blockchain in that context. I'm not sure; but in and of itself, the blockchain doesn't solve the piracy "problem".

Yes, it's called "multisignature transactions" or "multisig" for short. Look up these terms as well as "P2SH" for documentation on the details.
You can have N of M keys required to pay out from an address, with M up to 15. Multisig addresses always start with a '3' instead of a '1'.

All of those things do indeed have committees which write open standards.
Nobody is forced to go along with those standards, but network effects matter.
What really defends the bitcoin protocol from corruption is that it has grown from a simple set of principles which everyone joining accepts. If a committee wrote a standard for Bitcoin going against those principles, or if core devs wrote adaptations violating those principles, people could and would walk away to a different coin/fork. That's what's keeping Bitcoin robust and preventing political corrupting power having too much effect.

As desirable as it it, let's not pretend it would be no big deal for forex brokers to add bitcoin. For real time trading of FX pairs they offset trades in the huge, fast and highly liquid interbank market. No such mechanism is possible with Bitcoin. If people want to real time trade BTC then their brokers are going to have to take positions, at the very least on the order of minutes. Brokers taking the other side of your trade are considered anathema by some in the forex world, and called pejoratively "bucket shops". Additionally, in forex, leverage of 10:1 is considered quite normal - whereas in Bitcoin this is nearly impossible to do. Bitfinex struggles with offering 2 or 3 to 1, for the obvious reason that bitcoin volatility is far higher (50 times more?) than for typical currency pairs.
Large pre-existing bitcoin exchanges could take the role of the interbank market, and allow brokers like oanda to offset trades real time. The events of this week do not help in that regard :)

It's far easier to integrate a centralized currency. Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency and that makes it much more difficult.


Of course order matching is easy. The backoffice and post-trade process is exactly what I was talking about - the main issue is how to manage the risk of something so volatile and, crucially, illiquid.


You are right that I forgot to mention that one, and it's incredibly important.
Another thing I forgot to mention is the other possible trading models than pure spot trading. There are CFDs, futures and options. One possible advantage with these models is having fixed settlement-into-bitcoin times (and of course the contracts could be settled into cash rather than bitcoin). The problem with spot is having to square positions continuously.

This is a common mistake in my opinion. People think that Bitcoin just distributes trust, but the change that Bitcoin represents is more dramatic than just decentralization. As Satoshi says in the whitepaper, you're replacing trust with cryptographic proof (or verification). I don't have to trust an authority that 6+7 is 13, as I know how to verify it for myself. Similarly, I don't have to trust that miners are performing the protocol correctly - I can check it, and I do, by running a node.
Contrast with a bank, or Paypal, or a government issued currency. In all cases the arbiter of the validity of transaction, and the validity of the coinage/money being used, is opaque, and must be trusted.

The same is true of almost every other industrial activity. If I try to farm my own food, I am going to do it badly and fail and lose money. Same with energy. Food and energy are just as critical as money. People can cooperate to engage in these kinds of activities and gain from economies of scale to improve performance.

I think it's the other way round. You can trust a corporation (in some very loose sense) to be motivated by its own profit to the detriment of almost anything else. Government's motive is extremely muddy, "corrupted" in the most exact sense of that word, as it's a mixture of ideologies, money, democratic forces, media, and powerful corporate influence.
So in other words you can trust corporations a lot more than governments because they are driven by a much more coherent kind of motive.
On ability government may seem weaker, but it has violent coercive power, and in some cases, seignorage. These are enormous powers so that if government ever manages to find a coherent will, it can effect enormous change.

I really don't think so; immanence here means all-pervasiveness, inherent-ness. Just like his beautiful quote in the Dark Wallet video: "a system is approaching perfection - just in time for our disappearance" - he's recognizing that exactly the same technologies allowing for a panopticon state are also allowing decentralization to remove individuals from state power.
I guess you *could* go for imminence, but that would mean something that's about to happen, rather than happening right now. You can make an argument that it makes sense, but no, I don't think so.
I was actually going to lambast the BBC for getting the quote wrong, but Wilson's verbiage is always dense and he rather mumbles. So it's difficult to criticize them too much; but the fact that they put "eminence" in there just proves they're not even attempting to understand.

 Hard money does not arise work-lessly; violence and warships, gold mining or hashing are alternative models, they all require energy. Proof of stake systems are superficial and do not address the real issue. There is no free lunch.
I realise you don't agree, but using this as a rebuttal is begging the question.

Main differences:
Localbitcoins runs a central server, bitsquare does not (it's a P2P network, a DHT to be technical).
Localbitcoins requires you to put your btc in a wallet that they hold (I think that's always true?), bitsquare does not (well, cannot as there is no central server).
Bitsquare arbitration means putting bitcoins into a 2 of 3 multisig address, not giving it to localbtc.
Bitsquare arbitration is intended to involve a market of arbitrators from which you choose.
Despite those big differences, there is somewhat of a similarity because it's an OTC market: a bunch of people put up offers, and then others come along and accept them. However, getting down to the nitty gritty, in this regard it's a bit more like bitcoin.de than localbitcoins. u/nucleo_io may want to expand on that.

It's not a bad idea; it would be functionally somewhat similar to handing over credit card details to a merchant (without the identity implications), in that the merchant is authorised to make the payments when they choose. I guess better, because you've pre-approved the exact amounts. And, as you say, the customer can pull out at any time by draining the funds to other addresses.
Just like with credit cards, you'd only do it with merchants you really trust since otherwise they can just grab it all when they feel like.
(Edit: on second thoughts, not the same of course - credit card payments can be reversed. So it requires a very high level of trust in the merchant. Hmm.)
Interaction with existing wallet software would be a bit funky, as you'd effectively have locked up specific utxos (assuming you want to go through with those partially signed txs).
 Interesting idea.

There are various models for trade that require various degrees of trust, from a large amount of trust required - using a forex broker or bitcoin exchange and storing large sums on them - to almost none - trade cash for bitcoins peer to peer with a 2 of 3 multisig as arbitration in case of dispute.
But that is not at all what I am talking about. Storing money in the form of gold or cash (arguable, but let's say) requires no trust because there is no counterparty. The same is true of bitcoin if you have the private key, with the added bonus that bitcoin does actually function like cash, or better than cash, and on the internet too.
TLDR: bank money requires trust just to store; bitcoin does not.

Sure you can look at it like that, but mining is not static. Don't forget the inflation rate in year 1 was infinite.
I think one could just as easily look at the mining/minting process as orthogonal to the transactions, especially when you consider that *the minting of coins was entirely defined from the start*. 
Since the market therefore has the information openly, it prices it in. So every person buying a bitcoin can factor that into their decision about future value.
Note how transaction fees are different: they are a cost directly tied to transacting, and over time can and will change to reflect the necessary incentive to miners/transaction processors.

you don't mean "Terawatts per hour" or TW/h (note: capital T), since Watts are Joules per second. You mean TWh.
1.4kW means 1.4 kWh per hour.
To the numbers:
Where did you get this?:
(900 000 000 000 / 7 200 000) * 1.4
= 5 216 250 000 kW/h
The correct answer to the calculation is 175000 not 5216250000.
If you take that 175000 kWh (per hour) and multiply it by 24x365 you get 1533 000 000 so that's 1.5 TWh per year, comparing with Switzerland's 60TWh per year (electricity consumption only).
Lastly, the network as a whole is going to be much more energy efficient than a retail ASIC box, I would assume. (Disclaimer: I have never thought carefully about the total energy usage of the network, so I haven't got much idea).

You're welcome; 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 seem like the really useful ones now, but in the future it'd be nice to be able to do the larger ones for things like: voting pools, corporate actions, other collaborative projects. E.g. DarkWallet did a 3 of 5 with their funding. Voting pools can be very useful as it removes the threat of a rogue server in a federated server model. In those contexts, 15 is a bit limiting really, but it's not bad.

It asks you to make a password when you first create (or recover) the wallet.
On TAILS, you can either use a persistent volume (encrypted), or you can just reinstall Electrum each time and recover from seed.

There is a huge difference between publishing and coin minting - the fomer does not require any consensus. With bitcoin we literally "publish" transactions, and that's what corresponds to the non-censorship that we have nowadays in media (or we hope to).
I don't see proof of stake as a solution to the Byzantine Generals problem of distributed consensus, so we'll have to just disagree on that one.
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:00:38
Yes but that doesn't mean that bitcoins are any less bitcoins. I read that to mean that one could create coins/assets on sidechains distinct from bitcoins, not that these would in any way be transferrable back to bitcoins.
One of us for sure misunderstood that - if it's me, then I'm entirely with you, it's a complete bastardisation of the system. I'll try to find out.
If you're referring to 5.1.2 I'm pretty sure you're misreading it. I think it's suggesting that miners could be rewarded with demurrage fees. This has no effect on total Bitcoin supply (and by the way, nor could it: whatever funky rules you create on a sidechain, it cannot affect supply on the main chain since it doesn't alter transaction rules there - the worst it can do is destroy coinage).
@_date: 2014-10-31 16:21:49
Just think of a sidechain as another place your Bitcoins can live. It's not an altcoin with an entry in the bitcoin ledger, it's a bitcoin which is temporarily locked up on the bitcoin ledger while it gets transacted on a different ledger, which has different properties.

@_date: 2014-08-04 05:15:52
Of course, but equally obviously: this is not sufficient.
It's been discussed many times before, but a crypto-crypto exchange is definitely the most plausible kind of mixer, but the caveat is: on a centralized exchange, a record could be kept of transactions, thus preserving the link both inbound and outbound.
With decentralized exchanges, this problem might be avoided (but be careful - are all trades recorded on some kind of blockchain? then you're back to square one). And in case you're thinking "decentralized exchanges are a pipe dream" - well, for fiat, somewhat, but for crypto-crypto, not really, there are already several projects in operation that have at least some of the required features.
Essentially, what is needed is atomic cross chain transactions, in which the cross-chain part is obfuscated. I don't remember the details, but I think "Coin Swap" was an interesting solution.

The proof of passport one is interesting but the fallback on centralized government identity systems, even if cryptographic, doesn't sit well with voting (edit: to be clear, I mean if you're trying to make voting independent of central power structures. If you're not, then we already have that system). 
Mike's idea makes more sense - using government identities to achieve goals within systems totally outside of government. But from a paranoid point of view, it's dangerous, and becomes more so as Bitcoin (or similar) becomes more politically important.

It's deeper than that; it's also that you can't split the technology from the medium of exchange.

It could be done seamlessly, in theory, by declaring that each unit of the existing fiat currency is convertible to x mbtc and proving the backing by signing messages proving ownership of BTC addresses that fulfil the backing.

Whether you pay with Bitcoin or USD cash, you *may* get a refund after a cash payment - check the merchant's policies.
The currency is not the issue; the issue is the payment type and the merchant policies. And, of course, you cannot pay online with USD cash, whereas with Bitcoin you can.

Mixers suffer from the third party trust issue that Bitcoin was designed to avoid entirely. If the mixing service is trustable, they make damn good anonymity, but there's still a big "if" there.
"CoinJoin" means using the unlinkedness between tx ins and outs. Not very easy to make it completely seamless for the user, but if you manage it and if enough people use it, it's really good anonymity.
I should dial back a bit in the sense that CoinJoin will never make perfect anonymity, but it leaves the tracer with no proof that one particular input is associated with one particular output, which gives full deniability in a legal setting as far as I can see, especially if the "joins" are big enough and frequent enough. Unfortunately the legal scenario doesn't help if a thug is trying to extract what he thinks are your bitcoin; then you have to actually dissuade him, not just make a logical denial.
There are even more complex and clever attempts to completely disassociate inputs from outputs - see "CoinSwap". But they require a lot more work.

This will never really give you peace of mind, though, if you're trying to stash significant coinage. I don't actually think switch-off-internet-while-you-generate is a particularly meaningful thing to do. Far more significant is the risk that malware is already resident.
The reason that people make suggestions that look over the top is because Bitcoin represents such a paradigm shift. We have machines connected to an enormous worldwide trustless network for thousands of hours, only ever worrying that we might lose some data .. and suddenly we put thousands in cash on it (not even credit, which can be reclaimed, but cash).
It's just a plain bad idea, even if the risk is low. Generate privkeys on clean OS installs, unless you're only dealing with pocket change.

Satoshi put it like this on the P2P forums:




Bold mine. Notice the language "I don't know a way" and "could". One interpretation is that he was quite agnostic about money supply; he saw a way of creating a commodity type money, and went for it.
Note that the limitations he refers to (inability to peg) do **not** imply that he couldn't have created a predetermined inflationary schedule, as indeed some other coins have chosen to do (e.g. Ethereum). If you read him more broadly (in particular his comments about banks, governments and inflation), I think you'll get the impression that he believes the finite supply is an advantage rather than a disadvantage.
Gavin Andreesen once made an interesting comment about this which really resonated with me - it's not so much that a particular inflation schedule is better, it's more that if the inflation schedule is predetermined in advance, it really doesn't matter exactly what it is (I paraphrase of course). I think that kind of argument should appeal to an economist. Seems like a lot of modern monetary theory (if that's the right phrase) is more based on the opposite - that the game is all about keeping the populace guessing :)

(Assuming M of 3 multisig addresses for simplicity):
Sort of no, really. Because while you can spend out from the 3 multisig addresses to any other valid address, including a fourth multisig address, there will be no connection between the 9 private keys that control the first three multisig addresses and the 3 private keys that control the fourth. 
So you can spend between them but there's no "layering". More concretely, there's no way in which those original 9 keys can somehow form a control mechanism over the second layer. Unless there's a more complex/clever way to do it that I haven't thought of.

Well, they make you wait because (a) bank transfers also take days, in many cases and (b) they are subject to heavy AML type regulations.
To be clear: I am *not* a supporter or opponent of Coinbase, and have never used them. Other ways to buy bitcoins include: localbitcoins.com, Mycelium trader, bank wires to exchanges like bitstamp etc.
None of these are anywhere close to instant either (I guess Mycelium might be pretty fast in certain cases), and you should do careful research before using any of them.
The reason you can't get bitcoins instantly online is because it's cash; this means that if you try to buy it with a reversible payment mechanism (Paypal, credit cards being the obvious examples), then the person selling bitcoins to you is taking an unacceptable risk that you will reverse the charge on them, leaving out the bitcoins (an irreversible payment) and out the fiat money that you 'sent'.
Be wary of people offering these kind of payment services. It isn't a valid business model, so there's a chance they might be scamming you.
If you don't have time to set up an account and wait a few days, I would advise you to stay away; this takes some time and effort (a lot less for those people who have access to services like Coinbase; don't forget most of the world has no such opportunity).

(I am mostly referring to the other comments here, not the main essay).
I think the term "peg" being used is very unfortunate here (and yes I'm aware it's the very term Adam Back uses), and I think it's confusing a lot of people. A currency peg implies a mechanism to enforce an unchanging exchange rate between two different currencies. This is nothing like that; this is  **a mechanism to move bitcoins from one blockchain to another blockchain**.
And in case you want to object that technically, bitcoins are not actually moving to the other blockchain, you're right, but it's worth remembering that bitcoins do not actually move in a normal bitcoin transaction either, because there is no such thing as "a bitcoin". There is just updating of balances following a conservation rule for the number of bitcoins; and it's the same thing in this sidechain architecture.
That's why you wouldn't usually have to worry about a discrepancy between the value of coins on the side chain and on the main chain; as long as the mechanism exists fairly frictionlessly to move your bitcoins between one and the other, they will have to be priced the same modulo that friction (the principle of no arbitrage). Only to the extent that that ability was lost (meaning the sidechain is broken somehow) would the values diverge.

And weirdly, in markets, not only can demand be inelastic but sort of negative-elastic (maybe there's a technical term for it), where people want more as the price goes up. Actually there is a technical term for it (the idea that people find high prices more desirable) but I forget.

You have to ask yourself what a blockchain offers over a traditional database.
If any single bank (or industry group, e.g. SWIFT) has actual control over the blockchain (let's say, the ability to reverse or block transactions), then you're creating a very expensive data structure when a database would work much more efficiently. Databases can still be distributed and synchronised over multiple servers, multiple locations etc.
If any central party has control there is no need to solve the Byzantine Generals problem, no need for proof of work/mining etc.
What Bitcoin is giving us is a ledger which cannot be retroactively edited by *any* party at all - whereas a bank's or central bank's ledger only ensures no malicious editing by anyone *except* that bank. Which some people might see as fine, but in that case, why a blockchain?

Same story as Bitcoin - there is no central server, so there's nothing to shut down.
But, similar to bittorrent, if individual people, acting as nodes, are doing something that's deemed to be illegal, the cops could go after them.

Vitalik, this to me is either too blase or not thought through. What would be the point of such a database? I see two possibilities:
* Transactions are illegal if they are not using such a signed "account". This is the coinvalidation option, which will kill fungibility, and with it Bitcoin
* Your finances are assessed based on such signed "accounts", but the rest of "unsigned" Bitcoin goes on unmolested. Who in that case would choose to use their taxed address when they can be anonymous?
So it's either the death of Bitcoin or it's pointless.

It's a free call option, barring cost of integration, which is much lower than you might think. Transaction fees are low, there is no volatility risk using one of the two main merchant processors. You might gain a lot of custom, you might not, but you lose nothing.
Why is it the future of ecommerce? 
* The fact that it represents final and immediate settlement online (which is just another way of looking at the fact that it's peer to peer without a central counterparty). Which removes all counterparty risk and lowers fees (from about 50% to 100% reduction). 
*  The consumer experience: not having to enter payment credentials is a big deal. This makes the security model with bitcoin far superior for the customer (cf Target data leak), but also it brings you a lot closer to a one-click payment even for new customers. It's basically (a) click pay with bitcoin (b) take your phone and scan the qr code on the page (c)hit "send" on your phone.
* Enabling international payments (this is a huge deal, but may not be applicable to a lot of merchants who don't/won't send goods internationally), especially to those who don't possess a credit card or PayPal account.

In short, no, because a multisig (P2SH) address does not correspond to a public-private keypair.
It may conceivably be possible using bitcoin scripting, but I think not. This has definitely been discussed before, as far as I remember there is no simple way.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:07:32
Your example of the customer wishing to return just because the BTC value has gone up just goes to show that BTC is not ready to be used as a unit of account yet. It's too early. However, by including the payment network features (it is basically one or two click payment for anyone in the world, with no fees) it's a win-win for both sides of the deal. Just keep pricing everything in dollars for now. The market is not deep enough for hedging by large players yet.
Your bosses' "argument" that they should go and change the BTC for cash is, frankly, moronic. Why impose extra transfer fees? Nobody is going to be forced to use BTC, but if they want to, why not take the extra custom? The merchant can get incredibly cheap payment processing from bitpay (much cheaper than CC), and avoid the possibility of fraud.
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:25:56
I sometimes worry more that we're too early rather than late. It's weird to say, because it seems like everyone "knows" about Bitcoin now.

Fractional reserve is only dangerous with something like gold precisely because only institutions like banks can afford the necessary security and transport costs to keep large quantities of gold. The barrier has been dramatically lowered, with transportation costs reduced to zero and also in terms of cost for securing large amounts of wealth with cryptocurrencies. Hence there doesn't need to be a massive concentration of wealth in bitcoin banks. 
Moreover notice that he's not arguing against money issuance by banks (debt), only arguing for an overarching controlling entity. The solution that central banks offered to bank runs was for governments to grant to that central entity the ability to print at will ("by fiat"). This is not actually solving the problem of bank runs/confidence at all, it's cheating (in both senses - people are cheated of their savings over time).
If and when (I'm sure it'll happen) some very large entities become custodians of extremely large sums, and issue certificates based on them, then you could imagine  some kind of "Audit the Coinbase" movement - but that's when the other advantage of Bitcoin comes into play - *everything is publically verifiable on the blockchain* - so a company can be audited by requiring them to sign against addresses holding coins (the coins can then be moved/mixed if necessary for secuirty). You might say, they won't do that, but the point is that their customers can demand it or move to another bitcoin bank.
 All the while the solutions for individuals to protect themselves will get better. It is already possible to store wealth without anyone else knowing about it, making it safe. It's already possible to do transactions offline, so no one can possibly know your key online. It's getting better, rapidly, and more and more people are habituating themselves to being properly secure.
Altcoins represent competition, but without hashing power or network effects, they remain a marginal issue. Of course, that could change; the jury's out. But what's for sure is no one will place value in an altcoin without hashing power behind it (I'll sidestep the proof of stake argument for now), so we don't have an infinite money supply problem as we do with central banks.

It's true that variances add linearly, but variance is not the measure of expected deviation from the mean, standard deviation is. Variance is the square of standard deviation. So expected deviation "adds in quadrature" to use an old turn of phrase. So when you scale up by 10, the increase in deviation you can expect is a factor of sqrt(10) rather than 10.
(Of course this is all assuming uncorrelated variables, which applies alright here).

Interesting. I wonder if someone who is staunchly democratic socialist would still see the value in this way: concentration of the power to print money in the hands of a few entities (central banks - banks - government, a kind of nexus of power) is incredibly dangerous, not just because of corruption, but because the democratic process will always find the "easy path", which is that government will spend money which is essentially printed (via sophisticated methods like QE, but still really printing) rather than taking the hard decision of sourcing government expenditure through direct taxation.
Thus, even if you are pro government spending on services, you could still, I hope, see why a government fiat money is, if not completely unethical, at least very dangerous.
What do you think?
If you don't see a disadvantage in fiat money, however, then the advantages of a cryptocurrency are kind of trivial, just things like low transaction cost. After all, the fast global transfer feature is a direct consequence of the fact that Bitcoin does *not* respect government sanctions on the transfer of value. And the unfortunate thing is you can't really have a "GovernmentCoin" (as many want) because that reintroduces the central third parties, reintroducing the middle man cost.

This is how it begins. First DAOs are for harmless things like betting sites, but then they will be used to manage bitcoin mining operations, and they will become wildly successful, even creating slight forks to the bitcoind nodes they run, manipulating btc prices to their advantage - eventually they will accumulate a lot of capital and be able to buy and order modified forms of drones which they will own via smart property contracts on the blockchain so that no human can wrest control.
We don't have much time left.

you might want to go back to the btctalk threads, i was arguing the other side to you there. no need to rehash this old ground.
Sidechains are a way to extend Bitcoin's blockchain horizontally, instead of vertically, because the latter will eventually break scalability (Bitcoin is a broadcast protocol instead of point to point, like the internet).
Note that I said: "You can't have a blockchain exchanging tokens that are not cryptographically verifiable (by everyone on the network!)" : that's exactly why cross chain transfers can work, because they satisfy that criterion.

As I say in the whitepaper abstract, "The evidence is irrefutable as long as the auditor trusts the server’s public key."
That's the root of trust. It's also why in the Auditor guide you see several steps that the auditor must take at the end of the audit to cross-verify that the correct certificate for the given server was used. The auditor does not rely on the auditee's browser in any way.

No. The principal reason Bitcoin is different from the existing financial system is that it replaces seignorage "by fiat" with seignorage by an algorithm.
As Krugman has accurately pointed out, fiat is backed by "men with guns". That also goes for all the gatekeeping functions preventing honest businesses from taking market share. It is no accident that no one in Britain has succeeded in getting a banking license in the last 100 years.
Most of what makes money in finance is not made from the actual value-added of transaction processing. It is fundamentally about the extent to which fiat money allows regulatory capture. Witness the enormous explosion in the proportion of US GDP attributable to finance in the decades since the USD became the world's predominant reserve currency. Earlier pre-fiat systems based on metals weren't really better because of the physical limitations, which meant only substantial physical power allowed the accumulation of wealth. Crypto removes that physical limitation.
This is a long, long way from a direct swap of power from one group to the other.

@_date: 2014-10-23 13:19:47
Yes, that's reasonable. I think as a practical point it's worth pointing out that it's radically different from a currency peg, as you see from time to time in the fiat currency world.
For example, Hong Kong pegs its dollar to a bank like 7.5-7.7.5 per USD (I forget the exact numbers). It achieves this by periodically going into the market and buying/selling Hong Kong dollars. There are plenty of examples of this around the world, some more permanent than others, but more importantly they are never really *permanent* and so not completely to be trusted.
What sidechains is doing is very different; it's a cryptographic tie of one asset to another, rather than an attempt to guarantee a market exchange rate in a certain band. So it's much more like *backing* than *pegging*, except again it's a cryptographic contract rather than a legal/promissory one.

Yes, I think the issue here was I used the phrase "unfavourable rates" for banks. I certainly didn't mean unfavourable compared to what you get (effectively) with BTC.
Meanwhile I am not up to date on the actual numbers. I got used to forex interbank rates at one point, so to me the difference between .5% and 2% is not really interesting :) It is all a bit of a ripoff (if you're exchanging above 100K) when the bank can immediately trade that interbank themselves for a tiny fraction of a percent, with a tiny bit of effort put into their IT back end. It's basically just a government mandated cartel. 
Average people get ripped off very badly in forex, but BTC unfortunately is not *yet* a solution. It might not take that long, though.

Are you saying "no it can't be backed"?
Yes, of course the bank run possibility exists, just as with gold. The existence of completely provable audits (not idiotic pretend audits by suits) changes the dynamic quite significantly though. It dramatically reduces the extent to which running a (central) bank is just a confidence game (which it is almost entirely today).

* Prove your name and address if it's recorded on a trusted website
* Prove you received a threatening private message from an internet troll
* Prove you received a money transfer.
* Audit a bitcoin exchange's claims.
* Prove that a scammy website doctored the claims on its front page.

I was about to agree; a SWIFT transfer is going to be on the order of 10s of dollars, not thousands. However, don't forget they're going to have to convert from AUD to USD. It is *very* common for banks to give very unfavourable rates by default for this kind of transfer, and it is conceivable to lose maybe .5%-1% on that. I have heard of many cases of Brits getting upset when buying houses in Southern Europe due to this kind of thing.
Having said all that, of course using BTC is not really going to help here in its current limited liquidity state.

You're reading the first post - ignore the stuff below the horizontal bar, it isn't an up to date description as far as I remember. If you're interested read the last couple of pages.
Grab cookies: the cookies are stripped out (all of the client-&gt;server traffic is stripped). Also, the only thing that's revealed is a single web page - none of the rest of the traffic is audited, so there is no possibility of login information being revealed.
We have also been looking at a modification that would allow one to reveal only a portion of text on the page. At the moment we can't see how to make that cryptographically solid, so we're not proposing it.
As to 'trustless' - as it stands, no this is not a trustless solution. The idea is that an auditor (let's not say escrow) gets to make a decision on whether the money transfer took place or not. It *is* trustless in the sense that you are not passing money to the auditor (so not "escrow"), and the authority as to whether the evidence is real is coming from the bank's certificate, not from a dodgy scanned letter or similar.

Because the banking sector hates Bitcoin, basically. It seems a lot of people would prefer to disbelieve this even though the evidence comes in day after day after day.

This is a nice solution to revocation of self-signed certs.
It doesn't address the more fundamental problem with the current PKI: browsers don't trust self-signed certs, and one can't imagine that changing soon.
Let's Encrypt could be a nice step forward for some cases. Google's CT is great too in its own way (and it's "blockchain without the bitcoin" in a way that actually makes sense :) ).
The fundamental issue always has been that users will not take any responsibility (not a criticism, just a fact). That's why we have the current appalling PKI infrastructure instead of e.g. a WoT, and also why no one uses proper E2E encryption like gpg. It's also why very few people use Bitcoin as intended.
Combining this system with WoT would be cool. Namecoin based solutions would also be cool. The question is, how do you make it something in mass use.

Interesting. Committing hashes of data rather than actual data is the usual way to achieve proof of existence. This means that existence can only be proven by producing the original data. I see some subtleties in this case; the data will have to follow a standardised format, and adding some kind of salt to prevent the hash value being "static" is not going to work I think.
(If it isn't obvious what I mean, consider if the data is "John Smith, Drug 1, dose 2, Jan 2014" - to snoop, you just have to cycle through combinations of name, drug name, dose, date, generate a hash and see if that hash appears in the blockchain. Adding random data to the input prevents that, but also prevents verification. How do you have verification without snooping? I think the prescription filler needs a secret that they provide, which is added to the hash, but there are other problems with that.)

The funding of companies may be considered to matter, but what this view on things tends to overlook is the importance of open source and open access.
The *entirety* of Bitcoin development is open to review: every commit is in public, and you can read the discussions and debates about these changes directly on github (with extra discussion happening in other public forums, the dev mailing list, the IRC channels). But the discussion is peripheral, the main point is that all code is public.
The most important reason that matters of course is for security. Thousands of experts worldwide are reviewing Bitcoin's security constantly, and there is a massive bug bounty. But it's also important for protocol updates.
Some investors have directly funded projects attempting to subvert this kind of open source review process for consensus. Other big companies have, I think wrongly, not chosen to support *any* Bitcoin development efforts, either by sponsoring open source coders, or by allocating members of their own teams to work on the open source project (a model often used in other areas like Linux).


This is just errant nonsense. By definition cash is settlement, ownership without counterparty risk, and that is what Bitcoin provides and always has. The idea that it can do it with free transactions, if it actually gains significant adoption is fantasy. If you think ViaBTC is in the business of doing that, you should be asking them to mine all transactions for free; curiously, they are not doing that. Zero fee transactions results in trivial DOS. Huge blocks are a catastrophe for Bitcoin even working, unless it degrades into a few trusted datacenters, which exposes it to the exact kind of attack that its central purpose was to prevent - state actors taking over or banning it by force.


Serious academic work has strongly suggested that 4MB is an upper limit; segwit already provides 2MB (and 4MB in case of an attack is the theoretical limit).
So if you actually care about (a) bigger blocks quickly and (b) *actual* scalability improvements, support segwit, not ViaBTC or whoever else is blocking Bitcoin's progress.

You can buy things with it online pretty safely.
The problem comes when you want to buy some, or change some for fiat. How can you do that in a decentralized way? It's really difficult. Localbitcoins came close, but ultimately it isn't decentralized, so at the very least it's a magnet for hackers, let alone other powerful interests.

This question is kind of the heart of the issue - what makes Bitcoin scarce. That's what makes it different from all previous attempts at creating digital cash. Earlier efforts were based around a much more traditional concept - some centrally controlling company simply states by decree (by fiat, if you will) that 'there are 1 billion X bucks' - or used the concept of backing - each unit of e-gold was backed by a certain amount of physical gold in a vault. The latter had the advantage of theoretically preventing excessive money printing because gold can't be conjured out of nothing, but it still suffered the massive weakness of centralized control, meaning that either the owner could be dishonest, or he could be attacked by governmental entities (the latter actually happened). The former of course has a more obvious weakness - it entirely relies on trusting that the central controlling entity won't be tempted to print more money.
Bitcoin doesn't try to *back* a digital asset with a physical asset like gold, but tries to recreate its scarcity through limiting production through the requirement to do work (use up energy). You can't mine bitcoins without expending physical work, and what's more the algorithm used to determine how many bitcoins are produced per unit of work ratchets up or down according to how much energy the whole bitcoin network is expending per second. This allows the rate of production to be controlled.
However even that's not the full story; that tells you how it's possible to have a fixed rate of production per unit time (which steadily reduces, reaches zero by around 2140), but there is still the question of consensus. Bitcoin is open source code and any individual node in the network can run a modified version of the software if they want; nobody will stop them. But here's where the *openness* of the protocol creates its magic - if I run a node and try to assign myself a larger number of bitcoins per unit of energy expenditure, or just that randomly gives me X extra bitcoins everyone else on the network sees that I'm not following the rules, and rejects my transactions. Since no one is incented to allow anyone else to create extra bitcoins for themselves (since that would reduce the value of my own holdings), we have a very strong stable equilibrium. For 6 years already, that consensus has been maintained.
It should be noted that people *are* incented to 'make up their own bitcoins' by creating alternative networks running a bitcoin-like algorithm - for example, Litecoin. However, the strength of these networks is a function of how well they defend against attacks - if they're very small, what's to stop a bunch of other people coming in with a lot of mining power (a lot of energy to expend) and take over their network, and screw up the consensus? The more you think about it, the more you realise that Bitcoin's network effect is not just 'more people accept Bitcoin than Litecoin' - it's also the actual physical power of the network that gives it strength.

The truth is that there is no such thing as a "bitcoin" in the system.
In the whitepaper somewhere Satoshi writes "We define a coin as a chain of digital signatures". It's a very abstract definition, and it certainly doesn't correlate with '1 Bitcoin'.
The real objects in question are "unspent transaction outputs". For example, I send 0.1 BTC to you, at that point there is on the network the record of an unspent tx output. That utxo is something only you can sign, as it was locked to your public key. When you want to spend it, you have to provide a digital signature, and that will create 1 or more new unspent transaction outputs, each one locked to some particular public key that you, in turn, have chosen.
Bitcoins don't really appear in this picture **except as a measuring unit**. So it's very much like asking "show me, where is "the mile" or "the inch" ". There is no object which we can identify as an inch, it's just how we choose to measure. 
What enforces the scarcity is the protocol rules: principally, the rule that transactions will only be accepted if the total of their outputs, measured in bitcoins, is smaller than the total of their inputs. Of course also the rules related to new coin minting (the coinbase transaction rules).

Depends on the brokerage; Interactive Brokers lets you loan out your shares to short sellers for a fee. And it seems entirely legitimate to me. 
The problem, where there is one, arises because it's only a matter of trust that more is not lent out than exists, since it's all just records on someone's database.
With bitcoin, you could have genuine shorting through lending, but obviously it introduces counterparty risk.
In general, it's very narrow minded to say that shorting shouldn't exist. In its pure sense, it's a voluntary contract between two parties and can never be prevented. It aids price discovery and liquidity by providing an avenue to express a negative opinion.

The distinction between speculation and investment is muddy. In the case of stocks particularly so; one can envisage the purchase of stocks paying dividend as investment, i.e. in terms of yield, but a company can stop paying dividends at any time (indeed, can go out of business), so it's still speculation.
Even buying a house has an element of speculation, even if you don't plan to sell, and even though you get real utility day by day; you have to account for the fact that it might burn to the ground next year and compare the risk of ownership with the expense of renting. 
As to things like gold, a goldbug would say it's not speculation to hold wealth in gold but rather the opposite (that a holder of fiat currency is speculating on the future value of an uncertain asset, namely that currency) - and the history of your own country shows that that perspective is not *totally* stupid, even if it's highly arguable.
When it comes to Bitcoin, it's easy to just *assert* that the only value is speculative; however my own personal experience is that I have gotten actual utility in a few cases from being able to pay in Bitcoin rather than another currency - for example, making payments online in a slightly more frictionless way and more significantly, without giving up credit card credentials or personal info that a website might screw up keeping safe. I could give a few other scenarios, but that isn't really the point. It's stupid to say "oh, the utility is only X, so it should never be worth that much", because in 2009 the utility was exactly zero (you could buy *nothing* with Bitcoin), and yet today it is very different. You have to analyze it dynamically; there are feedback loops. Is it *more* speculative than government bonds or USD cash? Of course! Nobody said you should put your life savings in it (almost everyone has always said the opposite).

In Joinmarket, the "takers" pay fees to the "makers" to provide liquidity. The btc network transaction fee split between participants is negotiable; but yes, in principle it might help to slightly reduce those fees. By the way the joinmarket order book can be seen at joinmarket.io right now.
True, coinjoin could help to reduce block size (as gmaxwell points out in the original CoinJoin post as i recall) in an ideal scenario, as you're pointing out, but it's not going to make enough difference to counteract the O(n^2 ) scaling of bandwith consumption.

The ATM card analogy is not quite exact; you may take your card across an international border, but there will be daily limits enforced by your bank at home as to how much money you can withdraw.
When you go across an international border as a bitcoin holder, it is a bit more like you kept a stack of gold bars at home that you can magically transport to the new country at any time. It could be millions worth in theory, and you need have absolutely no physical or digital record while you cross the border (Electrum seed in brain only).
I did this myself recently, in my own small way :) Travelled to the other side of the world, set up a localbitcoins sell and got a thousand dollars worth of spending money in local currency. My bank had no knowledge and collected no fee, the border guards knew nothing, governments knew nothing. Itshappening.jpg.

There is no direct relationship. Today, the latter are a small fraction (&lt; 1%) of the former.


Technically, you could go back and rewrite it now, but it wouldn't have enough PoW so no one following the rules would include it. If miners all stopped today, Bitcoin would basically freeze until enough miners restarted (it would be a catastrophic failure). If difficulty went back to 1 or something, you could start adding blocks yourself, but you can't retroactively write the chain, because it has huge PoW embedded and you can't replicate that.

The specific unfairness that Bitcoin removes is the seignorage power of the state, which means that there is no limit to which favoured parties can be supported (banks bailed out) and no limit to spending by that government (unending wars, unending pension promises to curry favor without having supporting incomes).
This means that the poorest in society, who have no access to ownership of investment assets but can only save in cash or cashlike deposits, inevitably lose out over time to the inflation created by this seignorage. (e.g. 90%+ loss of purchasing power of the US dollar in a century.)
In a Bitcoin or similar world, wealth does not magically get distributed equally or fairly initially, but the critical point is that those who have more money cannot endlessly protect and increase that position by unfair access to the "spigot" of printed money. This is why it's meaningful that Bitcoin was created just as the US govt handed out literally a trillion dollars to corrupt bankers who had utterly failed.
The other mechanisms that maintain inequality apart from the financial one, e.g. violence, land ownership etc., are not addressable by Bitcoin but perhaps are a discussion for cryptoanarchy.

Well, I'm not going to give you academic references ( I don't have any, and too lazy to go looking, sorry :) ), but is it not obvious why we use money instead of barter? That way we have to maintain N prices for N goods, instead of N^2 prices, not to mention we can choose a good for the 'hub' which has particularly ideal properties for that role, instead of exchanging food which can go off with couches which are cumbersome to carry around. etc.
To be fair, I'm sure you can come up with different comparisons between hub and spoke and many-many depending on what kind of entities are being connected, and want kind of properties you're looking for in the behaviour. But for the case of money, it seems obvious.
Hub and spoke does have the disadvantage of single point of failure though. That could be a counterargument.

No, the network is not reliable as a messenger. Messages can be intercepted and changed. Of course you're quite right that if messages can be trusted then the Byzantine generals problem doesn't arise.
Satoshi's solution is for how to establish concensus in an untrusted environment.
It's interesting to contemplate the fact that there is another solution in broad use for establishing trusted connections - SSL. This solution uses certificates to establish the authenticity of messages. Thus, if you can rely on trusted parties, you can easily solve the problem. This is how all earlier forms of financial transaction on the internet worked, and still work today. The problem with this approach is both politic and economic - trusted central parties can be attacked by those who don't want to allow the dispersion of power that digital cash represents, and must inevitably be more costly as resources are needed to maintain the integrity of the central counterparty.
All the same, even at a purely technical level, a fully peer to peer solution is seen as desirable, since a central counterparty is a central point of failure - a central server can go down, or be hacked. This is why the phrase "fault tolerant" is often used in connection with Byzantine systems. We want a system which does not fail even when messages get corrupted, however that corruption arises (even a noisy telephone line).

This forced me to really rethink what happens in a bitcoin transaction.
Bitcoin doesn't use encryption in its protocol; it uses *digital signatures*. Digital signatures represent proof that the message is constructed by the owner of a private key, *without revealing the private key*. Anyone who knows the public key can then verify that the owner of the corresponding private key was the one who sent it.
The content of the message, in the case of Bitcoin, is an instruction to transfer a certain amount of bitcoin from 1 or more unspent transactions that *you* own, to the owner of a different public key (in the most common type of transaction).
Once you've constructed the transaction, you can send it any way you want, to whomever you want. This is the whole idea - even using normal methods, your wallet software will send the transaction out to unknown, anonymous peers on the network.
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:30:29
No, to be fair to these people: in this case what is happening is that the government regulation effectively forced them to give their IDs to the exchange (so that the exchange could comply with AML/KYC), then the exchange got hacked and government ID was stolen.

It's kind of ironic that you have such a strong position in this regard when the entire original purpose of the idea of sidechains was to remove risk from Bitcoin itself by completely separating the operation of other layers (e.g. a fast transaction processing layer), instead of having them ride on top of the main chain, with all the problems that would mean in terms of scalability.
Side chains as envisaged can blow up in various ways, I guess - which is fine if you have no intention of using them, because they won't blow up the main chain.

Yeah we had long discussions about this back in Feb/March when Manfred Karrer was first figuring out how to set up bitsquare.
I think arguments based on 'people can't talk to each other' are dodgy. It would be great to create a situation where (a) the spend-outs from the 2 of 2 are constrained to be exactly in a desired ratio and (b) the sides of the contract never speak to each other after it's set up. But (a) is impossible outside of crazy 'coincovenant' type ideas (at least so I'm informed by core devs) and (b) is just not how the world works.
Like you say, maybe it could work for bots. It could also work in the context of a good reputation system, unicorn though such a thing may be. But strangers exchanging large value items; you're always going to be open to extortion attempts because spend-out from a 2 of 2 is just .. a matter of negotiation.

I believe it's more accurate to say that you're taking money from non-card users; businesses pass on the cost to the full price.
The most disadvantaged by the current system are those with the least political power (surprise, surprise): the poor, un[der]banked, and those with poor credit. It's effectively a tax on people who use cash in small amounts, which suits everyone at the top.
To be fair, it's probably also true that businesses lose out somewhat in favour of big financial entities like CC companies.

Read Greg Maxwell's original CoinJoin post on the btctalk forum. It's long but definitely worth the time.
Coinjoin is just a mechanism to unlink an input from an output. A tumbler would be repeated applications of coinjoin (actually I've never looked into how the existing centralized tumbler services work, but I presume that's at the heart of it). 
But they don't necessarily have to go together. Imagine a wallet that automatically did coinjoin for every spend from your wallet, but just once. Over time this would provide a lot of extra privacy. DarkWallet tried to do this, but so far that hasn't worked. JoinMarket as a project is trying to go a bit further in creating incentive mechanisms.
If you want to heavily unlink your utxos, and quickly, then you need tumbling, and as you say, that can involve a *lot* of extra transactions. Most people don't need that though (or I suppose they could do it, but rarely).
Joinmarket already has a tumbler script as well.

Some additional info on review:
The Firefox browser rebuild is done with gitian. Proper review of that would mean reviewing the patches to ssl3con.c and pkcs11c.c , then doing the deterministic rebuild to verify the hashes of the binary. These C files are part of NSS, they're the only changes we make to Firefox ESR 24.5 (we reuse the Tor gitian process, although it's *not* a Tor browser).
To understand what the application is doing in detail, you'll need to review the algorithm behind the secret splitting:  and then to understand the program function you can read:  .
In terms of reviewing the Python, as oakpacific said, the main application logic is in tlsnotary-auditor/ee.py . (Edit: you'll also need to review the javascript in data/FF-addon/tls*/../script.js and auditee.html and also in data/auditor/auditor.html and the background messaging in data/shared/irc_messaging.py at a minimum if you want to be thorough).
An additional element of the tech used is Luigi Auriemma's stcppipe, which we modded slightly (he included our updates to 0.4.8b on his page:  We also build stcppipe deterministically, so it can be verified.
Of course, I would be amazed if anyone did more than 10% of that initially, it's a ton of work. Ask us on  if there are things you're curious about.

Well, be unshocked, because everyone intimately involved with it is well aware of the potential of blockchains in addition to currency. What a lot of people *don't* seem to be aware of though is that the monetary value is *intrinsic* to the protocol. Trustless exchange of value is what Bitcoin is, at base. If you try to extract the money from the blockchain you (a)need to reintroduce trust to address the value exchange and (b)need to create another incentive. The security you talk about is not free, it has to be paid for in energy cost.
If you like, you can 'declare' that Bitcoin isn't money (as indeed many governments have done), but it doesn't matter - people will continue to use it first and foremost, because that's what it is, and how it was designed - digital cash. Other uses are based on that.
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:01:10
Yes. In a sense, you are asking "what is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin", and I know that raises hackles here because people insist either "all value is relative" or "there's no reason why a money has to have non-monetary value initially" (i.e. an objection to Mises' theorem).
I'm not arguing counter to that, but taking the concept of "intrinsic value" at its face, you *could* argue that there is an intrinsic value in the notarizing ability inherent in owning utxos that are spendable (i.e. coins that are spendable). It's a bit of a stretch, partly because that value doesn't exist absent the monetary value, because without Bitcoin having any monetary value, the network won't realistically have meaningful hashing power, which is required to create the necessary security for the notarizing value to exist. So there's a feedback loop there.

I was trying to point out that it's logically impossible for the merchant to be scammed if he/she receives an irreversible payment before shipping the goods.
A possible scam might exist if the merchant chose to accept unconfirmed transactions (see: "double spend"). It is extremely difficult to pull off, and it can be defended against - one of the main ways is to offset that risk to a payment processor.
But for internet retail type commerce, there is no need to ship the goods before 1-6 confirmations, thus removing the scam possibility.

One big problem with this concept is that 'fixed supply' makes no sense if one is going to just change to an entirely new supply every time an extra feature comes out. But, it's a quite debatable point. I think the concept of PoW is closely connected with this, but it's a bit murky.
A lot of analogies don't work; with consumer products, with social networks, with internet protocols - they all look superficially appealing in various ways, but they can all lead you on the wrong track.


Far more than you might expect, that isn't true; most haven't been stressed tested in security or performance or scalability; especially on the last two, a lot of "2nd generation" that look great on the surface are actually awful.

Taking the emotion out for a minute, this is of course one of *the* hard problems of governance in a technological society. I think for society at large, neither extreme can work: you can't have democratic votes on the exact chemical composition of the control rods in the reactor, but neither can you have the decision to have a nuclear power plant taken totally out of the people's hands. But the thing is, in that analogy, segwit, like the soft forks before it for OP_CSV and OP_CLTV are much more like deciding on boron control rods, than they are like "shall we have this company install a plant here?" - they're not something the general public can possibly decide on.
Tone Vays knows little or nothing about the topic (sorry but let's be real), so he's not really the right advocate - but the really thorny question is, how could you possibly decide? If you can't read and understand [this]( (which, by the way is a deliberately dumbed down and simplified version compared to BIP141+), then you have no real way to make an informed decision.
I'm not saying there's an easy answer here, but please remember Bitcoin is an *open source* project where hundreds (even thousands?) of experts all around the world contribute. It's not "the Core team" or "Blockstream", nobody controls it.
@_date: 2017-02-11 14:00:29
Yes, the best path to this is Schnorr signatures, at least in the short term; segwit makes this a lot easier.
Schnorr signatures are kind of magic: e.g. 100 signatures embedded in one. Signatures are the crucial part of blockchain bloat.
I don't think it's quite at the level of a no-brainer though, even post-segwit; there has been some pretty high level crypto work in ensuring that it can be done correctly (and there's an interactivity issue).
Edit: forgot to add, Lightning, or payment channels generally, are likely to give fungibility a significant boost in a much less expensive way, although like a lot of things the really good effects will come with broad-ish adoption.
Tumblebit is very good too, probably the best way to put it is it achieves decent fungibility with less on-chain effects than, say, coinjoin (which needs a lot of txs). Like existing mixers but without the horrible trust model.
The worst thing is just weak obfuscation by doing tons of peel transactions. Not only does it give rise to severe bloat, but it doesn't really work.

Ultimately I agree, but we're a little way off from Lightning being usable. Bridging the gap isn't bad, and there's an argument for somewhat increasing scale if it can be done safely with inherent *scalability* improvements to offset, as SW to some extent does.
Sidechains - you can debate about ways they might help scalability (note Pieter Wuille specifically doesn't consider them a scalability solution, although I can see alternative views on that), but we don't have a trustless version of that today. But, we'll see.

For those who didn't quite get the point of your OP, you're probably just confusing them more by mentioning Tor (although you certainly have a valid point there).
The main concept is that when you use https you have 'authentication' : your browser is checking that every packet comes from the server that owns that certificate (the certificate listed inside the padlock). When you use http, it's not, so you just have to hope that (a) your dns is working right and you sent your request for data to the right IP address and (b) nobody is tampering with the data along the path it took from the server to your machine. Maybe a nefarious employee at your ISP for example? And bitcoin is the easiest possible use case for such an attack: just change the bitcoin address/QR code, nothing else - profit.

Most likely given what you describe: you had already installed Electrum at some point in the past. Check for a .electrum in your home folder if on Linux, similar for Mac and Win (whatever is the default location for application data).
As for "too confusing". Honestly, just no. But hey, if you like the idea of constantly having to back-up and re-back-up your wallets again and again, always worrying about hard drive failures, be my guest :)
Actually, just thought of something - are you currently using a desktop wallet, or a web wallet? If the latter, then I could well imagine finding Electrum a bit scary/confusing. But all the other options would be pretty similar in that regard.

Segwit creates one very viable path to improved fungibility - Schnorr sigs leading to economic incentives to more fungibility, which is crucial because it provides a perfectly valid non-privacy related reason for it (sad but true that this matters), and it also accelerates Lightning channels, which will take a lot of transaction metadata off the blockchain (not a panacea, but a help). So at the moment both scalability and fungibility would be greatly helped by segwit.

Well, it is *mainly* that case. But you must consider that this might include government or quasi-government agencies (in certain more dystopian futures). Even today, when I cross an international border, I am much more peaceful knowing that such agencies have not even the theoretical possibility of seeing my wallet, because it exists only in my memory (that's why I prefer the brainwallet concept to the steganographic concept).
The reason I say "mainly": knowledge is always useful. The hacker who discovers a wallet.dat can talk to the thugs in his gang, who can come round to your house and reinstigate the gun-at-the-head scenario. Less likely but also conceivable is the case where the hacker knows of a RNG vulnerability with certain flavours of bitcoin wallet software and combines this with searching for the right kind of encrypted wallet. There are more complex (but less likely scenarios) that I haven't even thought of. So steganography is not just for fun, including in this case. It is a very significant extra layer of defence.

Standard transaction fees for the latest version of bitcoin (0.9.1) are  0.00001 btc, which is about  half a cent. A lot of clients are still using 0.0001 as a standard, or 0.0002, which is about 5-10c.
Also, you are using Coinbase, which will have its own policy about transaction fees.
"Raw" bitcoin (direct transfers on the network) microtransactions are unlikely to ever be very practical on the network without playing some tricks here and there. E.g.:  (1) bundling lots of transactions into 1 to reduce fees per user, and (2) creating off-chain transaction systems.
If you're wondering why can't we just have free transactions, there are two problems: (1) DOS attacks - the whole system can easily be choked up with fake transactions if they cost nothing to create and (2) miner rewards are very large today, but what incentive will miners have to mine the network when they become very small. (I actually only think (1) is a real problem here, but it's a very important one)

@_date: 2017-02-13 11:43:11


The size in current Bitcoin is from the signatures, and generally the scriptSigs, on the inputs; the outputs (p2pkh or p2sh) are small.




CT is a different model, but it's worse than that; in the original implementation a typical *output* (not input) is about 2.5kB (cf current outputs in the tens of bytes), consisting of pedersen commitments to digits and range proofs (basically a large combination of ring signatures). This provides satoshi level granularity up to 42BTC iirc (32 bit). There are two improvements: 1, some recent work by Back and others has lopped off some linear fraction, e.g. 20-25% from the size, and second, you could handle smaller ranges than 0-42btc to reduce the size, but those gains even worse than linear, it's logarithmic, so suffers from rapidly diminishing returns.
So as of now it's reasonable to say it's not a practical on-chain technology (sidechain is different of course). Research is ongoing afaik.

Again and again this ... have you actually thought carefully about this? What makes bitcoins "expensive"? You can buy exactly as much as you want to buy, $10 worth or $50,000 worth, and its purchasing power is exactly that of the fiat you exchanged for it.

Yes, basically, the scenario of no block rewards is completely uncharted territory. Be aware though, that it's more than 5 years until the reward drops even below 10 bitcoins per 10 minutes, and a couple of decades before it drops below 1 per 10 minutes.
The way I've always seen it, you have to look at a success or failure scenario: success means the value of BTC goes (way) up, meaning "lower" rewards may well have higher real world value. If BTC fails as a currency, then mining will drop off anyway, so it almost doesn't matter that the reward drops over time. It's a delicate balance, though, for sure; Adam Back said that he thought what really made bitcoin work was that it got the inflation schedule right.

What is 'one' in this sentence? If you mean what does a Bitcoin look like, the answer is nothing; there is no such thing as 'a Bitcoin'. What there are is unspent outputs. The entries in the ledger are transactions, and the outputs from transactions are the nearest analogy to 'coins' or the spendable money in the system. Here's an example of a transaction:

I'm probably not alone in disagreeing with Peter's position on the possibility of government sponsored 51% attack. I see absolutely no realistic scenario in which that would come about.
Imagine if all the practical difficulties with such a plan were overcome - just how obvious and transparent would the intellectual and ethical bankruptcy of such a decision be? And even if you claim that that wouldn't matter in certain totalitarian states, OK, but how much egg on their face would they have when people en masse found a way to fork and ignore those miners, or switched to a new altcoin, or whatever is the simplest way to make such an enormous undertaking irrelevant? 
These are just two objections to the idea, there are others.
@_date: 2015-05-10 07:33:17
Yes, the Bitcoin blockchain (or any blockchain with similarly huge hashing power) has a unique feature that the entries buried under sufficient* blocks are computationally infeasible to alter. 
Simply making a database or set of records which an attacker can't overwrite is nothing special; any organization could do that. But making such a record that *nobody* can overwrite is genuinely a new thing.
 \* 'sufficient' - see section 11 of the whitepaper for a discussion of how many blocks are enough.

The problem is whether they think short term - and that's not to insult them, it may just be the nature of the business (e.g. short life of equipment). More fees today might be rational to them even if over a longer term it degrades the perceived value of the currency.
The other huge problem is that if fabrication of ASICs is too centralized (well, it is), and *if* that creates a scenario where effectively, control of hashing power is in too few hands, then that's a huge security risk to the network if powerful political actors can influence them (e.g. govt authorities).
I really think a change-POW option should ideally be sitting ready to go in the event of an emergency. Maybe it's really difficult to set that up, and maybe it seems impractical, but it would be helpful if it were there.

Sorry, but what are you talking about? What status do you think the miners have such that developer actions should be taken as insults? You've just spent time explaining how they are essentially like farmers/ farm animals/ docile (similar to what you said in the video).

Miners are supposed to be anonymous, and were never intended to be in a political dialogue about development of the protocol!

I actually doubt that it's correct, even though there was a huge bubble in altcoins ~ Jan 2014, even compared with Bitcoin which had also surged of course.
The reason I'm skeptical is partly because a lot of calculations go off "market cap" which is a kind of absurd metric (e.g. you launch your coin with 1B units, trade 1 unit at a dollar, and you have "$1B stored" in it. this is a particular problem for non-mineable currencies like Ripple, but not only).

Some people just think the basic idea of joinmarket, using economic incentive but not having any persistence of identity (and so no reputation scores) is not a good one, either. That's something else that could be discussed.
Re: safety, I think we have a pretty decent record of not losing people's coins over 2 years. I'm not aware of even one instance*. Partly, that's kind of inherent to coinjoin - the coins either arrive or they don't. Not that there aren't potential vectors for things to go wrong, there are, mentioned below. And even just generally, I think your point is valid - don't trust large amounts of money to code that isn't extremely high quality and well audited etc.
Even in a scenario of super-audited code, though, this is a hot wallet, so that must be borne in mind when considering the security issues. Such a thing is always risky to use.
\* If that seems a bit dubious, I can offer a memory of three distinct things that almost reach to the level of "code lost people's coins", but didn't: (1) one person paid a 50% fee on a transaction *very* early on (like summer 2015), due to not reading the fee (we made the warning much more aggressive after that) - this was by far the worst one - but *technically* user error, (2) someone sent coins to an insecure wallet seed, I grabbed the coins, bug was fixed and sent back, (3) there was a flat out bug in the tx preparation code that *could* allow a malicious participant to claim a higher fee than expected, but thankfully it was fixed before it was ever exploited.

AFAIK that was specifically created in attempt to counter the vast swathes of misinformation against it.
Segwit is a minimally disruptive (soft fork, not a dangerous hard fork), and yet very powerful upgrade to Bitcoin that provides a blocksize increase and some scalability improvements (while unlocking the possibility of further scalability improvements), and fixes a central underlying bug in the original design. There have been no rational arguments against it, instead just a lot of misinformation (often, direct falsehoods), which less informed people have bought because they don't understand it, while they do understand something simple like "block size increase" or even the far worse "emergent consensus" - but they don't understand the implications.
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:38:46


False. Segwit increases the blocksize by 70-110% immediately (it can go bigger than this too). It also allows payment channels which would mean *trustless, nearly free and nearly instant* transactions although that's complicated and will still take some time (although the groundwork has already been laid, and it practically requires segwit). Segwit also provides other scalability improvements. See e.g. 


False. Bitcoin is an open source project with 100+ completely voluntary contributors. Some of the most active ones are now employed by Blockstream, many are not. Others are employed by other companies, some by none. In this it is like most other big open source projects.


False, see e.g. 


It fixes a fundamental bug in the code. Every update changes the code generally. Re your 'moot' point, yes.


This one I would also count as basically completely 'False'. Hard forks require overwhelming consensus as they create new rules and require *everyone* to upgrade (users as well as miners). As to whether there have been hard forks in the past, I have heard from experts that actually there have not, but it depends on the details of the technical definition of 'hard fork'. What is true is that early in Bitcoin's life Satoshi propagated updates by 'central command' so to speak, for urgent bugfixes, but these were not controversial because they were critical security fixes - that does not apply to a controversial architecture change like this. Soft forks are a safer way to increase capacity, as they don't require everyone to use them immediately - that's what segwit allows.


This is the only one that has merit imo - albeit it's based on just one forum post, perhaps one or two other comments. However, he also proposed the general idea of payment channels for scaling. He did not foresee a lot of things that matter, e.g. pooled mining, which affects the centralization pressure. Ultimately, his voice has less weight considering how long it has been since he was even involved, and the system has since changed drastically. He also made strong statements about the dangers of alternate clients, calling them 'a menace to the network'.
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:25:51


Not by means of coinjoin; certainly, one transaction can be a clearing transaction for an off-chain network (e.g. a Bitcoin exchange settling a lot of daytraders accounts), but coinjoin itself will not allow more than a small number without hitting the hard limits on transaction size (not sure what the absolute limit is for one transaction, but it's for sure less than 1MB today :) )

It does increase the block size cap, because the number of bytes passed over the wire in a block is increased. The witness data is inside the serialized transaction, it is included in the block. The effect of using max_weight is that more transactions are allowed to be included in a block.
"Makes more efficient use of existing space". No, sorry, you've been misled. Have you implemented segwit in code? I have, there is no ambiguity here, it is simply fact - segwit allows bigger blocks, there have been blocks of size 3.7MB propagated in testnet.

I don't think it's literally the same thing, but I've made a similar point before. Many years ago we had systems based on these kinds of ideas, "financial cryptography", as well as OT, before that there was Loom and a couple of others whose names I've forgotten. Crypto can do a lot for finance outside of p2p trustless digital cash. But unless you say "blockchain" you don't get showered with investment cash, which is a testament to Bitcoin's success, really.

I may be wrong, but I believe Litecoin is ASIC controlled now, and the same community of miners (mostly in China?) have the hash majority, if so, it seems at least possible, and maybe probable, they'll block it there too. Interesting times.
Also, it's ridiculous to think that a test on Litecoin proves anything over and above the huge amount of testing it's already had on Bitcoin testnets (plural). They could easily screw something up, it would prove nothing (plus, they don't have the tx volume that'd show much of anything on the scalability front). Not saying I'm against the idea at all - if nothing else it could be a playground for Lightning network testing - that might be useful.

Yeah, I read it when it came out, and like most of Vitalik's writing, I find it very interesting. I don't think it changes the fundamental nature of proof of work as being an objective mechanism, I think he is trying to build an argument that that objectivity isn't necessary. I don't agree. In particular I think this point is not valid:


What this overlooks is self-verifying property of proofs of work. A stag's antlers are objectively "this big", and can be verified as different from others based on this. Bitcoin block hashes have objectively "this much" work embedded (not just in their own hash, but back down the linked list). That "self-verifying" element is critical: it means I only need to see *one* copy of the true chain to be alerted that something is wrong (I still might be in trouble if swamped by Sybils, but I'd at least have a chance). That's not true otherwise. Seeing one disagreeing hash from a node doesn't tell me much if it's not using PoW; it's probably just a miscreant. So other consensus mechanisms for the list of block hashes can't have that property, because nothing digital does: there are an infinite number of possible histories. Only a physical mechanism can have that property of being genuinely *difficult* to replicate. Proof of work *reifies* digital patterns.
Buterin, I think, in that article is trying to come up with a good *distributed* consensus, but that's never going to have the same dynamic properties as a self-verifying consensus from proof of work.
See e.g. this part: 


That's what Bitcoin (attempts to) change: yes, consensus is by definition social (a property of a group of parties), but the dynamics of consensus is radically different for things that can be *objectively verified*. It's much stickier.

Although it's true the risk is reversed, I'd argue it's much more natural this way round. The merchant is a very public entity, often with an address, a business license etc. The customer is an ephemeral identity (even more so with Bitcoin than before, of course).
Of course as Sheep Marketplace et al. show it isn't always this way; caveat emptor is still incredibly important.
@_date: 2014-11-14 08:43:05
Having seen your discussion with Natanael, I can basically confirm what Natanael is saying, but maybe it's worth putting it in another way: the bank appends a cryptographic signature to every chunk of data it sends (TLS records). It's not technically a signature, but for the purposes of this argument let's say it is. Now, to make that signature you need the key. In normal TLS both sides, client and server, have that key, but no one else should have it, so when the client receives data with a correct signature he knows it's from the bank and was not intercepted along the way. Notice that the client could create fake server traffic, but who's he going to send it to? It would be pointless.
Now, in TLSNotary, the bank still has that signature key as normal, but something weird is happening on the client side: the auditor and auditee each have half of the "key material" to make that key, but the auditor has temporarily withheld his half, so at this stage neither the auditee nor the auditor can make fake server traffic. So even if the auditee is horribly pwned, or a horrible liar, the auditor will never believe what he's receiving unless it's coming from the bank - because at that moment in the protocol, only the bank has a key that produces a valid signature.
Notice that this means we can't check the 'signature' immediately. That's fine. We require a commitment of the server traffic, then, after the connection is closed, we reveal this server signature key (actually 'server hmac key' or 'server mac write secret') and reveal the server traffic, and if the key doesn't produce a valid signature for the traffic, we reject the audit as invalid.

"not anonymous at all" is the current narrative that everyone says, but it's a terrible oversimplification.
If it's "not anonymous at all", I presume you can tell me who took all of MtGox's bitcoins, all of sheep market's bitcoins etc etc.
As to "average Joe won't care", I get your point - that it takes effort to create really good privacy. That's true, but my counterpoint is - wallets can be designed to make it work correctly (step 1 - not reusing addresses) without extra effort.
Most of the deanonymising that goes on in practice is because people are going fiat-bitcoin-fiat, i.e. it's not a Bitcoin problem in the first place.
The point I think people are not focusing enough on is the irreversibility and censorship resistance. When you pass cash notes from one person to another, no third party can prevent it from happening. I think it's the loss of this feature that we should be most worried about, and that feature is maintained with Bitcoin as cash.

Four relevant points:
1/ segwit already is 2MB blocks, and is a soft fork
2/ HF 2MB + segwit means the *potential* to create blocks of near 8MB size; that wouldn't happen naturally of course, today, but you have to think adversarially: a miner could create such a block maliciously, and the question is whether such huge blocks could cause problems with verification, propagation
3/ Hard forks are incredibly problematic unless they have *overwhelming* consensus. We don't have that on block size.
4/ The ETH case is different, qualitatively, in that ETH was always intended as a much more experimental network than BTC. They ditched immutability entirely on the main chain but while it was a big problem, it wasn't the end of their network. I think it might be close to death for bitcoin, whose value is entirely predicated on immutability and safety of transfers. Also, hardforks are much less problematic with quick difficulty adjustment, which Bitcoin by design doesn't have (2 weeks before diff change).
@_date: 2017-02-19 14:00:10
Sorry wasn't thinking about the documentary, but in general you'll see unconfirmed transactions broadcast on the network near-immediately. And to be fair, there are *many* situations where in practice, seeing the unconfirmed transaction is enough for your needs (good example: buy a digital service like a VPN online; it doesn't matter if the tx isn't confirmed, because if the transaction gets double spent, the vendor can simply withdraw the service. another example might be if you're buying a low value item, like a drink in a restaurant, then it isn't really worth the restaurant's time defending against double spend, for such low value). In *general* you need to wait for minimum 1, and preferably more confirmations, before accepting a payment. As for fees, the wallet handles that for you; a couple of years ago it might have been as little as 5cents, but now with higher BTC price and much more network usage, the fee is more likely to be in the 20-40c range for example (depending on various factors). But whatever it is, good wallets will calculate it for you.
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:05:37
I think 2MB only would be far less controversial (*if* a softfork), while still somewhat controversial. But remember segwit *allows* up to near-4MB, and pay attention to malicious behaviour. This is one reason why people thinking "2MB+segwit HF" is a sensible compromise are wrong; that's a near 8MB limit.

I heard that to use the ZKP features you need to use a ton of RAM/CPU just to create the transaction(?) Something like that, if so, it's not scalability in the way we usually think of it, but something similar. Perhaps more "usability". (and not discounting that it might *also* have bad scalability, I'm also not in the know about that part).
There seems to be all sorts of awkwardness in all of the crypto schemes that give stronger anonymity and fungibility properties. Storage footprint, memory/cpu footprint, interactivity - it doesn't yet seem possible to find something that doesn't fall down in one of these areas.

It's not a replacement for the current PKI/cert authorities (certainly not a replacement for TLS, which relies on certificates but is agnostic about trust). It just adds a much needed feature to self-signed certs, which aren't used much (browsers don't trust them, and can't realistically).

Amir is still on the unsystem mailing list sometimes. He's no longer interested in Bitcoin stuff, got involved in Rojava and other political stuff afaik.
It's interesting to me that a lot of the old anarchist element in Bitcoin got kind of disillusioned with it. Those that are still interested in it have often moved on to various altcoins because they don't like the governance. To me it's a lot of fantasising - money cannot be about democracy or any kind of governance model, money is *fundamentally* about the fact that social governance fails at scale (see: Dunbar number). If you try to throw a "governance model" onto *coin it will just devolve into what we already have with fiat money, eventually. It will get coopted.
Personally I've always thought all that anarchism, anarcho-* stuff is just games. Nothing will change in global society from that. Bitcoin (and *maybe* other p2p technology more broadly) is much more likely to make an actual change in society by striking at the root - the control of the printing press, to put it crudely. But even that could be quite a fantasy too, unless Bitcoin manages to get strong enough, unmalleable enough, at its base layer.

About fixed output sizes: that is one model, however you can go with a model where one person wants to "join" a fixed amount, and others have at least that amount available in their utxos. Then, that fixed amount will be "joined", but the change outputs will be linkable. E.g. in the tx I linked above, the change output 14v can be seen to come from 1ARU , but the three 0.01 outputs cannot be distinguished.

I get your point that I'm waffling a bit. But I think this sentence here is probably where we disagree. RSA 2048+ (in my opinion!) is unbreakable today. Even this isn't *proven*, but a huge amount of work has gone into trying to break it (obv. here we're talking about computational security, not against unbounded computation). The situation with ECC is similar. People who know a lot more than me have even been known to say ECC is probably stronger.
I think you're basically saying "not proven to be unbreakable = breakable". True in theory, but obfuscates the real situation hugely.
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:31:50


I disagree, if you use a 12 word mnemonic for a deterministic wallet a la Electrum / BIP 39 (nowadays a lot of wallets and services use it).
Offline signing is certainly possible. The paper wallet multiple withdrawal problem is entirely removed by using a deterministic wallet.
As for the brain injury, true, that's a risk whenever you have exclusive control. Memory failure can be partially addressed by writing down the wallet seed somewhere.

Re the first one, the article states "how they got caught when their ID where linked to their IP’s, Coinbase &amp; Bank accounts :" &lt;- not blockchain analysis.
Re the second one, I remember reading it before, what's notable is that the guy was caught precisely through fiat activities. Whether blockchain analysis was involved I don't know, but I doubt it: I specifically remember at the time of the exit scam (was it early 2014? don't remember) people were trying, and failing, to keep track of all the coins on the blockchain as they were peeled across thousands of addresses.

The same ones that protect other applications of public key cryptography. We don't have formal proofs of the computational hardness of the ECDLP or the DLP, but obviously a lot of work has been done there, and it's used by basically the entire internet. Similarly for the first and second preimage resistance of SHA256 (although I wonder what the theoretical status of that is; all I know is that every cryptographer out there seems to be remarkably confident about its strength).
Breaks in TLS are an entirely different order of problem to breaks in the underlying primitives (like: DH key exchange, RSA, AES etc.). It's worth mentioning, because it's so often glossed over, that things like Lucky 13, BEAST etc. , while important breaks, were not actually used to hack real world websites anyway; they're part of a class of what are called "padding oracle attacks", which afair originate from Bleichenbacher's idea, sometimes crudely called the "million message attack" - it's fundamentally dependent on being able to ping a server a ridiculous amount of times. 
Point? That the theoretical breaks are not always practically relevant. Meanwhile the really horrible problems like Heartbleed are coding errors, but imo the real issue is the huge Byzantine mess of supporting a wide range of cipher suites and extensions in TLS (Heartbleed is in DTLS). And the third class - Logjam for example - are a direct consequence of government weakening; but again, it was weakening of the TLS protocol, not the underlying primitives, and again it comes out of the "let's dump everything possible into this protocol to satisfy everyone".
A little appreciated feature of Bitcoin, imo, is exactly how simple the crypto is. Almost all the complexity is in Bitcoin Script, and it's notable that Satoshi deliberately disabled almost all the interesting OP codes out of paranoia.
Btw this is why I really want sidechains to happen. People are in the phase of wanting to build fancy stuff on Bitcoin; we should be paranoid about them doing it on the main chain.
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:40:02
It's about (a) hashing power (b) software development network effect. Higher hashing power = more security (more difficult to attack). Software development: Bitcoin has most of the best software developers in the field (nebulous point, arguable) but more concretely, it has a huge amount of software infrastructure built up around it.
Amongst most of us, it is tacitly understood that "you can't have the blockchain without Bitcoin" really means you can't have a secure and decentralised/trustless blockchain without a unit of account that has value. So technically, yes, they could use dogecoin instead.

Currently joinmarket is running on mainnet, but it's early days; e.g. yesterday people were worried that they'd lost coins because of small bug in the wallet display script (of course, they hadn't).
I mention it to illustrate the point that there's still a fair amount of ground to cover, even though it *is* true that you can start running it now on real joins (and indeed we are having txs going through, mostly small of course).
So if you want to run it and take part you'll need to be patient in set up. I doubt it's very practical to run on anything but Linux, although OSX might be fine (any reports?). Windows is def *possible*, but you'll have to mess around installing stuff like libsodium.
Addressing the usability for non-technical users is going to take a while. One direction is the electrum plugin idea: see [issue 44]( on github.
I remember also there was talk of bundling into one of the mobile wallets, discussions were had but I don't know the details.
And to address the actual topic :) , yes all kinds of help in dev would be appreciated. I have not been helping out the last month or two, belcher has been working almost all on his own. Now we've gone to main net we're getting a few more people submitting PRs, but there's a ton to do (see the Issues list).
Another is simply to bundle up executables, especially for Win. I was kind of thinking of doing that a month ago, but never got round to it (maybe it was too early anyway).
So you see for now it's a techie person's tool. I think it's quite natural to start like that; a small pool of people finding bugs here and there.

I'm pretty sure that you're seeing a post from April 2013, when very briefly the price spiked above $150 (to a max of $260) over a period of a day or two. This coincided as I recall with the time when a lot of people were making crazy tips (basically as soon as the price went over $100 everyone lost it a bit).
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:17:27


Yes. Bitcoin is digital *cash*, so it's not appropriate to compare. You can build reversible services, with consumer protection, on top of Bitcoin, just as you can with cash (or gold for that matter, which has other limitations). I did say (in some other comment), that it was quip, as well as having an important point, to mention the long settlement time of credit cards. It has advantages and disadvantages. But people who compare Bitcoin versus credit cards both unfavourably and favourably, are usually missing the point, Bitcoin should be compared with cash, if anything.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:49:56
You definitely have a point that it's easy to start, but difficult to do well. This is really about the interplay between open source/free software development on one side, and the sensitivity of writing good financial, security and cryptography software. My point being it's not limited to Bitcoin - see the recent heartbleed fiasco in openssl.
About multisignature, it's kind of tricky; at one level implementing it is dead simple, not much above ordinary transactions. But the complications it can add to the workflow and the user experience I guess are at least a bit demanding. Still, some exchanges and wallets have already done this. I don't think it's *nearly* as hard as making a public facing Bitcoin service secure - now *that's* seriously hard.

Well, it's not really a matter of years, it's a matter of usage, right. In a sense, it's almost a tautology to say 'it can keep working this way for a while', because of course nobody will be foolish enough to try to create a payment system for the mass market using it directly, as long as it clearly doesn't scale up enough.
But in a sense that misses the point; people *can* design a mass market payment system *around* Bitcoin, using it as a base layer with another layer on top. The only problem is that there need to be trust points in that case (which don't forget can have positives as well as negatives).

Apologies if I'm being a bit obtuse, but it just comes down to: you don't own anything in the current system, you have zero autonomy. That's what Bitcoin is intended to address, but of course it only does so when you actually have the bitcoin yourself. Up until that point, you can only hope for the best.

I believe that Wilson is wrong to be thinking in terms of a "stack". You certainly can build like that, upwards (see e.g. Counterparty), but I don't think long term that that's going to work well. The internet is built as a stack because the network interaction is point-to-point; each message has a sender and a receiver. But Bitcoin is fundamentally *broadcast* - every node has to get every message, and also each message has to be checked with an expensive (relatively speaking) ecdsa verification. So it doesn't scale to millions of messages per second. That's why I hope that sidechains can work well, because then we can get real scalability while preserving the scarcity promise of Bitcoin.

I don't think Bitcoin has anything to learn from Digicash. It seems patently obvious that Bitcoin was designed specifically to avoid that scenario.
If Zooko wants to help Bitcoin he should consider joining in the effort to make it succeed, e.g. by working on sidechain solutions instead of adding to the endless stream of altcoins (and moreover, for profit: which would guarantee a shutdown or arrest, ironically, just like the other alternative moneys that preceded Bitcoin and which it learned from, e.g. egold, except that Bitcoin's precedent has made the state's job in shutting such things down more difficult).

The scenario you depict is vastly better than the scenario in which the base layer is centralized, even if the base layer is not accessible directly due to large fees, because it means that there will always be a way to get censorship-resistant transfer; if one centralized "bank" entity refuses to deal with you, another one will be able to profit by doing so. New "clearing" entities, let's call them Bitcoin banks, will always be able to arise, because nobody can control their access to the chain.
Censorship resistance can easily bubble up through the layers like that; but it struggles to go downwards. That asymmetry is very fundamental. Imagine if the base layer were in the control of "the government" (whatever that means). To get uncensored payments, you'd want to pass payments into that govt. controlled layer such that they don't know the identities of the payer and payee say. We kind of have that today with physical cash notes - but notice how every year it becomes more and more difficult to do anonymous payment; everything is tracked, cash is being stamped out etc. And if you want to transfer across jurisdictions, you have no choice but to provide ID and get blocked if your govt feels like it.
(I'm specifically addressing the "Bitcoin bank" scenario, not the Lightning network type scenario which of course in principle is far better).

But as for Core devs, I guess you were talking about discussions of PoW change; I think any bitcoiner of any persuasion would have to agree that this is at least a reasonable thing to *discuss*, since in the current climate it is not at all beyond possibility that a state actor could take control of the majority of mining power somehow or other. In the case of an existential threat, we would have to do something like that.

If they do the analysis carefully and honestly, they will see that by far the best way to use bitcoin's blockchain technology for money transfer is - to actually use the existing bitcoin network.
The reason for this is (a) the enormous hashing power means Bitcoin is the safest blockchain (the 10 min confirm time is also a big help for them - it makes forks incredibly unlikely), and (b) creating their own separate or private blockchain would be an utter waste of time, as they can make (and already have made) a transfer network much more efficiently without a blockchain, because they have centralized control.
I've said many times on here I see Bitcoin as much as a replacement for SWIFT as anything else. Lightweight, cheap, reliable and perfectly neutral.

That's an interesting way of looking at it; it could be that the 2 or 3 bubbles that seemed to be coming from certain user groups were just aftereffects of this root cause - that technological dislocations, allowing a small group of winners to mine a large chunk of btc with near zero cost, created a steady dearth of supply (see e.g. the steady rise from late 2012 to early 2013.

It's not a lack of knowledge. It's a gut reaction. They know that digital things are cheap to copy or fake, and should not be trusted as real.

There are lots of corporate forms of money already. What none of them have is a broad set of features that might be called 'neutrality' - irreversible payment, non-confiscatability, non-blockability. Nobody can control the Bitcoin network 'by fiat'. A few US senators were able to block payments to Wikileaks via Mastercard/Visa/Paypal exactly like that.
The Bitcoin network could be controlled by taking over its mining power. However not only is this expensive, but it takes a lot of sophisticated effort over time. It would be really difficult for even the powerful to do this in sufficient secret, and at the end of it it would become obvious and we would all switch to a non-co-opted coin, rendering the effort useless. The more you flesh it out the more you realise it's not a realistic scenario, mainly because of the openness of the protocol (everyone sees everything that happens).
Sorry drifted slightly away from your question :) A corporation will never be able to (let alone want to) create that kind of money; it will want/need control and the government will oversee it.

OK, so you mean the second of the two options. 
I think I get what you mean; you're saying that there is always an advantage in issuing an asset with no legal encumbrance (because if you didn't people would prefer to use another asset which didn't have an encumbrance). But I'm still not sure I see how that gives a motivation for a central bank to use a blockchain.

You two are arguing at cross purposes. Clearly a ceiling of a CB's currency x-rate against another currency can be maintained indefinitely in theory. Equally clearly, there can be disastrous consequences to such a policy so in practice it would not be maintained indefinitely without reference to those consequences.

Yeah, bitcoin muddies the waters: it isn't perfectly fungible, nor is it perfectly traceable. The reason it's not perfectly traceable is because there is no actual 'coin' object - you can have multi-in, multi-out transactions (see coinjoin) which removes the ability to completely trace the flow of money.

@_date: 2016-03-21 12:57:02


Yes and no, but mostly no, especially if "by analysing values alone". The point is that equal outputs in a coinjoin are *fundamentally* indistinguishable. You can read some analysis of the joinmarket case (which is weaker than some implementations and stronger than others) in my doc [here]( although it's looking at a very specific scenario, but there's also some background that might be interesting.
As for CT, I think an order of magnitude size difference, or more, is big enough that it really matters quite a lot. There's a tradeoff in how big you choose to make it, against the level of amount privacy you get (basically larger range of privacy-&gt; more digits in base 4 amount -&gt; more signatures needed in ring sig).
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:40:01
Right. Sending change to different levels/depths in a HD wallet (as has done in joinmarket), or tagging change outputs, to avoid merge, is clearly doable. It is clearly useful to warn people that that kind of merging ruins joining, but let's be clear it's not a hole in the idea of CoinJoin per se.
Using fixed denominations with rounding sent to miners could be done in Bitcoin if that model is preferred. 
Re: DOS attack, of course it is always easier to address with a trusted third party ("master node") than in a decentralized model. Using a collateral transaction is interesting, but if you fall back on a TTP then there's a whole bunch of things you can do better - as long as you actually trust the TP!

OK, got it. Reference to OP_RETURN was quite pro-like :)
OP_RETURN is a way of putting data on the blockchain, and would have the effect of proving ownership, but it's simpler to make an ECDSA signature using the private key of the address, and then sending that data out (no blockchain involvement). Many wallets have this functionality built in, so it's easy to do.

Hard to say; it's technically possible. For example, if the page is a response to a POST request there's nothing stopping a server from responding differently to the second POST compared with the first (they can keep track of state at the application level). 
Generally that doesn't happen though, from testing.
What's much more likely is that content is delivered dynamically. TLSNotary doesn't work for absolutely any https page. That's one of the main reasons we have a "self-test" function, so you can check if your particular webpage that you want audited actually works. And here 'failure' generally just means the info on the page just doesn't show up.

It's because (a) there's no barrier to entry (this is an open source/ free software feature, rather than Bitcoin-specific) and (b) there's usually a financial incentive. That's inevitably going to create a vast swathe of attempts at doing something, only a small proportion of which are worth anyone's attention. And then, there's very few people interested in engaging with nascent projects, and contributing any of their own time, so even if they're worthwhile they'll get very little attention.

That's a good question. Have you considered bitpay? I'm sure they'd have an answer for this. Are you in a position to communicate to your customers that they need to pay (x) minimum transaction fee to ensure smooth processing? E.g. on a website. If so, then if they don't, you're in your rights to make them wait.
The good news is 99% of wallets out there make it difficult (or even impossible) to try to send out zero fee transactions. But still, it's a good question I think, I'd like to hear others' opinions.

No, your argument is the wrong way round. Bitcoin exists precisely *because* of this tendency by the powerful to suppress alternative currencies. Look at egold. Look at liberty reserve.

So far it has entirely lived up to that promise.

Look at  for an example of the kind of structure we think can work; you have traders meeting on a DHT. Use multisig with 3rd key owned by an arbitrator. The multisig part is easy enough.
Decentralised, yes, but not 100% trustless - the remaining trust is that the arbitrator is not colluding with your counterparty. But it's still a much better model than centralised exchange. A similar structure is being used with openbazaar. You can have arbitrators, but they're in a free market, instead of having to trust a centralized exchange to be your arbiter, with no choice.

ECDH is extremely widely used in modern day TLS (and not only, by any means). You may well be using it right now in your browser.
Key exchange is only part of the story if you want to do encrypted messaging, though; as the Wiki link describes, usually you're going to negotiate a key for symmetric encryption using that.
To do the message encryption directly with EC keys (like Bitcoin keys) is another story. There is a protocol called ECIES which can in principle do that, but there have been issues when people have tried that in the past (paging .. although probably he wouldn't bother himself with this).

Yes, and this is why export shenanigans (especially accounting tricks in Hong Kong) have been a big issue w.r.t capital flight; if companies follow the rules, they are forced to sell USD received for exports for RMB to the banks (so the banks accumulate the foreign reserve holdings) according to various convoluted rules. But the details aren't the point; the point is that these financial dealings are under state control, whereas when the RMB is converted to BTC they lose control, at least generally.


Yes but that's the nature of any trade - the point is not that the number of RMB is reduced, but rather that there is selling pressure; when for example the BTC/USD price is going up, people say "there are more buyers than sellers", which is wrong, there is one sell for every buy and vice versa, the point is that there is a change in perception/sentiment about the relative value of the two assets. Concern about capital flight is a similar deal but with another facet: not only concern about loss of perception of value (so drop in exchange rate), but also that any individual can violate any rules, clear or nebulous, the government has about what that individual is allowed to do. Simple example is the $50K USD limit per Chinese citizen per year on how much they can convert to foreign currency.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:08:04
Yes. It is very much case by case.
As it says in the [readme]( it's the responsibility of the user of the TLSNotary system to run self-test in advance and to check that two things are satisfied: (1) that the information needed for proof is clearly shown and (2) that you are OK with exposing all the information on that page.
There are for sure going to be banks/websites where TLSNotary won't work or will be impractical. Examples: dynamic html, not exposing account number of recipient (the latter will be rare I expect). The point is, you have to test it first.

Well, to be fair, *everybody* screamed for it after Gox (which time? :) ). But did you do anything about it? Some of us certainly did, I spent a big chunk of my life since then working on this :  (well, it certainly wasn't just me, and it wasn't originally called that, but you get the picture). It's not a decentralised exchange but it's potentially a hugely important component.
There are probably 20 or 30 attempts to create a decentralised exchange, and probably 4 or 5 that address the really hard problem of decentralised exchange of *fiat* for btc. 
Maybe most people are too lazy, as you say. My sense is that the vast majority of people who use centralised exchanges just want to keep using them and want them to stop failing. Unfortunately this is close to Einstein's definition of madness :) .

The "players" are supposed to be the users. Not approximately 2 guys who own most of the mining equipment.
The design of the system is *not* that the miners set the rules. If it was, they would just reset the block reward to 100 BTC whenever they felt like it. The design is that the miners decide on the time-ordering of transactions, and that's the *only* thing they decide. Not the protocol rules!

This is missing the point. *Anyone* can use native segwit as soon as it is activated (you don't need a specific address format to push a tx to the network, just a scriptPubKey); it's just that *wallets*, especially consumer ones, definitely won't, firstly because of the lack of an address format, but also (the key point) because only with p2sh wrap do you get the really excellent property that *non-updated wallets don't need to change one single line of code* ! I have seen people in the Bitcoin media repeat this error - no, not all wallets and software need to upgrade! Some do - for example, block explorers - if they want their information to be presented properly.
Also, another correction, this is not "the way Core has chosen to do it" - when segwit is activated, all the BIP141 options are available.
And, businesses can certainly use native segwit with its concomitant space savings immediately. Meanwhile, even with a small increase in a p2sh/p2w*h tx size, because of the weight calculation, the transaction throughput will increase.


Even given the correction above (they *don't* need to upgrade immediately), it's completely wrong to call it "technical debt". Was it "technical debt" when Bitcoin introduced p2sh addresses? If anything segwit *fixes* technical debt at the design level (dealing with malleability otherwise is a tremendous hassle); "technical debt" does not describe any situation in which code is added!

It already works, and you can test it on your own without an arbiter ("self-test mode"). It's actually been in a working form for several months. We'd appreciate it if you would do so, because we need a wider base of people to have tried it and report any bugs (although we've already done many thousands of tests within our dev group, that's never the same thing).
But it still awaits a broader system (whether a trading system or otherwise) to slot into. A few people have talked to us about that. Our earliest connection was with Manfred Karrer, who's the lead dev of bitsquare.

Bitcoin has a notarising value that nothing else has. A hash published to the blockchain is irreversibly timestamped in public, and it would take hundreds of millions of dollars to try to overwrite that publication, and it probably still wouldn't work because it would be near impossible to do it secretly. There is no one you can bribe to make that happen. 
Other forms of notarisation in the world are less reliable and more expensive.
E.g. you want a copyright system, you establish "prior art" in this way and then if it comes to a court case, the evidence produced this way is orders of magnitude better than anything else. You still need the court; but you don't need to spend on a human notarising agency. You can come up with similar ideas about land or property title, etc.
Having said that, gold's entirely-non-monetary uses are far more obvious and than Bitcoin's. On the other hand, Bitcoin, once widely enough used, is a far better form of money than gold.
This "inherent difference" that everyone seems to be so sure about is not so clear, in my opinion. Bitcoin does have non-monetary value.

There are two broad problems with the concept of proof of stake - technical and philosophical. The technical one centres on the 'nothing at stake' concept and has been discussed to death. But people seem to forget the philosophical problem with a system where owners of the cash token are automatically rewarded with more money. Over time (often right from the start!) this creates a completely unjust scenario, a kind of *rentier class* on steroids. 
When this is brought up people say 'oh mining centralisation problem' but that's just wrong - mining centralisation occurs in gold mining too, but it's still *fair* - yes big companies tend to get most of the profit (although they take a big risk too don't forget!), but the point is it's a *market* and anyone with enough skill can challenge the big players. It's normal - the barrier to entry is accumulating capital and having technical and business skills. What else should it be? It's the same for all industries. 
This cannot be compared with a system which algorithmically awards coins to a middleman who cannot be challenged in fair competition, and whose only requirement is that he leaves his computer switched on, and whose disproportionate reward only gets bigger as time goes by.

Obviously not. You can send it to other people. That is the entire point.
The blockchain allows for cash transfer.
It is true that creating other elements of a financial system involves creating (or reusing existing) trust systems. But the devil is in the details; there are several ways in which cryptocurrency (and cryptography in general) can enable more trustlessness (or less security holes a la Szabo "trusted third parties = security holes"). Examples: multisig means the escrow agent does not have to be trusted to *not run away with the money independently of the two counterparties*. Proof of reserve means knowing that a bank holds X btc without revealing any other private information. Etc.


Absolutely right. Just as scammers absolutely love cash. Bitcoin, being a more powerful form of cash (instant global transfer) is in some cases even more desirable, although its liquidity being as limited as it is, you'll find many scammers who prefer things like moneypaks.

From what I've seen of the crypto (admittedly not much, and it was a while ago), it looks extremely experimental (for context, the crypto in Bitcoin is all very well established stuff - ECDSA and SHA256).

It's a hybrid, realistically, while in this early stage where only a small number of people use it. If it became very widely used its volatility would reduce dramatically, and its potential as an investment would go down dramatically too.
And by the way, people *do* invest into currencies, both for speculation on exchange rate and for receiving the difference in interest rates (see: "carry trade").
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:06:33
OK, since you ask I will think of one or two other points. The major one is not about transaction facility, it is about the nature of money itself. I currently hold money in two forms - in bank accounts and in bitcoins. I actually feel more secure about the latter, in a way, because even though its purchasing power is proving hugely volatile, it is entirely under my control (because I know how to secure it). The money I have in banks is subject to the whim of the government issuing the currency, *and* subject to the whim of the bank who may at any time decide they don't like the cut of my jib and freeze the account.
Other transactional points - I can spend this anywhere; I can buy something from someone on the other side of the world immediately, if it is a digital good. Even if it isn't, it's often more convenient. Example - I buy hosting from another country - the payment using bitpay is seamless and does not involve typing in passwords, birth dates and so on as is required when I make an international credit card payment.
More - if I buy a drink in a coffee shop with Bitcoin, I don't have to worry about denominations or how much cash to carry with me, which is itself a security risk (I won't belabour that point, though, since carrying a small amount of BTC on a phone is also a small risk, although technology over time will reduce that). If I receive BTC in an in person transaction, I don't have to worry about counterfeit notes.
If you want to argue that BTC use amongst first worlders who stay within their own borders for day to day transactions is not compelling, I'm actually more or less with you, at least in the current situation (may be different in a year or two). But there are also significant advantages for small retail merchants operating on thin margins - removing the 3% or so credit card fees.

Yes, localbitcoins is a good starting point for understanding what we're aiming at, and as of today one of the better ways to exchange btc and fiat, at least for smallish amounts. 
It has the critical peer to peer payment aspect. Then we consider that there are some disadvantages. The Btc part isn't decentralised really because you have to use the localbitcoins wallet temporarily. The escrow and arbitration in case of dispute is completely centralised.
The fact that localbitcoins stores *any* bitcoins (including its fees of course) makes it a target. The fact that it controls the outcomes of disputes is not ideal; what if the company is very good at executing the exchange, but terrible at resolving disputes? You have no choice, there is no market.
Look at bitsquare.io as an example of a more fully decentralised version. There is also OpenBazaar which is not designed specifically for this kind of trade, but it's a similar design with a different emphasis. There is also coinffeine, which is an interesting idea but approaching it from a different angle; I fear it is not really as decentralised as we want (look at the fiat payment mechanism).
Addressing more directly your query about "interface with legacy banking system", is the project I worked on: TLSNotary ; not a trading system but a way of resolving disputes with cryptography.

Definitely yes, after the *first* hard fork which is not under overwhelming economic consensus, future holders have to factor in the risk of it happening again; specifically that key properties of the system can be changed by a vote. Nobody can know, but I believe that bitcoin's worth would be drastically reduced by that. I appreciate that free market economics dictates that the risk of such an effect is factored in, but since it's a new type of event, the market may not be pricing it accurately.

Well, if by 'all' you mean everyone on this subreddit, then no, that's not possible. 148,000 x 1000 is about 7 times all the Bitcoins that will ever be mined, and more than 10 times the Bitcoins in existence right now (even ignoring that many are lost).

No, it hasn't.


In this case, the economic majority decides, not the hashing power. If all exchanges and big merchants and users decide on BTC1 then it won't matter if the miners mine BTC2, they lose all their money. The very important caveat is that miners on BTC2 can attack the BTC1 chain - there are ways to deal with that, it's an interesting discussion, but doesn't alter the main point.

I'm not disagreeing, but let's be clear - if code is written properly, exposing the pubkey should *not* cause any danger of cracking. That is whole point of having a public key in an asymmetric encryption system, after all.
But, again, I'm not disagreeing. If you want the highest level security (and especially privacy), don't reuse addresses.

Yes and no. I was thinking only about proof of stake in its simplest form. But yes, you're right, I didn't consider the extra elements involved in DPOS, mainly because I haven't studied them.


I actually really don't understand any of that. First, I do believe it matters a *lot* if it's fair. But to the last sentence - I don't get it. Bitcoin's real supply is 21 million, that hasn't changed and won't. By releasing it according to a fixed schedule instead of all at once, Bitcoin is much fairer than it would be if everything was mined/created at the start. In the limit, you would have Satoshi owning all 21 million in Jan 2009. Do you think we would even be here having this discussion in that case?

Although it seems unlikely that a big organization would use such a mechanism, at least today, it would be really cool if *customers* could audit the fiat balance of the exchange this way (the exchange customer would act as auditor and get proof of what's on the balance statement). 
Of course, if the bank provided digitally signed balances, this would achieve the same effect. It's kind of criminal that banks don't use this simple and well established technology of digital signatures, except in rare cases.
And yes, whatever tech used to achieve it, public verification of a business' balance is not a 'normal' idea, because obviously that's kind of privileged information. But you can still have certain privileged auditors taking the role on behalf of the community of customers.

I may just be stating the obvious, but the critical feature of the kickstarter and similar systems is the fact that you don't spend anything unless a goal is reached. One can debate all day whether that leads to good outcomes, but it's clearly an interesting model.
In Lighthouse this is done cryptographically (via SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY to get technical), which allows the basic function to be achieved without a central third party. Here's where the concept was first described I believe:

I think they would not find it difficult to argue that a centralized join service is a "money transmitter", right, and so not doing the AML stuff would probably get you in .. some trouble.
The critical point (I'm sure you understand, but just fleshing it out for readers) is that a centralized "tumbler" is taking possession of the coins. In decentralized coinjoin, each participant is simply transferring his or her own money to another address (it just happens to be in the same transaction as other people). So there is no "money transmitter" except the network. Point guns at math etc etc. I don't mean to imply that there might not be a legal implication of taking part for *each participant* - there might be if it's determined that the intent is to hide the proceeds of ill gotten gains. IANAL.

This is a healthy instinct. I also don't trust hard drives. That's why I use Electrum with 12 word seeds. I know I can keep 12 words safe, through various mechanisms.
Of course you can also use redundancy in hardware.
Of course you also need 'intermediate' or 'hot' wallets for actual spending. There's various ways to do that, none of which are perfect but they're fine for small amounts. For example, use one of the many mobile phone wallets.
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:56:43




Completely wrong. Bitcoin solves the double spend problem, which is actually a deeper problem than just money/spending despite the name. As for efficiency, it's quite the opposite - the main reason nobody thought of Satoshi's approach was it because it seems so ludicrously inefficient to have every participant store the whole ledger. And that's still important because people keep saying "let's use a blockchain for X", when the extreme expense of a blockchain (or at least, a secure one) makes it a terrible design choice.
The community is not a den of thieves, because there is no "Bitcoin community", despite what all the talking heads say. That's the whole point of a decentralised system - it doesn't depend on any specific set of people, so you can call a certain set of people "the community" if you like, that's your choice, but it has no objective meaning.

Speaking as someone who's used online chess sites for about 15 years, I can tell you that you're kidding yourself if you think you can provide a meaningful monetary incentive, and prevent cheating.
In the case of ICC,  which was pretty much the only game in town during the 00s, they can detect cheating alright - after the event. It takes careful analysis, in particular looking at a number of games ideally; a crude cheater will just throw stockfish or whatever at a blitz/bullet game and play optimal moves, that's obvious, but you can be much cleverer than that.
And to get down to the basic point: there is no *objective* way of establishing cheating v non-cheating anyway, so it's basically unethical to withhold money from someone because you *think* they cheated.

I *tend* to agree, but without a strong conviction. I remember a little over a year ago, when bitcointips started appearing in this sub, how mindblowing it was to see it. We are in uncharted social territory here.
I personally like the idea of handing out 'bits' to people as a way of giving them a starting amount to play with. Another thing is tipping content providers; they'd probably much rather get a direct 'real' bitcoin tip, but using the bot on reddit is so convenient that I'd like to promote donations that way too (obviously you have to remember to treat it as an ultra-insecure wallet and don't store too much on it).

Well this is all third hand, but this is making them sound like petulant, small minded fools.
They don't seem to get it, in Bitcoin miners have no *status*, just as users have no status, that's the whole point. They're supposed to be anonymous. I think it was a huge mistake to invite them specifically as miners to meetings discussing protocol developments. Does anyone remember exactly how many times people have used the picture of "10 chinese miners" to dismiss Bitcoin as a ridiculous failure of decentralization? Now it's kind of true whether there's a picture or not, but the real point of that picture is that it shows that there is an explicit political process. And it wasn't just that one (Hong Kong) meeting. We need to stop feeding their perception that Bitcoin is something political.

I can't see where you're going with that. They seem like opposite ideas to me. If an asset is perfectly fungible it means that I don't have to trust, doesn't it?


But that's what I mean about muddying the waters. One aspect of the design leads to traceability - the public blockchain. Another aspect of the design - the many to many linkage of inputs and outputs - tends to create the opposite effect (see coinjoin). Also notice the difference with systems like digicash - where each coin is an actual 'thing', a number. Digicash got around that by using blinding. Bitcoin doesn't even have to get around it, because coins are not objects. The real 'objects' in Bitcoin are the utxos (these are what Satoshi is referring to as 'coins' in the whitepaper, confusingly enough!). But utxos are destroyed (or rendered dormant, let's say) in every transaction and new utxos are created in their place. Like I say, it's muddy.
So digicash has perfect privacy and therefore fungibility but achieves at the cost of a central point - the mint/bank (it not only creates the tokens, but is the clearing point through which transactions pass, I believe). Bitcoin gives up perfect privacy but makes it possible to achieve some privacy through a combination of many-many transactions (plus extra steps like creating new receiving addresses every time, as Satoshi recommended). Then there's zerocash which maybe takes it a step further - using zero knowledge proofs to allow untraceability without a central mint (but I believe it needs a trust point at the start of the chain - sorry I don't know the details).

The fact that Bitcoin requires all users to store and process all the activity of *all other users*. There's a good reason nobody had previously thought of designing a system like this - it sounds totally insane!
If you want a concrete sense of it, I've been running a node for years. It's currently taking 1MB of my hard disk every 10 minutes, taking some bandwidth and CPU etc. Imagine if we scaled to Visa network levels and didn't change the architecture - it would max out my resources. I couldn't do it as just an ordinary user. 
Now, the solutions to this problem are what people argue about. But that's basically it.

Hard forks require *all* users to agree, which is incredibly hard because users aren't identified in any way in the system. Soft forks only require miners to agree.
2MB + segwit creates a scenario where 8MB could be mined (don't forget it could happen maliciously); that has potential to be quite unsafe.
Segwit itself could already be giving us 2MB blocks if miners hadn't decided to block it politically.

In the base case scenario of usage, we're thinking of auditing a transfer record: recipient account number, amount and currency (and date) being the critical info. Not so much balance.
Regarding timing and reversibility: sure. The people involved in the transaction would have to have some agreement about what counts as a 'finalised' transaction before releasing the other side of the tx (the Bitcoin side, let's say, typically we imagine a 2 of 3 multisig).

I don't understand this part. In one what particular sense do they mean 'fiat currency' in this sentence? You can create an asset, tie it to a coloured coin, and then issue it on the blockchain, fine. But there seem to be only two options: you then totally abandon any control of that asset, meaning indeed there is no liability - but in what sense is that 'fiat'? Or, you keep some kind of control (example: a coloured coin asset redeemable for gold, or you keep the ability to print more of the asset at any time), in which case, there is liability, right?

For every buyer there's a seller. There aren't literally more bitcoins as a result of a particular price path.

I like the video, but the reddit title isn't great.
The difference between owning bank deposits and owning (gold or cash) is that the former is really more an IOU, whereas in the latter case there is genuine ownership, if you hold physical metal or paper notes. There is no *counterparty risk* owning gold, although admittedly that's a big oversimplification.
In that classification Bitcoin is on the same side as cash and gold, in opposition to bank deposits. You own a private key, which gives exclusive and total control over whatever set of unspent transaction outputs can be unlocked with that key.
The video is more trying to allow people to understand the relationship between private keys, unspent transaction outputs and 'bitcoins'. 
An amusing detail for those who don't know: the first 50 bitcoins from the genesis block are unspendable by a quirk of design.

I think that gatekeeper role (prevention of evil updates) *has* to be in the development process, not the miner signalling process - because miners can take adversarial actions at a whim, whereas code has to be readable before being run.

Well, Bitcoin itself (the protocol) doesn't use encryption.
The crypto primitives that the protocol actually uses are ECDSA digital signatures, SHA-2 and RIPEMD-160 (did I miss one?). The first of the three is a bit brittle (nonce reuse is catastrophic, side channel attacks (see recent news on that) etc), and got wide usage because of the patent on Schnorr, so they say. libsecp256k1 tried to make it a lot more robust and performant, because Bitcoin is so critically dependent on it. And it's in massively wide usage amongst a lot of systems. SHA-2 seems to be nowhere near any kind of break from what I've read (also incredibly widely used in industry). RIPEMD is a bit more of a backwater, but I *think* a break of it would not be so critical as the others (? never thought about it, say second preimage, could you use that for an attack?)

I tried to make an argument in this thread: 
I keep pimping it out even though it probably wasn't fully fleshed out thinking; the reason is, I've been perplexed for years that no one wants to make the argument that PoW isn't just "not inferior" but possibly the *only* way to achieve the goal. I admit it's not a trivial claim! But some aspects of the argument do seem to be quite obvious and almost never mentioned.

I'm not making an assertion that PoW magically removes the possibility of rewriting history, rather that it creates an objective record; in the case of a fundamental flaw/bug, history can be deliberately ignored, but nobody is under any illusion what that history *is*. I don't believe you can create that objectivity through PoS systems; multiple histories are possible, and not because of an inferiority in an algorithm (so that a superior, cleverly designed algo can solve it), but rather because there is no "latch" onto something that can't be faked.

Except calling this "blockchain" is faintly ridiculous. Banks have discovered, about 20 years after the fact, that cryptographic hashes and digital signatures are useful. They have no need for a complex and inefficient consensus mechanism for time ordering between untrusted parties (what a blockchain actually does), because they are not using untrusted parties. They call it "blockchain" because it sounds cool to them, and they couldn't care less about the accuracy of it (not that the empty suits parrotting these phrases know the difference).

Don't quote me, the paper's out there) - I seem to remember thinking they were overestimating (i.e. : false positives included).

No, that statement is misleading. Of course you can link the change outputs to the inputs, in the most usual implementation of CoinJoin. "It's trivial to deanonymize transactions" - I say misleading because, *what* exactly is "deanonymized" here? The linkage between the input and a particular change output. But that is not what the transaction is trying to achieve. The transaction is trying to prevent linkage between the coinjoin output and the input. Of course, it does so in an extremely limited way for a 2 party join, but you can do N-party joins and you can do multiple chained 2-party joins also.
The entirely *separate* issue of whether you then merge the linked change outputs with the unlinked coinjoin outputs, can be addressed by wallet design.
The article reads, in tone, to the uninitiated, like the discovery of some amazing attack/flaw when it's simply describing in an elementary way what the issues are around CoinJoin.

One of the most concrete thing the BTC Foundation did was start paying Gavin a salary and then later, a couple of other devs too. They did that using foundation member fees.

Something like that.

Just for another perspective: 
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:18:46






It is highly misleading to describe digital signatures as encryption, because the message is not hidden. The fact that the mathematical operation is basically the same (with public and private key roles reversed) doesn't alter this.
A digital signature consists of *the message in cleartext* followed by a piece of data that *anyone* can verify using the public key. This openness is a critical part of the design (sorry I know I'm stating the obvious but I'm kind of forced to here :) ).
It's a very significant distinction to make in a case like Bitcoin; people find public key crypto (or any kind of crypto) confusing enough, but if you tell them that Bitcoin uses encryption in its protocol, they will naturally think that transaction data is hidden, when of course it isn't.
Of course we (usually) do use encryption to hide private keys locally, which can create more confusion. Let's not make it worse.

True, you can make that distinction. It is possible to broadcast bitcoin transactions via radio though (although it still means *someone* has to have internet somewhere).

Yes. Note that, in the case of an N-party coinjoin, N&gt;=2, there is *no* cryptographic protocol that can protect you from the scenario that the other N-1 parties are colluding/passing information and therefore know your outputs.
On the other hand, randomization algorithms might help if you're in a counterparty-rich environment (which is realistic in the joinmarket scenario). I know 's already been thinking about that a bit.

Yes it looks easy *now* because you know there's been a steady downtrend for a year. Always easy with hindsight. Trying this strategy doesn't work so well selling all the way down from about $150 to $50 in April 2013, after which you would be completely out and miss everything from $50 to $1000. Every statement of "you should obviously follow this buy/sell strategy" is predicated on the assumption that you can predict some aspect of the future evolution of price.

It shouldn't, but that's something you can check, no?

"if POS is possible", "if POS is superior"...
Really? Of course it's possible! But if POS really is superior, why is something like Bitcoin of any interest at all? Simply establishing consensus via a quorum is nothing novel, there were systems to do that 20 years ago.

It's a valid comparison, but there one big difference: holdings in gold are either (a) very "visible"/public and therefore open to confiscation attacks (see: egold) or (b) hidden and therefore not validatable. With something like bitcoin, validation of reserves is possible without exposure to other attacks (see the work on pedersen commitments in merkle trees as a way to get that kind of audit with privacy). And there are ways to make violent confiscation less feasible, too, that can be mixed in.
I remember having a lot of discussions about this kind of scenario a couple of years back; it's an interesting one ("audit the Coinbase!") but slightly less significant given the ability to create layers that are not requiring trust (Lightning), albeit we shouldn't put 100% weight on that.

Yes, as is so often the case in these attacks, it's a lot less dangerous than the obvious/panicky/clickbaity titles you might see.

It's cash because there is no counterparty. A bank deposit is the bank's liability - in other words, it's money you have lent to the bank. There is no guarantee that you will be able to access that money - see Cyprus bailout, or their decision that you are a money launderer. Cash is different (and physical gold also has this property) - it's an asset that you own with no external dependency.

It only makes sense to think of Bitcoin as "cheap" or "expensive" from an investment/speculation point of view (can I make profit out of holding it). Even then, it's debatable whether the price you buy in at is of any importance (yes, I know that sounds ridiculous, but give serious thought to the concept of the efficient market hypothesis).
From the point of view of usage, the current exchange value of 1 bitcoin is pretty much irrelevant. What *does* matter is the volatility, obviously less is better from that point of view. And that muddies the argument because in general, the volatility will increase if the price gets lower because that implies a lower liquidity (a $1 million buy/sell can affect price a lot when the market cap is $100 million, but not at all when the market cap is $100 billion).
What definitely *doesn't* make sense is to think "oh, i can't afford Bitcoin if it's $1000".
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:50:47


No, it's not sad, it is of course inevitable. You don't get it. The point is not whether a market is regulated or not, the point is whether there's a market in regulation.
If you want to see what happens when there is no market in regulation, see what happens to bankers after a crash that they caused. I'll give you a clue: they get bailed out by the regulating agency (the government), given billions and keep their jobs, while pushing the abject failure of their investment strategy onto the rest of the population.
People who buy things with an irreversible form of payment, without any guarantees or without doing any due diligence, and without considering the risk, are usually doing so because they are both greedy and lazy. I'm sorry that many such people lose their money, but I'm not surprised and nor should anyone else be. Take responsibility.

They calculate the output of a complex function, true; but it's not solving an equation. Probably that just seems like an irrelevant quibble, but the real problem is that describing it as solving an equation or a puzzle is misleading because it suggests that success is a matter of being clever. If that were the case, the system wouldn't work. It's vitally important that it functions as a random lottery.

I've been running a node all the last week, no noticeable effect on my internet at all, including video etc.
People seem to vastly overestimate the effect. Bitcoin Core hits your machine *hard* on startup, depending on where you are with the blockchain, mostly via big CPU hit (signature verification) but also bandwidth. Afterwards, in steady state, it's just blips of bandwith usage here and there, mostly not that much. I limit to 20 connections, maybe that helps to keep it down, don't know.

It's not as if that's the only choice.
If you want to simply assert existence ("prior art"), you can do it yourself with some limited programming knowledge, or use a simple service like proofofexistence. 
Ascribe is trying to do something more - index the internet and try to assert ownership of digital assets (hmm, perhaps I should assert my "ownership" of the equilateral triangle). I find the concept unpleasant.
Factom is doing more than just stamping a doc hash in the blockchain. Although I did read their paper I've forgotten all the details but clearly they're trying to provide an extra layer of functionality. 
So, not a defence of Factom, but I think you need to carefully evaluate ascribe, and if you just want a doc timestamp, you don't really need either.

yes you're interpreting that right, except 250 bytes is not an 'average' transaction; you could say it's a typical size for a 'basic' transaction (one in, one out, one change); but the mean value is higher on the blockchain because there are a fair number of transactions that are *much* larger.
@_date: 2017-02-22 11:15:24


Segwit does allow bigger blocks. Realistically up to ~ 2MB with current transaction mix, theoretically up to 3.5-4MB with specific transaction types (but that's not going to happen absent *perhaps* an attack).
@_date: 2017-02-25 13:13:31
What makes this all so difficult is that there are even *three* separate issues at hand:
* Segwit or not
* Max block size increase (separate from segwit's weight) or not
* Hard fork or not
The first is afaict no-brainer to *everyone* with technical knowledge; even Andresen and Garzik agree. But that doesn't mean you can completely extricate the three, because (a) segwit + block_size increase is compounding (SW+2MB is max 8MB as of now, not 2MB), and block size is always a HF by definition.
The "compromise" 2MB HF + SW is hugely appealing politically, but it seems like a really bad non-solution in a practical technical sense (both because HF is bad, and because 8MB max is so large that there would be a lot of (sensible) opposition to such a thing).
And all of this is not even factoring in the motivations of the miners, and the fact that hashpower is sufficiently concentrated that those motivations really matter (are they against fungibility which segwit helps? are they thinking too short term (maximize fees now at expense of Bitcoin long term)? are they motivated only by political disagreement with devs? do they have enough technical understanding to evaluate segwit? etc.)

I think he *mostly* understood it all from the beginning (where 'the beginning' is when he first appeared on the Bitcoin scene in 2013).

But really, that's a criticism of other people; Gendal always pretty much got it (although I remember calling him out on literally the first thing he said publically here:  ; but hey, he still does a damn good job of explaining this stuff compared to most people). Also, he is a big proponent of other systems like Ethereum, which doesn't make him "the enemy" (I think an adversarial attitude to Ethereum is kind of ridiculous) - that's just a very different project with different goals (and it's also hugely ambitious and so far untested).

@_date: 2015-05-01 19:53:22
I've (and we've) thought a lot about it. See this blog post: 
Technically, ~~non-~~repudiability is not removed, unless you consider that the PageSigner server, configured as an Amazon AWS oracle is perfectly trustless. Actually, it requires trust in Amazon. On the other hand, if a genuinely perfectly trustless oracle is possible (and it should be theoretically), then you have created non-repudiability fully.
(A bit more clarification on that point: first, you can run TLSNotary purely, without a server; that doesn't give non-repudiability, since it only shares the proof of the page with one counterparty. This is probably a better solution for many scenarios, but more hassle for users. Second, there is no actual dependence on an "oracle" configuration for a server, you can use an ordinary server. The great thing is that, whatever server you use, there is no need to pass actual encrypted or unencrypted content to the server, so if it gets hacked, the worst thing the hacker can do is prevent the notarization from completing).
Think of it this way: if someone tells you a secret, is it morally acceptable to pass it on? If they specifically agree with you that it should not be passed on, then perhaps not. At the other end of the spectrum, consider the scenario of a person asked to provide invasive private information to a third party to win trust; isn't it better that they can reduce the scope of that information by getting better proof? Why don't governments, banks etc append digital signatures to the statements they give to their citizens or customers? (such things are happening; but I'd argue there is a reason, especially in the case of corporations, why they are reluctant to do so) (edit: dug up the old discussion we had about this: 
A deeper philosophical question is whether there is a place for leveraging the trust in institutions without their permission.
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:13:33
Yes, but sidechains are called *side*chains for a good reason: Bitcoin is not point-point, it's broadcast. Adding more and more semantic layers in a stack to support more and more message types would require too much bandwidth in the long run. 
And of course, anything which offloads transactions from the main chain, like Lightning, can also achieve that goal to a greater or lesser extent - letting Bitcoin scale and keeping some or other degree of trustlessness without overloading the main chain.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:05:12
Yes, this is one of many reasons it has to be considered a last resort. Although I don't think it'd be a threat in the 51/49 case. If 51 hard forked and the 49 stayed on the old chain, it wouldn't be possible for a subset of the 51 to overcome the 49 - you can't use hashpower in two places. In a more likely scenario like 75/25 they could do that, although it's complete chaos, and in that scenario at least the number of 'honest, screwed over' miners is smaller.
The ETH/ETC case might be instructive. There was quite a bit of talk of attacking the minority chain (it was a 90/10 split so def. possible), but it didn't happen; most of the miners were too busy figuring out which chain was more profitable to mine on. If there's no attack I don't think there will be a PoW switch (it's about having it available much more than using it).

BU developers throw insults in the code and in their commit messages. From what I've heard, they [don't even allow participation and discussions in the open]( as Bitcoin, the open source project, always has.
BU is still of course 99% just code taken from the bitcoin/bitcoin repo, and the remaining 1% has at least enough bugs to already have caused a fork on the network.
But to be honest I don't care much about that stuff, because it could be changed, what I care about is that their idea of "emergent consensus" is an utterly stupid idea that is likely to kill Bitcoin entirely.

A little context for those who don't want to read the details (but, of course, do read them).
Just doing a 5-party coinjoin is not significant if done "manually"; the idea here is that there are a bunch of bots sitting around on &lt;insert messaging protocol&gt;,  waiting to help anyone do a coinjoin of their funds. So you come along with funds in your wallet and type 
    python sendpayment.py -N 4  (2 coins) (send-to address) &lt;stuff&gt;
(or eventually, your wallet software will do that for you)
and it automatically finds 4 counterparties to do the join with. Now, since they have to wait around, while you're demanding a join right now, they get paid fees (a small amount of course; but set by the market).
The idea is a win-win of liquidity for those who want privacy and those who want to earn a (modest) income. Without an incentive it's impossible to get enough people interested in doing joins.

Dumb people were pushing this point constantly up to 2013, because of wishful thinking. Some of us were trying to point out it can't be like that, but people hear what they want to hear.
Another one is "makes banks obsolete", that is *almost* as dumb. Bitcoin is cash (or more technically a bearer instrument) not a bank account. If Bitcoin makes anything obsolete it's *central* banks and physical cash (in both cases, a rather optimistic assertion!), but certainly not retail banks or financial services - at best it radically changes their function, but it in no way replaces them.

In Amir's case; well I definitely can't speak for him, but it's stuff to do with communes and "building tools for the people". What I can never get on board with is this idea that localized communities solve the problem of society, that's exactly the Dunbar number problem - you can make a great voluntary society in a small group, but it doesn't scale. And without scale we lose all the technological advancements of the last ~ 300 years.

Hard forks without overwhelming consensus are dangerous and impractical.
Nobody can really say for sure what is a sensible max block size limit; luke-jr is in a tiny minority (your 300kB quote), but there seems to be broad agreement that &gt; 4MB is not safe, and some think it should be lower.
I'd like to see say ~ 2MB block limit today (or gradual increase of the limit to that level) so that we get a bit more breathing room on fees while better off-chain scaling solutions (Lightning) have a chance. But, big caveat, I think there's some wishful thinking going on here, can-kicking is not the solution, and Lightning is not a guaranteed panacea. If we bump to 2MB or 4MB now and then just celebrate because it's cheap, we'll be back to square one but with far worse centralization and attack vectors, soon enough.

CT requires a lot of space as currently implemented (a few kB for a typical output, although it depends on amount resolution for example). Not to mention the other issues with folding it into Bitcoin. No simple matter; I'd really love to see a main net sidechain with it, that seems like a sensible trade-off.
Meanwhile don't reuse addresses, and coinjoin ruins a lot of blockchain analysis (was just looking at an example on wallet-explorer yesterday from joinmarket transactions). And the thing I always mention which no one seems to pay attention to: there is an *inherent* fungibility in bitcoin because satoshis don't exist, don't have a serial number etc - this is a consequence of having a many-many mapping transaction design. (By which i don't mean to say "bitcoin is fungible", that's just wrong, more an assertion "bitcoin can have fungibility" as a counterpoint to the oft-quoted "all bitcoin is completely traceable with enough effort, down to the last satoshi" - which is flat out 100% wrong).

There seems to be some disagreement on that point amongst the expert, depending on precise definitions of "hard fork". Some say that there have never been hard forks.

The 25 x 6 x 24 btc every day are a *known in advance* inflation. If I buy today at $x, I do so in full knowledge that millions more btc are going to be inflated onto the market over the next several years. This is a critical point. Since it's known, it's not really different from producing it all upfront.
The real difference is that it enables a broader group of people to mine the currency over time, instead of the premine scenario, which is what you're advocating (? are you?) where all the coins are produced at the start and given to whoever starts the project. Example: Ripple labs.

It is certainly not a deception to call it a scaling improvement.
First because it does improve scalability, and does offer paths to more improvements in scalability (example: schnorr signature aggregation), and it also provides a very substantial increase in maximum block size in a way that is much safer than a consensus-breaking hard fork.

There are so many things wrong with whoever the authors of this opinion are saying; makes an absolutely critical and good point about HFs, but also for example:


A currency is *not* owned by businesses, and if is, guaranteed it will fail long term. This is the mistake they've made from the start (talking generally about a lot of SV VC funded companies I guess); they think the Bitcoin blockchain exists to serve their use cases and that somehow they can influence it. If transactions are "too expensive" for them right now, then that means their business model is unfortunately **entirely broken**; a global distributed ledger, in any kind of long-term successful equilibrium, will just not cost a few cents to transact on! How could they not have noticed this? It was obvious to *everyone* with half a clue as soon as they looked at Bitcoin's design.
The right solution was always going to be some kind of layering, exactly how to make that work and be attractive *is* the kind of problem businesses would want to solve, not throw a monkey wrench into the base layer to serve their short sighted needs.


This is an excellent example of just how low a level of understanding these people have. I hate to suggest it, but maybe they should dirty their hands and read sources like r/Bitcoin . One answer I remember giving recently is [here]( but I'm sure there are tons of others.


True, but it's a shame that the opinions expressed here are also woefully unprofessional and un-scientific, because you haven't bothered to educate yourself on the basics.


Segwit has been active on 4 different testnets over more than a year. What updates are being waited for? To the casual reader this suggests that "Bitcoin software" is not ready, but Bitcoin Core (the one that actually runs the nodes) is, and so are quite a few wallets and so on. If a few businesses haven't yet bothered to update, that's their problem, it's nothing to do with Bitcoin. They've had more than a year to get on it (I remember feeling embarrassed that I started to look at it in Apr 2016, "late") ...


What kind of nonsense is this? You think *nobody apart from core devs* has tested segwit? Just how out of touch are you?!


OK I've had enough. This is idiotic. Tell me again why *anyone* should care about the opinions of .. whoever this is?

There are three aspects I'd bring up in response:
First, raw Bitcoin is not *primarily* an everyday consumer technology. The way I often put it is Bitcoin replaces SWIFT not Starbucks points. That doesn't mean it isn't a consumer payments technology at all; indeed I use it regularly for online payments without any trouble, and much prefer it to using insecure credit cards (e.g. I paid for a trip (flight, hotel) with it last week). But in its raw form it's problematic for the everyday person, mainly because of security issues.
Second, a lot of the criticisms (e.g. Western Union is better) are purely a function of the current situation, and represent a lack of dynamic perspective. Bitcoin was utterly useless for anything in 2009. Last week I booked a flight with it. Western Union is *certainly* not better in a world where Bitcoin is spendable in everyday life; e.g. a Chinese friend of mine paid a debt to me in Bitcoin earlier last year. That was certainly a hell of a lot easier than using Western Union; we just have to assume that for me, it is as good as money, otherwise I will have to exchange it again, incurring fees anyway. The same can be said about arguments with respect to volatility; its volatility is largely driven by it being such a small, illiquid market. If you trace the logic carefully, you should realise that what you're actually saying is: Bitcoin will never be a good money because it's not a good money today. If that's true, how come it became so much better as money over the last 5 years?
Third, it's easy to dismiss the other aspect as 'ideological', but I consider that what you're really talking about is a *lack* of ideology; a neutrality and non-censorability. Bitcoin cannot be printed at will, cannot be faked and cannot be censored. This is not really ideology, it's the fundamental properties of money.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:00:01
think of digital signature as a kind of reverse of encryption. in encryption, someone takes your pubkey and 'wraps' their message using it: then only you can unwrap/decrypt it with the private key.
In digital signatures, you take a hash digest of the message and 'wrap' it using your private key. Then anyone who has your pubkey can 'unwrap' it, see the hash and verify that it's the right hash of that message (because you broadcast the message in plaintext).
Bitcoin uses the second - digital signatures - to sign transactions, so all nodes on the network can verify the transactions are valid. The transactions are broadcast in plaintext. But none of the data passed between nodes or stored in the blockchain is using encryption - the first scenario described above.
(Excuse any gross oversimplifications..)

@_date: 2017-03-22 17:38:29
It's just not correct to say it's only a malleability fix. First there's payment channels/LN that work much better with the malleability fix (that's the big one, in potential), then there's Schnorr enabled via easier script upgrade, then there's linear scaling of sighashing, then there's utxo bloat reduction. If you (and correctly, btw) don't class blocksize increase as scalability but are only interested in genuine scalability improvements, then there's nothing even to argue: BU is insanely dumb and breaks the Bitcoin protocol in the process, while segwit opens up a viable path, mainly because LN and similar become reasonably possible.

Bitcoin is being advertised enough, more or less. The problem is, as you say, getting the technology into people's hands.

As he explained on the podcast (although the hosts didn't pursue it), the real win is going from *broadcast* to *point-to-point*. Although they later described it as a "force multiplier", that's not really accurate - it's not a simple multiple, like raw btc network supports 10tps =&gt; Lightning support k*10 tps. It takes out the O(N^2 ) scaling of broadcast; it won't increase the number of transactions achievable in such a simple way. One payment channel might allow Alice to pay Bob 1000 tiny transactions, and the load on the raw btc network might just be 2 or 3 txs, while the only people who need to deal with the bandwidth requirements of the 1000 would be Alice, Bob and 1 or 2 other counterparties.
There is no fixed block size required to make Lightning work; the bigger the block size, the more Lightning can support. The point is it will scale much better.

No, what you perceive as stubbornness is really the stubbornness of global consensus, not that of any individual; hard forks *have* to break consensus, that's the problem. It's a risk we don't have to take, and a coordination problem we don't have to solve, given segwit -&gt; ~2MB

It'll have very small fees paid to node operators based on supply and demand; since there is small switching cost and small costs to operate such a node, it stands to reason that fees will be small. We've seen something similar play out within joinmarket; people only charge &lt; 10000 satoshi fees to take part in coinjoins because it costs them so little to stand up a node. (Comparison isn't really valid but meh, it's a little real-world data point)
Figuring out exactly what will be reasonable fees is hard, but it will inevitably be orders of magnitude lower per tx than on-chain. If you do a bit of googling you'll probably find some places where experts have discussed this. Again, Lightning is a big and complex topic.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:39:55
Malleability of txid comes from txid hash including the signature(s). Hashing signatures is simply wrong, and is solved by hashing the transaction only, not the signatures of the transaction. This has caused a lot of headaches in the past (e.g. MtGox according to Karpeles, but other systems too involving chains of transactions), and prevents more complex smart contracting (as used in Lightning, but not only) from working properly.

And here's the kicker - it's in *bearer assets*, i.e. it's something very close to being able to take cash notes out of a computer. Nothing like how difficult is to gain value from stealing bank credentials, where inordinate efforts have to be made to avoid transaction reversal. So the level of scrutiny is really intense.

Look, it's simple. Bitcoin is digital *cash*. If these ponzi schemers could get money from 10,000 random people as easily using physical cash as they could with digital cash, they'd for sure use physical cash instead. 
What you are arguing for is exactly what a lot of talking heads at the "top" of society are currently arguing for: that cash should be banned. That all financial transactions should only happen with the express permission of authorities. This is tantamount to saying that, because some people are stupid (and because turrists and child porn, whatever), no individuals (except extremely wealthy and powerful ones) should actually be able to own money.

TLDR: some scammy coin dev put a backdoor into the code for his coin, Cryptsy ran it, scammer got direct control over their server.

Of course, this no proof of anything - certainly not proof of no inside job, for example.

The rest of it is a lot of thinking. Especially about the Byzantine generals solution via proof of work, which is a bit of a brain-bender.
Edit: actually, to save time, you don't need to know anything about elliptic curves; it's just the concept of a digital signature that you need to fully understand.

specialists with server farms of **specialized** hardware. A server farm would
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with
that one node.
He doesn't make any value judgements about it, so it's difficult to know if he was ever worried about it. As to the 51% attack, he made his case in the paper. It is not watertight of course; the 51% attack is *the* weakness of Bitcoin's design.

The two things are not at the same level of causation. Gold did not become enormously valuable popular because it was a currency *first*; what it was first, was a commodity with extremely rare properties.
The first use of Bitcoin, as you well know, was routing around Wikileaks payment censorship and Silk Road. If it didn't have a significant differentiating factor to start with, it would never have gained ... "currency". In parallel, people perceived the value in limited supply.
The heart of Bitcoin must remain as those properties, otherwise it will be worthless. Scaling solutions can be built on top of decentralized layers, but not the other way around. If the base layer is censorable, the whole thing fails.

The open source project which is Bitcoin (and often misleadingly labelled "Core" as if it were a private company) already has compromised/negotiated by giving the community an ~ 2MB block size limit - enabled within segwit. That can be activated at any time the miners choose to.
There is no let up though, in the attacks and lying against them. The other side of the debate is a set of people who want to take control of Bitcoin politically - "fire Core" as they put it. What they are trying to replace it with is an entirely political system, where miners dynamically vote on protocol rules in real time, and block sizes have no absolute limit. This is such a radical departure from Satoshi's design that it barely deserves the name Bitcoin, is bound to lead to even more extreme centralization and politicization, and most important, is almost certainly not safe.
So yes it's extremely toxic on their side, and extremely dangerous. On our side we're trying to defend Bitcoin from their attack, I don't think that can be described as toxic.

Just ignorance at that time. Paypal payments are highly reversible, so anyone selling bitcoin for a paypal payment is/was taking a tremendous, almost always unacceptable, risk (putting aside the fact that Paypal didn't, and I think still doesn't, support this particular kind of exchange, although it supports/allows Bitcoin in some other senses).
The answer to 'why is it so hard to buy Bitcoin' is entirely because the legacy system of payments regulation is designed to prevent it - cash payment over the internet, i.e. direct transfer with no third party and no tracking of ID.
It is not some accident of "poor business practices" or technical incompetence, or even for that matter, a conspiracy ... Bitcoin is specifically designed to achieve something that the existing financial system is explicitly designed to prevent wherever possible.

Yes, that's my understanding too (and intuitively obvious at a high level).


That's true but you'd need to be a bit more specific about what's being lost. A lot of casual observers have gained the entirely wrong impression that Lightning involves trust or centralization in ways that it really doesn't.


A common refrain, but you need to do some careful hard-headed analysis to explain why the apparent total lack of fungibility hasn't already left it dead in the water. Why have all exhange thiefs and exit scams not been caught?
I think there are a lot of subtleties here - compare deniability with anonymity, recognize the *intrinsic* fungibility that it *does* have (almost nobody recognizes this), and perhaps most importantly, consider that straddling the line between transparency and privacy has benefits as well as drawbacks. I think the quality of analysis on these issues has been atrocious over the years.


Meh, nothing is perfect. I doubt that whatever the "real" solution is *won't* have layering, just as money today has layers with different degrees of hardness and usability - and if it does have layering, it's not at all obvious that the base layer won't remain Bitcoin, with perhaps some upgrades (although as we can see they're damn hard to achieve!).
@_date: 2017-03-05 11:35:00


Yes and no and we don't know :) First it will raise the blocksize to 1.7-2.1MB, it'll take a little while for people to start making use of this raise, and *during that period and the succeeding (few months? year or two?)* the fees are highly likely to go a fair distance lower, but we can never be sure because it depends how much people want to use Bitcoin. If the usage doesn't dramatically increase (like 2x ) over those few months, then the fees could drop quite a lot.
In the medium term, once that extra space gets used up, then the fee situation may start again to get similarly bad as now, however, segwit enables new technologies which could change the situation for good. One such is Lightning (long topic), but there are potentially others like schnorr based signatures.

I'm going to parrot what I always say in this context. Just because 90% of mining power is in the hands of 10-20 people does *not* have anything like the same implications as having a currency under the control of central banks. The difference is openness. All transactions are broadcast in public, verified in public. Miners can censor, if they collude, but they would do so at enormous risk to their own business **because we would all see it immediately**. This is *nothing like* current payment systems, where you cannot route around the censorship, and have no option to fork. The threat of a radical fork hangs heavily over the heads of any set of miners who decide they want to censor Bitcoin transactions.
Even with relatively high mining concentration, it's still decentralized because there's no *enforcement* of that particular concentration - it can change at any time. Meanwhile there *is* enforcement of honest behaviour.
Of course I don't mean to imply that there is *no* issue with mining being in too few hands, but only that it's nothing like the same kind of problem as is considered by people who are not thinking carefully. And the fact that we allow competition and the best mining to rise to the top is exactly what's allowed Bitcoin to achieve such a ridiculously high level of security against *external* attack. If we were still on CPUs botnets would be an ever-present threat. Put simply, power matters. If you want magic fairy dust money with no weight there are lots of options :)
@_date: 2017-02-10 07:46:20
Note that already, for years, we have had off-blockchain payments in Bitcoin (e.g. on Coinbase, changetip, on exchanges etc).
When I first came to Bitcoin I assumed that scaling would happen that way, because it seemed entirely obvious that it couldn't scale and would not be cheap to transaction on chain (I always used to say "Bitcoin is SWIFT not Starbucks points").
Now that is obviously suboptimal because of the trust, but there are still benefits coming from cryptography even in that scenario (see e.g. Todd/Maxwell work on provable solvency/audits).
Lightning takes something really great and makes it amazing; you preserve basically *all* of the trustlessness of the base layer. Unproven? Sure, I totally agree, but even if it never happens, we have the right model: uncensorable base layer, relatively slow and heavy, with "fast"/retail built only on top of that.

Segwit is segwit + 2MB now. Segwit with an increase to 2MB in base block size means 8MB max block size, which serious research has indicated isn't safe today (&gt; 4MB).
Nothing can't be argued about, but a hardfork has to have overwhelming consensus to be safe (a hardfork is literally changing what Bitcoin is, everyone has to be on board).
There's no prospect of 1.6-2.1MB blocks "instantly being filled" as you put it, it'll require significant adoption of SW and it will take time, and also depends on actual meaningful growth in Bitcoin usage, but if it happens rapidly, then we just have to deal with it, it doesn't magically make 8MB blocks a good idea.
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:40:29


Not recognized enough. There are no ~~spoons~~ "bitcoins".
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:58:43


Not ignoring other factors, no.
The trivial example is: 80% of the hashrate hard forks to a chain where the block reward is increased from 12.5 BTC/block to 50BTC/block. The users would not follow, because this is unambiguously not Bitcoin.
The murky case is where there is a significant split among the users of the right choice to make. On the one hand, inertia strongly favours whatever the existing chain is; if you hardfork, you are requiring *everyone* to update their Bitcoin software to accommodate it. If a lot of people don't want to, they may not follow you. If the economic activity doesn't follow you, you are expending tremendous energy cost to mine a chain which is not actually valued.
Generally speaking, contentious hard forks are a disastrously bad idea; the more you think about it, the more you realise this. That's why getting an increase in block size and great future scalability potential with segwit was such a great win - because it used a *soft fork* which *doesn't* require everyone to upgrade all at once, and doesn't fork the chain into two versions, as with a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:23:28
No, it's not 'as originally meant to happen' at all. Miners decide order of transactions and inclusion, they don't control protocol rules. They never did.
BIP 9 signalling is not a vote on rules, it's indicating readiness for upgrade - a safety feature.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:12:26
Not the point. For example, gold is a bearer asset also; the fact that anyone, government or not, can confiscate it does not make it any less so. Does the fact that a criminal can steal my gold by force mean that is subject to some other rule? When a government agency confiscates gold from a criminal, they don't do so because its ownership is recorded as belonging to someone else. That can, of course, happen, but in many cases it's confiscation of assets because they belong to a criminal, not because they belong (by legal right) to someone else, because there doesn't *have* to be an ownership paper trail (although there can be). That's the point of a bearer instrument. And indeed, that's exactly what happened in the case of Ullbricht: the bitcoins were seized presumably as proceeds of crime - they weren't given back to rightful owners after retracing a chain of custody.
The other thing that contradicts your argument is that you've picked one case - of confiscation, not return to rightful owners - and ignored the thousands of cases of failure to retrieve stolen coins (in a large proportion of cases, failure to even find them).
It's a triviality that government agencies, possessing a force monopoly, can seize assets, albeit it is general much harder with Bitcoin.

Segwit + 2MB hardfork would be an 8MB max block size; what research there is suggests &gt; 4MB is dangerous as of now. Also as a node runner myself I am not really looking forward to &gt; 2MB blocks, although I can handle it (some probably can't). Plus the 'hardfork' point is really important: it requires *everyone* using Bitcoin to agree. Controversial hard forks are *really* hard, probably never desirable. Uncontroversial is more workable, and that would take time. I've never been dogmatically against a block size hardfork, but you have to be realistic about the level of coordination required. That's why SW SF is such a great thing: you get a block size bump, you get a path to future scalability improvements (example: Schnorr, there are many others) that is realistic, and you *don't require everyone to upgrade*.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:30:47


It was never fast. 10 minutes is not fast.
Anyone who bought into Bitcoin because "transaction fees are basically zero" was just flat out not understanding what Bitcoin is.
But here's the ironic thing: **exactly those features can be achieved if segwit is activated, because with a malleability fix bi-directional payment channels, with no trust required, become practical**. And this is what miners are currently blocking.
(It's also true that segwit creates a block size increase to ~ 2MB, which would drastically reduce fee pressure; again, this could have been in place already since December if miners weren't blocking it).
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:50:47


Good question, and you're right I ignored that actually pretty crucial point. I am again going slightly on memory, but as I recall there is no security proof for ECDSA, whereas for Schnorr there is (under the random oracle model I think?). I remember looking into that Q a few months back.
That's one of a few reasons there's a push to include Schnorr type signatures in future Bitcoin updates (the other one is that they can be aggregated which ECDSA cannot).

It's all conjecture, but I *really* doubt this interpretation.
I predicted actions by Chinese govt in mid-December, because I remember their attitude in 2013 - they even released a long documentary after the price crashed, to convince their people that Bitcoin was risky because it was uncontrolled - with examples of people who lost their shirt.
Bitcoin is an embarrassment to them - it recovered and more or less exceeded those highs, at a time when they're very sensitive about capital flight. It's not that Bitcoin is *actually* facilitating much capital flight; it's that it so publically and visibly appears to flout their rules. That combined with it having a huge bull market is not something they want to tolerate.
All this stuff about "consumer protection" is just a convenient surface narrative. All the volatility they complain about over the past couple of months has been caused precisely by them.

This refers to the fact that rules that need to be *enforced*, can be enforced via this mechanism. Such as the integer overflow bug that Satoshi fixed in 2010. He pushed a new version of the client and had the miners enforce it, overriding the old (with-bug) chain after a short period. He **did not** have the miners vote on it, or any other protocol rule whatsoever.

You can't really have one utxo per user, but, absolutely, it's definite that there's a connection. I guess I'd broaden from utxo set to also tx volume too. Both Schnorr (on-chain; see also how it could work with coinjoin) and Lightning-and-similar (off chain) are sensible measures that will help, without huge and probably impractical changes, in the short to medium term. Guess a huge topic though, a lot of other things could be said.

Yes, absolutely, the right way to look at it: if you feel content with the fact that you don't have direct ownership, and you have trust in the institutions which do have ownership, then it makes sense to prefer that kind of money over a bearer asset. This ought to be the default position for most; using raw Bitcoin is not for the faint of heart. 
And it is not an entirely binary thing: I've often tried to argue here that Bicoin is intended as a base layer (hard money), not as a retail payment system, and direct ownership is not suitable for many, in many situations. But building a retail-type layer *on top of* a trustless "hard money" layer makes a lot of sense, since the base layer is something you can fall back on (see Lightning network for a very sophisticated implementation of these ideas, but a trivial banking style payment layer, like Coinbase, can make sense too).
But you should factor into the discussion not *only* the sort of pure political "I want personal sovereignty" position, but also the moral hazard of the current system that arises because the printing press is under human control. See the newspaper headline in Bitcoin's genesis block and Satoshi's brief "pitch" in his first public announcement on the p2p forums.

No, it's as you say, clearly if you just set up a LN channel, move the coins, and then close it, you have only wasted resources. The idea is to re-use them, but note that routing via multiple nodes means you don't have to have a separate channel for each payment counterparty.

I still didn't get a response to [this]( comment:




A bit of clarification: Coinshuffle makes the ownership of outputs unknown to **all** participants. Joinmarket's approach makes it unknown to all *except* the "taker"; the one who pays for the service. That is what coinshuffle provides, albeit at the expense of some additional RTs. What it does *not* do is change the fact that participants have to 'share' the utxos they are going to spend.

Just sign it and put it anywhere you like, if you see value in that. No one is trying to censor it, and it doesn't need any consensus, plus: simply asserting it in a signed statement doesn't prove anything. See the difference to a double-spend database: you need to have consensus on time-ordering without a cpof to avoid censorship. Bitcoin's blockchain "proves" the correct time ordering in the sense that it's demonstrable what ordering everyone agreed on.

No, absolutely not, that's the crucial difference. It's incredibly difficult to open a *licensed* bank; banks need explicit permission from their base layer (central bank and its settlement systems) to route through that base layer. In contrast, nobody can stop an entity setting up shop as a "bitcoin bank" from anywhere in the world. Is that ideal? Certainly not, but it is *not* the same as having centralized control over the base layer, which then can censor who uses it, and leverage that power to control who provides services on top of it.

Serious question, do you really believe that naked short selling could suppress price globally in OTC markets to the tune of &gt; 30% price difference (just to choose a number)?
I find this to be quite ridiculous at face value, yet all the stuff I see on the net from gold/silver bugs treats it as if it were obvious 'fact'.

The reason you feel yourself winning this argument is because for some reason nobody is making the correct argument for the other side. Bitcoin is intended to provide actual ownership with no counterparty and censorship resistant transfer. It was designed with that goal in mind and it *had* to be, otherwise it would not have survived the attack of governments. It is *not* a competitor to banks' retail payment systems, it is a competitor to cash. Retail payment systems could be built on top of bitcoin (although it'd be a heck of a lot easier without the constant screaming/attack against doing it by many here!)

And the fact is that even with this small bump in size we still get a transaction throughput capacity increase from it.
@_date: 2016-01-02 07:14:28
You're wrong.
At the heart of the problem the book/film describes is the fact that all the bankers (at the large banks) who were taking ridiculous risks "knew" that the government would bail them out. For a few, that turned out to be wrong (specifically Lehman) but the implicit backstop massively skewed behaviour in favour of risk taking.
"Ridiculous risks" here doesn't so much just mean "dumb bets", it's more about small payouts when you win v large payouts when you lose. The classic example is the insurance contract or far out of the money option. Selling these entitles you to a small flow of income *now*, with the possibility of a large loss later. The "large loss later" is always somewhat favoured if you get your bonus this year; that's bad enough, but what's much worse is when the executives know that if that loss is large enough to disrupt the financial system, then the government will pay it for them anyway!
That the government was guaranteed to be able to bail them out, no matter how absurdly big the debts, is a function of the fact that the government has an unlimited blank cheque.
In a world where Bitcoin (or gold or similar) were used as money, the government would not have that power, which cuts off this obscene corruption at its root.

Not really, no. Charlie Lee's stated goal is to give segwit and lightning a chance to get tested in real world conditions. While I think that in itself is laudable, I completely reject the concept that activating segwit on Litecoin is somehow a "litmus test", segwit is far better tested than any previous update to Bitcoin, and Litecoin is a very small team of active developers such that if anything goes wrong, it will be because of a screwup they've made, nothing to do with segwit.
Also 'before it gets too crazy', let's be realistic, Litecoin is basically 100% unused for now (as are almost all altcoins).
Also a reasonable answer to:


would be that *Bitcoin is pushing to accept segwit* too, and in both Bitcoin and Litecoin cases it's only some miners who are blocking it.
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:53:12
On the contrary, I think the real point is that they certainly won't use public blockchains (i.e. something they can't control and whose properties doesn't really fit what they're trying to do). They might use them peripherally, timestamping hashes, perhaps.
Of course, if you look into all of it a bit deeper, you see it is highly questionable whether "blockchain technology" as they're trying to promote it makes any sense at all. But, meh, can of worms.
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:49:58
If you're doing transactions where it's critical to get confirmation quickly, use a wallet that estimates fees intelligently, and/or set it at a higher level.
My transactions are almost all of the type where the confirmation time is not really important (retail payments over bitpay or coinbase), and my wallet just estimates a "medium" fee according to the recent network conditions (I could be more stingy but don't see the need). But I had to include the word "rare" because you can be unlucky if the fee rate ramps up *after* you sent your tx to the network - in this particular sense, I do think there is definitely an issue with usability right now, which is why I think segwit needs to activate quickly. Not particularly hopeful on that point...
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:26:58
Not really, a lot of us paid little attention to XT and Classic. But now the miners are very actively involved (by blocking segwit *and* signalling BU), they are stating they will hardfork (whether it's true or not, who knows, but that is of signficance, Ver's opinions are not).
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:25:32
I do agree, but there is such a scenario as: miners act in self-interest, but short term and miscalculated: this could just be interpreted as "well Bitcoin doesn't work, give up on it", but it could also be simply that appropriate defensive action has to be taken to get them to see the light, or go away. Such defensive strategies might be enough to see off this threat long term.
There is also the non-economically-motivated miner, e.g. state actor attack. Again, response can be either give up or take specific defensive actions. Obviously that's an even harder case, but even there the defensive action option might work.

I didn't make that assumption, and you are again wrong. You seem to think you are talking to a simpleton.
The difference between someone like me and someone like you is that you get a reward; whether that reward outweighs your work/cost input is what defines the success/failure of your mining enterprise. In my case, there is no monetary reward, it's not a business. It's quite simple to see the difference.
And by the way I run a full node and do a fair number of transactions, as well as writing software that's helped millions of dollars become more fungible. Calling me a "bystander" in that context doesn't make you look very good, and it also doesn't counter any of the elements of the argument I made above.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:27:14
Appreciate the idea (visualisation) but it doesn't help to oversell - LN with current Bitcoin doesn't scale to *billions* of users in any reasonable modelling - consider how many channel opens and closes are needed for that many users. LN devs themselves have been at pains to point this out. While it gives near-infinite scaling for individual users (in the sense that the blockchain places no limits on how often you can transact within a channel), it doesn't mean a near-infinite number of users can be supported.

"No one has seriously thought about attacking p2sh, since there is no profit in testnet coins."
Of course people have thought about attacks. The validity of this argument reduces to 'any update is by definition risky'. OK; good reason to (a) be very cautious and (b) don't do updates without huge testing and (c) don't do needless updates. 
Segwit fixes a fundamental design bug in bitcoin, increases the block size, creates significant scalability improvements, and enables genuine scalability and innovation. It was tested on three different testnets over more than a year, reviewed in detail by basically every Bitcoin expert on the planet, and they all either think it's the right way forward, or at least consider it viable.
And again, is anyone still using segnet4 (or was it 3 last)? I used that literally a whole year ago, and segwit is now active on testnet.

They could do that today though, if, as they claim, what they want is either much bigger blocks or some new version of Bitcoin's rules ('emergent consensus').

In the case of a *contentious hard fork* both sides would be hobbled. That's why the "side" of people who actually are actively involved in Bitcoin development have been so outspoken against a hard fork, when the goal can be achieved with a soft fork. There's no need to coerce other users to use the new features.


Good, because SW *is* an increase in block size to ~2MB (with a theoretical max around 3.7MB). Segwit *is* the compromise, allowing both bigger blocks to a limited extent, and *real* scaling via other vectors.
Just because you hear two sides arguing loudly, doesn't mean the middle between the two is the right place to be.


If the opinion of these people matter a huge amount, just because they are rich, or just because they hold hashing power, then Bitcoin has completely failed. Hash power is intended to come to consensus on transaction ordering, not protocol rules. Otherwise miners could just get together each week and determine the new size of the block rewards - or, much better, we just revert to Paypal, because that's what will eventually happen.


You've completely missed the point I'm afraid. *Social consensus does not scale* - that's why as long as there are discussions about evolution of the protocol, we will always be on thin ice. The solution is *not* to introduce more 'governance mechanisms' - the end of that road is only ever centralized trust based systems. The protocol has to get locked down, and innovation must move to other layers. You can build trust layers on top of a trustless protocol, but you emphatically cannot build trustless layers on top of trust-based base layers.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:14:47
On your first sentence, OK, we can call it a 'design bug' as a compromise :) It is just flat out wrong design-wise, but I concede it doesn't count as a 'bug in Bitcoin'.
On the second, well not really; well before all this argument about segwit started, there were endless complaints about malleability, although it only really started after the MtGox incident and people started talking about it. The main problem people had was that chains of unconfirmed transactions weren't safe, as i recall. But nowadays it's mostly about the fact that more advanced features like Lightning are impractical because of it.
@_date: 2017-03-01 10:00:22
What "free market block sizes" *actually* means, in practice (especially if you plan to use "emergent consensus", which is a travesty of satoshi's original design - using pow to decide on transaction ordering, **not** protocol rules like max block size), is a small cartel of miners having total control over this crucial variable, enabling them to create a scenario where ordinary users (even ones with reasonable consumer hardware) cannot independently verify the blockchain, without that feature we are only 1 or 2 steps away from Bitcoin just becoming another Paypal.
A "free market for block size" might sound nice, but when you look into it it's a catastrophe. At a high level it's easy to understand why - imagine that we all used gold as our store of wealth, and every day there was a town hall meeting to decide what properties gold should have "on Tuesday, we voted to make gold more orange-coloured", Wednesday it became heavier etc etc. This is completely not viable for something with such inertia as a currency/store of value. Its properties **should not** be subject to change. In Bitcoin's case, the most critical property of all is its **independent verifiability**, without that it is utterly worthless.

That's a pretty strange question/idea. I could transfer my BTC into a sidechain, thus I would still hold the private key to those coins in the sidechain, and so could transfer them back when I chose. Giving coins to Bitstamp means surrendering control of those coins entirely and trusting them to honour an agreement about giving them back under certain circumstances. That's the only context I can imagine in which you could see an analogy.
And no, transferring to a sidechain is not *just* sequestering them: the idea is that you could use them on the sidechain (which might have some different functionality than the main chain).

All the available utxos in one mixdepth can be consumed when you spend. Think of it this way: you put 1 coin into your JM wallet; you actually need to spend it. When you do, you may create a change output (usually you will of course). We can't enforce isolation of that change output from the original mixdepth it was spent from, as this would mean creating a new mixdepth/identity for each transaction, i.e. they would grow infinitely. So we make a specific promise: **that the coinjoin output is not recombined with the inputs or the change output**. Take a look at the diagram for 'canonical joinmarket transaction' [here]( Simple arithmetic can usually figure out, just from looking at the transaction on the blockchain, which change outputs are connected to which inputs. So there's no point trying to put them on separate branches, even if the infinite regression problem I mentioned above didn't exist.
So, back to external/internal distinction: the function of the external branch is to give the user a place to get receiving addresses (for sending into the wallet), safe in the knowledge that Joinmarket itself won't erroneously also choose to use these addresses to send to. So a coinjoin output at mixdepth 1 will always be an *internal* address (note: this is for cases where a wallet pays to itself, if you are doing a coinjoin as a sender, your coinjoin output is usually going outside the wallet). This is actually something that was fixed, see [this](

Segwit *is* a scaling solution - at least doubling on-chain capacity directly via the size of blocks.
Segwit offers scalability improvements - e.g. linear vs quadratic sighashing - directly.
Segwit helps create a path to other, bigger scalability improvements - example a soft fork to include Schnorr signatures which can considerably compact signatures through aggregation.
Segwit, most importantly of all, fixes malleability - a serious bug in Bitcoin - which means more complex contracting works properly, which means fully fledged payment channels actually work - this is *real* scalability in the way that the blockchain on its own can never deliver.

One of the biggest weaknesses in ECDSA is non-random nonces or re-use nonces (the latter being a private key leak). This has been exploited in the wild in Bitcoin. The best way to address nonce randomness failure is probably [RFC6979]( and Core and many other wallets (probably almost all now?) use it. An implementation of this is provided by libsecp256k1.
It's interesting to note that even slight bias in nonce randomness can be exploited, theoretically, by more advanced things like lattice based timing sidechannel attacks (from what I've read), but I don't see that ever being realistic in Bitcoin scenarios(?); from what (very little) I know, it hasn't been done in practice on anything else either.
For your 2 and 3, not generally, since the actual network runs mainly Bitcoin Core with libsecp256k1, but if you look hard enough you can find wallet/bitcoin software that does just about anything :)
Re 1, with the pubkey hashing, it defends against future quantum attacks to use the hash, but apart from that it's not, I believe, a weakness to use pay-to-pubkey as long as ECDL is not broken. And since spending reveals pubkey, if there were such a weakness, then any re-used address could be exploited.

@_date: 2016-01-16 12:48:25


Of course! That's the whole reason behind Bitcoin's otherwise very strange design. It *had* to be immune from government attack, else it would simply not be allowed to live. Witness egold, liberty reserve (and in a different way, digicash).




Yes, it's a bearer instrument/cash. Glad to see you get this; even some pro-bitcoiners don't seem to :)
What you're not taking into account is the extent to which it might be impossible for governments to enforce any asserted property rights to coins. An important detail that most don't understand at all is the extent to which Bitcoin supports fungibility because each transfer (transaction) is a many to many mapping. If the inputs are A, B and the outputs are C, D then (a) you cannot infer common ownership of A, B and therefore you cannot deduce the origin of C (depending on the amounts); it might be from A or B or both. This makes it *more* fungible (although still much less private) than cash in a *theoretical* sense, albeit in practice today most don't use it that way. 
This second point is connected to the first one: if you see Bitcoin as being subject to government/legal mandates, then it seems quite obvious it should already be shut down, since private currency is illegal in most jurisdictions. However, it is not shut down, so first you have to explain that before you try to construct a legal definition of property for bitcoins. And when you do try, you will fail, for the technical reason I explained above (but again, I don't hold out much hope for people to 'get' this, as most bitcoin proponents don't either).
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:26:32
You're misinterpreting it: this simply means that transaction validity is enforced by acceptance into blocks, it doesn't mean that the rules of transaction validity are decided by hashpower.
Key word: **enforced**
This played out in the early days of Bitcoin: Satoshi had to introduce a number of new rules (in some cases due to bugs) by propagating a new version of Bitcoin to nodes/miners, and the new rules were *enforced* by hashpower - not decided by it!
Example: the 2010 integer overflow bug. Satoshi writes patch, distributes patch (accepted unquestioningly), old chain gets overwritten by new chain once enough hashpower is enforcing it.
If hashpower gets to decide rules, it can decide what the block reward is, as well as the blocksize. That is categorically *not* what Satoshi intended.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:00:20


This understanding lacks a crucial detail - consensus on transaction ordering is established through hashrate, not consensus on protocol rules. Majority hashrate cannot reset the block reward, for example.

Maybe not precisely the same topic as you're discussing, but: 
Are you familiar with the idea of using merkle trees and Pedersen commitments in this context? 
You can for example place exchange account balances as leaves in a merke tree and publish the root, then customers can verify their leaf and request the path to the root as proof.
This leaks a bit of information, for example the total exchange holdings, so not ideal.
But using Pedersen commitments to amounts instead of amounts can largely solve that problem.

BU published the fix, and therefore the bug, on their public github repo:

@_date: 2017-03-02 07:49:24
Ethereum has appallingly bad scaling, you're right.
As others noted, it hasn't been used enough yet to see that - although that's not completely true, already by a few months ago you'd regularly see people on IRC complaining that they couldn't sync the chain - and this is something 1/6th-1/8th the age of Bitcoin with almost no usage initially. (And yes, I know that the worst of this was during specific DOS attacks, but I remember these complaints from before that time.)
Their attitude to syncing problems is, of course, "just check the right hash on the web". According to them there's no need to sync the blockchain.
They will tell you that "sharding" will magically solve all problems. VB is good at making up cool sounding buzzwords. When you read the page on sharding, what you get is a long waffling diatribe that half way through sneakily throws in proof of stake to "ensure" that everything works correctly. No surprise really - Paypal can "shard" quite effectively since it's centralized.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:26:25
I don't count 1.7-2.1MB with current transaction patterns and the potential to go higher than that, as tiny. Btw many "big blockers" were proposing a 2MB blocksize a year or two back. And, there is scientific research indicating &gt; 4MB is definitely not safe.
We cannot just blindly 'scale with adoption rate' if you want 100s of millions to adopt. It will make bitcoin completely centralized, and it won't really work (at some point it'll just be better to go with a centralized simple database, so much more efficient if only a tiny set of entities can hold and verify the blockchain anyway).
@_date: 2017-03-02 09:49:58
I know at least one other person received this (not me). Maybe they target new accounts. To be honest, unpleasant as it is, it wouldn't bother me that much, except that it *starts* with a complete lie (1MB).
I personally think the mods should sticky a message at the top of the sub saying "segwit is a blocksize increase to ~ 2MB" with details in the comments, so newcomers at least see the fact at one point.
I admit that this kind of propaganda war is  at some pointless, but still.
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:37:03
I also agree, but there are limits. Bitcoin *should* hold up against any DOS attack, but to the extent that we're all good actors, we don't want to test and find major weaknesses on the live chain. Notable that Satoshi's last public message (or second to last, I forget) was something like "there are still too many DOS weaknesses to count".
It's prudent to ask in public before attempting a large-scale experiment, so I guess you're doing that. Honestly at first glance it doesn't look that big anyway.

I suspect from this, that you're misunderstanding something. BIP9 signalling **is not a vote**. It's just a way to signal readiness for upgrade. Miners do not have a vote of any sort in the protocol rules. Their business is only to include and order transactions in blocks. So miners not signalling segwit after several months, blocking crucial scalability improvements, is a problem. Now, if it were the case that there were technical difficulties delaying them, that'd be one thing; but we have more than one large mining pool saying openly that not only will they block the upgrade, but they will attack the chain with a hard fork. So this is clearly not just delay.
Under these circumstances, PoW change *must* be considered, it's irresponsible not to, since if one company with a monopoly on asic fabrication decides to hard fork against the community's will, continuation of a minority hashpower chain is under existential threat.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:23:22


You certainly *can't* tell us that, and it's false. There was even a recent letter signed by several exchanges (representing a big chunk of economic activity in Bitcoin), saying precisely the opposite.
Would these supposed "major businesses, wallets etc." continue to follow the majority hashrate if it gave itself 100 BTC block rewards?

's (good name eh) summary covers good ground on this (edit: and 's, we're all here:) ), but I want to add some more "circumstantial" details about the use of IRC, messaging and Sybil.
1. Use of [end to end encryption]( means a central server (IRC or anything else) doesn't know the ownership of the coins, and cannot tamper/MITM the coordination process once it's started. Authentication to bitcoin keys owning the utxos to be used in the join is used to ensure this part.
2. Censorship by the single IRC owner is possible; that's why has been working on a multiirc branch, as mentioned. More generally, we do want a more scalable and less censorable messaging layer. PRs welcome!
3. Sybil. That was the first question I had about joinmarket when started the project ([here]( It is not really an issue with IRC, since a decentralized messaging system has the same issue (central server changes the model of attack, but both are Sybil vulnerable in principle). We had long discussions (on IRC, I guess not ironically) about what we can do to defend against this without resort to persistent identities. I'd point to [this]( gist, which is referenced in [this]( vague roadmap for a 0.2 version of Joinmarket (see section 0.2.0 Upgrade the protocol).
Lastly, the general topic of 'what is the best messaging layer/tech' to use has gone on forever. It's worth considering what properties it needs to have for our use, see the bullet point list [here]( I mention it just to illustrate to the casual reader that it's quite a tricky thing, or seems to be.

This is a failure to understand the concepts 'cash' and 'settlement'.
Consider two scenarios for gold-as-money:
* Gold (in coins) only
* Gold (in coins) and a system of certificates/IOUs representing ownership
The former case is cash, **which is itself immediate settlement**. There is no need for the concept of settlement here.
Only in the latter case, with 2 layers, does settlement mean anything. You "settle" payments with certificates by converting the certificate into gold.
So saying "Bitcoin was meant to be cash, not settlement" is a huge misunderstanding. Cash **is** settlement.
What we need is to preserve Bitcoin's properties as cash (a payment with no trust required); then we can either build higher layers or not, as we please.

Bolded part is really false. Even at times of highest fees, if you pay the fee, it gets confirmed in the next 1-3 blocks. Those who don't actually use Bitcoin but just read media reports get the wrong idea; it's not that "you have to wait hours to get your transactions processed" it's just that some people don't use dynamic fees, or deliberately choose "low" fee settings.


Bitcoin's original ideals did not include free transactions forever. That's literally impossible.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:23:17
This is often brought up as a concern about LN; I think it's entirely valid, but missing the point. Once we have the malleability fix + the segwit block size bump, we have lots of room to grow: first, more on-chain transactions by a factor ~2 (which will take quite a while to get used up I think), plus - and this part is much more guesswork right now - we can start using Lightning for some categories of payments, easing space requirements further. *Further down the line* it may become the case that the combination of Lightning volume, and on-chain fees, starts to cause problems with practicality of Lightning - but that would be in a scenario of huge success, where both on-chain and Lightning are being used a huge amount; and the latter could scale up the tx volume by a *huge* factor.
And it's not as if these are the only tools we have available. Consider Schnorr which could massively compact the amount of space needed for signatures (signatures are the bulk of the on-chain space).
IOW this is the kind of problem we want to have .. at a much, much larger scale.
If you're concerned about being 'locked' to certain 'hubs', well I don't know, the whole concept of Bitcoin is permissionlessness, nobody can be stopped from running a LN and you can't be stopped from routing through them. Otoh if some people choose to do all their transactions via coinbase for &lt;insert reason&gt; then that's entirely their prerogative.
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:52:53
No, it's not "kind of", it is a block size increase. Total size of transactions passed over the wire in a block is (can be) bigger.
As for downsides, you should elucidate them, maybe you could get some misunderstandings cleared up (I say that specifically because there have been enormous reams of nonsense spouted, especially on reddit but also elsewhere, to cast aspersions on segwit).

No, it's not clear that that's what will happen, although that's definitely a possibility (maybe likely?). Segwit gives ~2MB immediately, which could conceivably go up to ~3MB if transaction types are switched a lot (theoretical max just below 4MB but I don't think that's realistic), meanwhile Lightning (which is already a functioning protocol, but obviously untested at any scale) can be a game changer in terms of creating a huge increase in transaction throughput, and aside that, things like schnorr signatures could create another big scalability boost.
A later hardfork is still an open question I believe, but it has big limitations because the base protocol is broadcast - *every* participant must process *everything*. If technology (especially bandwidth) improves a *lot* then it may well be that a blocksize increase bump would be so uncontentious that it's sensible to hard fork for it (there were a number of BIPs along these lines). But this is a "scale" increase not a "scalability" increase and will always have limited effect compared to a real scalability increase that takes *trustless* transactions off-chain as something like Lightning can do.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:39:05
Strongly disagree:
* A PoW switch suddenly and massively reduces Bitcoin's security against external attackers; there is nothing that comes close to the current scale of sha2 asic PoW.
* A PoW switch harms honest miners who have done nothing to attack.
* It's very hard to make it work as a soft fork, which means a hard fork, which is a huge coordination/disruption problem.
PoW switch is a nuclear option, it should exist only to prevent existential attacks I think.

@_date: 2017-03-01 17:13:02
I very much hope you're correct on that last point ... (there is such a thing as repeat business, remember).
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:25:59
You are completely wrong.


Bitcoin's design was based on miners being anonymous actors. Miners are not "the backbone", they are simply actors trying to make a profit. To whatever extent that they are not anonymous actors, it represents a deterioration, if not a catastrophic one, in Bitcoin's model.
The miners *as a group* thus cannot be the "backbone" of anything, nor can the users, nor can the developers, as those groups are fundamentally not defined and entry/exit is permissionless (it's not even recorded anywhere). Again, all by design. As soon as you start talking about "us miners", "fellow miners" you've strayed from the intent here. If you want to make it "the team of miners vs. the users", you haven't just strayed, you've completely lost the plot.


Many developers have done all that - put years of work in, but here's the difference: they haven't been richly rewarded with directing minting out of all that work. But somehow miners are heroes or something? **You are engaged in a business - and your support or not for Bitcoin as a currency is entirely separate from that business** If you want to be celebrated as being a *supporter* through thick and thin, great, I celebrate it, but that's you as a Bitcoin *user* (even just hodling), not you as a *miner*.
If you want to call people like me 'bystanders' because we don't mine on the other hand, then take me as an example - I worked 2+ years for free to help people regain fungibility in Bitcoin, but I don't think that entitles me to *set the rules of Bitcoin's protocol* - am I a 'bystander'? Or take a more obvious example like any famous Bitcoin developer, are they 'bystanders' if they don't have a mining rig? I would argue it's much more appropriate to call *you* a bystander if you don't keep up with the latest software updates (do you understand Lightning well enough to explain it?)
Finally, on signalling SW - it's not a vote, it's a process designed to allow you to signal your readiness for the upgrade. **Miners are not supposed to be setting the rules of Bitcoin's protocol**. Jihan's attempt to change that is guaranteed to fail - the only question is whether he takes the entire system down with him.
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:36:44
How can building layers on top of that settlement make it worse? Consider: right now there is a 2nd layer, for example: coinbase-coinbase payments without fees. Is that a violation of Bitcoin? And if, in future, you can have a similar 2nd layer, without having to trust a third party, how can that not be strictly better?
So you see, there is no argument: the base layer is and always will be cash, as long as we keep its properties intact. Whether people choose to have other layers above it is up to them.
What you are really arguing is that the base layer should remain essentially cost-free. We'd all prefer that, but the base layer has an absolute requirement to be trustless, and that is costly, because it is a broadcast (all-all) layer.

There's a serious point too - most people don't actually *want* to use internet *cash*, most of the time. A trusted third party takes away all the hassle. I am no cheerleader for Coinbase, but just generally consumers are going to prefer a credit card style model where they don't have to remember secrets and keep them safe, and they have easy recourse when something goes wrong.
Meanwhile having the *option* of the no-trusted-third-party model would be a huge boon, both for those who would use it and those who would only have it as a fallback. So, yeah, both should be ideal I think.

2MB is what Classic was asking for (at least at one point, it's hard to keep up).
Calling it "efficiency" increase instead of capacity increase just seems like an attempt to pretend it isn't what it is - a block size increase.
Of course it's not enough for long term if you want 1 billion people, but then nothing else is either. "Bigger blocks, as big as you like" does not get you there. VISA or Paypal gets you there, and if you try to apply dumb non-solutions you will just devolve to that.
See this is why people like Fenton take *so* long to get it clear - because of the endless stream of people for some reason using every kind of weasel words to avoid stating the simple truth that segwit is a blocksize increase. This fact is **critical** because outside observers think compromise is appropriate, but they don't know that segwit already *is* that compromise (on scale, specifically).
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:00:24
Agreed, but it'll give people a misleading impression. The *precise technique* for aggregating the public keys may need review, but the general concept of aggregation is just a given with Schnorr (which has a security proof under ROM, whereas ECDSA doesn't). So yeah it's a way off, but it's not like it's some dubious new technology that has a 50% chance of working.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:43:13


Anthing's possible, but a crucial feature of open source software is that no one requires permission to review the code. So if, say, the top 10 developers all decided to push a malicious fix (however outlandishly unlikely that is), the 11th or 100th will notice the malicious nature and alert people.
There is no perfect system, for sure, but even collusion between a large set of people who have trust is not enough to violate security in the most egregious manner. It can happen, but it is *not* easy, not at all. Compare with a closed source system, very different.

This is the old blacklisting debate.
If address A is effectively blacklisted, globally across all countries, all exchanges, all accepting merchants etc etc, which means global cooperation of government agencies for a start, then the owner just has to use decentralized coinjoin (see joinmarket) or a darknet mixer (adds risk of stealing and snooping by operator and costs more, but gets extra obfuscation) or altcoin exchange (still snooping and stealing risk, more cost) to obfuscate the linkage.
When you think through blacklisting in detail like this you realize it's probably not going to work, although it's possible that people will try very hard, and maybe for those users who are not careful, it's going to be horrible because they will find themselves discriminated based on the history of their coins. I doubt it'll go that far but maybe.
However the only real nightmare scenario is whitelisting: not listing addresses you won't accept, but listing addresses you will and everything else by default is blocked. Still, this seems a million miles away today, and if it ever happened, people would stop using Bitcoin (and maybe just shift to something else).

Supply constraint is *not* a consequence of mining decentralization, it's a consequence of simply having verifiability (which even works with 1 miner). The fact that any user of the system can transparently see coin issuance and knows all transactions on the network so that none can be hidden, means that people will simply abandon a chain that doesn't follow the rules.
Dictators can enforce all kinds of things of course, but that has nothing to do with cryptocurrency.
Decentralization gives two things: (transaction) censorship resistance (if one miner won't mine your dirty tx someone else will) and removing the 51% attack from being a realistic threat.
We don't have those advantages "in full" today, although I think people overestimate how terrible the effect of quasi-centralization is. But we *do* have all the benefits of an open, verifiable system; this tends to get dramatically undervalued in the discussion.

Segwit IS 2MB.
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:59:27
Yes, that's right, but when people talk about Satoshi having a lot of coins, they're not talking about just that address.
Every 10 mins on average a new block is mined; during early 2009 it's widely believed that most of those were mined by Satoshi. So if you look at every block from 0 onwards (1,2..) up to some number, there's an assumption (which may be totally wrong, who knows) that Satoshi himself owns most of those 50BTC blocks.
Fun fact: the one you already looked at (block 0) is actually unspendable in the Bitcoin protocol.

@_date: 2017-03-30 04:25:50


This loses a critical distinction: miners are the arbiters of **transaction inclusion**, they are **not** the arbiters of Bitcoin's protocol rules.
Ideally, Bitcoin's protocol rules are just unchangeable. 21 million is not changeable. That existing utxos remain spendable on the network is not realistically changeable, even though there are sane suggestions occasionally to change that, I see no prospect of them getting anywhere.
Soft fork type protocol changes have some decent chance if they're not at all controversial. But if there is a very strong controversy obviously it's super-difficult, but the wishes of the people who use Bitcoin should obviously take precedence, since miners are paid by them to perform their service of securing a convergent ledger.

Last I heard CCT is broken (but the status seems to change :).
@_date: 2016-03-11 16:58:08
Well, first, I am the second biggest code contributor to Joinmarket, and I wrote a 20 page description of CT, and an analysis of privacy in JM, so I'm not clueless about this, albeit certainly knows JM better :)




It looks like you have a slight misunderstanding of JM's particular coinjoin flavour. Each JM transaction has "coinjoin outputs" and "change outputs"; it's only the former that are all equal. The change values are distinct for each counterparty; that's a tradeoff - it means people with different utxo sizes can do joins, and allows the fact that the change outputs can be linked with the inputs. The privacy gain comes from the fact that the equal coinjoin outputs completely obscure the linkage of those outputs. The diagrams [here]( may help.
CT would radically strengthen this of course, since the distinction between 'coinjoin outs' and 'change outs' becomes irrelevant. All that's needed is for multiple parties to be combining inputs; this would remove the "all inputs are necessarily from the same party" assumption which is used by wallet analysis tools today (although of course not completely successfully because of coinjoin).
I guess nobody's thought through all the details, but that would I think be the gist - there is no longer any need for clever amount trickery - you could literally just "merge" N totally different transactions if all the amounts are blinded, then the 'wallet closures' will over time just grow without bound, and blockchain analysis would be reduced to only achieving very trivial deductions.

Because it's not a vote.
It's designed as a mechanism to allow miners to signal that they're *ready* for the upgrade, that's all. This went completely smoothly for the 2 previous soft forks, using the exact same mechanism in 2016.
The problem here is that miners are literally trying to take control of the protocol. This simply represents an attack.

The headline doesn't convey the meat of the statement, it seems to me. Look at the statement and read between the lines:


even if 
 the BTU chain has more hashing power. Some exchanges intend to list BTU and all of us will try to take steps to preserve and enable access to customers’ BTU. However, none of the undersigned can list BTU unless we can run
chains independently without incident. Consequently, we insist that the Bitcoin Unlimited community (or any other consensus breaking implementation) build in strong
two-way 
 replay protection.
The actual message is "Unlimited" will be BTU, not BTC, *even if it has more hashing power*, and we will not touch it unless they do replay protection properly.

Seems to be a common question. I gave a detailed answer [here]( just the other day.
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:03:36


Absolutely not! It's really disappointing that people don't understand this basic architecture of the system:
* The miners do POW to resolve dispute over **transaction ordering**
* The protocol rules are decided upfront, and are enforced by the entire system since all transactions are out in the open. There is no vote, there is no PoW mechanism. 21 million coins because we *all* agree to it.
If the second seems suboptimal - sure, there is no easy way to make upgrades to the system if there's even a *small* conflict over it - good if you *like* that the system has a lot of inertia (and it sure does!), bad if you don't - which is why hard forks are such a bad idea with any controversy, **because then everyone has to update their protocol rules**. With a soft fork they don't.
The idea that implementing a soft fork could be seen as "exerting control over miners" is a suggestion that miners somehow *own* the system, that it is up to them what the transaction rules are. I can't believe anyone really thinks that? A Bitcoin whose entire rules (including censorship of transactions perhaps) are set by miners is to me *worse* than the current system of money, not better.
As the email explains, soft fork "activations" were for managerial convenience, not voting! (that's why the term 'signalling' was used; miners are supposed to be anonymous, they're just letting each other know *on the blockchain* that they're *ready* by signalling, not "approve/disapprove" as some are now trying to abuse it).

For sure there's *some* truth to that - Bitcoin in itself doesn't scale very far from where it is now.
But that's only the end of the story if you don't see Bitcoin for what it is - a censorship resistant digital cash *or* settlement (cash *is* settlement, by the way) layer. The intentionally restricted smart contracting features, though, allow for building trustless layers on top of it, which give the features that people really want - speed and low fees - without compromising the censorship resistance of the base layer. However, a critical design bug - malleability due to non-segregation of witness - has to be fixed first.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:25:54
This is false in more than one sense. One important sense: nobody doesn't want to increase the throughput, and in particular, segwit roughly doubles the blocksize and so greatly increases the throughput, the code is live on the network now; only the miners are blocking it by choosing not to signal.
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:36:33
I know people don't want to hear it, but 2MB HF after segwit is not well supported by the tech people I know; it means an 8MB max actual block size. A *lot* of people think that is not at all workable, except maybe in a further future if things like bandwidth increase a lot.
Don't forget segwit is not *just* a blocksize bump to ~ 2MB, it's also opening a door to other potential scalability improvements on-chain, like Schnorr aggregation.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:14:23
BU isn't unpopular for petty political reasons with the devs, it's a complete destruction of Bitcoin's consensus design.
Hard forks are also totally unpalatable without overwhelming consensus. Segwit gives a block size increase to 2MB without that risk.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:22:45


Segwit is a blocksize increase; it could have been active on the network for 2 months if it wasn't being blocked by miners. So that makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:43:14


Segwit is a block size increase.

Bitcoin *is* a settlement system **precisely because it is cash**. There is no inbuilt reversal mechanism (and could not be if we don't want TTP, which is the entire point).
When you pay something on the street with cash notes the receiver gets immediate and final settlement, modulo trust in the issuer of the notes (the government).
The more I read of the article the more I get the impression that the author doesn't understand what settlement really means.


This completely garbles the point. Gold wasn't used as a **non-settlement** payment system first; it was used as cash, direct payment with no counterparty risk - complete and final settlement such that you don't actually need the word "settlement"!. 
The concept of "settlement" only arose after secondary payment layers on top of gold (IOUs, certificates) became commonplace.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:23:42


I don't think you're alone, at all, in that perspective - the problem is the nature of hard forks. They require disruption of the entire network, carry technical risks and even a small and sufficiently committed set of disagreeing people could result in a permanent second fork, which opens up a world of mess (e.g. replay attacks, but that's just one aspect..).
That's why discovering that segwit could be done as a soft fork and allow 2MB blocks without the above, was considered such a great win.

I'm not sure of the exact figure, but you're looking at the "percentage of blocks signalling" - these are created precisely by miners.
Btw there are some stats out there indicating the percentage of nodes that are segwit ready is 80+% and Core 90+% - this is *nodes*, just people running Bitcoin, not miners. But whatever those numbers they are not something to rely on (can always be faked if someone wants to go to the effort), at best an indication.


A second layer would indeed not be touching the base layer code, just as TCP/IP code is not 'touched' by TLS/SSL code.

If it doesn't transfer eventually, it never left. Transactions are atomic, i.e. "all done" or "not at all".

Segwit is larger blocks, so you do see a sane proposal for it.
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:11:01
Sarcasm aside, there is something to be said here; it's actually the norm rather than the exception that fraudulent transactions are rolled back. IIRC in the recent Bangladesh case, ~ $1bn was transferred but all but ~ 80m was rolled back.
However, it doesn't always happen, because actual *settlement* has to occur at some point. The obvious example is: trying to roll back a $1m transfer from a US bank account to a Russian/Chinese bank account, some time after the event.
Another detail that I think a lot of people don't know about is that business accounts typically don't have the same protections as consumer accounts. Consumer accounts are typically completely protected from fraud, i.e. the bank has to take the loss if it can't claw the funds back. But for business accounts, it's the businesses that have to take the hit (usually, I think).
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:02:39
I wonder can we get some kind of simple statement that all Core devs can sign on to, something along the lines of "The use of SHA256 is not fundamental to Bitcoin's protocol, and while highly disruptive, we are prepared to commit to offer a version of the Bitcoin software that uses a different PoW function in these cases: (1) Where there is a significant theoretical break in the SHA256 algorithm (2) Where the network comes under active attack from miners attempting to prevent Bitcoin's smooth functioning. We realize that this is neither desirable (due to adverse effect on honest miners) nor a complete fix to the problem in case (2) (since future attacks may occur), but it must exist as an option to prevent the complete shutdown of the network's functioning (to process Bitcoin transactions)." That kind of thing.
One reason I ask is because it seems that there are some fairly influential people in the community that are laboring under the misapprehension that SHA256 PoW *defines* Bitcoin's protocol rules, which it absolutely does not.

Not possible because segwit is 2MB blocksize, so you can't be pro-segwit and against a block size increase. Also segwit has other *scalability* improvements (not just scaling).

That's *mostly* true, but even if you are not a criminal or a dissident or something, there are plenty of mundane scenarios where access to your money can be blocked for all kinds of reasons.
But even if you don't have any reason, as an average person, to desire non-blockable payments, you may find that you could greatly benefit from what that kind of payment system *enables* on layers above it. That's a big part of Satoshi's original argument it seems to me.

I don't know the details, but as I understand there is no arbitrage because you can't liquidate these type of funds without a massive tax hit.
Just hypothetically, imagine a person had savings divided into some kind of bank savings account and one of these (retirement funds?) that can invest in GBTC. If you are currently holding say 100 BTC worth in GBTC and currently have more than that (say $100,000) in your bank savings account, wouldn't it make sense to sell your GBTC position, consider that as booked extra savings, and then (if you want) buy an equivalent BTC exposure using cash from your savings account? Not an arbitrage, but maybe a quasi-arb. Notionally, it's a massive risk free profit, at least in BTC terms.
Yes, it would only apply to people with a lot of liquidity, and only to people who are at least prepared to do what is needed to buy bitcoins and store them. So perhaps the arb persists at these outrageous levels because people who satisfy those requirements were never going to buy BTC via GBTC in the first place.

One of the enormous problems any new currency faces is its initial distribution.
Bitcoin can't claim in this to be egalitarian, it can only claim to be fair - by setting the rules in advance, by announcement in public before the start of minting, and even cryptographically proving that fairness via the newspaper timestamp in the genesis block.
The minting schedule being defined in advance is the most critical element to that fairness - which is why there will never be consensus for changing it.
Proof of work is crucial to this design - notice that if you started a coin with a proof of stake model, you have completely ignored this critical problem - either you create all the coins at startup, meaning the creator has everything to begin with, or you defer the problem to PoW by having a PoW bootstrap phase. Some projects have even assigned ownership to the creators anyway, even with PoW, thus totally abandoning an attempt to be fair.
And this is ignoring the (imo) fact that PoS is a fundamentally broken model, if you actually care about either decentralization or independence in general. If you don't, why bother with something as convoluted as a blockchain? Yet another critical problem with that model is that the rich get richer without having to do any work, but simply by merit of being rich.
Fiat is worse by far - there minting is not *only* a privilege only given to a central authority, but even worse, the minting schedule is not defined in advance.
Thus Bitcoin's gini coefficient started at 1.0 (with the first block of coins entirely in the ownership of the miner of the first block, presumably Satoshi), but has trended downwards ever since. You can't say that about fiat currencies, and you have no idea how the distribution will evolve in the future, since central banks have complete power over that.
It seems highly likely that this was a big factor in Satoshi's decision never to spend the large chunk of early coins he has (had), although we'll never know for sure.

Super-nerdy correction on one little detail in this rather-difficult-to-listen-to discussion: https does provide authentication indeed, but it does not provide non-repudiability - which is what digital signatures do. Overall I think you emphasised too little the extent to which what he's trying to achieve can all be done with digital signatures. It doesn't matter where they're stored, they only need to be stored in one place, precisely because they have non-repudiability.

Monero can't prune the utxo set. Also, pretty sure with ringct it's also going to have very big transactions (iirc they've reverted to the original borromean ring sig design because an earlier proposal was totally broken, and those range proofs are very large).

Typo or Freudian slip? :)
Your general thesis:
I think you're wrong in a number of ways, while being right in the basic observation of what people want, but the most important point I think people have always tended to miss is that Bitcoin itself doesn't fit the mould of a consumer payment system, I always put it as "Bitcoin is SWIFT not Starbucks points". Consumer payment systems make sense as layers built on top of it. Lightning style layers are a huge step up in making that a reality while keeping the trustlessness, but there is nothing inherently wrong with even *centralized, trusted* layers built on top of it, either. If the base layer is uncensorable the higher layers don't *have* to be either - although they can be! and many people will actually want that.


Much of that interest is based on zero understanding of what a blockchain is actually useful for.

@_date: 2017-01-07 11:04:44
A few considerations:
1. At say 10MB blocks, that's 10x6x24 = 1.44GB of data per day that each node is storing. It's true that disk space is cheap, but people do forget that the impact this can have on initial syncing of the blockchain (a new user) is enormous. Today they need to download 100 GB of data (this is necessary for independent verification - otherwise what's the point?), and verify it (CPU intensive even if massive speed up due to libsecp256k1) even if they can then prune that. This usually takes *days* currently (many hours even with the *best* conceivable consumer setup) How about 1 TB? It's coming, but it'd be coming like *immediately* with 10MB blocks. There is also the matter of bandwidth requirement - 10x bigger blocks means 10x more bandwidth requirement (I believe it's linear? it's at least linear) for all nodes operating in the "normal" mode, which for some people is a big deal.
2. Blocks have to propagate across the network, and miners have to verify them. These time delays can be critically important for the operation of mining. I'm sure the experts out there could write books about this, but consider the basic issue: any delay, even a few seconds, in receiving the next block, places you at an economic disadvantage compared to the competitor miner that already has it. In the crudest model, one can see an incentive to cluster and centralize - just one big miner eventually. See also "selfish mining" where withholding blocks can lead to more profit, I have a vague memory that this has been shown to be worse when blocks are larger.
I think a high-level picture is that the design of Bitcoin has a tacit assumption that verification time of blocks and propagation time of blocks is assumed to be negligible, but at some point that'll get violated (or - already is violated). Also due to point (1) above, there is no doubt that we have far fewer self-verifying nodes on the network today than we might have if blocks were smaller (not that I'm arguing for that), so making them much larger puts decentralization even more at existential risk.

That's because you're not verifying the chain. I can "sync" in seconds on my Bitcoin mobile wallet, but I don't trust that for real money.

Is high fees the number one support ticket? Then activate segwit, which increases the block size by roughly a factor of two. 
Since it can be done with a softfork, today, with no impact on users who don't use it (yes, even people using wallets not supporting segwit will still benefit from the increased throughput), whereas a hardfork is not available and cannot be with overwhelming support for many months or years (unless you don't care about consensus, in which case go ahead and hard fork, nobody is stopping you), it is not even a remotely viable alternative.
A lot of future improvements to Bitcoin either need a malleability fix or benefit greatly from it. People do sometimes complain about its effect, especially with zero confirms (see: MtGox).
So there is zero basis on which to say "don't support segwit because it's not the number one customer support ticket".

Bandwidth, disk space (not so much), verification time, propagation time for miners, initial sync, all of these things get more and more problematic as we increase from 1MB to &lt;insert your preferred&gt;MB. I am not looking forward to running my home node with 4MB blocks.

Wow, finally a comment from someone who has a clue.
A little detail that most missed - they crushed the overnight lending in the offshore market before the one-day massive rise in the Yuan, which triggered the first bout of selling in Bitcoin. A day or two later they put out the notice warning about Bitcoin's "volatility", and it started tanking again. It was quite amusing - they themselves were the direct cause of the volatility they were complaining about. Not an accident of course; just part of a broad scale attack against capital flight; with Bitcoin it's 95% optics because it's such a small market, no serious capital flight is moving over that channel.

segwit raises the block size to ~2MB. Please tell me you're not yet another person from whom this information has been hidden...
(Of course longer term we will come back to this problem if tx volume doubles again; but there is Lightning). Segwit could already be active and we could already have 2MB if the miners would just choose to activate it.

I suspect you're right, but I'm nearly sure it's because they are getting bad information from the Bitcoin media, which is presenting the issues *atrociously* almost across the board. Next time you're in such a situation please ask these people if segwit is a block size increase.

It's not that at all, in my opinion. Bankers as individual *people* might feel that way, or might not (plenty of non-bankers seem to!).
But as institutions, it simply doesn't fit within their framework. If there is jealousy at that level, it's much more about the fact that they (might) want to be part of a new, exciting technological/financial innovation, but they absolutely can't be involved in state-less money.
What I've found more interesting over the years than bankers, is economists. Every single one, at least the type that get mainstream attention, seems to catastrophically misunderstand Bitcoin.

The entire point of Bitcoin is that it *can* be stolen - that's what makes it like cash (a "bearer instrument" as sometimes said).
If it can't be stolen from you, you don't really own it (unless you postulate absolute perfect security). The level of security afforded by the asymmetric cryptography architecture is far superior to that of credit card credentials (whose "security" is based on non-ownership; if credit cards were irreversible it would be a security catastrophe), while comparing it with cash you can see both pros and cons.

Errant nonsense. There have been 3.7MB blocks mined on testnet. The actual maximum size of blocks passed over the wire, with segwit and with current transaction mixes, will be about 1.7-2MB.
I suggest you educate yourself about the facts rather than "listening to both opinions equally"  - the other side of the argument, currently, is some combination of flat out lies (like 'segwit is not a block size increase') and incoherent paranoid nonsense.
There are of course, interesting debates to be had, but they don't even get a look in, instead we have to continually refute lies.
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:50:08
I know what segwit is, I have written code to implement it. The details obfuscate the basic fact, which I repeat: it represents an actual increase in the maximum over-the-wire bytes sent in each block. And it represents an increase in the number of transactions that can be supported in each block. This is what actually matters to users in the context of the scalability debate that has been ongoing. And those users are being consistently lied to by a group of people trying to push an agenda, such that casual users don't even understand that it is effectively a block size increase to 1.7-2MB.
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:29:25
Right on both counts. The availability of margin is a huge benefit to speculative traders and hedgers as it reduces their counterparty risk, as per your example. Meanwhile the practical reality is that the majority of speculative traders are close to being hopeless gamblers, so instead of using the feature to remove counterparty risk, they stick ~ 100% of their money on exchanges, leverage up to the hilt to get their gambling addict's hit, and then at some point lose it all because they've massively increased their "risk of ruin".
The unfortunate effect is, that regulations are enforced to reduce leverage and "protect investors". It's total rubbish, it doesn't protect sensible users/investors at all but rather massively increases the danger if, in order to achieve a hedge (the non-speculative use case of these exchanges), they have to suffer immense counterparty risk.

I'm always quite bewildered by this perspective. You're talking about a tech that can increase the userbase by a factor anything from, say, 10x to 1000x, and your conclusion is: it doesn't help because it isn't 10000x?
Can bigger blocks "save the day", if saving the day means requiring &gt; 100x increase in user base?! (Spoiler: no).
I mean, let's completely set aside the fact that it can provide: considerable extra privacy, near-instant confirmation, and overall massively lower fees per unit of economic activity, within whatever scale it allows. Cos' that stuff certainly doesn't matter either, right?
I think there are tons of issues in the practical details, but people always seems to bring up bewilderingly nonsensical arguments against it like "you need to trust", "it's centralized", "it doesn't scale" - things that are so wrong it makes one's head spin.

I've never really believed these trusted execution/hardware approaches are really going to work in practice, because the trust model is just not right - "golden key" etc.
But the thing is, arguments aside, we should remember: the whole point here is that anyone can and should be able to choose to use the base layer any way they like - including setting up things with Intel based hardware. There's nothing anyone can do to stop them, and they shouldn't try. Just remember the critical thing is that the base layer *does* require consensus, and its decentralization should be defended at all costs.

1.7-2MB immediately is more than enough. If in the intervening period, more is needed, people can switch to other segwit transaction types and the limit will trend towards 3-4MB. All with segwit. You aren't offering any counterargument to segwit as providing exactly what you want, at all, here.
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:50:34
It's not a "2MB hardfork". It's a doubling of size, when we *already* have ~2MB maximum block size with segwit itself. That's why many of us are calling it "Segwit4X" or "Segwit8X" (theoretical max) because the way you say it causes total misunderstanding by every casual observer.

Just, no. There has been a whole *year* of testing of segwit. That's extremely serious work. Somebody implementing it on an altcoin (possibly badly), taking months, then finding a bug in their implementation tells us nothing.

Yes, distributed databases are very useful. So it can come down to a matter of semantics.
Adding digital signatures and hash chains (a la git) to a distributed database doesn't make it a blockchain, by my meaning of the term. See DMMS (section 3 of  Without that feature you don't get the much touted immutability.
Others are free to call whatever they like a blockchain, that's true.

False. There is nothing special about 2034. The assumption that rewards must be replaced by fees once 99% are mined is just that, an assumption.

No, it's not. Nakamoto consensus is a way of deciding time-ordering and thus which of N double spends "wins", *not* a way of deciding the rules of a protocol.


No; consider the extreme case of 100% miners choose a block size increase and 100% of other users are adamantly against it (hypothetical case). This would mean users ignore the miners' blocks and choose to start mining another fork in the chain (possibly with a PoW change to serve as defence against legacy miners).
I understand that practicalities work heavily against any such hypothetical scenario becoming real, I think that's an important discussion to happen. What is quite wrong though is to state that Bitcoin was designed to have miners vote on the rules of the protocol. It really wasn't. The fact that there's a "quorum-sensing" protocol for soft forks is really about safety, making sure that miners know what is happening before activating to avoid problems for them. Note if it was a voting mechanism, it would be crazy to use a 95% threshold.

For the 5000th time this is a completely insane way to look at it. (1) the number of transactions, the throughput, what people actually care about, corresponds to 1.7MB in that case, not 700kB. Second, the actual number of bytes passed over the wire is 1.7MB, not 700kB. The only reason you are choosing to read it as 700kB is to support your entirely intellectually bankrupt position that "segwit is not bigger blocks".
@_date: 2016-06-08 09:49:57
Another perfectly practical option is to put a limit order in at the midprice (so in that case limit buy at 576.5 or whatever). A bit like saying "I really want to buy now, but I don't *have* to buy *right* now".
The advantage of a market order is you get that price, right now (unless the market is moving really fast). Whenever you use a limit order instead, you are taking the risk that the price will float upwards and your bid will never get hit. Meaning that if you really *did* need to buy now, you might have to suck it up and buy at an even higher price than 580.

It's been a matter of discussion since 2012 or earlier. Your point would be a very valid one if it were not for the fact that, even since the very earliest days of the debate, there were people on the other side saying larger blocks are very dangerous and detrimental to Bitcoin (and no, it's not *only* ..). They clearly have a point, even if the majority don't agree that &gt; 1MB blocks are detrimental. And because they have that valid point, it is not uncontroversial. And because it's not uncontroversial, there hasn't up to now been any hard fork proposal that's got traction, because everyone who understands the system knows that a hard fork *really* needs to be uncontroversial.

This is not really about age. You know in 2014 when "Supernintendo Lawsky"  came here on reddit and told us all about his marvelous proposed "Bitlicense" for New York I told him that the reference to "virtual currency" peppered all over his document represented a kind of entry-level failure of logic:
Consider two currencies:
* One can be created by the trillions, any unpredictable amount, at any moment, by the flick of a pen after a meeting held by a small group of individuals
* Another has its supply fixed by an algorithm, and new creation can be verified by millions of people all over the world; creation outside the fixed schedule can be simply rejected. To participate in that fixed creation requires expenditure of a huge amount of energy.
Which one sounds virtual to you?
That's the argument I would use; but I know it wouldn't convince most. Many even make the argument it's virtual because it's not tangible (as if dollars are tangible!). If they say that after considering the above comparison, there's not much more you can do. People don't really like to be forced to think :)

I understand that perspective, but it seems superficial to me. Consider: it's not *really* free because like all such services you have to hand over a certain amount of identifying information.

Inelasticity of supply, basically.
When demand increases for most commodities, more supply is brought online, because the higher prices incentivises it; an oil well might be unprofitable to operate at $50 a barrel, but very profitable at $100 a barrel, so you restart it, and increase the supply, price tends to come back down. With Bitcoin there is no possibility of varying the supply *from mining*; you can of course get more "supply" in the form of people selling, but that's a different thing.
All that is a basic, simplistic, theoretical view. The reality might be different in a myriad of ways, and very difficult to analyze.
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:39:34


They still do (of course not *literally*; we're talking about averages not hard limits, as was always the case). Nothing has changed on that. They just cost more. They are highly likely to cost a lot less some time after segwit is activated (since segwit is a blocksize increase of a factor ~  2) My last four transaction confirmation times: 7 minutes, 1 min, 1 min, 24 min.
@_date: 2017-01-20 10:18:10


Well yes, but in that sense that is an open attack vector today. It can get much worse though, in the case where blocks are allowed to be much larger, so that individual transactions could also be much larger.
The fact that the increase in segwit is to the max block *weight* and not the size, means that the pre-existing 1MB restriction still exists for non-segwit transactions.
I'm not sure how much one should focus on the removal of the quadratic sighash dependency; for a start, it seems to be effectively a side-effect or an add-on to segwit itself, in that it's a change to how sighashing works implemented with bip~~141~~ 143 but it's not strictly about witness segregation (or is there a connection i'm overlooking? probably). Also in the absence of removing this quadratic dependency, one could use other cruder policy limits to prevent the quadratic blowup from ever mattering. But, it certainly does seem *much* better this way. A good example of "improving scaling, not just scale".
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:01:38


They did. Segwit is a 2MB block size limit (it can even go higher).

Apologies if it's pedantic, but I always want to correct this phrase "distributed trust", Satoshi's design does *not* distribute trust, it replaces trust with cryptographic verification. We're not trusting the distributed group to get the transaction ordering "right", we're *defining* the right ordering as being that published according to PoW heaviest-chain rules, and each user is verifying that cryptographically - both verifying the block hashes and verifying the digital sigs of the transactions.
I'm not pretending you can't make complicated arguments back and forth on this technical point, but the reason I always pick up on it is that the empty suit "blockchainers", along with a lot of other people, by watering it down to "distributed trust", think that it's basically just a voting system, i.e. political, a "community consensus" system, when it really isn't.

Complete nonsense. Where do you get this from? Of course it will allow more transactions.


Completely wrong. People who use segwit (p2sh/p2wpkh or p2sh/p2wsh in most cases to begin with) will get a direct fee saving, but others will get a fee saving too because fee pressure will be reduced due to blocks no longer being full. Also, multisig will get a larger discount but it is also a meaningful discount for non-multisig.


Schnorr as a soft fork will be much easier precisely because of the new design with segwit. True that if and when it gets used (don't assume it's trivial - apart from the soft fork, schnorr signature aggregation is interactive, which is a big deal in some circumstances), it will make irrelevant the discount advantage for multisig, but this is not a bad thing - that at some point in future we can improve scalability even more.

I don't see that it'd be like that at all. Lightning is cool tech, but untested in terms of its practical use cases. Personally I'd doubt that we'd see a sudden rapid on-ramp of users, it'd likely be slow and organic. And *if* it works out well, it'll be a huge boon to the ecosystem overall. Even if demand for on-chain transactions did fall significantly, from payments, there are tons of other use cases for the blockchain in terms of notarization etc. I don't think it'll work out like that at all, I think adoption will be slow. Meanwhile, if it does work out, the extra value it gives to Bitcoin (you can buy your coffees, you can be much more private for at least some payments, scalability is finally achieved etc) seems like a huge net benefit and will probably greatly increase the value of Bitcoin generally, and hence mining rewards.

Inferior in network decentralization, sure. Making blocks bigger will make that worse. Is it "inferior" because it is too popular, and therefore more expensive to use? Debatable. Is it inferior in terms of the quality of the software? No, that would be a ridiculous assertion; early versions of Bitcoin would simply not be able to operate on the current chain, modern versions can only handle the load due to massive improvements in performance (and of course there's tons of extra functionality, too).

Actually a more centralized decision making process generally leads to *faster* decision making.
The problem here is the idea that the miners are too small of a group. If 50% of bitcoiners were still miners, then it still might be quite fraught making signficant changes, and there would still be big arguments, but it would be something we could all just live with. It's much more difficult to live with it when just a few people have a deciding vote, and can use it to go against the will of most of the users.

I guess I had three reasons for getting involved in Bitcoin, one technical, one "ideological" (but not really the typical political ideas you hear), one personal - the personal one is regular experience of how horrible it is to have to use banks that have total control over your money. It's fine using banks and paypal if your life fits into the majority profile, if there's anything unusual about you, not so much.
Experiences like the above just push us much harder into wanting to use things like Bitcoin to avoid banks permanently. Even if it's crazy hard to do it, we still, some of us, will try very hard, because it's so appalling to be treated this way.
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:53:44
No, that's not the way the system is designed. How the system designed is that they decide ordering of transactions, not anything else. That's what they vote for; transaction inclusion in the blockchain.
If they decide everything, then we have a distributed Paypal - or not very distributed, currently. They can censor transactions, they can award themselves more block rewards, they can basically do anything.
The easiest example to understand is the block reward one: if *all* miners decided amongst themselves that the block rewards are to be doubled, and ran that code, the rest of the Bitcoin system - the holders and users, the exchanges, the businesses - would stop accepting the miners' blocks. It would be, of course, a catastrophe for everyone, but it would be possible for everyone to continue on the valid chain - the one without erroneous block rewards. If miners' maliciousness in this scenario extended to mounting attacks against the weaker, but valid chain, then a PoW change is possible.
"It's up to the miners" stated flatly, is false. It's nuanced.

It's not *principally* a scaling solution, i.e. that was not its main original intent. But it is a scaling improvement. One aspect of which is, it increases the block size.


Segwit has nothing to do with CT. LN are improved by segwit but LN doesn't require it.

But centralized layer 2 networks haven't got very far at all, and have been around for years. Decentralized ones are hard and even though we have a Lightning implementation now, it is based on the assumption of segwit.
Personally I don't buy this "working as intended", although I understand where it's coming from.
I agree that we should need overwhelming consensus for any change, but is it OK that perhaps as few as 2 or 3 people have the majority vote, and cast it based on petty politics (that are wrong anyway, not that that matters)?
@_date: 2017-01-21 20:27:40
He's not asking about a code variable. He's asking about the actual size of the block in bytes passed over the wire. That's what block size means.
You could counter and say, well the literal number of bytes is not what counts, what counts is can it fit more transactions. And the answer is yes, it can, so in that sense also it is a block size increase.
Those are the only two possible meaningful interpretations of "block size increase". Attempting to pretend that what counts is a particular code variable (block_size vs block_weight) is either sophistry or ignorance.

@_date: 2017-08-12 19:32:34
Personal experience suggests *at least* several months is OK, but, critical point to me is: you use physical backup normally as your fallback (while any everyday use, you use memory, so you don't *touch* the backup, which itself is important), but then, you can switch to memory-only in cases where that's useful (which is unlikely to be for long periods), such as when travelling. That's a key flexibility, to me. You don't have that with other approaches.

Yeah there's a subtle but important distinction - more nodes than 5000 is great, but it could still be a really bad situation if an ordinary person even in a fairly rich country has no realistic ability to run a node. And consider the Sybil problem, in such an identity-less system, we can easily have 10,000 reachable "nodes" controlled by a few well-funded individuals or corporations, but *you* can't verify the chain yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:51:53
It's impossible to know for sure, but there is a significant economic incentive, e.g. for businesses that do a lot of on-chain txs, to switch to segwit, specifically p2sh/p2wpkh (it'll be the easiest for compatibility) as soon as possible. I know on my main spending wallets I'm switching asap. The fees will be meaningfully lower directly, in cases where the tx has multiple inputs (this will be especially true for coinjoins). But we're not talking like 90% savings, rather 30% ish area I believe (back-of-envelope: 2 ins, 2 outs, p2shwrapped savings of ~ 31%, 4 ins, 2 outs, savings increase slightly to 34%).
That's direct savings, the much more significant effect is that blocks won't be full nearly so often, if some meaningful proportion of people use the new type. That is likely to cause fees to drop very dramatically.
But it's also very likely that that will be temporary - that blocks will eventually fill up again at about double the current tx/s throughput.

I've got to admit I'm appalled that this argument is gaining traction.
Segwit has been tested for over a year, on *multiple* testnets, by all the best Bitcoin developers (and a lot of other people!). Now it is added to Litecoin, a much smaller dev community and user community, there is no guarantee that they won't screw something up - in fact, I've heard offhand that they came close to doing so already. 
And somehow *this* is the litmus test? So basically all the work that the Bitcoin community has done on segwit for the past year is useless?
So not only is it completely irrational to treat Litecoin as the proving ground for segwit, it's also extremely dangerous (optically/politically, not technically).
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:27:30

Core is too "greedy" for creating software, for free, and in this case (segwit) increases the block size and therefore reduces fees for users? As for "taker miners into consideration", this would ultimately tremendously benefit miners because it would make what they mine far more valuable.

I don't completely agree with your central thesis, but going with it for a minute: why did they activate CSV? It certainly didn't help their revenue directly, did it? The answer is that it's a useful upgrade to the system, as worked out in detail by the development community, supporting important use-cases that are healthy for Bitcoin long term. Segwit is the same, except more so.

Yes, but we're only ever talking about the limit. When the limit is 1MB, that's not the "actual size" (it's not like every block *must* be 1MB), it's the maximum allowed. Same here, except it's a little more complicated, because the maximum size depends on what types of transactions are included. With the current mix of transaction types (particularly p2sh v p2pkh), we are looking at a realistic maximum of 1.7-2MB if segwit were activated today; it could go higher than that over time, but never larger than 3.7-4MB.
Personally as someone who runs a node I strongly hope it doesn't go above 2MB, that's already pretty big bandwidth wise, and after segwit we at least have the basis for putting more transactions off-chain without resorting to trusted third parties (although lightning technically doesn't require segwit, it is a big help). It will also allow a number of other scalability solutions to start to come in, one being schnorr signatures, although that's complicated to get into.

I notice you used it in Jan 2016; was that a spend from the same Electrum wallet? Is it possible (unlikely but let's check) that you exported the key and used it elsewhere?
A related point is, why are you receiving twice to that address? Electrum doesn't do that by default, it gives you a new receiving address each time.
If on the other hand both spends were entirely from within Electrum, then I don't think weak nonces can be the issue, at least I certainly hope not... (edit: no that's not possible anyway, you'd only spent *from* that address once yourself, the second spend was the thief).
I guess it's possible that either the nonce used for the first spend (Jan 2016) was weak (ie discrete log could be cracked), or the address itself was weak. Both, especially the latter, seem inconceivably unlikely from what I know about Electrum.

You've missed a nuance in the discussion: soft fork vs hard fork. One of the main reasons for the extreme conservatism about block size increases was always the fact that simply bumping max block size is a hard fork, and they require overwhelming consensus and a lot of disruption/preparation in such a large distributed economy/network. Not to say they can't happen, but there needs to be true consensus.
With soft forks it's not quite like that. You still need consensus but it's not as brittle. E.g. 95% of miners and say 50% of users would be fine - the whole point is that the 50% of users who are lazy or who just don't want the new features, don't need to use them, and remain safe.
This is why segwit as a soft fork was considered a breakthrough. It delivers a block size increase in a better way while solidifying the kind of base level of bitcoin, by removing the malleability problem. All without creating the danger of a contentious hard fork splitting the network.
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:02:29

It definitely will be in some cases, not in others. International wires will not beat bitcoin on fees and speed (especially the latter). And the risk of Paypal blocking is very real. But payments between friends, even digitally if in the same jurisdiction, are now and have been easier with things other than Bitcoin pretty much for a long time. Many countries have inter-bank payments in less than a standard Bitcoin block (like Faster Payments in the UK) for basically free. There are tons of options like Paypal and Venmo that are similarly lightweight and even more convenient.
None of that is or ever was the point.
You may have liked the idea of it being the point in 2012 and earlier, because it was basically free, but it was just as slow as now, and the volatility of the value was immense (volatility is lower now, but still somewhat higher than fiat currencies).
Ultimately, Bitcoin is an uncensorable hard money layer. It is SWIFT not Starbucks points. But here's the beautiful thing: if you actually want a *lightweight, fast, basically free* payments system based on that, support the development of Lightning network. It gives that property, without sacrificing trust. The dream of that 'easy transfer no worries' payment is still alive, and it'll actually be better - first because instant, second because volatility will eventually get even lower, unlike with altcoins that are less trustworthy and insanely volatile.
(Even with LN however, *most* consumers *most* of the time do *not* want irreversible transfers for their daily business, especially online - they want trusted third parties that can make sure things don't go wrong. Most people cannot and will not take responsibility for their security and will lose money without a trusted party.)

No, prices are set at the margin. Suppose there was ~ 10% of transactions using segwit, it would make blocks be full far less often, and all other things being equal, fees would drop significantly because of that.


This is just false. It is a theoretical block size maximum around 3-4MB with a practical realistic limit around 1.7-2MB. Yes, of course, that will not all be taken up immediately, but as I've explained above, it doesn't need to be.


Absolutely not the case, as I've explained.
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:07:38


There isn't really a small blocker position, at least not one being actively promoted. Segwit means doubling the blocksize, a very non-trivial increase in capacity, along with making other key technical changes that can enable further scalability improvements. And generally the bitcoin devs are not opposed to further increases in block size, if it's done with sufficient care.
Taking the position that that is more sensible than kicking the can down the road by bumping the blocksize now to a huge number, and simultaneously kicking decentralization under the bus, is not dependent on satellites or something :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:43:09
What's special about Bitcoin's design is that ledger updates are "signed" with work, not by identities. See the brief description of "DMMS" in  .
IMO one of the absolutely fundamental aspects of the system is identitylessness. You can make distributed ledgers in all kinds of fun ways using identities and some basic cryptographic features like digital signatures.

I believe a 30-35% saving will be typical for the p2sh style segwit addresses that'll be in use initially. But certainly nowhere near 75%. (the 4x reduction is for the witness portion only).
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:54:26
I found notable as a commentator here a year or two back, and said so. But I think he's missing the mark in this recent round of politicking.
In a nutshell, what he missed is that **segwit is the compromise**. There are a surprising (to some) number of people that are actually very disturbed by the extent to which **segwit already does increase the blocksize**. It *doubles* the typical max-capacity blocksize, and has the potential to create near 4MB blocks in case anyone sees a value in doing so as an attack. That is very seriously non-trivial.
And the Core developers' position on this is not just arbitrary, they don't come up with numbers like 2MB as 'maybe OK' and 8MB as 'lol, are you joking' just for the hell of it. They actually see the minutiae of network conditions in a way that the rest of just can't. And yes, as he notes, they are mostly not interested in compromise to appease powerful interests, they are interested in keeping Bitcoin something close to what it was intended - trustless and not having a central point of failure - while doing their level best to enable real scaling improvement - things like improving validation and IBD, things like trustless payment channels, things like signature aggregation.

The scriptSig, which is the part of the vin that authorises the spending of that input (that previously unspent transaction output), is empty for a "raw" p2wpkh (pay-to-witness-pubkey-hash) segwit utxo, and is smaller for the more-likely-to-be-used-at-first p2sh/p2wpkh (which wraps a p2wpkh in a p2sh scriptPubkey, so it will have a standard p2sh '3' address), see [here]( What was originally there (in the case of p2pkh, i.e. normal bitcoin utxos corresponding to normal '1' addresses, a signature and a pubkey), is moved into the witness section at the end of the new tx serialization.

Sure both help; I think the "I'm not giving you my bitcoins, you can't have any" argument does miss one aspect: consider that when Bitcoin started, the concentration of wealth was total: only one person had all the coins. Over time, this concentration is slowly reducing; but Bitcoin's gini coefficient is still worse today (although hard to calc. accurately) than even the most corrupt countries on the planet.
It's not the only thing to consider, but it is one thing: if very large holders are paying others for goods and services, it will accelerate the distribution process which has so far been a critical component of success (in the early days, mining, nowadays more speculative trading - so, hopefully, in future, more employment, business and real goods exchange for btc).
Otoh the argument "i see no reason to pay company X via bitpay/coinbase because they just cash out" is completely valid imo.

This is drivel. Look at github, there is a ton of open source code, lightning implementation, sidechains, confidential transactions etc etc. And defensive patents mean nobody can own that stuff.
On the other side you have people like Ver investing heavily in altcoins, buying bitcoin.com to promote his own gambling site and un-vetted wallets, openly bribing miners to try to force a dangerous hard fork on the network, blocking the *actual* scaling improvements (segwit +) that will allow: cheaper usage for users (actual blocksize increase, available now, without dangerous hard fork), and at least attempting to keep bitcoin as software that ordinary people can run and verify for themselves.


at that point (it's paranoid fantasy but I'll go with it for a moment), people will just ignore them and refuse to use their code? Bitcoin is not 'secret', it doesn't even use encryption in any way; what happens on the chain is seen and verified by all (for now! not if mega-blockers have their way, then we just have to trust corporations, hence why not Paypal?). If some set of developers tried to "force" a change that is detrimental to all users it will simply not get used, which is precisely why it's pointless to try in the first place.

My point was exactly that the "AND" was wrong; the first part is clearly true, I'm saying the latter is not (and it can't be, realistically, the inter-block time is nearly fixed).

This is errant nonsense. Segwit *is* a blocksize increase, both literally (how many bytes are sent over the wire), and in the sense that people calling for a block size claimed they cared about: more transaction throughput. It is also a huge step forward in that it fixes technical debt: malleability.

You don't have "a" private key, you have one per address (usually). You can create and use as many addresses as you like, on the fly. Electrum will do this for you. If for any reason you need to access *one* specific private key (for one address), you can do so via "Export", but this is an advanced use case that should be avoided. Treat the seedphrase (words) that you backed up as the start as *the* master private key for your whole wallet, it gives access to all the money in it, because all your private keys can be created from it.
The reason there are lots of addresses and not just one is to improve (considerably!) privacy. If you did all your transactions on just one address, then anyone you send money to or receive money from, could see *all* your Bitcoin transactions, and your current balance, easily, just by looking on the blockchain.
Bitcoin's original design took this into account by making it easy for a user to generate as many addresses (think of them like pseudonyms) as he/she likes, and that's how all modern Bitcoin wallets operate; they generate them on the fly. Note how when you look at the "Receive" tab in Electrum, the address it shows you is different every time (well, that's to say it changes whenever you do a transaction).

It is capped that way; lightning has this weird property that the transactions/second is near infinite, but the number of users is limited. Because you do at some point need to close and open channels, and that requires on-blockchain transactions. 10 billion people can't do that on Bitcoin's blockchain if they need to do it once every few months, even; that would require absolutely huge tx/s throughput on the main chain. Working through the math it's hard to come up with definitive numbers since there's a lot of variables to consider here.

I don't necessarily disagree that China drives the price (that's a hard call to make), but a premium on Chinese exchanges, and especially the CNY price, certainly doesn't prove it in itself; there is also a premium in many other countries.
CNY's non-convertibility muddies the waters considerably too; consider the difference between onshore and offshore rates.

Because it's permissionless; nobody can stop me using a different payment channel. (Presumably you'd open a few). If one node told me "from now on you need to be KYC-ed to use this channel", I'd just close it. You don't have to register with the government to become a node on the LN ...
Oh, prove the "if"? You mean prove "if hubs appear that end up more expensive and require KYC" ? Well I was pointing out that this was a ridiculous claim, not trying to prove it was true.

Sorry but no, on two fronts: 1, they are not a proxy for what the market wants; the system was never designed like that. Their role is to decide on validity in terms of transaction ordering/validity, not to decide on protocol rules. Second, this argument that "because they risk ... they get to decide" is completely wrong. Their business model is to take a calculated risk for return in terms of block rewards. They do not also get to decide how big those block rewards are, how often they arrive or anything similar.
These might have been technical points a few years ago, but they're crucial today, given centralization. We somehow have to convince miners that they don't own the entire network; they are apparently more or less convinced of that now. If they do, then Bitcoin is completely broken - maybe they'll start censoring transactions they don't like next?

@_date: 2016-11-30 10:01:55


The witness is sent over the wire, and as you say, the transaction throughput is increased. In every meaningful sense it is a blocksize increase, and specifically it is what bigger blocks proponents have been asking for - more space for transactions.


This is ridiculous. It's been in testing on *several* different live testnets for a year now.


So you say, but I have heard big block proponents coming to conclusion that figures that high are not safe. And speaking as someone who runs a node, it doesn't sound too appealing to me, bandwidth wise.

These scenarios with a small group of entities make sense until you remember - the only reason a Bitcoin-style blockchain is needed is because entities are not identified and can join and leave at will (and therefore can attack without being caught). With known identities you can simply use a database with digital signatures against fixed pubkeys, and audit trails with hashes. Distributed databases are a known technology. You can have it be append only too if you like (although you don't of course - fudged books would be traceable to the miscreant (who therefore, of course, wouldn't do it anyway), and you could rewind the transactions - databases can do that), you can make up any rules for how to organize your database.
It's only when you need the ledger to be both permissionless and without identity (i.e. anyone can join and leave at will without saying who they are) that you need a real blockchain.
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:21:44


Depends how you look at it, it's a pretty tricky point; a coinjoin that doesn't enforce *any* equal sized outputs is much less attractive, although one should not assume it achieves nothing (even the dumbest conceivable version: Alice input 3btc, Bob input 1 btc, and outputs: 3btc, 1btc could be a payment from Alice to Bob - but I'll let you decide how a blockchain analyst treats it!). 
Coinjoins with very large numbers of participants (which is obviously greatly limited by the feasible size of a bitcoin transaction), which pays no attention to output size, is very likely to be disentanglable through simple arithmetic (see "coinjoin sudoku"), but the (Alice, Bob) caveat above applies even more here.
Allowing unevenness in change outputs, so that the participants all have one equal sized output, but their own change (as we do in Joinmarket) is basically taking a compromise approach, where there is no serious effort to delink the change from the input, but the equal-sized output (the "coinjoin output") is considered to have taken a step towards delinking; with the major caveat that just doing this once has bumped deniability but is unlikely to throw a targeted analysis off the scent (that's why joinmarket has a system of repeated joining through layers, see "tumbler" in JM context).
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:48:33
but what about:


? I know things like faster payments claim irreversibility, but that's just false. Bank accounts get blocked all the time.
Of course, for most use cases, the chances of problems are slim, and the tradeoff heavily favours using a bank. The thing about Bitcoin is, even if the range of scenarios where you want it is small, it offers you something a bank never can (neutrality/uncensorability, or said in a less fancy way, cash payment over the internet).

At the end of the day it's up to people to decide what version of the code they're OK with running. I see less than zero evidence of nefarious behaviour on the part of the &gt; 100 software developers (not a fixed group, just voluntary action of individuals) working on Bitcoin Core, as the reference client for Bitcoin, what I see is a lot of outrageous and delusional nonsense being spouted against them, while they do good work.
As for the extremely technical low level details, feel free to argue about them if you have the competence to do so, but at some point *most* users will have to trust some set of developers.
I honestly am not interested in the opinion of miners, and in fact I've seen evidence of woefully poor understanding of Bitcoin on the part of some big mining pool operators in the past. Well, to qualify, I am somewhat *forced* to take a little interest, and I believe I shouldn't have to. Hence the above.

Well, I expect *probably* uptake of segwit will be faster than P2SH since the latter is more of a trade-off; there are disadvantages (cost) to P2SH, where with segwit cost is an advantage (although variable, initial p2sh/p2wpkh isn't a huge saving iirc). There may be disadvantages to segwit txs, I don't know.
But the point is there's no rush, legacy software'll still work fine as long as it supports sending to p2sh, which they all do.
Bottom line is it makes no sense to complain about adding a new feature which is better than an old one, given that it doesn't break the old one; you were talking about malleability, yes, old txs still have the malleability, I'm not sure how creating a fix that explicitly solves that problem is supposed to be a negative.

I realize this seems obviously correct, but it isn't, not quite. Cash means full and final settlement; in that sense, physical gold is cash, and a SWIFT wire transfer internationally is very cash-like. Those kinds of cash *are* expensive (gold in transport and verification, SWIFT in literal transaction cost), but to the extent people use them, it's precisely for their finality. So Bitcoin can be cash in that sense, although I fully agree that Satoshi's original perspective was much more focused on the retail small-scale concept of cash. That latter perspective cannot scale to the whole world, but with Lightning you can get something pretty close to that vision, because Lightning transactions are bitcoin transactions, they still have the "no counterparty risk" critical element of cash-ness, or at least they come *very* close.

It is a blocksize increase in the only sense that counts - it allows more transactions to be included. I think it is also a literal block size increase, but that is a semantic argument that's not interesting.


That part is absolutely true, and important, because the benefit will not be all at once. However, many wallets and businesses are ready to use it; and those users *not* using it will gain benefit from those who do (because fee pressure will be reduced).

Great to see someone publically pushing this point. I've been saying it for a while too (well, thinking it, occasionally saying it...), but it seems far too few have noticed the role of businesses here. We need to not let them get away with blaming Bitcoin for their problems.
I think we have a case here of some generally good thinkers who just weren't objective enough. Anyone who read the whitepaper and carefully thought about the implications of the model *should* have understood that "Bitcoin is a significant savings cost over traditional legacy money transfer mechanisms" was a dumb position to take. It's subtle, clearly it *was* and to some extent still is, far cheaper than the most expensive forms of money transfer across borders - it's in cross border transfer that it particularly shines of course - but that absolutely was not the point. If you bought into Bitcoin because it was cheap or free to transact, then you completely failed to grok what's going on here. And I think that some very smart entrepreneurs kind of "fuzzed" this point in their brains because "cheap money transfer" was so attractive and such a huge selling point in sales meetings.
As for *actual* super-cheap transfers, we actually have a solution for that now that makes sense, although it won't be live for a while, but I guess these companies were mostly started before we even knew that Lightning was possible.

No, it's an advantage of using a bank vs using cash. Bitcoin is digital cash: no counterparty risk, and risk of irretrievable loss (whether through violent robbery or accident) - these are 2 sides of the same coin. They are the nature of cash, or bearer instruments.

How is a soft fork not a better solution than a hard fork, in your opinion?
It has no negative impact on those that don't upgrade (see e.g. CSV last year, a soft fork: don't use CSV? no need to care).
In this case there is actually a positive impact even on those who don't upgrade: because the pressure on fees is likely to reduce significantly even with very moderate uptake.

There are trade offs with everything, but let me explain why trusting Coinbase with Bitcoin is *not* the same as trusting a bank with dollars:
Suppose 5 people are needed to access the funds, within Coinbase, e.g. the CEO, the lead engineer, 3 others, whatever. Suppose one day they wake up and decide to be evil and move all the Bitcoin to some private account of theirs, and perhaps make up a story in the press about how they've been "hacked". You have a serious problem, as you might find there is a protracted legal battle (see MtGox), but you can't actually retrieve the funds unless in some way the company is re-stocked with Bitcoin, or perhaps an equivalent in fiat.
If on the other hand you controlled the funds with a majority of keys in a multisig, then it would always effectively be your bitcoin. But it also means that if you get hacked, you lose.
Now, if your bank gets hacked similarly - 5 key operatives in the bank decide to swipe your money and pretend it was external hackers - SWIFT transfers are made to accounts in Russia and China; here it will always ultimately be at the discretion of legal agencies whether you "actually" still have the money that is stolen. Because dollars are not real, they can be created at a whim, and while reversing international transfers is not *quite* so simple, very often that reversal can be achieved (e.g. recent SWIFT hank at bangladesh bank; $1 billion stolen, all but $80 million "recovered" (just means wire transfers reversed)). Added to that consider insurance, so even when transfers can't be reversed, the money can be "found". If too many banks get hacked all at once the Federal Reserve and the govt together can make up some "fund" that magically reassigns balances any time they like, with sufficient political will (that's essentially what was happening in 2008 TARP etc).
So far no insurance company has ever paid out on a Bitcoin company's claim. Worth considering also.
You might say, since it's risky both ways, why not trust Coinbase? Aren't they more competent in security than me?
Almost certainly, but this argument has two massive holes in it: (1) because they *concentrate* funds they are a massive target for hackers, while you are not - at all. (2) they are a *trusted third party* so the situation is strictly worse - not only do you have to trust their security skills, but you also have to trust them not to steal (modulo multisig, as mentioned above) (edited to add: as well as literal stealing, there is things like political confiscation, don't forget).

I'm overwhelmed trying to do other things, e.g. running tests on multiple message channels (it's working well right now).
I'm happy to see this initiative, I wonder whether giving it a separate name is a bit confusing, it's not really a separate project right now, more an extension.

I've often thought an inventive way to sell Bitcoin would be as "change" for overpriced retail items. Similar thought I guess. As to legality ... well. And if you tried to do this as a way for people to buy Bitcoin surreptitiously, you have the obvious problem that you somehow have to advertise to people that you're doing this, which means Mr TLA agent finds out.

It's quite frustrating that even those who are trying to help support the adoption of segwit make statements that are giving a factually wrong, negative impression of it. In this episode, Gabriel D Vine says


That is not true - wallets which know nothing about segwit will be unaffected and will still be able to send to wallets that use it, because the addresses, for now, will just be p2sh ('3') as already understood by every single wallet. For more detail, see the section "Wallets-&gt;Not upgrading" [here](
It's hard enough trying to correct the endless torrent of outright lies by antagonists, please make sure you have the basic facts right!
From paying attention to a broad range of "bitcoin media" I can tell you that what is needed is not cheerleading Core (that's what you guys tend to lapse towards), but just establishing *basic* facts, like the fact that it **is a blocksize increase** (this needs to be repeated everywhere it's discussed, because believe me, the message is *not* understood - just one example, see the youtube show "the Filter" from the bitcoins in bali group, where the speaker on successive shows has presented the "blocksize debate" as : (1) increase the blocksize (hard fork but no worries, that's "clean", it's "just one line of code!") or (2) "do segwit (which is really complicated!) so we can have lightning"  (tacit assumption blocksize does not increase) - this is the kind of appalling mischaracterisation that has fully embedded itself into the consciousness of the not-really-paying-attention general Bitcoin public).
Forget the crazies and those with an utter lack of humility that are quite sure that (a) Core is evil (despite the fact it's not a thing and doesn't control anyone) and (b)segwit is "too complicated" and "centralizes to give profits to Blockstream" or some other incoherent drivel; those people are beyond hope. But please clearly present the facts so the open minded can understand!

I would be more inclined to take this position *if* Lightning or similar were properly workable without segwit. I still don't know enough about this, but what I've heard is that it's basically possible but much more kludgy; and given how complicated such a system has to be, that's bad. It's not like Lightning is some guaranteed panacea for all ills, but in the absence of something *like* that, Bitcoin can never scale up to being a system of global significance. No amount of huge block fantasising can change that.
The other reason I can't quite take this position is segwit is a fix to a quite *fundamental* design flaw.

This is absolutely true but also it's not very common at all. It can only happen during brief periods when demand for block space suddenly ramps up.

I hope we don't get any huge new vectors of usage (*especially* consumer usage) without segwit (and even that is only giving us a *small* bump in potential throughput, so let's not go crazy).

Categorically false. A single parameter in the code is not updated from 1MB, but the allowed size of a block *is* increased. The link shown by BashCo makes totally unambiguous - they are actual testnet 3.7MB sized blocks.

This is a category error. Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin was never competing with VISA. It competes (if with anything) with the two extremes of the financial system: the "top" (central bank monopoly on money creation) and "bottom" (peer to peer cash payments, extended from in-person to over a network). It's not a consumer payments system; if we want that it will have to be built *on top* of Bitcoin.

You still don't get it. It *is* a block size increase. Both the size of the block passed over the network, and the number of transactions increase. 
(It's only in a specific accounting sense, that has no relevance to the issue of transaction throughput, that there is still a "base" blocksize which is not increased).
There have been blocks of size 3.7MB already mined on testnet, where segwit is already active. The question you've asked in this thread is ill-formed.

I appreciate the elucidation on third-party malleability. I find myself wondering whether we can't make a fairly simple, graspable for the non-tech literate, explanation of how segwit fixes malleability and how it's the clearly sane and correct solution to the problem. I'm imagining like some kind of animation that shows the signatures as coloured boxes or something (show authorisation somehow?) inside another box (the tx), and "fingerprints" (txid), so you can clearly see that if you can create new sigs, the fingerprints are umm.. smudged :) And like, extracting the box from the bigger box means the fingerprint is fixed, unalterable.
At least those prepared to listen to reason might be able to see that this is not a "hack", but rather a fix to a design flaw.

I also always do it this way, I think it's the best practical approach. It's the easiest for the eye, and just checking the first chunk is not (completely) safe. 
(The fact that the checksum is encoded at the end helps too because it's coming out of a different hash, so if someone was throwing computational power at an attack, to trick you with a partial collision, it makes their job harder, I think).

The question in the title is answered simply: node operators, individually, will never be valued by *others* as they can be Sybiled, and that can only be removed at the expense of identity, which kills the whole point of the system.
The primary value of running a node will always be your own security and privacy.

I get that point of view, but I *do* think that many people pushing a big block agenda are *strongly* motivated by the fact that they look at Bitcoin from a business perspective (not always directly about the profitability of their *own* business, although it's sometimes that too); they are hugely committed to a vision of a rapidly, hugely growing Bitcoin. Without very cheap transactions, a lot of business models are broken. That is *sometimes* combined with a lack of deeper technical understanding, but more to the point it's combined with a lack of commitment to what *really* matters about Bitcoin - its independent verifiability. That is not a given, it will only be maintained by somehow extricating it from human decision making, which is going to continue to be extremely tough. The idea of it being "democratic" or "community driven" is really poor thinking; it will succeed as a form of money precisely to the extent that it is *not* about community.
I also strongly dislike some of Ver's actions, most notably taking control of bitcoin.com and using it to push his agenda, that I find despicable (Bitcoin is an open source software project and it should be respected as such). But at that point this becomes a descent into politics and I don't think anything good is going to come of that...

The worst you could have is 18 inputs to your transaction (that would not normally be the case, unless you've received 18 separate payments and now want to spend them all), that would result in ~ 3kB of transaction which should be around 210k satoshis at 70k sat/kB (see e.g.  (NB very rough estimates here, there are some details that can change it a fair amount). Current exchange rates puts that fee at $1.89.
Typically transactions use 1-3 inputs which would be therefore around 9 times lower than that. So a more normal transaction costs ~ 20c as of right now.
As you can see, bitcoin transactions are not economical for payments &lt; $1 right now, and can be reasonable in the $1-$10 depending on circumstances; whereas above about $50-$100 the fees are fine (they stay in that ~10-30c range no matter the monetary value, although of course the dollar cost does vary with factors like the dollar-btc exchange rate and how busy the network is).
Fees could reduce significantly if and when segwit activates, because it will allow larger blocks each 10 minutes, so there'll be less competition for space. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 08:41:23


That is completely unworkable, surely?! (in particular the bolded part). The stickiness of protocols is very extreme, you can't go around changing it every now and then, because by definition, by design the "community" of Bitcoiners is amorphous and made up of anonymous participants. We can't make decisions as a "community" except with extremely long lag times and a lot of effort.
How is this a market? Are we setting prices for different block sizes? How do I express my preference for 4-5MB blocks instead of 2-3 MB blocks as a user? My tx fee doesn't signal it. Writing about it on reddit or something, see my previous paragraph.
See, the main economic/market forces at play in Bitcoin are for the miners; they are the ones who stand to make 10s to 100s of k every day, and therefore they are also the ones who have to put 10s-100s k at risk (free markets being what they are, there is no easy money). This is what you should focus on, and I see no evidence to suggest that miners are bound to find an equilibrium block size that will make the system as a whole work well, I can *easily* imagine quite the opposite, where the economic incentives would push a miner to, for example, make a huge block of 20MB, which due to propagation delay, gives them an overwhelming advantage in finding the next block.
It doesn't matter whether my example above is poorly conceived, the problem is that this is very difficult analysis that needs to be done by experts, there is no market principle that magically guarantees that the system is not unstable in a way like the above. Those of us who are not able to spend the time to do this in-detail analysis, in particular to analyse the ways the system is fragile and subject to attack, should not think that our armchair analysis is of any consequence. Just because something "feels" right, that's not enough, and no more is doing a few hours of webpage reading enough to have a considered opinion.


Begging the question; the question at hand is whether a simple block size increase is workable and not dangerous. The question is not whether it would be nice to have bigger blocks *if* there were no negative side effects.

Yes it is, (a) because Lightning transactions are bitcoin transactions and (b) because of the timeout clauses, it has the crucial property that you do not lose money if the counterparty reneges. It's the absence of counterparty risk that defines it as cash/bearer instrument.

This comes out of the fact that Bitcoin is a consensus system. People need to stop getting upset that their ideas aren't given airtime, developer cognitive bandwidth is supremely limited. It's not Linux where you can just spin up your own distro if Linus doesn't like your idea. People are *trying* to do that, and that's fine, no one can stop them, *if* you build a compatible version. That's *incredibly* restrictive, it's just the nature of the beast. Of course it's daunting to try to get consensus to add your ideas to this! How could it be anything else?
Far too many people just got so upset that their ideas weren't taken on. This isn't about ego.
The worst to me are companies that complain about this stuff, but offer no help to the open source development community that's actually making the system work. Then they have the cheek to complain about it. Bitcoin doesn't belong to you just because you have a smart suit and are "important". It also doesn't owe you exponential growth just because that suits your business model.

Not if you use Bitcoin sensibly (don't reuse addresses for a start). Heck, even a completely thoughtless user is pretty unlikely to make it obvious what their entire balance is, and more to the point, there will be a big chunk of uncertainty about what they own.
It's less directly applicable today but consider this case (true story): I sent a retail payment, I forget maybe $25 or $50, to a company using Joinmarket and noticed that one of the inputs was worth ~ $250k :) Note how, if someone looking at that did not know that coinjoin was even possible (i.e. they thought that all inputs must come from the same person), they would "conclude" that I had a ton of money (they might give me preferential business treatment! or they might try to rob me, if it was in person).
All the same your point is valid in the most general sense - you could easily end up exposing information about what other coins you own.

Possibly, but I think the real concern is random and intermittent huge spikes like we saw this week (which is unlikely to be normal economic activity, but I don't intend to speculate on whether it's an "attack", that won't make any difference). Not so much gradual, organic growth, which will simply be throttled by fees, it won't cause this kind of user experience (my wallet estimated a priority fee but it quickly became too low).

Here is a summary of what actually happened, as described on IRC by gmaxwell:
Dec 19 01:50:25 &lt;gmaxwell&gt;      some people went on their own to meet with miners in china. They were kept until something like 3am in a conference room until they agreed on their own to work on some hardfork designs if miners the participating miners didn't run classic.  **Within a week F2Pool began signaling classic, breaking their agreement, and yet the couple developers there still did what they said they would do and posted a design

A couple people who aren't even among the most involved, said clearly they'd work on their own time on a proposal, which they did. They had no power or authority to obligate Bitcoin Core to anything, nor does Bitcoin Core have any power or authority t
Dec 19 01:50:37 &lt;gmaxwell&gt;      o promise a hardfork. What they did say they would do, they did-- even though the miners breached their side of the agreement.
(emphasis mine).
Addressing your last paragraph:


This is just incoherent. The code is shipped, it's called segwit, and it's a block size increase to ~ 2MB along with a bunch of other hugely beneficial improvements.
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:30:17


No, not really, I know anti-segwit people like to pretend that's true, but it's highly misleading. 70% is the very low end of current estimates of what the effective maximum block size will be with current transaction mixes. Of course initially, whether it's 70% or 130% is academic; tx rates won't suddenly jump by that much, it'll take time.
And over time, people will start to use more and more the more effcient transaction types that gain the most from segwit, such that the "effective maximum block size" will increase further. It'll never get above around 3.7-4MB, but it can certainly go up beyond say 2-2.5MB over time.
So "segwit is only a 70% maximum block size increase and that's that" is just false.
I leave it undiscussed whether 3+MB blocks are actually a good thing.

I was thinking about whether some system of user-editable tests might help.
But tests aren't enough: consider the examples of people writing altcoins with heavily obfuscated backdoors so that when exchanges run their code, they get access to the exchange's database and steal all the coins. This has actually [happened](
Tests couldn't find backdoors like that. It's hard to have tests that even do the job of verifying honest work: asserting fully correct action in anticipated modes. It's nearly impossible to have tests test actions that are deliberately hidden. I guess tests can verify "isolation" of sensitive material in some particular imagined architecture, but .. don't ask me to figure it out :) Some kind of formally verifiable software, assuming your hardware is not backdoored, but it seems way out there.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:42:20


Segwit is an on-chain blocksize increase to ~2MB. So that makes zero sense. Also the whole argument makes zero sense in the context that when block size does increase, via whatever mechanism, the fees per tx go down. So how does "block size increase protect their interests in the face of halving"?
If you're saying that their actual argument is that they want to cripple Bitcoin by preventing users *voluntarily* choosing to use payment channels (which by the way are already possible today, albeit segwit helps a lot), then, seriously? This is something we should accept as an argument?
What's even more ridiculous is, it is completely short sighted to actually believe that the value of received rewards as a miner will be lower in an environment where segwit is activated; in that scenario, over time, if LN and similar get rolled out, the use cases for Bitcoin increase, not decrease, the fees go down - exactly what people are hoping for, this will increase adoption and doubtless price, making the rewards more valuable. And if it doesn't, because LN doesn't take off, then there is no issue of cramped space, which people are claiming is the problem.

If you've heard of bitcoin tumblers as currently exist, you probably know that the idea is: you send coins, you pay a fee, a little while later (or perhaps very quickly, sticky point), you get the coins back minus a fee, but in entirely disconnected addresses.
Nobody really *wants* to do that, because it means giving your coins to some guy running some server out there (often a Tor hidden service for obvious reasons), meaning you trust them with *all* of the money, you pay them a fee (I don't know current market rates but I think I've heard of 1-2% being typically, maybe it's lower nowadays), and even if that wasn't enough, *they* know the linkages and so they *might* keep track of them.
Tumblebit in classic tumbler mode is similar, but with all those drawbacks removed: you connect to the server, pay in, wait for a while, then receive coins back that are not connected, but there is no possibility for the server to steal the coins, and the server doesn't know which output coins are connected with which input coins.
There are limitations: (1) a single "run"/epoch needs to have everyone send in the same amount of coins (2) the coins are only "disconnected" within the anonymity set of the run; so if you were the only one participating, it would be close to pointless since it'd be easy to figure out the input and output transactions and see the flow. The nice thing about the design is, even though bitcoin tx sizes are limited, you can arrange to have many hundreds of inputs and outputs (a test run of 800 inputs/outputs has been done), which could all be from different people. It's not hard to see that doing this a few times in sequence could create enormous combinatorial blowup in possible input-output connections.
You can put caveats and limitations on pretty much everything I said here, but that's the basic idea.


Sure, it's possible, although it's a little way off. A server based model has pluses (it's quite a bit easier to get software up and running in that model vs peer to peer) and minuses (security issues, holding collateral).
The server has to have enough coins to service the transactions, even though it doesn't ever control your coins. So if there's 100 users each wanting to do 1BTC, you need at least 100BTC on-hand. Holding large amounts of live coin on a server is a by now a famously hard security problem.
The other usability problem that needs consideration is network level anonymity. If you as user A use a simple http(s) connection to do both "sides" of the transaction, then the tumblebit server can easily see who's doing the same input and output, so the blinding magic that disconnects them is rendered moot, I believe. I haven't thought this through in detail, I was vaguely assuming that Tor usage was the right solution to that, but if so, obviously that's another usability hurdle. Perhaps I'm missing something there.

I don't get what you mean, a schnorr sig against a single pubkey is clearly not a ring signature? And the feature that's most desirable under discussion here, aggregation of schnorr for space-saving, is not a ring signature, it's just an M of M multisig. You can use the AOS design to build a ring sig out of schnorr sigs, I guess in other ways too, not sure.


I'm actually even more confused about this part, clearly not all ring signatures are using zksnarks, monero's ring sigs don't. and "closer to Monero than even Monero itself"?

Only read about half so far, but several times the author has made a quite fundamental mistake; Bitcoin "wastes" energy, not storage space; the latter is a fairly minor issue in blockchains generally; there are even designs out there at the edge like Mimblewimble where by sufficiently clever use of cryptography you can collapse the required storage to the order of a few megabytes forever. And even before that, it's possible to use pruning to greatly reduce storage requirements for live running.
The scaling issues are principally around bandwidth and CPU, and to an extent RAM; storage is not really that big of a deal. From an individual user's perspective, rather than a miner, the "waste" is more on those resources, but that is not an interesting feature of blockchains; things like Netflix and Bittorrent "waste" bandwidth too. What's different here is the energy resource usage (mining). So the thesis of what I've read so far is just wrong in my opinion.

This argument is dead wrong, although popular. If you murder someone, you are the criminal, not the money. If you are prosecuted then of course the money will be taken off you. The person who paid you is also a criminal (IANAL but basically) and can likewise be prosecuted. But this is *prosecuting the money*, a subtle but crucial difference.
"money laundering" is about attacking money's essential property of fungibility. If the murderer buys a suit from the local tailor, that money is now "proceeds of crime" according to money laundering. There are legal precedents going back hundreds of years to prevent this "attaching the crime to the money", for very good reason: it cripples commerce and removes the unconditional ownership of money, since at any time it can be confiscated; the money is effectively "guilty until proven innocent" in our dystopian "KYC/AML" world.
This is not conspiracy theory bullshit, it's not about there being some hidden elite controlling everything - it's that the bureaucracy of the state gains advantage in a world where you don't have to do normal police work but can simply confiscate money and force people to do your will. Less individual liberty makes for much stronger overall control; so things like sanctions or drug wars can be prosecuted more effectively, just like dropping a nuke is more effective than going house to house to find the actual combatants.

Don't have a strong opinion on the general question of this thread, but on this point: by definition currency is centralization; it's a hub and spoke design to solve what is sometimes pretentiously called the "double coincidence of wants" problem of barter.
You seem to have conflated that kind of architectural centralization with the issue of control/trust. Fiat means by decree, i.e. some central authority has control, that's not at issue here.
I think the reality is you always end up getting some kind of power law distribution, one dominant, a few semi-serious competitors, a lot of tiny also-rans. Even in currencies, where the network effects are particularly sticky, a monopoly doesn't dominate forever. Bitcoin could certainly be overtaken by another cryptocurrency, or it could morph so much that it's really a new thing, but both would take considerable time imo (short of a catastrophe).

To amplify the other responses (i.e. that it's transaction malleability), here's why that matters: for 2 parties to pre-agree a transaction which spends outputs which haven't yet been committed to the blockchain requires that the transaction id of the yet-to-be-committed transaction is fixed by its (inputs, outputs). If the transaction id can change between the time it's signed, and the time it gets committed into the blockchain, then any transaction spending *out* of it can be invalidated.

It's actually worse than that; with transfers from the address you withdraw to, they usually can only *infer* ownership, they cannot deduce it. This is especially true because coinjoin is *possible*, not necessarily that it actually happened (in other words, it is not safe to assume common ownership of all inputs). Blockchain analysis has been partially based on making that unsafe assumption, it would be interesting to find out what algorithms are being used. But in any case, the fundamental point holds - they are allowed to terminate accounts at any time, but they *should* not be allowed to confiscate funds, that's the part that particularly interests me.
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:46:41
AFAIK non-interactive coinjoin means OWAS/Mimblewimble. Schnorr aggregation means coinjoin with smaller footprint (which is what you're interested in), but schnorr aggregation is interactive, so coinjoin with it retains the requirement for interaction (as with ordinary coinjoin as today).
So I guess what says; it needs cooperation.

Well, in the limit, zero fees means unlimited block size (unless we propose another mechanism to filter allowable transactions, hard to see that without trivial DOS), means impractical for anyone to run nodes (I'm completely ignoring whether huge blocks cause other horrible security problems, which presumably they do), means that users cannot participate trustlessly in the network.

0-cost fees were never a "fundamental attribute"; just because some idiots back in the day thought it was a "big selling point" for Bitcoin doesn't mean it ever made a lick of sense. *On-chain* transactions cannot be free (except by dumb luck) for simple DOS reasons.

What you mean is "impossible to actually sell fiat".
Yeah I know it's a ridiculous Bitcoiner thing to say, but it's more true than not. Consider this logic: if I want to sell altcoins for bitcoins, I have no such problem. I can do this without ID in many places. If I want to sell fiat for bitcoins, I do.

That perspective (which is extremely common) misses the deeper view: cash *is* settlement, and the irreversibility of blockchain level payments along with its inability to scale through orders of magnitude makes it profoundly unsuitable to be used, on its own, as a *consumer payments network*. There's a reason we don't make web payments with bundles of $10 bills in envelopes, and it's not *only* that it's slower. This is why back when everyone was rah-rah about paying for coffees and beers in bars with smartphones (think 2013), I was always saying "nah that's not it at all".
What changed since 2013 is simple - LN. It means there is a *possible* choice for consumer payments which isn't pure legacy style (which things like Coinbase offer, and *definitely* have a lot of advantages - Joe sixpack is used to trusted third parties), but one which is basically trustless. Now that only addresses *one* of the two drawbacks I mentioned above - it allows scaling tx/s through many orders of magnitudes (although not users). It *doesn't* change that you're transferring cash, not a credit with a TTP. So the proof of the pudding is in the eating, but it's at least potentially an incredible development.

He's absolutely right. It's entirely impossible for a hard fork to be rolled out in any non-very-long timeframe (in fact it's both dangerous and difficult, because like it or not, many people are vehemently opposed to hardforks). So supporting bigger blocks in a reasonable timeframe means segwit or nothing.

On your overall thesis, point well taken, but I'm not sure I agree that it can be boiled down to just "dedication"; it's some kind of combination of discipline, talent, vision, dedication and even ethics. To get pretentious for a minute, I think it's best summarised with "wisdom". 
A lot of people have dedication but don't know what to dedicate themselves to for their and others' actual benefit.

Segwit does increase the blocksize. That's what people claim to want. The other advantages it offers are considerable, and every argument against it I've seen has been full of appallingly bad misunderstanding.
The only *logical* reasons to be against it are
(a)  you really want blocks to stay &lt;1MB
(b) you want to retard the development of Lightning network tech. (which is trustless and peer to peer, not centralized and trust-requiring as is being constantly blatantly lied)
(c)  you think (rightly or wrongly, probably wrongly) that as a miner your tx fee income is going to go down if segwit is implemented.

You cannot prune the txo set because you don't know which coins have been spent. I've never really looked into this technically, but at a high level that's a pretty serious scalability problem; perhaps it can be solved somehow.
CT's rangeproofs (bulletproofs ameliorates but doesn't remove) have a "scale" but not "scaling" problem, they bloat the size of txs by a big factor. Aggregation with BPs is possible, as is batch verification, which ameliorates.

This is a fund for investing in shitcoins with the purpose of selling them to greater fools (of which there are many). It seems very clear. Fred Wilson (the Union Square Venture guy) and several others of this set of people were singing the praises of Steemit a short while ago, I kid you not. (in case you're not in the loop, within a month or two it had fallen like 90%, entirely appropriate since it's basically a scam).
It's notable that many of these same people followed the path trodden by people like Voorhees, too: they start out expressing how "passionate" they are about how Bitcoin can change the world, and how it challenges the existing financial order, then when they notice there's more money to be made from selling snake oil to inveterate gamblers and dummies dumb enough to actually believe the sales pitches, they change their tune. Because actually they don't give a shit about principles, they only care about making money and/or impressing their peers.

I don't believe the way the routing is designed (p2p), that this will be the case.


This is the tacit assumption I always see, that I believe is wrong: the hidden assumption here is that it is *possible* for transactions to ramp up to much higher volume on-chain, without disastrous side effects. *If* that's correct, then the decision whether to use LN or main chain is different; the trade off then would be about time mostly.


I don't think we have anything like a market for block sizes (perhaps in some obtuse sense with different cryptocurrencies? well a bit of a stretch). But my response here is more or less as above, you're assuming the system is stable and not e.g. susceptible to some serious attack by miners with much larger block sizes. I haven't studied that stuff, but all the people I take seriously who I know have studied it, have advised extreme caution. All I know at the user level is, a somewhat larger block size wouldn't affect me much (a bit more bandwidth and disk space), while a much larger block size certainly would; but I don't leap from that to the conclusion that the system is going to work fine with say 4MB blocks, I don't know. What I do know is that huge optimizations have been done on the system over the last few years - a notable example being a 7x speedup (something like that) in ecdsa verification from libsecp256k1 - and it may well be that the system might already have experienced serious failures due to a large increase in transaction volume, had that not been done. Unless you are in the trenches coding Bitcoin, you don't really know what is and isn't safe. I code for a project that uses Bitcoin, and use it every day, so I'm close enough to have a vague sense that we must be cautious in terms of scale. Segwit seems like a good compromise with roughly 2MB in the near-ish term, without a hard fork. Some devs are even worried about that much increase.

No, not guaranteed, not even close; a lot of people consider cash as one sensible way to store savings, which might not make sense to you, but it's conditional on  your view of banks.
For example, personally, I would prefer to avoid all bank usage if my purpose is only storage, because I have counterparty risk, plus I have problems with the way the banking system works, and would *prefer* to avoid using it if possible. On the other hand, storing all savings in Bitcoin is way too risky (and impractical). That I don't just use only cash for savings is for the obvious reasons: (1) it's not very safe (2) there are some payments that are hard to make in cash or Bitcoin.

It's true that this role is very sticky, but it's not 100% sticky. Example: if miners started censoring transactions in a systematic way, at the behest of government requests, they would be fired by the userbase in a matter of weeks or months maximum.
But unless you have that kind of truly overwhelming consensus against them, it is hard for the userbase to organize well enough to switch. It would have to be a different PoW algo realistically, which doesn't help. Although not 100% sure on technical details there.

Bitcoin's transaction sighashing design is indeed technical debt; a design in which what you sign includes authorization data is fundamentally broken. That's what segwit was created for ('witness' in this context is a known term in cryptography, referring to the data whose function is to authorize other data). Separating it is the right way to fix this design flaw.
Yes, I know pointing this out doesn't fit with the "segwit is technical debt" talking point that people are parrotting, but that talking point nonsense, so no problem there.

Your diagram is *kinda* correct; but witnessdata1 is inside transaction1 (perhaps the distinction doesn't matter), the serialization of each tx is roughly:
&lt;version+swflags&gt;&lt;numins&gt;&lt;inputs, each of which contains utxo reference, sequence number and scriptsig&gt;&lt;num outs&gt;&lt;outs&gt;&lt;witnesses,1 per input&gt;&lt;locktime&gt;
(missing various details ... but you can look up more if you want to).
note that that serialization is ONLY used for transactions that have at least one input of segwit type, otherwise it falls back to the previous serialization format, which is basically the same except there is no witness section and the swflags are not there.
Your teacher is categorically and completely wrong. There is no 1MB limit and blocks are regularly above 2MB (though average around 1.3MB during relatively busy times). The limit is 4M weight, with witness bytes counting 1 weight and non-witness counting 4, basically.
This is someone "teaching bitcoin"?! ... segwit was first in development more than 3 years ago, and active on the live network for more than 2; what kind of "bitcoin teacher" not only doesn't know this, but doesn't bother to research and actively tells you something the opposite of the truth?

That argument is so patently obviously wrong it's comical: if hubs appear that end up more expensive and require KYC, then quite obviously people will use other hubs that are less expensive and don't require KYC.

If fees are zero there is literally *nothing* stopping a script kiddie, let alone professional antagonists, sending millions upon millions of transactions onto the network.
There used to be a priority weighting that would allow free or much-less-fee-than-normal transactions to clear if the utxo age + size combination was high enough. This doesn't allow trivial DOS attacks, albeit it might only apply to relatively larger transactions. I'm not sure why that's gone away, except perhaps simply because miners want to maximize their fee income.

Absolutely wrong to say that it's "embarrassingly easy"; for non-devs it'll probably be impossible to trigger it by accidental actions (even today I don't know how to do it with lnd, and I even contributed to the project (a tiny PR, but to give you a sense)). But it's clearly a very important point that it is *possible* for this to happen, especially via some very unlucky bug.
Don't forget eltoo might end up being adopted and avoids this problem.


You already correctly qualified "fully anonymous" to "pseudonymous" for BTC, for LN though, it's absolutely valid to say that, for coins moving on LN, the general privacy/fungibility is considerably increased, at least in a world where LN is fairly widely used. Not perfectly anonymous, but much more nearly anonymous. And that's likely to improve, too.

Carrying money across borders without having anything representing it either physically or digitally is one (common misconception is bitcoins are "stored on computers").
Bitcoin doesn't need the internet; just a broadcast medium. Radios would work.
Another one is a machine starting its own business, e.g. imagine an AI that made digital artworks and sold them and then varied its algorithms based on feedback. Or self-driving cars as taxis where the car itself was its own boss, using Bitcoin payments to fund its upkeep.

"exclusion" is completely false, in fact the opposite of the truth, see 
They never offered any help or even arguments/input to the development process. And "gridlock" is either stupendous ignorance or lies, there is more development going on now than ever. What they really mean is they're not having Bitcoin bend to their will into the form that gives them the most potential profit (which is a gradual slide into a Paypal model).
To be clear, I'm not accusing these companies of anything like incompetence; they were (or seemed to be) trying to find a way to be "on-ramps" into what they thought Bitcoin was, i.e. just another technology like the others SV works with, where somehow "magically" it solved the regulatory problems that had beset earlier efforts to get their software disruption model to work in finance. But their understanding seems to have been weak, mixed with a bunch of wishful thinking. Bitcoin solves that problem only by making some very hard decisions (PoW, decentralization) which means that it never fit into their model. Now those guys are mostly interested in pumping altcoins (at least until the regulators show up), or just getting out of cryptocurrency generally.

Here's my serious answer: nothing has *intrinsic* value, but people might assign value to something due to it having useful properties. Gold had certain useful properties: malleability, resistance to corrosion, which when *combined* with scarcity made it useful for jewellery and then currency.
Bitcoin is similar and different: it has a very unusual property, compared to other commodities: it can be transferred without any censorship or blocking, at the speed of light, around the world, no matter the amount/value (try taking $10 million worth of gold across national borders, not impossible, not easy though), and *combined* with its scarcity (its very unusual design is what creates this, even though it's digital), makes it useful as a currency (and conceivably for other application, but big topic).
Satoshi Nakamoto once tried to sum this up with an analogy: imagine if you had a metal that could be transported over a telephone line; then, even if it was dull and not useful like gold is, it might still "gain currency", because that single very unusual property of being digitally communicatable could be very useful.

Since this is open source software, it is literally impossible to develop a tech for Bitcoin that cannot be re-applied to an altcoin. So it's absurd to make this argument. Are they *actually* developing or investing in altcoins (Ver is doing the latter, so are most of the other famous names in the "cryptocurrency space")? No.
Are they developing tech (or at least trying to!) that makes innovation with altcoins less interesting/compelling because you can do innovation more easily using Bitcoin itself? Yes.

The Gini coefficient of Bitcoin started at 1.0 in 2009 and has been constantly trending downwards ever since. The Gini coefficient of fiat currencies in places like US are trending upwards.
According to me, in the long term, PoW is important for keeping this downward rather than upward trend: with PoW nobody gets to receive either seignorage or transaction fees as a matter of *right*; they have to expend resources to receive them.

Overall, it's a very good and reasonably concise answer.
Unfortunate that right at the start he writes "like any other fiat currency"; that's a misunderstanding of the term "fiat" which basically means "by decree/by order"; it applies to unbacked govt currencies but cannot applied to Bitcoin. But tbh that doesn't matter.
He gets the main thing right, which most people don't: value comes from having distinct properties (don't waste time arguing about "intrinsic" vs 'relative" value, that's interesting philosophically but adds nothing to the discussion of Bitcoin vs other currencies). Gold did not become a currency just because a bunch of people said so, or because of a slick marketing campaign, or because of a network effect, but because it had certain properties which were conducive, and the network effect followed after.
The same is true of Bitcoin. It has properties, in particular having an uncensorable (modulo network power) transfer of ownership mechanism. So e.g. the fact that there are only 21m coins would be of no interest if you couldn't pay Wikileaks with it because you got censored. That was the killer app of Bitcoin that kicked it all off, that's its "intrinsic" value.

Sending the tweak \`k\` (it's \`c\` in the draft) under an encryption derived via ECDH (ECIES is the standard way to do this) enables the proposer to propose a destination address for the receiver without revealing that information to the world at large (which would defeat the purpose of coinjoin), and without directly talking to the receiver.

1. It's open source.
2. There are currently about 5 or 6 different implementations, with nothing stopping anyone making more. Look at the list of implementors [here]( - listed are ACINQ, Amiko Pay, Bcoin/Purse.io, Bitfury, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs.
3. It's permissionless, like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, it does not require a global consensus meaning that centralization pressures are less.
4. Dynamic routing means you are not stuck to one "hub" (lightning is p2p, not hub and spoke). You can connect to several peers, and if one of the peers you're connected to behaves in a way you don't like, you can stop using them.
5. It's trustless, and it's Bitcoin. You are doing actual Bitcoin transactions, just selectively not broadcasting some of them. At no point are you trusting counterparties to hold money for you and not run away with it.
There is no "the Core", i.e. "Bitcoin Core" is just a name for the software, it's not "the" as in a defined, controlled group. Bitcoin is open source and anyone is welcome to contribute. It's tough to get new changes added to Bitcoin because it requires a global consensus. As I mentioned above, that's not true with Lightning; the same reason it's a superior scaling model, it's not global broadcast, but more like the internet, it's point to point. People can make up a new payment channels technology not called "Lightning" but called something else; no one can stop them.
There's a good summary under 'Key features' [here](
There are real questions to be asked I think about how difficult it will be to create software that people can easily use. But those are not the questions being asked; indeed the anti-Lightning crowd are not asking questions at all, just spouting ignorant nonsense, with very few exceptions.
As for the arguments as to why Lightning network is evil both because it will take all the transactions off chain, *and* it's evil because it will explode demand for transactions on-chain, no comment, I've read enough stupid for one day.

The size of a transaction in bytes depends mostly on the number of inputs (a few other factors like multisig). Not related to the $ amount or BTC amount.
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:26:36


Not necessarily on a computer. I think this is important at least conceptually (and also practically) so people can get over the idea that it is somehow "bits and bytes". Bitcoins don't actually exist, not even as addressable memory.

Bitcoin's block size is actually dynamic, with a maximum between 3.7 and 4MB. Unlimited dynamic size is highly inadvisable imo but either way, this is not addressing scalability.


You don't understand; I'm talking about CT, which is based on Pedersen commitments; basically committing to amounts with curve points of the form C = rG + aH where a is the amount, r is a blinding factor, G is the generator point of the curve and H is another curve point whose discrete log w.r.t. G is not known (usually achieved by hashing and coercing the hash to a point). The problem is that such commitments are not perfectly binding, but only computationally so; anyone who did have the discrete log of H w.r.t G could open the commitment to any value. This makes the commitments invalid (if you have that secret) and so you could create coins invalidly by having one of the output values negative.
Could be based on that ^ if someone had some advantage of being able to solve ECDLP under some circumstances; super-unlikely but important to consider; more important is the fact that implementation failures *could* be invisible.


Yes, and this perfectly illustrates the point: Bitcoin had an integer overflow in 2010 resulting in billions of coins being created, but that was immediately visible, because amounts are plaintext, so supply is always globally auditable, in public.

The advice concerns when you're *receiving* funds. When you ask for a payment from someone, you give them an as-yet unused address.
When it comes to sending funds, you inevitably use what you have - which is "unspent transaction outputs" or utxos in your wallet; each of these will (usually) be associated with an address that you've already used to receive funds, by definition. But if you follow the advice above about receiving, each one of those utxos will be associated with a *different* address.

Not *from transactions*, no. The witness is stored in a separate section of the transaction. In the serialization I showed you exactly where, in the transaction, the witness is placed. Not sure how else I could explain it?

Certainly a valid question, and I think the answer is about both architecture and architectural complexity.
Consider the difference between say TLS/SSL, a protocol for a client-server conversation, and Bitcoin, which is a protocol in which an unknown number of participants calculate state updates asynchronously. There is a *huge* difference in complexity precisely as a result of the difference in the basic architecture: in the former, it is a "point to point" protocol: 2 sides do a handshake, pass messages between each other, and quit. In the latter case people are joining and leaving all the time, none have any special status, and they have to all agree on millions of transactions' state.
So for TLS you can write RFCs that, while complex, very carefully and in detail write the formats of the messages in a fixed sequence that have to be sent back and forth. And *even then it's not really good enough*! Some people have recently tried to formalize the protocol to get better security, but it has proved monstrously difficult, given the complexities of things like cipher suites (like different crypto languages the client and server can speak). But, still, a spec for this protocol is eminently possible to write although it's not perfect, and multiple software implementations talk together OK, with the occasional failure of course. (Edit: I should really emphasize the difference more starkly here: with TLS you can have 10 million connections doing *TLS version A* and another 20 million doing *TLS version B* and these can be *slightly* different in a way that even software developers didn't notice, and **it wouldn't necesarily matter**. That's what you don't have in a global consensus algo.)
Meanwhile the latter case is just an order of magnitude more difficult to write a spec for because you have to handle not just a fixed sequence of messages for updating a very narrowly confined set of states, but asynchronously handle all possible different 'views' of the blockchain, which itself is a hugely complex object (consider scripts and tx formats and forks and orphans and etc).
Lightning is much more like the former than the latter because it's fundamentally a point to point protocol. You don't have to include rules to take account of the whole state of the Lightning network and all its nodes, you only have to care about channels. I guess it's a bit more complex than TLS, I'm no expert, but it seems to be in that area.

Simple way to think of difficulty is its just ~ 1/target ; the target is the important idea; it's the numerical value that the block hash has to be less than to be a valid block.
Edit: unit. It doesn't have a unit, since target is just a number, and so is its inverse. Well also it's a ratio, so even if target had a unit, difficulty wouldn't :)

@_date: 2016-12-26 21:32:47


Disagree. Confirmation times are no slower now than they were one year ago, or any time; I have concrete evidence because I take part in ~ 5 coinjoin transactions per day. The fees have gone up, but it is not really "slower" unless your wallet is not attempting to estimate fees. My last 6 transactions had conf times: 1 min, 9min, 1min, 17min, 49 min.
I do think it is *possible* to get a situation where you have to wait a lot more blocks than you planned to, but it is *very* rare if your wallet is actually using fee estimates.

At the heart of it is the fact that in RSA and similar systems, you have a homomorphism/malleability. for example: RSA(a) * RSA(b) = RSA(a*b) (NB this is only 'textbook RSA'). In tumblebit they're not using blind signing, but effectively blinded encryption, but it's the same kind of trick, and the same surprising result: Bob can give Alice a blinded encrypted value, Alice can get the decryption of that to a still-blinded-but-now-decrypted value, pass it to Bob, who can unblind to get the unblinded-and-decrypted value.
You can see that that's very similar to giving a blinded message to a server, getting a signature, then "unblinding" the signature to get a sig on the real original message.
In both cases mathematically you're doing basically the same thing; just multiplying your plaintext/ciphertext by a random number modulo N. Then unblinding can be done by the owner of that random blinding factor by simply dividing by it.
I made some notes on this in the subsection "Blinding" [here](

52! is about 413 bits of entropy if i calculated that right. (*EDIT: looks like i entered it wrong and it's actually only 225 bits, which is a problem, arguably not a critical one though since that's enough entropy to be secure*). Should be more than enough. You could have a "canonical" ordering of the deck (example: Ace, 2, ... King hearts, then diamonds, then...). Then a shuffled order would encode a string of 52 integers, which could easily be converted to a &gt; 256 bit random number.
However, there is a **slight** practical problem with this idea in terms of its, shall we say, fragility :)
To state the obvious, don't actually do stuff like this with real money. Even apart from practical problems, getting it right crypto-wise requires a lot of expertise and there are too many ways you could horribly mess up.
That aside, I like this kind of thinking - use existing features of the world that are naturally random to encode secrets. I think steganography in general is under-explored, albeit there are good reasons it's not widely used in practical applications (low bit-rate). Several times I wondered if any advantage could be gained by using books in clever ways to encode seed phrases (but it's much harder than it first seems to make that work, I think).
@_date: 2016-12-05 20:44:48


A fundamentally important point that seems to be lost by those who perceive issues with companies like Blockstream: the Bitcoin protocol is open source and public. That means, if a new technology comes along like Lightning, cooked up originally by Poon and Dryja in 2014 iirc (although that attestation is an oversimplication), then it doesn't matter if a well-funded company like Blockstream decides to do an implementation. Because (a) nobody has to use it and (b) guess what, there are like 5 other implementations, and they're going to be inter-operable. Blockstream's one is open source and I believe all the others are too.
Their main sidechain codebase, Elements Alpha - the same stuff applies. If they build a non-open source sidechain (Liquid) to sell to corporations, it is of no consequence to us, precisely because it's a sidechain (I have no idea if that's true, just an example)&gt;
It's interesting how what I see as your main misunderstanding of Bitcoin - the nature of cash, settlement and layering - perfectly explains why you're misunderstanding the above points. The base layer of Bitcoin is and always will be exactly *cash*, which is to say a transfer without a 3rd party, full and final settlement (that's what makes cash cash). If we keep that base layer trustless successfully, then we can build any number of 2nd layer protocols, both completely trust-based ones, like accounts at Coinbase or Circle or whatever replaces changetip, and trustless ones like Lightning (assuming it rolls out as planned).
Because, according to my reading of the above, you haven't understood that the base cash layer is really "hard money" and is expensive and inefficient and relatively slow, and has to be those things in order to actually work, but instead believe in what (to me) is a fantasy version of Bitcoin where transactions are free and instant and scale to 10^8 txs/day and is still trustless (ironically, Lightning can promise *precisely all that, including the trustlessness* in the most optimistic interpretation), you think that not attempting to make that fantasy come true represents sinister intent. But it would be *precisely* by trying to aim for that fantasy that exactly what you fear would occur - if we went for hugely larger blocks, the only way to achieve really big "on chain scaling", we would make it impossible to run verifying nodes, we would centralize mining even more, and we would force users to trust third parties.
@_date: 2016-12-10 20:59:12
It's hoped that it can play that role, yes. The cost will be ultra-tiny (as in satoshis, not cents) because each transaction doesn't have to be published to the blockchain. They will also be near-immediate. And they will also be trustless, because they are updates to real bitcoin transactions in such a way that if your counterparty defaults, you can publish a finalizing transaction to the blockchain and get your money back.
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:28:23
To add to 's comment:
As well as scalability, there is a security tradeoff. Invisible inflation is possible due to either a bug (see early 2017 inflation bug discovery on monero mainnet due to misuse of curve with non-prime order, i.e. very fundamental implementation bug; a similar bug that related e.g. to rangeproofs might allow invisible inflation) or theoretically an ECDLP break of some sort (i don't take that *too* seriously short term, but again invisibility might mean undetectable inflation, which is pretty awful even if super unlikely).
If someone finds a more scalable way to do privacy than Monero, will you switch again? Are you sure you understand all the tradeoffs? If everyone switches to their favorite flavour of bitcoin every half-year, there will be no anonymity set growth via network effect, there will be no security growth via hashpower, etc. ...
I think the real long term success will be a combination of research into off-chain/layered solutions along with different flavours of ZKP techniques (note a digital signature, primitively, is one such), which are the way to cut the gordian knot of privacy vs scalability, and to do it with solid security (that last assertion is the dubious part ...).
An infinite sequence of less secure and less well studied altcoins is not the way (because this is supposed to be a money protocol).
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:03:30
Someone tipped me using this yesterday:
I guess it's similar to the old changetip, but if/when it, or something else, integrates Lightning, it should/could be very feasible to have genuinely decentralized tipping with effectively zero cost.
Having said that; I think there will always be a place for centralized solutions. They have advantages for ordinary users, even after you've removed the fees and the delay, as LN does in the ideal case.
There have been many attempts at centralized microtx tipping solutions over the years; changetip just happened to be a Bitcoin version (originally it was 'bitcointip' and went directly over the chain). The jury seems to be out as to whether anything like that will really take off at large scale.
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:23:39
A couple, though they're related:
1. You don't control the bitcoins yourself, so the exchange doesn't have to give them to you when you ask for them.
2. Because exchanges deal with lots of customers, they have to store a lot of bitcoins. Because they're constantly buying/selling, they have to keep these coins in "hot" wallets some of the time ("hot" here means there is direct access to the private keys). This is a perfect target for hackers; if they manage to hack the server and get access to those private keys, they can steal the bitcoins. Just one example from this summer, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges Bitfinex got ~ $70 million dollars stolen from them in minutes, and the customers had to take (some of) those losses.
Note how (2) can happen with an insider; even one rogue employee might be enough (in some cases, not usually) to steal the coins and pretend it was a "hack".

I can't believe people are still getting this wrong years later. The witness is stored in a different part of each transaction, not a different part of the block.
More importantly this:

is also absolutely false. There is NO 1MB limit ANYWHERE in bitcoin post-segwit. There is a 4M weight limit and nothing else.

Even if, as I suspect, you haven't really properly understood payment channels, I still think your overall point here is worthwhile and not given enough thought: that consumers are not generally looking to use pure cash on the internet. Paypal might be crippled a bit by regulations and end up with a shitty experience for merchants, but the model it creates for consumers is generally the one they want: pay a bit in fees, have to jump through some hurdles to set up an account, but for the *majority* of them, it gives them something simple, easy, fast and secure.
Off-chain and trust-based bitcoin payments *might* well become a thing longer term, and might be more successful than a Lightning style model. The latter might find some niches, e.g. rapid micropayments for content, accessible globally. These could be seen as two competing models of L2, with tradeoffs, but one thing's for sure: unless the base layer maintains rock solid robustness, we can forget about "mainstream adoption" via these approaches (and "mainstream adoption" on-chain is a fantasy, never going to happen).
@_date: 2016-11-26 23:27:38
In a weird kind of way joinmarket, and coinjoin generally, helps the problem by making it worse :) See the thing is Bitcoin has terrible anonymity but great *deniability*; a payment from A-&gt;B is entirely public, but knowing that A and B are linked is an entirely different matter. A payment from two inputs (A,B) to C *usually* means common ownership (one person) of inputs A and B, but in coinjoin, that assumption is no longer true either. If (A,B) pays (C,D) it gets even more hairy; did A pay B and C pay D? or vice versa? Or is D just the change going back to the owner of both A and B?
When people co-operate to make transactions, the actual linkages between people are multiplied, while the assumptions you can reasonably make get weaker. It would only require a reasonable number of people doing this to make the assumption unworkable (and that really hurts blockchain analysis). It's tricky stuff.

You're wrong in the ways that matter: the number of transactions/sec and the number of bytes over the wire (that is the most literal interpretation of 'blocksize').

I agree on the two main factual points; (1) it costs ~ $3-4 for this kind of transaction and (2) it becomes uneconomical for $1 payments.
Bitcoin has been quite uneconomical for $1 for a long while now. But for payments in the $25 as you mention, it's more or less fine. Your $3.74 tx was a fee of a quarter of a percent, that's highly competitive. What's unintuitive is that aggregation of payments doesn't change the economics, unfortunately: aggregating 100 such payments into one tx only shaves off a small fraction of the fee you'd pay if you moved each $25 individually.
Interesting to note: segwit would make that aggregation somewhat more effective in reducing costs, because it reduces the cost of the bulk of the inputs (the scriptSig).
Ultra low fees mean ultra-cheap DOS attacks on the network. Users, running nodes, do not appreciate having to process those attacks (and it's quite clear they've happened).
Bitcoin running at near capacity is a success, not a failure. To change to larger scale without having everything blow up is going to be hard, but that's why we have (a) segwit for ~2MB over time, (b)trustless off-chain payments. We can't bank on (b) getting a lot of up-take or use-cases quickly, but it's crazy to think we can have 1c fees on-chain in perpetuity, with bitcoin's usage continuing to grow further and further.

I remain puzzled as to why people thinking that voting with nodes makes any sense. It must be very easy to spoof, or just run a bunch of nodes as one person.
I know that's a slightly unpalatable truth; there isn't an easy way to do a vote while avoiding Sybil attacks here. Miners of course can vote, but we (quite understandably) don't want it to be only the decision of miners. In theory there could be a vote by coin ownership, but I doubt anyone wants that either. Anyway, I don't think the number of nodes proves anything.

Responding to:
Before I start my rant: I don't mean to imply that such research is useless of course. But!
It's so tiresome to see yet another person so full of their own expertise that they don't notice what's important.


.... assuming that the XKCD style passphrase is only 4 words. As he mentions later in the article, almost offhand, if it is 8 common words - or, how about 12-24 from a predetermined list? - it is safe. He mentions some obscure site warpwallet, which may be great for all I know, but not the wallets Electrum, Armory and others which people actually use - and which have solved this problem entirely.


Again, rather like V. Buterin who gave "proof" that a memorizable brain wallet is unsafe in the form of academic research that was drivel (because it didn't mention mnemonic techniques), this guy asserts that anything you can remember is unsafe. And is wrong for the same reason. 
And so another generation of people become convinced that it is impossible, under any circumstances, to store a Bitcoin wallet in your brain safely. False. Talk to the Electrum developers who solved this problem years ago.
For those unaware of the details - you might think 'mnemonic techniques' sounds difficult/technical and not something ordinary people would use. It is in fact utterly trivial and mundane: given 12-24 words make up a story around them. The brain remembers stories incredibly easily. Just a few minutes of effort repeated a few times over a shortish period and it is trivial to remember.
(I am not advocating storing a wallet *only* in your brain long term. Some combination of 'brain' storage and paper storage is probably right. And such word lists have several advantages on paper too. But the option of 'brain-only' is extremely powerful in certain situations, as has often been discussed.)

'log' is short for logarithm.
(Edit: the above post states it's 2048 words not 2000, not sure which is right but either way the difference in entropy is small)
Another way to write the description above is: there are 2000 possibilities for each word. Each word is chosen randomly, so there are 2000 x 2000 x 2000.... (12 times) possibilities in total (ignoring a small detail, this is basically right). That can be written as 2000^12.
Now, if we want to know how many bits of entropy that is, we express that huge number as a power of 2. So the number of bits of entropy, if called x, obeys:
    2^x = 2000^12
The calculation shown above with logs allows you to find that x.

It's a long, complicated story. However, of the two, Lightning is probably more relevant to the block size debate. Some might argue (and I might be one of them!) but Pieter Wuille, has been at pains to point out that sidechains are not a scalability solution. They're much more a technological solution for testing and using new features without risking problems on the main Blockchain.
Lightning on the other hand *is* designed to address scalability, and micropayments. The idea is to use a concept called "bitcoin micropayment channels" or just ["payment channels"]( which use a clever series of interactions to allow multiple payments over time (imagine paying for video per second), but all wrapped up inside one Bitcoin transaction. At first it sounds like this would involve having to trust a third party, but surprisingly it doesn't. 
Lightning extends the payment channel concept further; I haven't learnt the details but it involves 'hubs' between two people so they can use the above idea to transact Bitcoin without hitting the Bitcoin network as much, so making transactions much faster (near instant I think) and reducing the size of the blocks (remembering that as it stands, every transaction must be recorded in the Blockchain; in this system, only the "settling" transactions do). Something along those lines.
Edit: I should add that there is a lot of discussion about what the block size 'should' be even if Lightning is implemented; it doesn't make the question totally go away.

Your point of view is valid if one is thinking about breaks of hashing algorithms like sha256.
But it's not valid if you're thinking about brute-forcing breakthroughs, because what prevents the brute force approach from working against 256 bit entropy is *physics*, not a lack of mathematical techniques.

You can always get fiat money back precisely because it doesn't exist.
So it's got that going for it. The downside is: some guy in an office on the other side of the planet can create 50 trillion of it tomorrow and there's not much you can do about it. 
It's also rather difficult to send imaginary money from one side of the planet to the other in seconds without a trusted third party.
So, swings and roundabouts really.

That's certainly possible. The current alpha version of sidechains is a bit like that, with federated servers signing blocks (obviously it's just for a testnet, but in theory a company could adopt a model like that; I'm not sure whether they'd want to though, difficult to know at this early stage).

In the case of the 1.59 to a null seedphrase: similar in a way, but arguably we were lucky it happened the way it did. If you look at issue [190]( contributor/user tailsjoin (kudos to him) laid out in detail a very strange observation: that his Core Wallet, via the watch-only address feature that we use, was notifying him of transactions to a wallet he didn't think was his (he also noticed an issue with passwords which confuses the discussion a bit). This was obviously seriously disturbing, and so we looked into it. To save time, you can read more in the [reddit thread](

Fair point. If the definition of brainwallet is "brain generates entropy" then, unless I'm missing something, I agree: it's logical to say that that's entirely unsafe (I guess if a person is truly expert in the field, they could do a good job, but that's not very helpful).


Physical devices like USB sticks are not trustworthy in my opinion for this kind of purpose. Not to mention the hassle involved with the needed redundancy.
Storage of a seed phrase on paper makes sense, and can easily be done steganographically. Not to mention it can be encrypted (but like BIP38 the argument for doing so is a bit limited). 


In other words, you think it's highly unsafe; because it's difficult to memorize?
Imagine having to travel to the other side of the planet in an emergency, and where you were not feeling safe. Would you prefer to put your bitcoins on a phone, a USB stick, a piece of paper, or in your brain? The latter *is* an option. There *are* such things as mnemonic techniques and you *can* (easily!) remember a 12-24 word phrase. If you just try it you'll see that it's obviously true, and so all this "we can't use brainwallets" is seen in an entirely different light.
I have more than 1 such phrase which I don't need to call to mind for weeks or months at a time (and I first committed them to memory years ago). I tried right now and can recall them easily.

The article is arguing against the position "everyone should use one public blockchain/bitcoin!". 
But the substantive argument, to me, is about whether a "private blockchain" actually **makes any sense**, not about whether it should be replaced with a public one.


If easy reversibility is required, what is the value of a blockchain? Why not a simple database? Use signatures on updates if you want accountability, but a blockchain?


This seems to imply that you are considering proof of work as part of this description, although it's not clear in other places. If nodes are known (part of a consortium), they can simply sign database updates. In the scenario where history is reversible (see above), then proof of work can't be the rule to decide on the correct version of history (and neither can proof of anything). It must be whichever entity that can reverse deciding history (and that entity could be a consortium e.g. with voting).
You might argue that there are good technical reasons for a blockchain style proof-of-work or similar in order to help a broadly distributed system run with some convergence or consistency. I have been thinking about this and I'm not sure. It feels intuitively wrong to me. POW is inherently expensive and for good reason, and seems misused here.
I think that known identities + digital signatures basically gives you everything you need - you get non-repudiability meaning that any history rewriting must be accompanied by an explanation. I think that systems built like this are "blockchain" in name only, for marketing purposes.

Normal users don't have any rights in the matter of the total bitcoin supply. Nor do developers or miners. Do you think they should? Do you think there should be a vote about it?
Bitcoin wasn't designed to be something where we discuss every few weeks how we'd like to modify it. It was supposed to be more-or-less set in stone. Otherwise how much sense does it make to store value in it, if next year it could be something entirely different?
As for feeling that you have less rights than developers or miners - well, as for the former, you can become one. There is no entry fee to making commits to github. For the latter, in theory the same, except it needs a lot of capital to get into the mining game. Same thing with gold/silver mining. Yet most don't complain that they can't do that.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:34:14


And this can be done in an environment of known participants using digital signatures and (optionally) hash functions. Unfortunately it has a big downside - those participants have censorship rights. Is that a downside for some other applications? Almost certainly not; but if you trust people not to censor, you don't really have much of a technical problem to solve. To put it crudely, you "sign database updates". Not exactly earth shattering.
For those not aware, the principal function of digital signatures is "non-repudiability". This is what makes such a database quasi-irreversible. Quasi in the sense that, yes, you can delete part of the database and say "no, that didn't happen", but somebody could have recorded what happened before you deleted, present it to the world and say "look, he lied!". Notice how this is dependent on identity - a signature is a signature by a certain identity.
This technology is a couple of decades old (+) and well understood.
Bitcoin's blockchain's main innovation is to use proof of work to make the same thing happen with a completely anonymous set of participants, so that there is not even a set of trusted participants that are needed. The big upside is - *no one, not even any of the anonymous participants, can effectively censor the events embedded in the chain*. The only caveat is that you need less than 50% of the hashpower to be colluding.

It's obviously a complicated picture, but I think one thing worth mentioning is: Schnorr and MAST fit together very nicely, because they address two sides of the same problem: MAST address both privacy and scalability in the scriptPubKey/redeem script (you only have to reveal the branch you're executing), while Schnorr addresses the same issues on the scriptSig/witness side (so you may only have to publish one signature even if it's N of N multisig, so N times smaller on chain *and* may not reveal what the multisig policy was (not 100% sure on that last point)). CT and coinjoin can fit together with Schnorr since (a) CT makes coinjoin much more practical and may end up positively financially incentivising it and (b) aggregating signatures with Schnorr may again financially incentivise coinjoin.
But all that stuff is quite separate from (albeit there'll be crossover effects) from Lightning and payment channels, because the above is all about what happens on-chain.

Thanks for the clarification; I am talking about that url only, not your presentation, which I haven't looked at. Others have already pointed me there, and it seems indeed that you are not making a simplistic argument "you can't remember a brain wallet" which is what I'm actually ranting against.

This was discussed before, but I'd love for an easy wallet like that to have a slider: 0%..100% that you can set for what proportion of it you want to be Bitcoin.
It would be distinctly non-trivial working out the best way for the backend of that to work, but it would be great to be able to set it to 1% or 10% or even 50% (after all you're probably not going to put *all* your money in the thing), and that way express your preference for having Bitcoin without getting exposed to more volatility than you can stomach.

Not short sighted at all; all scarcity is energy or space scarcity (one can throw time into the list but time is a very elusive concept).
Consider as an example the concept of "peak X". At some point in the last decade people got very interested in the concept of peak oil (peak in the sense peak of production), which was a kind of nuance on the more basic concept that oil is finite.
Then a lot of people started cross-applying the concept, e.g. "peak copper". But peak copper makes no sense, because when copper is used it is not *consumed*. Previously used copper can be recycled; one can argue it's much more expensive to recycle than mine, but that doesn't alter the basic fact that copper doesn't disappear. On the other hand, if one takes the elements constituting oil and recombines them after use ("oil recycling"), one is doing something entirely pointless, because the whole reason to use the oil in the first place is to generate energy from it, and if it takes more energy to recombine than the amount of energy you get out, then it's a senseless activity. The point is that when we talk about "using" oil, we're really talking about "using" the energy content.
You can go further; there isn't really a finite amount of gold, it's just that the amount of energy required to generate gold from, say, iron using a series of nuclear fusion reactions is astronomical, literally. So again it's really an energy scarcity.
There is a concept called "Liebig's law" in ecology which says that the carrying capacity of a system is limited by the most scarce resource; some people try to use this to argue that the human population is vastly higher and so must crash, my counter to that is that energy is *always* the scarce resource and we aren't close to using all that's available (see solar, nuclear).
It's my intuition that many people have a gut reaction to proof of work that it feels kludgy and wrong and wasteful to them, but I think that's because they haven't studied physics enough, or maybe more precisely that they don't believe that physics should even enter into this discussion. POW always felt right to me; energy/work is the most fundamentally non-fakable thing.

Believe it or not, this debate has been raging in Bitcoin since pre-2013 (I can't say how much pre- because I got involved in early that year). I seem to remember Peter Todd giving a talk warning about it then (it was probably San Jose conference, not sure). It was confined to far fewer people then of course.
Lightning didn't even exist as an idea before some time in 2014 as I recall. Although the tech behind it (payment channels) has been known for years, and as it happens, Mike Hearn was one of the main proponents of that from the early days. He wrote the explanation on the wiki for it (and put code for it into BitcoinJ as I recall).
If you've been given the impression that it's about pushing a Lightning-agenda then you've been seriously misled. There is a *real* argument here, it's not about having agendas.

*This* one does, yes. If you know that only 90% of people are going to accept the 100 dollar bill in your hand, what are you going to do with it? Try very quickly to switch it for one that 100% of people will accept, that's what! Money has to be fungible. That requires a global consensus.
There have been plenty of times in the past (including the recent past) where, in a particular country or region, this kind of doubt over the value of money has occurred. The usual result is hyperinflation as everyone tries to dump it on everyone else.
Bitcoin is *not* perfectly fungible today. But it's good enough (it's worse than banknotes in this regard, but not too much worse - one can argue about this). 
If we are going to vote on protocol features by forking the chain so that not everyone agrees on the state of the ledger, it will fail.

Using a full node is highly recommended if you're to act as a 'maker' in JoinMarket terminology. See [here]( for some discussion.

Should you "dump a bunch of btc on a machine and run it and not worry"; no, there are no guarantees here. I've put some coins on there, but not too much. In the few months it's been running on mainnet we've seen two interesting cases - (1) a person who gave 2.8 btc to a maker because they weren't paying attention to how insanely high the requested fee was. some extra warnings were added but that will always be possible because by design it's a free market. (2)a person who accidentally put 1.59 coins into an easily hackable wallet (by putting a blank bip32 wallet seed phrase in). I swept that and gave it back to them, and fixed the bug/loophole.
I list these two (which I believe were the only two cases of people losing or nearly losing coins) to illustrate that this is not some super-battle-tested codebase. On the bright side, if the code does what it purports to do, then there is no trust issue; you are not handing over coins to someone else in coinjoin.

The only interesting discussion to me is not 'will we have fractional reserve with btc' etc. (there is already shorting, options, all kinds of stuff, of course there will be plenty of 'virtual' btc around, as you put it). The interesting question is whether the characteristics of btc will change how this works, compared to the former situation with gold. I've had this discussion a few times on here, for example will we need an 'audit the ~~Fed~~ Coinbase' movement? (referring to company as an example of a 'bitcoin bank'). The argument is about whether the transparency of the blockchain changes everything (you can sign and prove ownership, also see existing work on exchange audits using e.g. Pedersen commitments), or whether the ease of transfer across the world helps or hinders people from storing their own wealth outside banks.

I think there's a middle ground in this debate, and one interesting aspect is the extent to which modern wars initiated by the U.S. are funded with no financial consequences for the citizenry (the fact that the army is entirely voluntary and paid is another point, although maybe off topic); in earlier times (let's say the transitional period to full fiat currency) there were such things as 'war bonds'.
Some people will say 'ah, but there are consequences in terms of inflation' but to be honest pretty much all the consequences are imposed externally (e.g. inflation is in some sense exported). Although that's debatable.

little higher than what our competition charges. Too much higher than that,
and people will just say, you know what .... I'll make a bank transfer.
I disagree with this, for the simple reason that bank transfers do not offer the same feature as Bitcoin transfers: censorship resistance. They *do* offer a kind of quasi-irreversibility, but not to the same extent. But they absolutely do not offer censorship resistance, as evidenced by the hordes of people who have had transfers to Bitcoin exchanges blocked.
This doesn't mean I think Bitcoin transfers should be $25+ :) But we could contemplate a future where things like payment channels are how people actually use Bitcoin, while the base layer network *is*  expensive. Although not today of course.
@_date: 2015-08-23 11:24:07
Well; that's an argument about the layers above the base layer. I guess you're right about that, but note that there is no requirement that LN be the only layer built directly atop the blockchain; we already have, e.g. Coinbase (disambiguation: the company), which could indeed be fractional reserve at some stage.

Bitcoin uses not just base58 but [base58check]( encoding; see the section on encoding private keys. Note that this refers to Bitcoin core; other wallets can choose to encode private keys any way they like, their encoding is not part of the protocol, since they are never published; fundamentally they're just 256 bit numbers. Having said that, WIF is generally understood by a lot of wallets I think. 
Also, see the [Bitcoin Developer Reference]( for more details.

This dodges the issue. People on here always say "stop using that shitty bank, use this one" as if there was any bank that actually allows you freedom to use your money. As far as I can tell, the only reason some banks *temporarily* allow you to use your account to buy Bitcoin is ignorance.
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:24:55
Yes, it's the *actual* cost - the cost of seignorage, not the cost of transaction fees.
If it was transaction fee cost, it would not be payable for blocks where there are no non-coinbase transactions. But, it is, so, trivially, it is not a transaction cost.
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:32:03
Coinjoin is not a 'thing' actually - it's just Bitcoin. coined (oops) the term 'CoinJoin' and gave a wonderful description of it [here]( So it has no cryptographic assumptions other than those of Bitcoin.
For example, take this transaction from May 27th:  - an 11 party JoinMarket join. Notice that 11 different outputs have the same btc amount. It is *fundamentally* indistinguishable as to which of the inputs instigated which output. The other outputs are a different story - they are called 'change' outputs and they certainly can, in principle, be linked to various of the inputs, usually probabilistically but sometimes near-deterministically.
There are important security (and crypto) issues to be addressed and peer reviewed, but they are kind of 'higher level' - the messages between counterparties are E2E encrypted - is that done right? If not, then Coinjoin's promise is irrelevant (edit: well, not irrelevant - there's still value for everyone when the assumption 'all inputs come from one user' is broken), as a snooper can see which outputs were requested by which inputs, and so the joining at the transaction level becomes useless.
Also note Joinmarket's intrinsic asymmetry - the requester of the join (who pays a fee for this privilege) gets his join done immediately, and moreover has the privilege of constructing the entire transaction and therefore knowing who requested which output. For this reason, the 'makers' (the ones offering the join liquidity) don't get the same privacy as the 'taker' (who pays the fee). It's still a considerable privacy bump for their utxos anyway, of course.
Note that there are additional proposals, such as the blinding mechanism described in the CoinJoin post I linked above as well as 'CoinShuffle' (think Bitcoin + onion routing) - there's a paper out there that's quite readable. That last has not been implemented in JoinMarket, though it's been discussed.

Well, given such a large amount, fair point - as of today, you won't have the same liquidity with bitcoin as with cash. But for people in extremis, the ability to *not need to carry* your *savings* across jurisdictional boundaries could be quite something.
The fact that $75K in btc can't be liquidated immediately is true today, but not necessarily in the future.
And for smaller amounts, it's already useful - I did it myself a while back; carried no bitcoin wallet across the border, but arriving at my destination, was able to install a wallet, type in the seed, log into localbitcoins and then do an exchange to get my spending money for my vacation.

No, being a good programmer has nothing to do with it. It is just as easy to have the block reward go on indefinitely as to reach an asymptotic limit. (edit: unless you mean limitations in size of data types; but that would be pretty trivial to overcome).


No disagreements here.


My perspective is different, although not that different. There is evidence (I forget where he wrote this) that he chose it as an analogy to the mining of a resource like a precious metal. I shouldn't think it would be too hard to find the quote. This is something that has already played out in human history. That doesn't definitively mean your description is wrong though, by any means - "least unsatisfactory" is not an unreasonable perspective. I happen to think it was a very wise choice, but that's opinion rather than fact.
Yes, he was unhappy to see mining accelerate so fast, but I'm not sure that that proves very much either way.

First, this info can only be extracted if the multisig has been spent from. If it has:
You can find out the policy just by looking at the spending transaction opcodes. E.g. look at  
and see the numbers '2' and '3' for M and N. The three pubkeys used in the construction of the msig address are shown between the '2' and the '3'.
Of course it's pretty easy to extract that data directly from the txhex.
For finding out which pubkeys did the signing: This is a bit more involved. In pybitcointools you can do this by taking the txhex and doing : 
     modtx = signature_form(txhex,index,redeemscript,SIGHASH_ALL)
then 
    ecdsa_tx_recover(modtx,sighex)
and it'll spit out two possible pubkeys for that signature ('sighex'); one will be correct. You'll need to do this for each of the provided signatures.
There should be something similar in any bitcoin utilities library; not recommending pybitcointools, it's just the one I've used.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:06:40
It's a very fair question, maybe *the* question. My hope has always been that Bitcoin would ossify as fast as possible (ideally it would get embedded into hardware in ways that make it near impossible to update, but that isn't happening soon unless 21 inc have been way more effective than we thought..). My point being that, indeed, you cannot avoid politics except by permanently fixing the protocol in place, so the questions don't even arise.
 A corollary to that opinion is that the only realistic future for Bitcoin is as a raw protocol on which layers are built, but not in the direct way that layers are built on TCP/IP, because that's not scalable (Bitcoin is, crudely, broadcast and not point to point). It either has to scale sideways (sidechains - but this is problematic because sidechains don't *primarily* offer a scaling advantage - they are more about creating additional features outside an ossified core network protocol) or by 'netting', analogous to how in the current financial system there are accounts held at the central bank or clearing house by smaller banks so that they can net their positions regularly). This latter option is of course what Lighthouse or similar is supposed to offer, but with the amazing advantage potentially, of maintaining the critical feature of trustlessness..

(By the way, the Greek govt was forced into capital controls by the run on the banks caused by the withdrawal of the ELA. It's more complicated than that in some ways, because the Greeks could and should have abandoned the Euro earlier, but on the other hand the people didn't want Euro exit.)

Be careful to distinguish escrows from arbitrators. With multisig, you don't have to place the funds with the third party (which creates a risk that they will take the money or be hacked and have it all stolen, in a central location).
As for anonymous, it certainly doesn't have to be the case that arbitrators are anonymous.


Nowhere near that simple.

Re: CT and Coinjoin, yes. Combining them is ideal. CT as currently implemented has limitations with respect to transaction size, but an ideal system would have some combination of both (unlinkability and confidentiality).
As to your last comment, I think it's worth remembering how important fungibility is - as long as some people are de-linking their utxos, then it helps everyone, since blockchain analysis becomes highly unreliable - specifically you can't assume that all the transaction inputs are from the same person. Fungibility is valuable in all cases, even when you don't care about your own privacy; you want your coins to be unconditionally acceptable.

Yes, phone. Losing your phone (or it crashing/wiping etc) needn't mean losing the money though, there are several different mechanisms that can allow recovery (depends on which software you use).
So while that's a problem, a bigger problem is probably security, e.g. making sure you can trust your wifi and so on. Overall, it's safe enough to use a phone for small amounts, but definitely not for savings. So it's a bit like a physical wallet in that sense.
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:18:51
One detail: yes, paper wallets as originally conceived are a poor solution in terms of convenience of retrieval (although, if you know exactly what you're doing, they are an option). And yes, determinstic wallets are a no-brainer; everyone should use them. But why not both? A 12/24 word seed on paper is pretty much a perfect backup. It can be hidden steganographically in a larger text. If you don't trust paper, you can use a more sturdy medium fairly easily. Nothing has to be stored digitally on unreliable devices. No access to the internet is required. Such seeds can also be remembered very easily using mnemonic techniques.
That aside, the "rubber hose file system" approach for a wallet is a good idea, albeit I agree it'll be really hard to design well.

It only seems outlandish if you don't know the history. The Greek drachma was a joke in Europe; there were waves of massive devaluation. Typical inflation rates in the 80s were 20%, persistently, and only in the 90s did things start to stabilize (maybe because of the Euro project or the EU, not sure).
Abandoning the Euro is seen as going back to the bad old days by Greeks, presumably.
Having said all that I still tend to agree that the Greek desire to stay in the Euro is misguided ... they should have defaulted on the debt and switched currencies years ago. It would have been nice if that had destroyed some of the banks who clearly "deserved" to be destroyed (from a market perspective), but that option was swiftly removed by the bureaucrats who made sure the only people that would get hurt would be the taxpayers, as usual.

It is not a matter of law that that IOU is honored. However, in some jurisdictions there *may* be some kind of insurance scheme (mandated by law or not) that "guarantees" you get the money back even if the bank fails.

Interesting, I'm not sure if you could make a theory that daily volatility/standard deviation is reduced by derivatives (let's just say futures, although could include options) but kurtosis (vol of vol if you like, not the same thing but sort of) is increased.
My argument would be: because the arrival of price-impacting "news" (which could be information about future supply, not necessarily "Greece is going to default") tends to be "jump"-y / discrete, then the extent to which derivatives make the price look more like a staircase and less like a ramp, it is actually making the price a better signal.
Which at a kind of meta-level ought to be obvious - more liquidity, more ability to express preferences and opinions (which derivatives certainly give you) - will result in a healthier market over time.

Yes, but it's not illogical. It's not internally inconsistent.
Where do I say it's not OK for people to prefer a bank account, or, more generally, to prefer systems with consumer protection? 
That was never the pro-Bitcoin argument; the pro-Bitcoin argument is simply that we should have a choice. At the moment, we don't, except in the extremely limited sense of physical peer to peer cash payments. And even that has become massively risky - witness many recent stories of civil forfeiture in the US where people have had thousands of dollars "confiscated" without any charge or arrest. Witness cases of people being denied large cash withdrawals from their bank accounts.
Bank actions in the case of Bitcoin purchases are indeed arbitrary. I've been following this for years and the evidence is very clear on that. That doesn't mean there is no reason for it, just that it is, indeed, arbitrary.
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:46:51


Yes, your logic is sound - in an environment where all parties are known, attribution is unambiguous. You have some of that today in Bitcoin, but it's not the same as miners can be fairly anonymous with effort.
But here's what I don't get : if all parties are non-anonymous, what the heck is wrong with each party just digitally signing their transactions and adding to an append-only linked list!? Why do you need proof-of-work? Or proof of anything? You have identity.
Edit to add: double spend is not an issue if you have accountability. The whole double spend problem arose because we want digital *cash* where you don't have to care about its origin.

My Electrum has been using 0.0002 for quite a while (a year maybe?) Other wallets vary from what I know.

Some might think that, in this case, a blockchain is still unnecessary: a digital signature already gives non-repudiability. Why does the digital signature have to be embedded in the/a blockchain? 
The answer is back to the double-spend-prevention feature: property conflicts are not possible (the authority can't change its mind and assign the house to Bob instead of Alice).
Only a truly totalitarian state will comfortably ignore its own deeds when anyone can see it is lying.

I'm no historian, but I believe it's true that in the middle wages, a lot of war was funded with debt as well as violent tax collection. Although it's also true that war could be very profitable for the victor, so lending to the king wasn't always a losing proposition perhaps :)

Using large integers is clearly not anything like a big problem in this kind of code - ECC works with 256 bit integers for a start. Encoding of amounts is trivial by comparison with what the secp256k1 stuff has to do.

People don't seem to get it. You get a "perfect user experience" by having a service totally centralized. That's what shapeshift is. I hope nobody is under the illusion that their transactions are untraceable on shapeshift, by the way (plus you have to pay them of course).
Far too many people are only interested in Bitcoin if it is exactly as convenient as their current world. Honestly, just go back to your banks and credit cards and Amazon. There is nothing here for you, at least not today.
Edit: OK that's too strong :) There are 2 things: better security than using credit cards online wrt identity theft, credentials. Second thing: Bitcoin as a speculation. But it's ridiculous to expect a decentralized Bitcoin-based market to be as convenient as a centralized one.
On the other hand, Bitcoin offers possibilities for commerce for some people that didn't exist before. If that's you, or you just want to support that, then get involved but don't expect it to be the same as a centralized service!

Hardware failure or breakage and simply losing the device are the main 2 reasons I wouldn't even consider storing large amounts on a phone. 
Edit: But actually, deterministic wallet backups (12 word seeds) ought to be good enough. As long as you password protect your wallet in case it gets stolen, it could be OK. 
The other big issue is the mobile in mobile phone: I would never do operations on a savings wallet in a public area using public wifi; even using a friend's wifi.

As one of the contributors, this is absolutely true. We shouldn't try to sell joinmarket as CoinJoin for grandma just yet :) But if you're technically literate, give it a try. 
Wallet integration would be the ideal scenario, but it's non trivial. Electrum was one thought, but not sure if any progress has been made up to now.
Another thing that ought to be done is to create binaries, I think, because installation is a bit hairy (although I wrote a little guide for [installing on Windows]( (which works for Win10 now btw) - but as you can see it's fiddly, and one should be careful about trusting the downloads. There will also be issues with trusting binaries, of course, although that's solvable.
In the absence of wallet integration right now, someone could help by trying to create a gui interface for sendpayment.py.
We also need more depth; if you have a Bitcoin Core node, you can consider offering some coins to join.

If they don't have any 2FA, then that is pretty appalling.
Comparison with Bitcoin privkeys don't really work, because you never use a Bitcoin privkey to "log in" to anything - that's the great feature of public key cryptography, the private key is *never* passed over the wire. Hence the possibility of super-high security using the "cold wallet" concept.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:20:11
I believe they've been doing very high throughputs in testing, no reason to think that it won't be possible to repeat (whether it'll happen is different of course, because I guess txs will cost money!). I don't know how stable it's going to be though; from what I saw there was a bit of forking going on. 12(? about that) second block times for a global network seems somewhat ambitious.
Edit: oh, I read the linked thread. It's impossible to keep up but are they talking about a future "stage" where they're going to 2/4 second block times?
@_date: 2015-07-13 13:40:31
The hash of the pubkey in the scriptPubkey is not enough, because hashes are irreversible: you can't figure out the pubkey from its hash. To verify the signature, you need the pubkey, hence the pubkey is embedded in the scriptSig. What the scriptPubkey does is enforce the linkage between the previous output and the new input; the script will fail if the hash of the pubkey provided in the scriptsig does not equal the value in the scriptPubkey.
It would have been possible to put the (unhashed) pubkey in the scriptPubkey, of course, but that has the disadvantage of exposing the pubkey on the network immediately. There might be other reasons too, but I'm not sure about it (not sure about the space usage implications of doing it the other way).
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:04:10
Yes, one *could* make that model (or any other, pretty much).
It's a bit like saying, if Hollywood movies didn't have car chases and action scenes, they would really struggle to be popular.
Satoshi didn't make an exponential decay style inflation schedule for no reason. It was one of several extremely well conceived decisions (imo, but not only me!)  (An analogy from nature/history, i.e. resource mining) 
The inflation schedule lasts 130ish years. Some will say "oh but halvings are catastrophic and a few more of them and the reward will be a pittance, nobody will mine!" To assert that as 'fact' shows a very skewed mental model; it *could* happen like that - 10 years later and hashing power dwindles to nothing along with price. But the only evidence we have so far indicates nothing of the sort - the first halving was associated with a large increase in hashing power and price.
You're arguing about steady state economics for Bitcoin, which is an interesting topic, but a long way off. What we have today is *not* an economics based on transaction fees (that's there to prevent DOS principally), but an economics based on block reward. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:23:31


Yes, it *might* be, but people overplay this. Take this simple example: suppose you transfer 1BTC to your personal wallet address 1AB. Then you transfer that 1BTC from 1AB to 1YZ. Then, you use that 1YZ amount for (insert purpose). How does Coinbase know that 1YZ is yours, and not someone else's (someone you paid 1BTC to?). Of course, for this, it greatly helps if your wallet does something sensible like *always receive to a new address* (so 1YZ is entirely new, not already used by your wallet!).
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:14:50
Correct. Fascinating fact: Satoshi actually said this in the whitepaper, and I believe it's the only thing in there that's categorically wrong:


transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.

@_date: 2015-07-26 14:17:20


Nobody does this, and nobody should. However, the deduction that because 2 inputs are used in one transaction they are the same entity is false - see coinjoin (e.g. the example I gave in the other comment).
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:25:13


People talk about it all the time - 'millibits', 'bits' etc. But there is nothing to actually *do*, because there's no central authority to make a final decision; it's just a choice that each user and each software package makes. A lot of wallets allow you to view in millibits instead of bitcoins, for example.
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:12:21
For myself, it's really difficult to say for sure. I think it's easier to come at it from the other side : when is it useful to timestamp data in a blockchain? I would say in situations when you have a similar problem to solve as Bitcoin itself, but with data: you have a group of agents who are not identified to one another but who want to come to agreement on the time ordering of events. Does NASDAQ fit that? I really don't know. The above argument is more about situations where the set of agents is set in advance, and they're identified. I don't see the need for a blockchain there.
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:05:05


Bitcoin is not using an especially sexy kind of elliptic curve cryptography; it's a very well established standard elliptic curve digital signature scheme (ECDSA) which has been around for a long time, and is in wide use. The particular curve used (secp256k1) is not in such wide use, but it's one of a NIST family of curves that is.
Bitcoin mining doesn't use elliptic curve cryptography at all; it uses the sha256 cryptographic hashing algorithm, which is in similarly wide use (wider perhaps).
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:51:35


You can use (a) in house systems like they do now (what's the point of a blockchain then?) (b) smaller cryptocurrency blockchains (very low hashing power/security, unproven) (c) some revolutionary new implementation that hasn't even been launched (Ethereum .. OK, not sure if fair to even mention since the NASDAQ implementation might not fit into their model) (d) Bitcoin, massive hashpower security, stable and running for many years at high volume.
Which do you choose? It isn't *obvious* that the answer is (d), it very much depends on what you're trying to achieve, but I wouldn't be surprised. I also wouldn't be surprised by (a), but you have to kind of torture the word "blockchain" to make that really make sense.
If you're worried about the potential for forks, then other existing blockchains are hardly better.
Of course if your point is simply 'bitcoin cannot handle more than 3/7/whatever tps', then you might be right. Everything depends on what they're trying to do.

I would say, no, it's not as straightforward, but that is partly a function of unfamiliarity. For small transactions, where you don't mind accepting unconfirmed (this can be configured by payment processors), it would be quite possible for the whole process to be about as quick as card swipe type systems. Say, a 10-20 second interaction.

@_date: 2015-07-26 17:02:57
No, it's not an exception to the rule because the inputs come from coinjoins; it's already an exception to the rule just by virtue of the fact that 11 different participants created the inputs. The rule in the tweet is not true; it's true for *most* transactions today, but not all.

The disenchantment described here is echoed in other places, but I find it curious. Even Satoshi knew we were going to have mining in huge datacenters; if you think that's contra the spirit of Bitcoin, first I disagree, but second, it was very easy to see it coming.
And I'd have a similar comment about Bitpay, consumerism and startups/regulation etc. How else did you think it would work? That Bitcoin would become an enormous success in the black and grey markets and no one else would pay any attention? By design, it's open to anyone, whatever their views.

But that's a superficial analysis. User adoption is the *definition* of success for those applications, but stating it doesn't help us to find the cause of success/failure.


That users *matter* is a given, but again it doesn't help us determine how that comes about. I believe there is a feedback loop, but I also believe there's something more than that. Do you believe gold became perceived as valuable just because of a growth of users? A good marketing campaign? Surely you'd agree it was because it had a certain set of properties making it attractive. So, similarly with Bitcoin, it has certain properties making it attractive. I'm not saying the term "censorship resistance" completely, or even accurately, describes those properties, but I do believe it's the properties that drive the users over the long term.

Hmm, it's true that a blockchain *alone* doesn't prevent double spending. You need PoW and absence of majority collusion to attack, let's say ... but after all, double spend prevention is exactly the purpose of the blockchain design.
"Blockchain isn't enough" != "you don't need a blockchain".
As to your second point, sure, in some cases, but you can't retroactively erase all knowledge of data that was earlier distributed over a peer to peer network, even with threats of violence. You really have to just not distribute it in the first place.
Maybe a better counterargument is "you don't need a blockchain because merely the existence of a contradictory signature proves fraud by the authority", but I think it might depend on whether ownership is time-dependent.

A crude attack from a single node/IP of course wouldn't work. But spread out it becomes impossible to distinguish between the spam and the real transactions (because it's part of Bitcoin's philosophy that we don't rely on identity). Without identity (only people with certain pgp keys can broadcast txs), the only defence against DOS is bitcoin itself - either fee payment or signing ownership (which is why very large transactions can be free).

My sympathies; indeed even for the most security-sensible, an initial bulk purchase is one of the places you have the most risk.
Some ideas:
* Do as much DD as possible. Look for a company with some history and volume that isn't getting any negative feedback along the lines of 'they robbed me' or 'delays'; other kinds of negative feedback, as long as not too much, doesn't have to be a dealbreaker.
* Make a test purchase first. Even if it means the fee on the transaction is a bit high %-wise. The test **should include moving the funds all the way to your bitcoin wallet**.
* Avoid a company entirely; use localbitcoins or similar and do a P2P transaction, ideally for cash in person. However, this greatly limits the size of transaction that's sensible (&lt; $1000 I'd say, although you might be even more cautious). This won't work for everyone.
Would be interested to hear which part of this fell down in this case (I haven't investigated IGOT at all so won't comment on them).

I know this analogy was widely circulated by Andreas Antonopolous (not saying that's where you got it, I'm talking to everyone here), but: please stop using it.
It's a catastrophically bad analogy from a didactic point of view, because it gives people the exact mental model that you'll naturally have if you have no idea how the underlying tech works, and that mental model involves trust/credit. LN is emphatically 100% not credit. So it is not bar tabs.
The only analogy I've heard that comes close to properly conveying what's going on is that of a law court with a cryptographically incorruptible judge. We don't have to ask the judge to read and decide on every contractual agreement between two people in the city; he only gets involved when there's a dispute. And when there is a dispute, they present their versions of contracts (with their signatures in key places!) such that he can pass judgement with perfect accuracy, hence he's an automaton.
Hence one law court could support 500,000 people instead of say 100 people. Etc.
(Thus it's easy to see the system only fails when there's a traffic gridlock in your part of the city and you can't get to the law court to show your contract agreement before time X, because the guy who paid you got to court earlier and asked the judge to agree with an old version of the contract, and the judge will agree with him after time X (those were the terms!). So we see in LN the censorship resistance of the underlying blockchain becomes a security requirement - publishing a transaction = having the judge pass verdict in this rough analogy).

Just try it. It's fairly obviously true. This is how the human brain works. Also people have been using this since God knows when; you don't need a study to tell you a simple, known practical fact. There *is* an argument about how well it will work, and how it will vary from person to person, fair enough, but it's not like a completely novel invention.
If you're a bit suspicious it might go wrong, that's understandable - but the idea is to make the story hit the words as 'keynotes', make the story somehow striking or emotionally resonant, and repeat it several times over a short period - the first few days. It *will* sink in, deep, after that. You'll only have to revisit it very occasionally (after a while you can ignore it for months and it'll still come back, not that I'd recommend relying on that).
Edit: I just realised there might be a slight misunderstanding here (probably not, but): there's no need to remember the whole story as words! I just remember it as images and ideas, and use the 12 (or whatever) keywords as signposts for that story. I don't try to remember any other words.
I remember reading the study you quoted, and as far as I recall it ignored this mnemonic technique. Its analysis of passphrases ignores this entirely (I think? I just had a quick look again).
That's why I think that study is just wrong, when it comes to Bitcoin wallets, because it pushes people into poorly conceived workarounds instead of using what their mind has evolved to do.
And yes it's paradoxically a case of remembering far more than 100 bits of "entropy", but again - using the brain's strength, not its weakness.

If you want cheap and fast, there are about 100 corporate attempts that probably come very close to what you want. Credit cards that give rewards, cutting the fees to very low levels, with huge consumer protection built in. Or interbank payments in less than a minute like the UK's Faster Payments. Or Apple Pay type stuff (although I don't think that's cheap).
If you think Bitcoin means "cheap and fast" first and foremost, then you have no idea what Bitcoin is.
Bitcoin promises censorship-resistant and irreversible payments, so a form of electronic money that functions more like cash. It's great if it can be done for ultra-low fees, but that was never the *core* promise. You simply cannot make a global transaction network costless to use, because if it was literally always-zero cost then it just requires *one* person in the world to want to bring it to a stop, and they can, by issuing an endless stream of meaningless transactions.

I see two distinctions: first, I don't trust hardware like USB sticks. Too many ways for it to go wrong, I would never seriously consider disks of any type as backups for money, personally.
 But the other point is, it is possible to get a seed both "memorizable" and "worth a damn".
There's a widely held belief in the security community that those two things are incompatible, and indeed it's plausible - but it's categorically wrong. Use basic (obvious really) mnemonic techniques, it's easy to convert 128 bits + of genuine entropy into something your brain can store easily for years. Wallets like Electrum give you the setup to do exactly that.
E.g. The practical scenario is - you want to go on an international trip and use bitcoin. Take a TAILS usb (or just your laptop for smaller amounts), don't store any bitcoin related data on it, easily recover your wallet when you arrive. Better than storing data in the cloud, even encrypted.
This doesn't mean I would keep my life savings in a memorized phrase (although it's conceivable) long term, it seems incautious, have it written down on paper and stored safely. Paper is to my mind more trustworthy than silicon here, but one can argue about different kinds of storage.

The reason I haven't agreed with this, recently, is it's become so clear that Bitcoin is now under severe threat from a small mining oligopoly, who refuse to listen to reason. This position (don't do anything) gives them carte blanche. They can continue to lie saying "Core is doing nothing for scaling, stagnating" and use it to further push their agenda, while gaining more and more power.
Ironically the covert asicboost revelation is what pushed me from just "this is very worrying" to "we need to at least try a UASF". Just the fact that it exists is a clear and present danger, let alone the terrible centralization of ASIC production in itself. I no longer believe "do nothing" is a viable option.

Segwit is a block size increase to 2MB. It *is* the compromise. It is also a soft fork, so less disruptive. It also improves scaling in several other ways.
Adding a *hard fork* to it which creates effectively a 4MB block size limit, with the possibility of creating 8MB blocks, is a bad idea, not a compromise.
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:21:36


False. Some Core devs agreed to make a HF proposal if miners didn't signal Classic. Miners immediately went ahead and signalled Classic; some  Core devs made HF proposals anyway.


Segwit is a 2MB blocksize, and it is a good compromise (some people don't want block size to increase at all). "Segwit2MB" is basically BS, it's actually "Segwit-4-8MB+HF", and both parts - the 4-8MB and the HF, are highly problematic, whereas segwit itself, a SF, with 2MB, isn't.

I don't blame you, because there's so much noise out there, but you've completely misunderstood the situation. The *only* claim in Greg's mail (which *wasn't* mentioning Bitmain by name), was that one manufacturer's hardware supported ASICboost, and that because the **covert** use of asicboost is blocked by segwit, it can give them a skewed incentive to block segwit so they can continue using it **covertly**. On the first point, it was categorically **confirmed** by Bitmain's own blog post supposedly "refuting" it! They said they had asicboost in the chips, and had tested them.
There is no evidence required *nor possible* that they *used* asicboost in the covert form on mainnet - because it's covert! And since there's no canonical transaction ordering you can't tell the difference between a block mined with covert asicboost and one without.

You're wrong in your assumptions (what you write is also non-sequitur but never mind, I get your point) because I understand the trade offs.
When I make a wire transfer, I don't expect or want it to be reversible. I want it to be a cash transfer, which is what they often pretend it is, but it actually isn't. I understand that there is a trade off - consumer protection means I don't own the money. That's fine for many, in many situations - but not for me. Before Bitcoin I never had that choice, now I do.
*My* logic is not flawed at all, but of course you're right in one sense - a large proportion of people are very ignorant about this and want to have their cake and eat it - perfect freedom to transfer along with perfect consumer protection.
A common mistake by many who are living in "normal" circumstances is they don't see just how hard it is if you're out of the norm. Recently I was in a position of having residence in one country, citizenship in another, banking in a third and occasionally on holiday in a fourth. The kinds of blockages that can be put in your way in these circumstances can be maddening. And god forbid you live in a country with capital controls, for example. None of this BS has anything to do with you personally, and yet you are *forced* to jump through endless hoops just to use your own money, and pay substantial fees for the privilege (and you don't have any choice but to use the banking system). Reflect on that for a moment.

I'm aware of that (not in as much detail as you, for sure). That doesn't mean it's as serious an issue as you claim; representing unbounded integers is not an insoluble problem (BigNum?), clearly. We wouldn't get far with RSA, for example, if it were :) - and in practice you wouldn't have to address it all in one anyway, so using sophisticated data types probably isn't necessary. Other blockchains have already implemented infinite inflation schedules (I'm thinking of Ethereum for example, but no matter).
If you think a different inflation schedule would have been a better design, that's fine. It's quite arguable.
Halving is not the only way. It could have been done as a linear reduction to achieve the same goal. (OK, technically, halving *might* be the simplest, but really, that's a trivial distinction. I think it was a conscious choice).

It's not highly speculative, and code has been written. See the Elements alpha sidechain.
The reason I say it's not highly speculative is because that was the main motivation of sidechains, you are correct: to enable innovation without risk to main chain.
You are also correct that the security mechanism is the gray/uncertain area: if you are only using it for experimentation, it doesn't matter that much. If you are using it for some business application where there is some kind trust relationship between entities, you can use a federated peg, like they are doing with Liquid; I wouldn't comment on that, I don't know the details.
There is also the idea of demurrage; I have idly wondered whether if a sidechain offered a really useful feature, people might pay miners some fixed fee per month to use it. That seems conceivable but I don't know if anyone's looked into it.
Merged mining is the other idea, but people don't seem to have a positive impression of that idea (too open to attack). I don't really know about that.

Please don't focus on "smoking gun" arguments. That will be a natural focus for casual readers, but it's entirely not the point. Covert use of asicboost isn't detectable, as long as it's done in a reasonable way. 
Focus on activating the proposal to block covert asicboost; then, whether they were previously doing it or not, any *potential* reason for blocking segwit is removed. If they refuse, everyone should be able to see that's unacceptable behaviour.

It's not true, the miners broke the agreement very shortly after it, by signalling/running Classic. Those core devs who are at the meeting only promised to make a HF proposal, which they did; they can't actually make a HF happen anyway, even if they wanted to.
And they are willing to compromise on on-chain capacity - segwit does precisely that, allowing ~2MB with today's transaction mix, and even more if it changes.

Not entirely true, especially nowadays: banks are very restrictive in allowing unusually large withdrawals in cash, and are also increasingly restrictive about sending money to things like Bitcoin exchanges. Ironically on that latter point, the very slowness of wire transfers is a disincentive to ransomers.
Genuine ownership has its downsides (as opposed to the nebulous IOUs offered by banks today); what I object to is not the banking system per se but the fact that you're not really allowed to opt out of it. If there were genuine free markets in banking it would revert to something that actually helps its customers - providing security for your wealth being one of the main services. It would still have its problems but it would be a service you could optionally make use of.

Fully support, would like to raise 3 points:
* A UASF is not "anti-miner" especially in this sense: miners should not be forced to take a political position; it is much better if they don't *have* to choose. If the community can reach sufficient consensus to do a UASF, the decision is not forced on them.
* I'd like us to do a UASF for the anti-covert-asicboost BIP, for the specific reason that it has zero reason to be contentious, with anyone (even someone who runs asicboost can do so overtly). I cannot see *one* reason why big economic nodes like, say, Coinbase, can be against this BIP. If we asked them and they said no it would be an outrage. With BIP148/segwit it's easier for them to point to evidence of controversy. Please consider this.
* We are being asked to reach out to communities, that's good. But bear in mind most of us do not have any influence at all. I'm not sure that I understand Core dev's position on stepping back, *specifically related to my point above* - with segwit it's more difficult, with anti-covert-asicboost there is again *zero* reason not to be for it.

This is just all wrong. Nobody thinks users should figure out fees for themselves (of course, they can if they want, but that is not for most people). Wallets can easily calculate the fee for them either by doing an rpc estimatefee N call or pinging off a server/API to get the same information. I know Electrum does this, Core does this, I would bet most of the commonly used wallets do. 
I have done 3 transactions today and seen no issues because my wallet(s) (including the one I wrote this fee estimation code for!) calculate the fee needed.

The reason it has to be difficult is to make it difficult to reverse history. If you use a simple hash taking micro/milliseconds to compute, someone can build a new version of the blockchain starting from, say, a few days ago, and how are peers on the network going to know which list of blocks is the "real" one? There isn't a "real" one, but with proof of work embedded into the hashes, there is an *objective* measurement of which version of history is "most real" - it's the one that's hardest to reproduce. (A useful intuition here - what makes digital things digital (apart from the obvious 0s and 1s) is the fact they're infinitely replicable at low cost - now you can see how dubious (even stupid) it is to call Bitcoin "virtual currency").

What has been called "Segwit+2MB" is actually "Segwit + a *hard fork* to 4-8MB". Segwit itself is already 2MB, and is a soft fork, which is therefore backwards compatible, a far more sensible thing to do. Segwit *is* the compromise.

The same reason any other change requires mass consensus - the proof of work algorithm.
But the subtlety that people never quite get is that **openness** is a key element of the security promise. Bitcoin works precisely because it does *not* use encryption, which means every transaction is verifiable by anyone at all, without permission restrictions - which in turn means that, even *if* sufficient mining power dictated an overwhelmingly unwanted change like an increase in coin supply, all participants would know about it immediately, and then simply fork the software to go back to the rules they actually want (not saying it wouldn't be a huge upset/tumult, but just saying it would not persist). Note how different this is from a private, controlled access system.

Your commentary in the post "Chinese have a tradition to create a new version of Internet. .. etc" is extremely annoying because there is a deadly serious point here, which you've ruined by talking about race/culture, as if the problem is uniquely Chinese.
The problem is that *miners* ,as miners, should have *absolutely no say whatsoever in protocol updates*.
It's not just a nicety, it's really necessary, as they have a massive conflict of interest in wanting to push protocol changes to make it harder for competitors to enter, thus establish a more and more firm monopoly. Finally, when that centralization effect is strong enough, and since they're easily identified, they will come under pressure from government, and will start removing privacy and replacing with KYC friendly protocol features.

That seems like a very strange thing to say? In particular, in environments without registered identity (but even with it).
Governance of ledger state is via PoW. That's basically Bitcoin's main idea. Governance of protocol updates - we only have the open source development process. Is it good enough? I think increasingly it will be very hard going forward, and I think the only hope for the longer term is to freeze the base layer so no more governance is needed; then people can innovate on higher layers without requiring consensus (and so not really requiring governance either - just like how if you don't like your current Linux distro you can fork it and make a new one).

I disagree, fairly strongly.
Mining in bitcoin is anonymous by design (of course not perfectly, but in principle). It *should* not matter at all where miners are; and if it were more decentralized, nobody would think much about it.
As for most exchange volume being in China, great, but that's of no interest really. A large churn of transactions helps liquidity, but it isn't actually important.
If Chinese developers want to get more involved in Bitcoin development and associated projects, I think that would be a great, healthy thing - but what would be even better is if people don't qualify and frame everything they do in terms of their ethnicity or country of birth...

Good for you Bruce.
I've long believed there is *no* reason to be having political discussions with *any* miner about *anything*.
Not that it isn't tempting. Not that it isn't convenient. But once the precedent is set that we have meetings with miners to talk about the protocol, it's not long before you end up with a situation like today, when ill formed tweets from someone with a large mining pool can cause earthquakes and massively move markets.
BIP9 signalling was just a convenience measure to help the process be coordinated safely, but the whole community has fallen for the idea that it's a vote, and it's a vote basically between about 4 people. We have to kill this by reasserting the fact that the users control the protocol ultimately, even though it's quite hard. Indeed, if there is a really big split amongst users, it should be hard! (hopefully, not even possible in that case)
We need to do a UASF, to reassert the precedent that miners *do not* decide protocol rules. Of course, it needs overwhelming support - and I think gmaxwell's latest anti-covert bip should be for anyone remotely sane. And probably in future, as long as mining is as centralized as it is, we need to have any and all upgrades follow the same procedure - a UASF approach first. Stephen Pair at Bitpay is behind this, now we just need lots of people with roles at economically significant entities, and also Core devs, to do the same.

I think this is a very important concept for people. I get that most people will never fully understand the intricacies of Lightning, but they should grasp its security model - you need to have the chain to fall back to, if you ever receive money (if you're only spending you don't risk anything).
If it's not (blockchain) synced you don't have that, and you can't really take an active decision to do something (in this case, force close).
Not that I am claiming you're automatically safe if you \*don't\* take an active decision to do something - but that's what delays are for; if you're not able to refer to a live blockchain right now, you need to be able to within a short time window (a day, a week, it depends how you have it set up).
If even that isn't possible, then make a trust tradeoff (someone else's node), or only send not receive (still very useful!), or just don't use it.

This is how P2SH was done, so no. Using hashrate to trigger soft forks was a convenience measure, but as the original mailing list post [discusses]( it has bad political side effects like we're seeing now (because people incorrectly read it as a vote).
@_date: 2017-04-08 05:41:28


A soft fork is making the rules *more* restrictive. That means that old clients will still see new (blocks, transactions) etc as valid. Thus it's backwards compatible. BIP141 segwit is a soft fork. This is not a debatable point, it's an absolute fact. Please don't spread out-and-out lies.


The current best estimates range from 1.7MB to 2.1MB as "what we're likely to get as an upper limit with the current transaction mix" (I think maybe it's more 2.1 from what I've read most recently). And considering that this could easily increase to 2.5MB + if the transaction mix changes, it's deeply misleading to say "it's 1.7MB".

First, I can give an example to show you why this *cannot* be 100% true: if all hashpower increased the block reward to 50BTC/block, the users would not follow. It would give them a lot more wealth relative to non-miner users, but it wouldn't work.
Second, despite what many will tell you, this is not what Satoshi intended - the line in the whitepaper that says 'new rules can be enforced using this mechanism' is referring to specifically *enforcement*, not decision of new protocol rules. New rules become part of the longest chain via that enforcement. Apart from that, PoW solves the transaction ordering problem, but it's not a voting mechanism on new rules. Satoshi never asked miners to vote on protocol changes, and that is not workable (especially the BU style "emergent consensus"), and if it was workable, it would be a disaster today, since essentially 1 or 2 people would then have full control of the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:26:17
I appreciate the technical stuff, but this is very wrong:


The protocol shouldn't have to be adjusted to fit the desires of miners. We can avoid making huge disruptions to them out of reasonableness and common sense, but even that is not necessary.


I'm sorry but it's complete nonsense to believe that segwit not allowing the block size to be set by miners is somehow a bug and not a feature! (actually if anything SW gives miners too much freedom on blocksize). This was the essential problem in the BU idea, you haven't "solved all problems" by putting that crap back in!
This just comes across as tremendous arrogance - that scaling problem? The one that's addressed by segwit but miners are blocking? We can solve it in a few weeks (and pretend that segwit doesn't exist and is well tested by the community, fuck that, we'll just throw it under the bus), oh, and we don't need to bother with peer review, we'll just announce it to Forbes, because we fixed it.
And then Poon gets butthurt that people are angry about it?

Just in case anyone else is having trouble like I was/am:
* ASICBOOST in its overt form (that's easily visible) is not being used by anyone. This was known already, by definition.
* The post clearly states that Bitmain have ASICBOOST in the chips.
* Trickier point:
If the chip supports the overt form, it *also* supports the covert form. I asked on IRC:


* The covert form (almost by definition? not 100% sure) is undetectable; so you can't know whether anyone's used it or not.
When you take these four points together, it paints a curious picture: they have ASICBOOST in the chip; they *claim* to have the Chinese patent; they claim not to be using it either in overt form (obviously true, see above), *nor* covert form.
That's where we are (ignoring all the odious stuff in the post).

Today's Bitcoin network is simply not economic for $5 payments. If miners had activated segwit months ago, as they were asked to, it *might* be today - but that's not really particularly relevant, in the case where transaction volume kept going up, a year later (just a guess) we'd be back to the same kind of fees. The difference with segwit is, we might already be looking at realistic Lightning implementations within that same time frame, which would allow genuine micropayments with microfees.
There is no realistic long term scenario where payments of a few dollars cost cents or less directly on chain, because *every* node on the network has to process them (long story short). Raw bitcoin does not scale up much more than where it is now, unless you want it to morph into paypal, but we already have paypal.
If you're keen that Bitcoin scales to a much larger user base with low fees, support segwit and be patient.
@_date: 2015-07-10 13:41:31


That's where we differ. For genuine news that occurs at one instant in time (and is propagated nowadays over the internet in seconds or less), the effect should be reflected in the market as a spike up/down (step function). The extent to which that is not true ought to be some dysfunction either in information propagation or in liquidity/access to the market.
I understand that there's a traditional association between illiquidity and non-smoothness of market moves, but that's a separate thing.

@_date: 2016-02-25 16:44:19
Yes, that's true, but it's a good problem to have; in that scenario, you'd have vastly more bitcoin transactions (including Lightning ones) than today, but the volume of published on-chain transactions would also increase over time (although they could in theory dip in an intervening period of transition). From that point of view, Lightning is a scaling improvement, not just an increase in scale - the latter is still a problem but other solutions might be found for that.

I hadn't read that Hal Finney quote but I came to exactly the same conclusion shortly after I discovered Bitcoin; its natural place is as a hard money layer, not a retail layer.
That was before I knew there was such a thing as a payment channel; that's even better than "Bitcoin banks" because there it removes the trust problem from any "caching layer" solution for scaling.
The biggest, most egregious error many people are making is thinking that there is a distinction between cash and settlement. Cash *is* settlement - it's the removal of counterparty risk.
@_date: 2019-04-30 11:48:04
First, thanks for explaining more, I think that's going to help.


I don't think that's right. I deliberately didn't pursue this in the blogpost except for an offhand comment about coordination, but I imagine you can avoid having everyone knowing the linkages using one of the existing techniques, for example coinshuffle (which is p2p) or the chaumian blinding thing (but that's server based), because ultimately you just need for the output destinations to magically "arrive" in everyone's possession and then as an individual participant you know which one pays you, and you just wait for at least one of the other payments to be broadcast on chain and publish yours. I haven't thought this through in detail, in case that wasn't obvious. I may be wrong.
(Ah, it just occurs to me, writing that out that "Alice passes a signature to Bob" doesn't fit with such a model, but I think Alice just broadcasting the signature to all (and obv noting which tx it applies to) should be fine.)
I'm very with you on the increasing timelocks being terrible,  think I mentioned it at the end, so I'm excited to follow a line of reasoning that might fix that.
But one thing, you keep mentioning Chaumian bank, are you talking about Chaumian tokens distinct from Bitcoins or only talking about Bitcoin swaps? I think the latter? But I'm confused about this still.

I don't know about hate, but the reason for the negative response is: the only hope of actual progress is segwit; it's tested thoroughly; it has a block size increase; it fixes malleability and opens the way for LN. We need to have *everyone* clearly and *unambiguously* backing it so that Jihan Wu and his coterie know they cannot take control of Bitcoin for their own ends and ignore the actual science any more.

I can see from the spend-outs of this address that it's using uncompressed pubkeys, which take up even more space. That combined with the very small outputs mean that you're going to be taking a big hit.
A lot depends on your patience level. If there is no rush, offer about 10%-25% of the "normal" fee your wallet is suggesting (sounds like around $300 from the description and the other comments). The weekends are often a good time for this. If it fails after a few days, you can try again. You can keep track of sites like  to see when fees are dropping.
If you're not patient you might have to eat a 10% fee.
Some people are suggesting splitting it into smaller transactions. I disagree. Generally, the more transactions you split it into, the *worse* it's going to be, although the difference is not huge. But perhaps one huge 800 input transaction might not be great (such a large transaction is a big chunk of a block). Perhaps try 1 or 2 tests before sending the rest.
The thing that needs to be understood unfortunately (as long as miners are blocking segwit for sure), is that there is a level below which a receipt of funds is uneconomical. That level's higher than it used to be.

Being able to use pruning with a wallet in a Bitcoin node seems like pretty good news (latest version). No longer do you need 60GB+ of disk space to do Bitcoin transaction in the best way (most trustless, most private).

Yes, zero confirmations is an acceptable level of security for small purchases (like a meal). At least, that is true today, perhaps not in an imagined future where everyone is using Bitcoin.
You can check the bitcoin network (e.g. using a block explorer) to see if the transaction has been propagated.
Payment processors (like Bitpay) allow the merchant to accept the transaction with zero confirmations like this (I believe it's configurable).
If you're spending $500+ then maybe not.

It's not true, the miners broke the agreement very shortly after it, by signalling/running Classic. Those core devs who are at the meeting only promised to make a HF proposal, which they did; they can't actually *make* a HF happen anyway, even if they wanted to.
Personally I *always* thought such meetings are a terrible idea whatever the outcome, miners should never be involved in deciding protocol upgrades, at least not *as miners* - of course they have as much right as anyone as users and holders, especially if they actually contribute to development somehow.

Interesting piece. I agree that (a) netting is a practical, desirable feature of a clearing system, and (b) a pure real time settlement system can exacerbate risks.
Debt "greases the wheels" but creates additional fragility. Pure, direct settlement (see "the trade is the settlement") avoids that fragility but is far less efficient. The core of the financial system should be ultra-redundant as you mention - not avoiding debt entirely but having very meaningful buffers.
I believe the reason the financial system has gravitated towards highly fragile forms is simply because it can (the central bank printing press). Too much power in the hands of people.

Yes, this is a big topic of discussion - your point is valid, but the counterpoint is also valid: if people don't know that the swap has occurred, it can be extremely difficult to identify it (see also payjoin, coinjoinxt and the idea of "steganographic" transactions, and there are tons of other examples, arguably even anything offchain like LN falls into the same bucket). And while that's a slightly unrealistic goal currently, it is very attractive because of (a) its magnifying effect - even 5% of transactions breaking blockchain analysis assumptions invisibly means the blockchain analyst's work is near impossible and (b) these hiding approaches tend to use a lot less blockchain space than the "open" approach with coinjoin fusing history.

I think it's more technically accurate to say that hardware wallets are probably the most secure way to *use* bitcoin, although even there there's a bunch of caveats.
Basically everyone who "stores" their bitcoin on a hardware wallet is actually storing it on paper (possibly in combination with memory); they have a backup seedphrase, that's the true backup, in case you lose the hardware device or it becomes inoperable. I was convinced a month or two after getting into bitcoin that a 12/24/whatever word seedphrase is the correct way to store/backup, I see no good alternatives yet. Hardware is just not reliable enough.

I absolutely disagree!
This misses the point the OP is making, whether the wording chosen is ideal or not. The point is that Wang Chun should not be in a position where his assessment of protocol upgrades, along with Jihan Wu's, is the final and *only* say. He may even have said something similar himself, as may have you I don't remember; that miners are forced into this political position is wrong.
And the suggestion that we need to just talk to people like Wang Chun is profoundly missing the point I'm afraid. You of all people know this - we've been patiently explaining all the reasons that the counterarguments against segwit are nonsensical for &gt; 1 year?
To keep talking to people like Wang Chun and Jihan Wu, after they arrogantly refuse to listen to the open source community of developers, or the users, is just disgusting, sorry. It's begging. I saw Charlie Shrem do that on Twitter yesterday.
What's more, talking to miners was **the exact starting point of this whole mess**. The Hong Kong agreement set up expectations that could not and should not be met amongst miners. Again, they not only believe they have a say, they believe they have the final say.

Note that your question is not about segwit, but about soft forks in general (we've already had a few go through successfully). Soft forks add further restrictions to what is valid. So backwards compatible because valid now =&gt; valid before, but not vice versa. To reverse soft forks is to relax restrictions on what is valid, and that is a hard fork; un-upgraded nodes see the new versions of blocks/txs as invalid.


A majority of users not upgrading is absolutely fine. If a majority, or even a minority of miners don't upgrade it's a problem - if miners disagree about whether segwit-containing blocks are valid, we can get a chain split. That's why BIP9 works the way it does (including why it's 95% - it's not a vote, just a coordination mechanism so everyone knows everyone else is ready).

OK, I'll write it out:
The use of asicboost per se is not "wrong". Forget about right/wrong. The problem is this: if it is used in the covert form, it is not compatible with segwit and many other intended soft forks. This means that, if you are using it in secret, and not admitting to it, you will be **very strongly** motivated to prevent segwit from happening (the reason for 'very strongly' is the economic points about profit margin that Andreas explains there).
Note how that does not apply if you are using it in the open ("overt asicboost").
The proposal is to simply prevent the ability to use covert asicboost. That's it. Nothing else, no judgements, no prevention of asicboost, no assumptions about whether and who has been using it already.
By preventing specifically covert asicboost, we remove any mal-incentive to block soft fork protocol upgrades. Miners may still have other reasons to block them, that's a different discussion.
Is it clear now? There is exactly zero rational reason to not support the blocking of covert asicboost.

Personally I'd start with the [whitepaper]( then get familiar with the mechanics of using Bitcoin. Download Bitcoin Core and/or play with a lightweight wallet like Electrum (which is quite fully featured nowadays, but only in terms of spending money, it doesn't of course let you interact with the underlying network like Core does). You can use the information at the [Bitcoin Developer Guide]( and the [Bitcoin wiki]( to start playing around with things like: how a raw transaction is structured, how to create/spend a multisig, using rpc calls to query your node. There are open source libraries in javascript and many other languages that give you ways to interact. A lot of code out there.
As for books, I only know of "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopolous; haven't read it myself, but it is also open source.
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:23:42
First, segwit *does* raise the block size - it approximately doubles it. Second, the problem with "just raise the block size" is that it requires a hard fork - this is something where *every* bitcoin user must upgrade at the same time, very hard to coordinate, and is probably too risky if a lot of users don't agree about it. Segwit is a soft fork, meaning it doesn't matter if you don't upgrade now, everything will still work as normal, and you can upgrade later.
Segwit has other scalability improvements as well as the doubling of block size, and the ability to create LN.
It's a "no-brainer" which is why more than a year ago the developers started working on it, put it through a huge amount of testing and it's been ready for months. The problem is one or two very large miners in China are blocking it. That's the only reason we don't have bigger blocks, and LN on bitcoin today.

Use the mnemonic seed phrases of 12 or 24 randomly chosen words from a fixed dictionary (see Electrum, and BIP39 which came later). It is easy to make a story which uses those words as 'waypoints' which the brain naturally and easily remembers.
And while it's easy to remember, it easily gives you 128+ bits of protection from proper randomness.

Coinffeine's solution to the conundrum of fiat-crypto decentralization is interesting. It seems to me they have come closer to making *trustless* fiat-crypto trading, but not so much *decentralized* - at least not yet.
Basically the way to solve the unsolvable is to cheat somehow. Bitcoin cheated in "solving" the Byzantine Generals problem, but it worked. Coinffeine's solution to the apparently intractable game theoretic problem was to assume that fiat could be made to behave like crypto (and indeed crypto-crypto decentralised trade is a more-or-less solved problem). They found a way to make a fast fiat micropayments channel with zero or low fees. The tradeoff was that they had to find a specific provider that would give them that, and it is (so far) OKPay. To use OKPay, from my investigations, you have to have a verified account with them (except maybe for very small amounts?). 
I wonder if it'll get much traction. Most people don't really want to use OKPay, don't want to give them ID details etc. It's noticeable that not much localbitcoins trade is done over OKPay. Could we get other payment services offering something similar? That would help with the decentralization, but it's the same old story: the only thing stopping businesses from offering cheap, frictionless instant digital transfer of money is the same good old regulation that makes trading via banks such a pain.

I *think* you've misunderstood - the email goes on to explain how you can get round this inefficiency (left/right side of tree). But with the new segwit structure, this left/right split won't work (because witness commitment commits to all of the tree, something like that), so this trick to get round the above inefficiency no longer works.
Having said all that, there may be some extra incentive to mine empty blocks (I think I read that somewhere, again, not sure), but the covert asicboost trick doesn't depend on doing so. I'm pretty sure about that last statement.

OK, I'll try one more time.
*Covert* means it can't be detected. For example, they reorder the transactions in the block they're trying to mine in lots of ways. When the block is finally found and broadcast, *it is entirely indistinguishable from a block which didn't use covert asicboost*. Do you see?
However, on the point of whether the chips have asicboost at all, **which is the only thing he was claiming** - they admitted it themselves. It is a public fact, not something in dispute.
There is nothing else to prove. Perhaps someone else can try explaining?

I don't disagree that UASF requires big coordination. But like Stephen Pair (Bitpay) was saying recently, it's actually unfair on the miners, as well as all the other reasons, to have them pick sides politically. Somehow we need to get a UASF style approach to work so the miners can follow it.


Sure, that's a given, but between mass letters from exchanges and realistic node counts and developer consensus, it's clear that in BU v Segwit, segwit is the overwhelming winner. If you want to do Segwit vs status quo I'm pretty sure segwit wins, but it's not unreasonable to argue inertia -&gt; status quo, and some people do (I think it's madness not to support the scalability improvements in segwit, and every argument I've heard is just incoherent nonsense; note that the people behind extblk are not arguing against it either, they're just arguing that miners won't allow it, see above on that).


Working on alt. solutions is, I agree, more than OK, but laudable! The reason I get so upset is by the *way* it was done, combined with snide attacks on the open source bitcoin project, and combined with a media blast. Of course even with those aspects, they have a right to do it, but don't expect people not to be really upset, because it's a shitty way of doing things.

What's not contentious is that 2MB is a reasonable compromise.
The "debate" is between people advocating for a backwards-compatible solution with 2MB block size (and higher), real scalability improvements and the ability to create technology like Lightning providing real scalability, and people proposing that because "Core is evil" we need a hard fork (not backwards compatible) and huge blocks shown by academic studies not to be safe, no scalability improvements, no malleability fix.
Apparently the choice is not obvious.
@_date: 2017-04-03 08:55:21
It's complete drivel. We have had this argument for over a year, again and again, from every single idiot "Bitcoin celebrity". A controversial hard fork is a terrible idea, just awful - not because a hard fork is inconceivable per se, but because we have a real scaling path available, today (3 months ago in fact), that already includes a ~2MB block size, via soft fork.
Not to mention that "segwit+2MB" is a bullshit name; it actually means ~4MB max block size with the potential for 8MB in some cases. But those kind of factual details are uninteresting to politicians.

Just for clarification: it's using asicboost *in the covert form* that is incompatible with many soft forks - specifically ones that make commitments in the coinbase transaction (the one with the block reward). This includes segwit, but there are also others.
So it's this horrible combination: covert, meaning undetectable, and *huge* financial incentive to keep doing it because of the profit it gives, and incompatibility with segwit and other upgrades. *That's* what needs to be blocked/stopped, nothing else (so, we don't need to block overt asicboost, although some people would like to do that too).
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:03:40
Yes, this is a point of discussion, *but* I actually think it's better to do it as a UASF to establish the precedent and to avoid forcing miners to make political decisions all the time - and this particular decision is ultra-political to them, because it's specifically about how mining is allowed to be done.
@_date: 2017-04-06 11:06:46


I understand your general sentiment, but basically this is arguing that protocol upgrades (not only segwit - there are several others to which this applies) should be blocked to avoid affecting miner optimisations. This is the wrong way round - mining exists to serve the bitcoin network, to allow transactions to occur securely - bitcoin transactions don't exist to serve miners!
So, that's theory, in practice, it's hardly a good idea to unnecessarily wreck miners' businesses by randomly altering the way the PoW hashing is structured (edit: unless doing exactly that is widely agreed in advance, perhaps), but the current scenario under discussion - covertly optimising to gain advantage, then blocking vitally important protocol upgrades with false reasons to preserve that advantage, is not acceptable.

Ability to do overt asicboost = ability to do covert asicboost. So there's nothing to prove, other than what is already admitted - the chip supports asicboost.
All this noise about proof is just muddying the water - Greg's BIP simply is a proposal to prevent covert mode working, so there will no misaligned incentives. Nobody sane can disagree this is a good thing; even miners can go ahead and use overt mode if they want to.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:33:36
The basic idea of a UASF is not voting, certainly not with nodes. It's figuring out in advance that the economic majority are in support, and then going ahead, knowing that miners will achieve nothing mining coins on a rogue chain if nobody accepts those coins.
But it's clear that it's more difficult than miner activated soft forking (as per BIP9) to figure out that the economic majority is in support.
@_date: 2017-04-25 10:32:59


That's not exactly correct, it's more like "4MB definitely isn't safe now, lower figures may be OK".
And segwit provides 2MB with the possibility of it increasing to 3MB-ish depending on transaction mix, and does it with a *soft fork*, which is much less disruptive. In other words, this is an argument for segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:37:13
Unfortunately that's not the situation. The reason the term "covert ASICBOOST" was coined, is because it's not detectable. I mean it might be in some special cases, but in general it isn't (consider, the underlying primitive is a hash function, the whole point of which is to have preimage resistance). What the post *does* confirm, which had not previously been confirmed, is that the chips support ASICBOOST, and if they support *overt* they also support *covert*.
@_date: 2017-04-11 04:39:41


Setting aside the debate about Chinese culture, whether "cheating" is going on is a huge distraction from the real issue. The real issue is that the use of *covert* asicboost is blocked by many protocol upgrades, including segwit. This gives a massive financial incentive to any miner that has asicboost on their chips, to block such protocol upgrades.
That's why Greg Maxwell's BIP explicitly does not block all use of asicboost, it sets aside any question about whether asicboost should be allowed, it only blocks covert asicboost.
All these arguments about "cheating", "optimization", "evidence", "reverse engineering" - they're all irrelevant (reverse engineering is irrelevant because they already have explicitly said that asicboost is on their chip. "Evidence" is irrelevant because you can't prove they used covert asicboost).
I'm very disappointed that people are not able to focus on the simple, unambiguous fact that **covert asicboost should be blocked, there is zero reason not to.**
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:13:45
I agree with . I strongly prefer to do a UASF of covertasicboost first, because it *cannot* be controversial, even to the kind of people that were equivocating about segwit before. Example: Brian Armstrong at Coinbase. If they did not support this it would be an outrage.
Once that precedent has been set, then either (a) it will not be necessary to do UASF again for BIP148 because miners would just signal segwit according to BIP9, or (b) because of the precedent, we know exactly the steps that need to be taken to make BIP148 happen.
So in that, i disagree with , although his POV is not unreasonable. I just think mine is more practically what can happen.

Users shouldn't have to, it should be up to the wallet software - it should offer a "reasonable default" which allows confirmation in the next 2 or 3 blocks at worst, and a configuration that allows a user to give higher or lower priority (usually based on -estimatetxfee somewhere down in the technical plumbing, including polling an API if there is no other way to get up to date data).
@_date: 2016-09-05 06:02:15
I don't see how it's relevant. "Emission" is not zero for a century, so either you consider the reward after 5 more epochs significant or you instead characterize it as 'tail emission', either way we aren't at zero until next century.


The opposite; the more that's lost, the larger any fixed reward size is.
It's economically more logical to have mining paid for by transaction fees; printing money out of thin air, as is done now, is just a necessary evil to kickstart the system (because the supply has to arrive in the system somehow, and things like "airdrops" fundamentally don't work).

It's possible not to "leak" the info. I clarified on IRC, and indeed: it would be possible to make it *effectively* undetectable, in that it would not be distinguishable from normal behaviour like miners prioritising transactions.


Totally disagree here; his email/BIP was showing a real problem/vulnerability that exists; he didn't call out a specific miner as using it, and he *did not* propose to "block asicboost" - it's specifically about preventing a scenario where miners are *incented* to block protocol upgrades - they can still use the overt form.

This is fairly bad too. Is segwit one of the scaling proposals they think is poor quality? I suspect not, but the casual reader will for sure assume so. "Core's social relations"?

This is (of course) the root of the problem. Bitcoin is not, and never was a consumer payments network, so that the above promise can never be fulfilled in any scenario where usage is above microscopic. Just because fantasists like Roger Ver kept saying that it was, doesn't make it so.
Bitcoin is a hard money layer **on which a consumer payments network could be built**. There are *at least* two plausible ways to go about it today: a Lightning network or similar approach, or a completely trusted model where a business uses Bitcoin as a mechanism only for withdrawals and deposits to the payment network system that they control. You could even consider that a spectrum; somewhere in the middle of the spectrum is a hub and spoke with payment channels but no routing/Lightning.
Some people, instead of taking a positive part and trying to build such solutions, will instead continue to attack Bitcoin as they have been doing for years (and failing repeatedly, often rather comically - see the Segwit2X "launch"), trying to force it into a centralized model, but they will continue to fail to do so. They will probably dupe some unfortunate ill-informed people into thinking a low grade copy without the strong security of Bitcoin, is in fact Bitcoin, which is shameful, but apparently they're not big on shame and integrity. Witness the complete lack of apology for Segwit2X's total failure and waste of everyone's time.

The answer to your title is "They're not".
Virwox is catastrophically expensive, I think because it allows credit cards (not sure). And there are other expensive options like some bitcoin ATMs. Localbitcoins wouldn't be as expensive, but still can be quite expensive depending on various factors.
Normal exchanges wouldn't cost you more than 1-2% I think. But you have to set up an account. 
But, also, buying amounts &lt; $50 is usually going to be a bad deal (exception would be where you have an established relnship with an exchange; that usually lets you buy in small increments like that).

No, it is not democracy. Bitcoin is about replacing trust with verification, not about replacing trust in a central institution with trust in a group.
(Btw if you want a democratic form of money, you probably just want to reform our current central bank based system, e.g. to put the central banks under direct control of the legislature - very interesting to note that this is not the case today, and in some countries it was recently changed specificially to give the central bank independence from the legislature and therefore electorate).

The argument for software as distinct from other engineering disciplines didn't seem convincing to me at all.
I think the main point of the article seems to be that the incentives in the crowdfund-based model are poorly aligned, with excessive focus going into the initial speculative fizzle. I agree, but on the other hand it's not really different from the pink sheets/OTC market. 99% of them are basically scams too. I personally am OK with that existing, I don't see a good reason for governments to make that kind of speculation illegal. The problem with "let's have the government regulate away snake oil salesmen" idea is that it leads to things like "qualified investor" (= only rich people are allowed to invest in something), plus like with any other financial regulation, the regulator becomes a point of fragility and a focus for corruption - and this is not an abstruse point, e.g. see the actions of the *government-mandated* ratings agencies pre-2008.
By the way the IPO market has historically been a horribly corrupt shit-show too, and if you think it's bad in America, take a look at how it works in China. Plenty of "regulation" (=backhanders) there too.
But my perspective is unusual and I know most people don't agree with it. I think even outright fraud (specifically lying to get investors, e.g. Onecoin, not actual stealing) should not be illegal either. I think the happy medium is "fraud is not illegal but there is a market for auditors" instead of an enforced global auditor (which always ends up obscenely corrupted because it's enforced).

I think it would be more accurate to say *most* economists have a strongly negative opinion of it. What's really shocking is how poor their arguments against it are. An example: Bitcoin is a bad form of money because it has too much volatility in its value/price.
This is a dreadful argument because: Bitcoin was a far worse money in 2011 than it is in 2016, since its value was more volatile, and what's more there were far fewer things you could buy with it. So since it has improved in that sense, they are only really pointing out that is getting better as a form of money.
They have plenty of other "insightful" explanations about why Bitcoin is bad, most of it is similarly lacking in any depth or sophistication.

The point is to be able to verify the blockchain yourself, as well as to be able to interact with the network directly (e.g. broadcast transactions). You perhaps misunderstood "unreachable" as "disconnected", but really it just means not *receiving* connections.

I was really impressed by the paper, I think this is a great piece of work.
Reading the roadmap, I wonder if phase 1 (the 3 parts of which make sense for sure) would result, at the end of it, in a viable server for a "classic tumbler" mode of operation? If that isn't the priority of the project, perhaps some people can push it forwards as a kind of sub-project?

I am not here to argue pro-in person retail transactions (generally not very practical, for now), but: 1/ there are no fees for the merchant 2/ like cash, the merchant gets the funds cleared immediately unlike with credit cards where the payment is not finalized for a long time 3/ the customer does not compromise any credentials in making the payment (it has been quipped in the past that a credit card is a like a cryptocurrency where you give the merchant your private key).
Mostly the advantages, such as they are, are because it's cash-like, and cash works better for that purpose, at least today. (Not that cash doesn't have disadvantages, but that's another discussion).

You shouldn't run Joinmarket with mainnet coins via a VPS, because that would mean signing transactions on a machine you don't control. (There is a "create-unsigned-tx.py" script that allows creating a coinjoin unsigned transaction which you can then transfer and sign and broadcast elsewhere (side-side note: there's a rather complex issue right now if you try to use that with a hardware wallet, it's possible but complicated.))
Re your other questions, there are no general answers, only to say that because risk is very low (only the risk of running a hot wallet), you cannot reasonably expect big rewards. Low like 1-2% per annum low. Most people won't bother (unless it's made much easier, and even then).

It's not possible, in general. There is no canonical ordering of transactions in blocks; miners can do it how they like. So you cannot tell if I ordered them that way "just because" or "because covert asic boost" or "funny economic reasons I don't want to tell you".

Bitcoin still absolutely does not compete in physical retail payments. I've been complaining about people trying to promote it for years (it's counterproductive).
BUT that *might* change in future; with a L2 style thing (Lightning) it could compete on several fronts:
* price
* removing the fraud worry for merchants
* better privacy for customer
* universality (can't be blocked)
But so many things have to line up for that to work.
For now, it can be an interesting option in certain niches within *online* payment. It already has been for years, but it was set back in that area partly by the fee spike last year, but more fundamentally due to difficulties around the fact that confirmation time is too long (even next block can take 1 hour) so you have to come up with weird workarounds ("assessing the likelihood of a fraudulent double spend", it was never going to work at scale like that, but Bitpay and Coinbase somehow convinced themselves otherwise).
Of course other blockchains (e.g. Ethereum) claim "confirmation" in 15 seconds; unfortunately it has been known for payments to literally disappear when the network is at high traffic, so that's not quite "optimal" either. L2 is the only way to go, so some hybrid of LN, or trusted third parties, or best, the option for either depending on the customer's wishes.

While I agree that there is excessive aggressiveness sometimes, what you probably don't appreciate it is the extent to which **a huge swathe of prominent actors (many of them CEOs of businesses, some others) have been waging an all out attack against the open source project Bitcoin** for years. I know superficially that sounds like an extreme statement but it isn't. You just have to look at the history in detail. XT, Classic, Unlimited, Segwit2X, Bcash; all of them are actual attacks against the open source governance of Bitcoin. For example almost the entirety of 2017 featured a lack of segwit, which represented a hugely helpful block size increase to reduce scaling issues, because these players wanted to take control and force their shitty version of "scaling" (not scaling at all). Only because the users stood up to them and told them where to get off did we avoid what would have effectively been a corporate takeover (see "New York Agreement").
This attack is ongoing, it hasn't stopped, many or all of them are pushing BCash, even though all the stats indicate a less than 10% support of it amongst users.
None of us started off being negative about these companies (for example, Bitpay); we were either supporters or we thought they didn't really matter much. That changed.
The problem is, their incentives are not aligned with what Bitcoin actually represents. Exchanges gain from having a plethora of coins to trade (who can blame them for that, it's not like there's something immoral about altcoins), that's a minor aspect, a more significant one is that payment processors want cheap and fast payments above any other feature; because they literally have no business model with slow and expensive payments. The problem is "cheap and fast" was never the selling point of Bitcoin, even if a whole parade of idiots thought so going back many, many years. The selling point was censorship resistance; Bitcoin is a hard money layer; SWIFT not Starbucks points. And cheap, fast payments have to be layer 2 not the base layer because it's broadcast (everyone verifies everything) on the base layer. So layer 2 can mean something like Lightning or it can mean some trusted third party based system. That's where payment companies should have been focusing for years, instead they want the easy route of having huge blocks, zero fees and huge centralization pressure in mining, undermining the whole point of the system.

It doesn't mean anything because (a) large orgs, especially exchanges, hold large funds on behalf of thousands of people, so 1 address can represent a lot of people and (b) the opposite is also true: 1 person can control multiple addresses.
So "concentration by address" doesn't actually tell you anything at all about concentration by person.

Btw there is no "3MB limit for witness signatures", there's a single 4M limit for weight, where weight is calculated as 4*non-witness-bytes + witness bytes.
If you could construct a block entirely made of witness bytes (not possible, but you can get close-ish with fancily constructed transactions), then it would be 4MB, entirely witness.

It's not true that small businesses will try to avoid cash based business. In many cases they would prefer it.
If you go to many countries outside America/Europe you will *very often* see "cards not accepted" signs in small businesses. The fraud cost is substantial and is borne by the merchant. There have been laws passed in places like America forcing businesses to accept cards at the same price as cash, whereas some time in the past a surcharge was often added for credit cards, because of the fraud risk.

Recent figures i saw on p2sh.info were around 12-15% i think. Segwit is obviously much faster than p2sh itself was, and for obvious reasons. My guess is it may well continue at this or slightly higher rate for a couple of months, and even at 10-15% the effect of ameliorating backlog periods is going to be very noticeable. After that we have the 2X attack and anything is possible.

bitcoin.com (Roger Ver's attack site) is actively promoting bcash as the real Bitcoin.
They tried to promote it as "Bitcoin Cash" and put it on various websites as if it were equivalent, tons of people have lost their money by getting confused between the two, both due to the name conflict and the use of identical address formats (again, not an engineering error, but because they are trying to pretend it's actually Bitcoin).
They removed segwit thus making it deliberately vulnerable to malleability attacks.
I won't even mention the details about the proven fraudster Craig Wright supporting it.
All the developers, like we're literally talking hundreds, of Bitcoin do not support it. They have like 1 or 2 developers capable of maintaining it.
90% of the hashpower doesn't mine it now; but its active promotion by its creators (Jihan Wu and Bitmain) caused massive hashpower instability during the end of last year and exacerbated fee problems. Note that Jihan basically owns the SHA256 asic market (at least, he did up till recently), so that 10% figure is much more embarrassing than it may appear.
By intensive social media, broadcast media and internet campaigns they managed to convince a lot of hapless people to buy into it at high prices because they thought "hey maybe it is the real Bitcoin, and it's super cheap!".
There's lots more that could be said, they are scamming less informed people, and they have caused massive disruption to everyone.

Because it's not by decree. You are required by decree to use your local fiat currency to pay taxes, moreover you are required by decree to accept it as payment of debts (that's usually how it works; each countries' laws differ of course). You are not required, with implicit threat of violence, to use Bitcoin. Even Krugman understands this perfectly well - "fiat is backed by men with guns".

Really sad seeing the comments here from people that are proud and happy not to be using cash. Once all payments are going over the networks of private corporations they will have *total* control over you. They can be hacked and lose your private data to thieves; the government can force negative interest rates of any size to force you to spend money; most important of all, your life can be totally destroyed if someone in a position of power doesn't like what you say or do, by blocking your payments.
Perhaps when LN or similar is more in general use we might be able to get convenience without someone else having control of our money; more generally, the very *existence* of Bitcoin might be enough to keep the panopticon dystopia out of reach. But given the way people "think" (i.e. don't) about this issue, I'm not really that hopeful.

I've seen more than one person say this recently, let's not get confused: the effective saving for a typical tx might be 30-35% (might be wrong something in that ballpark) when shifting to p2sh segwit, *all other things being equal*. It could be more like 50% if you're using more exotic transactions. But the "all other things being equal" part matters; you didn't get your 1 sat/b tx cleared magically because of segwit, but because there was no backlog.

One "solution" is already no longer available: have people paying you pay to different addresses. Good Bitcoin privacy practice starts with this: don't reuse addresses. Receive each payment to a different address. There is software that makes this possible, but it depends on details. And it's not a complete panacea, it's better to see it as the first step.
Recovering privacy is harder. Simple obfuscation can help a lot (a series or network of transfers makes it difficult for anyone observing to have any surety that all the owners are the same, mostly they will not be able to make that assumption at all). Coinjoin takes that idea further by creating transactions where there is more than one owner of the inputs.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:19:41

If you want a  serious answer, yes: what lit the blue touchpaper was wikileaks (and I believe Ross Ullbricht started the silk road concept shortly after that); *those* are the applications that bootstrapped bitcoin.

Right, although i wouldn't put it quite like that; using it can give extra features, but it's more expensive than non-p2sh pre-segwit, so most wallets didn't makeit the default setting (or in some cases, use it at all). With segwit that's reversed.
@_date: 2018-03-26 09:08:38
To everyone saying "segwit": it's really just a part of the story, especially today. (And I'm not downplaying it because of bias, I've been campaigning on this sub and other places for segwit for years now).
It's actually hard to pin down any 1 exact reason, but between December and today there has been a huge drop off in the number of transactions used in Bitcoin per day. It could be (a) big users (exchanges etc.) getting smarter and aggregating transactions (b) much less speculators/crowds of people trying to move bitcoins around, i.e. just naturally less people using it and (c) people were spamming the network with fake transactions to bump fees or push a political agenda.
Probably more a, b; c is possible but kinda hard to prove it happened.
Is segwit irrelevant then? No, certainly not. We have had a broad range of blocks of size &gt; 1.5MB, even quite a lot &gt; 2MB, i.e. actually much larger blocks, which does actually mean that some of the time, blocks contained a lot more transactions than they could have contained before segwit. Even today when we don't have any backlog, we still get bursts of traffic and get blocks in the &gt; 1MB range. 1MB has become irrelevant in fact, if you look at a time-series of block sizes you'll just see it varying all over the place. This is great.
Transactions are essentially free today. It may well not last, because segwit increases the max throughput but only by a factor of *roughly* 2, so if there's a surge in future we may see a robust fee market develop again.
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:29:01


The actual capacity increase is ~ double, not 0.5% ; it's just that users have not yet chosen to upgrade. In particular, big exchanges and some wallets that are in broad use have quite surprisingly not yet made the upgrade.
I agree that 10% in a couple of months looks reasonable today; but I don't think 30% is unrealistic, either, if large scale users can bother to make the effort (I mean, they've only had since early 2016!). And should we get to around 30% I very much doubt fees are any kind of issue at all, for a while, until more usage slowly appears.

Not really. It depends exactly what you're doing. I wrote a blog post about the different types of swaps [here](
TLDR is if you don't care about privacy (i.e. you're ok with the two txs being 100% linkable) you can do a safe coin swap without segwit. Segwit is needed for pre-signed backouts, which a "raw" swap doesn't need.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:53:39


To expand on this: the reason Bulletproofs cannot be built on unconditionally sound elgamal commitments is because they use what are called "vector Pedersen commitments", which basically means committing not to a single number, but to a whole list of them. That's a huge part of what makes them so compact, but precisely this compression rules out the possibility of building them in an unconditionally sound way (crudely, if you compress, you destroy information, so you can't assert that there's no other possible opening of the commitment).
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:37:24
Basically because the inner product proof on which the proofs are based uses a kind of "recursion" which requires that you do a sequence of halvings of the size (length) of the vectors, until you end up with just 1 scalar (vector length 1). So it works only for vectors whose lengths are powers of 2.
I mean trivially you could just pad out to a power of 2, but that'd be pointless since we're trying to make it as compact as possible. I know did look at non-power-of-2 versions but I can't remember exactly the latest status on it.
The thing to bear in mind is that the length is O(log(n)) where n is the number of bits, so it's a very small increase in size to go from 32 bits to 64 bits. ISTR the formula is 4 curve points + 5 scalars + 2\*log(n) curve points (just for 1 proof of course, aggregated is different).
(Probably not relevant to OP, but for others: In case you're wondering what on earth vectors have to do with anything, basically the value is encoded as a vector of bits and that is inner-producted with a vector of powers of 2, which gives the value. Well that's just the start but anyway).

The post implies that privacy in atomic swaps requires MAST, this is not the case.
The reason I am harping on this point is that there's been a ton of confused "omg atomic swaps" stuff out there recently which makes zero sense since we've had what's required for that for ages (it *doesn't* need segwit). However, segwit itself (without MAST) *does* provide what's needed for coin swaps with privacy. So it's unfortunate that this post furthers that confusion; people now think it needs  MAST which it doesn't, and one *can* argue (it's very arguable) that it's better not to use MAST for that purpose since one has to consider anonymity set (yes, yes, I know the counterargument: with MAST one can munge everything into the same anonymity set - that'd be great but MAST isn't available yet, let alone adopted).

Agreed that the exact manner of replay protection is the most important issue here, but once you have that solved, **precisely and only because both sides of the fork have segwit**, the protocol is embarrassingly simple; it was laid out in Appendix B from [McCorry/Heilman/Miller]( see Table 5, it's basically just as you outline here.

Yes those kind of approaches make sense (mobile for small amounts, laptop/PC for intermediate, offline cold for savings/large amounts). Of course you can just have 2 layers rather than 3, also.
There are tons of variants. I like seedphrase on paper as deeper backup, as you suggest. I don't like the paper wallet where a piece of paper corresponds to a single private key, that's less easy to manage without making a mistake. A hardware wallet (e.g. trezor, ledger) is a very nice idea for medium level, because it combines a high degree of protection against malware through signing on device (and checking address), with some ease of use and mobility that you don't get with a separate not-connected computer.
There are other approaches like using a live USB OS instance in RAM only for recovering from a seedphrase (slightly less secure than never-connected-to-internet hardware, but worth considering as another option).

It's a lie of a name; segwit already has an effective max block size of ~2MB (today, yes, we have that rough limit, even though we've only seen largest blocks at about 1.35MB; the capacity is there if people choose to use it), and a theoretical max near 4MB. This proposal changes that 2/4 to 4/8.
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:06:51
I'd guess this summarizes the situation nicely.
If you write your own transactions, it's not so hard to migrate to segwit. I'd expect most wallets and anyone else writing such code, already did it some time ago, it's just a question of how to move it into production if you're a big service.
But a lot of bitcoin-using services (exchanges, gambling stuff like the above) really just use things like Bitcoin Core. They have their own code of course, but they're farming out the business of actually making bitcoin transactions to this back-end code. And so as described above, it means it's not *trivial* to migrate to segwit via a simple change in an RPC call. This is probably a big factor slowing down adoption by the larger users of block space.
Having said that I am very disappointed to receive '1' addresses to make my payments to on any service today; large, professional outfits handling thousands of users should have been able to figure out how to get this in place. Not only was segwit in process since early 2016 (did they do work on segnet in 2016? I did), but it's been quite obvious since sometime around June that segwit was going to activate (and almost certainly in August).
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:22:19
Correct, and I've always thought that the people saying "Bitcoin is anti-fragile" haven't really thought it through. There are sound reasons to argue it's robust, but anti-fragile?

Absolute nonsense. In 10 minutes of reading the first public information about Wright's claim (late 2015), I knew it was rubbish. So did most people I knew. The only curveball was Gavin Andresen's incredibly embarrassing bamboozling (oh yes, let's verify a signature *in private*, great idea!), which he never admitted to, which shows really poor character on his part.
Then shortly after, there were two independent cases of him using cryptographic keys to "prove" in public that he was Satoshi, both of which were exposed as 100%, unambiguous fraud. (Arguably a third, particularly amusing: he promised, in public, to pay back some BBC journalist with early coins and then didn't). Then he said he would never speak in public again, shortly before going on another massive publicity drive, of course. Because he's a liar.
As for the "Kleiman connection" (which most people in this thread seem entirely unaware has been hashed and rehashed in great detail over a year ago), since the fraudster Wright is the only one to ever make any connection to him, there is no evidence of his involvement either (and plenty of sound reasons to think it ridiculous to claim he was in any way involved).

Your comparison of Bitcoin with Visa energy consumption is completely wrong, here's why:
First, Bitcoin is a currency whereas Visa is a payment system on top of a currency, let's say USD for simplicity. USD's energy requirements are mainly coming from the massive military-industrial complex needed to support it. Even just the US military itself consumes *hundreds of billions* in funding a year; it's a huge consumer of resources; it blows Bitcoin into the dust.
(It seems less obvious today than it would have in say 1960, but yes, what I am saying above is very much the case - the value of the currency is a consequence specifically of the military power. The US was the real winner of WWII, even though the other allies nominally won too, they were reduced to near basket cases (in England they had to ration food a few years later). Things like aircraft carriers and nuclear weapons are the "proof of work" that demonstrates in an easy to verify and hard to forge way, the ability to dominate any challengers. You cannot control the printing press for the world without this.)
Visa as a company is far less relevant, although it does require resources of course; but it should be compared with a payments network on *top* of the currency Bitcoin, e.g. Lightning. Lightning consumes nothing, basically how much does it cost to feed :) (Edit: jokes aside that comparison is still no good as Lightning alone is not enough for a consumer payments system imo, you need permissioned layers for ordinary people so reversals are possible; but this debate is completely separate from Bitcoin, which is a currency not a consumer payments system).
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:46:49


Not the case actually; there is no really solid evidence of Satoshi holding that many coins (the 1M often quoted); there was an analysis done by Sergio Lerner but it's a matter of some debate. It's also the case that it seems reasonable that a large number of the coins mined in, say, the first half of 2009 were Satoshi, but that's not the same thing as solid evidence. About the only thing we can reasonably assume is that a few of the first blocks must be Satoshis (such as the one he used to pay Hal Finney the first test transaction, and the genesis of course).

Yes, the seed is converted into a master private key (a Bitcoin private key), from which all of the addresses can be recovered.

This is not the case (at all), it's a misunderstanding being promoted by people with an agenda.
The signature goes into the witness section *of the transaction*; it's still in the transaction, and in the block that the transaction gets mined in. It's just located in a separate portion *of the transaction* which allows us to create transaction identifiers ("txids") that don't change if the signature changes (when you broadcast a transaction, it's possible, due to a mathematical property of ECDSA,  for someone on the network to change the signature **without making it invalid**, this is what's called "transaction malleability" and is a major pain for some more complex Bitcoin uses).
(For an extra detail, it's *also* possible to "malleate" the portion of the Bitcoin *script* that authorises the transaction, not just the ECDSA signature itself. But this is getting really technical; the above is enough to get the important points).
@_date: 2015-04-12 07:08:11
Agreed in general.
The one comment I've probably made more on this sub than any other is that Bitcoin is digital *cash*. The general population and media in particular have not got the memo; they think Bitcoin is "virtual currency", which is all the more terrible a category name because fiat itself is "virtual currency", while Bitcoin is emphatically not (it cannot be created at will).
So Bitcoin is cash and is therefore a possible antidote to the cashless society which is just one more way those in power will get an even more unfair advantage. (To be clear: of course there are advantages in not dealing with physical notes and coins, which is why this is even a conversation).

You fail to understand Satoshi's intent entirely when you say "Satoshi probably acquired his views on computing..." The Bitcoin project has absolutely zero to do with Satoshi's views on computing, and everything to do with his views on how to make digital cash *actually work* (probably in the context of the cypherpunk vision that was elucidated mostly in the early 90s, but that's more uncertain).

Clearly not. It has value because it has properties that make it a near-ideal money. I heard the following analogy: imagine there was a road that could transport you to any country on Earth without having to pass through any border checks, without any sea or rough terrain. Such a road (Bitcoin network) would clearly have a lot of value to some people, and they would therefore be willing to pay for the tokens (bitcoins) to be allowed to use the road.
Bitcoin also could be said to have non-monetary value in creating the most reliable notary service on Earth; for some particular minimum number of satoshis you can enter a hash into the blockchain which irreversibly and incontrovertibly proves the existence of data.


The environmental damage caused by proof of work is miniscule, not even measurable, compared to the environmental damage caused by "proof of violence", which is what backs fiat currencies. I won't explain in detail to you why that's true, I'll just note that even Paul Krugman admits it to be the case.

Even worse, I made retail payments via both of them recently with segwit, paying low fees which I knew would confirm quickly; they paid out of those outputs with ~500 sat/byte fee (when 50-100 would be more than enough), non segwit of course. I don't know if they were cpfp or just internal transactions. I'm not sure but I think by this, they are/were making fee estimation algorithms worse for everyone, as well as not helping the network scale by not using segwit. (To be fair, Core's fee estimation algorithm was also really not helping during that period, failing to fall in response to market change).

What I saw as wrong was this:


That's not right; you can't trace it back to "some" block reward; there could be an extremely large number of block rewards potentially contributing to the final utxo. As a matter of principle, it's better to consider that the coins that are spent in inputs are wiped out and new ones created, because there isn't any ultimate truth in saying *which* of the original mined blocks actually contributed.
Example: 
Which input does the 1m2 output correspond to? It is likely (but far from certain) that one of the inputs is owned also by the owner of the 1m2 output, but you don't know which one. The best you could do is say that the 1m2 output is tainted by each (perhaps equally?), then trace the origin of all 3 inputs, and so on back in time, leading to a fanning out. There are all kinds of ways you might be able to narrow it down, but none of them are ultimate. You're going to get a huge number of block minings that *potentially* had some influence on that output.
(Sorry, probably overkill, TLDR: it's not "some block").

The fact that you're keeping track of it for taxes doesn't alter iwilcox's point; there is almost *never* a good reason to import private keys instead of transferring the coin in a transaction. Wallets like Electrum are designed to keep the money under the control of the seed (via deterministic/hierarchical deterministic).
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:37:41


There is "only one blockchain" after a few confirmations. If you thought that wasn't true, you're welcome to try to generate an alternative with root at the Satoshi genesis block and show it to the world. The reason you can't is because you don't have an unfeasibly large computational resource to do so. Orphans and alternate chains of course exist, but they're negligible because the rule is "the chain with the largest embedded proof of work" (note that this not the same as a "longest chain rule" - an important detail). 
All of this is predicated on the assumption of the attacker not having more power than the rest of the network.

Yes, they can and should offer all those services for the currency bitcoin. If they try to use a blockchain to offer those services for an existing currency, they will gain nothing (and likely lose) compared with using a simple database (with some distribution/ redundancy/ replication/ failover whatever).

No, you will not. You cannot define deterministically one particularly block which is the origin of any particular utxo, because there will be many potential such blocks, this being a direct consequence of the many-many design of a transaction (specifically, a consequence of the fact that inputs can be, and very often are, multiple).

In my opinion, that negates the purpose of a hot wallet; it's for convenience. Should people carry around two phones? I wonder did you mean to write 'cold'? Or, perhaps you meant use a hardware wallet for spending?


Or use a wallet that is deterministic and therefore doesn't require unreliable and inconvenient backups (e.g. : Electrum).

The point is that if the unit of account is not internal to the Blockchain, then it requires some form of trust to enforce the distribution. Satoshi referenced this in one of the few posts where he discussed his design decisions. He said that he couldn't see any other way it could work.
Of course you can have a "blockchain" without an internal incentive for mining. Guess what,  you just reinvented the Merkle tree, which is actually just an optimised linked list. What these empty suits actually mean when they say "the blockchain is a revolutionary technology" is "the linked list is a revolutionary technology", which is a lot more moronic than they intend to sound.
A distributed database with high availability among trusted parties is an already known and understood technology, and Bitcoin or "blockchains" are irrelevant, mostly.
If you want the real value that Bitcoin provides - the replacement of trust with cryptographic proof (yes, that's right, it's *not* just distributed trust like everyone thinks - it's replacing trust with proof) - you need a decentralized incentive mechanism.

* small amounts (2btc over 6 months might be OK for that, but I wouldn't want to do more than a few hundred dollars worth at once, personally).
* counterparties with some good feedback/reputation
* immediately back out if they mention anything even tangentially related to illegality, or ask questions about your money or offer any information other than the most obvious, general information, about their own money (in this case, cash). This is because law enforcement are actively engaged in trying to do stings, however: this is super-unlikely for small amounts, but still.
* get one of those bill checking devices
* use the localbitcoins escrow system so the coins get transferred immediately, no waiting around
* if you've taken reasonable precautions and dealing in small amounts, don't get crazy paranoid, enjoy it. It's interesting to do these kind of trades. Especially if you do repeat trades (it often happens) - you'll be able to have interesting conversations with other Bitcoiners you wouldn't otherwise meet.

A digital signature is sufficient for solving this problem.

The really interesting question is why this isn't being done already - which is part of the larger interesting question of why basically *no one* is using digital signatures (organizations or people) despite the obvious and quite enormous advantages.
The blockchain is a bit of a distraction here (one could argue it's completely irrelevant). The required technology is the digital signature.

I do agree but, speaking as a total outsider, I think it's as well to remember that the organization was originally conceived, from what I read Charlie Shrem as saying, as a business organization (like a trade guild I suppose). You could easily imagine that the nascent Bitcoin businesses saw value in clubbing together to achieve certain goals. Thought about that way, I don't see anything wrong with the basic concept. But it hooked itself into Bitcoin core development, by the apparently laudable goal of funding developers.
What's fascinating, though, is the nature of funding: I believe that many of the Foundation contributors do so precisely because they see it as a status and networking opportunity (complete conjecture, but it feels right) within Bitcoin as an "industry". Now that it seems that the political side of the Foundation's role is crumbling, it's also likely to fail in funding core development. So it's as if the political side of the organization failing, due to inevitable controversy, will also scupper the more altruistic technical side.

3600 btc is produced each day; that is inflation, indeed, in the sense of money printing. It's currently worth a bit less than $1M, yes.
Whether $1M "needs to be burned" is a tricky point. The obvious statement: even if miners' goal was to maintain the price of bitcoin at $X (it isn't), they can't achieve that goal through mining.
Bitcoin's inflation schedule (50 btc per 10 min for 4 years, 25 for the next 4 etc) was set in advance from day one. According to the efficient market hypothesis, it shouldn't have any effect on price. Many people (almost everyone it seems) are keen to point out they believe the efficient market hypothesis is wrong, but it's a base case that one should consider; I see it as much like natural selection - given only very trivial assumptions it is close to a logical necessity. So if you share my perspective, the inflation doesn't really matter because it's already known.
Note the difference to fiat - nobody knows how many dollars are going to be printed next year, and even more so 10 years out.

No, it's exactly correct. There is no such thing as "a bitcoin". All there is spent and unspent transaction outputs. If Bitcoin only allowed transactions with one input, then the history of a particular unspent output would be determinable; even though it might have a long history, that history could traced exactly. Since Bitcoin in fact allows many inputs and many outputs, you never know which of the inputs was actually intended to spend to a particular output. You can define all *possible* origins of a utxo, but that's not the same as knowing its actual origins, and in the limit of large transaction graphs this becomes exponentially more important. In particular, see the idea of "coinjoin", which is not an addon to the Bitcoin protocol, but a consequence of its many-many design.

Yes, it should always be borne in mind that a reasonable baseline model is to assume that an event which is not just predictable but more or less deterministic, like a halving, ought to be priced into the market from the start, so really shouldn't impact the price at all. Admittedly this is a "baseline model" (efficient market hypothesis) and you can come up with counterarguments, but I would have trouble believing them. It's true we had a huge bull market around the first halving of BTC, but correlation is not causation.

What is described in the paper does work - a *cash* system with irreversible full settlement after about an hour, and with fees that are determined by the market.
The problem is only people's projections - what they want is an instant and free version of the above. That cannot exist for both physical and economic reasons (although, hey, let's not lose sight of the fact that it still *is* very cheap today and will probably remain so for some time).
I used to think we would eventually get "Bitcoin banks" - further developments of Coinbase type entities, which are better than the current system only in that the auditing mechanisms are vastly superior. They could even print money in the same way as current banks do (issuing loans).
 But with the development in micropayment channels (Lightning) we could come a lot closer to having our cake and eating it - very fast and very near free without trust in a bank-like institution, as well as always having the settlement layer to fall back on if you're willing to pay for it (in time or dollars or both). It won't be perfect of course. The key point is not how the layers develop, but that we keep the base layer impartial, which means decentralization. We can build graduated levels of centralization on top of decentralized, but not the other way round.

You can't really say that anonymity was one of its core purposes; the whitepaper definitely doesn't claim this. It describes a different privacy model, using the term pseudonymity.
There is a *lot* you can do to keep your transactions private, starting with not reusing addresses; not to mention CoinJoin (usable now for the tech savvy, see Joinmarket for example) and potentially Confidential Transactions in the future (which is addressing a different aspect, but could be even more significant).
The whole area continues to need more work but it's not the blocking factor to the average person using Bitcoin.
The core purpose was having full control over your own financial transactions, so you can't be blocked from making a transfer, along with not having your money being debased.

(About: actual uses of Bitcoin as money, not future possibilities)
One of the first usages was to pay Wikileaks, which is an interesting thing to consider.
The first big usage was the dark web (esp. drugs of course).
Other big uses are:
gambling and trading (different? :) )
computing services: VPN, VPS
extortion (as you mention)
crowdfunding projects (dubious in some ways, but quite big), and related, donations for causes a la Wikileaks
uses which exist but aren't very big:
remittance (always a grey area, because Bitcoin's role in the process varies)
tipping (for content, or just for fun - e.g. a lot of podcasts have bitcoin addresses for donations)
charity 
W.r.t. retail/mass market consumer: this hasn't taken off, but it's far from zero. Computer goods, hotels and flights, a few big companies, especially Overstock, a bunch of much smaller merchants.
I'm sure I missed some big ones :)

AFAIK the scenario "automatically liquidated" is far more common in retail trading (stocks, forex, whatever) than a request to post additional margin.

@_date: 2015-09-25 11:04:07
How does that work? You don't need permission to send Bitcoin, and no one can stop the transfer taking place. How does this help capital controls again?
The only way what you're saying can make any sense is if the network gets centralized in such a way that taking control of mining power enables this kind of control. But then, Bitcoin would no longer be Bitcoin and it would either die out completely or change to another coin/model/blockchain whatever, and thereby regain permissionlessness. If your scenario is that you believe people would be happy with that kind of permissioned/controlled version of Bitcoin, then it would become pointless - just go back to a centralized system which is more efficient. Bitcoin is *defined* by its permissionless aspect.

A few things worth remembering in this context:
1. Satoshi was really upset when Wikileaks decided to use Bitcoin for donations (see the famous "hornet's nest" quote).
2. Edward Snowden, as far as I know, has never mentioned Bitcoin (?). I can see why he wouldn't choose to do so, even if he liked the idea of Bitcoin, because he doesn't want his message tarnished with money. 
3. Note that the Ed Snowden address was set up by Wikileaks.
Funny thing is, the ability to pay Wikileaks with BTC was one of a set of things that really launched it into the mainstream imagination.

Like your podcast (although haven't listened to this one yet).
IMO it's not about marketing or PR. Gold was not universally seen as money for thousands of years because it had a good PR dept. Nor was its use by criminals a fatal blow to its "success".
Bitcoin isn't a product to be marketed, and it's not owned by any business. I think marketing it is actually counterproductive, because it confuses people who are used to being sold a product, and think it fits in that category. Moreover they get suspicious, rightly, because .. "if this is actually money, why is someone trying to sell it to me? Nobody tries to market Euros to me!"

Although your points about transferring dollars are generally valid, do people really expect 100 to be 100? When I use Paypal, I don't; they charge a fee (on one side or other) of all kinds of transactions in and out. When I use a bank transfer, I also don't expect zero fees. I do understand there are pockets of free and (notionally) immediate transactions if you live in a privileged geographical region and are privileged financially, perhaps.

I don't understand why anyone would be upset at the "no one is really using it" part of the article. It's obviously true that what the media was getting excited about in 2013 - basically the 'pay for coffee with Bitcoin' scenario, has not gained traction. At least not for now.
The other bits of the article were fairly interesting. 
The thing that I *did* find a bit annoying was the idea that the local government had decided to record something on a blockchain, but they were using some little blockchain that nobody's heard of (for all I know it's one of those "private blockchains" which would be even more idiotic).
@_date: 2015-09-18 18:21:39


Not really. We only have a chance by sticking together. It needs to cost a *lot* to attack the chain. The idea that the BofE, or any UK govt institution, has the wits to attempt to take control of Bitcoin in any sense is laughable. Chinese or American govt, or both: maybe not so ridiculous (although still somewhat tinfoil territory today).
Consider the extreme: 10k different crypto blockchains. Every one that's added reduces the value of the total since it (a) makes a nonsense of digital scarcity and (b) makes any one individual chain too easy to destroy, thus removing security.
Digital currency is not like other open source software projects: we cannot just fork all the time whenever we feel like it and not lose anything. The ledger is global consensus. You can have 50 different Linuces and Linux gets stronger. Not so with Bitcoin.
(Note that a reduction to "there should be always and forever exactly one blockchain" is the other extreme, and not realistic I suspect; more like a power law distribution, so that 1 is dominant, a few others are somewhat relevant and the rest merely curiosities. That's exactly what's happening).

I think you overstate your argument. Clearly the absence of the private keys on your own computer removes *some* attack scenarios, even if one could fairly argue that they are by far not the most likely ones.
Btw it may also remove the most common way people lose coins: simply losing (accidental deletions, hardware failures etc.) the private key.
Disclaimer: I don't use hosted wallets and don't particularly recommend it either, especially not if you feel more than a passing interest in tech and can handle a little bit of configuration. Plus we are all a bit better off if people don't concentrate control of all the bitcoin in a few hands.

That's really quite arbitrary; "decent". Neither the value of 1 bitcoin, nor the difficulty of mining are fixed. Simple example: in 2010 I'm sure nobody considered a ~~25~~ 50 bitcoin reward particularly "decent" when bitcoins were less than $1.
We have no idea what 12.5 bitcoins will be worth in real terms in 2019. If it turns out to be very low (compared to today) then it's a reasonable assumption that the hashing power will fall (people will be less incented to spend energy on mining bitcoins). If it turns out to be very high compared to today, then in effect the reward might have increased rather than decreased. So you can't really say what the situation will be in 10 years, and indeed 10 years is an entirely arbitrary cutoff, the reward schedule continues for many decades after that.
@_date: 2015-04-30 07:42:49
Article's 404ing, but I wonder if they have this concept at all: just a slider that you can set from 0-100, where 100 means fully BTC and 0 means totally USD, i.e. not exposed to BTC volatility at all. What I like about this idea is an ordinary user would accept the default, which would be zero, but still gain the benefits of bitcoin transfers (in theory! they have to trust Circle or whoever). But anyone who, for any reason, wanted exposure to bitcoin can do so without taking uncomfortable risk. They can set it to 5/100 or perhaps 10, so that if Bitcoin drops 20% one month, they just lose 1 or 2%, which brings it within the band of normal currency fluctuation and you wouldn't really notice (btw the Euro has dropped a lot more than that in a month recently).
I know that that description is nothing novel, but I feel like *that's* the user interface which would make ordinary people comfortable, and still able to participate in using Bitcoin.

then you should have been even more nervous before LN was a thing.
Bitcoin doesn't scale to 100k+ transactions per second, obviously, unless you torture it into an unrecognizable form, in which case, VISA already exists. Moreover, Bitcoin doesn't support instant transactions (and no, this isn't solved by having 20 second block times, not even close).
But I never saw all this as a reason to be nervous. It was always the case that Bitcoin transactions would have to be off-chain *somehow* in any success scenario. That we now have well elucidated mechnisms for off-chain to be trustless is fantastic, even if there do turn out to be some limitations.

The government cannot dictate the properties of gold, similarly it cannot be allowed to dictate the properties of Bitcoin. So Bitcoin must be engineered in such a way that that is true (and, it was).

Layer 2 doesn't have to be centralized.

Curious why you're saying that if, in your scenario, the user is using autopilot, so channels have already been set up in the background?
On the general high level view, the big positive differences will be just the obvious ones, no "waiting for confirmation:", no concerns about fees (for ordinary retail style transactions they will be zero effectively). The UI will be simpler due to not having to represent the issue of "unconfirmed".

I find this extremely bizarre. A hypothetically secure PoS system is a perfect crystallization of the concept of a "rentier class". Isn't it enough that landowners leech value off the rest of society for doing nothing? You want holders of money to have the same privilege? So rich people literally get paid for being rich?
Arguments of "oh we have that in PoW anyway" are completely specious. Just like in mining gold and in many other businesses, there can be temporary quasi-monopolies, sure, but even while those last, you still have to work hard and keep beating out the competition. And in general, they don't last. PoS is ethically disgusting; you need to do absolutely nothing to beat out the competition, just sit there accumulating more and more money.

Your fee should depend on the kB size of your transaction, and your wallet should figure this out for you, but 12k satoshis is relatively small nowadays even for a small kB size transaction - the link you quoted suggests 22k satoshis for a small (220byte) transaction. Edit: meh, it's not that low, just on the lower side; *if* it's a small transaction of 220 bytes ish; if it's more like 500 bytes it'll definitely be slow to confirm.

Typical size transactions aren't paying 40c now I think; a couple of transactions I paid yesterday: first 370 bytes 2000 sats, which is around 16c, second 370 bytes 900 sats, i.e. around 8 cents. Note that many wallets produce transactions much smaller (around 220-250 bytes). And these fees were not required, you can certainly go lower.

OK, so you are considering mining which does not include distribution, but if mining (whether pos/pow) doesn't involve distribution, are you imagining similar to the long run of bitcoin with transaction fees as incentives? in that case it's back to the same story w.r.t. the ethics of "distribution", just in this case distribution is not coin minting but tx fees. Or are you imagining block mining without any financial incentive at all? That's a radically different kind of system (e.g. fees still for DOS res. but go not to miner but to everyone or to no one, or random, whatever).
(And distribution remains an extremely hard problem to address without mining, but happy to put that aside as a different problem)

Schnorr sigs can help because multiple signatures can be aggregated into 1. It's a kind of witchcraft where a single 64 byte (say) value can act as a N of N multisignature; currently in Bitcoin that has to be encoded as basically (sig1 sig2 .. sigN); each of the 'sig_x' values is ~73 bytes so it gets very large very quickly.
The lack of such witchcraft in ecdsa is kind of a consequence of the patent on Schnorr, which is why the latter wasn't used much in industry (or Bitcoin) before. ecdsa has this horrible k^-1 (modular inverse term) which messes up the algebra and makes neat tricks like the above impossible. And there are other reasons it's much better, e.g. it has some kind of solid security proof (although never looked into it personally, but it's intuitive because algebraically more elegant).
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:35:13


No, that's not right; 1 in 2 out is about 225 bytes:
 ~= 34\*2 + 147\*1 + 10 (approximate because sig sizes vary)
I guess you mixed up 1 in 2 out with 1 in 1 out.

I disagree, it directly addresses fungibility since it make the "history" of a utxo increasingly meaningless.
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:36:01
I think the question should rather be posed in the opposite direction.
Here's what I mean: consider a simple transaction with 2 inputs and 2 outputs, where all 4 have value 1 btc. This is very artificial but it explains the point. There is no way, even in principle, to assign inputs to outputs. Output 1 is fundamentally not "from" input 1 or input 2, and nothing on the blockchain can make that mapping. So transactions are a "many-many mapping", all input utxos are 'destroyed' and new utxos (outputs) are created. ('destroyed' in quotes because the data's still there of course; just means no longer spendable).
This is what I mean when I always say to people "bitcoin has a fundamental fungibility"; that is not to say it has good fungibility, it's to say that this property is fundamental.
Now, there is a ton of academic work already looking at how to trace coins on the blockchain. It probably starts with Sarah Meiklejohn's paper, which lists a couple of very logical heuristics you can use to make assumptions about common ownership (that's basically what a blockchain analyst is trying to do; associate different utxos and claim with some very high probability or certainty that they are co-owned); for example Heuristic 1 is that we can reasonably assume that all inputs are co-owned because that's mostly how Bitcoin software works and the alternative is difficult to arrange. Heuristic 2 is iirc about change amounts.
But let's stick with Heuristic 1 :) The same assumption is made in Satoshi's whitepaper and he states it even more boldly, almost as a fact, which is just false. [Coinjoin]( is simply a description of a procedure to make it false.
Most existing software for 'clustering', i.e. associating addresses as being under common ownership, is based on Heuristic 1 first, and then uses other data (and there is a lot of metadata you can get hold of!) to expand on and improve that, *as I understand*. But this kind of approach is completely busted by coinjoin. It will basically end up with very large groupings of addresses where actually there are a large number of people all being put into the same bucket - due to the erroneous application of Heuristic 1.
In Joinmarket specifically, there is an algorithm called "tumbler" which addresses the weakness of just "oh let's do one transaction where coins are joined and we're done". That is indeed weak for all kinds of reasons. Tumbler tries to address timing correlation and amount correlation. It was somewhat inspired by the description of a "Clos network" approach as outlined in the Coinjoin link above. You can read more about the tumbler algorithm [here]( and [here](
Lastly, bear in mind that there is nearly no one for whom there's an incentive to say anything good about this approach. People running Bitcoin competitors of course will point out the negatives, and of course they'll have a very good point. Blockchain analysis companies will of course brag that they can trace anything, that's their business model (just like IT security companies). That doesn't mean they're wrong. But Coinjoin is kind of fundamental in Bitcoin, as I tried to explain in the early part of this. Later tech like Schnorr interacts with it in very interesting ways, and that's even more true for Confidential Transactions.
Also we're still waiting for someone to trace the final destinations of [these]( coins (read the comments).
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:53:02
Yes, not that I know, but I have seen a lot of people coming on  on freenode and having problems like this over the last couple of years, Core devs often point them at hardware failure as the cause; Bitcoin places much higher demands on hardware than almost any other application, so even if you think your hardware's fine because it seems to run correctly for everything else, it may not be fine.
@_date: 2015-04-12 09:42:56


Indeed there is a single "the blockchain" within Bitcoin; that is the point of proof of work. Double spend vulnerability, after a few confirmations, is essentially zero, except where an attacker gains more than 50% computational power; this is clearly explained in the whitepaper.
(Edit: referring to your second comment, thought they were in a thread)

Great, couple of questions:
Are there any other reasonable ideas about fees other than the use of sighash_single with other utxos? I guess that's OK but I worry about watermarking and also maybe it's slightly awkward?
Do I understand from 5.2 correctly that you could have huge numbers of people in the channel together if and when we get Schnorr aggregation? Limited only really by how much interaction and computation would be required for the musig (or whatever it's called nowadays) process? Guess it doesn't exactly replace HTLC given they'd all have to interact, but it makes you wonder what interesting use cases there might be for high-N-party channels.

It is one of many protocols one can use to make coinjoin work. The comment you make above *does* apply to coinjoin itself, which is just multi-participant bitcoin (coinjoin is not an add-on to the Bitcoin protocol itself).

Would he say the same of the printing press, which helped bring about huge social change (civil war, revolutions, rejection of church authority)? End to end encryption, DHT file sharing, bitcoin - these are all "flattening" technologies. Government agencies can use e2e encryption, but so can I and so can anybody, which changes the balance of power.
These are very smart people who haven't fully grokked bitcoin, partly because to do so you need to go quite deep technically.

What a ridiculous mischaracterisation. Proof of work is not comparable to a normal cryptographic signature, as you well know. The whole point is how to create the effect of a signature in the absence of fixed identities.
Systems that use identities require trust, and so do not have *that* expense. But they have others. And systems based on identities can be censored and shut down. Bitcoin wouldn't have got past its 2nd birthday if it weren't for the fact that it was designed with *exactly that threat* in mind.

Fwiw they never went after Taaki for darkwallet (he only got "done" for fighting in Syria) and I don't think or I have seen any repercussions for just writing coinjoin software that people actually use - at least, not yet.
The general meme out there is that "blockchain analysis traces everything". The real struggle is to get anyone to believe there's any point doing coinjoin style privacy stuff. Although it's true that a lot of prominent devs are *very* paranoid about getting involved - one very prominent dev that I won't name responded with "oh is that a dirty money laundering thing?", only *half*-jokingly, when I mentioned Joinmarket to him - most people outside our small circle generally believe that chainalysis companies see everything. I have second hand info that very strongly leads me to believe that they aren't on top of coinjoin at all, but it seems it suits everyone's interest to just assume that they are.

Not in an absolute sense. The reason something like FDIC insurance can work even in a catastrophic scenario (technically, it's supposed to be funded, but..) is that they can simply print money. See 2008 (although that was for the banker class, not the people). You can't print a million lost BTC.

Right, I think this is the heart of the problem: people build business models around Bitcoin with the tacit assumption that it should just always work with low or infinitesimal fees. That is sloppy, wishful thinking: scaling up to much larger user base is not a trivial problem, just bumping the block size is not a solution since it has seriously negative consequences for the security model.
@_date: 2015-03-27 12:56:59
Well, debatable really. Closed minded here *could* be interpreted as "assume everything's a scam until proven otherwise".

Umm, in that exact post he points out that it's already implemented. What you mean presumably is that its' not on mainnet. Well, doing that would be extremely difficult, best I think is if we get the necessary changes in for a two-way peg to a CT sidechain. I hope a plan like that exists.
Fungibility is not as simple as people think. Are Euros fungible? They have serial numbers, and yet they are largely fungible.
Bitcoin has a very deep kind of fungibility achieved by not existing :) A bitcoin transaction is a many-many mapping so, contrary to popular belief, there is no single historical path back in time for a particular utxo.
Most interestingly, your scenario wouldn't really change with CT - because CT doesn't hide the transaction graph, only the amounts.
How do we make bitcoin fungible? Make coinjoin the default behaviour. Don't reuse addresses. CT will help with fungibility too (somewhat - but it's much more about privacy), but that isn't something people can do today.

Yes, I know (as in heard: I heard your explanations on various podcasts). Fully with you on that. I think we have a lot of people that are in love with technological innovation, a lot of them were Bitcoin early adopters, and good for them, innovation is great. But communication protocols, and money which is one such, are a different beast. We need a stable base. I am really hoping that Bitcoin itself can ossify reasonably fast from here.

I really doubt it got that far. I think the reason it's so weird is just because they want to force the hard fork to happen (not to allow segwit to happen without it), while at the same time knowing they couldn't realistically force it first. Hence this mess with different signalling bits, but seems maybe they really didn't understand the technicalities well enough (see Greg Maxwell's comment on it).

One of the biggest misunderstandings all along has been this phrase "Be your own bank." It is simply the **wrong** slogan for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is digital cash and digital gold - it's money without counterparty risk, 100% ownership. That is *not* what banks provide - banks provide literally everything else except that! (At a deeper level, it's hardly even true that banks "secure" your money; they just remember it - there's nothing to secure, because fiat is truly virtual currency, in a way that Bitcoin is not).
So you can think of it as cash, or as a settlement system - indeed, 'cashing out' is the most basic form of final settlement.
The problem, such as it is, with a cash-only financial system, is that you don't get take-backs. Which is of course the whole point! As I put it on bitcointalk some time ago:






And recent developments (Lightning) may allow layers that are not trust based, but that's a slightly different issue - people *do* want trust based services for some of their financial requirements. Most perhaps? We just don't want to be locked into a profoundly (inevitably) corrupt system where the government controls the money, and the banks. The ideal form of money is controlled by nobody at all.

That's irrelevant. The point is that there is nothing special about the 8th halving. The data you link shows that in 2036, 99.6% has been mined. 
The 2140(ish) halving *is* special, because it's when the reward drops below 1 satoshi and so gets rounded down to literally zero.

Yes, absolutely correct: but it's also true that once rumours of Greek insolvency spread around, there were stories also of other Europeans wanting to reject notes which were issued by the Greek central bank. Point is, without the law enforcing it, the fungibility would be really quite weak, but even with it, the fungibility is not perfect.
I suppose it's not a very interesting observation, now I think about it. Fiat currency literally is by definition currency defined as such by law, so it's nearly tautological to say that fiat currency fungibility depends on law.

Bitcoin *main chain* never was; Andreas A was always wrong about that, in my view he thinks too much as a utopian. Specifically, he's wrong about "other 6 billion first" being like, people in very poor countries; that's just fantasy, mapping from say mpesa to this is completely wrong precisely because it's decentralised and not owned by anyone. Bitcoin's real version of the "other 6 billion" is the huge black and grey markets, although it seems like a complicated picture and "adoption" outside a few dark net drug markets and online gambling seems to be quite limited.
Long term, the idea that the main chain, even if capacity is increased by a few multiples, can be cheap, is completely bizarre; how else do you propose the network decides which 4MB of the potential 500GB of transactions should go into the block for this 10 minutes? Remember - no identities allowed, so you can't ban anyone!
This is why Lightning and payment channels matters, even if it's not a panacea, and is still a fair way off. In the absence of that I always assumed transactions would move to off-chain trusted intermediaries, now it appears they may not have to.

 still exists; I believe the original author moved to working with one of those well-funded blockchain analysis companies (Elliptic is one, forgot the name of the other).
Basic idea there is to create wallet closures based on common inputs. This is heuristic 1 in Meiklejohn's original paper (and also based on the only unambiguously incorrect statement in the bitcoin whitepaper) - you assume that all inputs to any transaction are owned by the same party.
Coinjoin breaks that assumption, although there are tons of other "blockchain analysis" vectors like timing correlation, amount correlation, network level ~~spying~~ sorry, "analysis" :)

Rubbish. The "best case" if you only care about size of blocks is far higher than 1.7 (estimates vary from 1.7-2.1MB with *today's* transaction mix, but it can easily go much higher, 2.5MB-3MB say .. theoretically it can go close to 4MB but not realistically).
It's also rubbish in suggesting that everyone needs to switch to get the benefit. They don't. If 30% switch, the realistic block size limit goes up by only a smallish amount, but the benefit of that is shared by *all* users, not only by those who have switched, in the sense that more capacity is now freed up for old-style transactions.


Also 100% false as explained.

I don't know, quite probably not. But the idea that people will *hate* this idea, I find a bit bizarre.

"Transparency for the powerful, privacy for the weak" - Julian Assange (or he was quoting someone else).

I had a primitive [integration]( into Electrum working back in April/May. A couple of people tested it, it was working as in able to do individual transactions, but had to re-focus on defending against the snooping attack starting around June time. That was a very big, and disruptive, change. Planning to go back into looking at some refactoring work, and then probably if that works out, go back to the Electrum plugin. took a serious look, around the same time, into a more serious integration with Core, also, but I'd let him update on that as I didn't look at it yet.
Apart from the need for refactoring - basically better isolation of components, which I think is quite needed for wallets to somehow interface to Joinmarket, there are other things to consider - some primitive signing/ECC operations might not be feasible for a wallet to do without some shenanigans. Of course, there is absolutely no need for an external piece of software to link in any way to our code, they just have to implement the same [protocol]( which they could do, if issues like the above (ECC related) were overcome. Note that [joinparty]( has already made a stab at doing that, it works with libbitcoin, although of course that's not what's being mentioned here, it's not an existing wallet, but still.
It's important though that we can all talk over the same messaging substrate; at the moment we are running on 2 independent IRC servers, but it should be very easy to implement, simultaneously, talking over other message channels (in the joinmarket code just make a new implementation of the abstract class MessageChannel).

No, only the segwit side is saying "Segwit is already the compromise", and the reason they're saying it is because it's true. Segwit doubles the blocksize, and without a hard fork. Passive non-updated participants, or those who don't like it for irrational reasons, don't have to use it.

An analogy from an IRC convo:
Nov 03 23:37:37 &lt;gmaxwell&gt;      glumpy`: the worlds courts can handle a few thousand cases per day (say); how is it possible then that millions of business transactions as secured by the potential for recourse to the courts?
["as secured" = "are secured"]
 (some more clarifying discussion...)
   
Nov 03 23:46:21 &lt;gmaxwell&gt;      so perhaps "The answer is that we conduct our business arrangements so that if something goes wrong we can take the evidence to the courts and get made whole. The same can be done for Bitcoin with the Bitcoin network acting as the court, just by constructing our transactions in a smart way."
You can get much faster, much cheaper transactions this way, knowing that at any stage you can fall back to the main network. The analogy is of course limited, since evidence presented to human courts is often ambiguous, but evidence here is cryptographic and the court executes its decisions automatically ("smart contract").

"should"? Maybe transactions should be free, but "should" has no bearing on the actual engineering reality.
One could also say, fees for such a system "should" be sub-cent; and indeed they will be for certain classes of transactions, once Lightning is implemented. Miners are blocking that future from becoming reality.

I think there's a significant failure of social signalling here.
A UASF will never get off the ground without some clear signal from a broad swathe of respected developers that **they agree with the idea in principle**.
Instead, posts like this, which seem entirely correct literally, are pushing for caution. There isn't any need for caution *now*, because there is zero chance of any UASF as long as the above is not in place.
Same goes for 's recent mailing list post. What matters is the headline, and the headline is "I do not support BIP148", which is basically read as "No to UASF for now".
The only dev who's engaged in any remotely positive way is Get behind the idea, categorically, in principle. **Then** worry about safety and correctness; even if it turns out to be much harder than we thought, that's for **after** there's consensus on the motivation.
Edit: on reflection, I do realize that some, perhaps many devs, have the opinion that they shouldn't get involved, and that it has to come from users. I disagree, but even if that position is correct, it basically means we've lost, because there is *zero* chance of progress without dev support. See: social signalling.

It's basically thoughtcrime, and it's disgraceful. One of the main reasons Bitcoin even interests me. I don't have some fundamental objection to the concept of "the State" (you can argue all day about that) but its overreach in this area is a huge deal, especially when you consider the hideous levels of corruption we see in e.g. the 2008 incident.
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:44:57
I definitely agree this is worth discussing, but it's a very controversial issue. Take for example the KYC case you mention: it's exactly the fact that such an ID gives a government total control over its citizens that motivates things like Bitcoin in the first place (remember the Wikileaks case).
But somehow there is a subtle middle ground here, the idea that one can use such data, but not for the intended purpose. Take e.g. Mike Hearn's suggestion to use zero knowledge proof of passport to serve the role - where a user can independently submit some part of the information but not all of it. It was very unpopular, but maybe not for good reasons. The real issues are around the subtleties of the exact properties. Or tlsnotary, where you can use the trust one has in a banking institution to correctly record balances, or even name and address, for a different purpose than intended. Mike calls it the "judo move", which maybe is not quite it, but a colourful analogy.
W.r.t. chipped ID cards with government digital sigs, I agree they open up a lot of new possibilities, but of course people correctly worry that they give huge power to the government to track your activities, which makes them profoundly unpopular in many societies. Even if you trusted governments with such power, the potential for incompetence to cause catastrophe is high. It feels to me that we kind of have to work around the edges.

That's not really how this works. Segwit was tested for a year on 3 or 4 different testnets. Also, if something goes wrong on Litecoin with segwit or Lightning it doesn't follow that there is a problem with it on Bitcoin. Litecoin is a relatively tiny community of devs compared to Bitcoin.
Not saying it's a bad thing, but the narrative that somehow upgrades have to be tested on Litecoin is wrong. Also wrong is to assume that the cartel controlled by Jihan Wu will let segwit activate on Bitcoin if it works out well on Litecoin; they won't. Best we can say is it may put more pressure on him/them.

People keep saying it but it's, at least partly, the wrong way to look at it. You can't start the analysis with what you *want* you have to start with what is safe. If I want to travel to another town 1000km away, I don't start with "I want to get there in 2 hrs, what do I have to do?", oh my car engine is not powerful enough, let me attach rocket boosters to it. No, start with what is feasible without killing yourself - what's the realistic top speed of the car, and work from there.
We don't calculate block sizes based on what people want - free transactions. We calculate it based on what allows the system to keep operating. Even at these 1MB sizes, the system would already have collapsed without intensive optimization work - but most public Bitcoin loudmouths never say thanks for that incredibly difficult work - they just complain.

Interesting point - he doesn't of course control any money, even if he has passwords, because they can block any transaction he tries to do. They can reset all passwords etc. There are two threats he could realistically make: (1) delete transaction records (very unlikely they wouldn't have backups) (2) *expose* information that someone might find embarrassing.
So (2) is more likely, and seems to be the threat, but then the question is, how can he objectively prove that the data he has is real? (maybe the answer is, he doesn't really have to completely prove it)

Yes, it's based on that, but be aware that it's a step up: with SSS you have to reconstruct the entire key in one location to sign (thus it doesn't provide the same security as bitcoin multisig/p2sh). Threshold signatures are taking the SSS concept, adding a bit of crypto magic and allowing the construction of a signature without re-combining the whole key in one place.

This is a reasonable way to think for certain kinds of traditional investments like buying stocks, where there might be some fixed minimum amount. With Bitcoin there isn't a minimum amount, the realistic limit is that the amount you buy should be at least a few times higher than the cost of the transactions you need to make to get in. In other words, if you're only comfortable buying $200 worth of Bitcoin, say, that's fine.

The principal of advantage of Bitcoin over SWIFT is *not* actually speed, although I'm sure it's very difficult to get fast and cheap wire transfers except in special cases today. 
The principal advantage is *neutrality*. In an untrusted network of banking institutions (imagine transfers between Russia-Iran-China-America-Saudi-Israel :) ), everyone is better off if the transfer backbone (the "rails" to use the trendy term) are beyond everyone else's control. The fact that it's cheaper and faster is a side effect of that.
It's true that local small networks of banks can get very fast inter-bank payments (see e.g. UK Faster Payments). I've always wondered if maybe Bitcoin's killer app is SWIFT replacement (imagine B2B large transfers across continents).

You don't have to "get yourself to believe" anything. Just send your transactions with high priority fee and see for yourself; transactions confirm in between 1 min and 30 minutes the vast majority of the time. I use bitcoin regularly and can see this for myself.
People telling you "the blockchain is slow" are either lying or ignorant. That's not how it works; how it works is, there is a market now for getting into the blockchain fast, and the price has gone up. If you don't have a high time preference, you can pay somewhat lower fees and let it confirm later.

Apparently not; when browsing around the site I find the number of offers for cash/in person trades is extremely low compared with those for say bank transfers, which is interesting.

Electrum 2 has multisig, although I'm not claiming it's easy (I've personally only taken a very brief look at it). Electrum is built into TAILS, but I don't think it's version 2 (the latest release) (?)
Fwiw, the only time I've used multisig "for real", I used pybitcointools to craft the txs. You can get the same functionality, of course, in Bitcoin Core on the command line. There's also sx (or whatever the latest flavour is called). None of this is noob friendly of course.
A lot of what's called "multisig wallets" is actually involving keys held by a centralised party. Obviously that way you get a lot more ease of use, but it's not usually what you need for sharing responsibility with peers.
If I wanted to setup actual arbitration with other peers, I would probably look to bitrated.com. That doesn't require programming skills.

Then don't use them, or complain about their shitty service. I did 15 transactions yesterday and all bar 2 were &lt; 15 minutes confirmation, because of sensible wallet fee handling. If people have built businesses based on super-low fees then their business model is broken, that's not Bitcoin's fault. If their business does not depend on super-low fees, then they need to fix their software and stop being amateurish.
Segwit will create more capacity, gradually, but it does *not* change the fundamental point: Bitcoin's blockchain cannot handle the world's transactions, so stop thinking of it as a place to put your coffee purchases for eternity, it's not going to happen.

That's kind of my point, though: the key phrase in what I bolded was "average punter" - people who are not technical experts don't have the wherewithal to protect large stashes; I would even say that it's far easier for them to protect cash notes or gold, although if they knew what they were doing, they could get a better defence with Bitcoin.
For a small group of people, "be your own bank" in the limited sense of protecting a store of savings, can work. But not for the majority, and moreover, even if you're an expert in crypto and software/hardware engineering, you still have the issue of rubber hose/$5 wrench attack. And it doesn't *only* take technical knowledge - it requires an attitude of taking responsibility. People find it really hard to accept the responsibility of keeping keys to their wealth safe.
I think it's all connected - the fact that Bitcoin is very "raw" or "hard" money. That's why it's so different from a bank account. Treating it as a replacement is the wrong mental model.

+1 Schnorr signatures. Here's a few reasons it's a no brainer:
1/ Schnorr has a security proof under the random oracle model (basically assuming hash function used is properly random), ECDSA doesn't.
2/ It's less complex, related to:
3/ The signing and verifying equation (basically s = k + xe in the scalar form) is linear, which means you can add and subtract them and retain validity.
4/ A lot of things come out of 3/. Most obvious is: N of N multisig can be achieved with only *one* signature on the blockchain. M of N can be extended from that. Large scalability wins can be achieved from this too, aside from multisig: e.g. doing a coinjoin where lots of people cooperate to co-spend their transaction but only need one sig on chain. Less obvious is the stuff that has been promoting recently: "scriptless scripts" where subtraction, rather than addition, of signatures can give rise to cool constructs (imagine the difference between a published signature on the blockchain and something else you have agreed off-chain can be used to do X).
The historical background which I guess some people don't know: Schnorr was patented up until around the time when Satoshi developed Bitcoin (or some years before, forgot), and this was I believe the main reason ECDSA, which is kind of a botched-up Schnorr, even exists. ECDSA doesn't have the crucial linearity property mentioned above.
Another somewhat similar thing, not in your list, is MAST, where we could have more complex scripting but with better privacy and scalability than having the entire scripts on chain.
I guess Schnorr is a simpler change though (adding an OP_CHECKSCHNORRSIG or something? never thought about the details).

Not disagreeing, but convenience is not the only thing that matters. For example, I think everyone should try to use E2E encryption for their email, and browse the internet over Tor, if they at all can. And heck, run a Bitcoin node too. All of these things might give very little personal benefit, but help society at large. Using these things when you don't need to, helps those who do need to (by increasing anonymity set, increasing network effect, and acting as a witness in some cases).
For most of us the right balance is 'do a little bit', I guess.

One could write a small book about what you're missing :) My point is not to criticize, only to say that it's a sophisticated and complicated topic. 
(1) don't reuse receiving addresses if you want privacy.
(2) Bitcoin has an intrinsic fungibility property in that **transactions are a many-many mapping**. That doesn't make it perfectly fungible, but it is a hugely important and overlooked point. Coinjoin is a way to make use of this. "Tumbler" services are a very nasty kludge because they require handing over your bitcoins to someone else, which in general is a terrible idea. Coinjoin does not require that.
Because coinjoin requires some kind of coordination between participants, there's a lot to think about before it can be useful. Search 'coinjoin' on bitcointalk.org to see gmaxwell's original detailed description, which is dense but worth reading if you want to understand this stuff. Please feel free to take a look at joinmarket if you want to see how some people are trying to make this work (I'm involved, and I can tell you it's getting a reasonable amount of use).
Bitcoin's fundamental model promises only pseudonymity, not anonymity, but a lot is going on in this area. Confidential Transactions is implemented in the Elements Alpha project (sidechains) and helps on the privacy side, but not so much on anonymity (cf. 'metadata' in the context of email). In many cases (most I guess), privacy is all you're really looking for; you just don't want people knowing your salary, say. 
But sometimes you want anonymity; when you want to buy certain medical services perhaps, you don't care about the information content (how much the treatment cost), you just don't want others knowing that it's **you** that made that payment. Merchants would help by not reusing addresses (see 1), but that may not be enough.
 Using Bitcoin itself, Tor perhaps (and similar network tech) and coinjoin can get us closer to the latter. And never forget that technology won't ever get you proper anonymity without a decent "anonymity set". If you're the only one in the world using Bitcoin it doesn't matter how well anonymity tech works.

@_date: 2015-03-09 20:42:57
Yeah, that was my guess.
The deeper point is that there are always hard/harder layers near the top, and these *have* to be less reversible. This is somewhat orthogonal to the *nature* of the lowest layer money, whether it be Bitcoin or fiat. There is no reason to assume Bitcoin can't have soft money layers for consumers.
These softer layers have to be more expensive, whether it's called transfer fees or fraud insurance.

I tend to agree that the demand down at the pennies level is very high; but there is such a thing as inertia, and that's why I don't think the transition is likely to be immediate; consider, if you can't afford to use BTC for your application today (e.g. some kind of badly implemented timestamping :) ), you may have come up with a workaround; an altcoin, a different system entirely. You're not suddenly going to switch back to BTC if the fees drop (or you might not switch back at all). Even more so for payments than for weird timestamping things.

Not sure why you'd say that. Darkwallet did have coinjoin, people did use it, and it also had stealth addresses, that were being used.
If you just mean the style of coinjoin wasn't good in various ways (e.g. 2 party), that's OK, such things are always arguable.
2 party joins are of course not private vs the counterparty but that's not the same as them having no value.

This is at least a plausible position to take, but I have serious doubts that it would be beneficial. And not *just* because it creates extra complexity (it certainly does that!).
I have also never seen PoS as at all desirable from a non-technical perspective. It's fundamentally a rent-seeking setup, rich get richer. PoW is not that, it requires performing better than your competitors, your profit is a function specifically of your superior performance. (note: ideally, there are not unfair barriers to entry like patents..)

Bitcoin is a *very* strange protocol - it requires *every* participant to hold *all* the information - the very opposite of efficiency, 100% redundancy. This is the way it solves the "double spend" problem - the problem that, if you tried to encode money as a bit of information, it could be copied infinitely. Because of this inefficiency, the rate of throughput is comically low compared to say, Visa. A possible (indeed, a quite realistic) solution to making this scale to much larger throughputs can be seen in the "Lightning Network", which allows transactions to occur "off-chain".

No, that's not the idea of a UASF. Suppose there are 1000 nodes doing meaningful economic activity and 10000 sybil nodes hosted on Amazon. It doesn't matter if the 10000 (overwhelming numerical majority) signal "X", if the nodes doing meaningful economic activity signal "Y" (in terms of protocol enforcement), they will just ignore what the Sybils are saying.

They have PGP keys for this reason. So the communication and rep is not limited to one marketplace.
If the marketplace owner holding the arbitration key disappears, each pair of counterparties has to come to an agreement. To the extent that rep matters (debatable), they may choose to complete the transaction honourably. If not, they are in a stand-off; in the presence of zero external incentive, one could theorize that the payout becomes 50-50 regardless of who owes who what. I doubt it would usually play out like that, but what's extremely unlikely is what happens in the Evolution case: both sides lose everything!
Edited to add: of course, it also removes the principal reason why the central counterparty would disappear in the first place! - rather crucial.

Mt Gox didn't "fool bitcoin". It/he fooled some people into handing over their money.
The blockchain just enables bitcoins to behave similarly to cash (irreversible payments). It seems self-evident that that does not prevent scams. That's not what it's for, any more than the purpose of dollar cash is to prevent scams.

That's not antifragile; an example of antifragile is how regular stress improves human muscle tone (it benefits from being "attacked" moderately, and dies in the absence of stressors).
Most of the concerns I've seen about sidechains being *dangerous* have been incoherent. If some people choose to send their bitcoins to a sidechain, and the sidechain blows up, they lose and every other bitcoin holder wins. That's the entire point of it; to wall off innovation/change so it can't hurt main chain consensus.
Much more coherent are concerns about how to secure a sidechain so that it works and has some decent decentralized security in practice (there are various options but none seem that convincing at first glance). Of course, they don't have to be decentralized either, and that's fine too, but nobody in that case is going to treat it in the same way.

That's not correct; miners *as miners* are *arguably* not part of the community (they could be excellent miners without having the slightest interest in Bitcoin as a currency). But miners also usually hold coins and perhaps use them for commerce; in that regard, they certainly are part of the community.
And even then as I say it's very arguable. A lot of people would disagree and say that even purely as miners they should have a say. I think they shouldn't because there's too much conflict of interest. Miners should remain anonymous or, at the very least, never attempt to get involved in discussions about the protocol.

Two comments: 
1. To use multisig, you only need signatures to combined in one place, not private keys. This is obviously a far better security model than a multi key physical lock where all the keys are in place at once.
2. Second, a multisig address can be 4 out of 7, in which case you would need *any* 4 out of the 7 keys to produce signatures to unlock. (Just worth mentioning because people wouldn't think of it from your analogy)

However, it removes the biggest *incentive* to shut down and run away (if we speak of 2 of 3 multisig).
On the other hand, there is a second big incentive to run away very suddenly: LE discovery. Even then, in many scenarios the market operator might be able to finish some trades/release funds. If not, the two counteparties in an open trade have to cooperate to sign a payout. It's an open question how well that would go, but my bet is that a large proportion of trades would be dealt with honourably, and some other fraction there would be a lot of "disagreement" and the payout might be something like 50-50 (eventually!). Pure guesswork, of course. A 0-0 payout would be bizarre and unfortunate but could happen, I suppose.

There's two facets: (1) Bitcoin is very hard to understand if you know nothing about the underlying technology ("bloody hard" is how Satoshi put it) because it's highly counterintuitive, and (2) you have to kind of grok the philosophical underpinning of open source and peer-peer network systems; this stuff has only recently (last decade or two) become a viable model of human interaction. A lot of people still don't get even that 2nd point, even long after Linux, Wikipedia, Bittorrent etc.

Bitcoins don't exist, only utxos exist. Every transaction does *exactly* what you say above, it destroys the old utxos (makes them unspendable) and creates new ones.
And because any transaction can have multiple inputs and outputs, this means that any tainting effort can only be probabilistic - such and such a utxo *may* represent the money from input 1, or it may be from input 2,3..9. It is only inference, there is no *actual* link telling you which it came from.

Learn how to hold the coins yourself. It isn't that hard, and it gives you what Bitcoin was designed for: actual ownership of your own money.
You don't *always* have to have *all* of it properly secured like that; you can put stuff on mobile, you can put stuff on centralized services temporarily, for convenience. But you really *have* to learn how to secure it yourself. E.g.: hardware wallets, 12/24 word seedphrases, running Bitcoin Core. There are different approaches, and none of them require a PhD in cryptography.
Otherwise you're just using a shitty Paypal, ultimately.

ECDSA has an inherent malleability (+/- s), RFC6979 can't fix that. Segwit's scope w.r.t. malleability fixing is broader than just the ECDSA signatures though, anyway.

Segwit *Is* 2MB. And yes it *is* hard to do SW + 2MB because it's a hardfork. To do just segwit is easy. It is being blocked by miners; we could have had it 5-6 months ago and we would not have the current problem. Nobody seems to want to accept it, but it is all about Bitmain.

No, it just needs a trusted *second* party.
Just think about physical cash. You hand it over at the checkout. You have an extra bit of safety in terms of physical proximity (cf various comedy skits where the person taking the cash says 'no, i never got anything from you, pay me please'). But apart from that, you're trusting that the other side will actually deliver. With digital cash payment, you have to remember it's cash - you hand it over, you don't have it. So you must assess differently to paying with a credit card, say. I would pay, say, Amazon with Bitcoin no problem, because I trust them to do business honestly. I've already paid quite a few merchants with Bitcoin based on this model. There is no recourse, true, but I get other advantages (not least, not handing over credentials).
Other cases:
A Nigerian wants to pay for goods digitally from overseas; Bitcoin will work better because of people not trusting *him*. The merchant needs zero trust in the buyer.
Use a third party anyway; use multsig escrow. It has the advantage of the escrow not having total control over funds during the transaction.

This is not realistically a problem, given the combinatorial explosion of repeated joins.


This is what you really mean, and it's true in the extreme: if only whitelisted addresses are allowed, there is obviously no way around that. Except for one thing: the entire point of Bitcoin was censorship resistant money. It wouldn't have been designed with the extreme decentralization that it is, except for that. If we are only prepared to use it in cases that the government specifically allows, why did we ever use it in the first place? Paypal's faster and simpler.

The "HK agreement" was an agreement between *some* developers and *some miners* which miners violated almost immediately, while those developers held up their end. It is of no interest to me either way. You can't enforce a hard fork like that.


Miners might want all sorts of things, why does that matter? Bitcoin does not exist to serve them. Moreover, their interests, if they act as a group, does not align with the interests of Bitcoin users, there is a very clear conflict of interest. They should be anonymous, and they should *never* have any say over the rules of the protocol (as *miners*; as users they're the same as other users) because of said conflict of interest. 


Segwit is a block size increase in both of the senses that matter: the number of bytes passed over the wire (segwit transaction serialization includes the witness inside the transaction), and the capacity (how many transactions can go into a block/ how many transactions per second are supported). The fact that it doesn't change a particular code variable is irrelevant, except for the fact that precisely because it doesn't change that variable, it's a soft fork, which is why it's a much better way of achieving 2MB.

It's difficult to answer in a very general way. But, consider that historically ownership was controlled by violence. More recently, we have had various social contracts - still backed by violence. The concept of 'rule of law' - with laws being set by some kind of modulated 'voice of the people', ideally. This new approach is more 'rule of algorithm'. To the extent that the Bitcoin blockchain cannot be shut down, it is a new way of defining ownership; my ownership of a particular chunk of bitcoin is not assessed by any government and cannot be (short of a complete shutdown of modern communications technology). Think controlled by the strong -&gt; controlled by the elected -&gt; controlled by no one.
It has become trendy to say "it's not Bitcoin but the blockchain" that's important. I *mostly* disagree, although it's a complex issue. The missing part of the discussion is the consensus mechanism. Bitcoin only gets the magical "consensus between untrusted participants" through its proof of work consensus mechanism, which itself works because of the incentive structure. Take out the incentive structure and you lose the consensus without trust property, which means that all you have is a big distributed database where you have to trust the participants in some way. A 'blockchain' in that case is just a fancy version of a linked list. A lot of the people who say "it's not Bitcoin but the blockchain" are looking at it in a very shallow way.
Yes, smart contracts are interesting but not in themselves world changing because they still need to be enforced. Take a look at Mike Hearn's old videos for some interesting ideas about how that enforcement could work (especially using Bitcoin itself or some other system of property rights).

There's a pattern here going back years; bitcoin/altcoins get "hot", particular exchanges get gravitated to because of ease of use, network effect kicks in due to large liquidity there, company is a bit amateurish/gets overwhelmed, system/website gets stressed, then things tend to blow up; either an insider runs off with the money, the state/legal system gets involved, external attackers see the huge honeypot. Whatever, the facts usually don't come out but somehow or other the whole thing implodes. Be *very* careful leaving significant funds on exchanges for any length of time.
Early warning signs usually involve delays in both deposits and withdrawals.

Trying to enforce any kind of tainting is still 'heresy', because it's an attack against Bitcoin as a form of money. Of course, nobody can stop anyone else doing it. But the good news is that there *are* several ways to defeat taint analysis, and while they're either cumbersome or impractical or unsafe today, it's going to get better.
Bottom line is Bitcoin *is* fungible at its core because bitcoins don't exist as entities. 
I think over time there will be a continuous back and forth on this. But don't expect anyone to offer anything but contempt to people who choose to actively attempt to destroy Bitcoin's fungibility, sorry.

I think the anger is towards someone publishing a "proof" deliberately designed to obfuscate, which contains no evidence. That's worthy of something, even if not anger...

You are almost certainly not comparing like with like (if you did, there's no way you would arrive at 1%). A lot of bitcoin activity (even on-chain, never mind the huge volume off chain) is speculative activity rather than e-commerce. If you include speculation on the fiat side, you have to include the trillions *per day* of just Forex (trying to make the best analogy since that's the currency part). Bitcoin speculation volume is really tiny compared with global speculative activity, even just in currencies, even just with the USD.

Finding modular inverse is not the problem here though (and by the way is not a hard enough problem for building an asymmetric crypto system, see Extended Euclidean Algorithm).
The problem here is called the "Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem" ECDLP.
The first step is to understand that K =k*G, K and G are not numbers, but points (x,y). So k*G means "do elliptic curve point addition (adding G to itself) k times". There is no K/G because you can add points, and you can multiply points by a scalar like k (meaning repeated addition), but you can't multiply two different points together - there is no such operation.

From anecdotal evidence (take it as you find it): first, there aren't realistic alternatives to Bitmain's Antminer at retail level (and even "retail" nowadays means in the many thousands of dollars). But more importantly, if Bitmain is your only supplier, and you're operating a biggish mining farm or pool, does it feel like sound business practice to go against your supplier's overt wishes? Not only did they actually backdoor the machines (entirely insecurely, btw!) with an offswitch, and not tell anyone (which btw would have lost them a *ton* of market share if they didn't have a monopoly), but I have heard (2nd, 3rd hand) that miners have gotten explicit pressure from Jihan to toe the party line on not supporting segwit.

I've never really agreed with this narrative. The system is open, there is basically no chance that powerful actors could coerce into non-fungibility with any secrecy, making it a pointless exercise.
There's a game theory element here of course; the *threat* of a change in PoW at some point has to exist in order for my argument to make sense. If it was for some reason never practical to change the PoW algo then simply seizing ASICs would indeed be game over for fungibility/non-censorship. But it *is* a practical possibility.
Meanwhile I am very dubious of the idea of "firing this weapon" without a good reason; bitcoin mining is highly specialised for logical market reasons. We can't mine gold with a shovel, that doesn't make gold useless, nor does the difficulty of becoming a Bitcoin miner reduce the value of Bitcoin.

"Blocks will always be full" over long time scales is not an unreasonable suggestion at all, I agree (although it's not guaranteed like a law of nature; blocks were not full for years).
But "blocks will be full again in seconds" is probably not the right way to say it :) If limit were increased to 2MB magically *right now* (means of course all mining software magically updated right now), then we'd have a few full blocks clearing the backlog, but I doubt the 500th block after that change would be full.

It's extremely frustrating that 90% of "expert" commentators out there don't even understand this much. They are not opposed to segwit, at least primarily, they simply want to "fire Core" because it didn't do what they wanted, and they don't *want* to understand that it is not a business, not a team, but an open source software project - *the* open source software project which is Bitcoin. (forget "Core").
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:05:13
I also like to bring up this counterargument, but it's became increasingly obvious that they actually are now willing to publically state that they consider cash in the same light: a tool for criminals that should be removed from public use. See e.g. Andy Haldane's recent comments.
To be honest this is a trend that goes back a long time, at least to the 70s - see the Bank Secrecy Act. J Orlin Grabbe wrote an interesting essay 'The End of Ordinary Money' that describes this context a bit.
So they are at least consistent (bitcoin just being non-state/fiat cash), no matter how ethically appalling you or I may find it.
The core of the argument seems to be that the public should not be allowed to have disintermediated ownership of anything.

Bitcoin is not traceable if not used naively, because there is no such object as a "bitcoin". Coinjoin as a concept was created to explain and illustrate this point. As soon as you have multiple inputs and multiple outputs in a transaction, the linkage is lost in an objective sense. All you have then is probabilistic analysis, which will totally fail in the limit of large numbers.
Somebody else has mentioned coinshuffle, which is an add-on layer (think of it as onion routing for Bitcoin) which makes life even harder because even the group of participants in a multi-party transaction themselves cannot know the linkages.

Proof of the non-existence of something is rather difficult to achieve. But if a person claims to be Satoshi, then provides "proof" which is just a heavily (and stupidly) obfuscated *copy* of a signature that everyone who runs a Bitcoin node has (a signature that was already on the blockchain), then it requires considerable imagination to conclude that the "prover" isn't just a conman.

Antminers may have been sold fraudulently, with an unstated backdoor that not only can switch off your miner, but reports your IP and MAC address to the company. In many jurisdictions that's illegal (without proper disclosure, afaik, ianal etc.). So it's not the customer engaging in fraud, a chargeback is the least one should be able to do.

Yes. Figures like 1-2% annualised (you're in that ballpark) seem to be quite normal. I did have 1 day recently where it was around 9-10% - but that didn't last :)
This is one reason we're not really interested in creating usability for the maker side - it's probably better if people are technically proficient, and there's no need to create any incentive for suppliers of liquidity. Even better, if coders are doing that side they might start coding their own yieldgenerator algorithms, and that diversity will be very helpful.
The risk/reward tradeoff is important (hot wallet as you say), plus you have to add to the reward side that you get meaningful privacy improvements through joins as a maker (even though the taker knows your linkages, but that's only for each join, not all of them). There are people doing joins for something close to free at the moment, and that was entirely expected.
The real market balance will only come in when the taker side has UI for non-techies. It would be great if some other developers wanted to start work on that. We have very limited resources development-wise. And there are other things which have to be v. high priority, especially security-related or anti-DOS or scalability.

No Core developer can "authorize" a hard fork, it would have to be overwhelming agreement by all parties. The problem with a hard fork is *everyone* has to upgrade.
The point about segwit, again, is that it already includes ~2MB block size limit; this is exactly what "Classic" (when that was the hot thing) was asking for. But apparently these people don't really care about scaling, they care about firing Core, everything else is details. Unfortunately "Core" is just a bad name for the software project which defines Bitcoin, so it can't be fired. All they can do is block progress and prevent improvements needed to make it more usable for more people, and that's what they're doing, which is disgraceful.

Possibly it was based on them somehow knowing it was via bitcoin.de, not sure; about the best you could say for other currencies in that regard is that maybe people aren't as aware of them.

I think quite a few systems like that exist around the world (various different versions). Paypal, Barclays Pingit, Webmoney, OKPay, m-pesa.
The fact that none of them use a pure public-private keypair is a result of the inability/unwillingness of ordinary people to manage keys. Same reason we have Coinbase (and people constantly complaining about Coinbase :) )
Edit: sorry, was forgetting the other crucial reason for not *pure* pub-priv keypairs. The centralized party must have the ability to censor transactions. That's a matter of the Orwellian laws we have. And of course that's the main reason both why Bitcoin exists and why it's experiencing so much turbulence.
TLDR digital fiat money is kind of old news.

Companies can accept bitcoin payments and get them automatically converted into dollars by Bitpay/Coinbase. I would have thought that's the idea, although those companies have also been known to refuse to accept business that's not legal, or in a gray area.

Then you support segwit as-is, because that is 2MB.
"Segwit-2MB" is badly named; if you bundle a 2MB hard fork base block size with the existing segwit upgrade then you've got "Segwit-4-8MB-HF" vs "Segwit-2-4MB-SF" which is what miners are refusing to activate.
Confusing things further, that is different from "activate segwit now and do a hard fork to 2MB base size after time X".


That's what Core's scaling roadmap said from a long time ago, that's why it starts with segwit (scaling improvements) including a rough doubling of blocksize.
@_date: 2017-05-14 07:51:20


Yes, without third party trust is how Lightning works; it's basically real bitcoin transactions, with broadcast to the blockchain put off till later, but using smart contracting to enforce if either side misbehaves.
As for trusted third party services as a way of moving payments off chain, that's already been happening for years, see e.g. Coinbase. It's entirely understandable that you don't want to use them, I don't either, but they exist for those who do, and they're cheaper and faster.


It's not about making money, it's about defence against attack. Use of the blockchain without paying for it, but forcing all other users to pay for it with cpu/bandwidth, is a classic tragedy of the commons problem. To the blockchain and all its verifiers (nodes), it doesn't matter if your transaction is for $10 or $10 million, because it has the same verification cost either way; the number of bytes is used as a crude measure of the cost. Monetary value unfortunately has no correlation (otherwise, if it did, I entirely agree it'd be much better to charge a fee as a percentage of the monetary value).

No, segwit is a blocksize increase. Have you coded segwit transactions? I have. The size of transactions, serialized into bytes and passed over the wire, in a block is allowed to be larger. There have been 3.7MB blocks actually mined and propagated on testnet with segwit. So, there are two ways to understand "capacity increase" here:
* Supports a larger number of transactions per block
* (Less good definition) larger blocks in bytes
Segwit is a blocksize increase by both definitions. The fact that it doesn't increase one particular code variable (but introduces a new one, weight) is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-05-14 07:01:56
I don't agree that $2 fees are absurd, but it doesn't really matter what I think, everyone has a different opinion about it.
Here's one thing I think everyone *should* be able to agree on (although some don't!): zero fees are absurd. Here's my specific reason for saying so: I run a Bitcoin node, partly for software development reasons, but also for maximal trust and privacy in my Bitcoin transactions. Yesterday I had to reindex (due to a crash on my machine), it took basically ~10 hours of somewhat cpu intensive work to rebuild the blockchain. Initial sync from scratch (downloading blocks) is of course even worse. Consider how much worse that problem would get if we allowed the millions of gambling transactions that would be on-chain if transaction fees were 10c or 1c. Demand for transactions at zero cost is effectively infinite; the more we allow, the more cost *every* bitcoin node has to bear, and gets zero reward for it. 10 x transaction throughput from here would make running a Bitcoin node near impossible except for industrial cost equipment.
So it's not about what we *want*, it's about what's practical. An everybody-process-everything system like the Blockchain *does not scale*, the only thing you can do is have a fair mechanism for inclusion, i.e. a fee, a price.
Meanwhile please don't forget that **we already have a solution** to this scaling problem. Off-chain transactions can be at many orders of magnitude higher throughputs (although only between a limited number of parties), while retaining trustlessness via fallback to the blockchain. It's not infinite scaling, nor is it immediate, but it is a valid path forwards.

Finalize early. I'm pretty sure I remember that right.
I agree it's a completely obscure terminology. Basically, funds are held in escrow by the marketplace owners (grr...) until the buyer confirms receipt of the goods. This can take a while of course. But, vendors pressured buyers to release/unlock the funds before they'd received the goods - called "FE". Seems this was/is a common practice.
If you didn't understand my (grr..) it's because the same functionality can be achieved with the marketplace owner only holding 1 of 3 multisig keys (they can arbitrate on who gets the money), without them having the power to simply run away with the money.

This is exactly the fantasy that a central counterparty will act with perfect morality and perfect omniscience that got us into the mess we are in today.

One obvious *potential* advantage is to allow large n,m. However there's a lot of unknowns here, as the signing process is interactive (so it could end up requiring a lot of time/CPU/RAM etc).  (Edit: for colour, read the end of the paper where they give timing data like 13 seconds for a simple 2FA 2 of 2 use case). There are also problems with the need for a trusted dealer, or alternatively some kind of MPC (I'm going by the academic paper linked there, although it also matches up with what I read in the past about threshold sigs).
The authors point out other potential advantages, especially related to anonymity (p2sh leaking certain info such as the M and N).

Presumptuous of me to say so, but this is emblematic of EGS's fundamental cognitive dissonance about Bitcoin: to him what matters is qualifications and status from academic/industry sources.
Note that of all the thousands of papers written about distributed systems and cryptographic money that were written in the 90s and 00s and that were *thoroughly peer reviewed* by *respected scientists*, none of them ever came close to solving the problem that Bitcoin solved (not that that's the only thing that matters, of course). Bitcoin was created by someone with *zero* academic credentials to refer to (whether he/she was an academic or not, doesn't matter, it wasn't used/relied on), was *not* peer reviewed in any journal, and it was implemented by a completely open, anarchic group of random developers (with much derision from observers), again without any specific status.
So EGS comes along in 2013 and basically announces that Bitcoin is busted, it's dead, hard fork immediately. And he was *incensed* that nobody really paid much attention; in fact, the flaw he found had already been observed in random forums and chatrooms that, to him, is just ridiculous, because discussions like that have no *status*. This is his specific (and vociferous) rebuttal to accusations of plagiarism - comments not made in peer reviewed papers are *worthless*.
So when a person like this goes to "Consensus" in which you have to have serious academic/industry credentials (or pay thousands of dollars to attend), it's "obvious" to him that the opinions of people there *really matter*. He's also completely wrong about that, just as he was from the start.
I think it's a common academic's mistake, actually, to focus too much on peer reviewed work. It's not like it's wrong to say that it's a valuable filter on genuine intellectual developments (random crapola whitepapers are going to be largely worthless), but fetishising it too much can miss the inconvenient truth that most academic papers end up being useless for anything except furthering their authors' careers (if that).
OK, "hit piece" over, I think the guy's pretty smart, to say the least :) But I also think he has developed a very skewed view of the Bitcoin world, and imo says a lot of unjustified things - and I think it's at least partly due to stuff like the above.

Mar/Apr 2013.


After taking a minute to parse this: no, that was not the "initial boom"; the first really obvious boom, from about $1 to $32 was in 2011 (in 2010 Bitcoin was barely functioning as a currency).
And no, the boom (let's say bull market) from late 2012 to Apr 2013 was nothing to do with Cyprus, that was just media bullshit.

Bitcoin only switched a fork in a situation where the reason was simply a technical failure. It was easy to get massive consensus there.
You could never get consensus for something like a theft rollback now. There have been several very big, public thefts and it hasn't even got to the point of being seriously considered. Bitcoin is just too big for that. I think it only happened once or twice in altcoins, and probably because they are such laughably small systems.

Well ideally, yes, but you still need to be careful - for example, don't reuse addresses. Even peer to peer doesn't mean that nobody ever knows anything about other people's business, so if you make a payment for a coffee, the cafe owner might be able to deduce something about your salary or your savings - just a crude example. Coinjoin is mainly about that kind of thing - regaining privacy or making it stronger. We still need it, or something along those lines anyway (there are other protocols).

It is literally a blocksize increase. The number of bytes in the block increases (it can go up to ~ 3.7MB, you can see such a block on testnet). Everyone will tell you it's "separated out" or some bullshit, that's not the case, the witness is serialized *inside* the transaction. I'm not saying this because it matters *that* much (it's *more* important what the *effective* blocksize is, i.e. how the transaction capacity changes), but because it's incredibly irritating after years of this to hear people arguing from a position of not knowing the basic facts.

That's like saying "the scripting engine doesn't know if a p2pkh (normal) transaction is wrong, because it's the *hash* of a public key". In other words, it doesn't actually make sense.


Yes, this is a foible, but so what, you have to get a lot of other things right, too. Meh.


This spectacularly misses the point. Multisig differs from Paypal or Evolution precisely in that a multisig escrow *cannot independently take the funds because they never have full control over it*.


True, but at least the most common failure scenario is handled: one side reneging on the deal. Where the central arbitrating party runs away, it's for sure awkward: buyer and seller, say, have to come to an agreement, but they will not just get nothing.

To me, this is the substantive part of your argument. You're at least *partly* right. Bitcoin mostly has utility at the periphery. Examples: gambling online, the person who can't get credit or a credit card, the person who refuses to use a certain currency or company for political reasons, paying where wire transfers are blocked. Small merchants who don't want to pay exorbitant CC fees for small purchases (hosting, VPN for example have already become big users). Using multisig to do things you can't do technologically otherwise. 
The thing is, every peripheral use case adds a bit of liquidity, and makes more normal uses more appealing (still less appealing than the old ways for the majority, but it's slowly changing). 
In the long run, it's the lack of a middleman that creates all these use cases.
As for packaging, we already have Coinbase and Circle, and today's wallets are much better than those of two years ago. It's changing, but slowly, and it's still very much peripheral today.

Joinmarket does not have "operators", it's not centralized in that way. Participants communicate with each other over 2 different public IRC servers (i.e. they weren't created for joinmarket); most connect over Tor, although not all, using pseudonyms that change on every re-connection. The messages passed between different parties on the IRC server are end-to-end encrypted (i.e. encrypted client side); but "announcement" messages from Makers are published in cleartext.
Those announcement messages can be read by anyone (and that's what you would have seen on any website, like joinmarket.me), just data that anyone can read by running a script.

There is a critical difference between Bitcoin's model and a distributed trust model (and I think this is often overlooked). Bitcoin relies on *verification*, not distributed trust. Yes, there are thousands of nodes, but we don't trust that the majority of them are honest, we trust that the majority of them are not colluding, and that's not the same thing, and even more *we will know if they are colluding*. The openness is critical. All their results are published into the open, and anyone externally can verify them.
To quote the whitepaper:


It doesn't say "distributed trust instead of centralised trust", it says "proof instead of trust". I don't trust anyone that 7+5 is 12.

As I've tried to point out a few times, like [here]( this is such a huge oversimplification that is effectively almost completely wrong.

@_date: 2017-05-17 07:04:47
I see two things wrong with your summary of the situation there.
First, there's a danger of focusing too much on the short term. Right now we have a very large backlog, but note that as recently as a couple of weeks ago I received a payment with a *1* satoshi per byte fee, after only ~ 24 hours. This was possible because for a long while the mempool was "flushing out" every sunday; in *that* scenario, there is enough capacity already for all-but-free transactions over a weekly cycle. Not saying that to suggest everything was hunky-dory but to point out that, if you think about it, that situation *strongly* implies that you don't really need to increase capacity by very much at all to bring fees way down (there's a tiny bit of slack in the system, so extra per-block space would increase that slack greatly, because it's an "at the margin" thing).
Now, if the situation of the last week or two persists, then it may be that quite a significant block size limit increase is needed to change the dynamic. But the 1-&gt;2MB change of segwit *is* *very* significant, albeit it would ease in gradually.
The second point is really more important: you argue basically &gt;&gt; 2MB is "needed", but asserting that something is desirable is not enough, you have to first figure out if you can do it safely. Only a couple of years ago we couldn't even do 1MB with reasonable performance, huge code improvements were needed. There is data out there suggesting that 4MB is dangerous from the point of view of propagation. For me it's a no brainer that an increase to 2MB gradually is a sane, sensible approach, and it being a soft fork is a huge help too. And it's been available for 6 months. It would really be helpful if people didn't aid the small group of miners who are maliciously blocking this hugely needed improvement (and gathering *huge* fees in the process), which opens the door to *real* scaling, by constantly arguing against it.
@_date: 2015-03-14 16:27:27

No, the nature of asymmetric encryption is such that you can create the public key from the private key, while not being able to do the reverse.
The address is a hash of the public key, and the encoding of the hash is of a special type in Bitcoin called base58check encoding.
The last two sentences are correct of course.

Git does this (yes I know you mentioned git earlier). Probably many other open and proprietary pieces of software which are less famous. Are we to call all of them 'blockchains' now? (even though they were created long before Bitcoin!)
 &gt;  Every full node in the system is synchronized with the rest of the network and will reach consistency with it
Any distributed database software provides this. It is, of course, much easier to achieve when decentralization is not a design requirement.


    Every block can be similarly authorized by a known entity / private key, meaning that any "51% attacks" can be traced and punished externally
Err.. this is called a 'digital signature' - it is not exactly a new technology and not limited to cryptocurrency :) To require that database updates be signed is not exactly a mindblowing innovation...


Actually there is never 'certainty' to get pedantic. Example, Ethereum recently had quite a big fork and Bitcoin recently had a smaller one - in both cases there is exponentially increasing probability over time. These are actually blockchains (although what Ethereum is to become after 'proof of stake' kicks in I don't really know). The certainty you'd be referring to in the case of a 'private' (read centralized) system is the kind of certainty we have today - "it's certain because he / they say so".
The bottom line is that Bitcoin's invention has to be seen as a whole, a synthesis, and we use the word 'blockchain' to refer to the database-like part of it. Torturing the word 'blockchain' to mean "a bunch of banks have suddenly discovered that cryptography is actually useful and are applying some of it like hash functions and digital signatures" is profoundly unhelpful.
This "torturing" is allowing people to claim that, once they throw away decentralization from Bitcoin, they have this shiny new toy called a 'blockchain' but what they are describing is nothing new at all.

Since I've never been involved I can't be sure, *but* I know they (sometimes? mostly? almost always?) use PGP keys and the quite possibly already use out of band communication with pgp encryption, at least if they're sensible they do because things like Tor hidden services are not reliable anyway.
I'm not saying your "cannot find each other" scenario is impossible, but surely it doesn't have to happen. Example meeting places might include: other darknet marketplaces, darknet discussion forums, anonymous email accounts, cryptocat type things(?). It's a bit out of my knowlege.

Generally, in cases of genuine criminality, it happens sometimes that the police take the Bitcoin in the sense that they force the suspect/criminal to hand over the private keys (e.g. wallet.dat password). Sometimes police do auctions to sell them off.
It's certainly possible for them to be hidden in such a way that no one can even know they're there (e.g. memorized 12 word seedphrase), but that kind of thing is more useful as a defence against casual snoopers (example: border guard). If someone has you in custody and has decided to take a forensic look at *you* they'll be analyzing every kind of metadata and they may well know how many btc you have for example. It's much less likely then that you'd be able to prevent them from finding your hidden stashes. But it's still possible.

I kind of wanted to counter Jeff Garzik's "it's not really a capacity increase because it won't get used straight away" on twitter, but twitter is rubbish for discussion.
* Non-used capacity is still capacity, so the additional capacity in segwit *is* available on day one, not later, when it gets used (it's an abuse of language to say otherwise)
* Of course it is important to understand that a capacity increase that requires new wallet functionality to use is not the same as one that doesn't; but consider (1) soft fork means no upgrade of any sort is needed to gain benefit from *others* using it early to increase the total capacity of blocks (2) unlike p2sh, there is an economic incentive to switch here, so while nobody knows, it's far from unreasonable to expect some subset to start using it quickly (3) a lot of wallets already have segwit working and have just been waiting.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:05:07

All these bandwagon hoppers (IBM with this, Blythe Masters the other day, etc etc) think they're really smart because they've noticed the deeper significance of "blockchain technology" being that it solves the problems associated with clearing and settlement. But I continue to be mystified that they still don't see that it *only* solves that because it's completely self-contained and doesn't use a TTP. To peg a token (and I mean really peg, not mind-games / game theoretic approach which is not a guarantee) you will need a TTP somewhere, thus reintroducing the original problem with an additional hugely expensive blockchain layer.

Seconded, further, if I was a criminal I would *not* rely on Joinmarket alone, there is a fair amount of metadata. This is not a defence against the NSA.
A single join would do very little (as above, it's mainly for deniability and general fungibility improvement), while running in a sequence (see the "tumbler" algo) does a lot more, but is far from guaranteed to delink perfectly (see [this]( I wrote ages ago with some thoughts on this). Another factor is the role asymmetry (maker/taker) which you have to think about; as well as aforementioned 'tumbler' algo, see 'patientsendpayment'.

I agree with this answer, but also to mention: it happens fairly often, so the question is not purely theoretical. Another thing to mention is that the cost of including transactions in a mined block is pretty low. It's not zero; there's a network latency cost in mining a block of 1 MB vs 100kB.

Such a thing should never be considered, under any circumstances whatsoever. It destroys the entire point of Bitcoin.

I would say it's substantially *worse* than considering a change to the inflation schedule, although that is not negotiable either.
But, no point getting upset about it, anyone who tries to do that will just go off into altcoin land, Bitcoin as a bearer asset will survive.

It's peer to peer. There may actually be a 4th or even an 8th party involved, but none of them have to trust each other, so the normal meaning implied by "3rd party" doesn't apply here.
As for whether coinjoin makes a profit, that question seems malformed. If two parties enter into a coinjoin transaction there is no need for either party to pay the other a fee. Joinmarket is the specific idea of trying to introduce fees to aid liquidity of coinjoin, but fees are not of course necessary.

Simple: no one is in control, no one acts as a middle man. Political neutrality. There is a story in the news today, coincidentally, of Russia setting up a SWIFT-like rival entity to counteract the blocks put on them in that payment system.
The fact of no one in control also keeps costs down. See the introduction to the whitepaper for an elucidation of this point.
I've said for a long time on this sub that Bitcoin is SWIFT not Starbucks points, so I agree with a lot of other commenters here.

Levels of understanding:
* Bitcoin is anonymous
* Bitcoin is not anonymous, it's pseudonymous.
Absolutely, but does that distinction matter so much? If all of an address' transaction records are public it only takes *one piece* of correlation that ties the pseudonym to an owner, and suddenly everybody knows everything about you (modulo the sanity of your wallet's address/key management of course).
So this is a slightly confusing situation; it almost seems like both sides of the argument can use "bitcoin is pseudonymous" to argue their point.
* Bitcoin can be perfectly transparent, or, with effort, as close to really anonymous as you're prepared to make it - although the latter *might* depend on the behaviour of others.
There are various approaches to coin fungibility and mixing/joining, from the highly-dubious-in-principle (using centralised mixers, using altcoin exchange) to the more sound but not-much-in-use-yet coinjoin and variants, coinswap (is that used at all?), maybe stealth addresses too. 
But as a matter of principle, Bitcoin was designed with fungibility at the transaction level: outputs are not marked as to which input they came from. So with enough ingenuity and intent, the origin of coins *can* be obfuscated. However the caveat is that any system designed to achieve this really needs a large enough 'anonymity set' to be useful. The devil, as so often, is in the details.
I think it's worth observing that the third of the above descriptions never seems to be given by "serious people" talking to "people in suits", which I think is unfortunate.

This is completely wrong. Cash *is* settlement - that's what it means, having no counterparty risk. To have a *consumer payments* system on a global blockchain is unworkable and not even desirable. To do that, you use the base, uncensorable, irreversible, and heavy layer of real hard money (cash-like money) and you build more lightweight (faster, cheaper, with *potential* but not *requirement* for trusted intermediaries) on top of it.
Building a completely centralized and therefore censorable (because only like 10 datacenters can operate it) base layer means you never understood why the blockchain part was there in the first place. That's just a shitty Paypal.

I did my best, told people on IRC, twitter, reddit r/joinmarket. Seems nobody noticed.
Part of the problem is I needed people to test it before saying to everyone "this is available", but couldn't get anyone to do so.
There's actually a reason for this - the people who are really interested in Joinmarket are (a) more serious users that do everything command line anyway and (b) tend almost always to be Makers (yield generator users). So when I ask for testers for GUIs or simple user tools they aren't so interested.

To make the statement you first have to define what you consider a risk, really. In general I don't agree, although I can see arguments for doing hard forks. One of the problems is a critique of soft forks which doesn't distinguish what kind of thing a soft fork is doing tends to miss the point. Soft forks can be quite evil, if you take the concept in complete generality.

Bitcoin is intended to be digital cash. It's pretty fundamental about cash that it doesn't have a memory. When you pay for something in a store, the clerk does not ask where the $10 bill came from. This fungibility is fundamental. Even putting aside political questions, imagine the extra costs involved if each dollar bill's history had to be checked every time it was used. Consider the horrible extent to which underprivileged people are blocked from engaging in commerce just because of where they live, because we don't have this kind of memoryless money online. Consider the invasiveness of privacy and vulnerability to hacking that comes from credentialed financial accounts being stored in corporate databases. Etc.
Participating in coinjoin transactions is a way to make it more true that bitcoin is like cash. That's the main reason I do it. I'd argue that just the fact that coinjoin is **possible** is a hugely important fact - it means that tracing coin history in the blockchain is probabilistic rather than deterministic, and in some cases it's basically impossible.
If you want Bitcoin to be a real digital money, support coinjoin in whatever form. If you believe that money should be entirely under the control of the state, that all your purchases should be censorable and controllable by corporations and governments and you should not have personal freedom and rights, then by all means support "AML" and campaign to end physical cash :)
On your last point: Makers can connect over Tor, although I think the main reason to do so is to bolster security.
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:20:00
Incorrect, they have been *preventing* bigger blocks by not activating segwit, which is bigger blocks.
Creating bigger blocks through a hard fork is not something the dev team can deliver with a few lines of code (or indeed hundreds of lines and thousands of man hours of testing, as they did with segwit). It's not really in the devs' hands; it can be done any time, if the will is there. To do it *properly* does indeed require devs' help, as well as a lot of preparation. I don't see any meaningful group of the active devs saying they don't want to do it, it's even in the roadmap and there have been active efforts in that direction.
What's so appalling is the constant portrayal of "Core is blocking 2MB" which is wrong first because segwit is 2MB, and second is wrong because of the above, and then stuff like what Silbert publishes says "segwit and then 2MB" when segwit is completely screwed up by the proposal (signalling bit) instead of actually activated, which it could have been 6 months ago and the argument would have been further along (without $2-$3 fees, and with early Lightning). I know you're convinced you're the one being reasonable, but you're not. Stop thinking that the business people are the adults in the room here, you're clueless and what you're doing is blocking and delaying real progress at every step.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:09:15
One example is transactions between Coinbase customers. Not a customer  myself, but I believe for many years they've offered the ability to make payments between clients either immediately or for free or both; I'm sure someone who uses it could tell you.
As well as those centralized off chain solutions, there are simple unidirectional payment channels that take trust out of the equation, but being only one way are obviously a bit limited in use cases. With the malleability fix (requires segwit) we can get a decent implementation of Lightning that would extend that into a p2p network and also be bi-directional.

No coins are lost in the fork. Your BTC is still there. There's no change in the number of BTC in circulation (= the total value of all the existing unspent outputs).
In the newly forked BCH chain, you have a BCH version of all the coins you had on Aug 1 on the BTC chain.
Note you also have 'CLAMS' if you had BTC on some particular date in the past. Also I think some 'byteball' or something. None of this affects BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:36:14
Make sure you're using the latest version. A few versions back there were some problems with fees iirc. Pay attention to what you're setting with the dynamic fees, and also take note of the fee that's proposed before deciding to go ahead. Also, the latest versions have RBF.
Personally, I've always found Electrum to do a perfectly good job with estimating fees when I've used it.

To my mind, the best kind of paper wallet is a 12 word seed because (a) you can remember it, easily, (b) it serves as a permanent backup for a whole wallet which is constantly in use, including if file gets lost or destroyed, and (c) if you want to hide the paper version  you can easily use steganography or encryption, whatever you like.
I consider wallet.dat files a liability (even if encrypted) and remove them whenever I can.
The traditional concept of a paper wallet is not a bad solution at all, it has its pluses, but it doesn't come close to being able to store a whole wallet in 12 words in my opinion. Of course, that technology is not limited to Electrum.
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:21:20
Yes, I agree, it's nuanced and not either-or. It just makes sense that "raw" Bitcoin is more a base layer with *relatively* infrequent transactions, and everyday transactions occurring on either a sidechain or completely off-chain with some kind of trust relationship. There's a lot that can be done to leverage Bitcoin's special properties without every transaction being on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:02:00
Nobody knows because it hasn't happened yet :)
Our best speculation is that the earnings will not be high, because it will be easy to take part. Possible factors might include the size and perhaps the age of the utxos you offer for mixing. It's pure guesswork :)
How about this for a mindbending feedback loop: as coinjoin participation increases, the interest rate on joins decreases, but the value of *any* Bitcoin increases due to increased fungibility.
Heh, like I said, pure speculation.

No, it's nothing to do with ASN.1 (thank God!)
Addresses are base58check encodings of scriptPubkeys, with a version number byte prepended as the first byte before encoding; for p2pkh that byte is 0, leading to a '1' as the b58 encoding (the b58 output has n '1' characters at the start where n is the number of leading zero bytes before encoding). For p2sh that magic byte is 5 which b58 encodes as '3'.

Monero, as-is, with ring-CT, requires far larger transactions (mostly due to range proofs). There is also a fundamental problem with inability to prune the utxo set.
I'm all for continued research, hopefully they can improve the scalability substantially, but let's not forget there were at least two catastrophic crypto breaks in the last 6-9 months, luckily both were caught in time (one before being put into prod, obviously that's better..). It's cutting edge stuff and it's great research, let's not pretend all the problems are solved and there's no issues/dangers.

I don't agree with the idea of using Nubits.
Here's the error in thinking to me:
* We can't use bitcoin to price contracts because its value is too volatile
It doesn't follow. It would be easy to chain together a bet on, say, a presidential election, with a concurrent bet on the btc-usd price to keep the value from the user perspective stable.
Doing that instead via an altcoin is asking for trouble, not just because an altcoin is untested in various ways and lacks security, but also because the approach to establishing stable value is not going to be as good as the massively liquid btc-usd prediction market you'd eventually have at the center of all your prediction markets. In comparison to that simple, elegant market-based mechanism, the complex political structure that nubits uses looks like a disaster waiting to happen.
At the end of the day you don't get what you absolutely need - censorship resistance - without *full* decentralization and the processing power to back it up. For me, it has to be Bitcoin or nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:46:25
The "agreement" seems to be such a morass of political horse trading that none of the participants even know what it is. I don't pretend to know what caused Eric's specific reaction here, but it's part of the overall pattern: we've had a scaling solution ready for 6 months but we just get this constant stalling and confusion pattern, at some point you have to realize that it's *effectively* maliciousness, even if that's not its primary intent. A lot of us think UASF is the only right, principled stance to take specifically because Bitcoin is under attack (it's not like a cartoon villain, it's a particular way that incentives have misaligned themselves).
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:52:16
offered the theory that the events on litecoin were more significant than our UASF movement - note how the litecoin market (small as it is) reacted to positive and negative segwit momentum, and then activation. This may have changed some miners' minds.
(It's hard to say, but also, you have to consider there was a lot of discussion of UASF for those guys too; it was similarly 'averted' with a backroom agreement)
FWIW I am also not celebrating, even if segwit activation goes smoothly, because it is *very* unclear exactly how things play out in the next 3 months. Note that that's nowhere near enough time for the full benefits of segwit to play out; I guess we will get enough usage to make a difference after about 2 months, but things like Lightning need a lot more time than that to really kick in.


Umm, they are also getting larger blocks. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:49:08
At least theoretically, I'd argue it's a pretty big step up: with localbitcoins, you have to hold a wallet with them, albeit only temporarily. That's a target. It also creates a database of info that could be demanded by certain agencies (although that's a foggier point).
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:08:34


Not true. Its use as a currency is being blocked by miners, not developers. Segwit is a block size increase and additional, very important scalability tech, and makes way for huge scale with Lightning.


As above, completely false.

I disagree. Bitcoin does not replace the entire functionality of banks. Even claiming it replaces a bank as a place to deposit money is arguable, but it of course doesn't attempt to replace any other functions (for example lending). The weird thing about Bitcoin is it's, in a way, attempting to replace the *two extreme ends* of the financial system, but not the middle: central banks at the top (money supply) and physical cash/physical stores of wealth at the bottom. The connection between the two is that Bitcoin is trying to take the role of "hard money".
Of course a lot of people in finance thing that blockchain technology can replace backend functions like settlement; leaving aside the big debate over how or whether such systems are going to work, it's a similar concept: "hard" money or assets being transferred, that's kind of the point of settlement, its finality.

No (to the implication), segwit is not "anyonecanspend" else the $1M on litecoin would have been taken. It can be *made* anyonecanspend on an alternate reality chain, but so what, literally *any* coins can be made anyonecanspend if you change the rules of the system ...

Jon Matonis is indeed wrong; *why* he's wrong and supporting this proven fraudster I don't know, and don't particularly care. I wrote this [tweet]( in response to him publishing Wright's fake "proof" page in which he pretends that the transaction signature from block 9 is actually a signature on his own message. Matonis' original tweet is probably redacted, I'm not sure, not a Twitter expert and don't really care. But he's constantly posting utter rubbish like "Schnorr is unproven tech" (when it's actually got a provable reduction to ECDL, i.e. a security proof, which ECDSA doesn't), and retweets or supports any horseshit attack on segwit. He either has *really* poor understanding of Bitcoin technically (probably) or is just big time involved in Wright's scam and is saying anything he can to bolster it. Who cares at this point, he's made himself irrelevant.
Stop using social proofs, they are not reliable, and you don't need them if you have facts - it's a *fact* that Wright published a signature proof on his website, that was a trivial, amateurish fraud. It was discovered in less than an hour if I recall correctly.

They have a well defined plan to shift to PoS. I'm not sure when the decision was made (about a year ago?), but the system is set up like that right now; there is some kind of 'difficulty bomb' that means that miners will not be able to mine blocks after a certain point in time. I don't know the details. But, I do know that they are still actively discussing the details of how the PoS system will work now, even though the system is already live ... which seems a bit crazy to me. Also, I think PoS is fundamentally unsound (or, more nuanced opinion: it offers a very different set of tradeoffs and is not really decentralized in the same sense as PoW).
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:34:08
That's what I was trying to explain. It was a very high level explanation, mainly because I haven't gone through the details myself yet. You can find some old threads here where Rusty Russell and others have described in more detail (as well as find the technical papers on github). Another way to put it (does it help?) is that the threat of fallback onto the blockchain ratchets the trust in the blockchain. In Lightning they are transacting with real bitcoin transactions; they're just not publishing to the network except when there is a protocol violation or when they want to do finalisation of an account (closing a channel). Look up "micropayments channel" on the bitcoin wiki for the basic idea, it's an extension of that.

You wouldn't *need* to - but I'm saying that, you make a withdrawal from Coinbase to address A - so Coinbase knows that you own that address. If you then send directly to Mega address M, then Coinbase knows for sure you that you bought something from Mega. If instead you generate new address B, and pay A -&gt; B then B -&gt; M, Coinbase doesn't know for sure that you own B, so they can't infer that you paid Mega. At least, not with any certainty.
Wrt any wallet - I guess most wallets allow you to create new addresses. But I think some mobile wallets don't; not sure.

(1) the latest update (literally today) makes it faster with headers-first , (2) you don't have to use Bitcoin Core (the new name for Bitcoin-Qt) and it probably isn't well suited to a casual user, for the reason you described (3) you can use Electrum and have a perfectly functional wallet without this hassle (4) you can use bittorrent to download a big chunk of the blockchain to speed up the process (5) as laid out in section 7 of the whitepaper, and according to changes ongoing in core dev right now, it will soon be possible to run Bitcoin Core without a full copy of the blockchain.

Sorry, I was wrong, Electrum does use SPV; it's a confusing topic because Electrum connects to an Electrum server - but it also uses the SPV mechanism which a thin client wallet like Multibit uses. Note that Multibit doesn't access any 'servers', just directly connects to the Bitcoin network.

Bandwidth will eventually become a problem if everything stays on the main chain. That's the main bottleneck.

Although clearly things went wrong, I think that the problem was much more at the lower level of the 'stack' - the p2p networking stuff - seems that way, at least. It remains to be seen whether the higher level functionality (e.g. the way they've set up notaries and arbiters) is going to work out well. But generally speaking, since this is basically all volunteer worrk, we're not in a position to complain that it isn't working yet :)

Good call on the use case, edited, thanks.
Whether bank transfers are reversible is an extremely grey area. For example, the UK "Faster Payments" is specifically advertised as being irreversible after a few minutes. International SWIFT transfers have always been considered more-or-less irreversible after a confirmation period. But when you delve into it, you do find cases of reversing. The issue is how hard is it to reverse over what time frame.
In an absolute, theoretical sense there is no final 100% fiat irreversibility, as a consumer, (edit: except cash! doh) and so it could be said that this approach to bitcoin-fiat trading never 'works'. But it's a matter of practice, not just theory. You can reverse a credit card payment in a few minutes over the phone. Reversing a transfer to a foreign country via SWIFT 15 days after it happened is going to be close to impossible.
And finally, the fact of doing peer to peer trading makes it less likely that banks themselves will be reversing transfers, so that's a nice extra (if it's used that way).
There are tons of reasons why this isn't perfect, but it also is a huge step up from 'send us a scan of your bank statement/receipt/letter etc'.

The problem with trading via things like bank transfer is bank accounts get phished, then a seller gets his account flagged.

That doesn't seem like a good general statement; there are probably only a few countries in the world with significantly more liquid BTC markets than the UK.

I'd recommend anyone to take a look at the 31c3 video presentation about the recent Estonian election system implemented using chip based ID cards. Covers a lot of the issues and is very entertaining.
Using crypto to support internet voting is a really fascinating and challenging topic. There *may* be a use for blockchains here but I'm not convinced, personally. Certainly it doesn't address the main issues, some of which you've listed.


Nope. The trick is to allow a person to change their vote. See the Estonian example I mentioned (also I think another country has done something like this, forgotten now which one).

Comply with what? Not just being facetious, but if you're operating a business entirely online using Bitcoin, I'm not at all sure how any particular country can justify jurisdiction over you.
Server admin lives in Morocco. Server is hosted in Ireland today. Next week it shifts to Russia. Employee in France. Customers in 100 different countries. No packages are ever sent from anyone to anyone else. Who claims jurisdiction?
I know a common response is "if you have a US customer then you have to follow our rules, else we shut it down", but let's be honest that hasn't been working and it's not going to work, when it comes to even quasi-decentralised businesses operating purely online, like a gambling site. It's a joke, they can't stop it and they should focus their law enforcement effort on something more productive.
Another point is that if the US has a specific law, they can block US IP addresses and then they don't need a "license". Meanwhile the US customers can just use VPNs.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:38:44
You're quite wrong; it *does* raise the blocksize. Have you coded segwit transactions, or read the BIPs at all? There are two senses in which "block size increase" can be meaningful - how many bytes are passed over the wire in the blocks? It's bigger in segwit - up to nearly 4 times bigger in the theoretical limit, about 2x bigger in the realistic practical limit, for now (based on current transaction patterns).
The second sense, more practical but less exact, is "increases the actual number of transactions that can be in a block" (and therefore the tx capacity of the network).
It also increases this, substantially. So yes, it is categorically a block size increase.

The law classifies exchanging Bitcoin for cash as being a money transmitter? I'm not surprised if so, I'm just of the opinion that it makes no sense. A money *exchanger* perhaps, but not a money transmitter (which surely means an intermediary).
Even if they classified it as being a 'money exchanger' as some kind of special entity, I'd still object. Then any person choosing to change money in an airport is a 'money exchanger'.
I think it makes more sense to call it 'barter' because although it makes more sense to consider Bitcoin as a currency than a good, the key point is that this is a peer to peer voluntary exchange, not centralized service.
At the end of the day all the laws about "money laundering" are completely unethical from my perspective, but even if they're not unethical they make no sense; regulators and enforcers just choose to interpret words however they feel like.

It's interesting, but this is one of the most common sources of confusion about Bitcoin, but the question isn't really about Bitcoin specifically, but about open source software in general. For example: if you use Firefox browser, you're using open source software for all your online commerce, which is pretty much just as security sensitive as Bitcoin. The idea is that because everyone can look at the code all the time, and anyone can copy it at any time, it greatly weakens the negative aspects of hierarchies. Corruption likes secrecy. So it might be true that only 5 or 10 people have the influence to push through a change to Bitcoin source code or Firefox source code, but it's actually much better than that: if the core developers decided unilaterally to make a change that the general community didn't like, everyone would see it happening in real time (and there are thousands of educated eyes looking at this stuff 24/7), and in extremis, another group could create a copy of the code (a 'fork') and say to everyone "look, you don't need to use this malware or corrupted code, you can use this clean version instead". This openness is a very profound feature of the way technology works today, but the general public hasn't quite caught on.

Yes, but Bitcoin has independent utility in its notarizing value (timestamping). It is better than anything else for this purpose, because of the hashpower defending the ledger against corruption. People always seem to miss this. However, there is a feedback loop element, because the notarizing value depends on the hashpower, which realistically depends on the currency usage.

If we talk of something like shapeshift.io, or something like Cryptsy, then it's because you're going through a centralised party.
There are other exchanges of altcoins that are notionally decentralised, but you'd have to be careful to read the fineprint to see to what extent it really is trustless. And even if you're dealing with a genuinely trustless cross-chain transaction, that still might not give the anonymity function.

The blockchain isn't for sending files (actually it isn't for *sending* anything, including Bitcoin - it's for recording ownership changes, or proving data existence). It is technically possible to embed files (smallish ones, not videos) in the blockchain, but that's expensive and wasteful.
What *is* more practical, and you may have heard about this and misunderstood it, is to timestamp data in the blockchain. You take a large file, and make a sha256 hash of it; that's only 32 bytes but is effectively a unique 'stamp' of that file - no other file would generate the same hash. You can then embed that 32 bytes of data in the blockchain and by doing so, prove that you had access to the file at that point in time. This kind of thing could be useful for property rights, among other things.
Bitcoins are not sent over the blockchain; Bitcoin transactions are embedded in it, which transfer property rights over specific chunks of bitcoin from the owner of one private key to another. Basically.

Cash (whether physical or digital) is a settlement system which is also a payments system. Cash by definition represents full and final settlement.
When people refer to "payments systems" they almost invariably do *not* mean cash; they mean things like the VISA network which provide a layer on top of cash that provides additional features. From this perspective, Bitcoin is digital cash, and not a payments system. And this is the perspective that matters when you are considering whether Bitcoin is suitable for paying for coffee at Starbucks. So you either use something else entirely or you build layers on top of Bitcoin.

The payment *is* unverified (unconfirmed) until at least 1 block has been mined, which takes on average 10 minutes. However, it's quite common for the payment to be accepted before that (it's a long, complicated argument as to when that is/is not a good idea).

I have to admit I totally lost it when, **yet again**, a commentator that's supposed to be supporting segwit fails to give a clear answer to the key question every casual observer wants to know.
After 20 minutes explaining the disaster scenarios that could occur, when asked "will this actually solve the problem of high fees/slow transaction (the interviewer erroneously states more than once that **both** are the problem, actually it's one or the other)?", Trace Mayer goes back to a long diatribe about supporting both chains instead of clearly stating what should have been hugely emphasised from the start: **that segwit increases the blocksize** (of course you go on and explain the context in detail, but this is critical to the *casual* listener/watcher, because it shows how outrageous blocking segwit actually is).

I think it really started to come to a head with Hearn prompting Gavin to become more forthright and developing XT in tandem, this was ~ end 2014. Hearn and Gavin can be found on a youtube video, and Mike is prompting Gavin to become more of a "benevolent dictator", this was maybe Dec 2014. Then eventually there were Gavin's blog posts and Mike issuing XT specifically as a competing client in early 2015.

Apart from be careful to test new things with small amounts at first: 
The main thing is to learn how to back up from a seed, so that you can access the wallet on any computer. Once you have this, you can feel a lot more comfortable that you're not going to lose your coins just because of some mistake.
Then think carefully about the best way to create a secure setup (e.g. a separate laptop or usb linux install), best way to store the seed (in your brain, on paper in plaintext, encrypted, etc.), and look at some of the extra features available on the command line, and look at how to do offline transaction signing.

Probably the easiest to understand (if very complex under the hood) example of why malleability matters to privacy is - Lightning is half-broken by malleability, requiring ugly workarounds. If we get to a point where Lightning is the majority of payments, that will be much more private.
A more concrete way of looking at it that might be easier to understand - with a malleability fix, you can prepare refunds in advance before making a payment to a contract. This means that both pay-in and pay-out from an atomic swap can be 'normal' looking payments (p2sh) instead of complex on-chain custom contracts, which means atomic swaps can be much closer to private, making blockchain analysis much harder (crudely, I could swap the history of my coins with the history of your coins).

Yes. The core concept is to use a virtual machine to replicate the exact build environment. Then the binaries produced by different people will be byte-for-byte compatible. The Tor project uses this (although I think it was first set up by bitcoin people like Luke-Jr and others?).

I think Richard Stallman, although he maybe hasn't fully grokked Bitcoin, had it right when he said: what Bitcoin needs is anonymity for the consumer/user. It's fine that we don't have anonymity for businesses. So absolutely, I agree, I feel no need to "demonstrate my validity" when I'm making a payment. The companies which ask for payment from me for a service, *they* need to "demonstrate their validity" by having a reputation or some other assurance. That's how business works.
@_date: 2015-10-18 13:07:33
The issue you raise is a real one, but you're overstating your case. What makes Bitcoin or PGP different from gmail or Facebook or a banking app is, its *core concept* is individual ownership. If our only goal was usability, we would certainly remove the requirement of storing secrets by users, because obviously they're (we're) bad at it. But that is not possible for Bitcoin without passing control of your money to third parties (although for sure it can be done partially, using multisig, and those solutions are really interesting, with various tradeoffs).
All the examples of "excellent UX for security" are based on removing all responsibility from the user to do anything at all. TLS on the internet is a good example.
But I emphasize, you *do* have a point. I'm just saying that there is an underlying problem that can't be dismissed.

A multisig is a strict improvement on an escrow relationship because it does not require the third party (arbitrator) to hold the funds, so it loses that element of counterparty risk.
A coinjoin, strictly speaking, is a smart contract between the participant but needs no third party at all; it's basically "my payment goes through if and only if my counterparties payments go through". There is no counterparty risk here either, only risk of failure to complete (DOS risk).
More advanced/powerful smart contracts without counterparty risk:
Atomic swap of coins (on one chain or between chains): here the counterparty is effectively the Bitcoin blockchain; assuming it delivers on its promises (transactions are public and irreversible), the execution of one half of the contract (payment A-&gt;B) enforces execution of the other half, because a secret is revealed on blockchain in that payment, so B-&gt;A will happen.
Lightning leverages the above to develop networks of contracts that can settle off-blockchain but use the blockchain for the security fallback.
A more technically advanced example of a no-risk on-blockchain smart-contract: see [ZKCP](
Smart contracts based on off-blockchain information like weather in san francisco or whatever: it isn't possible to do these with cryptographic security, so there is a trusted third party; there are lots of ideas to make this rely less on trusting the counterparty (sometimes called "oracle"), often using distribution of trust, and often using game theoretic constructs, but they're a different animal.

When it comes to *integrity* of memory, I don't think that's a critical point with these mnemonic schemes (and not only because of checksum words), and when it comes to just "overestimating" memory generally, I find in discussing this mnemonic system people vastly *underestimate* their memorization ability.

Yes it seems that way. The main point being (since the comment thread on the blog is now getting long, better precis for the reader!) that with an all-of-all (N-N) control over one transaction, it ensures that everyone gets the necessary secret to spend their funds as long as *one* participant spends, meaning there's only really a need for 2 locktimes, not N, as I originally thought.

On multisig, you have a good point in general. What arrangement of keys do they have? To protect users from their own mistakes, you'd generally have the company owning some part of the set of keys, so my statement "owning the keys" is not totally removed, except in this case it might be more a positive than a negative. A wallet like that can be a great service, but we'll see how it develops.

I don't think you're right here, and I don't get what you mean about the indexing. Let me explain it as I see it. First, postulate a bulletin board so everyone can broadcast anonymously (this is part of Coinshuffle's postulates anyway). Second I'll keep the notation of the blog post and say that each participant deposits into addresses D_x (x = A, B, C...).
The Coinshuffle part would work as you say at the start of the above paragraph (it uses a mixnet in the ++ version but whatever, basically we end up with everyone seeing the complete list of receiving addresses without knowing who they belong to, let's say). Part of the output of Coinshuffle could be an ordering (I believe that's trivial) or even if not, the ordering can be determined by a pre-agreed algorithm, even something stupid like lexicographical. That allows everyone to agree on the D_x - receiving address mapping. Then in the execution phase we just broadcast signatures; we still need it that the ones who broadcast their signatures first, get the earlier locktimes, but that doesn't screw up the anonymity, because the signatures are only tied to the inputs, not the outputs.
Yeah, sorry I didn't really go into this and research it carefully, but I was more interested in the general idea than the specific protocol. Right now though I don't see why it wouldn't work.


Yes the terms can be a little confusing but I basically get what you're saying (the usual concept of Chaumian bank is to mint tokens intended to have financial value, even if pegged, but a Chaumian server used for coordination with blinding may use 'tokens' in a less financial sense, also).

It ought to be obvious that adoption at a *consumer* level cannot possibly be fast, but amazingly it really isn't to most.
I've long been of the opinion that the majority in the West are kind of "psychologically saturated" with consumerism and so cannot see anything in any other terms. Notice how all "technology" coverage in the media is just about the latest smartphone or gadget. In our society almost nobody builds anything any more except pretty user interfaces for screens.
Hence the 2013 bubble of "adoption" was all people in bars paying with QR codes because obviously Bitcoin could *only* be interesting as a way of buying coffee, right? Never mind that all the *actual* usage up to that time had been edgy, political, dangerous stuff: Wikileaks, drugs, gambling. And when the general public realized that they just switched off from Bitcoin, which was entirely appropriate. It *isn't* a consumer technology; if there is a consumer adoption phase in future it will certainly not be "raw Bitcoin" - which is uncensorable, raw, hard money, something that requires seriousness and realistically decidedly non-zero fees - such a broadcast layer cannot possibly scale up x1000 or x10000 - but it could be Lightning or more likely another layer on top of that.

You're right in the really terrible scenario of say &gt; 75% of miners refusing to support the chain that the general userbase wants, then (a) we could see some ultra-high delay until the difficulty adjusts down and (b) more importantly, the previous miners could attack the  userbase's chain at will. 
In that scenario a hardfork may have to include a switch in PoW hashing algorithm to render the miners impotent. But it's of course a kind of nuclear option, which hurts everyone in the very short term (but kills miners economic power in Bitcoin permanently, i.e. arguably they're the ones that have more to lose).
Bitcoin's consensus mechanism is sticky/has a lot of inertia. Probably it wouldn't have got this far otherwise.

It's using Joinmarket, not a centralized mixer (with extremely high probability, but not certainly) for the initial sequence of transactions (including the ids you mentioned) at least.


? No, that address is used once only (once paid into, once paid out of). It will almost certainly be a Joinmarket wallet generated address.


I'm not sure that one's really special, but yeah it's kinda ~ the "end" in as much as almost the entirety of the 400 has by then moved through "coinjoin outputs" and is therefore much harder to identify, even to make smart guesses.

Fungibility is a tricky topic here. Some people will tell you that fungibility is entirely binary, either something *is* or *isn't*, full stop. It's a tempting but superficial perspective. For example, for a period there were stories of people in Europe rejecting Euros with the serial codes of the Greek national bank. Euros and other cash notes are almost perfectly fungible, but they have serial numbers.
With bitcoin, it's less fungible than banknotes generally, if people use it in simple, thoughtless ways - and wallet software has a big hand to play in that. The obvious one is address reuse.
But at a more fundamental level, there is a "facility for fungibility" because bitcoin transactions map several inputs to several outputs. Contrary to what Satoshi wrote in the whitepaper, it is *not* safe to assume that all inputs come from the same participant. Coinjoin transactions do not follow that rule. Moreover, if coinjoin transactions have equal sized outputs, you have fundamentally no way to know who the equal sized outputs belong to, even if you do know who the inputs belong to. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 18:40:21
Well said.
Let me repeat what's been said in earlier discussions on this topic: the fundamental distinguishing factor with a cartel-of-banks-blockchain is that you have fixed identities. This means that mining is unnecessary in as much as ledger updates can be signed. Irreversibility in that context is trivially achieved (but only by consensus!) with hashes. These two primitives - the digital signature and the cryptographic hash function - are decades old, they are nothing new. Call them a 'blockchain' if you like, it's a bit like calling a go-kart a rocket ship.
It's interesting to note how the *radical openness* of something like Bitcoin enforces an ultra-sticky consensus precisely due to the anonymity and resultant freeness of entry into the system. Take the recent block size debate; enormous effort is required to change consensus in small ways, because we are a global network of unherdable cats :)
Banks will have none of that (and I think proof of stake can suffer here too): 10 banks get together and make a system, everyone knows the participants and politics can start its magic to allow the most powerful to enforce actions (chain forks e.g.) on the weak. So even a "blockchain" will not enforce settlement finality for contracts that have existence outside the chain's logic.
Having said all that, I don't think there is *nothing* to the idea of using Bitcoin as an inspiration for an improvement to settlement networks; it's just that really all they're doing is waking up to cryptographic solutions they should have started using a decade or more ago.

There are limits to printing somewhere even for the strongest nations; we just don't know where they are. Japan is the most interesting case today (and has been for a long while). There basically is no JGB "market" today.

One reason to prefer paying online charges with Bitcoin is it's a better security model (no credentials passed otw).
To be honest, Bitcoin aside, such models should already be in use (see e.g. Steve Gibson's SQRL, although I think there are others, and I'm not sure of the details, point is public key crypto has already solved this security problem).
As for "hoard don't spend", meh, while the "you should spend it to support the currency" argument is indeed flawed, it's not *100%* wrong, there is some value in using it. But the more fundamental counterargument is, spending doesn't preclude you just buying some more back (of course not $10 at a time)
The other argument against spending, that fees are too high, is totally fine, I can agree with that for sure for payments sub $50 and probably sub $100, albeit fees are variable.

Create a central bank or bank-type institution to hold the reserves. These reserves can be made publically auditable (do a search on "proof of reserves" and "Bitcoin". Make the notes literally certificates redeemable to a certain amount of bitcoin.
Unfortunately you'd still have to have the technology of printing banknotes, which is far from trivial to do well.
Cynical thought: the reason that local currencies like "the Bristol Pound" are tolerated is because the government / bankers know they are crap and won't really work. If someone actually did this in a town, I suspect they'd come down on you like a ton of bricks. Because it would, most likely, work extremely well.

This is a fundamental misunderstanding. The value proposition of "raw" bitcoin is uncensored value transfer; that is not affected by layers of credit built on top of it, and of course such layers cannot be prevented if people want to use them.
You can build censored layers on top of a base uncensored layer, but you cannot do the other way around.
Note that the same argument as above applies to gold, the only difference is that bitcoin is transferrable globally and effectively infinitely portable. So gold's censorship resistance is a bit eroded by e.g. the difficulty of crossing a border with it.
As for paper contracts and shorting, we already have them on bitcoin exchanges.

Without referring to specific companies, I agree with your broad theme that it isn't the companies that are responsible for the insane restrictions placed on control of one's own money.
However, a caveat: I think responsible bitcoin exchanges and brokers should show **clear** warnings to new users that their terms and conditions can **change at any time due to government edicts and that therefore funds withdrawal is at no time guaranteed**. It would help people to think twice about *ever* leaving money on there.
People are shortsighted and greedy and would still leave money on there to trade, but then they could never complain when the terms of service are changed in a blink of an eye and they're locked out without additional rectal exams etc.

Without any comp sci or mathematics or programming background it's clearly harder, but I don't think it's impossible to get a good understanding, at all.
Treat the crypto parts as black boxes : you put something in, and you get something out with such-and-such particular properties. Find out what those properties are and how they fit together.
Some key terms to to get on top of:
Public key cryptosystems ("public key/private key", "public key encryption")
Cryptographic hash functions
Digital signatures
Timestamp servers (a fairly minor, simple concept but very important to the design of Bitcoin)
There ought to be tons of videos and articles addressing these. Wikipedia is excellent, but can be a bit dispiriting sometimes if you don't have any of the background knowledge, because it tends to dive into technical/formal details immediately.
What I'd recommend is to take  as your starting point. It misses tons of details but the whole *idea* of the system is there. You will *not* understand the technical parts (iirc starting at section 2) at first. But if you're persistent you can get there.

This concept that what the author calls "bearer bonds" (I just use the term 'cash' but that's a bit sloppy) - a thing which you own independently of a third party account - is somehow a horrifically bad idea in all circumstances, is just downright stupid, no matter how much he dresses it up with vocabulary.
Trading in IOUs instead of cash has its advantages, but only assuming that third parties are trustworthy, and the advantage must be traded off for efficiency (credit card transaction clearing takes weeks and is massively expensive, either for you, or for your counterparty, or because of corporate lobbying, the cost is passed on to everybody).
I found this phrase particularly telling: 


Note how subversion is worse than criminality. As if your government has an inalienable right to control your wealth, effectively. I find this attitude really depressing. We must try to counter the narrative that's constantly pushed down our throats that the banks have a *right* to know and to censor every transaction you do.

1 is enough. If 1 block doesn't signal segwit, you have to believe that *every* miner signalling bip91 (that should enforce the rejection of non-segwit-signalling blocks), is actually *running* that code. The problem is, we don't know what code they're running. If (worst case scenario) 50% of them are actually running the code and 50% aren't, you get a 50-50 hashrate chain split *just from that one block*. Oops.

It's wrong to lump segwit and sidechains together, they're two very different things. Segwit fixes a fundamental bug in Bitcoin's design, and that fixing enables a whole raft of smart contracting systems to work (best example is Lightning), it also increases the capacity of the network dramatically (about x2). Sidechains is an idea that is quite separate, and has more than one implementation/proposed implementation, plus there's a lot of debate about it, like e.g. the best way to secure a sidechain.
Segwit has been tested for 1.5 years now, has been ready for 7 months, is an unambiguous improvement to Bitcoin (even so called "big blocker" developers agreed on that), and has been maliciously blocked by a small cabal of miners led by Bitmain.

On the second: no, it is not confused "in bitcoin". Some people confuse non-confiscatability with fungibility perhaps, but then some people get all kinds of things wrong.
As for confusing untraceability with fungibility, you're right to make the distinction, but it'd be wrong to assume there's no connection. In a perfectly anonymous digital cash, fungibility is achieved, or at least attempted, via untraceability, because there is no basis to distinguish one coin from another. What you correctly point out is that fungibility is still possible without untraceability, but that's a different point. E.g. suppose crude oil is fungible (it isn't really but let's just pretend that WTI crude is all the same chemical composition); a history of one barrel may be perfectly traceable and recordable, but if the legal authorities consider all transfers legitimate, that doesn't affect the fungibility.
And that's the point: you should be thinking of fungibility in **adversarial** terms - that's what matters here. The entire design of Bitcoin is based on adversarial thinking - how to defend the monetary function from attack. From that point of view, fungibility is fundamentally dependent on some degree of untraceability. Necessary even if not sufficient.

Mimblewimble as an architecture is very promising (for *scalability*, not necessarily scale, right now). In some future it may exist using bitcoin as a unit of account (e.g. a sidechain), that would be ideal, but it seems to be a way off (although there is code; see grin).
@_date: 2016-07-18 14:08:06
People overemphasize and oversimplify with this catch-all "decentralization" term. There's a lot more to it.
First, transactions are broadcast in public. Therefore a miner cannot censor without everyone knowing, very rapidly, that it's happening.
What's more, for really effective censorship, the centralization has to be ultra-extreme; even 1-5% hashing power could be perfectly acceptable to get a transaction through if there is no rush (and note that this is kind of already true for non-IsStandard() transactions today).
Thirdly, even if mining is massively centralized into one or two parties, that doesn't mean that others are not free to take part. At the extreme, with outrageous/egregious behaviour on the part of miners, the users of the network are free to simply switch to a different PoW algo and make the miners irrelevant, overnight.
Now this last is the nuclear option, which would create at least temporary chaos - but much like MAD in the nuclear world, the very existence of the option is what's important (game theoretic).
The whole rube goldberg "blockchain" design has **as its entire point** censorship resistance. Thus, miners "undermining" that property are destroying the exact thing they're working hard to defend. So Satoshi's old economic argument about the 51% attack very much applies, and in the political scenario where that fails (2 or 3 miners, govts apply pressure), then the nuclear option above makes it really very dubious for govts or other powerful entities to try such a "takeover".

If there were overwhelming consensus that having up to 8MB blocks was safe, then it would be, *if* it followed the standard open source development process (BIP, pull request).

Ironically, today you could probably send a transaction for zero fee on the bitcoin network. Coinbase is not estimating accurately (but not blaming them per se, lots of other wallets aren't either), if in fact that fee is specifically a Bitcoin transaction fee (I'm not a user, so just surmise). They should give users options too though, ideally.
For the last few months though, fees to get typical (~230byte) transactions through in a reasonable time (let's say 1 hour) spiked as high as $2-$3. During this time (and it may well recur), obviously, there is a lower limit on the size of a transaction that makes any sense, and it's not $2.

Segwit does increase the block size. It doubles it.
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:05:21


For the 5 billionth time, segwit is a block size increase to ~ 2MB, so it is exactly what is being blocked by miners, not by Bitcoin Core. If you want a reason why not 2MB, ask them (don't expect any real answer though!).


Doubling the weight limit implies 4MB max under normal conditions and 8MB theoretical limit. Whether that is not viable or not is a bit of a different question to 2MB, right? I can't say for sure myself, but it seems quite extreme; do you really think we can handle a 400% increase in throughput rate at the moment? Are you even aware that without the tireless efforts of developers increasing the performance of ecdsa operations by *7 times*, the whole thing would probably have fallen over already?


I would caution you to possibly revisit where you are getting your information. Unfortunately *most* of the Bitcoin media is *atrociously* bad, also these issues are *highly* technical so it's very hard to get a good, clear picture.
As for "against hardfork precedent" it's a bit more than that - it's more that you can't really force a hardfork in any contentious situation without disastrous consequences. But this last point is more debatable. What I will say is, don't be misled into thinking there's some kind of religious position against hardforks, it's more about under what circumstances that they should be done, and how they're done. The right way to understand this particular situation is (a) it's considered that 2MBish is a reasonable conservative first step (b) it *can* be done with a soft fork, so that's definitely preferable (less disruption). And don't forget that segwit is fundaentally about something else, not the size increase, and that that itself was a compromise with demand for scale increase.

Other people will be sure it's ASICBOOST, I never thought that was the main issue, although it's very obscure (it clearly *is* an  issue, generally, but that's another question).
I also think the focus on "Blockstream" is just a convenient target. The main "problem" for Jihan is that Core development is *independent* of the miners and not under their direct control.

These kind of approaches are well known, but are not 100% secure against malware.
The sensible thing to do with very high value wallets and transactions is sign the transactions on an offline, airgapped machine and transfer the signed txs to an online machine for network broadcast. Very valuable private keys are best kept permanently offline.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:35:53
Note that while tps is unlimited, or at least incredibly high, number of users the system can support certainly isn't.

Not disagreeing, but you *must* think adversarially in a system like Bitcoin. Don't just consider what people are likely to do, but also what people might choose to do to either (a) give themselves a Bitcoin-related advantage, (b) attack Bitcoin for a non-Bitcoin related advantage or (c) just for the lulz.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:32:11


Transactions are propagated pretty reliably, simply by broadcast. You can check if your transaction has good propagation by putting the transaction id into the search bar in various blockchain explorers (smartbits, blockchain.info, blocktrail are three, there are tons more). It should show up there as "unconfirmed" as soon as they have it. In my experience this rarely takes more than a few seconds (unless the blockexplorer is having trouble for some reason). "At least 50%" - that'd be a lot harder to find out, fundamentally you can't know for sure what people have on their own, private nodes.

Essentially no one is arguing for that. Segwit increases the block size to ~ 2MB, so anyone telling you that segwit is being blocked in *preference* for a 2MB block size is lying or uninformed.

I still use it regularly for online payments where possible (example - flight), but they're payments of $20-$500. So most of the time even a $1 fee (and it's generally smaller than that) is economical enough, and it's more convenient and more secure (I'm not passing credit card credentials to the service provider).
There are downsides to using it for retail payments, and if the fees continue to go up, that's another negative, but there are upsides too; sometimes it's a good option.

To be fair, there is a disadvantage with sending e.g. to an exchange, rather than just intermediate wallets - you have to put trust in another centralized institution while they hold your funds. And not to mention *their* additional hoops for you to jump through.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:53:18
It depends on making reasonable assumptions about how often participants open and close channels. But even if you're talking something very small like once or twice a year (unrealistic), the limits on the size of the chain you're closing into (the Bitcoin blockchain) mean the number of people that can participate is limited. To be clear - it's a lot of people, but it's real-world limited in a way that tps isn't (you can send back and forth on a channel infinitely without closing).

I lived in China for 7 years and counterfeit cash was a significant every day problem in the early years. They even came out of ATMs. I realised after a while that the colour-change-at-an-angle feature was by far the most reliable way to know if a note was fake. It never seemed to fail. Most Chinese people preferred to feel the texture at a certain point in the note but it wasn't nearly as reliable.
Money in a lot of countries doesn't have this feature.

For deposit, maybe that's right. But it's no big deal if you have a bank account in Hong Kong, just convert before sending. Does it make much difference? If you want to actively trade (I never did), then tranding BTC/USD is basically the same as trading BTC/HKD because of the peg.
@_date: 2013-08-14 05:49:46
This is all kindergarten stuff compared to the real battle to come.
Likely, when the politicians get it through their thick heads that once dollars have been converted into BTC, there is *nothing they can do* to control the flow between BTC accounts, they will find a rationale to try to *try to* ban all transfers into and out of BTC.
I can't see how they will succeed on the "into" part - there will always be ways to get fiat into BTC, although they can certainly make it difficult. What worries me is the extent to which they will be successful on the "out of" part - if you cannot operate a business publically receiving BTC, it's going to deal a huge blow to the ecosystem which Bitcoin needs in order to grow.

Ironically, online commerce is not the main thing with Bitcoin right now. Especially not in China. 
Looking at the whole-world perspective, It's much more about: protecting wealth against fiat inflation, defeating capital controls, international remittances and (strangely enough) person-person or person-small business *offline* transactions.
The first few are pretty obvious but difficult to achieve because of governments and banks trying to stop them. The last one seems strange (why am I saying offline transactions are more significant than online?), but you have to remember that BTC is basically cash. A small retailer can accept BTC as cash, (and can offset currency volatility risk with bitpay etc.), avoid 3%+ CC fees, and avoid any possibility of customer fraud. 
Similiar transactions in the online space are actually more difficult - the customer must fully trust the merchant, or otherwise rely on a third party as some kind of arbitrator. There is still *some* consumer side advantage - no identity theft, mainly. And people are working furiously to find ways to make BTC online commerce work well, for example using multisig transactions to at least remove the threat from a rogue arbitrator, but in the absence of really revolutionary systems, online commerce with bitcoin right now is just slightly more convenient than a system using fiat money with a well trusted third party. And not always even that (as you mention about Alipay).

I also considered this, but you may find an alternative is easier and much cheaper: burn a linux live DVD or USB (latter is better in most cases), then boot up an instance not connected to the internet or the hard drive. This makes it almost inconceivable that malware could get at you. Then create a new wallet within that environment and transfer your BTC to it.
I recommend Electrum for this, for various reasons.
Sorry but it just isn't too easy right now for non-technical people to do this, but it's not impossible either.

Yes it was for sure *always* about wresting control of the project. Indeed, the vast majority of the anti-Core brigade tended not to be against segwit except sprinkling bits and pieces of fud here and there to paint it as inferior (and of course lots of trolls talked utter horseshit about it, too). I think they lost that argument totally with the BU fiasco hence the new strategy is a less confrontational "ok we'll let you have your toys but we're in charge". Doubt it'll work, but like a lot of people I don't care too much how they paint segwit activation.

Some of those were just little experiments, other more regular. I might have missed a couple. A lot of people seem to think you can't actually use Bitcoin as currency, it's not true, it's just you can only use it for a small subset of expenses. And yes, fees have gotten high recently, so it's not really suitable for &lt; $50 or so unless you either don't have an option or really don't care. I prefer using it for online payments to credit cards because it's a fundamentally better security model (no credentials transfer). Although it isn't a better *privacy* model with current tech.

I don't know about anyone else, but I was suggesting it (but say reduce by 50% rather than to zero) as a way of showing miners who's boss :) And yeah it was mostly a joke.

A lot of us think that a need to do that would be kind of a failure. If you're really talking segwit + 2MB you're talking about an 8x increase in the actual block size maximum (more practically, it's maybe 6x). Between here and there, we have so many other ways we can increase the scalability of the system without requiring every real participant to download and verify that much data. Examples: schnorr aggregation, Lightning, possibly sidechains (although it's not clear exactly in what sense that relates to scalability). Possibly a radical reworking like Mimblewimble can *somehow* be integrated with Bitcoin. Of course if a decade from now things like bandwidth are very different, that changes things a bit, but latency is a big deal too, and the speed of light isn't changing.
None of that directly answers your question of course; but the direct answer is it's really, really hard, because unless you have *overwhelming* consensus it is quite properly near-impossible to make upgrades, *especially* via hard forks which are backwards-incompatible.
A common misconception is that Bitcoin's protocol has a "lack of governance". It has an excess of it, Satoshi never intended the protocol to have "governance", he described it as "more or less set in stone from the start". (Hashpower is governance of converging on one transaction history, it is completely orthogonal to this problem.)

This is not a huge problem. Speaking as someone who lived there and over many years transferred a lot of money out of the country, here are your options:
1. For amounts less than ~20kRMB, there is no issue at all. Take it across the border to HK and exchange it anywhere to USD. It's entirely legal.
2. For amounts 20k-50kRMB. The first thing I would say is that the chance of getting stopped if you take this across the SZ-HKD border crossings is effectively zero. Having said that, it's technically illegal. I did it several times. Obviously I can't "advise" it.
3. For larger amounts : each Chinese citizen is entitled to change up to $50k *USD* worth of RMB to foreign currency at the Bank of China (I believe this is per year; check the details). They just provide their identity card. If you, as a foreigner, have a Bank of China or other big bank account, you just have these two steps: Chinese friend makes the RMB cash / USD cash exchange, then you deposit the USD at BoC or similar and do the international wire transfer.
There may be better options too. However the idea of directly taking an RMB amount and sending it overseas is indeed not possible unless you have detailed paperwork justifying it.
Edit: I forgot to say there are places in Shenzhen where you can buy foreign currency directly as a foreigner, without going through a Chinese friend. I don't know the reason this is allowed, or what the limit is, but I guess there is a limit.

No, that's right, not mutually exclusive. I was describing, in a case where segwit + 2MB happened, how further scaling can be achieved (not that I think the + 2MB thing is a good idea, but with or without it, segwit will help those things happen).


It's not as clear as it seems. Lightning's scalability per second doesn't depend on the block size. Lightning's scalability in terms of number of users, does. But when you start crunching those numbers you're already talking about a much, much bigger userbase than today. Let's not try to run before we can walk. Well, I guess, a lot to say on this topic.


If you're talking about bugfixes and other completely uncontroversial minor or technical changes, the answer is the open source development process centred at  If you're talking about bigger architectural changes, it's still the same, but it's much more difficult - see the drama around segwit; however irrational I might think it is, it's an example of that difficulty I was mentioning. In future, the "set in stone" should be actualised imo, the protocol should freeze, but the good news is, you can move the innovation onto higher layers, as long as the base layer keeps its key uncensorability property. Higher layers could be trust based (see e.g. Coinbase) or trustless like Lightning (or possibly sidechains, it's a less clear case because the technology isn't completely well-defined afaik).

If they didn't do replay protection properly, I would have been *forced* to interact with it. I don't want to and can't be bothered, got enough things to do.
 
Also passivity is not in principle a bad approach even if I did have time for it; let the market decide if this new altcoin has any worth, come back to it in some months.
My personal feeling at the moment is it's not going to work in any meaningful sense, at least initially for a number of reasons, technically dubious, rushed, there's no real support from users, businesses (a lot of whom signed up to NYA, appalling as that is); but it could chug along with some turbulence in the background at a low value level, and be there as something disgruntled people could switch to; or, a segwit2x HF may supersede it.

I've been banging this drum a bit too. E.g. last month I probably did around 20-30 on-chain transactions, through at least 3 different wallets. My confirmation times varied from sub 1 minute (someone I was paying was quite amazed by that!) to ~ 30 minutes maximum, because I consciously was prepared to pay the $1-$2.50 fee. High fees price out a broad class of transactions, and there are cases where you're prepared to wait a day, but there are others where you aren't. Bitcoin got *very* expensive to use - but it did *not* get "slow" as every single media idiot will tell you.

I'm not even sure if that's true, to be honest. There's bitcoinQt, multibit, electrum, Armory, hive, darkwallet, kryptokit all either well established or in heavy development. There's also blockchain.info, coinbase, coinpunk on the web. I'm sure there are several others I've forgotten. There has been huge improvement in wallet software even just this year.
I guess I'm not really disagreeing with you so much as arguing it's the development *around* the core wallet functionality that's needed. Cold storage and other client-side security needs to be easier (e.g. Trezor) and better, merchant-customer interactions need to continue to improve, but the biggest area of need is in fiat-BTC transfer. Attempts to solve that problem are going on at a frenetic pace, but they are of course not purely technological. The question for all these problems (wallet security, currency transfer) is how much we can take trust out of the system, and where we put whatever trust remains.

Meanwhile it did occur to me that I was kind of describing localbitcoin :) But while what they do is great, it doesn't have the decentralized p2p element (and that p2p software can do other stuff, like reputation as you say) and also I don't think they've set up escrow properly (not really sure about that).

Not a problem with bitcoin. A problem with your money. You are currently discovering that what you think of as an excellent store of wealth (dollars in bank accounts or paypal accounts) have severe limitations.
Make it obvious you are buying or selling bitcoins with you paypal or bank dollars - they will shut you down, and stop you spending what you think is your own money.
They will charge you fees for using your own money.
And, because *at their discretion*, a payment you make can be reversed at any time by them (paypal, credit cards and in some cases banks), holders of real money (bitcoin) will not transfer to you because the risk of fraud you represent.
Worth thinking about.

Pretty much the entire effort from "Core" (which just means the people who voluntarily take part in the open source project which is Bitcoin) for the last 2 years has been to avoid a split. The way to do it was packaged into segwit: allow a block size increase (segwit more or less *doubles* the block size maximum), while also allowing for a much smarter more scalable way for Bitcoin to work (see: malleability, Lightning). This has been available for over 6 months, and as a soft fork, which removes the risk of a split, it only requires miners to cooperate; users don't need to do anything. There are no real downsides to segwit, it's been tested for over a year.
So in short, no, that's not how it is.

Whether it literally exists in the code or not is not the point (afaik it does but maybe the parameter name is changed?); the code logic *must* still enforce that rule, otherwise it would be a hard fork (any relaxation of rules is a hard fork which can cause a chain split, since old and new nodes would disagree).

I think I  overstated the loss potential to the issuer, but the basic principle works.
Your main argument against what I'm saying is this I think:


This is where my comment "the market always knows more than any of its participants" comes in. Scenario: in some side-channel market like IRC bitcoin-otc someone comes along and starts offering 500 usdcoins for 400USD bank transfer. Rumor spreads - did you hear, people are selling usdcoins cheap? The market will form an opinion about usdcoin's true value whether you want it to or not.
 Then everyone wants out of usdcoin via Bob, since he is the only market participant forced by the rules to sell at above market price.

True, but there is a subtle difference between a bank account number and a bitcoin address. A bitcoin address private key is access to cash - there is no counterparty. A bank account number is an IOU, with counterparty risk - see for example Cyprus.

"In MultiSigna we are going to facilitate your bank account to the other participant in the transaction in order to perform the fiat transfer. Also, if there is a problem with the transaction due to negligence or bad actions by one of the parts, we are going to ask for your bank statements and the transfer voucher.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe a dead man's switch could be implemented within the Bitcoin protocol itself, using scripts. The general dead man's switch idea is problematic, except here if it's just going to your wife or something and you forgot, the worst that could happen is she'd have your bitcoins and might be prepared to give them back :)
Also, Mike Hearn in his 2012 presentation suggested the use of oracles reading from public registries of death certificates, but since I don't think such registries exist online in any reliable way, I'm not sure how close to reality that is.

Although I take alternative currencies seriously as a general phenomenon, I am not "scared" of them, in the sense that for any one of them to become important will take time. Bitcoin is dominating right now due to the network effect. Other cryptocurrencies may come to challenge Bitcoin, but not in the space of a day or even a month. So I think all Bitcoin enthusiasts should pay attention to the competition.
At the core of these worries, which I think all of us in the community think about from time to time, is not so much that something else might beat Bitcoin to dominance, but that somehow a proliferation of different cryptos will result in us falling back into exactly the kind of inflationary printing madness that this was designed to avoid. 
Let's not underestimate how *spectacularly* difficult it is to get a new currency off the ground, from scratch. Bitcoin took years to even get started, despite an incredibly well thought out incentive scheme and a very powerful sales pitch as long as you were smart enough/techie enough to understand it. What is litecoin's sales pitch? It's slightly more convenient? The network effect is going to be like this massive gravitational pull dragging merchants and users towards bitcoin and making it very difficult for something like litecoin to gain traction. But who knows?
Meanwhile I'm a bit more interested in the other projects like namecoin (OK maybe not a direct competitor) or freicoin because at least they are bringing something new to the table.

This is more important than people understand. It's actually not true that bitcoin isn't backed by anything physical. It's backed by physical work.
The distributed timestamp server invented by Satoshi is based on his solution to the Byzantine generals problem: how to achieve concensus in a trustless network. The solution is based on nodes in the network doing work. If the ability to do such work were not limited by physical constraints, then anyone clever enough could mount a 51% attack by solving the puzzles quicker than anyone else.
(This, by the way, is why ideas to do "useful" computation instead of the "useless" hash checking are wrongheaded).
 Now it's true that that work is computation, but the limitation on the speed of computation is itself physical. That's why the huge hashing power is important. Bitcoin is protected by work (in the exact, Physics, sense of the term). So it is not virtual at all, it is physically real.

In 'the bubble is us' she opines that Bitcoin is the Napster of this new revolution. A basic error. And then this:


David Birch’s view was that it’s probably close to zero, though, he did concede that the community-based tech that underpins the system may have some intrinsic value.
So, might Bitcoin’s value be linked to its capacity to incentivise people to learn about computing, programming and cryptology and generally to think about the nature of money and value? No. He didn’t see that as value inducing."
That's the best she can come up with. Read my comment at the end (AdamISZ).
This is after months of coverage, the initial articles contained pretty outrageous basic errors about the technology.
I'm not saying it's all 100% wrong. But what's been written on FTAV about bitcoin is wrong in very important ways.
I've also followed FTAV for a long time, as it's got such a lot of interesting perspectives. Which is why this annoys me :)

Clarification: SHA256^2 PoW is not part of the definition of Bitcoin (I believe the whitepaper mentions "such as" sha2, if that matters). But, your quote there is ambiguous, if you meant "changing from PoW to another e.g. PoS" then I'd agree, although others wouldn't.

I don't get where the confusion is. If you choose to remember the seed phrase (12 words), rather than print them on paper, you just enter that phrase in a new install, and you regenerate your wallet.

With regard to the four-point comparison: you're ignoring the fact that bitcoin gives *both* of the properties we're discussing: security and no middleman fees. Right now, consumers generally prefer cards and merchants (in small stores anyway) will generally prefer cash. With Bitcoin that choice doesn't need to be made.
Having said that, I generally agree with you :) The big picture for bitcoin is the combination of decentralization (meaning no middle man) and security. It will matter a lot more for things like international transfer, micropayments, programmable money (escrow etc.) and secure wealth storage with no fees.
It will never beat centralized systems for convenience, but there's nothing stopping people building centralized systems on top of it for certain scenarios (see 'off-chain transactions').

It's kind of interesting to think about. Small self contained modules/packages doing "one thing and one thing well" can for sure have complete test coverage. I think the core EC engine of Bitcoin (libsecp256k1) has enormous testing effort put into it (whether it's "100% coverage" or not I couldn't tell you, wouldn't be surprised). But the thing is when you try to reduce this to as simple a measure as coverage, you can get led astray.
I guess in practice it mostly matters that you have good separation of layers such that it's possible to unambiguously state "these tests prove that it won't leak your private key or destroy your coins" without having to test all aspects of the network layer interactions. So the above comments about libsecp256k1 would be relevant, along with the wallet stuff.

There is a black market for various things - and one of them is money, well, in a way. Macau is used by government officials and gangsters (same thing really) to launder money and for gambling trips. But you can't take more than a few thousand across the border legally. So there's a huge business in money transfer ahem "agents" at the Zhuhai/Macau border.
Moreover there are a lot of very rich people in China who do not feel secure in their positions and want out. An easy way to get money abroad without a paper trail would be a real "killer app" for them.

If the former, are you talking about transactions on websites or exchanges which are not actually processed on the blockchain? Where a company would be storing the transactions in its own internal ledger?

Sure the fractional reserve situation would be bad, so let's assume that doesn't happen. My concern is more a case like this: if the usdcoin is fairly valued, by the market, *for whatever reason* (the market always knows more than any of its participants) at 0.9 usd then everyone would immediately want to sell their usdcoins for usd, back to the issuer. If he's operating according to some rule that says he *must* make that transfer, he's basically losing all his money (not just losing some profit, but **all his capital**), since when they've all been traded, usdcoin has been removed from circulation and proved useless. If on the other hand he is *not* obliged to make the transfer according to the rules, then usdcoin floats freely and doesn't perform its role of being a mirror of usd value.
This is the problem with all artificial pegs - markets eventually force honesty in assessment of the value of an asset - the only exception being actual physical coercion, as in the case of government capital controls. And eventually, even that doesn't work.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:52:32
Here's some possible reasons for real world use:
1. Merchants in stores aren't getting charged usurious fees like they are with cards, and even if you don't care about them, they can reduce their prices to share that gain with you.
2. An in-person transaction of 2$ looks the same as a transaction of $2000, to anybody in the vicinity watching. This is great for security, compared with cash.
3. Connected to 2, if you already walk around with a phone, you only gain in security by replacing cash in your wallet with bitcoin on your phone. The presence of security measures like passwords also *greatly* increases the complexity and cost from the perspective of a thief.
4. Cash can be counterfeited, bitcoin cannot.
Disadvantages: mainly, the confirmation delay (but you can safely ignore it for small amounts). And right now, of course, there is a huge disadvantage that very few merchants accept bitcoin, but that's changing.

The analogy is better phrased like this: the government creates a law saying that yes, you can use a car, but you have to prove that your usage is not aiding and abetting drug dealers or terrorists. Car companies sell cars with embedded chips allowing them to "freeze" the car at any point, according to their own discretion. If your driving pattern gets flagged (driving in a known drug dealing zone for example, or driving "around it" in a deliberate attempt to not seem like a drug dealer (see "structuring")), your car is immediately frozen, and you can then beg the car company to switch it back on. Which is entirely at their discretion, according to the contract you had no choice but to sign when you bought it.
That is "AML".

Simple answer: ssl encryption is not free, nowhere near free actually in terms of resources; not so much on bandwidth, but on cpu. The underlying cryptographic primitives on which public key encryption are based hit cpus pretty hard; this is why we have the cpu-gpu-asic development in bitcoin. In fact, the whole complex structure of ssl, using asymmetric keys to bootstrap symmetric keys came out of the impracticality of using asymmetric keys for data transfer (maybe not the only reason, but an important one).

Good questions. There's a few answers here.
1: don't mix ebay/paypal/credit card with bitcoin, for the reason you point out: it's not safe if one side is reversible.
2: Is there a bitcoin escrow? Yes and no. Yes - built in to the protocol itself is a mechanism that allows this - look up "multisig addresses". However, it requires a third party to arbitrate dispute. Why "no"? Because very few people are actually doing this yet. One example of how it's working is localbitcoins - the company itself arbitrates disputes, but this is only for money exchange, not for merchants selling goods. Bottom line is that this whole area still needs a lot of work, although the technology is already basically ready.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:15:37
Think of security w.r.t. bitcoin as like security with cash. It is actually much better, but only when you understand it in detail.
Here's what I mean: if you didn't have a bank account, you would have to address two security issues in your financial dealings. (1) You have to keep your savings secure. This might be by using a big steel safe, or by burying it in an unknown location, or putting it in various lock boxes, or knowing someone you *really* trust, and asking them to keep it secure. (2) For your day to day expenses, you'd take a small amount out of that secure stash and carry it around in a wallet.
It's very much like that with bitcoin at the moment; your savings have to be kept in something like a safe. But this doesn't mean just storing on your laptop, it means finding a way to store them so there's *no* possibility of a hacker getting at you. Your every day, live, PC, connected to the internet clearly does not qualify. That would be like storing your cash on the kitchen table. For every day spending, you take a bit out and put it on a not-so-secure device that you can carry around, or store in some web wallet like blockchain.info.
As the bitcoin ecosystem develops, there may be better large companies that can store your bitcoins in a way you trust, but we are nowhere near that imo. Even then, techies will still prefer, and be able, to store their own bitcoins in an outstandingly secure way, with no counterparty risks and no real costs. But it will require some diligence.

The truth is there will never be some kind of final confirmation that (a) they will not deny a wire transfer or (b) your account will not be terminated for any time at their discretion. This is not just the lopsided nature of the relationship between banks and their customers (which I understand, is not so bad with credit unions as with large banks), but also the nature of the regulatory environment. Even if they were entirely accommodating to bitcoin the government can tell them to change their policy at any time and they have no choice but to comply.

Perhaps making such an artificial near-8MB block could do something nasty to your mining adversaries? i.e. give an unfair advantage? Perhaps it could do nasty things to ordinary nodes which you might leverage in some way? I don't know. I think having this kind of risk at 4MB is already pretty bad - maybe? I leave it to others to analyze it, I don't have the ability.

It's a surprisingly unclear issue; there are no laws in place with regard to the great firewall itself; in some sense the government doesn't even acknowledge its existence. Therefore technologies to get around it aren't banned in an explicit way I think. There *are* laws and public campaigns against spreading, well, dissent essentially. Disrupting the public order etc.; I forget the exact terms they use but then it's all just Orwellian newspeak anyway.
The general public are not really that bothered about the great firewall; they're more concerned (if they're concerned about the internet at all) about censorship on their social media platform du jour. 
So to answer your question I have never heard of anyone being warned/contacted/fined/prosecuted or anything like that for using a VPN. If you were using it as a political activist or something, it's the activism they'd be interested in rather than the technology you use.

We all go through these feelings, even those of us that haven't sold any (except to buy things). You can (a)Spread your purchases out over time to reduce the importance of one particular price. (b)Go all in in one shot.
I think the more important thing is a sober estimate of what percentage of your savings you can/should put into this. Make a clear decision about that and don't let the price affect you too much. Don't forget, there is a danger (however small it seems) in keeping your money in fiat in banks, too.

The authoritative version of the blockchain is always the one with the longest chain of blocks (strictly speaking the largest total work, but it comes to the same thing in practice). Not all nodes will be in a correct, "current" state all the time; some may have failed to get the latest block, some will be temporarily in an incorrect state, on a branch with a smaller number of blocks, but since mining (calculating block hashes) takes a lot longer than network latency, over time any node operating correctly will right itself and get back on track.
If the entire network stopped and then one or two nodes came back up, then in order to continue the same blockchain, at some point a node would have to arrive with a correct version. In theory the "new" network could start mining a different blockchain, although it would still have to start with the genesis block. You can imagine all kinds of messy scenarios there. If a single node came back online with the real blockchain you'd have a disaster because the difficulty would be far too high for a single miner to produce new blocks. Of course how such a disaster could occur in the first place is the real question.

This must be the most common misconception about Bitcoin; that mining is meaningless work.
To give an example - suppose the computational power of the network were used to solve, as you suggest, Physics problems. What would happen if someone found a quicker way to solve that problem? It can happen at any time.
Bitcoin nodes find hashes. The reason hash functions were chosen is because they have a very special set of properties. The most critical one is that the output is not in any way predictable from the input. This is what allows mining to be both fair and predictable probabilistically. Incrementing a nonce by 1 gives the same probability of success as incrementing a nonce by 2. Randomness is key to achieving this special property.
A correct hash confirms that, on average, a certain amount of work was done and critically is linked deterministically to the content of the transaction block that's being confirmed. This couldn't be achieved with other unrelated forms of work.

1) There's a mixture of solutions. As well as internet transfer, there's transfer over cellphone networks (see MPesa in Kenya). In very primitive or remote areas, bitcoin isn't particularly relevant but a situation could arise in which people exchange paper tokens representing bitcoin (it MIGHT happen, but it wouldn't matter very much if it did or did not).
2) Not really a question about bitcoin, bitcoin was never designed to be an "insurance policy against the collapse of society". Just a protection against money debasement and a true and effective form of digital cash.
 It is possible however, that bitcoin turns out to be so disruptive to the existing power structures that we go through a long period of very great political turmoil. I think that's not likely - not even the internet managed to be that disruptive.

China may have 4 times the population of the US, but 3 of those 4 are very poor (20 years ago it was 3.9 so it's big progress).
If China gets into "industrial scale" mining it will be because some local government official or son of a Politburo member has decided it would be a profitable little side business and buys a billion dollars worth of mining equipment (somehow!). China doesn't have a natural competitive advantage in this area because its only natural advantage was always its huge population of willing low wage workers (guess I'm slipping off into another topic here..).

Unlike the other commenter I don't have a negative comment on the article overall, but I think this is worthy of critique: everyone's very "sure" that Bitcoin has a problem with scaling and apparently Ethereum is better.
But there is no sense to this whatsoever imo; Ethereum's scaling properties are *way worse* than Bitcoin's, and will only be "solved" by basically entirely giving up on the concept of replacing trust with cryptographic verification. i.e. not solved at all, just as the danger of complexity of smart contracting has not been solved but simply replaced with political consensus on outcome in the case of the DAO disaster.

Wise words from Mr mmmm here. I have only been confused about one thing this year in the Bitcoin world, and that's China. I lived in that country for a LONG time and have a good idea about the culture, and it made zero sense to me that the government would allow Bitcoin. It turned out they were just exceptionally slow getting round to it (assuming it's a de facto ban as some people are saying).
Indeed the banning of "hard currency" in the USSR just made it all the more obvious to the people how un-free they were. In China the elites may end up using BTC for their money laundering, while the little people will be forbidden and this will just make things worse.

Have you had any success in buying bitcoins yourself, from Ukraine? It sounds like it's difficult.

To get good advice, you're going to need to say what software context you're working in. Are you using Bitcoin QT? bitcoind? Electrum? Some particular website for escrow? etc.
Basically you need to deserialize the raw tx to see its contents (in particular, you need look at the output(s) of the transaction).
in bitcoind it's:
decoderawtransaction &lt;tx hash&gt;
in Electrum it's something similar.
You also need to sign the raw transaction with your private key once you're happy, of course.
None of this should be exposed to you as a user. Again, context of question would help.
A little tool I built here:  makes it fairly easy for the user. Look at the bottom of the readme for how it's used (at least on the command line).
 You just sign, and specify the output address and amount when you sign. If a counterparty has sent a sig with a different address or amount, the transaction will just fail when it's broadcast, so you don't really need to check.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:55:24
In Electrum you can convert everything to millibits. I did it months ago, and I'm used to it now.
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:16:33
It doesn't; the blockchain stores that information. If the seed generates addresses 1A... 1B... and 1C... first time, and you put some money into them, then when you type in the seed again later, Electrum regenerates the addresses, then it can ask the Electrum server to look on the blockchain and find out how much each address has in unspent outputs.

Any address can send funds to two addresses; and indeed, a large proportion of transactions on the network right now act like this. The most common type of transaction is A--&gt;(B,C) where A is your address, B is the address of your counterparty you're sending money to, and C is another one of your addresses, holding the change (the amount left over from what you earlier held in A).
In general, a Bitcoin transaction can have any non-zero number of inputs and any number of outputs. If the sum of the inputs (which are themselves *outputs* from previous transactions) is bigger than the sum of the outputs, the remainder is given to the miner as a transaction fee.
Now, the exact types of transactions that your wallet shows you will almost certainly be limited. But at the software level, any combination is possible. You can look up 'createrawtransaction' in the bitcoind API, but that will be too technical to be useful for most people. Take a browse around the bitcoin wiki, especially the section on "Transactions".
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:58:44
There seems to be some confusion around here - Electrum allows you to use deterministic address generation AND allows you to have a brainwallet - because by remembering the seed, you have remembered everything necessary to generate the entire wallet (i.e. all addresses).
You are right about random generation of seed of course.

The deeper answer is because money is power. That power will not be given away to an autonomous and anonymous decentralised group, with no central point of failure, easily. And no this is not a conspiracy theory - no conspiracy is required, it's just lots of individuals and groups convincing themselves that they're doing the "right" thing (example 'anti-money laundering') when what they're actually doing is supporting their own self-interest.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:53:08
Here's the beautiful part: you don't need to backup your wallet :)
Electrum will give you a seed phrase (12 words). Write them down and do not lose them under any circs.
You should also create a password for sending the coins. Obviously, you shouldn't lose that either.
After that, you can download the Electrum software anywhere on earth, type back in the seed, and  you're good to go.
No matter what you spend or receive, there's no need to create backups.

I think you have a good point. My response is that there may be some arguable use for a futures contract for a product which can be delivered *near*-instantaneously, but really there's no need to argue about it. Let the market decide if it has any value.
My guess is that a variety of contracts will prove to be useful for hedging purposes, but that timescales will be drastically compressed. Note how even in the traditional financial markets there has been a move recently in, say, the options market, to allow trading on contracts with very short timescales e.g. the one week options on stocks and stock indices.
In the case of Bitcoin it's not unreasonable to imagine there would be some utility to 24 hour or 1 week contracts; as has often been pointed, e.g. see Taleb's dynamic hedging, in a frictionless market hedging would go on continuously in real time, but even Bitcoin is not totally frictionless.

People keep hoping this is true but it isn't. All bank TOS say something like "we can close your account at any time for any reason".

The ramifications are this: in the current system, elites become entrenched because the source of their wealth is their control on the money supply. In a bitcoin or other finite-supply money system, that control is removed. Does it mean that the distribution of wealth will eventually change? I can't say that, but it makes it much more likely that the distribution of wealth will be more meritocratic over very long time scales, because wealth will naturally flow to those who can provide actual value.

I'm not convinced that 2 of 2 models will ever quite work in practice, even including game theoretic approaches like NashX (iirc).
In 2 of 3 it's possible to create models where the risk of collusion between escrow and one party is reduced by spreading out the escrow trust into a pool of escrows. I'm working on something like this right now. 
Also, the OT guys have been working on something similar:

There is no good reason, nowadays, to use a client which is downloading the whole blockchain. It really amazes me that newbies are still doing this ... I think the Bitcoin community should make it more obvious to them how unwieldy the "standard" Bitcoin client is and, for myself, Electrum is the obvious winner for ordinary users' local storage because:
1. It's lightweight
2. You don't have to backup constantly due to deterministic seed. (so paper/brain wallet is easy)
Armory is powerful but totally unwieldy. Multibit is lightweight like Electrum but as I recall you don't have the deterministic seed functionality so you have to worry about backup and storage media. Also I found I constantly had to resync it with the blockchain.

Your basic position seems to be that Bitcoin's scarcity isn't real because one can create alt-chains and alt-coins.
By the same token, people can use other elements than gold for money, and they do. They also use other physical commodities in some cases.
If part of Bitcoin's perceived value and utility comes from the network effect (which it does), and if no other altcoins offer superior properties as money (which, for now, they don't), then Bitcoin is in a very similar position to gold - it's not totally unique but it's superior to the alternatives.
Meanwhile the gold vs Bitcoin comparison shows an obvious winner - Bitcoin. It can be transferred immediately across the world (and that's just one of many advantages that Bitcoin has over gold, actually).
Meanwhile if an alt-coin shows an obvious superiority to Bitcoin there are two possible eventualities - (1) the superiority will be integrated into the current Bitcoin codebase or (2) everyone will switch to the new coin. Even the latter possibility is not really a problem for Bitcoin investors, since they will be able to shift from one to the other.

Which one do you mean? 100K at a few street level money changers is not a big problem, although you'd probably prefer a bank, but they won't change more than 20K at a time (at least in some cases - such things are never completely clear), certainly if you're converting to HKD. 
If you're converting to EUR or USD in HK it's only a little more difficult. Other currencies is harder. 
Within China it's a different story of course.
Theoretically there are 20K/person/day limits on cash movement across the border but in Hong Kong the law doesn't seem to be applied with any seriousness. It's been that way for many years.

Sure, but: generate on an offline medium (e.g. linux live disk or airgapped laptop, something like that), and check the signature and checksum of the electrum instance you're installing.

True. This curiosity is a result of the fact that there is no such thing as a bitcoin, even at the software level.
Note an identical issue with fiat currency: a British 10 pound note says “I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of 10 pounds”. Same idea.
There is a tiny additional utility in having a non-zero balance: you have the right to make a commitment to a block in the blockchain. With 0BTC, you don't have that right. That's why dust transactions, fees and block size are all tricky issues which have to be addressed: that right should not be costless.

You don't back up the wallet. You use a 12 word seed, which you either remember (brain wallet) or write down (paper wallet). This, plus the password, is what you need to not lose.

No - it will grow *out* of those uses. The more it is used by fringe groups, the more it will be recognised as a valid means of payment. I'm describing history as much as the future. I think you're just being impatient :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:59:54
It's called a "deterministic" wallet. Basically, starting from the seed, you can generate an infinite list of addresses, and it will always be the same list every time you recreate the wallet.
Of course there is a disadvantage: an attacker discovering the seed has access to *all* your addresses at once. It's like a master password.
The advantages vastly outweigh the disadvantages, but you should understand the significance of this and make sure you create your wallet in an offline environment and keep it secret (made much easier by the fact that it's relatively easy to memorise a 12 word sequence and never have it known to any other party).

That's not the "ONLY thing". There also needs to be a way for people to spend bitcoin at home (which in this case sometimes means a third world location). 
If on the other hand you go with a model migrant worker local fiat - bitcoin - broker - home family member - exchange to local fiat, then the two exchange steps and one broker step will struggle to be much better than western union type services, overall. It will be some mix of cheaper and more convenient, hopefully, but not I suspect as much as you'd like. (Because of the broker step and the inability to spend BTC directly in the home country).

Nonsense. At what time in the years 1995-2000 did the Nasdaq achieve 4000% returns, while falling occasionally between 40-80%+?
Bitcoin yearly returns have been in the 1000%+ range for each of the last 4 years as I recall, with one exception (where it was still up). And it has recovered from a nearly 90% crash in 2011.
So as you can see there is absolutely no comparison whatsoever between the nasdaq run up to 2000 and what we have here.

It means giving a lower priority to transactions which use the same bitcoin addresses.

Sure, that's why it says "normally"; nothing was changed.
It's normal practice to use the change address model, and good practice too, but that's not the only way to use the protocol. For example, people sometimes pay out dividends with a lot of outputs, it's more convenient that way and saves tx fees too.

You have a very important misunderstanding here. Superficially, these Japanese and US central banks have failed in their mission, but that's because they have a much more important mission which is not written down clearly: to preserve the status quo. QE and ZIRP in both Japan and the US were done in order to prevent the failure of the large banks and other large institutions. That is their real motivation, and in that they were successful.
This is not conspiracy theory, it is the natural flow of incentives. Hierarchical structures preserve the hierarchy always as their primary goal. Usually, that is not an issue and they can spend some effort on secondary goals. But when it is an issue, they put all available resources to addressing it - in this case, the resource of an infinite printing press.

If we are in a disequilibrium state in which the cost of mining equipment can not be justified by the monetary return, there are two mechanisms by which equilibrium can reestablish itself: either as you suggest the value of the coins mined goes up OR the difficulty reduces (caused by miners stopping mining).
The critical question to me is whether we would ever reach such a disequilibrium; I think it will only happen to a very minor extent if at all (i.e. I think we'll tend to smoothly move through a series of quasi-equilibria as genuinely free markets tend to). 
A *sudden* disruption for whatever reason (e.g. big new technology in ASIC, big miner goes offline) could create some really weird outcomes though.

I'm getting bored of hearing myself say this, but to others who want to avoid this: use Electrum. If OP had done this, they would still have that money. The wallet would still exist on the stolen laptop, but without the password (assuming you used a good one), it would be useless, while you could reinstall your wallet from seed and carry on as normal.
And you'd never have to make a back up.

No tech-savvy person would ever enter their *real* password on such a site, but that's not who this post was for.

The problem with these lines of thinking is, if the rewards come from outside the blockchain, then that party who is making the payments is effectively in control of the blockchain.
If you have a trusted, or equivalently a controlling, third party, there is no need for the complexity (and effort) of a blockchain.
That's why the incentive for mining/processing *has* to be intrinsic to the system.
Also, the decentralised voting systems that a lot of people are getting excited about are also highly problematic because of how you define identities. Again, if you use identities based on some government system, you are again relying on a third party. I'm not completely sure, but it seems like a huge or insurmountable problem for genuinely decentralised voting.

There are a few proposals knocking around. They revolve around blacklist and whitelist concepts.
Wrt 2 - the point is this: that yes, it can and will be the case that if such a system is implemented, a third party will take over the responsibility for you of checking. However, that will destroy the whole point of Bitcoin (read the introductory paragraph of the Bitcoin whitepaper), and the costs will go back to credit card type costs .. in fact it will be worse than credit cards, because there will be no reversibility and you will just be stuck with bad coins.
Just remember: Bitcoin was designed to work like cash, deliberately. If you don't like the irreversibility and fungibility of cash, then don't handle bitcoin directly. Wait for companies to create reversible layers on top of bitcoin, and use that instead. A lot of people will indeed prefer that kind of transaction in many situations, but you will have to pay fees for it. The disaster would be to destroy the underlying irreversible protocol, because then Bitcoin is just an inferior form of electronic payment.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:49:20
2 and 3 are more false than true, really (although of course they have an element of truth). The reason is the miners - if the miners refuse to upgrade to the new software put out by the developers, then nothing would happen. The miners have the votes in Bitcoin. Even "validating nodes" (computers running full bitcoin software but not trying to mine blocks) don't really count, because no transaction will ever make it into a block unless a miner includes it.

True, up to a point. You're right in that there is no "slow failure" mode, IF everyone has easy access to the issuer's dollars at any time.
But if not - if Bob is in the USA and a bunch of people from Europe have bought his usdcoins, then there may be a muddy and imperfect information transfer in the market. If I'm in Germany and I want to know if Bob is honouring his obligations, I'm going to have to trust the gossip on btctalk and so on.
This is how it works with pegs. They work very well until they don't. There wouldn't be any long period where people were selling at 0.98 usd, since as you say, that's stupid except in the disaster scenario. On the other hand, issuers need to publically prove that they always have on hand the requisite number of dollars to balance the oustanding usdcoin to avert accusations of fractional reserve. If they can't do that, or if their proof is imperfect, it's always going to be a delicate balance.
A system like this is fragile and can break, but it can also work for extended periods of time I guess.

The problem is deeper than a lack of understanding of technology. Bitcoin is a threat to the status quo as well as a cool, fashionable new tech. The latter won't really last but the former might.
The sort of people who think Apple in the 2000s represents the pinnacle of technological innovation are not in the least bit interested in getting involved in something that might actually change the world for the better. It's like all those people I notice in the last few years who call themselves "geeks" but spend all day talking about shiny toys.

That's not clear. Notice that in the introduction he talks about the problem of a central mint being that you cannot trust it to over-issue. To the extent that Bitcoin is designed to solve this problem, it is trying to replace current fiat systems entirely. But the paper seems to be agnostic about the mechanics of things like face-face transactions - it's more about creating the "backbone" of a sound form of money in the absence of a mint.

You have a good point in that it's backing just as much as any other form of backing. i.e. it's imperfect - but it may work fine in many cases.

I'd say you're only half right. Bitcoins are perfectly fungible, precisely because they do not exist. When you run bitcoin software, there is no addressable object in memory which represents a bitcoin.
Addresses are different: addresses are a representation of public keys, which certainly do exist. This proposal is an attempt to exploit the potential for addresses to be non-fungible in this sense.
Satoshi originally intended people to use new addresses for each transaction to avoid this potential non-fungibility issue. Whether these people will ultimately be able to exploit this is an open question.
Because of the fungibility of bitcoins themselves, it will be an extremely tricky matter to track addresses in a way that makes any sense.

With Bitcoin as it currently stands, you are better off being your own bank - because none of the existing companies offering bank-like services (storing your private keys and hence your money) are as safe as they might be. It will get better, but that's for the future.
It's like this: imagine if gold had just been discovered and everyone was keen on using this new type of money. You'd have a choice: either store the gold in your house, making you vulnerable to thieves, or giving your gold to one of the new storage companies that are opening up everywhere. Do you really trust any of them? Do they know what they're doing? None of them have been in business more than 2 years.
So if you've got sense, you invest in some kind of safe or arrange some kind of secret burial. Hosting your wallet file on your PC, especially if running Windows, is something like leaving your gold in the kitchen. *Maybe* thieves won't steal it. That's about the best you can say.

Everything is still priced in dollars. So: what you plan to save/invest in bitcoin, go ahead and do so, and what you plan to spend anyway (e.g. some online service or whatever else is useful), convert from dollars to bitcoin, and then spend. Obviously I'm not claiming that's totally convenient for most purchases, but it can be done for some things. My point is that I'm not wasting BTC, I'm buying what I wanted to buy anyway.
And by the way that's still true with the 10kBTC pizza or whatever - he was going to buy the pizza anyway.

What do you mean by "internal business accounts"? Two accounts at the same bank? Or two accounts owned by the same company, with one of them in China/ I'd really appreciate it if you could make it a bit clearer.
From my research it seems that indeed wire transfers are reversible in the case of fraud or error, but it would of course be necessary for both banks to agree to it. That means there needs to be clear evidence for it, and I would guess in most cases it takes a fair amount of time. So it's nothing like Paypal etc. One cannot just demand a reversal because one feels like it.

They may or may not have full and ultimate control. There is a very realistic use case where non-technical people would prefer a bank or similar institution to take care of the security of their bitcoin holdings.
People have this fantasy concept that bitcoin removes the need for banking. It doesn't. Banking in and of itself is a valuable service and a free market will create it.
 What it takes away is the power of governments and other centralised institutions to print money by fiat, which in turn utterly warps the function of banking. It's the government-bank interface which creates all the nasty things we're trying to avoid.
Also of course, people with sufficient confidence in their security abilities will not even need banks at all. That much *is* new (although a hundred years ago I guess there were a fair number of people who were confident of securing their own gold).

Yes, and another vitally important property is that there is no way to use intelligence to speed up the finding process. It has to be genuinely random so that finding a hash lower than the target can only be done by blind guessing.

Things like change addresses are basically a matter of client design choice, or equivalently user choice. The basic structure is: each transaction has a number 1 or more of inputs, each of which is the output of a previous transaction, and a number 1 or more of outputs, and the sum of the inputs has to be less than or equal to the sum of the outputs, the difference being claimed by the block's miner as a fee. In order for the transaction to be valid it has to be signed by all the private keys of the inputs (although more exotic rules like multisignature are possible).
A change address is just the (extremely common) case where the person (note - there is no reference to people in the protocol design) who owns the private keys for the inputs chooses to send some of the value contained in those inputs back to himself, in which case one of the outputs is sent to a pubkey (equivalently, address) owned by that same person. The protocol doesn't want or need to know about the human owners of the inputs and outputs.

That's true (up to nuclear transformations) if you treat the concept of fungibility in the purely theoretical sense, but it requires highly specialised scientific equipment to verify.

In most cases the people taking the other side of the trade to the producer (in this case, a merchant) would be market makers and/or speculators. Basically what's happening here is very similar to what insurance companies do - risk is transferred from someone who just wants to do business (or live their life) to someone who makes it their business to assess that risk. Since it has become their business (whether as a pure market maker or speculator) it's reasonable that they should get some profit from it, whether it be a bid/ask spread or consistently better trading returns through better knowledge or being able to act more quickly on the knowledge.

Fair points. It would not be impossible to build in x% per annum inflation through ongoing mining, arguing that there is some "ideal" rate, or simply set x to offset a predicted rate of loss of coins. I for one have no strong idea about it. I probably would have gone with x=0 too but the tricky part is deciding how to initialize the economy - Satoshi's exponentially decreasing mining rate was apparently modelled on the mining of a natural physical resource. It seems to be working pretty well.

You don't rely on it. Take the case where a person sends the wire, but after a day or two it hasn't arrived. First, the sender of the wire checks that they filled in the form properly etc. If they find the wire was never sent because they didn't do it properly, and they're honest, they redo it or they tell the seller of BTC that the transaction can be reversed. Then 2 signatures will be enough to unlock the BTC in escrow.
In the case where the buyer of BTC is trying to defraud: they say they've sent a wire but they haven't. In this case if they can't show clear documentary evidence to the 3rd party (escrow agent) then the 3rd party will agree to unlock on behalf of the BTC buyer. Cases like that should be very rare.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:02:58
No, it can import private keys from other clients, but the basic concept is this: generally, a private key controls an address. If you lose the private key, you've lost the ability to spend from that address. Electrum puts a twist on that: one seed phrase can be used to generate, deterministically, a whole list of private addresses (unlimited list). So you still have to not lose something: the seed phrase, but that seed phrase will always regenerate the same list of private keys, so there's no need to keep backing up as the list of private keys in your wallet changes.
Brute forcing: short version, you can't brute force if you don't have some kind of clues to reduce the search space. This has been discussed at great length here and in many other places, forgive me if I don't give a full discussion here :)
Hope that helps.

Then why bother importing at all? Just transfer the coins from the old private key to the new electrum wallet over the network.
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:41:53
Basically. People have subtly different ideas in mind when they say "brain wallet".
But here's my recommendation: use Electrum. It will use a random number to create for you a list of 12 words in random order. That word list can be used to generate not just an address, but an entire wallet.
The great advantages of this approach: a list of words is far more memorable than an equivalently secure string of characters, due to mnemonic techniques (associate a story with the words). The high security comes from the about 128 bits of entropy you get with 12 words in random order chosen from a list of 2000-ish. But the best part of all: since Electrum uses a deterministic wallet, this 12 word phrase controls your entire wallet, meaning that if you set your computer on fire and then travel to the other side of the globe, when you finally get round to re-installing Electrum you immediately regain access to the same wallet, with the same 12 word phrase.
The 12 words can be memorised or kept on paper as you wish. Just don't lose them.

There are plenty of scenarios for usage that do not involve mainstream users. First, criminals, especially operating internationally. Then there's remittances of various sorts. This is still very small but a good example that might already be viable is a payment from a parent in China to a child in the US. Then there's simply tech-literate people (like the first ever transaction, the 10kBTC pizza, but also things like paying for hosting services - btc is already better for that kind of thing). Then there's people with a political preference for non-state money (e.g. - free state project). Of course 90%+ of actual transactions are either investment or speculation rather than use - but that is also true in the traditional forex market.

Here's two comments: (1) note how this ends up in a system almost identical to gold-backed banking of the 19th century. good or bad? I don't know.

Not really. If the wallet is encrypted (which you should do), then if you find the wallet again, you get your money back.
And it can be even better, if you use a deterministic wallet client like Electrum or Armory. In that case, if a thief steals your wallet file, and it's properly encrypted, it's useless to them. Meanwhile you can regenerate your wallet and carry on as normal.

Actually, I don't think so. Colored coins can be used to *represent* off-blockchain assets, but they do not allow *backing* with non-blockchain assets. The same is true with similar ideas in Mastercoin et al.
However any attempt to genuinely back/peg e.g. 1 usdcoin = 1 usd is in my opinion fundamentally flawed. Such a guaranteed exchange rate has been tried many times in history, a good example being Britain's attempt to join the European "Exchange Rate Mechanism" in the early 90s, fixing the pound to a certain rate against the DeutschMark. The problem is, unless you have an unlimited supply of both assets, the market will eventually find a way to ignore your peg - see George Soros "the man who broke the Bank of England".
If you have unlimited supply of one of the assets, you can keep its value *below* a limit by continually producing it. See for example the Swiss franc which recently set a maximum for its value against the Euro, successfully.

Spelling aside, that was actually pretty good. In the "moderate" section you didn't mention that the 'trash' computer should not be connected to the internet, though.

With all the talk about the new millennium you could reasonably guess it was 98-01. But I'd like to know too.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:39:41
It increased by 5 times in the period 95-00. Compare with BTC - You could say the early period is kind of irrelevant (nobody had much idea of a good price then), but from the Pizza incident, about 4 years ago, we're talking from 0.0025 to 650.0000 which is an increase of 260,000 times.
Some of those numbers may be a bit off but the general point is obvious. No comparison.

Some of us are not lazy at all, but do not have 8GB RAM lying around.
When the devs have released a version using less than 1GB (which I know they are trying to do), I will try again.
What constantly annoys me is people recommending bitcoin-qt to newbies and failing to mention that it takes days to sync, or recommending Armory without mentioning the astonishing RAM requirements (and bitcoinqt dependency!)

It's not really like that. Read the article called something like "the history of egold" available online. The guy running it not only did his best to follow the law, but was actively telling law enforcement about the accounts that he saw suspicious activity on, even though it went against his own confidentiality policy. They ignored him, then used his info. to prosecute HIM!

I doubt it. You probably mean exante, which is in Malta.

If anything, I don't think it frightens Joe Average as much as it should. If they don't understand computers, and they don't understand Bitcoin, they should probably stay out for now. I think we agree on the situation. But "when the day comes" - yes, that day probably will come, which is why I don't agree with your title, which sort of presupposes that day won't come.

Yeah, if they've got any sense, they'll take a loooong time to get their case together :)

The general pattern of reports that I've read is - they tell the bank what they want to do, the bank has no constructive response (don't understand what they're talking about, don't know what bitcoin is), then some time later they get their accounts frozen with no warning - which means someone higher up or in a different department, who never deal with customers directly, have decided to flag the account. This is how banks work because they are not incentivised to actually serve their "customers" - they are incentivised to follow the dictates of political and economic power base (you know, the people who arrange bail outs when necessary). You cannot disentangle the politics from the economics here.

Less insecure than a wallet full of paper cash. Less fees and fraud risk than a credit card (advantages for merchant, but they can pass them on to you).
It's a sweet spot - as long as the merchant can accept 0 confirmations, which should be fine for sandwiches.

This is not a new phenomenon - just look at what goes on in penny stocks (pink sheets, OTC). It's sad for uninformed people who lose money, but to be fair they have to be both stupid *and* greedy to lose significant sums this way.
On the other hand if someone really believed in, say, Peercoin, they wouldn't be scared out by pump and dump machinations.
Have at it, I say. This is a free market. If you don't want to be free go back to your "money managers" and mutual funds or whatever crap the establishment is peddling nowadays (for exorbitant fees, of course).

Don't worry. It's using a pseudo random number generator (sometimes called PRNG) like this: 
    random_seed = lambda n: "%032x"%ecdsa.util.randrange( pow(2,n) )
and then converting that into a string of words. This is safe from any reasonable attack, as long as (a) the PRNG operates properly and (b) there is no attacker observing you while you do it.
To get a really safe wallet seed, run electrum on a computer or OS instance that has never connected to the internet, and is not connected to a hard drive that has ever connected to the internet. This might be overkill if the amount of money is fairly small, but make your own call on that.

Mining does not fall under the MSB description - it's not moving people's money around, and it's not changing one currency to another. It's creating or finding currency which was not previously in circulation.
It may well be made illegal in the near future anyway, based on different trumped up charges. But it will be very difficult to stop.

I'm in for 3 months.
Been using reddit for 5 years, so I don't feel bad about buying a few bitcents worth :)
Buying was smooth enough - it gives an error message initially, maybe it should take account of the inevitable conf. delay. Newbies might find the error message a bit scary.
I think this is an excellent idea!

Good point. I agree in the case of a paper wallet, go the whole hog. 128 bits is good enough for me, though, and the method of construction is such that I *can* remember it, pretty easily actually.

Under 1 minute confirmations is basically insane. Given that the number is a *mean*, the standard deviation will imply that you'll regularly get blocks discovered every few seconds. That combined with network latency means that even during normal operation, the amount of block orphaning will be huge.

Thanks, excellent. And I found  too :) That really seems like it should work...

Problem solved simply and elegantly in Electrum:
12 words are chosen *at random* by the software, from a list of about 2000 (or so).
Gives 120ish bits of entropy - uncrackable.
The trick is: it's easy to remember the list of words using standard memory techniques.
