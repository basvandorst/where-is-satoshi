Because after all the publicity in the last few months the big players want to scare away the newbies that bough in then, and get a chance to buy more at a low-ish price.

If someone wants to set this up with the pizzas going to charity, I would definitely donate a bit.

Two things: 
First is network effects. For a payment system to be useful it has to be widely adopted. Admitted, any establishment accepting Bitcoin is fairly likely to accept a few other types of coins, but Bitcoin is the oldest and largest. This is also doubled by the fact that a networks security depends also on the size of the network, meaning that regardless of advances in technology,  Bitcoin has a security advantage that cannot be easily replicated.
Secondly is that as many coins are open source projects, any game changing advantage that one coin might introduce can quickly be adopted by other coins. Any coin that isn't open source OTOH leaves some potential for backdoors and requires some level of trust that simply isn't needed for most coins. The result of this is that better software does not necessarily lead to any advantage long term. That said some changes would be very difficult to pitch to the majority of miners and are thus unlikely to be introduced but are theoretically possible.

Well, by definition that can only happen once, so....

Their terms of service are unclear, but it appears to me that they treat your holdings as USD and will return Bitcoin at the current exchange rate with USD. This means that their interest comes at the cost of no longer having any exposure to Bitcoin.
