I think you can get a pretty good rate by putting your own ad up on [LocalBitcoins]( with a competitive price.
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:56:00
There doesn't seem to be much dilemma, I would buy the bitcoins.  Although BTC price could go way down before it goes back up to where it was a couple years ago, so a smart thing to do with the $1,600 may be to split it into eight or sixteen equal amounts and buy every couple of weeks or so regardless of price.  [Coinbase]( I believe, allows you to do this automatically with scheduled buys.
Edit: On second thought I take that back, you could buy the ASIC miner and play around with it and learn a lot.  You did say that the spare money was "to play with."  And whereas nobody has any more than five years of experience with bitcoin, the miner could turn out to be the better investment, insofar as you'd be making an investment in yourself, your own knowledge and abilities.  Because your expertise would be in a field that will grow hugely, it may well be worth more than the appreciation on 4–5 BTC several years from now.

It can fluctuate quite a bit, so I've done the same calculation you did at other times during the past six months, (1+0.85r)ˆ365.25, and gotten 2–3%.  If I'm not mistaken your principal and interest can be set up on Bitfinex to be reinvested each time your loan comes due.  But if supply and demand change such that in a couple weeks, the going rate isn't 0.027%/day but 0.009%/day, either your money is re-loaned at that lower "flash rate" or else you keep it at 0.027% and nobody takes it until supply dwindles again.
Even as I look at [BFXdata]( now the USD rate is 0.03000%/day, so it jumps around a lot, it's not like a bank's CD rates that only get changed each quarter.
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:28:20
If you did it through LocalBitcoins and marked the transaction as paid in time then yes, you would receive your bitcoins after LocalBitcoins support releases them.

I'll give it a shot.  The way he explained it to me, you could go to your bank and ask for $9,000 in hundreds before you go to the airport, so your account is $9,000 lighter.  You get a 2% discount buying bitcoins once you hit Argentina and this is like your compensation for bringing dollars into a place where they're hard to come by.  Then you sell (ASAP to avoid volatility risk) on a US or EU local market, ideally getting the money deposited in cash into your same bank account that same day.    
And since sellers in these places have to send to an exchange, and this involves wire fees, waiting, and exchange fees, they charge at least a few percentage points above market when they turn around and sell, pBuyers are happy to pay this because they don't want to deal with that stuff or don't know how.  But you don't really have any of these costs when you buy in person with cash.    
For the number crunching part, say you do take $9,000 out the day of travel and buy at a 2% discount and let's just say your bank is in [Baton Rouge]( (but I guess lots of other places work the same way) and we see that BTC is sold for at least 7% over market via cash deposit, maybe you can get somebody to deposit at 8% over into your bank that day because it would still be one of the best offers, then you have 9000(1.08/0.98) or $9,920, maybe $9,820 if you have to pay a 1% fee on the website, but you'd still have at least $820 more than you did the morning of your departure.    
Well, you also took an international flight, so maybe it's not a good business plan although it would at least pay for your flight now that oil is low, and your Cinnabon too.

If you're there for more than just a weekend or so you have a couple options, one would be to [post your own ad]( thereby naming your own price if you don't like the ones available.  You could also go to one of the meetup groups (looks like there are three), those are great for making contacts.  And I don't think there's a Facebook group specifically for BTC (I could be wrong) but a digital nomad or expatriate group would certainly include BTC buyers and sellers.
@_date: 2015-12-04 06:33:18
Probably best to worst would be buying instantly w/ bank acct. or debit/credit card through [Circle]( then some other method on [LocalBitcoins]( and lastly enabling instant buy on [Coinbase]( with a credit card and bank account.
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:11:48


   
A buddy of mine definitely is, he's been down there for two years I think, and takes hundred dollar bills every time he's flying into Argentina.    
You would get a 13.70 ARSUSD rate at the moment, perhaps slightly more if you were changing larger quantities with *mayoristas*.  The reference for the black market rate is [Ámbito.com]( where it says "informal."  You can also, from what I understand, just buy with USD and skip the money exchange.  So you'll see that multiple traders are selling at 1% below market rate or so for cash [locally](  Since there's a 1% escrow built into these prices, and you won't actually be using escrow once you're seated across the table from the person in a café (since there's no need to), you'll probably be able to get an additional 1% off, which is to say you can easily buy bitcoins for 1–2% below market rate in Argentina and more if you do a little bit of work and [post an ad yourself](
@_date: 2015-12-22 13:15:50
For those who don't know yet (and god forbid, keep using tradition remittance processors) [bitcoins are cheap in Argentina]( because of these same currency controls.  In most cases the remittance recipient will get more than the sender paid in Argentina, and this is **only** possible thanks to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:10:42
Another recourse could be going on the [forum]( and asking if anybody has additional contact information for him.  This may work if he is a well-known trader.  I may be hesitant to accuse him of wrongdoing unless you are fairly sure.  Sometimes the public aspect of the forum may push people to do the right thing when they otherwise wouldn't have.
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:51:45
I know there's a somewhat active p2p bitcoin scene in [Chiang Mai](
@_date: 2015-12-05 23:34:45
I think that in the US and Europe you'd need to be eighteen so as to comply with their terms of service.  So [LocalBitcoins]( may be the best option, just pick a method that says "instant" in the description.  Coins bought there don't even need to await confirmation in the blockchain, you get them transferred internally into your wallet and can spend or send them anywhere.  What sucks is that you'll almost certainly be paying a markup, particularly if you're a new user.  I don't know if any of the other services actually check if you're eighteen.
@_date: 2015-12-05 22:06:30
Yeah, I think it will be the same story with Circle.  FWIW I think the ID verification with Uphold just took me a few minutes, it's not done by a person it's just their system.
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:31:21
Yes I absolutely agree with it is more of a dollar issue than a bitcoin one, sorry if the thing I said was confusing.  If we were on somebody might be saying that you can get great prices on rare South American wines in Argentina by bringing USD into the country.  It's a bit easier to move and sell bitcoin at a profit, taking advantage of the economic situation that way.
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:47:38
If you have an open trade with him on the site, then mark it as paid if you haven't already.  This guarantees that your bitcoins will be held in escrow.  You can, if he doesn't respond, initiate a dispute on the same page.  Just upload the evidence that you've paid and your bitcoins should eventually be released to you.
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:29:26
In that case I would contact Amazon now and see what can be done.  Because they won't cancel/recall something that has already been shipped, so after Monday morning it would be too late.
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:40:11
A pretty simple yet fun game that's provably fair is the [Bitkong]( app, which was made by the guys who did the [Coyn]( wallet.  I think it has a faucet that gives you 60 bits/hour and 100 when you sign in with Facebook.  I'm afraid I don't know too much about sports sites.
@_date: 2015-12-06 20:55:15
Personally I think that the top methods, from best to worst, would be buying instantly w/ bank acct. or debit/credit card through [Circle]( then through the method of your choosing on [LocalBitcoins]( and lastly enabling instant buy on [Coinbase]( with a credit card and bank account.
Edit: All of these sites come with free wallets for you to store and send bitcoin from.  Just paste the sending address for whatever you want to buy into them and send the appropriate amount.  They're all fairly easy to use.
@_date: 2015-12-04 15:00:04
That's a really cool idea!  I know that Expatistan has some good crowdsourced data on those sorts of baskets of goods across the world.  So maybe pulling some data from both [Expatistan South Africa]( and [LocalBitcoins South Africa]( e.g., one could get an idea of what it's like to live there on BTC.  Expatistan also includes parallel street exchange rates, where applicable, like in Argentina and Venezuela, and LocalBitcoins cash trades all take this into account too.
@_date: 2015-12-04 06:21:57
Oftentimes if you post an ad yourself on [**LocalBitcoins India**]( at your desired rate and payment method, and you are attentive to your inbox, then you'll be able to sell quickly.  You can choose to meet the buyer in person, have her deposit cash at your bank, transfer, etc.
@_date: 2015-12-05 01:23:22
Looks like you're almost there with tips alone!  I don't know where you are located, but it looks like at least three people sell from 1€ on [LocalBitcoins Europe]( two in Italy and one in France (tell them you're doing a project on bitcoin for school); I also tried on [Circle]( which I know works with some European debit cards and it lets me buy as little as $1; and [Coinbase]( would work in almost all of Europe but the fee would be too high on 1€ with them.  It would also take too long.
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:20:43
Sure, it's tough to know what exactly happened, with the timing as well.  If, after the trader's name it says "(70+; 100%)" or some number greater than seventy, you're probably smart to give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he just went to bed and is just being cautious himself in dealing with a new person.
@_date: 2015-12-05 15:50:24
The bitcoin wiki has a pretty exhuastive [list of places]( where you can spend yout bitcoins online.
You can also buy stuff right off Amazon at pretty good discounts using [Purse](  I typically get 20–25% off and free 2-day shipping.
@_date: 2015-12-23 23:17:49

Also great to see all the programmers' pet projects, BTC gaming apps, accounting/savings programs, and generally fun ideas.
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:37:16
[explained it really well]( it's like the dollar is a little more powerful because it's sort of been criminalized and that's why you're able to buy BTC and other stuff below market with dollars (or pesos, at the black market rate).
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:37:18
Sounds good.  The method you chose wasn't a bad one, lots of people get BTCs quickly, as attested.  Just use the [platform](  You are quite well protected as soon as you've opened a trade and marked it complete.  In fact, you're probably at less risk than the seller.  As soon as you mark payment complete, the transaction has 1/3 signatures, the second one gives you your bitcoins and comes either from the seller or the LocalBitcoins support team in the case of dispute of the transaction.
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:09:50
Well for online trades you just transfer or deposit into a bank account; for cash trades yes, you do risk getting severely beaten, although you may also get some bitcoins, so some would say that it's worth it.
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:48:38
Yes, good point.  I guess I couldn't say whether the government be for or against it.  And bitcoin activity is probably just a drop in the bucket in terms of the dollars they need to repay their [bondholders]( and Repsol for the [renationalization of YPF](
@_date: 2015-12-05 23:45:21
I know that [LocalBitcoins India]( has a lot of offers, you would probably just have to use a bank transfer or cash deposit instead of buying with the card.  And [Uphold]( may be worth a shot, they let me buy instantly with Visa or MasterCard, though just 600 USD a week.
Edit: Yes, I tried Uphold and it is very bad, I would not recommend it due to the reasons gave and also their "instant" feature for which they charge 2.95% "may take up to 48 hours" during Uphold's "delays," as I have now been told via message from their support.  I apologize, I just figured this out!
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:01:54
Was the whole trade done outside of the LocalBitcoins platform?  They do provide some [security]( features.  If, however, you did it outside of the site then do you at least remember his username and does he have any sort of history/reputation?  You may be able to open up a new trade with him and then cancel it immediately—through this canceled trade you will have the equivalent of a PM system in order to communicate with him.
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:51:14
My experience has been godawful.  They let you buy BTC with a card for 2.93% (avg. over a few purchases I tried to make) over what you'd pay on Bitfinex.  So in certain instances that would make sense for me, e.g. I only want a little bit, I'm saving much more by buying with BTC, etc.  **Their major problem is that they overpromise and underdeliver.**  I made a purchase for example that has been saying "This transaction may take a few seconds to complete" now for twenty-four hours.  Support takes hours to respond (there's no chat feature) saying "We are experiencing . . . delays . . . it may take up to 48 hours for your transaction to post to your Uphold account."  And of course, that there's nothing they can do.  So I'm fine paying a little bit more for instant, but this is even worse than LocalBitcoins.
Anyway, that's just my bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-26 02:45:36
Yes, use the sell online option on [LocalBitcoins]( in the US and somebody will drive or walk to your supplier's bank tomorrow or Monday and deposit into the acct. you specify and send proof.  You'll be able to get the same price as an exchange, just make sure and use a buyer with good reputation who is online.
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:07:53
Yes, it's a common [method on LocalBitcoins]( and I think that if this person's intent was to defraud you then this would be one of the worst ways to do it.  If you cannot contact him via text, call, or through the page, and you feel that you were robbed then report the cards stolen to Amazon and explain the situation.  I know that they deal with this and other kinds of fraud pretty competently, and if items were ordered in the US then there's time for them to return you the funds and cancel those items since they won't have shipped yet.
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:55:33
I think he's talking about "error coins" that had the wrong year stamped on them, i.e. 2008, before bitcoin existed.  These can be sold to collectors and dealers for much higher than face value.  If, of course, he remembers that darn password.
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:38:24
You would declare the $820 in the example above as income, it's like if your paycheck got deposited, except instead of an $820 credit you have a $9,000 debit followed by a $9,820 credit.    
I can't imagine you'd have any real tax liability in Argentina, you're just buying stuff as a tourist, but instead of a T-shirt or a case of wine it's bitcoin.  If anything, their government wants tourists coming in with dollars.
@_date: 2015-12-05 20:08:32
Yes, as far as I know you're right about Coinbase, you can't buy without having that bank info.  However, at least two services, [Circle]( and [Uphold]( will let you buy with a debit card only, and I think they're a bit better than Coinbase anyway because your bitcoins would arrive instantly and then you can get cash for them in [Kathmandu if you want, through LocalBitcoins](
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:45:16
If Coinbase is available to you then [Circle]( probably is too, they would allow you to buy instantly with a debit or credit card although I'm not sure what the initial limit would be.  [Uphold]( would be another option and they would let you buy up to $600/week [it looks like]( instantly and with a card.
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:00:11
I usually sell my BTC salary for cash deposits at my bank through [LocalBitcoins]( because I get about 9% more than I would through Coinbase and it's done on the same day.  That being said, depending on your volumes and where you're located, you may need to get a license if you do this on a larger scale, for me it's just a portion of my salary each month.
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:27:05
If somebody doesn't respond to yours by noon or whenever then respond to somebody else's.  You need not send any bitcoins till somebody initiates a trade with you, so I think it may be worth a shot.  And if you have the most attractive offer in HK then you'll know as soon as the next person browsing the marketplace needs BTC.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:32:21
Depends where you are, you can usually get a good premium on [LocalBitcoins]( for cash or somebody depositing cash into your bank account.  If you prefer wire transfers then probably [Bitfinex](

I know I've seen similar offerings on the [BitPremier real estate page](    
As far as I know you can either take cash or the BTC from sales done through BitPremier.  On the other hand I've seen some of the same ads stay on for months and months, so maybe they're not very good at selling things.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:50:09
I think the instant aspect and convenience are selling points.  Online exchanges aren't as cheap as they look either.  Besides fees on each trade, there are wire fees from your bank, the intermediary bank (sometimes), and the exchange's bank, plus sometimes a deposit fee.  If you just need 200 USD or something then walking to a BATM makes sense, even it it charges a 6% fee.
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:46:04

Yeah, when you buy bitcoin through any of [247exchange]( [Circle]( [Coinbase]( [LocalBitcoins]( [Mycelium for Android]( or [Uphold]( it'll be available and you can immediately send it and not have to send to your own wallet first.  LBC and Mycelium would be the anonymous and instant options.
@_date: 2016-01-31 21:39:55
A bunch of the most active traders on the [LBC forum]( charge ridiculous margins and have 3,000+ trades done, so they must be doing something right.
@_date: 2016-01-30 14:30:36
I don't know the ID requirements but [247exchange]( [Circle]( [Purse]( and [Bittylicious]( accept prepaid Visa.  Actually Circle I'm not 100% sure about, they may have discontinued that.
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:04:43
Yeah, I think that if the person has good reputation and you've read up on a [security guide]( or two then it's like buying anything else.  If the person wants to send to you directly and not use any kind of platform, that could be a red flag.  In any event, wait for at least one confirmation.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:02:04
Uphold is not merely awful, I would consider it sacrilegious to call it anything less than godawful.    
[Circle]( and [Coinbase]( are similar options that work better, a majority of [LocalBitcoins]( sellers allow for anonymous and instant buying through a variety of methods (look for "instant release" in the descriptions), not just meeting some guy at a Starbucks, and [Mycelium for Android]( is also fast and anonymous, though you have to physically meet with your counterparty to complete the exchange.
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:54:40
I always thought it was cool that LocalBitcoins [began from the assumption that the buyer may not have her own device]( and developed the code word method.  Even cell coverage for SMS isn't a given in some parts of the world.

It's all pretty clearly laid out in their [buying guide]( gift cards and PayPal tend to get worse rates than cash-in-hand or cash deposits at a bank.

Venezuela is an interesting case because people use the banking system much more than other countries in the region (which is good because otherwise they'd be using wheelbarrows), and at the same time [BTC use is growing]( especially in the remittance space.    
Bank transfers that, on paper, look like millions of dollars when in reality they're less than 10,000 USD may cause problems in terms of taxes, so Venezuela could be a good place for full BTC adoption and use.

Yeah, great parallel!  Email is also a good analogy because in the early days people didn't really understand it and nobody knew where to type what, or what Re:,  and CC meant.  And now everybody's grandmother can use email, for two reasons.  1) things like Gmail and BlackBerry built systems on top of email that made it easy and more useful and 2) people made the effort to learn it once they realized how truly new and valuable it was.    
I remember in the early days of email, few people used it, fewer "got it," but those few were great evangelists and clearly saw the path to mass adoption.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:09:20
It's hard to know if you can trust Coinbase with your bank login and password, I'd say probably not.  And they do thoroughly track what their users do with any bitcoins bought from them or that pass through their wallet, so yes, even if you sent to a different wallet they'd be traceable to you.
@_date: 2016-01-20 08:29:44
Yes, the MSB license is needed in the US I believe.  That being said, some people have gotten it and most bitcoin trading or p2p websites will allow you to export all trade data which makes filing taxes easier.    
I don't know what OP meant by BTC that can be obtained for "a price that is worth my time" but if we said that that meant 0.94(Bitfinex), for example, and he was able to sell for 1.06(Bitfinex) (easily accomplished on [LocalBitcoins](
)) for $5k Mon.–Fri. (a volume that can be scaled to pretty quickly) then that's roughly $148k profit per year, and certainly justifies the lawyer, MSB license, and CPA if all three are even needed.  Research could fill in for the lawyer and software for the CPA.

Is it for a business payment?  I would specify in the contract that the Indian payer must pay the full amount in BTC at Bitfinex rate or at Bitfinex*USDINR.  The payee would immediately be able to sell in the US, 50,000 USD will be bought quickly and you could probably do it all above market rate.

Honestly so many sites have hidden fees or just don't do what they say they will in terms of processing time or whatever that the only way to get a good deal fast is [putting your own ad up on LBC]( or [Mycelium for Android](  You control the payment method, who you offer to (i.e. only people with lots of volume and 100% reputation), and exactly what price you want with their [price equations](  And the drawback is the learning curve, but once you've mastered the platforms as well as your particular market BTC will become your favorite currency.

That was a great reply by Antonopoulous.  I think all startup people like to think of themselves as innovators and visionaries solving important problems when the truth is that the biggest issues in the third world are problems they just cannot improve in any measurable amount.

Sell on [LocalBitcoins]( and somebody will take the cash to your bank today before it closes.  Set the rate at bitfinexusd*1.01 and you'll get market rate and have the 1% comission paid for.  Maybe make the ad visible only to people with lots of trades and 100% reputation so you won't have problems with novices or bad actors.

I haven't heard of the two companies sharing a client database.  Maybe if OP doesn't repeat the same ToS violation with Coinbase that he committed with Circle then he'll be able to use an acct. with Coinbase.

@_date: 2016-01-19 17:19:08
Well if you decide to sell just do it for bank deposit through [LocalBitcoins](
) because you'll get about 8% more and have the money as soon as the buyer deposits cash into your acct.  Or if you want to sell face-to-face you can use that or [Mycelium]( on Android.  Coinbase will cause you to lose another 1% at least and wait 3–7 days or more to get your money.

Any startup's letter to their shareholders is going to make them sound exceptional, transparent, and visionary.  And then if you look at all of the impressive startups they've partnered with and all of the innovative things they've promised to their clients and the phenomenal results they show to their shareholders, it all looks like we're living in the future and everything is just fine.    
If we take it back down to earth, I have in fact used Uphold.  The first time, after I'd become a verified member, I used my card to buy bitcoins instantly and paid a little extra for this, 2.75%.  The page said that "This transaction may take **a few seconds** to complete" (emphasis mine) and **48 hours later** I had my bitcoins.  So discrepancy between promise and delivery is **four orders of magnitude**.  I got a message from support saying "I'm so sorry - this isn't our usual way of operating, for sure."    
Well if this surely isn't their way of operating then why not try again?  So I did, this time with a bank transfer.  I'd linked it to my Uphold account and was set to have my bitcoins in "**3–5 business days**," as per the page.  So six business days later I find myself writing Uphold support again.  After a lot of back-and-forth with their Lead Support Engineer, I learn that it I will more realistically receive my purchase in "6–8 business days" or perhaps more if they have "any problem with [their] payment processing gateway" and that they "are working to improve this feature and hopefully you will be able to do the same operation faster in the near future."  Now it is **8 business days** later and I continue to wait.  So the discrepancy between promise and delivery has been reduced to a **&gt;60% difference**, not quite four orders of magnitude.  I don't know where they pull these estimates out of but they have no concern for staying within the promises they give to their clients.    
Unfortunately, this happens all the time with all sorts of startups.  It's hard to find one that always does what they say they will do and in the rare cases that they fail, will work hard to fix it.  If Uphold simply did what they said they would, then they would be unique and useful.  But making bold, colorful claims and then falling short is not unique, most companies are doing that, all over the world.  That's why, to separate the wheat from the chaff, it's good to look at what companies can actually do, because there isn't much limit to what they can say they will do, especially when they can earn a few bucks doing so.    
When a person or business can do what they promise, every single time, even if they aren't promising to be better than everybody else, then I will take notice.
@_date: 2016-01-14 11:09:01
I think being able to send six bucks instantly and with a 6% fee is awesome.  It also seems like as your technical knowledge and willingness to investigate/work increases, you could decrease your fee even further.  Say you were putting your own ad up on [LocalBitcoins Philippines]( if I calculated correctly, paying both the 1% BTC purchase fee and 1% LocalBitcoins fee you'd be exchanging at exact spot rate for PHP plus making $5–6/BTC.
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:33:47
It depends, what are you putting the money into?
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:09:59
It was probably the advertised rate if you did a trade within escrow on [LocalBitcoins]( to their guide in case you didn't read it the first time around.  People get confused with gift cards because they'll have "$15" printed on them, so they assume it's worth 15.00 USD.  In reality, as soon as you buy a gift card you've lost money, it's like driving your new car off the lot.
@_date: 2016-01-11 16:49:04
This is a good strategy, investing the same € amount each month.  Do you have the investment automated?  I know [Coinbase]( lets you do this, just send €(x) of each paycheck to be converted to BTC.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:03:18
Unless the seller specifically requires ID you don't need any on [LocalBitcoins](
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:03:12
Keep in mind that Coinapult charges 0–2% in fees, and these tend to be larger as the amount of bitcoin goes up.  [Bitfinex]( may be cheaper, or at least their fees are more clearly stated.
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:04:53
You're being charged fees, so you'll get a bit less than market rate (about $4/BTC) on both the buy and the sell.  I'm pretty sure of this because a) you didn't account for this in your math and b) even if you were buying a full BTC, during no 1m interval today did the BTCUSD move $4 or more.    
All exchanges give you a slightly worse-than-advertised price, except if you do your own offers on [LocalBitcoins]( or [Mycelium for Android](  Mycelium lets you set percentages above and below market rate and LocalBitcoins has quite robust [pricing equations](  Just remember that Mycelium has no fees but you have to meet the counterparty face-to-face, and LocalBitcoins charges 1% for online trades so just price it in and make your counterparty bear that cost.
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:51:51
I've seen offers for Skrill on [LocalBitcoins](

I don't know about the legal aspect, though I wish more services would scramble as the default.  I read, e.g., [that LocalBitcoins]( has a wallet with bitcoins from many accounts mixed together so your BTCs come out already tumbled.
@_date: 2016-01-04 12:02:53
One thing you can do if you have a little bit of free time, basically to respond to the occasional email, is buy bitcoins off [Circle]( or [Coinbase]( or wherever and sell them on the [local market](  Particularly if there aren't a lot of traders right around you there can be good volume and margin in this, and just charge enough that volatility doesn't really affect you.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:04:37
Bitcoins are huge in Argentina, or if you look at [Buenos Aires]( at least.  It could be a good candidate for day-to-day BTC use because of the currency problems they have, talking in the most basic sense.  Like it's hard to get coins and their highest bill is the hundred peso note, even though it's worth less than 8 USD.
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:14:14
Yes, you must pay tax on all income.  If you suddenly become wealthier because you stole a car stereo, then you had still better declare it to the government and pay tax on it, otherwise you're committing two crimes.

A great position to be in is to be able to say that you've made so much money from it that you'll still be ahead even if bitcoin goes to zero.  A couple of alternative investments that come to mind would be, first, your own knowledge and abilities in bitcoin and blockchain.  Education has been a pretty solid investment for the last couple thousand years and in a decade or so having "fifteen years bitcoin and blockchain experience" on your résumé may mean a salary bump or perhaps even the difference between getting the job and getting passed over.  If bitcoin is trading under $1 or at zero at that time you'll still be ahead, blockchain will still be important.  This would require continual reading and study on your part, both in fundamentals and new developments.  Not impossible to do by keeping up-to-date through Reddit articles, e-books, and MOOCs.    
The other income stream I've seen doesn't scream "*scam*" is trading through something like [LocalBitcoins]( or [Mycelium for Android](  You don't have the volumes of [Bitfinex]( although that means you don't have the competition either.  Say you're trading in some smaller city like Raleigh, NC or wherever, you will probably be the only one or have very little competition in the local market.  Still, Raleigh and it's metropolitan area have an economy that's bigger than many countries and if you can make, say, 8% margins on the full buy+sell loop trading in your free time then after a dozen or so trades, you will have made your entire initial investment in dollars, so now BTC can go to zero and you'll still be ahead.
@_date: 2016-01-12 03:42:27
[Gemini]( [LocalBitcoins]( etc. are good suggestions, although you're totally right that whatever premium you could get from liquidating your bitcoins is overshadowed by the tax liability.  So I would do the same thing you do when your dog is sick or your car doesn't start and **call a professional!**  Bitcoins accountants are out there and the right one will pay for him or herself when they save you from forking 40% over to the government.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:10:02
I won't say no, but I will say it's not allowed.  Coinbase will close your account because they like to comply with government regulations that inhibit bitcoin p2p markets.  But take a look at [LocalBitcoins](
) and you realize it's not really suffering because of this.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:16:11
1% per day is an incredibly high return.  The S&amp;P 500 has, throughout history, outperformed bonds, real estate, and gold and returns about 0.04% per trading day, less if you measure by calendar day.    
A safe lending platform for your BTC may be [Bitfinex's]( swaps, which you can set to automatically renew, thus compunding your interest.  You can check current rates on [BFXData]( keep in mind that Bitfinex takes 15% of your daily return in fees.    
If you're unhappy with 0.05% (or less) in daily returns, you must assume more risk.  That could be p2p lending, trading on [LocalBitcoins]( or investing directly into some sort of bitcoin project.  Although none of these would qualify as "safe" investments.
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:31:47
[Circle]( [Coinbase]( [LocalBitcoins]( [Mycelium for Android]( or [Uphold]( will all work for &lt;$20 in BTC.  All but Coinbase and Uphold will process the transaction instantly, and Coinbase has an instant option if you link a credit card as well as your bank acct.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:50:53
Circle and Coinbase will give you market rate minus about one percent 3–5 business days after you execute the trade.  LocalBitcoins will give you at least four percent over market rate and the buyer will either hand you cash or deposit cash into your account.  Don't screw with PayPal or gift cards, just take cash.
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:25:47
Yeah, because instead of risking a lump sum on bitcoin going up, you're investing over time.  Say you do €500 on the first day of every month no matter what.  Then when it's €250/BTC you're buying 2, when it goes up to €500 you're buying 1 (less since it's more expensive), when it goes down to €100 you've bought 5 (taking advantage of cheap BTC), and your average price per BTC would be €187,50 instead of €250 had you bought everything at once.  Plus it's easy to set up and a strategy that you can stick with and don't have to think about.    
You know exactly how much will be deducted from your account each month and it automatically buys however many BTCs that is.    
And theoretically in the above example, whatever bitcoin eventually goes up to, you've multiplied your gains by 4/3 by investing this way.
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:37:02
Perhaps [Coinbase]( or [Uphold]( would be good options for you if you haven't already tried them.

Honestly, you're probably better off keeping your money in a bank or investing it in your own business/the stock market.  Your bank and [Coinbase]( etc. will shut down your accounts if they think you're trying to make money and/or cut into their oligopoly.

) offering to buy BTC at a convenient price with the cash, from there the BTC can be sent and turned back into cash pretty much anywhere on the planet.  Make sure your [price equation]( includes the 1% fee so that they don't have to pay it themselves.
@_date: 2016-01-08 01:15:19
Bitcoin Core might be more than you need to make a simple purchase or hold bitcoin.  Typically the service you're buying from, be it [Circle]( [Coinbase]( [LocalBitcoins]( or [Uphold]( will come with a free wallet that you can use.  And wallets use addresses, not names, which start with a "1" or sometimes a "3" and are a long series of numbers and letters.
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:52:26

@_date: 2016-01-22 19:17:54

Yeah, put your [own ad up on LocalBitcoins Costa Rica]( and you'll probably make money on the exchange.  Send to an exchange or mixer after buying on Coinbase, as they can get pissy if they think you're trying to abuse their ToS, although in this case you're just sending yourself money.
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:57:25
You can [put up your own ad]( and for the price equation just use bitfinexusd*0.99 so that after the 1% commission you're still buying at exactly market price.  No ID necessary and you can pick the means of payment you want.  You have to wait for somebody to sell to you and after that you get your bitcoins as soon as you've paid and your counterparty confirms.    
And in fact this is better than buying from [Bitfinex]( where you would have to pay for a wire, wait, and then pay a 0.1–0.2% fee.
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:34:27
With the ["sell bitcoins for cash"]( option or else on [Mycelium for Android]( although it may not have as many offers.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:44:37
All true, and if you look at [the listings on LocalBitcoins]( you'll see the same BTC ends up costing you more than it would through Coinbase, some call this the premium you pay for privacy.  Transactions within LocalBitcoins do not show up on the blockchain (although that's not to say a permanent ledger of them does not exist).
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:45:45
Different options, [247exchange]( [Circle]( [Coinbase]( [LocalBitcoins]( [Mycelium for Android]( [Purse]( or [Uphold]( will all work.  LBC and Mycelium will be the fastest and most anonymous but likely not the cheapest.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:48:12
This sounds awesome, I hope it doesn't get bogged down by local laws.
@_date: 2016-01-25 00:08:58
That approach is very reasonable—investing a little bit each week or month no matter what the price.  I think that [Coinbase]( allows for automated purchases that way.    
Also don't forget alternative and indirect methods of investing in bitcoin.  For example, if you download a couple e-books about bitcoin, consistently read up on new developments, and stay in the loop, in a few years having "5 years experience in bitcoin and blockchain technology" on your résumé will be worth a salary bump or may even make the difference between getting the job and getting passed over.  Or some people are able to trade bitcoin in their spare time through p2p platforms like [LocalBitcoins](
) or [Mycelium for Android]( and make, say, 8% profit margin on a complete buy and sell loop, net of fees.  So after doing that once a week for a year on $500 worth of bitcoin, you'd have made $2,080 and if the $500 in BTC goes to $0 or to $1,000 you've still made a nice profit in dollars.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:21:21
Yes, it's really easy with the app because you just take a picture of your debit/credit card.  I'm not sure if they do instant anymore.
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:39:55
Sure!  It's just about getting your average cost per BTC down as low as possible.  Since it's unlikely that right now is the best time to buy BTC (that would imply it will only go up), but you also need to buy at some point if you want to invest and not miss out on bitcoin's eventual rise, then this is an intermediate strategy that, although imperfect, is useful.
@_date: 2016-01-31 03:50:29
[Here you go]( it's a 0–15% fee that correlates with size of the discount you receive.
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:48:13
I think that on LocalBitcoins and Paxful most people end up dealing directly with the traders on there, so they'll send wherever you want and probably cut you a deal, as many of them mine or get paid in BTC and need to convert it into something that's more useful to them.
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:06:16
Purse is great, although the discounts everybody's always raving about sort of imply OP will get a so-so price for his BTC.  Comparison shopping on [LocalBitcoins](
) too might be useful, since you can set your own prices and not have to accept somebody else's.
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:38:40
Of course, you just sell them back to [Circle]( or if the price is better at [Coinbase]( [LocalBitcoins](
), or [Uphold]( then "return" them there.
@_date: 2016-01-31 01:11:04
Definitely, just be sure and do some research on each service.  [Circle]( [Coinbase]( and [LocalBitcoins]( I've used and can vouch for.
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:56:48
Venezuelan families that have somebody remitting money from abroad are benefitting from bitcoin, you can see that [from the p2p markets in Caracas](
).  But beyond that it's an exaggeration to say that bitcoin is rescuing the economy.  People aren't, as far as I know, using it as a store of value, they prefer USD for that if they can get their hands on any.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:10:14
PayPal is reversible and has less uses for most people than cash in hand or in a bank account.  So you can still buy BTC with PayPal, just realize that $100 on PayPal is only going to be worth $90 tops when going to BTC.

Congratulations!    
I haven't bought from a BATM before, what is the normal delay time between putting the money in and being able to spend my bitcoins?    
And what is the maximum delay?
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:34:51
[User agreement]( for anyone interested.
@_date: 2016-01-14 16:21:36
I think you're right, and a problem I see is that pretty much all bitcoin startups see themselves as innovators and visionaries but they end up overpromising and under-delivering.  Like big, utopian "Future of Money" ad campaigns and then it takes two weeks to clear a deposit and people think Well why is this such a big deal?    
I think that while most of these companies suck, there's a lot of cool stuff going on with bitcoin in the grassroots/p2p space.  Incidentally, [the biggest p2p site]( for bitcoin remains one of the few where you can buy bitcoins instantly and anonymously.  You meet with a seller face-to-face or put cash into their bank account and have your bitcoins immediately.  It gets ignored or deprecated because it doesn't seem "revolutionary," but the grassroots/p2p face of bitcoin is fast, it works, and it's doing more for bitcoin around the world than any startup.    
There was a neat [post this morning]( in which Andreas Antonopoulous says something similar, that tech/blockchain companies aren't going to do much for bitcoin in the real world, it'll be more about individuals.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:49:00
Exactly, and you probably wouldn't get your $294 for 3–5 business days.  Although a p2p site would allow you to offer your BTC at any price you choose, 4% over market is pretty much the lowest you'll see on [LocalBitcoins]( or [Paxful](  I guess this is because people will pay more for instantaneity and privacy.
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:24:17
Yeah, Bitfinex does that, look at the BTC Swap Rate on [BFXdata]( for current rates, but compounded daily and after Bitfinex's 15% fee it's like 2% annually.  Anything offering significantly higher is likely a Ponzi or other kind of fraud.
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:26:28
I think that almost everybody can get to a phone or computer pretty quickly, and if not, then you're right that they won't be using bitcoin.  There are plenty who use a phone that's shared (perhaps between sibling, a family, or a town) and many people also use a communal computer (e.g. at a library or internet café).  So being able to securely verify BTC transactions without being connected through a phone or computer is a huge benefit, more so because many of these countries also have runaway inflation paired with heavy monetary controls, and thus even greater need for bitcoin.    
Even New Yorkers have no cell signal waiting on the subway platform or when a big hurricane comes around in autumn.  So stuff like SMS tech, code words that can be memorized, or the [Bitcoin Card]( will fill an important role worldwide.
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:17:47
Yes this is exactly what needs to happen, particularly in developing countries.  Often times in Latin America, for example, you would recharge your phone by walking up to the lady who sells candles outside the church or a guy who walks around selling ice cream, and they wear a bright vest that has the name of the telecom on it.  You hand this person some small amount of money and with the Nokia in their pocket or hanging on a lanyard around their neck they will send you the money, which arrives instantly and your phone buzzes in your pocket, no printout receipt or redemption code necessary.    
On the other side of the transaction somebody who spends time in busy areas all day anyway gets to supplement their income, expending no additional time and just marginal effort for the initial training and then extra customers.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:25:17
It's true as far as I know, but as to the LocalBitcoins question, if you buy on Coinbase and try to get a better price by selling outside of their site, then they are monitoring those transactions and will close your account.
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:34:06
Honestly I've found [LocalBitcoins](
) to be a lot better because there are no limits, you can set the price—I do something like bitfinexusd(1.07)(1.01) so that I get 7% over Bitfinex and also pay for the LBC fee—and it happens right away, somebody walks to your bank and puts the cash into your acct.  That being said, read the [security guide](
), and if you're doing this one time, only offer to people who've done a lot of trades with 100% reputation and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:55:29
Thanks, I didn't know they discontinued instant, I guess it's just LocalBitcoins and Mycelium for Android that are left (or jumping through Coinbase's hoops for their version of "instant").
@_date: 2016-01-25 21:21:12
The safest?  Probably [Mycelium for Android]( because you never give up your private keys.  That being said, it's difficult to find anybody to trade with since you have to physically meet up with the counterparty and even when you initiate a trade the flake-out rate is high.  It's anonymous but the premiums you pay both in price and in time are high.    
The exchange with the highest volume that is generally regarded as safe is [Bitfinex]( and if you're purchasing large volumes it makes sense to verify your ID and send a wire there.  [Circle]( [Coinbase]( [LocalBitcoins]( (which is the other anonymous option), or [Uphold]( are all good candidates too, and generally regarded as safe.
@_date: 2016-01-29 02:13:09
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:09:25
I think that Uphold is the worst service of those that I've used so far.  Maybe not side-by-side, but if you compare what they promise to what they deliver they're by far the worst that I've had experience with.
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:25:16
The anonymous options that are generally considered reputable are [LocalBitcoins]( and [Mycelium for Android](
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:53:18
Both [LocalBitcoins]( and [Mycelium for Android]( can be really profitable for trading.  If you look through the forums, there are people who trade full time and make quite a bit.  A lot of flakes and screw-ups too, it's not like it's free money but if you can provide good service to a place that needs BTC then you can do very well.
@_date: 2016-01-31 19:28:28
That's a good idea, you can partner with BTC-oriented search engines like [Spendabit]( etc.  As far as profitability, simply [reselling bitcoin](
) is probably more profitable at the moment, but that may change as more countries get their own bitcoin exchanges and the p2p market loses its monopoly.

If there isn't a lot of competition in your area then [put your own ad up]( on LocalBitcoins or [Mycelium for Android](  Both will allow you to set your own terms &amp; name your price.  People who mine or earn their salary in BTC will sell to you because it's faster and more anonymous than the alternatives.

Hahaha, awesome!  I'm not a long-term holder.  I would like to be but my balance is constantly going to zero when I help friends and friends-of-friends with remittances and transfers and try to get *them* into bitcoin.  I always repurchase, rinse, and repeat.
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:48:10
[Circle]( [Coinbase]( [CoinMate]( [LocalBitcoins]( or [Uphold]( are all fine options.
@_date: 2016-01-04 12:10:36
You can use [Coinbase]( in the UK and they'll give you some bitcoins when you make your first purchase I think.  It's sort of slow and they may want your ID, I don't remember, but at least they're more professional than your average trader on [LocalBitcoins](
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:54:08
Why send a bitcoin that they probably won't know what to do with when you can [sell above market value](
) pretty much anywhere in the US and give the campaign cash?
@_date: 2016-01-11 02:33:03
Sure, good luck and just make sure to use the [security]( features on the site, you're pretty much fully protected as long as you use the site's escrow.
@_date: 2016-01-27 21:05:46
Give it a shot if it interests you, honestly, from [personal experience]( I don't like it although given time they may improve.
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:28:32
If you're going to invest for more than five years then yes, now is a good time to buy.  Because when it reaches $7,500 or $10,000 or $20,000 who really remembers or cares whether they bought at $380 or $170 or whether the charts were forming a head and shoulders pattern.    
If on the other hand you want to sell within three years to make a down payment on a house it may be below $350 and you'll feel like a fool for having bought now.    
And of course if you're going to do something interesting with the bitcoins, particularly something that has a profit margin and that you directly control, then now is the best time.
@_date: 2016-01-26 00:50:07
You're not alone, I think that one of the best things for BTC can be piggy-backing on existing channels of commerce like putting a BATM in 24 hr. shops or being able to buy BTC from the cashier at the drug store.  And tied in importance is the p2p market of [LocalBitcoins]( [Mycelium for Android]( and the like.    
Neither the place where you go to buy milk at 11PM nor the lady at the drug store nor the guy you meet at a Starbucks to get some BTC is as exciting as any one of the bitcoin and blockchain startups that get daily attention, but hype is cheap.  Having a reliable source of BTC within a couple miles of one's house or office will ultimately do more for bitcoin than complicated services that require handing over one's banking info or sending international wires to some overseas exchange.  The average person isn't going to convince their boss to start paying them in bitcoin either, nor should either party want to be doing that at this point in time.
@_date: 2016-01-06 05:51:40
There's an interesting discussion on it on I think while the consensus seems to be that it's outdated, bitcoiners are bipolar about cash.  It's great for anonymity and avoiding currency controls in many parts of the world, at the same time it is unwieldy and takes its time getting places.  A lot of freedom and security can be had if you manage both and can leverage one or the other according to circumstance.
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:06:54
Go to [LocalBticoins]( type in where you live and contact whatever trader you want, somebody may live down the street from you and sell BTC, or maybe you can deposit into your nearest bank.

You'd get 0.48–0.50 bitcoins back because of Coinapult's fees, probably closer to 0.50 because you'd be doing lesser volume and if you'd sent 50 or more bitcoins then you'd pay more in fees.
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:19:47
Either [Coinbase]( [Mycelium for Android]( or [Uphold]( will probably fit the bill.  Coinbase will need to link the acct. behind your debit card, Mycelium is cash only, and Uphold works with debit cards.

Even individuals can easily see what happens past that point with [blockchain.info]( or Bitcoin Core.  Just click on the transactions and see where any bitcoin goes once it's sent and repeat as you wish.  Coinbase uses more robust systems of tracking.  I think for anonymity/pseudonymity you would need to use a mixer.

I wonder who the [online sellers in Beijing]( are.  Are these actually people from the government?  Why are there no local cash sellers?
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:09:25
Maybe the ["buy online"]( feature on LocalBitcoins?  You can deposit into a bank account even if you don't have one of your own, send money as a remittance, buy a money order at the PO, send cash in an insured envelope, and there are a bunch of other methods.    
Just read the [guide]( and the particular seller's instructions, apparently it's a safe way of buying, although I am still skeptical as to why somebody would mail cash in an envelope.  But I guess it works.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:08:17
Yeah, I really like it except for the couple of times that the buyer backed out or the order got canceled for whatever reason.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:46:33
Bitcoin is a great way to do this, I don't know what your costs are in India but in the [US BTC sells for pretty high]( so you'd likely make money on the transaction, just pay tax on the profits made through the purchase and resale.  You get to keep the profit left over after taxes and it's better than paying for and waiting for a bank wire.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:28:49
If those daily returns were reinvested it would be far more, 1.01ˆ365.25=3,788% per year and after one decade an investment of one dollar would reach a number with sixteen digits.  The entirety of the money that exists on the planet is no more than a fifteen digit number, in USD.    
I don't know what  "a fairly large amount of btc" equates to, but say it's $10,000–100,000, this 1%/day investment scheme yields five orders of magnitude more than all the earth's money in ten measly years.
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:35:05
I've done something very similar, a friend's girlfriend Alice (let's say) needed to send money to Pakistan and a buddy Bob with an account in Pakistan wanted to send money to Australia (where Alice and I were).  So Bob transferred the rupees to Alice's family's account within Pakistan (never left the country, therefore no fees) and Alice gave dollars to me, which I think I just gave to the guy Bob needed to pay.  I could have walked into a bank and deposited as well.  So neither Alice nor Bob paid any wire fees or currency conversion (we just looked the exact rate up on Google) and no money actually ever left Australia or Pakistan.  The only thing that crossed the border was an agreement between Alice and Bob, with me facilitating because I knew them both.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:43:00
Did you try [posting your own ad]( instead of responding to others'?  If you don't have luck there then [Purse]( would work, unfortunately it's not instant.  I think lots of people are paranoid about Amazon gift cards because they're easy to cancel, reverse, or use for oneself after receiving the bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:37:23
No, this doesn't exist.  The closest thing is [Circle]( whose app lets you take a photo of your debit card and buy and receive instantly.  But I'm sure they ask you for verification.
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:28:46
No, they charge the 1% and $0.15 ACH fee (if applicable) separately, so the rate you see isn't the rate you get, you'll actually *pay* at least 1% more and therefore *get* 1% less than it looks like you should get.  And definitely, if you weren't buying a full BTC then $4 difference has to be fees, not just price movement.
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:15:12
It seems like the European banking system is too good to necessitate bitcoin, but I can certainly see advantages combining [LocalBitcoins]( or [Mycelium for Android]( with Bitwala for those who don't use banks (or try not to).  Particularly for those in less developed parts of the world (or financially less developed like the US) who need to pay things in Europe.
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:10:33
[Bitcoinwisdom.com]( has a setting called "Depth Range" that shows this exact statistic at any moment, now for example putting a $100,000 buy order on Bitfinex would cause bitcoin to go up 0.32%, on that exchange at least.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:34:36
Yeah [LocalBitcoins]( is good for this.  The seller doesn't need to be in your area, just look at the Buy online listings.

Statistically it's almost certain that now is not the ideal time to buy; a better price will come along if you wait.

@_date: 2016-02-01 03:46:22
There are in fact horror stories every so often on the [forum]( almost always concerning PayPal reversals.  Apparently it's pretty easy to do, the fraudster just calls PayPal to complain and PayPal support usually oils the squeaky wheel.  Hence I always use cash deposits to my or the company bank account—only I can withdraw, with my ID.  Bank policies prohibit random people from taking money out of an account that's in my name only, even if that person has made a deposit into my account, they have to contact me first.  I offer only to established users with 100% feedback mostly because new users are more likely to flake and there's enough demand that I can be selective.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:10:47

@_date: 2016-02-01 03:30:55
The online portion is pretty large, but there's still a face-to-face part of the site "Buy bitcoins with cash" I think it's called.  And no, sometimes when I'm doing payments for my company I'll use it in three different countries in the same day, there's no need to be in the same city or even country if you're using any of the "Buy/Sell bitcoins online" methods.  Just read the [guides on the site]( use escrow **always**, and don't even make the ad visible to new/low volume users.  As long as you have bitcoins, having a new account won't matter.
@_date: 2016-02-06 16:13:30
I would say to get some colones from one of the [local trader in San José](  I sometimes do that while traveling.  It's not really about the conversion or saving fees (sometimes I would be better off just using a bank), rather you'll meet one of the few bitcoiners in Costa Rica and get a glimpse into the activity and expectations for that country and for Central America.

Haven't used Quickbt.com but I had the same problem with [Uphold]( they said it was going to be instant and it ended up taking over a week.  The only really anonymous and instant services that haven't failed me so far are [LocalBitcoins]( and [Mycelium for Android](
@_date: 2016-02-04 20:58:04
Tough to say, [the seller]( has near perfect feedback so it could be that it's not a scam but some sort of laundering scheme.  [The forum]( is a good place too to ask about this kind of thing or browse previous threads.

I would love to get 100% of my salary in BTC because I know that I can sell them at an 11% markup pretty much any day of the week in nearly any [city on LocalBitcoins]( a couple times I've used [Mycelium for Android]( too.  This means that, if you're earning exclusively in bitcoin you're paying for stuff at 1.11ˆ-1 which is very close to a 10% discount (9.9% I think).
@_date: 2016-02-09 02:18:39
Yep, Circle used to be marginally better than Coinbase, both are kind of crummy services now and there are others that I'd say are an order of magnitude better in terms of speed, fees, etc.
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:29:45
Sorry to hear that you can't use those services any longer.    
You may want to [sell on LocalBitcoins](
) and have the cash deposited to your account or given to you in person if you're more comfortable with that.  If you sell for cash deposit to a bank, the safest way to do this is to tailor the ad you post so that it's only available to users with, say 25+ BTC in volume and 100% reputation (this filters out new and malicious accounts) and only release the bitcoins in escrow once the bank is closed and you have the cash in your hand.    
If you want to trade face-to-face you can also use [Mycelium for Android](
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:36:57
Yes, you'd be charged with receiving stolen property among other things.
@_date: 2016-02-05 21:34:43
If you're going for most popular I think that's [Bitfinex]( by volume.  They have a pretty robust platform and charge 0.1% in fees.  In the US [Circle]( [Coinbase]( [LocalBitcoins](
), [Mycelium for Android]( and [Uphold]( are all good options.  LocalBitcoins will probably get you the most $/BTC the fastest although it has a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the [price equations]( avoiding scams, etc.  You can also just turn your BTC now into stuff you want on Amazon and get a discount through [Purse](
@_date: 2016-02-04 17:13:33
Post a [sell ad on LBC]( limit availability to high-volume users with 100% reputation to avoid time wasters, set your price with the [pricing guide]( or just put a simple % margin, then somebody drives or walks to BoA and puts the cash into your acct.
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:42:08
A bunch of giftcards get bought and sold on [LocalBitcoins]( but if that specific offer isn't available then [post an ad]( of your own and you can set the price.

I don't see bitcoin doing good on a nationwide scale.  I do see some smart traders making profits and their clients perhaps protecting themselves when I look at the [p2p market in that country](  However, these two, small groups are likely the sorts of people who had access to international banks as well as extralegal workarounds beforehand.  They had assets outside of naira and didn't need saving.

How about a multisig where the payer and translator each have a key and then a multilingual professional in some related field (linguistics, copywriting, translation, etc.) holds the third key?  That way if there's ever a disagreement about the accuracy of the translation, a non-biased expert would step in and adjudicate.  And then the professional gets 1% of the amount of each successful job, and in the event of a poorly-done job, the payer disputes and gets a 100% refund.  The translator's reputation gets knocked a point and the idea would be that there's rarely a dispute, but a robust system exists for resolving the occasional one that arises.
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:03:58
Yep, [LocalBitcoins Australia]( is anonymous (as long as the seller doesn't explicitly require ID) and LocalBitcoins has a wallet with bitcoins from many accounts mixed together so your BTCs come out already tumbled.  Credit card and PayPal obviously aren't going to work.

Thanks so much for posting this, that was a phenomenal reply he gave.  I think that what he said about knowledge and skill is terrific investing advice, at this point if all of Antonopoulos's bitcoins went to zero (he even said that he doesn't have many) he would still be very much ahead both financially, intellectually, personally, and professionally.  Nor would he be "back to square one" in any real sense because most of the intangibles he's acquired and talked about would continue to pay "dividends" of their own.

@_date: 2016-02-01 16:41:22
Do something that generates a dividend or interest.  Cash out the profit in dollars, and keep the BTC principal.  This could be [interest on BTC deposits via Bitfinex]( [trading on the local market via LocalBitcoins]( or [Mycelium for Android]( or a more alternative investment like playing around with the BTC on different services, sites, and wallets to increase your knowledge on the subject.  Education, after all, turns out to be a pretty great investment, in tech-related fields especially.
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:42:00
Not worth doing if you're not comfortable with it.  FWIW I've never had a problem converting BTC to cash on an as-needed basis.  It seems like  and  could have been avoided by auto-filtering out all but high-volume 100% (i.e. old, high-reputation) accounts and that  2, and 3 could have been avoided by specifying that the BTCs wouldn't be released until after bank closing hours.    
Why not just keep the bitcoins?  Every service and exchange has horror stories and none has existed for more than five years.  On the other hand, if you're the only one with the private keys to your bitcoins then nothing can go wrong.
@_date: 2016-02-06 00:52:03
I think "volume in Brazil" is a little misleading, if it were *only* 456,000 USD then individual *buyers* (not traders) on the [Brazilian p2p market]( are doing 7% of the entire country's volume.

Both [LocalBitcoins]( and [Mycelium for Android]( are great for small amounts.  Both are anonymous and instant, unless the counterparty states otherwise.

By far, cash deposit to my bank.  I make the ad visible to people who have &gt;25 BTC volume and 100% reputation, then the buyer drives or walks to a branch and puts the cash in my acct. so that it's available to me immediately.  I've always been able to do this at 11% markup except a couple times when I cut it in half to 5.5% because I had to sell quickly.  
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:11:45
Holy shit, the [Indian p2p market]( is super efficient too, buy–sell margins are at 1.0% net of fees, which is the lowest I think I've seen.  Most decentralized p2p markets if you buy and sell back to somebody you've already lost like 10%, sometimes way more in markets where BTC is thinly traded or else monopolized.
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:36:06
The best [offers in London]( are 3–4% above market at the moment but put in your own bid offering UK bank transfer.  Take a look at the [pricing guide]( and with 0–1% above market you should show up on the first page.  Your bid should get scooped up quickly and there's very little risk for you since your counterparty will have to send BTC to escrow to even open the trade.  Bear in mind as the one offering, you're responsible for a 1% fee so just price it in.
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:40:51
There may be better offers on [Mycelium for Android](  A lot of the ridiculously high prices on LocalBitcoins are misleading, traders have hidden ads and individual agreements with volume buyers.  You're also free to [put up your own ad]( with terms that you find more fair.    
Something like [Bitfinex]( would make sense if you're buying a few thousand dollars worth.
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:16:26
Literally one of the most popular payment methods on [LocalBitcoins USA]( is cash deposit to Wells Fargo.  [Put up your own ad](
) and you'll also have control over pricing, who can buy (e.g. users with 100+ volume in BTC and 100% reputation), it's instant, oh, and you'll get at least 500 basis points over Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-02-05 17:30:44
Still a ton of sellers doing p2p when I [look at the map]( maybe ATMs are just impractical.  Somebody needs to be there to fill and/or empty it, G4S among others train their employees to do this, but unless you're a big bank you probably can't negotiate a good price with them.  If one breaks down or something and it's doing very little volume, the owners will probably be hesitant to fix it immediately since it looks like a losing investment.    
In this respect I think people view BATMs like miners sometimes, as if it's a free money machine when in reality it turns into a loss most of the time.
@_date: 2016-02-06 10:06:54
Exactly, although now the paradox is that even if my favorite grocery store started accepting BTC tomorrow, I'd be excited and I'd tell people about it, but I wouldn't spend my bitcoins there.  Not unless they offered a steep discount, because why spend 1.0 BTC when I can sell 0.9 BTC, use the cash and get the same amount of stuff?
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:13:14

Even if, just as a jumping off point, there were one student on each college campus making extra money buying and selling bitcoin it would get the ball rolling.  Because the [LocalBitcoins map]( ([Mycelium for Android]( more so) is pretty sparse in the middle of the country.  If there were at least one dot in every college town then bitcoin would be ubiquitous.  And if a significant portion of average people's first point of contact with bitcoin is buying face-to-face, doing so in a university coffee shop with somebody who's really interested and passionate about it I think would do a lot to improve bitcoin's acceptance and reputation.
@_date: 2016-02-04 00:24:17
I totally agree with you.  For something like this to dominate and become a killer app it needs to be at least 10X better than the alternatives.  That doesn't mean one great idea, it means starting with the great idea and constantly improving and tweaking it, layering ease of use, interface, service/support, and usability to incrementally reach that factor of ten or more.  And above all, make it fucking work *every time, without fail*.    
Having to put orders in only to have them canceled, time after time, to get a 20% discount isn't game changing.  Because I can sell bitcoins at 11% over market pretty much anywhere with [regular old p2p]( and that corresponds to a 10% discount that's never failed me, is always fast, and gives me control by using my own card, accounts, and selecting who can buy the BTC from me.  If Purse stalls or gets lazy in its improvement it will become one more startup in a sea of lousy ones.
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:17:32
Amazon ships to Ireland, I've also had fairly good experience with [**Purse.io**]( in terms of discounts.  A couple times the BTC buyer backed out and I have to order the products again, so if it's not super urgent stuff then you should be able to get at least 20% off.  You may have to build a profile first.
