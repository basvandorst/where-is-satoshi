What op is saying is that " since wallet is hard to use for not to tech people, they have to keep their bitcoins on an exchange instead of their personal wallet." Although I understand why op is saying it but I do not agree completely.
Email or browsing internet was hard to use a decade ago for most of non tech people however only a small learning curve is required if you really try it. Today kids as small as 5 years know how to find their cartoon channel on youtube.

Total volume is meaningless at houbi. Chinese would buy at 3500 cny and sell after 30 seconds at 3501 cny and make 1 cny profit.
zero trading fees can lead to high volumes. But in reality the same coins are sold and bought hundred times a day giving false impression of actual movement.

Network effect is just an illusive term used by bitcoiners to dampen the enthuiasm of other altcoins. Where was the network effect when price of ltc vs btc rose from 0.01 to 0.04 four months ago. Its still holding steady at 0.03.
And by definition network effect should have crushed litecoin by now as bitcon  keeps growing and as time passes. but In fact every rise in bitcoin , leads to double rise in litecoin.
I by no means am saying that every altcoin is legit and will survive. However if there is a big community and support for an alt coin it will rise no matter how much bitcoiners hate them. If dogecoiners are fanatic about their coin and keep doing wonderful charities and keep growing then they have a very good chance of survival.

Even at 25 satoshi when dogecoin daily maintenance cost was 1/8 of today, it was still in top 3. By the articles criteria it should never reach to 50 satoshi. But not only it reached 50 satoshi but maintained it and jumped to 100 satoshi. At 100 satoshi daily maintenance cost was half of today but that would still make doge most costly of all coins. Still people bought it and is now stable at 180 satoshi. If price prediction was that simple there would be no exchanges, just online stores where you can buy alt currencies.

Sidechain is nothing but a futile attemp by bitcoiners to kill altcoins. 
Just like how bitcoiners used the term "network effect" to kill litecoin when it was 0.01 BTC. However it backfired and litecoin rose to 0.05 before stabilising at 0.025. Wait for another bitcoin boom and litecoin will rise to 0.1 BTC.

I dont trust this number juggling. Its only half the analysis. If this analysis were true i should never have bought dogecoin at 25 satoshi. However i did because of its wonderful community and currently i am sitting at 800% gains.
I interpret it this way " Even if dogecoin have highest daily maintenance cost, there is enough interest from new members that the coin daily maintenance cost is more than absorbed by the dogecoin" . Also reward halving is not far only 12 more days to go. And then another halving after 2 months and so on till reward max reach 10,000 per block.

But bitcoin is overvalued compared to other coins. Almost all major exchanges have litecoin.

Risks vs Rewards analysis 101.
It would be like selling BTC for $100 in last August. We are right in middle of two pumps. Grow some balls and wait.. If you still feel the same after 3-6 months go ahead and sell. That way your loss could be 10  to 30 percent compared to today's price if BTC is still in downtrend. But if we are in uptrend your profits will be 100% to 200%.

Or put it other way. 40% of the dogecoins have been mined, 60% remaining. Interest from investors and community members in the past 5-6 weeks was enough to absorb the 40% of the lifetime maintenance cost. Over the future only 3/2 more investors or members need to join the dogecoin community for the price to remain sustainable.

Copied from monero bitcointalk
XMR is more qualitatively similar to mixing implementations like CoinJoin. The differences arise in the departure from the Bitcoin protocol, which allows XMR to use new cryptography to provide decentralized and trustless mixing of superior quality. The critical problem with mixing services is the need to trust the operators. As an example, blockchain.info's mixer gives the following disclaimer: "However if the server was compromised or under subpoena it could be force to keep logs. If this were to happen although you haven't gained any privacy you haven't lost any either."
The CoinJoin-inspired Darkcoin performs mixing with selected "masternodes" since it still uses ordinary signatures that can be mapped one-to-one. The motivation is that a randomly selected node is less likely than a single service to exhibit bad faith (such as keeping logs) . In practice, a few VPS companies host the vast majority of nodes and this approach relies on the integrity and good behavior of these nodes. XMR's more fundamental cryptographic approach doesn't have these vulnerabilities and the quality of anonymity is much higher.
XMR's ring signatures are also far more secure and convenient than CoinJoin because they mix outputs not transactions. This means a transaction doesn't involve waiting around for other senders to mix with. Nor is a user restricted to mixing only if others are sending the same amount. Arbitrary amounts can be sent at any time without anyone else's participation. This feature makes a timing analysis of the blockchain useless.

MTGOX has filed for bankruptcy protection. there is nothing you can do now. when a decision will be made on MTGOX bankruptcy all users having funds will be notified.
And depending on how much fund MTGOX actually have they will be distribured to the users depending on how much funds users actually had.
Last week MTGOX said they were short  800K bitcoins. with current findings of 200k btc they will be actually short of 600 BTC. while users had 800 BTC in MTGOX. hence those 200 btc will be distributed to the users probably on a prorata basis of 0.25 btc per 1 btc.

Long term believer in bitcoins never decrease their bitcoin holdings. They either
A) buy new bitcoins and then spend them at retailers. This helps both bitcoin believers as more adoption will lead to increase in bitcoin price and retailers as their sell volume will increase. So what if buyer have to pay the fees involved. Its peanuts compared to potential gains when bitcoin price doubles again in few months.
B) they only spend bitcoins that they were eventually going to sell on exchange. I.e. if I bought few bitcoins in april 2013 @ 200 usd per btc and if I think I want to cashout few of my holdings, I will spend them at retailers now and buy back bitcoins at exchange when price drops to 600ish.
Think of retailers accepting bitcoins as an exchange to sell bitcoins.

Couple of decades ago we thought cables are only for phones until optical fibres got accepted by internet networks. We thought a disk cannot handle more than 1.4MB.
Just saying "necessasity is mother of invention". 
We may not cure commoncold but I am sure wireless internet on grand scale wont be a problem in future.
@_date: 2014-04-18 04:47:00
That's what diluting bitcoin a lot.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:20:21
Thank you for kind words.
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:48:39
Yeah.same as bitcoin is scam for fiat lovers.
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:54:22
Only 50k in circulation + 10.5 million premined.
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:59:46
Unless you have been mining cryptos fore more than a year, I would suggest buying bitcoins would be better than entering into mining.

Tl;dr 
OKCoin recharge code now online, pause CMB recharge, withdrawals normal

They can't easily sell it. But if they are believers they would want to hold the stock for a long time and only sell it when the time is right. that stock might be worth 2 to 10 times in future and will be worth the trouble selling it for cash discretely.
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:03:40
Only if we can learn first not to downvote inspirational posts.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:27:35
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-03-20 03:21:15
try posting it in @_date: 2014-01-13 14:39:37
I would buy your bitcoins at 400 now and pay you 100% premium on your prediction. Lol looks like you sold yours in a hurry and want to buy back cheap.
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:44:27
Tipping to twitch! Great.
Eventhough it is great news for cryptos in general, I am not surprised it is downvoted to hell. Welcome to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-13 09:51:26
I am not promoting doge. I am just defending doge. I have bitcoins and I have dogecoins.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:50:31
Already been pumped and dumped.  Too many  flaws in this coin.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:59:01
Don't know why people hate Dogecoin? 
* Is it because it dilutes bitcoin?
* Is it because it creates a not-so-serious image of cryptocurrency?
I honestly think its the first bullet point. Because if it is the second bullet point then, in defence it sure does introduces a lot of newbies to cryptocurrency and then leading to bitcoins.
Initially I too believed dogecoin was just a meme, but not sure now. specially since bitcoiners hate it so much, it must be good.
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:21:34
It would be wise to but bitcoins than to invest in mining. In last 6 months less than 50 percent miners who invested in asics are better of compared to buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:43:17
If i sell now it will be a Déjà vu of selling BTC for 100 USD in May 2013
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:58:51
You can still mine dogecoin. Post a question there. @_date: 2014-02-25 14:03:53
Not again please..... just read previous fucking dozen posts for this.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:36:35
Will never work. Anyone can generate billions of dollars just like ripple out of thin air. 
The challenge is acceptance. And general public will have a hard time accepting a currency that is 99.5% owned/generated/controlled by a private institution.
The only reason speculators are buying it is in the hope that they will find a greater fool to buy from them in future at higher price.
@_date: 2014-02-18 04:41:18
Are you for real or just after some tips? 
Redditor for only a week. 
Thank god we dont throw away tips like they do in or OP would be rich by now.
@_date: 2014-03-20 03:55:10
create your own subreddit and become mod.
Simple. Thats how decentralisation works.
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:49:10
DO NOT DO IT. 
You will never get bitcoins that way, no matter how much cash you send. Bitcoin is wild wild west.
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:54:52
Not bad for a coin 2 months old.  
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:38:06
He never said he was technical person. He claimed to be journalist. And he was. He is welcome to DOGECOIN.
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:18:18
I hate fucking dogecoin. stop throwing me pennies and go play happy puppy over at your subreddit.
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:42:07
Its not feasible. If govt launches a currency like ripple with huge premine kept for itself, then its no different than fiat. 
If not premined, they have no control over the price and cannot possibly regulate its usage or manipulate supply and demand hence no different than bitcoin. There are no gains in it for the government. Why bould they bother.
Also govt would be responsible for prevention of 51p attack and securing network and in case of failure liable to cover losses to people. Why would they bother to launch bitcoin clone?
@_date: 2014-03-17 09:10:37
Will give it a go. Looks good.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:09:48
This goes against everything bitcoin stands for.
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:02:20
Ha ha must read my ass. One clone bashing another and accusing it for clone.
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:57:04
OP is a pumper and dumper of worst kind. He has been posting speculative or manipulative content in at least 4 alt coins sections in last 3 days. A very recent post of op stating dogecoin will be added on coinbase.
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:58:58
Stop associating your scamcoin with bitcoin. Even xrp is better than aurora, atleast they accept that they will own and  control majority of the premined coins. 
Go back to your own subreddit where there are exactly 10 people (and i guess less than 1 icelander and more than nine pumpers and dumpers) online.
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:59:43
So you created this account 3 hrs ago just to post this. Get a life and GTFO this subreddit.
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:50:13
It is a fud to kill alt coins.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:21:03
Summary please? Cant watch videos.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:58:16
 I dont trust sites that lists any premined centralised currencies. Ripple, mastercoin and nxt should not be on the same list.
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:13:38
Monero any day. 
Cpu only. Completely new protocol. No premine. No ipo. Completely privacy centric.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:35:26
Fuck off with your shitcoin and penny tips.
