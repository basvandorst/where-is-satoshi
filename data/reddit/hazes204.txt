The whole economy is a bubble.

Although its seems the focus of Bitcoin investers shifted to making money( I too profit), this is definitly not the main reason I hold BTC and alts. I still believe strong this is a revolution and I want to be part of it.

History of BITCOIN

Will it pass $1000..NO ITS A BUBBLE 
Will it pass $10000.NO ITS A BUBBLE
And now we have, will it pass $19000 again?  Lol
"Would u pay 19K for a bitcoin, if you would not then dont assume that anyone else will"
Yeah because we all make the same amount of money right?  We are all in the same tax bracket so we a think alike WTF KIND OF LOGIC IS THIS.

BTC price reflects the hate against greedy banks. It will only grow, the problems that you described with BTC will be fixed when the perfect altcoin rises to solve the issues. And just for calling people that are invested in BTC ignorant and stupid, KARMA WILL GET YOU

Yes, we are on the same page then. I however do not believe +/-10K is where the bubble goes pop for BTC.

And Crypto has real tech that will shape our future  behind it.

Without any trolling means, I would not be shocked if it was 10K on 01-01-2018. I got interested in BTC when it was 3K(few months ago) some would say I was to late, but its at 7K+, the community around Crypto is great even greater is the tech behind many coins.

I see it as a start for crypto entering the world, people that did alot of research on the tech of alt coins (that are better than BTC) know this is just the beginning.

Now before I give my answer, please know that it is based on my little brains knowledge. I think 2018 will be the year of the Crypto, it is spreading everywhere these days, which means alot of money will flow into BTC and make it worth more, this is no doubt in my mind because BTC and its community has been through alot, even RIGHT NOW. Its still 5600€ or something. But for the future (7+yrs) I think ETH, LSK, VTC, and IOTA will be the big players.
