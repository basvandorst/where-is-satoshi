Or it's trading algorithms reacting to the phrase "blockchain." That doesn't mean we're not in a cryptocurrency bubble, but I tend to think it's more a failing company trying to grab headlines. Even with this "skyrocket" result, their price is roughly were it was back in mid June -- about $6, up from $2 -- so it's not like we're seeing some utterly insane result here. Those shares have been sold for as much as $11.5 as recently as mid 2016, so let's take this whole thing with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:20:36
So, you're in favor of adding even more middlemen? You WANT to pay someone for every transaction you make, rather than just buy a product outright? You want an additional party involved in your transactions? You're welcome to your perspective, but I don't share it.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:32:17
So I can optionally donate, or if I decide not to, I can non-optionally donate?
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:20:24
Seriously devs, listen to this guy. If you were charging a $5 or $10 fee for this thing, I'd have zero problems with it. Or if you were offering the option to download it for free and then optionally donate dust, I'd be fine with it. Instead, you seem to be rationalizing a service fee. I don't want you inserting yourself in my transactions, period. That you don't grasp this is a HUGE RED FLAG for your ethics as bitcoin developers.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:47:32
And a non-optional 1000 satoshi fee to MultiBit with every transaction. Not mentioned anywhere below. Super sketchy guys.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:22:58
Nope. It raises even more red flags.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:26:00
You're intentionally missing my greater point. It doesn't matter how often you collect a fee you imposed and send it to yourself. You're still inserting yourself in a process in a shady way that I don't support. You're still making the transactions more traceable. You're not doing this because it's important to the process, you're doing it as a service fee. I won't be using your service, and I think everyone who is considering doing so needs to be aware of the risks and the ethics involved. You took this path, and now you're getting feedback. Ignore it if you don't like it. But I suspect you'll find that this makes a lot of people in the bitcoin community very uneasy, and they won't use your product in its current form specifically because of this fee structure.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:54:06
Who is asking for it to be free? Everyone here is concerned that there's a traceable, non-optional service fee with every transaction. Several people, including me, have said "Why not just charge for it? This way seems really sketchy." I stand by that. There's plenty of ways for the devs to get paid without inserting themselves into every transaction a wallet makes.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:44:08
Absolutely not. Not cool. Not ethical. Not bitcoin. I'm done with MultiBit.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:57:41
I shouldn't have to explain this to you. The whole point of bitcoin is to get the middlemen out of the process of sending money over the internet. It's that whole "reduced friction" thing you might have heard about. You're intentionally, non-optionally and non-openly adding a payment to yourselves into this process. If I wanted this kind of relationship with a product that holds my money, I'd go with a bank app. 
If you need to make money from this wallet, put it on the open market and sell it. Don't become another bloodsucker. The fact that you've done this means that you don't get why I, and other people like me, use bitcoin in the first place.
I did read your post. I disagree with both how and why you're doing it. I'm not using your product, and I'm telling other people my opinion. The end.

What point are you arguing here, exactly? That someone with an open-source code I can compile myself from github is LESS trustworthy than someone who won't open their code in the first place?

My guess is that it would also show incriminating track-covering after the coins were stolen or otherwise lost. It sure looks like they were shuffling funds around at the end to keep the ship afloat.
Until those addresses are known, there's nothing concrete to base a fraud case around, just a vague statement that the coins are gone and they're very sorry. After those addresses are known, there's a good possibility of a criminal case and jail time. I see why they're holding back.

Time could prove me an absolute fool, but I think the worst is over for the moment. It's easy to forget because we're all stuck in bitcoin-hypertime, but the China/Mt.Gox/IRS blizzard all happened in just over two months. Yeah, some pessimism was called for.
But even after all that (I'm assuming we're all on the same page that China is basically out of the game for a while), Bitcoin held up really well. $450? Sucks for sure if you bought after November, but today's low is still nearly double what the previous high was.
And look at where Bitcoin itself is. Governments all over the world have no-bullshit official policies for it. Wall Street is salivating, waiting for the SecondMarket dinner bell. There's $100 million in VC funding pushing it forward. You can buy stuff online with it without having to fuck with Tor. If you live in a big city, you can even buy real-world things like food.
So, I'm hoping I'm at informed optimism.

Agreed, but even if it's a hugely expensive, kind of bad card, at least it's a step in the direction of mainstreaming bitcoin. I'd be very surprised if Coinbase (or one of their partners) wasn't working on exactly the same thing.

Apart from those of us who bought profit-based shares getting screwed over, it doesn't seem like Neo's failure means very much. Yes, the people in Cyprus probably are like "Crazy internet fad," but it's not like Neo was actually setting up accounts. They were talking about setting up accounts and advertising a lot.
What I'm getting at here is that it's not like Mt.Gox where a bunch of people who had real money invested in bitcoins themselves got burned. It was just non-equity shareholders who lost the value of their shares, which are still readily available on Havelock. The shares are still there, they're just worthless because the company ran out of money.
It sucks, don't get me wrong, but the actual amount of damage done outside of people who knew they were taking a risk with a startup wasn't very big.

Inflation is mostly to support businesses, not people. The idea is to keep prices rising so that there's always a profit (even if it's just a paper one) at each step of the transaction. If the price of a good deflates, the profit numbers go down even if the total cash value is basically the same. The thinking is that businesses will be reluctant to buy raw materials or invest if they suspect that they can get a better deal by waiting until their money is worth more.
There's actually an OK post on this over at Zero Hedge, just remember to filter out the hyperbole: 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:31:03
Hahaha ... Nearly half a million REAL dollars for TWO domain naimes? And they aren't even porn domains? This really is like the dotcom boom. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:07:14
They'd have to get direct exposure to bitcoin to use those. Investing in the SecondMarket trust (and the countless other that are coming) means they can profit off of bitcoin's rise without ever having to deal with bitcoin directly, and with all of the protections of a normal security.
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:54:39
I don't think it was a scam. I think it was more-or-less like any failed startup. A smart, inexperienced guy has half-baked idea founded on the premise that it "can't possibly fail" because of reasons. It does all of the things it's supposed to do, but runs headfirst into a not-unlikely situation no one actually planned for, and ran out of money in the process. It happens every day.
If it had been a scam, the hype would have happened before they took everyone's money, not after. As it stands, pretty much everyone involved with this loses.
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:56:07

The more interesting thing to me in all this is that he keeps dismissing the idea of doing anything other than getting Mt.Gox back up and running, and with a TOTAL focus on security. Maybe they actually did find a lot of the coins, and he's hoping against hope that if/when they relaunch people will actually keep their deposits. Totally unrealistic belief, if true, but interesting.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:48:52
The Bitcoin Core software itself is surely backed up on CD/DVD somewhere, and I'd bet that the blockchain is backed up daily by security-minded miners and people using non-light wallets in places that wouldn't be prone to the EMP.
That said, all currency would be pretty much worthless. There's not enough physical cash in circulation to do much of anything. It's only like 8% of "currency." Bitcoin would probably beat every other money system in term of coming back online, just because it's distributed and doesn't need any central authority to turn on the lights.
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:02:01
There's a screenshot in the story that shows 165,000 BTC (which we may already know about) and then a bunch of smaller transactions that could have just been overlooked as normal investor transactions. I'm not a tx-detective, but it may be worth looking into.
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:02:01
You really need to learn the basics of bitcoin before you post this kind of thing. Bitcoin is divisible down to a tiny fraction of a "full" bitcoin, and an average person can buy 0.1 BTC or 0.00001 BTC very easily today.
If you're really worried about it, start using the "bits" or "mBTC" notation.

I think you're misunderstanding my point: I don't want to create a collection of brainwallet addresses to put things into. I'm trying to create a list of brainwallets to keep people who aren't as smart as our good and polite friends here from putting money into them in the first place. This public list would be something wallet providers could pull from to warn people trying to use those public/private keys.
The whole idea is that YES, BRAINWALLETS ARE INSECURE. Also, NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS. So, I'm proposing A THING TO HELP THEM NOT GET FUCKED OVER.
If you don't think it's a decent idea, fine. Maybe it's not. I'll probably set it up anyway, because what's the harm in warning people what addresses suck?
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:28:57
You're completely missing my point. That bitcoin is worth ANYTHING on that time scale is impressive. That the individual unit (which isn't meaningless at all, since that's the scale we're measuring it in) has even achieved parity with the Yen is amazing, never mind the dollar.
Saying "individual unit value is meaningless" is like saying "measurements aren't real" or "a kilogram is just a thing some guy made up." It's actually extremely meaningful because it provides a context by which we can make comparisons. The market cap, by comparison, is COMPLETELY meaningless without it. (Current trade price times total number of units is all the market cap represents.)

What strange logic. You'd rather PAY MORE in fees on valid transactions to offset COMPLETE LOSSES on invalid ones than pay negligible fees and have at least one payment channel where payment fraud is impossible? And you want to keep giving money to the credit card company that can't be bothered to effectively screen out fraudulent cards on their own payment network?
I get what you're saying, but isn't the better option to build up the channel that can't be shut down by a credit card company in the first place, and which can't be used for fraudulent transactions in any case? You have ZERO control over the credit card transaction, you have TOTAL control over the bitcoin one. Aren't your efforts going to be better spent moving towards bitcoin as fast as you can? And encouraging mass adoption as much as possible?
Yes, in the short-term it will be a pain in the ass. But your existing credit card situation isn't going to change, and given the recent news about the major banking hacks, it's probably about to get much, much worse. You're already at risk of losing your ability to accept cards even without adopting bitcoin. So why not protect yourself against all that by actually moving towards a non-broken system?
@_date: 2014-08-29 18:08:59
He wasn't Satoshi.
There's little similarity between their writing styles, and there are countless examples of the two of them emailing each other well before bitcoin was anything beyond a cool idea. It would be a REALLY weird thing to have a fake conversation like that using one real identity and one made up one just in case a totally experimental technology that, at that point hadn't even been coded yet, became a world-changing technology worth billions.
Plus, if he was Satoshi, he'd have already cashed out by now to cover medical costs and the like. Since Finney already cashed out most of his BTC, mined almost as early as Satoshi's, why would he not cash out the rest now that it's worth a fortune? He could singlehandedly fund generations of ALS and cryogenic research with the $590 million or so currently controlled by Satoshi.
Interesting theory, but I don't think it adds up.
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:33:06
You're demonstrated my point, mate. Even the **suggestion** that there's elitism in bitcoin is rustling your jimmies something fierce.
Here's an experiment to try: Write a n00b-level question about, say, what wallet to use or exchange to buy at, and post it on any number of bitcoin message boards. See how many actually helpful replies you get, versus how much trolling and "133ter-than-thou" posturing.

My understanding is that it's possible to pull off in principle, but absurdly impractical in a real-world setting. Trying to scam a cup of coffee would be all but impossible, just because of how difficult it would be to time. The risk for a merchant accepting even a moderate amount is negligible.
In an online context it would be easier to pull off, although still pretty unreliable even in ideal conditions, and there's also more incentive for the recipient to wait for a few confirmations before finalizing the deal. Trying to scam someone in a context with normal shipping time would be impossible, so it's mostly only a problem with instant transactions, like music downloads.
In any case, it's several orders of magnitude more difficult than credit card fraud.
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:48:08
Or it's one person or a small group controlling the 650,000 BTC stolen from Mt. Gox trying to cash in on new demand every time something big happens. It would look like coordinated market manipulation, but its really just one guy trying to launder hundreds of millions of dollars as fast as possible without totally crashing the price in the process.

Considering that the definition of "bad money" is in Gresham's law a debased currency, which bitcoin specifically isn't, the only lesson here is that Williams is really bad at his job. 
This is exactly like someone in 1975 saying that if U.S. citizen were allowed to own gold again, that people would immediately start hoarding dollars and using gold, thus causing global instability. It's ludicrous. He's on the wrong side of this, and now grasping at straws.

To be fair, the same thing happened when a reputable news outlet in the U.S. reported that Dorian Nakamoto was the inventor of bitcoin. It was everywhere. With the PBoC not actually releasing information, I'm really skeptical that we have the whole story. A bank ban is completely plausible, but at the moment it's just as plausible that the one story we're getting is wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:59:24
I agree. It's totally and completely insecure. That said, if we assume that at least some people are still going to want brainwallets -- even if we all know how horribly stupid that is -- wouldn't it be a good thing to have some easy resource to prevent the most obvious and common ones from getting stolen? Some hacker has already done it, I'm sure, so why not white hat that shit, put it in a state wallet software can pull the list, and then flat out refuse to let the user import such a private key?
At least that way, we could start to rule out all of the KNOWN insecure wallets.

That's my thinking as well. It's entirely possible to buy things on Amazon with bitcoin now through various means if you REALLY need to, but I'd rather support people who are actively helping the ecosystem in meaningful ways.

I doubt it will amount to very much, at least in the short term. Consider just how many things have to come together to get it to work: Apple account, connected merchant account, NFC device on merchant side, NFC device on buyer side, willingness to use both, existing habit of using real-world wallet and card, and myriad issues of trust. Google Wallet is still pretty much unused, and I don't see this as a game changer. Bitcoin, meanwhile, just requires a tablet and a QR code on the merchant side, and any smartphone on the buyer's.
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:40:08
Are you new to bitcoins or something? This is not news, and it's also really misleading. That "inflation" is part of the mining reward, which is slowly releasing the total amount of BTC onto the market. Bitcoin is not truly inflationary, at least in the sense you mean, because there is a hard, programmed limit in the total number of BTC there will ever be: 21 million.
Just because all of those bitcoin aren't available yet doesn't mean the it's an inflationary system. A real inflationary system can inflate forever, as dictated by a central authority.
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:56:08
I'm holding, but without a fragment of hope that these shares are worth anything. The slim chance that someone might buy Neo from Danny and resurrect the company, absurd as that is, is still a better bet than selling what I own for 10% of what I paid.

The overall trend has been building for about a month. Today's catalyst seems to be that the Bitcoin Investment Trust bought up about 7,000 coins last night ($2.8 million or so) at the same time that 20x leverage appeared on the Asian exchanges. Not a lot of coins on the market and a bunch of people betting that the price will rise like it did last November means that those coins will rise.
That said, the reason we had such an absurd a rally last year was mostly that Mt.Gox was secretly insolvent and regularly breaking, so there was no actual liquidity. I doubt we'll see that size of a rally this time, although I wouldn't complain if it happened.
There's also a growing sense in the financial press that bitcoin is the next big thing, and while the really big players are probably months or years from getting in for legal and logistical reasons, a lot of smaller traders are dipping their toes in now that the price is on the rise.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:18:54
When the Dorian Nakamoto story broke, he posted this. Or someone using his account did. The Bitcoin world got very excited about it for a few days, and it was all over for a while.

I agree, but as I understand it, there's also no way to stop people from using SHA-256 to generate brainwallets. There are also plenty of services providing brainwallets, and those aren't going anywhere anytime soon. In that case, having a list of very likely things people might make brainwallets out of (as dumb as that is, we ALL agree), seems pretty simple. It wouldn't need to exclude every possible thing to be useful, just the most common things people like my mom would try to use when setting up a wallet. I'd bet a simply ruling out the top 1,000 popular quotes (and variations) would halt thousands of dollars of theft.

I was one of those who took a hit on NEOBEE, but I don't see it as having a huge impact. It's not like Mt.Gox/IRS/China in that the only people who lost money on it were investors who knew it was a risk. That's a fairly small population.
Outside of that group, the only people who really even knew about Neo &amp; Bee were folks in Cyprus. And even they didn't lose anything, because Neo didn't actually open accounts.
I imagine it's kind of like someone opening a gourmet dog food store, and telling everyone that they're just waiting for their special supplies to come in before they can start taking orders. They advertise like crazy, and for a while everyone is really curious if this gourmet dog food thing could really work. Then, a month later, they go out of business without ever having sold anything. Most people will shrug and say "It was a stupid idea, not surprised it failed." But apart from the staff and the landlord, and maybe the people who ran the ads, no one actually lost anything. It'll be forgotten pretty quickly.

I get that you find tips to be annoying. You may also find downvotes and shadowbans annoying. You might find all of those things unproductive or pointless to your personal vision of what Reddit is. You're fully entitled to your opinion.
That said, I certainly don't see tipping as spam. I see it as tipping. I tip people in the real world, I also tip them in the digital one. My jimmies have never been rustled by seeing a ChangeTip bot reply. If someone wants to send someone else a fraction of a penny, like people on do all the time, it's really not any of my business. If it shows up in another subreddit, I can't say I've ever noticed or cared. There are plenty of annoying bots on Reddit, but one where someone is literally giving someone else money for contributing (hopefully) quality content isn't one I'm going to complain about.
I'm certainly not going to insist that tips under an arbitrary threshold be banned to discourage people from showing a dime's worth of appreciation to another redditor.

There are plenty of helpful people, don't get me wrong, but there are just as many pissy, elitist pedants who want to show off what they know. I'm even being corrected on how to read a sidebar here. Step back and look at that for a minute, and I think you'll see what I'm talking about.

I'm no lawyer, but I'm assuming that even if the court agreed with you the most they'd award you in damages would be the value of the dirt bike, in USD, at the time the deal was made. That's all the value you technically "lost." If you said you were owed the price of a brand new dirt bike at current showroom prices, I doubt a court would see it that way, because that wasn't reflective of the deal made at the time. Again, I'm not saying there should be no damages, I'm just trying to wrap my head around what those damages could realistically be.

Fail outright? There aren't many realistic ways that could happen. But not-failing isn't the same thing as succeeding. There's no guarantee that bitcoin will become a universal currency, go up in value, be adopted widely or have any kind of longevity. There are nearly infinite ways it could fail in that sense, from all of the world's major economic bodies banning it to simply not gaining traction and becoming another failed electronic cash system.
That said, bitcoin has the best chance I've seen of making a lasting difference. Even if, for whatever reason, it did fail, the knowledge that it's possible to have trustless electronic transactions isn't going away. It will change how we deal with money, and it's already doing so on a scale very few people could have anticipated. So, in that sense, it's already a success.

What I'm saying is that it's meaningful that bitcoin is worth anything at all, particularly in that timeframe. Yes, people will buy stuff that has little to now value. That said, that bitcoin has gone from the value of a few electrons in some dudes C++ code to a worldwide currency currently worth 450 times the value of the system used by the biggest military force on the planet is remarkable. Even if it was five times that value, it's remarkable.
It's a huge thing, regardless of what the current trade value is, because in just a few short years people are valuing an idea and some software more than they're valuing the money of a country that could literally nuke them into glass.
If bitcoin crashed tomorrow to $5, yes, it would be awful in most ways for most people. But that would also mean that it is still worth MORE, simply as a concept, than the dollar to the people who understand it.

Why would that drive them to bitcoin? No one really accepts bitcoin at the moment. Most people don't understand it. They will, but at the moment that infrastructure just doesn't exist.
Let's say that tomorrow the U.S. declared it was bankrupt. The USD fell 90%, and all the merchants everywhere in the country and online instantly revised their prices. BTC is now $4,500. 
What's the average person's incentive to use BTC over the now-crashed dollar? That the dollar might crash again and bitcoin won't? They still can't buy anything with it, nor can they buy it easily even if they decided to take the leap.
Would more people be interested in bitcoin? Sure. Would there be more discussions about alternatives? Sure. Bitcoin would probably be one idea, but so would things like returning to the gold standard. But I highly doubt they'd flood into bitcoin specifically, because it's not actually a solution to their problem.

Devalue by 25% against what? All of the other currencies are valued against the dollar. Let's frame this another way:
If Americans woke up tomorrow and everything cost 25% more, would they flood into bitcoin?
No. It wouldn't even occur to them, and since bitcoin is also valued against the dollar, it would only look more expensive. Those of us who invested in bitcoin could be smug for a couple of days, though.

Agreed, at least on a personal level. But I'm operating on the assumption that most people will be more interested in simplicity than in security.

I just signed up and got approved for the beta and everything. It's something of a ghost town, content-wise, but as a proof-of-concept it's definitely interesting. In essence, you make a micropayment (I did mine from my ChangeTip address) for access to a video, and then you appear to have access to the video from that point on, rather than paying per view. The front end needs a lot of work, but as a demo for the idea it's decent enough.
I'm not able to do any uploading or testing beyond viewing videos, however, so it's pretty clearly in a very early development stage.

The idea that Nick Szabo is Satoshi has been kicked around almost from the start of bitcoin. It's likely he's Satoshi, but there's no definitive proof connecting the two that I've ever seen.

I don't think it preloads the card, as you project in step 3. As I understand it, it's linked to the Xapo-hosted hotwallet. In that case, it's a standard hosted wallet you could use for any bitcoin-related purchase, but with this additional option to sell bitcoin for fiat on the fly, with the entire transaction handled by Xapo. In that sense, Xapo is really buying whatever it is, and then deducting the BTC equivalent (plus fees, I'd guess) from the balance of your wallet.

My suspicion is that there are few surprises in the final BitLicense rules. But once the rules -- any rules that don't outlaw bitcoin outright, really -- are in place, we'll start seeing bigger chunks of cash come in. Right now, a lot of institutional money is at least curious about bitcoin, but can't invest in it until there is some framework in place.
If the BitLicense more-or-less works, a crush of businesses will be applying to get that business. We'll see a run up that makes today look like a sneeze.

That's the kind of feedback I was looking for. Thanks for listening.
So, all I'd really need to do is find/build a rainbow table that does the exact same thing, then make sure it exports publicly and has some way for a wallet provider to run a check against that list? That way, when you're importing a wallet generated from an obviously bad phrase (or even checking an address against blockchain.info) there could be a warning that says "This address is insecure, please generate a new one" or something along those lines.
I'm thinking of something like PeerBlock's list or something. There would need to be a way for users to add (or at least suggest) horrible keys.

Let's say that there was a supremely predatory bitcoin ATM in London, and it charged an eye-popping 10% to withdraw in local currency at the current exchange rate. £20 would be a £2 fee, rather than a £6 one. He's saved 20% over his bank fees. Those bank fees are high for understandable reasons, perhaps, but the problems those fees are paying to solve simply don't exist in the bitcoin model.
This bitcoin ATM could be relatively slow -- 10 minutes or so to confirm, let's say -- but that's a relatively minor issue. It's also a problem that's likely to go away as third-party bitcoin wallet services (with their own fees, I'm sure) move into the ecosystem. If it was similar to Coinbase, for instance, the transaction could happen as fast as a standard ATM withdrawal. Coinbase fees are minimal, even for a direct wire transfer to a bank account.
The more likely long-term scenario is that the ATM would charge far less than 10%, and certainly less than the 30% charged by the bank in the situation above. It's entirely possible for an a bitcoin ATM to be profitable and instantaneous charging around 2%.

The context you're missing is the huge price drop that occurred after the Feds announced the date of the auction. That happened around June 12, and the price didn't recover until just before the auction. I expect this time will be less dramatic, but it's still downward pressure. The price dropped enough yesterday for me to feel I made the right call selling 20% before the news got around.

As much as I like the words coming out of the Winklevii's mouths, I think they're overstating things tremendously. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see a $32,000 bitcoin for utterly greedy reasons, but I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.
Bitcoin could, in its current form with relatively little additional investment, put Western Union out of business. I think that's a fairly safe statement to make, and I suspect we'll probably see a bitcoin-using rival to WU rise pretty soon.
But Visa and Mastercard? Sorry, no dice. Not for the better part of a decade, at least. They have infrastructure, marketing, regulation, bank integration and near-universal merchant acceptance.
I'm not saying I wouldn't like to see it, or that it won't eventually happen, but it's much more likely that Visa and Mastercard will just co-opt bitcoin's innovations by then.

Consider this: Google brought them to those forums in the first place. Additionally, there are no right answers on many of these questions, just opinions and ever-changing assessments.
When I started looking into bitcoin, Mt.Gox was a thing and people pissed all over Coinbase because it was slow and the prices were lower. MultiBit was highly recommended only a few weeks ago, and now it looks like it might actually be kind of buggy. There are countless examples.
Ask a perfectly reasonable, if uninformed, question on a bitcoin forum and you'll instantly be dogpiled by people desperate to show off how much more they know than you do. I'm an old hand at the internet, so I can filter the trolling easily enough, but for an average person it's an incredibly hostile environment.
Yes, people should do their own research and make their own decisions. But that they get treated harshly when they go to a user forum -- a place dedicated to talking about the topic -- and get 133t-jizz all over their face simply for asking the same questions everyone asked at some point, that's elitism at work.

I think "debunked" is a little strong. There is one specific case, as you describe, where they might have incorrect assumptions. But there's no reason to think that this actually is the case.

Maybe. What law would apply, though? There are no laws protecting BTC transactions. If you trade a stock, and then the price of stock you traded skyrockets, it's not like you get to take the other party to court. You just lost a bet. Same here, I would think. There was no guarantee that bitcoin would rise, or that BL wouldn't lose money by accepting bitcoin payments.
The court is unlikely to recognize BTC as having some special status, and the price of BTC itself is not something BL can control. I could see the court saying there was a dollar amount, sure, but the IRS rules would hint to me that it's only the cash value at the time of purchase that would have any relevant value. 
If someone paid in gold, I don't see the court saying they'd be entitled to the same amount of gold back. They were buying an item with a dollar value, right? So any damages would be in dollars, I'd think.

I think there are some parallels, definitely. I don't think it's all that similar in a practical sense, because most people's lives wouldn't be meaningfully different if everyone started using bitcoin tomorrow. I don't see bitcoin being a frontline technology in the way HTML is, for instance.
It's more that bitcoin solves a lot of problems people generally don't think about, even though it's clearly better than the current solutions. Since most of those problems involve money and security, it has enormous potential to make a lot of people very wealthy helping companies that rely on securely dealing with money. But I doubt most people will see bitcoin's innovations first hand, or care very much even if they do. For most people, bitcoin won't be much other than something that works kind of like a mashup of PayPal and a pre-paid debit card you can use from your phone.
I suspect the real impact of bitcoin will be in banking and finance, where those tiny 2% margins are enough to shoot a stock price through the roof. In that way, I think the effect will probably more similar to what cell-phones and internet use did to landlines and cable TV. A perfectly functional, if somewhat expensive and outdated system, was slowly replaced by a more efficient one. Practically no one under 40 has a home phone, but if they do it's actually an internet connection pretending to be a phone line, and cable TV is basically just a special kind of internet connection. In both cases, the transition was "the internet," but not in the way most people generally mean it.
Both of those transitions only happened only after the mainstream companies realized how much more profitable the new system was than the old one. All of those crazy cell-phone startups got eaten by traditional business interests. (Nextel, anyone?) Cell-phones and new cable infrastructure made a lot of people very rich and completely change the world, but it's not something my grandma has to have a political ideology to understand.

Short answer: Yes, it's crashing. Probably crashing for a few more days, and likely for another few weeks, and maybe even months. It's unfortunate, but it's not the end of the world.
A more nuanced view is that there some very big forces pressing down on bitcoin buying right now, and there are plenty of people who are willing to sell. The IRS thing is scary to people who have never dealt with capital gains, the China thing is scary because it's flooding the market with coins. I suspect that there are also some people gaming the system to make the price fall so they can get cheap coins over the next few weeks and months.
Why? Because the IRS essentially made bitcoin legitimate, and SecondMarket (and the other funds) will make it a massive investment opportunity later this year. The total that China removed from the market will be a fraction of what Wall St. will add in once the ecosystem is a little more developed. That IRS capital gains decision was an open invitation to Wall St.
Every day, Coinbase and Bitpay are talking to merchants, and giving them a nearly zero-risk way to try bitcoin. Every day, the guys from SecondMarket are talking to people who could singlehandedly drive the price up to $1,000 again with a normal (for them) sized investment. Every day, bitcoin ATMs are shipping from Robocoin and Lamassu. I'm not being a booster here, this is exactly what's going on right now.
So, yes there is a crash at the moment. We may see $300. We may even see $100, although I very much tend to doubt it. But I doubt it will last beyond summer.
That said, if you need to sell, do what's right for you. I suggest you hold on to a little, because there is every reason to believe that we're still at the start of the bitcoin story. We're at the point where almost everyone (including the people who hate it) agrees it's a genius technology, and the biggest challenge is making it friendly for the masses.
Should you be scared? If you need to pay rent with your bitcoin, yes. Short term, it sucks. But if you're worried about the long term side, chillax. There are no guarantees, but there are a lot of VERY rich people banking on bitcoin still being around at the end of summer. You can bet they'll do everything they can to make sure the value rises to at least the former high of $1,200, and probably much, much more.

I suspect we'll see almost every industry that handles the exchange of currency experimenting with bitcoin in the next few years. Most of the advantages the bitcoin community crow about apply just as much to big corporations as they do to regular people. Once there are some proven payment processors in place, and the security is at least as reliable as the existing system, we'll start seeing some public moves.
Just as much of this adoption, however, will be in things we don't see. Western Union could hire a firm to build its own pre-mined, zero-fee blockchain for its own offices, and distribute nodes around the globe for very little money. So could Visa, MasterCard, Discover, BofA ... you name it. They could build the concepts of bitcoin into their own systems in ways that will be totally invisible to the average user, and simply profit from the savings. Bitcoin will "win" in that sense, but the average consumer won't.
It's really not that far off from what happened with the internet. People were talking about digital music distribution in the mid-1990s, and it was fairly obvious that most media was going to be available in some form digitally for a fraction of the then-current costs. It took a service like iTunes, however, for the music industry to even consider playing ball with the innovation. Now, very few people buy CDs, and the entire industry depends on digital sales.
By guess is that it'll be the same thing with bitcoin. Everyone will be skeptical until the framework is in place for everyone involved to see the benefits.

The IRS is under no real obligation to change their position, even if some random country -- or a bunch of them -- officially adopted bitcoin as legal tender. It's just a semantic game to allow them to tax it in the way that they believe makes the most sense given what bitcoin is. From the government's perspective, it will never be a currency because there's no state bank controlling it. It doesn't work like a currency on the macro level. It also doesn't really work like a property, but it's closer than it is to currency.
That said, I suspect the current rules are really just placeholders until Congress decides to create some kind of actual laws for regulating virtual currencies. The IRS doesn't make laws, so they're kind of stuck sticking bitcoin in one ill-fitting category or another.
I know that people are freaking out about the capital gains stuff, but having bitcoin treated as a currency would cause just as many problems, they'd just be different. The important thing is that there's legal recognition at all.

It's not like it will be 10 to 30 minutes forever. It's that way right now because there is no infrastructure and no third-party system acting as a processor. But look at what Xapo is doing with their new MasterCard system, and you'll see that this is likely to be a non-issue in the long run. The next generation of bitcoin ATMs will work more-or-less like standard ATMs, only with considerably less friction.
Even with a 30 minute wait, that's still better than losing massive amounts of cash to bank fees.

I'm guessing that their banks would probably tell them if they had to close their accounts. It's 1:30 p.m. in Beijing right now, and with 15 exchanges supposedly impacted by this, each with at least one Chinese bank account (why name them otherwise?), surely someone would be complaining. Given that this sounds identical to the last thing the PBoC said wasn't true from Sina, I think some skepticism is called for.

A lot of people are worried about the tax thing, but I really don't think it will amount to much. Given that every address, amount and transaction is on the blockchain, and that there's price data for every second of the day, coding a "here's every capital gain from this year, and the taxable amount in USD" should be something every wallet, online and off, can offer in a week or two. Even Blockchain.info could implement it for every public address they track. Should be a simple little script, I'd think.
As far as the general question: I'd buy coffee every day with bitcoin if there was a place that took it around here.

You're right. Bitcoin ATMs will never work.
The ATM industry didn't just release a major report about bitcoin adoption a few months ago, and they're totally not looking into it as a way to prop up their declining services in an era POS debit card systems. There aren't tens of millions of dollars being spent on this right now, working out these problems. BitPay and Coinbase specifically aren't in the process of working out these systems. Lamassu and Robocoin are doomed. Bitcoin could never compete against a 30% conversion fee using a system specifically designed to remove friction from the internet transaction process. No one, anywhere, would ever see money to be made from offering an escrow service at a small fee for instant ATM withdrawals. It's impossible.
No one is doing anything to address the insurmountable problems you so eloquently outline. It's a fairy tale. In the real world, bitcoin will never work.
The only way money can ever, ever move in a timely manner from an online account to a machine that spits out paper is through plastic cards with magnetic strips on them.

I realized bitcoin was something worth putting some money into in late 2012, when I was working on a freelance marketing piece about it for a client. A few things vaguely like bitcoin have come and gone in the last 20 years, and they've all failed for various reasons. Most of the time, it was because the people/companies behind them either gave up, were sued into obliteration, or were bought out.
What caught my attention was how difficult it would be for bitcoin to fail, since literally everyone in the network would have to stop using it for it to die. Prices could rise and fall, countries could ban it or block bitcoin traffic, but the network as a whole really can't be stopped.
Here's this thing that actually could put some real pressure on the overtly rigged money game, and there's no way to kill it. Which means that after a few years of very bad noise, anger, spitting and fury, the only option left will be for the major players to co-opt it. And when that happens, they'll all be fighting for a bigger piece of it.
So I bought in. Bitcoin is worth way more now. I see no reason to think it will be worth any less over the long term, and a lot of reasons to think it will be worth more. I strongly suspect that in 10 years, everyone will be using bitcoin in some way, even if they don't realize it. It'll be part of the banking system, handling money transfers between banks, running debit-card transactions and verifying POS purchases.

You're not asking for ChangeTip to change its bot to be less intrusive, you're asking for a ban on tips below an arbitrary price point. That's two completely different things. 
Like I said, it's perfectly possible to hire someone to build a browser plugin that blocks ChangeTip posts from displaying. Or to talk to ChangeTip and/or the Reddit devs to see if there's a less obtrusive way to send and receive tips. Those are all solutions I think you'd find broad support for.
Trying to prevent people from sending each other tips in the amount they prefer for content they like isn't something I'd support. I get it, you don't like to see tipping. Other people do like it. The solution isn't for everyone else to stop doing something they enjoy, even if it does promote a service. The solution is for you to find a way to customize your online experience without ruining everyone else's fun.

Much has been written about this topic. Spend some time on Google if you're worried about the odds of SHA256 getting cracked. Even of that algorithm does somehow become compromised, however, it would mostly mean that bitcoin would need to fork to a new, more secure one, not that the bitcoin network itself would be in much danger. A pain for ASIC-based miners, sure, but by no means the end of the experiment.

It's worth noting that Buffett, for all his many good qualities as a smart investor, is also amazingly wrong sometimes. He lost nearly $2 billion last year on a hunch about Energy Future Holdings. That's more than a third of the total bitcoin market cap, all on one dumb bet.
He's made his fortune investing in surefire long-term winners, and ONLY surefire winners. He has also been extremely wrong, although less than he's been right. He doesn't even think Microsoft, Apple, Facebook or Google are surefire winners. And, from his perspective, bitcoin is WAY more risky than those. It doesn't follow the rules he uses to make his money, so of course it's a "mirage" in his eyes.
He's not looking at stock prices, he's looking at profits. Bitcoin is exactly what he says it is -- it's a fancy money order, just like cash, which he also doesn't really care for -- and while it might make a lot of people very wealthy, it's also completely subject to the whims of the world market, which, say, GEICO isn't. You have to have car insurance by law, so there will always be a demand for it as long as there are cars. From his perspective, bitcoin is an awful investment because the only thing it does is move money around slightly better than the current way.
I think he's missing the point, but he's not wrong when you see it from his perspective.

Demand is lower than supply. 
More specificallly: Chinese demand is down, and probably will be until at least April 15 when the People's Bank of China's bitcoin policies are finally known. Even then, it's probably not coming back anywhere near as strong. Here in the U.S., the IRS made mining taxable, so miners are selling to pay their taxes before April 15 as well. The momentum buyers have lost interest and are cutting their losses until there's a new upswing.
Most of us who aren't selling are waiting until Q3 when the U.S. exchanges markets come online. Before then, I expect little more than a holding pattern.

3. Historical rally. The price went up last November, and a lot of people are hoping for a repeat.
4. Lots of positive bitcoin press in the financial industry following Money 20/20.
5. Black Friday. I remain unconvinced, but it's as plausible as other reasons.

My suggestion is that you buy a small amount. Like, the smallest amount you can afford to risk. My first buy was $15. Even at today's prices, it's a HUGE win. I've never regretted it, because on some level I know that my loss was on par with going out to a movie that I didn't like.
I fully expect that a $15 investment today will be worth $150 by the end of this year, if not more. If you can afford a little more, cool. That's not me saying "$1,000 will be worth $10K! BUY BUY BUY!" that's me saying "$15 now could plausibly buy a really great weekend next year." If it doesn't, you'll probably still be able to eat at Taco Bell with what's left.

No worries, man. It's the internet and bitcoin. Collisions happen.


It was in the example I was responding to. If bitcoin crashed to $5 ...


But the sum value of all bitcoins isn't reflected by the market cap. The cap reflects that the most recent price for bitcoin, which could (in principle) simply be one transaction. Multiplying that by the total number of bitcoins gives you the market cap, but it doesn't represent what MOST people paid for those coins.
So, if I'm buying a cup of coffee for bitcoin, the market cap means nothing. I want to know what my bitcoin is worth relative to the dollar. The market cap isn't going to help me measure that. The USD/BTC rate is the only thing that matters, and the only thing I'm making my judgment on.
My larger point is that it's astounding that bitcoin has any value at all on this timescale. That I can buy coffee with what is essentially an idea, and that people value the whole unit marker of that idea several hundred times more than the dollar is incredible. Yes, in a mathematical sense the placement of a decimal point for where a "bitcoin" starts doesn't matter that much. But bitcoin the whole unit started WAY under $1, and WAY WAY under $10, and WAY WAY WAY under $450. In that sense, it matters a lot.

Here's another scenario: A very thinly veiled cabal of people, possibly working for one well-known, notoriously trollish entity with a directly competing business interest to Neo &amp; Bee has been pulling sloppy versions of every well-known stock price manipulation tactic in the book for two solid weeks now. The sole extent of actual evidence is that Neo &amp; Bee has been quiet and running with a skeleton crew for two weeks during a major bitcoin price drop, exactly the time when a reasonably smart new business would lie fallow and focus on raising new funds for a Q3 expansion timed with the almost-certain boom caused by Wall St.'s entrance to the bitcoin market.
That same shadowy group of people appears to have tried to drive the NEOBEE price down on Havelock in one of the most ham-handed attempts at stock manipulation ever seen. They've posted countless amounts of FUD on Reddit and Bitcointalk to do the same. It's a cheap way to get uninformed people to panic sell.
Why? Because there's every reason to believe that Neo &amp; Bee is actually a very good long-term bet, and they want all of the shares they can get before Q2 reports start to show new European investment.
Not only that, but literally EVERYONE who puts in 20 minutes of looking knows exactly who is behind this. I'm not saying it won't work -- people are scared, and you'll pick up a few cheap shares -- but if you've been around the block a few times, you know exactly what kind of bullshit this is.

I'm not sure what point you're making here. The PBoC made an official statement saying "We're not banning bitcoin or halting transactions." This report is saying that they're banning bitcoin from the entire financial system, and at least two exchanges are saying it's not true. No one seems to be crying foul about their accounts being closed. One story in one online publication says something, possibly just to drive traffic. If it changes and I'm wrong, you have my apologies, but there's PLENTY of reason to be skeptical here.

I agree that it's great to use secure methods. This concept would essentially be exactly what you propose. It tests the private key against the top, say, 10,000 most likely things someone would make a brain wallet out of. Or maybe 10,000,000 if there's an easy way to generate that. It would be something any wallet provider could pull from, just like the blockchain or one of the USD/BTC price charts. A full list would be available and searchable.
I don't think it would be that expensive or difficult to create. If the wallet providers could be brought in, they may already have some resources for this kind of thing.

This is as short as I can go while providing an actual answer.
Bitcoin the network: It's a digital account ledger with tens of thousands of copies being constantly checked against each other to ensure that the tallies are correct. As an incentive for keeping this network running and confirming any transactions, "miners" are randomly rewarded with additional units of currency by the system.
Bitcoin the currency: The units measured by the public ledger. There is a hard limit to the total number of whole units, but are each easily divisible to millions of decimal units. Because the network is distributed and operates on the assumption that no party is to be trusted without cryptographic verification, it is functionally impossible to counterfeit bitcoin, and equally impossible to seize or steal bitcoin without assess to the private account address.

A lot of this price movement seems to relate to the Bitcoin Investment Trust soaking up around 7,000 BTC last night.

The BitLicense rules will make it a lot safer for investors, and I'd bet that the rally they're start will last well into next year. I don't know that it will be a steep rally, but the financial press is increasingly bullish on bitcoin.
I'm sure there are individuals buying up coins for Black Friday, but not on the scale that would move the price up like we're seeing today.
Will there be a crash after Black Friday? Maybe, but we've also seen huge price crashes for absolutely no obvious reason in the last year, and rallies on bad news. So it's not a given.

I don't get that impression at all. I get the sense that they are relentless self-promoters with a dubious product. My understanding of their wallet system is that it doesn't even give you access to your own private keys. That's a huge red flag, as is this 0.13 BTC in fees. I have yet to see any reason to trust them to hold my bitcoin for any reason.

Because the source of the leak isn't Coinbase, it's extracted from the Mt.Gox database that was stolen last month. The scammer is almost certainly using a quirk on Coinbase's system that allows you to ID a user by their email address. By running the list of Mt.Gox emails against Coinbase, you can generate a small list of confirmed Coinbase users. That's exactly what we're seeing here. There's no doubt that bitcoin's user base is heavily male, but this leaked document isn't a general data set. It's people who had both Mt.Gox AND Coinbase accounts.

I'm not one of the goxxed, but there may be reason to hope. There's been a post on for a few days now talking about this story, which claims 530,000 BTC have moved around from Mt.Gox related addresses:

The public key is your email address. You send things from it, and receive things to it. To actually access the email account, however, you need the username/password combination.
(That's not what's going on at the technical level of email, obviously, but most people have used Gmail and will understand the concept.)

Trading has been halted for a few days while NEOBEE investigates. Making everyone panic between now and when trading resumes so that everyone sells out of fear, uncertainty and doubt is a great way to make sure that the price drops. I have concerns too, but don't mistake what's happening here for anything REAL, it's just people trying to game a stock price.

Keep in mind that someone out there is still offloading 650,000 BTC stolen from Mt. Gox. They're likely unloading it in blocks to keep the price from crashing outright, and this means that the price is going to keep going down until they've cashed out. Something like $306,900,000 (current prices) would have to come into the entire bitcoin system before they're tapped out and the price stops having such huge downward pressure. That could take years, but assuming bitcoin is still the top dog when it does happen, the price will very quickly grow.

I suspect we'll see non-bank ATM companies implement this feature pretty soon. There was an ATM manufacturer industry report a few months ago that was VERY positive about bitcoin as a new revenue stream, as ATMs themselves are in steep decline thanks to point-of-sale systems, debit cards and other mobile pay systems.
That said, the banks themselves have no incentive to work with bitcoin directly. I don't think they're worried about the competition or anything, it's more that it's a totally different business. They aren't even all that involved on the ATM part of the transaction, and they only offer debit cards because a third-party system handles all of it for them.
My guess is that when Coinbase or BitPay get big enough, and the infrastructure is put together in a few years, you'll be able to withdraw bitcoin in fiat right from an standard ATM. There's just a lot of details to be worked out, and bitcoin has to grow MASSIVELY in value for it to be worth the effort for the monetary networks to even bother. By that point, Visa and MasterCard (and Google, Amazon, WalMart ...) will already own stakes, either directly or indirectly, in bitcoin. (Or they'll be pushing their own versions of it.)

Nah, that's not my experience at all. If you ask around, you'll find that most people are neutral at worst towards tipping. Plenty of people find it fun, weird, goofy and thought-provoking, and not just on the crypto subreddits. I've only encountered a handful of people of the opinion that tipping is spam and completely unwelcome. You're clearly of that view, but it is by no means the general opinion.
If individual subreddits want to ban tipping, more power to them. If individual users want to block tips or take steps to avoid seeing them, they should. If Reddit wants to write a option in the user preferences to allow people to avoid seeing tips in the same way they block low-rated posts, I'm all for it.
But I'm totally against setting some arbitrary limit on what can be tipped because some people don't like seeing it. I don't like seeing posts by people with dumb user names, but I'm not suggesting that Reddit block those.

I'll believe it when I see it, of course, but it's at least plausible. It would also likely mean that Mt.Gox really was keeping their funds in cold storage, and just fucked something up that locked them out. It's very easy to see why they were so cagey in January and February, and why they filed for bankruptcy protection until they could sort it out.

Out of curiosity, how exactly are they thinking damages would work here? At best, it seems like people who didn't get their equipment on time could only claim to have "lost" the money they spent on a machine they don't want anymore, or maybe the price in BTC if that's how they paid.
Beyond that, I don't see what damages a court could award, even if they agreed with the plaintiffs.
If BL delivered a product, even super-late, there's not a good case for fraud. What was "lost" in terms of potential profits never actually belonged to the miners in the first place, they just lost the opportunity to compete for it. The hashrate is completely outside of BL control, and it's grown way faster than even many people in the bitcoin world anticipated, so it would be difficult to argue that they weren't acting in good faith. I just don't see what damages there are to be had beyond a USD refund.
Not trolling or trying to rustle jimmies, just trying to understand what I'm missing.

Sure it should, at least in principle. That said, as a casual user of the service who rarely has more than $10 in my wallet at any one time, it's also a fairly small issue for me. If we're going to pressure anyone for a proof-of-reserve, let's pressure Coinbase and BitPay.

Glad I could give you another perspective. The trick, at least for me, has been to look at as big of a picture as I can and say "How much does this seem like it's worth TO ME?" When I bought in, bitcoin was $70. I figured at the time it was worth at least $300, so it made sense. It took six months for that instinct to actually be validated, and in the interim I didn't pay attention to anything other than checking in on the price from time to time.
Right now, given the current level of development and investment, I suspect bitcoin is probably "really" worth at least few thousand bucks. I also suspect that by the time Wall St. gets in, there will be a HUGE bubble for a year or two, followed by a HUGE crash because I honestly doubt the needed infrastructure for mainstream adoption will be in place by then.
For me, it makes sense to buy a little more, and to get out in stages as the price goes nuts. That's what's right FOR ME, RIGHT NOW. But that doesn't mean it's right for everyone. My guesses and assumptions are just that, and I could totally be proven wrong.
What I'm getting at here boils down to this one, unasked for piece of advice: Do what makes sense for you, and don't risk more than you can afford to lose.

This sounds extremely plausible to me. Karpeles seems to think that Mt.Gox can be saved, somehow. I highly doubt it's possible, but I could see why he'd go that route.

Don't forget the Mt.Gox hackers. Liquidating 650,000 BTC takes a long, long time to do if you don't want to crash the price in the process.

That's a good point. Do you know of any reliable sources for how many coins have actually been bought since November 2013?
I'm well aware of $500ish million being a humble number on the global scale. I've lived in places where there have been multi-billion dollar investments happening in a single city, and many of which would be irrelevant outside the region, let alone the country. It's more a matter of understanding the scale of bitcoin's growth since the last big price bubble. 
My point, to the extent that I have one, is that there seems to be an awful lot of money flowing into bitcoin even as the price itself drops. Even if it was just a few hundred million, on par with the VC investments over the last year, it's still substantial.
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:46:49
Not to be contrary, but isn't this something that could be automated VERY easily? We have the timestamps and transactions in the blockchain, we have the price averages, we have computers. Running a calculation of how many coins changes hands at what value from an account that received coins at a different value shouldn't be particularly hard to code.
It's a pain in the ass to do it once a year, I guess, but so are taxes in general. And it's not like they have to break out a sliderule or something, this is free-app level programming complexity. Even for a VERY active merchant, as long as they know their public addresses there's really no reason it can't be a one-click "here's what you owe" calculation.
In theory, it SHOULD take a fraction of normal accounting time.

It has nothing to do with that article. The entire global stock market is crashing, as is the oil market. What you're seeing is people who are losing their shirts elsewhere cashing out their BTC. It has zero to do with bitcoin itself, it's just investors trying to cut their riskiest investments.

From what I gather -- and I'm admittedly a n00b on blockchain stuff, and I can't read the Japanese text in the photo -- these numbers may not actually represent actual coins moving. They may well represent a total volume of coins that Coinsight observed Mt.Gox moving around before their API access was turned off. Then again, it's possible it means that there are 530,000 BTC in Mt.Gox's accounts. Someone who knows what they're doing could check it pretty easily, I'm sure. I'm just not that guy.
EDIT: It's also worth noting that Gox's announcement about finding the 200,000 BTC on the 20th hinted strongly that they could be amending the total number of coins found. That might have just been standard legalese, but there's no reason to think they'd ever adjust it down. "Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation." 
They either have the coins or they don't, so they may have been planning to eventually announce newly found coins.
