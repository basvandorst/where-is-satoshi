I was talking to someone who works in this (emerging) area, but not at one of those companies who develop the tools, and he sounded pretty convinced about the inadequacy of tumblers.
As far as exchanges go, yes, even BTC-e has been known to hold stolen coins, but with decentralized (BTC-ALT) exchanges this will not be achievable.

I have a faint memory of a BitGo page coming up on Finex where you had the option to agree. Otherwise your account got frozen and you had to withdraw everything, or the like, I really don't remember the details. If I'm not mistaken this also means that new customers (since then) were automatically using the BitGone "solution".
Someone else might chip in with a screenshots and/or confirmation/denial.

@_date: 2016-08-07 13:16:50
There are two roads still open. One is taking the haircut and possible bail-in or credit notes, the other inevitably leads to a Gox style liquidation **for the remainder of the decade**. Gox was a clear-cut case compared to this and after 3 years, plus tens of millions in expenses they are yet to see a dime.
The options are getting about ~2/3rds of your assets now, with the possibility of recovering the rest, or getting back less around 2020-2021. Even if you'd be sure to get a better deal with a liquidation, which I don't see happening, the time value on your money makes the Gox option unattractive.

Latest rumor is that BTC holders and USD lenders will be taking the hit and it will be much, much worse than 20%. Up to 60-70% range depending on how it works out. If the lent out USD was used to buy BTC on margin, then they can't go after the margin long position holder who got the coins stolen from under the position saying they have to pay up. They also can't claw back the money from a person who simply sold coins for USD before the hack. There are a ton of different scenarios because there are USD/BTC and several ALT/BTC pairs in question.
On the other hand, from what I've heard, they might be issued a freely traded shitcoin with 1 USD "nominal value" for every dollar lost, on which Finex will be making repayments over the years.
I was hit severely, but I'd rather take a bigger haircut now than a somewhat smaller one in 3-4 years, after a dozen court cases and after lawyers' fees, if the whole company gets liquidated.

Most tumblers are far less useful against the analytics tools that came online the past year than people would think.
The best way of masking the movement of value is to exchange them for coins which have anonymity features, but decentralized exchanges lack liquidity.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:43:50
It actually sounds like they are going with option A2. 
Altcoin holders and people simply sitting in USD (that wasn't lent out) are not rumored to get hit. On the other hand the BTC loss will be socialized among holders and longs, so it won't be a reverse lottery.

I don't see the "irony". Nobody even seriously considered a hard fork to return the coins and the matter is being resolved between the affected parties. Bitcoin continues to chug along just fine. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:59:00
Bfx was using BitGo so we had a sort of decentralized proof of reserves, therefore most of the coins were stolen from thousands of wallets, in many transactions, just at the same time.
Here are some of the transactions associated with the hack.

To be honest I can totally see their security page not having been updated from earlier this years when they introduced BitGone for everyone.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:31:24




There was no insurance. Nobody claimed to have insurance. Bitfinex outright denied having insurance months before the hack when asked. 
Bitgo only claimed to have insurance as an opt-in product, or at least that's how I interpret it. They are also denying any responsibility in this case anyway, which of course might get challenged legally depending on the details of the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:32:55
The BFX tokens are only IOUs at this point. They are yet to release their plans with it, and the option to exchange it to equity may not be available for all affected parties anyway due to legal issues.

They'll just sit on the coins until Bitcoin implements anonymity features or decentralized exchanges reach a point where they can exchange a significant amount for something anonymous.
Maybe if they really don't care about all of it they may cause some mayhem by transferring a fraction to random addresses, crowdsales and so forth.
@_date: 2016-04-08 13:16:44
The responses in the thread are generally accurate and pretty much cover the answer to your question. 
Exchanges such as Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Gemini, OkCoin, etc only facilitate trade, they are not really involved in trading. What's available to buy is not their own inventory; those are separate entities looking to sell.
To put it simply, imagine traditional marketplaces in several villages. Stretch your imagination and assume that the main product that's being bought and sold are uniform blue marbles. 
The exchanges are essentially the guys that permit you to set up stalls, and they collect fees in their own village marketplace after every marble that's bought and sold. Their job is to make sure the local marketplace operates smoothly, without disturbances, but they don't care that much about price and they don't trade regularly trade themselves. A well run marketplace will draw in more people, which leads to more trades, and more revenue.
Most of the stalls in the marketplaces are ran by speculators who try to make a profit by selling when they think the price will go down and buying when they think it's going to go up. (Buy low, sell high)
Now, imagine crowds of people suddenly appearing at a single marketplace (marketplace A), buying those blue marbles furiously. The stall owners, seeing this, will start marking up the price of the marbles and they (together with the local villagers) will also try to buy a lot of them before the mob can, with the goal of selling it to the crowd at a higher price. [A rally ensues, price skyrockets]
News spreads fast, other village marketplaces, like marketplace B, experience a similar rally. They speculate the the mob will appear at their place as well, but what's more, they can now buy at marketplace B and sell at marketplace A while making a profit. [Arbitrage]
Let's say the frenzied mob swarms all marketplaces where the marble is available and price really starts skyrocketing. Other people who don't keep track of the price take notice and they might want to jump on board and visit the markets to buy.  
More importantly, seeing this, a lot of people who hold marbles at their homes might decide that maybe it's a good idea to sell at least some of them. Sure, they look nice, but if they sell now they can turn a massive profit since they bought them cheaper. New supply keeps appearing as people visit the market to sell. Stall owners, who just earlier bought marbles to sell higher will also want to see profit and start selling some. Some of the mob will also see that their investment has multiplied in value and will try to realize those gains by selling.
If the mob suddenly realize that price has stopped increasing and it is in fact trickling down then the market can turn around and the same stampede can occur in the opposite direction.
I got carried away with the village example, but the main takeaway is that exchanges will never run out of bitcoins. There are a lot of independent market participants and someone will always have some to sell, and someone else will always be looking to buy some, the main question is just the price.
If you wanted to spend 10 billion dollars on bitcoin, you would be able to get 10 billion dollar's worth, but that's only because the price would be much, much higher than now.
I just want to add that right now exchange volumes are a bit muted due to this sideways drift we've been having for a while now. Volatility is **spectacularly low**.  
A lot of traders are expecting a big move soon (next week or the one after) in either direction. My guess is right now you would be able to buy a couple of thousand coins in one day, on multiple exchanges, without influencing price too much. More than that and you could trigger and the village market stampede scenario could play out with unpredictable consequences.

Volumes *are* manipulated.
I don't want to copy and paste but I commented on the same topic just hours ago in a different thread:
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:59:14
There has been a massive increase in actual volume the past 3-4 months, but since the end of 2018 a lot of previously unknown exchanges have emerged with *literally unbelievable* volumes. So now we have about 40-50 no-name, scammy Potemkin exchanges wash trading spectacular volumes in order to draw in people who don't know any better and to charge listing fees for altcoins. 
Coinbene, OEX, Bitforex and Lbank alone have over **160 billion dollars** worth of combined volume for the past 30 days but you can bet your hat that *at least* 95% if not 99% of that is fake. There are dozens of these exchanges. Compare that with the ~47 billion dollars worth of combined 30d volume of Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Coinbase and Kraken.
This has no effect on BTC/USD or BTC/EUR prices as few coins actually change hands in these operations; price wise they just follow more legit exchanges.

Some websites (I have not tested all wallets) do not give you the choice of adjusting fees, they just go by a default.  This might be an issue. Then again, they should, so this might make them introduce the option.

There is already a soft limit set by miners if they leave their settings on default. We are also unlikely to see actual 20MB blocks for the foreseeable future after this is implemented unless transactions explode.
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:04:06
Decreasing the average time between blocks would be nice. One minute, two minutes, 5 minutes, anything would be better. Even though it doesn't happen every day, having to wait an hour or more for a single confirmation is atrocious. I'm sure it happened to most people who use Bitcoin regularly.
Given, a single confirmation won't carry the strength of a current one, but increasing confirmation granularity is a great outcome.
I'm less enthusiastic about trying to somehow control block time on the fly in smaller time frame, like intraday. Sounds like there would be too many variables involved and it could possibly open up new avenues of attack for malevolent or even just selfish participants. 
Decreasing block time, combined with increasing block size while balancing tx/h, bandwidth and propagation issues would do the trick in my opinion. 
Even though the block size increase seems to be divisive enough by itself, and this carries the risk of introducing another point of argument with no full consensus behind it, I think it's still worth floating this. It's better to get over these changes in one package so users will only have to introduce major changes to their implementations once in the next 6 to 18 months or so.

Circle, Coinbase, ATMs. Localbitcoins now has volume in most countries that matter and there are now more local exchanges as well. 
There are also more people who know about BTC and how/where to buy it. The associated infrastructure is now much better. (Even if one wonders how the Bitcoin infrastructure itself would be able to handle 10 times the transaction volume.)
Due to media coverage, back in 2013 all people knew was Gox, even though other exchanges existed. It was MtGox this, MtGox that. If it's Bitcoin, you buy it on MtGox. It was a pain to get some cash into Gox to grab some coins. Compared to that we are light years ahead.

If you want to get fiat into the system through corporate channels then it's akin to opening a brokerage account. Although once you are in (or have BTC), it's a breeze, unless you want to trade on heavily regulated exchanges like Gemini/Coinbase.


I know we live in different countries, but in my experience it takes less than a day to buy BTC through localbitcoins. I could probably buy some within 2 hours, with a fresh account, without ID verification, and only a few % markup. It probably depends on the country, its regulatory environment and how paranoid the sellers are.
ATMs are also an option in some places, but there are many variables such as fees, limits and the like.
It doesn't say much to newcomers, but it's light years ahead compared to where we were in 2012-2013. (LBC was around, but liquidity was worse)
In any case, if you plan on trading BTC, it's a good idea to get some money into the ecosystem in advance. You can then let it sit in USD/EUR until you see an opportunity if you aren't keen on holding, and have the option of relatively safe US based exchanges if you don't mind the paperwork.

Socialized losses, in the sense used by certain (pseudo-) "futures" exchanges, only results in outstanding (/unfilled) liquidations getting picked up by people who made a profit at the end of settlement. Futures is a zero sum game. They can't exactly go after Johnny Shorter and take his house to cover the profit of the longs, therefore it's the winners who take home less profit at the end of the week.
In this particular case the liquidation was filled therefore this by itself won't cause any haircuts.

Yes. When I send 1 BTC from my Trezor to Mycelium on my phone it is processed as a transaction and recorded on the blockchain. A little green ball drops.
Then later I use that 1 BTC to buy something online, so I send it from my phone to whichever payment processor handles BTC for the business. Another transaction on the blockchain, another green ball drops. Yet only the second one resulted in a change of ownership in what we could call a trade.
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:50:34
I agree, they should have curtailed margin on a pair which has next to no liquidity. The run has lasted around 2 months before it crashed, it wasn't a sudden spike up.

@_date: 2019-06-07 13:53:58


No exchange offers insured loans. The potential for borrowers to go into negative account balances is always there. Most of the time margin calls and liquidations, on Polo or elsewhere, prevent this from occurring, but it doesn't always work, not even in the traditional markets (stocks, futures or forex).
@_date: 2019-06-06 23:56:42
You borrow BTC to go long on the CLAM/BTC pair (or any other x/BTC pair). It crashed and positions weren't liquidated fast enough before accounts went into the negative, meaning longs lost their money *and* some of the borrowed BTC which they got from lenders.
This is a risk that lending carries.

**Finex, Okcoin.com, (maybe others who bank in Taiwan)**   - banking problems, no USD in or out ~~(fiat out only in CHF/HKD at Finex)~~. Update: now no international wires of any kind for Finex. Substantial price premium. 
**BTCe** - banking problems, but fiat still works via 3rd parties
 
**Chinese exchanges in general (Okcoin.cn, Huobi, etc)** - no BTC out, only fiat. Massive price discount.
The rest are unaffected (except perhaps a few minor ones), but the ones above used to make up the majority of the volume. Therefore, depending on how the price is calculated in the widgets, you might see different numbers. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 01:51:16


To be absolutely correct, you withdraw strictly USDT tokens and not USD that way. 
Otherwise you are right.
You might as well do it via BTC or LTC or whatever, since the USD=USDT peg doesn't work outside. The Tether tokens are trading at around 92-93 cents on Kraken, for example. Currently (almost?*) nobody can send them to Tether, the company, to exchange them for 1 USD.
From what I know, they give you 1 USDT for every USD you want to withdraw if you want to do it via Tether on Finex. It's just a pegged token,  but now with a broken peg. 
Had only Finex been struck with these banking issues and not Tether, then arbitrage would have made sure that the spread between Finex and the rest of the exchanges remained reasonable.
Now, besides liquidity considerations and speculative choices, like withdrawing USDT to keep and hoping that the peg will re-establish itself, *there is almost no edge to be gained no matter what someone does to get capital out*.
There *might* be some minor arbitrage still going on **within** Taiwan as last time I heard domestic wires still worked, but that's clearly not enough to keep the spread down. I heard some people in Taiwan were rushing to arb BTC on Finex, but I'm not certain about Tether (USDT) .

If your bank accepts CHF or HKD then you could wire out money right now, you just have to email support about it as they didn't update the UI yet. The conversion fee should be much lower than the BTC (or alt) price premium.
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:31:11
You can move out USDT which you can get by converting your Finex USD 1 for 1 to USDT. Tether has the same problem as Finex, they are unable to send you USD for USDT. 
USDT on Kraken is currently trading at 92 cents or so, which, due to arbitrage, equals the premium on Finex. 
The end result is that it currently doesn't matter which avenue you choose if you are looking to move fiat off Bitfinex. Whether you do it through buying BTC, LTC, ETH or opting to use Tether, the only difference is in liquidity.
@_date: 2017-04-17 23:27:26


@_date: 2017-04-23 00:25:45


No, USD is USD on Finex. If your balance shows 50 USD then they owe you 50 USD and not 50 USDT(Tether).
It's a slightly complicated issue, but leaving out some (perhaps important) details, long story short is:
USDT is accepted, *as an option*, for deposits or withdrawals. You deposit 100 USDT and get 100 USD (- fee) on your Finex account. You can also withdraw by converting USD to USDT (1 for 1).
Tether is unable to send you USD for the USDT you bought somewhere since their banking is effectively cut as well, as far as international wires go anyway.
This is the reason why the USDT/USD spread is almost exactly the same elsewhere as the FinexBTC /KrakenBTC spread, for example. Or why the BTC/USDT price on Poloniex mirrors the BTC/USD on Finex. Arbitrageurs swoop in once the spreads diverge.


Yes, they *might* at some point, and I'm definitely of the opinion that this is a completely unnecessary risk for Finex as a company, but this is not the root of the current problem. 
The majority owners of Finex have a minority stake in Tether. Both also base their banking in Taiwan. 
Settlement between the two (USDT &lt;-&gt; USD) might be going without issues, but this doesn't, by itself, help to kill the spread between Finex and the other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:13:57
Obviously someone is closing the arbitrage loop by getting USD for USDT from either Finex or Tether. Otherwise Finex would be sitting at a mega premium and USDT/USD on Kraken would trade well below 1. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:44:49
Indeed, I find it quite like that GBTC will keep at least some of its premium for the foreseeable future. The current difference is just obscene though, with more than 50% above spot.
It would still make sense for some of the GBTC holders to simultaneously sell for 350 and re-buy for ~230-240, even if it's a one off thing.

ISIS fighters receive their salaries in USD after all. There is no evidence Bitcoin has been used in any significant extent by them.

Bitcoin ETF (non-)decision tomorrow. They can keep delaying it indefinitely, and I expect they'll delay the decision again tomorrow. On the other hand, if by some miracle they approve it'll easily trigger a 100 dollar 15m candle.

Yeah it's called trading. People have dedicated their entire lives trying to master the art of it. Might seem easy enough just looking at a chart, but that's with hindsight. 
The tuition fee by the market can be harsh so whatever you do, wherever you decide to trade, start small. Put aside a certain amount (a few hundred bucks is plenty) and trade with that, no matter what it brings. If you blow it all then tough luck, at least you didn't lose more, and if it grows you won't need to put in more money as it'll grow with you. After a couple of months (if you survive) you'll start to get a glimpse at the intricacies of trading. 
Pick a reputable exchange, compare the fees (can be futures, if you want, but be careful with leverage) and trade away. 
As someone mentioned, is the place for trading discussions. Just remember, there are no magic indicators and everybody is talking their own positions. Trade your own account.

Traders call it the volumizer. It's a bot that trades batches of up to 1-2k coins out of the blue with close to 0 price movement. Made the OBV look really good in the run-up.

They created that site themselves to have something "on the outside" to refer to. It's just one entity in the network of companies and websites they are running to create the illusion.

Here is a detailed article about Onecoin, if anyone is interested. 
Plus another with bitcoiners crashing an event 
Several of the alleged co-conspirators have experience in running ponzi schemes or scams and the Onecoin operation involves a number of front companies to create the necessary illusion. (Fake cryptocurrency tracking website, fake auditing firm, even a "fake" edition of Forbes, etc). In fact I seriously doubt they even have an actual blockchain. The "exchange" on their website is, I assume, a sham as well with a made-up buy/ask side. 
They managed to create just the right mixture of technical mumbo-jumbo, mlm sales tactics and a get rich quick ponzi structure to be extremely effective. Behind it they have financial mechanisms to have some control over the amount of payouts to maximize the run time of the scam without the "investors" noticing problems immediately. 10-60d "KYC" procedure with plenty of rejections, artificially set coin price, artificial "mining" for which they don't have "slots" available. You don't buy coins btw, you buy an "educational package". After that they claim to owe you nothing. As an extra, you get some "tokens" which you can turn into "Onecoins" by "setting them to mine", if they have the "slots" available.
They also have "vault" where you can miraculously increase your "coins" by 100-1000% a year if you just leave them locked up there.
Hilarious tidbit. They recently announced that they'll effectively increase the max amount of "coins" and rate of new supply tenfold (or so, i don't remember), by introducing a "new blockchain". 
Just listen to the thunderous applause as she announces it:
But don't worry, they'll double your "coins" on the "new blockchain". Even the worst penny stock scams take care not to insult your intelligence this blatantly.
People who have ever dealt with *actual* cryptocurrencies or just step back a second and think can easily identify it for the scam it is, nonetheless I fear that by the time it implodes it'll have swallowed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of real money. If I had to bet I'd wager that they'll pull the rug on the ponzi by the end of this year or early next year, but until then make sure nobody you know gets suckered into this by increasingly greedy "salesmen".

You cannot even transfer the (alleged) coins off their servers. There are no wallets (apart from theirs) and their alleged blockchain seems to be "private", if it exists at all, which I doubt.

That's not where the demand came from. The overwhelming majority of people actually buying USDT with USD were arbitrageurs who essentially delivered them to people dumping their coins on USDT-only exchanges. Whenever USDT pairs on altcoin exchanges traded below their USD equivalent on Bitfinex it essentially meant USDT was trading above dollar, and this created an extremely lucrative arb opportunity sucking USDT out of Finex.
