You're on Reddit, a site notorious for not using SSL by default (even though they could terminate it on Elastic Load Balancers at Amazon). Your authentication cookie flies in cleartext with every HTTP request.
Google had faith that their privately owned fiber was secure; sure, sometimes you're not wearing enough tinfoil on your head. Lesson learned. Encrypt All The Things.

The blockchain is an immutable ledger of every transaction. If your wallet ever gets associated with you, they'll know every transaction ever made. Given enough time, it would be trivial to associate a large portion of wallets to people's IRL identities (unless you're going to constantly rotate through wallets). At some point, you're going to make a traceable transaction.
