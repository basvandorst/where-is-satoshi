Then they're late to the game with a product that brings nothing new to the table.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:24:18
So the argument here is to sell because everyone else is selling (despite the fact that we've seen bitcoin drop in value and come back up countless times)?  Alright lol 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:57:41
I think it's better known as "buy low, sell high"
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:01:40
I don't think there's anyone on the planet who doesn't regret not investing a few bucks in bitcoin a few years back (assuming they were able to).

"EDIT: The transaction now shows again on the blockexplorer with 0/6 confirmations. For two hours it was not there, checked on different browsers even. Does anyone have advice as to how to make it go through? I just want the funds at this point."
No, not really.  Bitcoin transactions are slow and I've had a transfer take me as long as 13 hours complete.  If you're lucky it might be done in half that time.  The network is overloaded.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:01:52
Dunno, we're at ATH
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:33:45
What's a "buyable dip"?  If you are convinced it's gonna go back up then why wouldn't you believe you'd make money on it either way?  If it drops some more you can buy some more.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:21:46
Yeah, Andreas has made a lot of people rich.  He totally deserves all of this for all the good work he has done for crypto over the years.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:23:00
Because it's arguably a safer return than gambling on altcoins.   20-25% is certainly possible and that's a massive return.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:53:01
Bitcoin is volatile.  It goes up and it goes down.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:19:51
arrogant moron
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:49:04
Yeah or alternatively you can just give away your investment at a 30-40% loss to what you paid, selling merely because everyone else is selling at this particular moment.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:53:43
LOL they wanna buy the dip so badly
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:31:23
Nothing in the data speaks to 11.9K USD (price at the time of this post) being a current "high" to sell at.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:52:45
This is absolutely false.  Websites can in fact make requests to localhost:
Here are the steps the reporter laid out to reproduce the issue:
This is a nightmare bug for Electrum.  It really doesn't get any worse than this.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:32:21
No one had to panic sell their coins to those traders.  They could have just held

The idea of a transaction getting rejected after X amount of time is a myth - transactions may be "forgotten" by bitcoin core clients after a period of time, but other nodes may be running different software which theoretically could confirm your stuck transaction after several weeks, or even years for that matter.  There's no sense of it being rejected from the network because too much time passed.  As far as the protocol is concerned, that's a myth.
The transaction can be theoretically be re-sent (from the exchange's side, in this case), described as follows:
"If you create a new transaction with the same bitcoins, and if the new transaction gets confirmed, then the old unconfirmed transaction will become invalid (since it tries to spend bitcoins that you don't have anymore).  All nodes will then drop the invalid old transaction from their memory and will refuse to accept it from anyone that tries to broadcast it."

He doesn't understand cryptocurrencies so he should refrain from comment on cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:41:43
plot twist: he's buying the dip
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:13:08
Credit cards usually have a max amount.  People will hit the max and spend half their paycheck paying back the minimums.  Probably won't even be able to stay above water with the ~20-25% interest.  Will just be a matter of time until they default on those debts.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:13:43
This should be a wake up call.  All Bitcoin software needs security auditing to catch stuff like this ASAP.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:57:22
Yeah, not like we've heard FUD out of China before that caused a 50% drop or anything right?
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:47:55
Does the transaction still say zero confirmations?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:31:46
No one's being defrauded of anything.  They're being bought and sold according to subjective valuations which change over time (rapidly, in this case).  If you trade on emotion and not research then you're most likely going to lose money.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:40:57
TBH, no one knows shit in this market.  Another piece of unpredictable fake news FUDshit like what came out yesterday could throw the whole market into a tailspin again.  Or positive sentiment could drive the market through the roof again, for that matter.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:00:13
Dunno, article says he was in a state of major stress.  Don't think that's easy to fake.  Assuming that it's real, thank fuck they let him go.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:54:31
If it crashed to zero you would have hated yourself a lot more for not paying off your loans when you had the chance.  Like with a lot of things, it hurts a lot more to have it in your hands and let it slip away than to miss out by bad timing (or other factors).
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:45:09
News story here says he's safe now
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:56:52
Jesus!  Why would you do that??  I'd advise you to stop investing as well until you can learn how to zoom out on charts and hold on through FUDshit.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:06:42
Getting weak??
WE ARE WAY UP FROM A MONTH AGO.  ZOOM OUT.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:17:23
Eh why would he want to actually take a risk putting his money where his mouth is when he can get just as much attention merely talking out of his ass in public?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:34:53
Oh man I'm so pissed I didn't figure out the winning lottery numbers before they were played
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:04:17
His knowledge of bitcoin is probably limited to what he overheard from his great-grandson at the Christmas dinner table
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:52:31
Apologies, I misread your post as sarcasm (literally 1.1 euro) rather than talking about the rate
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:09:17
Pour one out for the folks who bought in at 19k and panic sold at 11k
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:23:54
Little different when we're talking about life-changing amounts of money
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:17:59
tl;dr - "I know nothing about bitcoin, but here's my opinion on bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:26:32
You don't need to trade at exchanges.

"Morgan Stanley has reached a $3.2 billion settlement with state and federal authorities, the New York attorney general's office announced Thursday.
In the deal, the investment bank acknowledges that it misrepresented the risks of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2008 housing and financial crisis."
By their own admission, they are liars who can't be trusted.
Fuck what they think.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:21:12
Got a better chance of winning the lottery 5 times in a row.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:01:57
Can't speak to the volatility, but people would just transact in smaller units than BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:17:48
The hashing algorithm can be changed.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:56:56
Because most people involved right now don't really believe in it and just want to get rich quick.
