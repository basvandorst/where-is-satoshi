It already is mining profitably.  My electric bill for my entire house is only about $7.10 a day averaged through out the year including the fact that I have electric heat in a part of the country where winters regularly see several weeks of sustained below zero temps.  Right now my entire house costs just less than $0.30 an hour.  Lights, heat, AC, dishwasher, fridge, hot water, tv, space heater etc.  there is no way that a single GPU mining rig is going to cost even close to as much as my entire house.
Besides like I said the machine is being run in the back room of an off site office where I don’t pay for electricity anyway.

Thank you for that.  I was thinking the same thing but I read about the horror stories and start to panic and I don’t really know what to believe.  
I have started a very small mining operation (earns only about  .01 a month). Should I get a HWW and just start having my payouts go there for the future?

To be honest I am not entirely certain, I have seen people say that slushpool is more profitable than other pools.  But it seems as though you mine a specific type of coin?  So it might not work well with my ultra budget rig?  Where as with AwesomeMiner it mines a bunch of different coins paid out in BTC??
Honestly this might be a good topic for someone else to ELI5  but maybe would be more on topic in another sub?

Long story - the machine is sitting in the back room at an office.  It is not costing me anything.  Even so electricity here is very inexpensive.  If it was plugged in at my house it would still only cost a few pennies a day.  The only reason it is not at my house is because I simply don’t have the room.

I’m mining with a single GTX980 at an average of 2.9 GH/s.  (Usually on the Blake2s algo is most profitable)  So not very fast.  I have earning about 20k to 25k Satoshi per 24 hours.

Yeah I am aware of the cost but I am thinking about down the road when my .003 is .03 or .3 or 3 or 30 etc.  I figure why wait.  Get one now for future protection?
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:12:40
Yes I was aware of that.  But you explain it much better than I do.

So how many zeros are in a million brazilian?

Nah, my full time gig is radio.  I do this to earn some fun money for my trapshooting habit and to be able to invest a little in BTC!

So that's a little weird - I used to live in Co Springs too.  Are these the proverbial "they" and are they following me?  LOL!

I actually host a radio show and talk about what goes on in my hometown 3 hours a day, 5 days a week.  I know more than most about what's happening, and that's why I figured I'd ask here.  There a lot of smart people that know a lot about mining and the players involved in it.  This company seems to have no actual connection to my house e town in any way and in fact most of us didn't even know there was a large scale mining operation in our little town of 58,000 plus people.

No the building was literally right next to the local power company.  It might have actually been on the property.  I don't remember exactly.

Appears to be, yes.

3"G" Ventures - it's Grand Forks, ND and I did Google it and found nothing.  Hence, "I couldn't find anything on them."  Solid comment.
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:18:25
Grand Forks, ND.  The company is reported as 3G Venture and/or 3G Ventures (with an S) depending on which newspaper reported it.  That's about the only details. I could fins.  A few others suggested "3D" Ventures supposedly based in CA but not sure of that is the same company or just a typo.

It was actually on the lot or very close to the lot of a local electric company.
