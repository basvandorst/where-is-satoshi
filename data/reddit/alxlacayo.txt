If I need to transfer money from my USD Wallet in coinbase to my bank do I have to pay a fee?
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:35:50
Where the people that said we’d never see 5k,6k,7k,8k again?
@_date: 2018-08-08 10:51:34
The real question is at what level do you buy? I previously thought $5,XXX would be a nice entry, but if it were to hit that, I’d probably be hesitant.
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:39:01
I expect Cryptocurrency to remain bearish for 1-2 years
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:13:15
It’s only the bottom until it’s not the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:54:55
Obviously I should have bought at 6k, but should I buy now or wait? 10k fomo
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:15:54
Lol it’s been clear for a week or two now that bitcoin is going nowhere fast. Horrible time to get in right now.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:37:02
Yea it’s still under $6k...
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:34:58
Nope. Waiting for the bottom. Still plenty of momentum the wrong way.
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:13:07
$5,XXX imminent.
@_date: 2018-08-01 05:57:24
Crashes to $7400 almost. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:12:36
I share the same belief that crypto will be in a bear market for 1+ years. That run to 20k woke everyone up and it seems like everyone is waiting for the next leg up. Like, this year. Doubt that happens.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:40:48
OP will be posting the same image at $4k
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:29:04
That easy? 
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:22:52
Hopefully it's a lot easier to use. As a newcomer I'm terrified about properly storing my coins. One mistake and they're gone forever.
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:58:03
Ouch. But you probably would have sold them already. Everything happens s for a reason.
@_date: 2018-06-21 10:45:29
Yea right.. maybe $40k
@_date: 2019-02-25 08:19:57
So $2,XXX still happening at some point?
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:55:16
Maybe it’s bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:23:30
Never ever say “X days are over”
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:37:15
Not a chance that this is the bottom. This bear market will last years.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:12:45
These machines are a scam
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:29:55
Mass adoption probably won’t ever happen. I know banks have lots of cons but so does crypto, like if you lose your keys you can’t call anyone to recover them. You’re kinda screwed...
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:26:56
Anyone else heavily annoyed by all the trash spam articles in Google from Smartereum?
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:02:15
He bought at 20k and is on the brink 
@_date: 2018-11-16 07:54:55
Anyone else feel like 2k is likely? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:16:03
Do not enter here. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:35:51
Will go to $2000
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:25:04
Yea it’s great until it falls further.......
@_date: 2019-01-22 10:46:23
Lol guy this is going way down soon. Don’t buy now.
@_date: 2018-11-18 06:59:22
Running from reality?
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:46:53
This is falling rapidly.. why would you buy now?
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:30:38
Lol serious? That paper probably gets tossed to the nearest can.
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:07:21
Bitcoin is too complicated for a non-tech person. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:15:23
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:08:20
I don’t think we’ll see a major bull run for a couple years 
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:06:20
850,000 sent. 34 opens. 4 clicks. CTR -18%.
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:53:10
He’s probably not targeting the bargain hunters like yourself. Cheap prices doesn’t mean more sales...
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:15:00
Don’t buy here. It’s been flat for a week or so. Going down soon.
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:40:29
I believe it’s going to go below $3,000 at some point.
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:34:11
Wait 
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:55:15
Buy below $3,000.
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:08:50
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:54:17
Lol why would anyone buy here...
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:26:21
La Quinta
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:26:29
Where? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:21:03
Probably 1-5% see it max. Anything else though!
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:25:05
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:28:30
I couldn’t imagine trying to teach old people about keeping their private keys safe
@_date: 2018-07-31 03:24:28
Honesty these machines may do more harm than good. They look so sketchy and cheaply built that it looks like a scam. I’d never buy from one of those.
@_date: 2019-05-09 12:11:12
@_date: 2019-05-09 11:15:55
It’ll be years before a massive run
@_date: 2018-12-24 20:35:45
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:46:18
Unless you’re a developer yes you’ll need a way to integrate .....
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:16:06
Sell it for $1200 in 5 years
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:46:56

How will the Binance hackers ever liquidate their coins without being traced?
