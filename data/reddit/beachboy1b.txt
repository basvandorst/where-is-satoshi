ONE CAN ONLY SPECULATE
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:47:36
Wow, deflect any more and they could classify you as a *shield*! 
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:04:35
I can *actually* hear you scraping the bottom of the barrel! Neat.
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:39:30
Actually, you're the one blindly throwing accusations around and hoping you're talking a straight white male, because according to your thinking that's a *bad* thing to be. 
Tell me, if that doesn't scream "racial prejudice", what would you call it? And are you seriously going to pretend you aren't a Liberal? You came after me for posting in a pro-American subreddit, so you clearly think I'm some kind of moron if you're going to call me a "Leftist". 
So let's review, you attack me for *allegedly* being white, then when you're presented with information that blows you out of the water, you instead backpedal and project your own system of political beliefs onto me in a vain attempt to gain some sort of high ground in this. You literally are incapable of seeing you came after me with a predisposition that because I comment on a pro-American, anti-global governance sub, that I must 100% be a white wealthy male who "never" experienced poverty.
Go take your identity politics and shove them up your ass. I've never seen someone so disconnected from reality that they harbor such a deep hatred for a race like you, to the point where they make such flagrant accusations and attempt to make others feel guilty for succeeding in life. So I have to be white to be successful? I have to be white to love my country? I have to be white have worked as a *bag-boy*? Just where do you stand, exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:41:46
This is misleading.
The $12 fee is a Monthly Maintenance fee, which *is not a new fee*.  Most people probably never noticed it because they have more than enough money in the account, or are enrolled in BofA's "Preferred Rewards" program. Every other Bank has fees, and they can be easily avoided.
Not to mention they have no problem refunding the fee if you ask. You ever spoke to someone over the phone for banking? Bank of America does the same thing, and it's even better if you happen to be considered "Wealth Management".
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:43:13
Anywhere you move to, you'll find banks have their own fees. It's not just Bank Of America, just thought you should know that.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:49:50
This would undoubtedly lead to the full centralization of cryptocurrency. Ver is a real son of a bitch.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:36:54
Depends on who you ask. It's only a game when you lose, but it's a major achievement to shove in the faces of everyone else when you win.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:45:02
For what? Charging fees for what is otherwise a free service? A bank holds your money for you, and from what I understand, is also one of the only banks not having an issue with people purchasing BTC.
Plus, this is misleading. The $12 fee has been around forever, it is not new.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:47:24
Also, if you make a direct deposit of at least $250 per month, you avoid the fee that way. The minimum balance requirement won't affect you if you do the direct deposit approach, it's one or the other.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:55:34
But it isn't your money. As long as you hold funds in a bank account, you have created an agreement for what is essential an "unsecure loan", from which you are able to draw from with no questions asked. 
Plus, you have a debit card right? And the ability to make electronic transactions from your bank account? Plus, your account is monitored for fraud, hence it being called a "maintenance" fee. Not everyone is able to join a Credit Union, normally they have specific requirements.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:50:27
Wow, take it easy man.
First of all, people should strive to take themselves to better income-generating jobs. This isn't punishing people for having lower balances, no one forced them to do business with Bank of America, or any other bank for that matter.
And are you seriously assuming my race? You deliberately went into my commenting history looking for something to *attack me* with. Misinformation doesn't help *anyone*, and the fact of the matter is, you don't even reside in the United States. Don't even pretend to understand the plight of those who have had to work their way up, especially since having a job as a bag-boy for a beginning job is somehow able to be considered an insult to you.
This is a sub for bitcoin. Leave your bigoted and racially-charged political ideas at the door, asshole. I don't know how people are in Canada, but you're doing a very poor job of representing them. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:51:31
I don't even have a full bitcoin, and at this point in time, I've lost money. But we've all lost money; and the truth of the situation, is that Bitcoin *is* going to rise again. It will rise higher than before.
That is why we *hodl*.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:56:43
I think it will. People should have learned their lesson to HODL, even as tempting as it may be to sell. If the sell orders go crazy, and it drops way down, I'm hodling *and* buying*. 
I'm not looking for some quick cash, I'm looking to get wealthy later down the line. Always invest for the future.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:32:19
I've heard mixed reviews. Some people have even gone so far as to call them a scam. To be honest, it's more of a gamble than just buying bitcoin, and the return isn't that great unfortunately. That's just what I've heard though, I could very well be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:36:24
This isn't so much a bubble as it is a rubber ball. You can poke a hole in the ball several times, but it can *always* be patched right back up. If you have the right tools (in this case, investments), you can even close the hole permanently without risk of the same hole opening back up. 
This is why the price of bitcoin always gets high, drops, and then goes even *higher* than before.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:10:26
I shall pray for a glorious dip in price, in an attempt to preserve your dignity. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:46:30
It's called the "Deep State" in the US, and it is *very* real. The UN and it's idea of a centralized "global" currency isn't some boogey-man, it's also a very real threat to the free market. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:13:40
I think I've got the gist of it now, I appreciate your input. Guess I'll hodl for a bit, and just watch the ride.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:13:46
You should be. I predict early 2018, we'll break $20K. It'll fluctuate a good deal, possibly even drop to $15K, but with confidence so high right now and the futures having been approved, I think we could be looking at massive gains. Even having just a couple hundred dollars worth of bitcoin will grow exponentially within the next couple years.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:22:30
You might get another chance later tonight. I've noticed the price dips substantially in the later hours (East Coast US btw).
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:59:41
I'm going to pretend that sentence makes sense, and that all you said was there's no reason anything would have changed. 
The drastic change in the number of illegal immigrants entering the country *absolutely* increased during the Obama Administration, there is no denying that. To say there is no reason to believe anything has changed is absolute ignorance. The census takes place every ten years, so the most recent census is from 2010. Does that mean that's the most accurate information we have? Does that mean nothings changed and we can still use it as accurate fact, even though it's seven years old? Absolutely not, the number of people in the US is always increasing, it's not a stagnant number.
Same goes with the number of illegal immigrants, and how much they actually affect our economy.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:10:18
Actually, no it's not. The "recovery" you saw? Obama never put forth any actual bills or executive orders that drove it. The "recovery" was essentially driven by various members of congress, never Obama. In case you missed it, the recession lasted well through the Obama presidency. And have you not heard of him pulling us out of the Paris Accords? Are you aware of what the Paris Accords are? 
As for Trump's businesses, it seems you're referring to "his" bankruptcies. I would like to remind you Trump himself has *never* gone bankrupt. Trump-related businesses, aka businesses started by Trump and sold out to other Entrepreneurs, have failed and gone bankrupt. Atlantic City went to shit, and tried to blame it on Trump; I've lived right outside of AC, and it's always been dumpy. Trump made the right move to pull out of that failing dumpster fire.
I'm sorry I keep coming back, but don't just pull things out of your ass if you don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:08:43
Also it very well might not stop. With such a steady growth, people are not as inclined to panic-sell as they are to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:05:14
Except he's done nothing of the sort. Are you really going to sit here and tell me you don't want tax reform? 
And why not "fuck the President before me"? You brought this straight to a racial place. If you're not going to provide me anything more than an opinion piece on why you hate the President, I'd really rather not. I will not sit here and argue with you.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:27:24
I don't think Trump is "fucking the planet", and you're getting a little too political but that's fine.
I don't like the Left, and I don't trust Establishment Republicans. I don't know how much you follow politics, but neither side is treating the office of the Presidency or the President himself with the respect deserved. They would love to have you believe the current tax setup is better than reform, which is not the case and surely you must realize this. One must also realize that these same people who wish to control you with the Federal Reserves currency, will do anything to make sure they get their paycheck and keep yours as small as possible.
And they benefits I'm entitled to as a tax-paying citizen, considering the amount of illegal immigrants who drive on the same roads and bridges I do; they use the same public facilities that I do, and they sure as hell don't pay taxes. No, I'm entitled to these things because I'm a *working American*. I don't sit around on my ass, I contribute to society and *that's* what entitled me to these benefits. Uncle Sam just decided he wants to take a percentage of the money I earn, so he can blow it on foreign wars that needlessly put our armed forces in harms way.
By the way, what damage has President Trump caused to the country?? What cronies are you talking about? You evidently don't like the President, which is your opinion and is fine, but what has been done that makes him corrupt or self-serving?
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:13:36
I understand this, but my silver is a hedge against any kind of depression. Should the dollar ever greatly depreciate in value, silver still has it's worth along with gold.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:52:32
Well shit, let us know how it begins to work out. I (ironically) work for a bank, a desk jockey of sorts, and would *love* to spend my time doing useful things (very big on giving back to my local community) but more often than not am just completely drained from the work I do. So yeah, if this is a sustainable source of income that generates your predicted results, I'd drop $14K just to really seal the damn deal.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:09:35
Like some of the other guys here are saying, just hodl. Treat it like a violently aggressive/manic depressive IRA that you can dip into sometimes. Just be aware of the current trends, watch for the dips to buy on, and HODL THAT BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:09:12
Also ABSOLUTELY buy yourself a hardware wallet if you plan on going all-in with investing in BTC. It is by-far the most secure way to keep your investment safe. The Ledger Nano S is my personal recommendation, and I would also encourage buying directly from the [manufacturer's website](
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:12:20
Yes. Why? Because Bitcoin, like everything else, is worth the value we give it. Bitcoin, unlike current fiat currency (USD, EURO, etc.), also gives more freedom of maneuverability. As you and the other gentlemen correctly stated, it's primarily being treated like an asset to be invested in and HODL; and unlike many of the normal stocks and assets, it's growth rate dips and rises at higher and higher amounts. It's continually becoming more valuable, because of it's *potential*. Digital currency, controlled fully by it's owner, offers security that so many banks simply can't beat. 
Granted, it may not be within our lifetime that cryptocurrency fully takes over. This is especially possible if we return to the gold standard with the USD, having our dollar backed by not only gold but also silver as well. And I would have to say, given it's prominence, something like that could also greatly bolster the value of the bitcoin. This is all purely hypothetical though, and I'm certain there are many other factors I have not considered. Simply food for thought.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:36:25
Probably. And depending on how everything goes on the 18th, we might *surpass* that number before then. Or we might crash down 10K, either or.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:42:01
The Government, especially the IRS, is afraid of anything they can't control or take money from (illegally, I might add). Bitcoin is both. They don't tax me for my gold and silver, which is also property that fluctuates in value AND can be exchanged for fiat currency. So my question is, *what makes Bitcoin so different*?
This is another power-grab by one of the most corrupt institutions in the United States, and with some of the shit they've pulled, they shouldn't be allowed *anywhere* near our money.
Perhaps you've heard "taxation is theft" before, and maybe even scoffed at that phrase. The truth is, the Government uses the IRS as a *weapon*, and the money they extort from you is completely and utterly wasted. Why do you think our new President is pushing for tax reform? Why do so many members of congress want to "Audit the Fed"? Because they're trying to keep the corrupt branches of government from fucking us even more than they have been. Bitcoin was supposed to be anonymous and out of the Governments reach. Now they're trying to slowly drag us in until they get their grubby little hands all over our sweet, sweet bitcoin.
Edit: a sentence
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:39:35
Just come out and say it, you very clearly feel that bitcoin is a scam. You're suggesting a centralized hub because you don't feel comfortable with it so spread out, you're accustomed to having your currency under control and at a stable value. 
If the concept scared you this much, you shouldn't even be here.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:37:10
This paper also happens to be *ten years old*.
In case you missed it, we've had a massive influx of illegal immigrants since 2007.  In other words, this information is useless and does not apply to now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:04:39
The IRS is applying archaic methods to a relatively new technology, and couldn't give two shits if it's unclear on how to properly file taxes for cryptocurrency.
They're using this to further the argument against currencies like Bitcoin, and would love to nothing more than to federally regulate the ever-loving shit out of it, eventually phasing it out of existence when it becomes worthless next to fiat due to the inevitable bullshit fees and additional taxes they *absolutely* will add.
This, of course, has also brought the government into the equation. They are using the IRS as a weapon to intimidate people into paying taxes. People don't pay their taxes because they want to, they pay their taxes because there are *severe* consequences for not doing so. Then the Government goes and spends our tax money on utter bullshit, lies about it, and then spends the most minimal amount possible on things we really need.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:30:29
This seems rather active, so I'll ask here since everything is really starting to pick up the pace. How does it work when it comes to bitcoin and *taxes*?
Are we all supposed to be reporting gains/losses and all that good stuff to the IRS? Or are there thousands of people just having it go unreported?? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:48:00
Well, it's decided, I'm going to invest some USD into a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:46:11
Actually I just generated my first couple reports. Turns out I didn't really make any gains, only very small losses. I guess I can report them since they're in my favor? In the meantime I should probably learn when I should sell, and not just on a random whim. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:28:14
Try and contact customer service. Unfortunately though, this isn't something we can just talk you around. Let's hope BTC keeps climbing instead of it crashing, for your sake.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:46:23
In two days, we get a taste of futures. Everyone is hodling, and we very well may see no major movement till Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:11:06
But wait, if people panic sell and the price drop drastically, doesn't that mean I can just buy bitcoin at an extremely low pricing? I mean any time it drops that much, why would you sell? Why would anyone sell on a drop for something like bitcoin? 
Or is that the whole point of people irrationally panic-selling?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:56:19
Why? This is the beginning of his investment, you have to start somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:44:56
They receive plenty of other benefits, least of which has already been mentioned here. That's all I wish to say on the matter anymore. This should not even be a discussion, considering *they don't even belong here*.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:20:18
This isn't about me. This is about the people who actively use bitcoin, who want to use it as a way to free themselves (for the most part) from the restraints of fiat currency. Just because I hold does not mean I do not care about my fellow investor. We are all in this together, bitcoin only has value as long as we give it value. That means I must also care if bitcoin is treated unfairly by the government.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:50:39
Exactly right. I *almost* bought in under 8k but I was too hesitant. Very excited for everything to come, whether it drops or goes up again.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:36:17
I didn't say crash down to 10K, I said *crash down 10K*.  
Let me show you: 12,000 - 10,000 = 2,000
*that* most certainly is a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:27:05
I don't disagree with what you're saying at all. I believe the country is in a very dangerous state where people are perfectly fine with being on welfare, doing bare-minimum jobs and just skating by. 
I think it's fair to say that much more could be done, and *should* be done by the government to prevent a "nanny state" from forming.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:28:24
It just jumped up to $11,870. We very well may hit $12K, and with a new record high, that will only encourage the community to hodl and go even higher.
BUY BEFORE IT GETS TOO LATE
Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any potential losses, nor is this to be construed as financial advice. Please consult an expert for any questions concerning taxes or any investment inquiries.
Edit: it dropped down to around $11,400. It could drop more, it might not go back down below $11K. Just watch for the new bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:33:13
I can say that because I trust the government about as far as I could toss a congressman. And you mistake my meaning behind "it's hardly mentioned". If I were to go up to anyone else and say to them "did you know the government actively provides itemized receipts for what they spend?", they'd look at me in disbelief. Just because articles exist does not mean they are generally "common knowledge". There are still people unaware of Bitcoin, surprisingly. With that said, the average citizen deserves to have the spending explained to them, instead of giving them a spreadsheet with not only historical records but projected costs for the future. 
And the only reason *I* know these things is because of *whistleblowers* exposing these instances. The best way to describe it is with the case of Harvey Weinstein; it was widely known he had committed some rather horrible sex-related crimes, but they were buried and kept from the eyes of the public. Same thing with much of government spending, yes the documents are there *but* very clearly they prefer it if the average citizen know as little as possible, understand as little as possible, and interfere as little as possible.
To put it in a nutshell, people are rarely prompted to do research into the federal budget, and even far less often do consider doing individual research. Many are familiar with "Audit the Fed", but far too many of these Americans do not know why we need to audit the fed. Any information they *do* know is of course second-hand. Perhaps you may disagree with my thoughts, which is fine. My belief is that if no one actively asks for it, the Government is totally cool with never actually taking time to point out the existence of these documents.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:44:00
Is that desktop based? Or a paper wallet? While I'm at it, what do you recommend?

@_date: 2017-12-02 11:34:03
Have you read the details of the proposed reform? Don't just say yes for arguments sake, I genuinely want to know. I ask because you also seem to have a weak understanding of how the current tax system works; it was specifically designed around the idea that the poor stay poor, and the wealthy pay exceedingly high amounts. The only people who get tax breaks from this are certain businesses, churches, and politicians. This current model is *not* to the benefit of the American public, and reform is 100% needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:56
No, that doesn't make fiat better, only slightly more convenient when it comes to accessibility.

@_date: 2017-12-02 14:18:53
That's more or less what I meant. They need to stop offering an easy way out for people who just don't want to contribute to society. And if they won't do so willingly, it comes down to us to make these changes happen.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:12:20
It *will* bounce back. There's almost a guarantee it will. Why? Because any kind of "crash" would be intended for that very specific reason. First, it starts with a steep dip. Then, that's when the panic-sellers lose their shit and sell off practically everything, which will drive it down even further. The people waiting will then leap on the chance to buy at a far lower price, and if they aren't quick enough, those who panic-sold will not be able to buy back in at this lower price. We're talking very high network traffic, sales being delayed, a total cluster-fuck if it ever dropped that far. Always be prepared, and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:07:49
I jumped in one of the last days it was still under 8K. Do I regret not buying more? Eh, maybe. Was I still able to enjoy the jump over 11k? Briefly, but yes. It by no means made me exceedingly rich, but gave me a glimpse into the future.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:27:03
Do you have any advice for those of us starting? It's been merely weeks, and I have a fair amount of BTC and LTC, although nothing too major. I've been investing in increments of up to $20, at least 3 times every other day (when it's low of course), and pulling out slightly higher amounts when it peaks. Am I doing enough? Should I do more?

As for your other statement, the research performed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio successfully concluded the long-form birth certificate was fraudulently created. His own brother, Malik Obama, has attested several times that Barack was not born in the United States. Here's a [source]( from just last year. Sheriff Arpaio was persecuted by the Obama administration for his findings, and only just recently was he pardoned by the Trump administration. This is not racism; this is exposing a *fraud*.

I'll have to give it a look. I would definitely feel more comfortable having it in a desktop wallet than have it held with a third party. Coinbase has a great track-record so far, but one can never be too safe.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:53:17
It could. I personally sold just a little bit of my BTC, that way if it *does* drop, I have some funds to immediately buy with. If not, I kept the amount I sold low enough so I'm not going to take a huge hit.
Perhaps this isn't the fastest route, but it will mitigate any losses I take.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:03:29
It might not be coming. Then again it could be coming it 10 minutes; this has been some fairly good growth, so we're about due. If you want, only sell a small portion of your BTC. I only have so much, so I only sold about $100 worth. Maintain more in your wallet than you sell, stay away from halving if you have the intention of buying at a dip that may never come.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:14:19

Not so much a correction as it is a small dip. If you're gonna buy, buy enough to satiate yourself but save most of your funds in the even that it drops even lower.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:35:34
The biggest issue coinbase was facing is the fact that they were not prepared for intense traffic in their systems, which for now seems to be fixed.
It's a good place to start, but once you starting buying BTC, get either a paper wallet or a hardware wallet.

At this point, anything below 11K is a safe buy. It could jump above 12K within hours, it could drop below 10K in the same time period, although that's more unlikely. Buy where you think you should, but for heavens sake HODL from this point forward.

I'm sorry to say I don't know. I wish I could be a bit more helpful, but I myself am in the midst of my research still lol. I would definitely try to see if you can find people that actively use it, that's your best bet (to my knowledge).

Considering the fact that the FBI and CIA have not been acting in our best interest, i.e. the acting FBI director wrote up his speech clearing Hillary Clinton of all crimes *before* any choice could have possibly been made with enough evidence, that's straight up corruption. And it's not "tinfoil hat shit", it's fact. Very clearly it upsets you to the point where you flat-out refuse to believe anything other than what you've been spoon-fed your whole life. And in order for citizenship to be conferred to a child born outside of the US, the mother must reside within the US for *at least* 10 years prior to the birth of the child,  and at least 5 years after age 14 is an absolute requirement. Ann Dunham was 18 when she gave birth in '61, so no, she could not have legally conferred citizenship to him as the full requirements were never met. As to where the birth took place is extremely debatable. It's not my opinion the birth certificate provided was false, it's fact. Whether you believe it or not, that's your prerogative.
And here's a nice little history lesson, the Great Depression occurred because people panic-sold all of their assets because of an initial crash in the stock market, greatly decreasing the value of assets and commodities, which led to a severe disruption of trading, and ultimately caused what we have come to call the "Great Depression". It wasn't because people sat on their money or because the wealthy wasn't taxed enough, it's because there was no control when it came to the selling-off of assets. That's why today's banking institutions have such rigorous financial regulations.
And you're right, we do have plenty of homeless vets and children. So why did the Obama Administration never overhaul the Veteran's Affairs department, whose crimes I've seen first-hand? I watched Veteran be denied care, have their care delayed and *die*. You know who overhauled it? The Trump Administration. And you know what else we still have? Extremely high rates of inner city crimes. You know who runs these cities? Democrats, who refuse to work with the President out of spite. The Left only cares about these groups when it will benefit them politically or financially, and it's the same with the Republican Establishment who pretend to be "opposition". And we have an undereducated populace because the Obama Administration treated the public like mindless children, giving them free handouts and encouraged them to be totally dependent on big government.

I don't agree with your first sentence there, considering there's no provisions that will raise them later on, but as I had stated elsewhere I'm done talking politics in a bitcoin thread. It's your opinion, which is fine, but don't do the whole "tinfoil hat" bit to people here. It's uncalled for.

From what I've read, only about *800* people per year in the last 4 years have actually reported capital gains taxes from bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.
There's absolutely more than 800 people using bitcoin, and from what I've researched the IRS is just fucking the cryptocurrency community over with this extremely broad tax setup. I also found something called the "Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act", which is trying to make ALL cryptocurrency transactions under $600 exempt from needing to be reported.

It might drop to around 10K, but nothing like a major crash below that. 
As for the probability of one happening, it's inevitable. People who have been hodling for a shorter period of time will get nervous, they'll feel like it could crash at any moment; with the recent theft of millions in bitcoin, those feelings are exponentially greater. People will panic-sell, and drive the price down, albeit for not a very long time. Pay attention, or you may miss you chance.
Or, it could reach *14K, sending the market into a fucking frenzy*.

In theory, yes. We'll just have to see which direction futures will take Bitcoin, and at this point it really could go either way.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:53:23
They most certainly do not. Millions of them obtain what's called an ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number), which can be issued regardless of status. Instead of *paying*, they instead file for tax returns they are in no way entitled to.

Entertain for a moment the thought that suddenly there's *no one left interested in Bitcoin* after a certain period of time. As it stands, there are still great numbers of people unaware of what bitcoin is.
It *is* possible for the market to crash and never recover. It's highly unlikely, but still possible.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:22:55
I know at least on coinbase they have a reports tool under the "tools" menu selection, and from there it's a dropdown menu to select what kind of report you want, from what wallet, and how often you want to have one generated.
GDAX might have something similar, but I've yet to access it myself.

I'm predicting we'll have even sick gainz before 2017 is over. 
The risk potential for "shorting" bitcoin far exceeds anything I've seen before, due to its nearly unpredictable volatility. Yes, we've seen it always bounce back. However, the 18th is bringing something different to the table with futures, something we'll get a taste of on the 10th. An experienced trader may take the risk and try to sucker-punch bitcoin into dropping; an intelligent trader will simply buy in and let it grow on it's own. 
Bitcoin *will* reach valued we've only dreamed of. Some may panic sell and miss out, but such is the way of things.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:43:33
Well steady enough for bitcoin, i should say.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:54:06
I can understand your position. Think of it this way: it's spread out because people want *anonymity*. Bitcoin has great value, and if we centralize it, it would be very easy for a team of crypto-thieves to crack into the system and rob everyone blind. That's why it's so spread out, that's why we have such a vast variety of exchanges and wallets available.
Centralization works for fiat currency because it's controlled by the government, who can punish you for stealing it. Fiat currency is made easy to track, and hard to counterfeit.  Cryptocurrency, while it's "mined" by many different people (and machines), is damn near impossible to track. Maybe I don't want the government to know what I spend on groceries because it's not their damn business. I also don't have to keep my BTC in a bank for it to be safe, I can keep it in a hardware wallet. To call Bitcoin a scam, while understandable, is a mistake. This is very much about privacy and control over our assets, something we've seen very little of with fiat currency. We have the illusion of control, but ever since the gold standard disappeared, it's all gone tits-up. It's genuinely a wonder how hard they've worked to prevent the dollar from becoming worthless, since it's backed by basically nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:40:14
Holding is *not* dangerous, but spending without thinking *is*. Bitcoin is currently treated as both a currency and an asset. And not to mention, people are going to spend it anyway. Telling someone to not hold is essentially telling them to cash out at the next highest amount they see.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:43:42
Thanks man! I'll keep doing what I'm doing then, altering it as I learn more along the way. With what I've invest so far, I've only had about $1 in loss so I'm playing it fairly safe. I'll keep my wits about me, especially with the news about futures being available soon.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:34:16
A build-up. It's going to give very shortly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:14:07
Depends on how they try to do so. You would never be able to cash out quick enough on something like coinbase with the limits they have imposed.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:12:52
It could have been said a nicer way, I will agree. There's no reason we can't be civil, this isn't a political sub. The point trying to be made is that accepting information from authority without question can prove disadvantageous. We all want to make money, and no one *likes* to pay taxes. If we have to, it should be on *our* terms and not Uncle Sam's.

I never said I thought they weren't published, though that is what you seem to have taken from my comment nonetheless.

If people actually *understood* why they should be outraged, do you think the gentleman here would have asked for this?
And then I pose this to you, because it is well-known several millions of dollars have gone missing under the ever-watchful eye of the government.

That’s why it was originally intended for there to be only so much physical money available. Governments print money out the ass now, that’s what causes a lot of problems we face today. The US dollar was backed by gold and silver until 1933, and had been that was since 1879. Funnily enough, economists today blame the gold standard for the depression instead of the shitty business practices of the banks that almost destroyed the country. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:45:29
It will only take longer if people continue to treat it as an asset instead of a currency. And returning to the gold standard would make the US dollar infinitely more valuable than any other “fiat” currency, considering no country has their money actually backed by something like gold or silver (please correct if me I am wrong, obviously I do not know everything).
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:45:00
This is the best choice, considering many hodlers will be dead by the time crypto takes over fiat. Even then, it may be longer if the US goes back to the gold standard and reinforces the dollar.

You’re right, we just have one of the most crucial economies in the entire global scheme.
Not to mention, this specific post has Carl Sagan specifically talking about the US. 
Do you doubt some of the major bitcoin players reside in the US? Or do you think that they also don’t have a large bit of stock within the the American trade market?
Keep in mind that as of right now, Bitcoin has value solely because *we* give it value. It has nothing to back it up, and a very small minority in comparison to the rest of the world uses it in place of something like the Yen, Euro, or USD.

Innovation doesn't mean shit unless it makes the life of the consumer easier.
You may *think* Bitcoin is better than fiat currency, but here's the thing: fiat currency is only fiat because it isn't backed by anything aside from the promise of the Fed. If, and only if, the US dollar (for instance) were to be back by precious metals again, BTC could be considered redundant. Digital currency and access to my funds digitally are close cousins.
People seem to forget this because unfortunately the likelihood of this happening is low. That said, it would be much better for everyone if our money was actually backed by something.
