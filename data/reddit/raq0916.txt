Okay, we all know that Bitcoin will dip/correct/crash, or whatever you want to call it, eventually, but to say it will go as low as $1000 is foolish. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:18:27
I actually put in $10 yesterday. Made $5 over night. Thats more then I made with Bitcoin, and I put in $45 into Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:43:08
Im assuming he didnt know what pare meant, so he probably thought Bloomberg was saying that the Bitcoin price dropped
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:56:09
I chose to delay my response, like Bob Dylan
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:53:00
But my question was *did you sell it*. If you did, my God that was dumb. Never sell for lower then you bought
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:58:21
Fees are so avoidable tho. Just use GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:40:07
... They dont. A lot of people here have the motto “hold for life”. It all depends on you. Lets say you somehow double your money over night. Youd have to ask yourself if you really need those earning right then and there or whether you can afford to hold
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:22:04
How cold hearted must you be to make such a response AND think it was a good idea to post it
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:55
Shit ton of people buying in a short period of time
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:44:41
You got to know when to hodl em
know when to fold em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your bitcoin
when youre sittin at the table
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:42:32
.... No. In fact it makes perfect sense. Were seeing a surge in popularity for Bitcoin, so it only makes sense that newcomers will ask advice here
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:24
Saw it coming. It went from 16k to 19k very quickly. A price correction/dip was bound to happen
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:26:15
aaaaaaand its gone
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:10:34
TBF, Apple is without a doubt the best at monitoring apps and not allowing junk in their app store, unlike Google Play and amazon. So the fact that one app made it through the cracks isnt that big a deal
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:13:24
This has been posted fucking 10 times today. Enough of this spam. We know
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:08:48
Here in my basement, just bought this, uh, new crypto currency here. Fun to invest up here in the bitcoin price hills. But you know what I like a lot more then bitcoin? KNOWLEDGE!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:45:37
If this was on any other sub, the person would have put /s and all would have been well
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:51:57
Just out of curiosity, why only $1? Are you doing it because you are afraid of the risk, you just want to be able to say you have bitcoin, etc? Even if bitcoin DOUBLES, you would be... a dollar richer. Honestly, I think $10-20 is great for beginners. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:37:31
Then why the fuck was everyone saying it was going to reach 20k before christmas?!?!?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:47:37
Alright, lets not go crazy
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:50:16
Hellllll no. Fuck Coinbase. GDAX for life
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:52:03
Are they made of cheap plastic or are they nice?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:41:00
I mean, I dont think its unusual to ask how many shares someone has if we are speaking about the stock market, so IMO, I hold a similar opinion on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:22:18
Simple: pass a law which forbids anything that drives the value of the dollar down
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:13:44
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:43:16
You could HODL, but realistically you could pay off your mortgage, student loans, etc. It all depends on what youre needs are right now. If you are doing well financially, by all means HODL. But it kills me to see people who are struggling bad, yet have a fortune in Bitcoin, and people still say hold
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:07:25
I mean hes not wrong that whenever anyone shit talks bitcoin, theres an angry mob. But at the same time, I think hes wrong that Bitcoin is as big a gamble as going to Vegas
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:24:00
Im new to bitcoin, but how long do you think it will take for it to go back up to 19k or even just 18? Seems like its been lingering at 16k for a few hours now
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:50:24
Wondering this as well
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:07:09
A) The government will regulate the shit out of Bitcoin to prevent it from ever overtaking the USD. 
B) Whats the fucking point of holding for life? Everybodys gotta sell at some point. Otherwise you will never make any money
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:04:18
I would assume though that its a never ending cycle. Bitcoin goes up, google searches go up. Because google searches go up, bitcoin goes up, and on and on
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:25:20
Im pretty sure it was this one, but I could be wrong
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:34
I was thinking 20k was a pipe dream, but now 25k seems possible
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:54:19
Look, a lot of people here are going to say this: “Of course! Buy and HOLD!!!!”. Honestly, it seems very unstable right now. Dont get me wrong, I dont think its gonna crash, and I also believe its gonna hit 20k before Christmas, but I just dont see investing THAT much right now. Its a big risk. Dont spend any more then you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:21:42
hey its me ur good causes
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:53:01
This is brigading. Dont brigade. It could get you and this sub banned. Just let em be
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:06:01
It just dipped. Went from 12900 to 12860 real quick
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:42:08
A lot of people are making fun of you, but you just doubled your money. Sure, you could have walked a way with more, but dont treat it as a loss. IMHO, I would invest 4k now, and put that other 4k away
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:28:31
Wait how did u lose $20? Did u sell lower then u bought it at?!?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:37:39
Hold. It will spike up. It will spike down. It has ALWAYS come back up. Do NOT panic sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:58:22

Mr GDAX, tear down this wall
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:26:52
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:25:20
Stop. Its only a bubble if you make it a bubble. People selling is the exact reason its going down
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:06:59
Dont fucking do that. No matter how safe bitcoin may seem, you could lose everything in a second. Only put in what you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:03:31
Glad to see new people join the community!

tbf, dot com bust
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:19:19
IMHO, even if it dips a couple thousand, it will come back up in short period of time. Hold
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:37:32
.... How about just getting a job?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:41:22
The message literally explains why....
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:38:13
Wtf? Why would he hold only to sell at an even lower amount?!?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:00:50
Wait till tomorrow to buy. Estimates showing it could reach as low as $9800. And honestly, I would suggest buying more then $5. Maybe $20? You dont have to put in a whole lot and of course you could sell at any time
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:50:16
Based on everything Ive read, mining is pointless unless you put a good chunk of change towards good hardware. TBH youd be better off just buying bitcoin the next time it dips and just hold
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:06
I bought in right before it hit 12k
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:01:45
Honestly, Im new to bitcoin and I dont see why people would prefer Coinbase over GDAX. Its interface is a *little* nicer, and it shows you what your balance is, but thats about it. Everything else about it is trash; huge fees, inaccurate price charts, constantly down, etc. The only other real plus is that you can pay with a credit/debit card and get instant access to funds, but thats about it
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:20:47
Holy fucking shit that guy actually ate his testicle
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:43:01
Buy low, sell high. If the price drops rapidly, or raises quick, don't be afraid, its normal. Don't do something stupid and pull out over a few hundred dollar drop. Also, don't invest a few dollars, its pointless. Start with something like $10 or $20. If you like it, you could add more. And if you don't, you can always pull out. Also, use GDAX, don't use coinbase. Fewer fees
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:05:57
A whole lotta nothing
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:44:13
When did I complain? All I said was, does anyone know when it could go back up. I just wanted to see how long this dip might be for...
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:26:48
TBH I invested very little (only $30) so Im not worried, but it was very entertaining seeing the price skyrocket over the past few days
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:55:25
fucking avoid coinbase like the plague. Use GDAX instead. Takes longer, but fewer fees
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:37:57
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:43:45
My grandma said she heard about Bitcoin through the Big Bang Theory (hey man, whatever gets you started, right?) and wants to dump some money into it. Im gonna get her $20 worth and a metal bitcoin coin off of amazon for Christmas :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:47:19
Honestly, and I will get downvoted into oblivion for this, but your first point is 100% correct. I only started on bitcoin a week ago, but every single piece of advice I got here has been 100% wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:09:26
Buy low, sell high. Same as the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:38
Wow really? /s
Theres been like 15 articles posted about this today alone
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:55:50
I wont lie, I need someone to ELI5 this for me. Im not really familiar with some of the more technical terms as I just started Bitcoin this week
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:12:51
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:04:42
Coinbase locked me out of using a card, so I can only use a bank account for now. So Im on the other side of the spectrum; it will take me a week to buy.
But in any case, as for the projection, that is a very short term estimate. Its still expected to reach 13000 before Christmas IIRC
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:50:58
How many fucking times do we have to repeat ourselves; bitcoin already corrected. Went from 19k to 16k
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:42:54
Maybe yesterday morning. Now it cant seem to stay past 16k...
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:24:20
Bruh, it price corrected a few hours ago. Went from 19k to 16k
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:49:47
You guys are delusional. Bitcoin and other coins are dependent on its popularity, and a growing popularity at that. Bitcoin peaked. People cashed out, the price plummeted, and its over. Stop lying to yourselves and others.
