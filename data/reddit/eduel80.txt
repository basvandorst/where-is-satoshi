@_date: 2018-01-13 20:26:42
Yeah try Monero instead (XMR) and then if you really want bitcoin you can do it on an exchange. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:24:57
sell with someone that doesn't have their hands tied behind their backs. Try   not with an exchange that reports and tattle tales on how YOU can spend YOUR money.

Travel agent here. In the travel industry you can buy an airline ticket with your company clout (like if you were big, such as expedia etc) and within the void period you can "reissue" the ticket. If it's lower... you keep the difference. (same if higher, you lose). This is fine if the buyer knows about it... but
The company I worked for would redeem points (like on credit cards for example). And since the customer is not paying the ticket but an allotment of points they could void and reissue it within the period to make gains. The bank still sees X number of point because like $1-400 is still 20k pts. But if the ticket now costs 300 vs 320 then who gets that money? The books show to the bank and customer the agency paid 320, not 300. 
They were let on by the authorities, and for 2 years this continued before it was moved out of the country it was in and they still do it.
My point is... people do shady shit.. get caught and STILL get away with it!

Yeah they moved 20 BTC. They are an exchange servicing their customer and want it in the next block. If I'm moving 20BTC then I'm not paying low fees to move that much money dude. Of course they paid a higher fee. 
Basically what you said... chose the exchange that best has your interest in mind. The one where your shit was stuck forever or the one that allowed you to be liquid? SMH

Honestly I swear on some show like Forensic Files I saw where this female prison guard was murdered by an inmate and put into the garbage and ended up in the landfill.

With that kind of money we can fly to Geneva (cause you know your private banker and CEO of that bank right?) and meet at the police station and ask for a private booth. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:14:00
Yup, totally possible and great way to learn by doing "penny" trades!
I'd say if you are able to use GDAX get USD deposits from your bank set up. (takes like 5 days) and then you can deposit fiat (usually US dollar) direct to GDAX with NO fees.
I'd then try something easier and more stable like LTC/ETH mainly LTC.
You can do very very low buy / sells or what's better is Market Limit Orders. Read their site on FEES but basically since you're able to add liquidity to the market they drop the fee to -0- on LIMIT orders (be careful to pick the right order, it says LIMIT on the top).
This way you could put in a 0.01 order at 99.99 and a sell order (if you had LTC) at 100.00 and see that it does work and you make 1 penny!
Note: You can do this with Coinbase to feed GDAX instantly. However with that convience comes a price...the fees. You get your LTC/BTC/ETH instantly but you pay a fee to get it then. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:26:36
I personally think the IRS has software already in place to track this it’s just they’re trying to soften the blow to us. This is the first step.  They already have forensic financial software to track bitcoin. It’s inherently easy and built into the currency. 
I have a feeling they are doing this to get things in place for Monero when it takes off.

LTC is everything BTC is an more. Easily replace it and be better. It’s name in brand only that is keeping BTC up.  Same with others like Monero (XMR), that one has issues cause it’s not on like Coinbase.    Imagine if you see it near ETH/LTC on Coinbase? Yeah huge changes!

@_date: 2017-12-04 22:22:06
You have to know what point you invest in. 
Lets say you bought in at 11,500 and you spent $100USD and it goes to 20,000.
20000/11500=1.739   100*1.739=173.90
So $173.90 in gains. That formula help any?
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:49:47
1. make sure address matches exactly. 
2. per your address YOU posted it shows confirmaitons so it's in the blockchain to THAT address YOU posted 100% done no if's or gimmebacks etc.
If you're SURE that address is 100% correct then it's on the exchange you sent it to hand's to post it. 
Had this problem with XMR (Monero) on poloniex. Took them 12 hours to add it to my account. The money was theirs with 100's of confirmations (Monero is 2 min block time) before they finally gave me my credit showing I have it to trade. The price changed drastically by that time and I was screwed.

Oh really now. Tell me how many transactions you verified were from the exchange to a wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:30:19
Yes as You have to establish the base currency you will use. You can use XMR as base on Poloniex that I know of to buy LTC. This allows you to get away from BTC somewhat. But not fully 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:07:42
Wow you really need to rinse off. Like the ocean has less salt.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:43:46
You're pennies (and seeing pennies) in this ecosystem. There are big boys at play here moving massive money. As nother has said you buy alt coins with BTC. So BTC is basically your "money" for the others. The "money" you use now changes in "value" (like any currency  EURO/USD/GBP/JPY does but not this drastic).  So when BTC goes up in value the trade AGAINST those coins also does. So they match. It's a win win! 
If you saw the USD / EURO change in value like the venezuelan bolivar does then you'd see the prices for objects change too. Like Milk/Eggs would all go up in price/down like LTC/ETH does with BTC.

Bitcoin transactions are broadcasted to a “pool” and they sit there and wait for a “miner” to pick them up.
Like walking into a Bank and yelling “I want to move $1 who wants to help me? I’m paying $0.04!” 
The first teller who picks up your transaction puts it in the block chain.   Each block “down the road” is a confirmation.   You got a lot of people in front of you too. (That may pay higher fees to be first)

Had a friend get on GDAX yesterday and was verified within like 20 mins. He bought the coins from ME tho. He's still in the process of the verify bank account phase but can trade crypto to crypto with the current account as it is. 
bittrex and poloniex took weeks for me.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:46:30
Yeah you gotta be patient with it.  Also trade alts for BTC so you’re “always in crypto”.    But yes the point where you wait a second too long or bid the wrong way and the market shoots off you’re done.   And when you’re doing it with 10k that’s a lot to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:34:56
Tried it. It went from 7k to 6 ish like boom an lost my dip chance.  BTC is very fickle and she will leave you in the dust be warned!

Do you use Apple ecosystem? 1Password is the best for this. Total integration into safari on iOS and browsers on Mac windows. EVERY sight should have a password that’s long, complex and unique!

Please be right so I can buy more!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:06:51
Yeah true, the money coming in is not insta buy, but 0 fee.   You have to see if the returns you get from the price increase+fee+insta lock in is better than the actual USD direct to GDAX.
I just setup weekly buys and so every Friday I have more USD to play with!

What about if I trade Litecoin (LTC) for Bitcoin (BTC) and "gain" 1LTC per day that I transfer the LTC out to a wallet. So after 1 month I have 30LTC in that wallet. Now to simplify things lets say it was that way for 1 year. So 30X12 so 360LTC. Is that what I report to IRS that I "gained" 360LTC?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:40:44
Isn’t it odd how it’s always when you’re asleep? Like ✌️they✌️ are able to somehow make the price go down at a certain time when’s less users are here. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:37:58
Do you know of their exchange called GDAX? You can set limit orders (buy / sell offline). Also no fee for USD deposit from bank account!
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:20:31
No wonder it's at ATH! I thought I personally controlled the cyptocurrency market, because every time I sell the price rises. I think it was your fault this time!

@_date: 2017-11-17 14:18:21
They should never even count on it even if it DID happen. Coinbase is like a bank they would find a way to say the other coin is victorious and basically sell the other for profit.

Watch you sell that suver and BOOM it goes up. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:22:42
Yeah I agree say trading is really hard!   I’ve been mainly focusing on the quantity of BTC or like LTC I have.   I set a goal of each day earn 1 LTC “extra” and so far I’m at 2. I then move one that two, to a hardware wallet. I know it’s not much earnings for 3-4hours work that my ✌️day job✌️ can produce, but moving it off I feel helps you not fuck up and sell all capital, have it crash and you penny-less.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:52:16
Never invest more than you can afford.
Always take it as the money you just spent to invest is GONE for good. That way in a loss you’re not committing yourself to financial burden. 
Coinbase is great for newbies.   Now explore their exchange GDAX! (your login works for GDAX as they own it)
There is no fee for putting in from you checking account as pure fiat then using market limit buys to avoid fees! 
The difference is with the fee you lock it in now and the transaction is done on coinbase with GDAX you’re waiting for the funds to be deposited on the exchange and the price can change before you have a chance to buy. It could also drop very low and since you didn’t buy you save money since you’re still in fiat.   It’s a gamble. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:08:36
Please bitcoin I’m trying to sleep :( 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:59:21


No, no, no! Did you even bother to google before you wrote this?  *technicaly* they know **ALL** your bitcoin movements. From the point where you fucking took fiat to the exchange to the point it left the exchange (the exchange will tattle on you btw - they are forced by law to) and give up the wallet ID and any transactions going from your wallet are DUH public!  The Internal Revenue Service is using forensic bitcoin transaction tracing tools for years now.  Pay your taxes if they are due because of gains!  They **will** know if you don't. Now are you keeping it? That's FINE! It's the same thing as buying gold/silver.    Why don't you think they haven't shut cryptos like this down yet? Because it's **EASIER** to track money launderers! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:31:59
Do not try and buy the dip, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth...there is no dip. Then you'll see that it is not the dip that's bought, it is only yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:23:57
Yeah there is a lot of traffic right now. Your fee seems low, but it should clear out. Give it time and if not it will fail and reject to your original wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:47:37
I've set a rebuy at $50 per week. Think thats enough? It's  way less than I should spend but I'm still leery. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:06:20
I was having a problem with it till I realized it’s no different than throwing $1k on an exchange. (As they have the private keys)

@_date: 2017-11-15 15:32:19
No, not on GDAX. I make about 2LTC profit a day. All 0 fees on GDAX.  You have to deposit there too to avoid fees. Coinbase is instabuy but high fee. (For that reason)
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:37:42

@_date: 2017-11-07 00:10:48
Fuk no. Thats why I want them to credit them to my wallet. I want to decide when / if to sell them they're MINE.  ( guess if they're the exchanges tho ... they beg to differ?)
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:16:54
This might have an effect on the price right now. Nice timing they did on the update.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:51:58
So will this make the price go up even more because “they can’t have it”?
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:18:35
No I personally control the cryptocurrency market because every time I sell, the price rises and I’ll just sell at $10,000.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:23:38
Yeah vast as in 90%+ I’d say.   Tons of posts I read about it are people being really frakin stupid 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:31:53

We’re not gdax support however. Probably best to post in @_date: 2017-11-05 12:30:11
Trading/withdrawals are suspended because of replay for a couple days.
They say of course you can send in coins. Cause YOU can get replayed on. But they won’t send coins out, cause THEY could get replays ��
Trezor said they are ready and after after the fork they will update to allow the coin split.   I suspect most wallets will. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:57:19
200? Jesus has bitcoin too I bet!
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:38:08

Coinbase is GDAX. It’s their exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:39:04
Not that I would do this but what if you go to like a personal wallet then send the money from there to the site? Does that work? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:45:58
Yeah since you asked. It’s disturbing.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:38:08
No, thank you for hopefully searching befor you post. Now, forgive me, but I’m on to call the other 200 posts on the same topic idiots for not searching.

Or to get your shit stolen. Best to refer back to the wallets main page. Like trezor for their own home page to restore wallet. Etc 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:22:45
Maybe you can try another exchange like Bittrex or Poloniex? Not sure if they have age things. 
Or just buy and HODL till 18! lol

Or he wants you to buy and then the price drops.

It got the reddit hug of death I think.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:29:36

The crypto was made so you could be your own bank. Get your private keys in your own wallet! Trust no one!

This totally. Tried to help someone the other day do it with no fee checking account on GDAX
They stopped on step one at Coinbase and bought with A check and then send me a message: why did I get charged fees?
I said why did you buy first and not ask me why it was charging a fee? Also Coinbase not GDAX and they all are like “oh that’s right I forgot”.
Seems like too complicated for most.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:58:55
Are you talking about the last hour? Where it makes two mountains at bout 5m on GDAX? (New to this, still learning!)

Didn't banks used to be able to do this and now have regulations to prevent it?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:46:02
No, actually it doesn't by a long shot. And the Vega has way less heat/power consumption. AND you pay less for the price as Nvidia is extremely over priced for what they do. Don't care what website you link blah blah, actually get the card and do the hashes and you will see.
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:20:59

So what do you keep on the exchange to trade with? 10k? 50k?
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:25:50
Those QR codes on the wall. �� 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:31:40
Fees for what? Trading?   Make sure you understand what fee you’re getting hit with. If it’s trading then it should be small.  Like 20 or so cents on a $100 ish.

To answer your question on a ELI5: Cryptocurrencies use "blockchain" tech to put the transactions on a public ledger. Miners basically are just "confirming" that ledger. Like you walking into the bank and saying "send John X" and the teller saying "ok it's done and recorded on the ledger, pay me x to do that too". The "teller" is the "miner".  Nothing more to it. Just maintaining that ledger and getting paid to do the work! 
Great 30min video [here]( He will explain what miners do very clearly. Remember simply: They "maintain" the ledger and that's what gets them paid. 
Another 5 min more video [here]( on how strong the encryption really is for the system. 
**Honestly** this question has been asked every day for weeks on end. Most people have explained it better in posts that can be found by searching the specific subreddit.

@_date: 2017-11-02 17:16:19
Well if you are in a region where you can use GDAX then you can do "limit" orders for -0- fees. I literally put in a buy at 6000.00 and sell at 6000.01 and make profit. It's maker/taker and they have -0- maker fee! It's AWESOME!
Now with that being said the parent company is Coinbase. So prolly gonna get flak for this but so far they have been very good to me with any issues.

"confirmations" is just the block chain expanding and the longest one is the winner, so they like "6" as their number before the chain coudln't be split somewhere else. *rolles eyes* cause you really only need 1!

How do you people deal with these fees on trades? GDAX is the only one I could possibly make a profit off of. ... 25% per trade? Fuck off!
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:14:35
I doubt they are going to be fully forthcoming with what they are doing / about to do.
The entire community flip flopped on this OVERNIGHT! It’s very odd!
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:26:07
Um. No. More like 2 more blocks. �� 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:29:40
Yeah and then the change in USD to BTC ratio makes your $0.50 now $7.50.

Now the problem is people are anticipating this. And it might end badly. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:11:37
And they are trying to stop it with net neutrality!
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:43:00
Oh it will not, Coinbase only sent that email to cause FUD for more profits. ��

Ok. This company is based out of Las Vegas USA?
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:49:31
Not withdrawals!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:07:26
Ok I thought it was a swing at first. For you know “eating out”.  Not literally! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:18:49
How did you buy? If it's on coinbase they can take a long time for ACH to clear, if it's a credit card it's much faster but higher fee.
Tip: Go into GDAX (their exchange your credentials for coinbase work there too) and then DEPOSIT fiat (USD/EURO etc) to the exchange then use limit orders to buy. There is no fee. Now you have to wait for the USD to be placed onto GDAX just like you had to wait for the BTC and at the same time the price rises and falls. So thats the "price you pay for no fee".
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:03:28
Or change the alpha codes on the image and you can see the redeem key on the reverse. I hope you haven't loaded that yet.     ok kidding but would be bad if that were true!

Yeah I did dearest search for that same response you just gave me and NADA so I appreciate it. Thanks!

Oh website did that? Nice. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:22:00
Oh and don’t send coins for a bit after the fork! There is no replay protection so someone can replay your message on the other chain and spend your coins! 
This is why they are waiting to send withdrawals out of Coinbase because you would be able to replay their withdrawal from Coinbase to you on the other chain! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:30:39
Yeah then it falls and you’re like “fuck”.   It works both ways.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:43:49
I keep reading one should never consider holding coins on an exchange as ✌️safe✌️ because they have the private keys!
Hardware wallet, cold storage wallet, etc. is the way to go from what I can gather.

KBOI and KIDO

Hahah right?   Partner last night finally got his Coinbase deposit when he bought it at 6300 and pain in like 10k and then as soon as it hit 7299 he took it out. Like blew my mind. 
He’s new. I told him “yeah you made over $500, but you probably would stand to make more”.
Is his eyes that’s return was any more than he would get as gambler and won’t buy more.    Oh well... it’s his money. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:54:02

I do believe you are correct and think we can use [Occam's razor]( to come to that hypothesis.

Withdrawals? Hmm? Nope!
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:29:40
Yeah, each buy and sell you give a part to the exchange. Oh unless it’s on GDAX and you are a limit order and there is no fees.   (Or you trade so much (200k BTC in trades I think?) you get free taker fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:09:37
Same as you here.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:37:21
Ah I wondered if that was what was going on. Coinbase is stating they have problems with their service but my transaction is sitting at 1. Very slow and odd!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:20:55
Wallstreet hasn’t even just glanced our way. The money here isn’t Wallstreet.   Once futures are in play in a couple weeks it will be a calm sea :( 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:08:09
Um your Coinbase credentials ARE your GDAX. I’m not sure why you would have to verify on GDAX if you are on Coinbase.
Again Coinbase logins = GDAX
They are the same company.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:38:26
I think he understands it.
I think he understands it **extremely well** and this is a show. 
They don't want to loose what they have in fees and the like. That's what this jeopardizes to them. Payment card industry wants to save the precious transaction fees **AND** be able to snoop on what you spend your money on AND how much you have!
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:22:07
Yeah other sights give you the block chain too. They aren’t “the one” to use.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:15:27
Till their servers go down and you can't check the price or get any alarms/updates. Probably best to set alarms with many different apps.

I read “malware / virus” and immediately thought “XMR Miner”’.   Fuck they not gonna write viruses to delete / steal data anymore, just your fucking cpu power! Yeah  should be a crime!    (Punishment should be a heavy Fee in the form of BTC ��)
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:29:08
I’m new, and bad at math. If I put in $50 and have $1000 after I day trade that’s like telling them 1900% increase.  If that’s right then holy crap! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:01:34
On a couple TA forums they say it’s had it’s “double hump” due to the crap and now this is a sign of a bear market.  
Problem I see with that is they’re basing their answer on years of STOCK market research.   crypto is not the stock market and it’s a different beast.   Right now with the hype if it drops to 6k I think people will eat it up 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:19:30
Omg I was able to understand the website and love how you did it in there.   Muuuuuuuch. Better! �� 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:46:55
Yes, and the Trezor said they would also help with the fork. So if you have one of those wallets you can stick it there too. (That’s what I’m doing).
Coinbase = bank mentality.   They are in it for a profit and fuck you.
They will label the chain with the most proof of work being he victor.  That’s not how this works! THEY don’t get to decide. The minors who mine the work will mine the most popular/profit chain and the victor will be named by the public! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:25:52
Yeah use GDAX.   They are owned by Coinbase.   Go to GDAX.com and sign in with your Coinbase login and the “deposit” your coins with the deposit button and then “withdraw” via the button right next to deposit and send to your Trezor address.    That way there are no fees with GDAX! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:00:55
Do exchanges get all pissy with you moving a bit between them? I always moved to a private wallet then to them... does it matter?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:51:05
If you can get into GDAX (it’s Coinbase’s exchange) then you can deposit fiat (USD/Euro) from your bank account (takes a bit) and then you can limit buy coin with your fiat as limit buys have no fee! (You wait for the price to hit that limit, so 1 penny off of current or lower) 
Same as buying from Coinbase then with a checking account only it’s not buying the coins RIGHT THEN it’s giving you the fiat in the exchange to trade yourself.    You save the fee BUT you are waiting for the money to clear your bank to them the price could change. Up OR down. So it’s a gamble. 
Weekly deposits to GDAX of like x amount would work as “buys” so you have a deposit coming in each week is what I do. And I do it like $98 this week $94 next $99 after (varying amounts to check the deposits) as they take a bit to go in and then you can see what deposit went in.   ACH checks can take a long time to clear! It’s stupid 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:32:07
I'm doing just fine [here]( after about 15 days mining the coin called monero (XMR). Already put some of it on Poloniex and it's now litecoin. (But if I would have just left it as XMR it would have been worth WAaaay more!!!)
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:08:43
I’m not buying it.     The entire community was **all** about keeping your coins in your own wallet till Coinbase released a statement saying they will honor both coins blah blah.
We’re talking potentially millions of dollars here and I think they’re gonna pull some shit.   It seems to easy.  “Yes yes out all your coins in one basket where we control the keys and decide for YOU what BTC and B2X really are!
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:04:25
Yah you're right, but also they are disabling withdraws on both GDAX and COINBASE at the same time. They're the same company. They even sent out an email from both companies with the same text in there only the FROM was different. i.e GDAX or CB.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:29:45
12k. Yeah it’s going to be a wild week this night!
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:55:28
So what not the big one? Polo, Bitt Rex/stamp GDAX I can’t remember them all. They all reputable now?

That or polar opposites as Gnome Alaska.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:50:14
Yeah that’s the trend I can see from the charts. They are like feuding brothers in a tug of war. One slips and the other moves with him only to move it back.   It’s so cool to watch.

I love trading stoned too. Nothing like a good dab then hitting the exchange for some light trading. It's like a roller coaster of fun!

Lol the shills in this thread are hilarious with the downvotes �� I put one back for you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:17:37
I have a feeling there is a reason why they haven't started taking it sooner. With overstock taking it, you would think it's a no brainer. There has to be a catch, and it's probably due to transaction fees on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:23:15
I personally think it's going to do that tonight easy as hell. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:03:12
There is always someone that has nothing to do better with their time then stick a knife in someones back.  **And twist**

@_date: 2017-11-16 00:28:55
If you paid like 0.83822 BTC for the item and you get refunded 0.83822 usually. Like online shops and stuff that I've dealt with. But they also might give you like that minus x in fees to send it back. Depends on their policy. In bitcoin there are no "refunds" per say just money moving back and forth. So they would just transmit back to the wallet it came from. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:14:15
Yah no shit. Mine took 12 hours for the first confirm. The shitstorm is over with.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:53:17
Yeah money burns though some fast too when they get it!  Friend sold a house he bought on a short sale. Ended up with 60k left over.  He should have invested it.  Burnt.it.all.  It’s all gone on a car/women.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:24:35
Have you seen the posts of the "predictions"? So far most of them have come true.. Prices, volumes, it could be educated guesses but they get really scary when it talks about bitcoin being the "ruin" of our society. 
So with that said... If it dropped to 8k now after 10k I'm buying even more if it goes lower! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:14:58
CAN'T BUY TOO!
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:51:33
There is some chat on ITC that there is a bug in B2X code, terrible bug and that’s why they stopped it.   So if it does continue people are fucked over there.

I thought it was a Microsoft convention at first.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:50:18

Now you know your work is worth it ;) he users hugged you to death!
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:30:35
For BTC. If you mine XMR (it's ASIC resistant) you will get much better returns. Or hell even ETH.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:33:29
Hah buying the dip... You know what it was like seeing the news of the tether hack and then BTC dropping like that? I think a lot of people had a heart attack. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:08:41
Ok GDAX. Thank you for sending this blog update to all your users in email so in turn driving up the price even more, and then it will fall and I can buy even more BTC from you. :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:25:27
Do you get buying fees for this on coinbase? 
If so then you can you put the money on GDAX with bank account and market limit order (0 fees that way)
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:52:30
*always* a good chance to buy if you just do $100/week.

Well the old Buy was at 6700 :( but I got in a few at 5800 ish. And trading 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:08:09
So, develop a computer ASIC that is able to mine in, oh 2 mins. Don't release it, but perfect it. Have it down to a science then build enough miners to be able to hash it very quickly. Could the system be gamed this way? I know I'm exaggerating on some parts, but humor me. I forgot to buy this morning :( and feelig depressed lol
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:15:41
Only thing that scare me is net neutrality.  Basically government also saying “no” to transmitting data of certain types thus neutering the bull. Yeah yes not gonna crash like your friends Yahoo. It’s just gong to *disappear*.      Let’s hope that doesn’t happen.

Depends on who you talk to.

I’m trying to see the buy walls but I’m failing here.   What price point? It all looks smooth to me.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:31:19
YOU are over 18, so YOU can deposit fiat into GDAX (it's coinbases exchange).
also see here 
If you can get into GDAX (it’s Coinbase’s exchange) then you can deposit fiat (USD/Euro) from your bank account (takes a bit) and then you can limit buy coin with your fiat as limit buys have no fee! (You wait for the price to hit that limit, so 1 penny off of current or lower)
Same as buying from Coinbase then with a checking account only it’s not buying the coins RIGHT THEN it’s giving you the fiat in the exchange to trade yourself. You save the fee BUT you are waiting for the money to clear your bank to them the price could change. Up OR down. So it’s a gamble.
Weekly deposits to GDAX of like x amount would work as “buys” so you have a deposit coming in each week is what I do. And I do it like $98 this week $94 next $99 after (varying amounts to check the deposits) as they take a bit to go in and then you can see what deposit went in. ACH checks can take a long time to clear! It’s stupid
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:42:13
That’s not the highest level in any way close. It has to be higher than that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:37:40

Check how fast the blocks are growing. Did mine the other night but miners switched to “that other coin” and I had been stuck for about 13 hours. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:07:04
Yah unless I get distracted like today for about 10 seconds and should have just done a taker fee and quit. Had to wait 3 hours for the coin I'm doing to recover. /sigh $lifeofadaytrader
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:11:24
I'm doing XMR mining and it seems ~ok. Mainly for fun as a hobby. Protip: Make sure mgt knows you're doing this!! be careful about doing that at work. You're *stealing* power.  I know it sounds pedantic but lets say they (your work) found a USB powered raspberry pi laying around and wondered what it was? You could also be targeted for giving away company secrets. You may just be a janitor for all we know but that doesn't mean you can't still take company secrets. Janitors are the best for that! After all they don't know it's not a disguised recording device. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:32:32

yeah round numbers are psychological barriers. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:25:17
Yeah and just wait till you learn about the features of Monero (XMR) that makes banks worst fears possible. LTC has Confidential translations (CT) on the way just like XMR and hopefully BTC too. With lightning network it’s going to hopefully put pressure on Visa/MC mobsters.

I personally control the crypto currency market. Ever time I sell the price rises. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:18:15
Why was it set at that time though?
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:19:48
Correct. Get a hardware wallet if you can in the short time. Trezor said they will support it like Coinbase has only YOU control the keys.
Now they said t make take time 2-3 days to get the stuff done to be able to send your coins.   Just like Coinbase! And people are saying that you will have to wait for Trezor.   Well you gonna wait for Coinbase too cause they are suspending withdrawals for a couple days.
THERE DOING THE SAME THING.  Only if let’s say B2X is taking off more they want to label that as BTC! Totally wrong and acting like a bank! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:44:39
Coinbase lets me do $7500. Did you ask for an increase?
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:06:30
I'm kinda new here... I saw a post the other week about James Lopp saying "this replay protection ain't going to write itself". Is he talking about B2X? So James is FOR or WITH the B2X? I'm confused.
Link for the remark 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:43:36
Yeah. It’s just a program that runs like any other. Command prompt is best because you control it and SHOULD compile it from source. If on Windows you can use the PGP keys he listed to verify it but still rather be in control. You don’t want someone slippping in some cpu cycles and stealing your hash or worse. 
  “[Mining]( is a slang term for basically finding the hash for the transactions for the blocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:25:23
Check out Monero (XMR) and the rich list it has.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:46:36
OR it IS you and you sell every time I do and it just looks like me! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:38:10
So with %.25 fee what are we talking here? If you did $1k USD are they charging you $2.50? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:07:57
Damn I can't wait till these things that can do AES encryption are cheaper. Will be able to mine XMR much more easily then.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:11:15
I was playing with LTC/BTC trading and Poloniex has it like a couple higher or lower than GAXD almost always. But never $100.

@_date: 2017-11-18 16:51:45
Based on the countless times I’ve seen people complain on here “he beat me up for my codes” so yeah... nope. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:30:51
I think since it has the company name in there it WOULD be an issue.  How much are we taking about different here? 
Cause my checking account lets me put in $7500/week are you needing more than this?
If so....(you fucking whale lol) You can do bank wires for $10 fee if you need to do more than $7500.

What about LTC
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:23:17
It hit 5800 and I said shut up and take my fucking money!
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:26:17
Yeah that’s a double hump if I didn’t know better. Best of luck lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:07:58
I have both. I like the Trezor more, due to it's method of inputting the security code.  I like the ledger for the way it adopts more coins. (that's the ONLY thing I like about it). The input of the code is way clunkie vs the Trezor.   Do you only deal with the few that the Trezor works with? Then I'd get that. If you work with many that it doesn't support but Ledger does... I'd get that.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:17:19
would have to be able to crack the method they use... is it sha256 or higher? yeah if so good luck 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:17:03
Yeah it’s not them it’s entire damn BTC Network is low on hash lower right now. Everyone’s switching to BTH rofl �� 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:27:06
Doing the 3 min auto process? His images also were really shitty and on a 3mp camera on the pc.   I donno what to tell you but try another camera and location? Make sure your face matches your ID. He had a beard and glasses at the time of his ID pic and so he shaved and wore glasses for my help to make sure he matched the ID pic.  I know lots of hoops but you’re playing with potentially tons of money here. 
Check out Kraken’s ID page they give nice clear instructions and you can apply that elsewhere (I don’t like their exchange personally , and I’m only saying GDAX for no limit but fees but Poloniex is best IF you trade more than 25k BTC a mo. That’s via you not your profit lol) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:42:13
Yeah that would make it priceless. It would shoot on external exchanges to the easterners still able to use it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:16:49
They updated their blog on GDAX and it's not happening. They "suspect it might" but it would take a lot. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:15:16
As in saying “we can now reverse hash?”      Ooh my that.would.be.bery.bad.

Lots of people have money they just don’t throw it around.  Like Next door neighbor has about $70k in his checking account. 
We bank at the same bank and I thought his statement was mine when it came to my house. I gave it back to him no worries.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:25:12
You can get your daily changed. Same with your deposits. 25,000,000 is the last “limit” I’ve seen but there is higher with them. If you have money those options start to “appear” for you.

Yah and sell orders. Got burnt by that once. Thought it might sell at X and it was just a few pennies below or it would have sold and the item dropped heavily. It came back up but not in the time I needed :(
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:42:31
Yeah no clue there. Hopefully you get your BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:53:30
Maybe [this propaganda]( send out by Coinbase/GDAX would have a part in it?
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:12:13
I'm really close to buying an Antminer L3+ just for litecoin as I like it so much. It's just so freaking fast of a coin and have no idea why it hasn't taken over BTC other than the fact of true hard core name BTC has.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:09:03
So you don’t trade on the exchange? I’ve been making 1LTC per day that I’ve been throwing to a hardware wallet. Rest is in Fiat/BTC trades 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:46:26
Yup, it’s like a zit. Just needs time to work to a head then POP!
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:45:31
How’d you tell? Not sure what gave it away.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:05:53
Oh how upside down. Sorry!
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:42:51
To figure it out make a miner. Try supportxmr.com that’s who I use as you see I’ve been paid once already from them and it worked great.   That website has directions to setup a miner using your home PC.
You asked if it would be worth it? It may or may not be but for me it’s something fun to do as a hobby and I’ll eventually forget about the Montero in the wallet and it will just appreciate in value
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:09:38
It’s all over this sub and also YouTube.  Like 4-5 posts an hour just like your question.

True he can. But he also hasn’t been buyin and selling these *very* profitable humps.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:17:02
What gets me is my sell orders go every night and I’m feeling like slime cause someone else is losing money.  It’s such an odd feeling.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:20:33
Can't take this "store of wealth" silver oz coin worth $16USD right now down to overstock and redeem it and use it to buy something.  No you have to go to the silver guy and trade him for fiat.
But the bitcoin you sure can ;) Yes you can do it on an exchange but there it's "not having to leave the house" type of ease and that is what will help the store of value. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:19
Easily 50k. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:35:28
Wait, you left your money on the exchange?! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:12:57
OH that's hilarious! Can't wait till it's higher and this starts!
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:26:05
Strangely odd how on coinbase BTC/ETH/LTC all dropped by huge amounts at the same time. Like falling off a cliff!
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:06:47
Yeah mine is same way? They took my low fee transaction and I thought ok illl do tbis one.    Almost  24hrs!
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:58:25
So then it goes up by 1000's and then people sell. This is why it moves! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:16:13

@_date: 2017-11-15 22:28:42
Check out mining for Monero (XMR) then as bitcoin is too high a difficulty right now you probably won't make anything trying to mine it. With Monero you may only make $0.50 the entire day but if the hotel is paying for power, hell yes!  What kind of CPU? Got at least 2gig ram on a video card in it? If so run XMR Stak either AMD/Nvidia.   Right now AMD cards are kicking the ass out of XMR hash. With Nvidia you can still do it, but it's lackluster in comparison. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:49:57
That’s what I feel, but they All seem to use BTC as the currency and if it goes up or down vs USD/EUR etc then the alts price fucks too. It’s a pain. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:48:53
Oh no I know it is.   But they made their bed.   You can’t just do that to people (banks freezing your funds etc).  
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:51:25
Very new to this.. can you go on?   I only really use GDAX market limit as the fees on the others scare the hell out of me.
What is happening? Are people buying into it to make it go up and hope it crashes??
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:11:06
Right, very odd what they’re doing. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:12:24

I love Blockfolio for this. And CryptoPro for my Apple Watch face to watch the price.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:11:17
So it's the exchange that is accepting my BTC that's causing me to have a higher fee because the addy that they give me isn't Segwit? If true...OMG this is such horse shit! Exchanges need to be on this!

So patience is the key here? Just set a lower buy order and hope it gets filled?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:31:00
The whole coin is just a number. It's pure psychological. You have bitcoin when you have even a fraction. 
You can have more of the fractions in the coin to "spend" than the number of atoms there are of gold, on this planet. (including the ones that haven't been mined)
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:32:07

Who knows.  We can’t predict the future. However Coinbase sending the email out hours before it was supposed to happen was irresponsible and caused a huge set of FUD. They’re driving the price with it. So it could fall.

You missed my point too. I was right :) and I think so about the 6k too.   So hop on my luck dick, friend. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:48:20
Like they had it almost pre-written 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:27:13
It broke 6000 and started going up again and I’m like “Bitch, can I get a sec for a god damn cigarette or we gonna do this 6100 shit right now?”
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:26:10
I bought a Trezor with 1 day shipping to get it sooner and it's the best thing I did to keep my BTC safe. It also works with LTC off of the same site so I've been branching out to that too. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:57:39
Yeah I’m having issues getting mine verified too. It’s like
 “Please take my money?”  
“Oh hang on you’re squinting in your photo can you send another?”
Yeah... I’ll send another (like 5th) and it’s odd things they’re finding “wrong” with the pic each time. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:34:21
Doesn’t mean they have to.
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:12:23
I just buy $50 a week. Doesn’t matter the price. Then I don’t worry and when it hits the moon I’ll have some fun!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:31:40
Yeah I called for 8k and got laughed off the stage. Here we are close to 6k! 
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:31:25
Oh crap what storm?
@_date: 2018-11-04 03:57:57
They’re mad because they have possibly lost their money due to being misinformed most likely not because of “dirty money”. ��
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:53:59
I’m not good at this but isn’t this what simplefx is? You can do it with LTC or BTC or FIAT? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:01:05
Ok I’ve been doing this now all day with BTC to ETH on gdax with limit so no fee.
I’ve gotten from .07 BTC to now .11 BTC and so I have had to made gains but I really don’t know where unless it’s the little shit that adds up.
I’ll put buys in the lows and sells in the high at the same time and go then cook some food and check on it and they BOTH sell! So I get profit from both, but then it took off and I was stuck in BTC and there went more profits! Oh well that’s he “game”. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:43:32
And you can get rich off it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:51:32
Yeah and anyone who steals that thumb drive, too tho. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:45:43
I got on kraken and Poloniex within 3 days this week. Still won’t use them as their fees are crazy for GDAX not having any limit order fees.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:58:43
I understand you don’t want to pay for a wallet but if you are spending $1000’s on one purchase of BTC then a $99 hardware wallet should be no question. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:29:58
No we want the heat. We want it to survive like it did before then bring it on! And if it does they’re fucked.
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:30:09
They integrate with “MetaTrader 4” as well. Really really slick software. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:33:07
Yeah when it’s low I’ll buy and never really sell lol

This Friday is payday for most schedules. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:40:12
Oh hell yes, but on gdax. I just figured out how to do it and shooting myself in the foot over fees. Well you don’t get to “play” with the money right away either but you save on fees. So it’s a toss up. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:36:43
Yeah great at making the rich stay rich. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:25:22
No, bitcoin does not give you privacy. It’s a public blockchain. For privacy use something like Monero. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:38:24
I'm not over confident, I'm just a realist. How about 6k now instead?
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:00:28
How do we see when they switch?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:15:19
Hmm little early with that I think..
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:45:04
Kinda funny to run to gold when your USD is crashing at the same time. Better to run to crypto. Not sure why XAU-USD is any better than a BTC-USD then. People above don't remember bitcoin is deflationary!
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:10:19
TWELVE? Umm I’m in the fucking wrong business!
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:52:11
If you were to never take it back to USD? Does that matter? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:30:37
Ok thank you for the info! I bought this one below to see how it was:
[Crypto Pro: Bitcoin Ticker by Samuel Laska](
I change the settings to mirror what you did in your app that you found. You can see [here](
Both apps have some great functionality I wish I could combine them both in the one!
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:12:40
Ok I don’t see an option to move them to BTC tho do I have to take out?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:27:23
Right you could set it so low that if it doesn’t go thought it just falls back to the original wallet and try again then with a little bit more? You can’t lose your transactions can you?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:05:39
Ok so your saying get your friends, sisters, cousins with extra laptops sitting around doing nothing to jump on the net and just run a blank wallet? (I’m new here but have about 20 laptops that all work from school in the barn I could turn on lol) 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:47:00
Your buying the BTC on the DXY. Check the DXY chart vs BTC (overlay tem). 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:31:01
Can this ✌️hardware wallet✌️ run out of battery? Thusly losing your BTC? (New here)
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:27:59
Yeah not sure why I was downvoted when I Basically agree with you. Or maybe that’s cuz I said BTC is shit for card payments and hurt a fanboys feelings lol. 
Yeah I agree in order to compete with visa you’ll have to have instantaneous transfers and such.   Some day we may evolve! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:15:49
Sorry it was me. I personally control the cryptocurrency market because every time I sell, the price rises.
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:32:52
The best ones are in the comments. Omg I laughed out loud at work and now can’t explain how funny this is.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:51:32
Or have sex with men, if you're a man. Or buy pot. But god damn you could have a bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:53:15
Yes and they own GDAX and if you limit trade it’s free no fees. Also no fees to put into heir exchange and come back. (Coinbase &lt;&gt; GDAX).
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:47:40
My gold and silver place will acid test for free. Mainly cuz he “likes to watch it bubble” lol
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:58:48
Going to try.. first time sending to another person. Not too sure on how much fee to put?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:28:07
What app are you viewing this with?
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:02:53
This would make me so happy!
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:49:32
I trade on the lows and highs with my coins. Should I take it out every single night before bed or something?
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:32:48
High as shit and it looks like a bottle rocket, no?
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:21:41
So if I want to use the Trenzor instead of Electrum do I transfer my BTC from one to the other? Then if so there are fees too?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:22:33
Ok and since its wallet to wallet you should be able to do it on slow times with lower fees?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:48:27
I know. I should have when it was like 5700 ish I was just afraid and here it's at 6120 and I'm getting my gun out to shoot my own foot off!
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:31:43
Well and even if it's a peak that week it won't be next week.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:50:52
Well we use Apple and we have airdrop and so it’s all built in. Good luck on your quest! 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:39:55
Ok yeah to GET the USD onto Coinbase? Has to be coin I thought 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:50:43
That’s when it goes up and you’re like “wow well glad I HODL”
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:20:57
Walls like this?
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:02:27
Ok I’m trying it. Crossing my fingers!
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:39:08
Why does his name come up every other link in this sub? (I’m new here)
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:07:28
Have you heard of Bitmex? Similar to your situation I think. They operate out of Republic of Seychelles. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:31:19
Kind of shit? It’s like really bad as far as fast transactions and such right? Like litecoin would make more sense as far as coffee shops and stuff?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:04:25
Oh ok so that’s like me doing $100 per week ignoring the current price and still buying?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:21:24
Does size of transaction matter? Or can we do a few small ones to keep the node ahead and fuck these assholes causing problems? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:44:45
Can you give an easy way to do this? I'm coming up confused as hell
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:59:11
Ok I thought it was ETH hard fork tomorrow but they ALL seem to be behaving like big brother BTC 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:03:02
Oh shit I hope it does exactly that!!! Then I can get more at a discounted price. ������
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:10:44
I put it back in at 5599.99. If it doesn’t dip that low that’s fine I can find another dip to pick up at. Just doing it for fun with a couple grand I had saved up and wanted to learn day trading. With gdax and market limit orders there are no fees.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:57:29
So to go deeper... we don’t know who created BTC? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:37:03
Aww so let’s say I put nana in the safety deposit box. And the words on paper in another.   You have access from both areas? One as a backup?
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:48:41
Ok and for USA can you say a couple to try? Can you just do like $25 on each one to try and play the small game? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:56:03
How do you see what to bid on? Does it give a estimation? I’m really new to this and this seems like a sweet tool! Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:56:49
I’m cool with that. I sold at 5900, gonna let that shit cool down again. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:58:50
Yeah, newbie learning lesson. I’m just not good with tall these exchange sites. They all work like coinbase? Give money get BTC?
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:44:12
What am I doing? Scooping up the corn you just sold me cheap as hell! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:51:08
So is this $3.00 fee from Coinbase too high on $488usd worth of BTC transfer? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:40:21
Putin spending his *currency* on *something*... what an *idiot*.

So nice story. I agree about your comment for tips. So as per the rule above.
Please post your Bitcoin address so we can send a tip. ;)

Wish I could find out how to add lite coin to it though. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:33:21
Some apps also can display things inside other faces like “stocks” app can display bitcoin :) right inside the modular watch face on the watch. You don’t even need an extra out everything comes ready to watch the price now only caveat it comes from yahoo finance.
If you like other places for the price you’ll need to use the other apps
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:42:23
How do I do this with my 401k?
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:48:31
I don’t even know how you’d do it without doing it in pure cash fiat in person. No credit card/check/is safe from chargeback except crypto right?
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:42:15
Oh ok well can’t you email yourself the addy?
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:29:39
Yeah so I think the downvotes should have told you to go long. Did you? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:01:21
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:51:49
It’s more in line with gold and gold is bigger too!
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:06:49
See that’s what I’m trying to do with GDAX (I’d do the others but they seem to be taking FOREVER to “verify” my identity) and playing with the small dips and trying to figure this out. So far it’s falling before I have a chance to sell or up before I can buy it. It’s like it’s laggy.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:52:15
And that’s to your own wallet? Like “Electrum”?
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:25:42
I personally control the cryptocurrency market because every time I sell, the price rises.
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:53:48
I’m trying to come up with a retort of something as: an animal that grows up in the wild and survives ferocious predators will be on the top.
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:52:45
Um explain how 0.25% per trade is low? 
It’s expensive vs GDAX
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:11:30
TA? ( I don’t think tits and ass? Lol) 
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:48:58
Ohh hah, sorry the 420 has me off 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:22:01
Firmware updates have to be signed and would be instantly rejected if not valid.
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:06:35
How much was the nano you got? I've seen the price going up.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:35:09
I'm really really new to this so I bought in and have been trying to do the "limit" buys on GDAX for no fees. Selling when it peak and buying in valley. I know it's not a lot of money (maybe $5 in 2 days lol) but I'm learning.   
So when you say walls of 500 and 1000? Does that mean the price hike?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:13:32
Ok even better! I love the option, but how do they stay in business that way? Or not everyone knows?
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:25:05
Yeah day trading lll
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:29:31
I thought they way people were talkng about how good Kraken and Poloniex were that they would outshine GDAX but so far it’s just not the case in my view. 
Had no customer service issues yet though. **crosses fingers**
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:09:02
So we’re asking you to now; post your wallet addy for some donations! And keep up the good work!
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:30:48
Ahem I prefer $9999.99 thank you very much.
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:02:40
So on the "gains and losses stuff". How much do you have to gain before you pay uncle sam? Or is it on all what you did?
I know trading up/down then withdrawing and you have more money you report the gains but if you buy something for X dollars (into exchange for BTC output to wallet) and it appreciates in value (not in the exchange but in the wallet) how the hell can they tax that?
Like lets say I put into an exchange $50.00USD on 1/1/17 and "traded" the USD for BTC then moved it to a wallet. Now being that it's in the wallet for the entire year and it went up in price I have still only $50.00USD spent into the exchange and the bitcoins are moved to a hardware wallet. The price is double what it was. Do I pay taxes on that amount? Or since it's on a hardware wallet do they still see gains since it's not in an exchange? 
I'm not trying to pull a fast one here. I want to pay taxes where it's due but this doesn't make sense! I can see if I put X USD into an exchange and it increased and I took that X back as USD. 
Does uncle sam see the X bitcoins on my hardware wallet and say "well you bought it for X on this day and it's now X on tax day, pay up". 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:17:14
Put it in an exchange then you can buy and sell and not worry?
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:13:34
I forgot to put in a buy order.   *shoots foot*
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:39:37
$100 little gadgets lol 
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:02:21
Yeah mempool is really big right now per the other chat areas so I bet it will clear when it calms down. 
Just an opinion though!
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:07:31
Slaves build the pyramids!
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:31:11
So do you make a limit order just past the wall hoping it will Gall and you get in?
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:17:26
So I was right? I was afraid it would cause a problem with the low fee but I guess it wouldn’t confirm eventually?
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:37:31
When it falls we’re gonna scooooop that load up! 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:39:32
And my roommate gives the comment “they only look at the exchanges if you give them reason to”
And that’s the kind of mentality that lands you in trouble with the IRS! 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:06:54
Ok I just tried this and it doesn’t for me. Are you in GDAX and then press deposit?
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:00:50
This right here is exactly what I feel proper response would be to this.
Both sides are corrupt, we need the shit on everybody!  
And with our Cryptocurrency comes the way to fund freedom!
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:48:38
Yeah I am new to this but I wanted to send some to someone and so I went to  and calculated the per byte cost, was like “266 bytes” so I did 266x 0.0000004 and put that in for my fee.
The wallet said low fee but it confirmed in a shorter time than Coinbase’s exorbitantly high fee did!!! 
I guess I don’t get fees yet. How come the app said low fee when it confirmed faster than one with 4times that?
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:43:48
So get grandmas lappy and boot er up? Will do! 
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:09:09
Ok yeah it’s those big graphs all peaking to a center point usually red blow and green above?  
That would make sense. And if I change this “aggregation” to more than 0.01 I can see the wall spikes at certain tiers like 61.00 and 62.00 etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:20:24
Yeah it’s odd, I was talking to others about it today and one guy was saying there was a way to bamboozle them and they end up underbidding and losing cash but I can’t see how. I figure I just put my min in close to where I sold and go to bed. It’s been fine every morning :) just don’t bid too low 
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:37:08
Are limit trades free on Gemini?
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:21:48
So basically we’re fighting two hash rates? Or can the miners do both chains?
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:28:49
They make their money on fees and people trading on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:33:53
With hardware that’s never on the internet in a paper wallet. Like seriously �� he’s an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:52:22
Friday payday!!! Whooo hoooooo! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:12:34
No, there are videos out there covering this and what a signed firmware update does. That’s the whole reason behind these devices. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:44:10
IF people value the new coin it will. If they don’t, it won’t. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:42:03
Love my TREZOR and thinking of getting a couple more for smaller wallets. Maybe a Nano too. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:51:41
Yup my trades sold at 5900 I hope I can get it back lower lol �� I was like “holy shit”... “oh oops I didn’t expect it all to sell...”
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:58:39
Contact resistance works with other metals differently than gold. Yeah the available electrons inside the bar change the electromagnetic properties.   That’s how they found this CAD bar!
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:31:05
Gdax doesn’t have any on limit sells/buys so I think it might work?
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:58:02
I was just thinking that.. Can you actually buy on the micro? When it drops for a split second from like 5700 to 5300 can you buy in that moment? Is that what the stock market people do?
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:33:06
Ok yeah that’s what I was wondering, cause everyone here is saying the TREZOR was less and I couldn’t figure it out till now. If you buy from THEM then it’s more but a trusted source! 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:21:22
Haha welllll I got a little too excited last night an had moved $500 into it and then it went down.... and down.... and DOWN.  I was like “oh ...fuk what did I just do”.   Said well guess I need to learn more and went to bed.
Woke up and it seemed to recover but I’m at like $450 now. Still lost. Hopefully it will go back :( 
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:50:31
Omfg I just realized... you can sell locally at a premium because people want to buy local... so you could go buy low and sell to them high and keep the profits!!! Holy crap!
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:03:35
Can also backup your private seed too 
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:11:42
No I mean your plastics are water resistant right?. So just write your seed on it with the laser (the backup words). 
I think fire would kill those fast though.
For proper backup should be on a metal like a dog tag so it withstands heat and other factors. 
Can your laser engrave on stainless steel? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:00:10
I went to type a reply but it’s going up so fast I can’t even delete and retype lol 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:12:17
This why GDAX has BTC over $6300?
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:47:08
Works the same with gold for example:
Go to gold exchange guy (Coinbase) “hi I’d like one oz please”
He gives you gold. 
So you’re previous question “how do I spend my money”.
Well either the merchant you now goes to will take gold or you go back to the exchange (Coinbase) and sell back your gold at a higher or lower rate and then you’re back in cash. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:46:06
Yup no fees that way!
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:56:34
Just sitting in it at the dealership prolly... it is in a parking lot after all �� 
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:03:47
Wait, so if it’s a gain in BTC how do they know what to tax it on? This doesn’t make sense and I do believe you’re wrong. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:20:58
In an exchange that doesn’t deal in USD but pure crypto? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:40:55
Ok will try it out. On a cruise now so I only have limited sat internet that works for bids lol.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:22:07
I'm thinking of getting a Nano just to have one as I already have a Trezor. One for the bank with loads and one for daily trading... right? lol
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:54:26
No to download it lol. Visa would have worked but they charged less if you used BTC lol 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:24:45
So if it sits in the exchange then it’s “realized”?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:37:58
I change to 6K. Can I have my karma back?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:39:01
is leaking ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:17:10
So much so that people saying others are believing propaganda yet they swim in it themselves. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:01:37
USD direct to Coinbase and then USD to GDAX.  It’s quite a wait but no fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:15:26
Yup got more out of it ALREADY! whoooo
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:44:49
Ugh 488 dollars not coins sorry new to this. Yeah it seems to be confirmed now. Was really scared it wasn’t going to go though. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:17:52
Operation rug pull is a go! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:27:06
So you’re saying traders basically have access/accounts/capital on several exchanges and if they see one not keeping up then help balance it naturally?
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:43:46
Mine was payment for gay porn. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:43:28
That’s hilarious, are these all the bots I see with limit orders popping off and back on the  books like every half a second? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:41:52
I hate brats that pull charge back shit on companies.  If they would go to Coinbase and explain what happened but instead they go on the message boards to whine. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:59:49
If you’re right then it just caught a ton of bulls in a fat trap! 
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:45:26
No, “limit trades.” It’s a feature of exchanges, not the cap on the trade.
GDAX limit orders are free if you make them!
So you could “penny trade” even with limit orders and make gains :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:03:12
-$1 bills
-1oz gold bullion 
-shit with titles 
Are tangible assets. 
I don’t see why they can’t see a bitcoin wallet as a “tangible asset”.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:49:44
Actually had this issue tonight and my bank was blocking them thinking it was fraud because they did the verification thing where you put in the cents to show you have the card.   I’ve since told them “no Coinbase is not fraud let it go through”.
I was able to make a buy then.
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:42:58
Oh I mean “it” as in “new coin”
“New coin won’t happen at all” sorry was confusing 
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:37:32
Ok now that was fucking hilarious come back. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:34:09
Lucky. Ok there you go. Basically a DIY cryptosteel.com �� 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:18:27
Ok I’ve been dabbling on the market (getting in on the dips) and making quite a bit but I’m looking at it as $100 investment and now I’m at 0.15 but I’m just watching my bitcoin “pile” up as a buy low/sell high but mainly just learning. Taking those 0.001 gains every day and they add up! 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:27:54
Every time it drops like this all I can see is:
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:40:32
Yeah it worked.. and bought it all back half as much��
Now wonder if it will hit 6200 again?!
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:23:17
I mean if you bid right you could make more than the interest. But probably not!
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:00:58
Oh other regions thing. Yeah that’s bad :(
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:47:54
Yea laying off the pot this weekend so I can watch some videos on this. It’s entire new world!
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:03:06
Yeah I bet it goes down into 5k again before coming back up. At least mama didn’t just dip her toe in and go “ohhhh” and run away. Naw we got ankle deep!
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:51:17
Do you need to use something with a Trenzor like Electrum or can you do it without?
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:42:52
Yes they’re owned by the same company. Cross logins too!
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:23:30
Ah right. “Trust who’s leger’s longer” type of thing?

@_date: 2017-10-20 19:31:58
Yeah friend of mine and I were playing with penny trading LTC and were like “why is there no bot for this?!”   Then we both realized that there **are** bots but you could lose a LOT of cash if you fuck up on the bots AI.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:05:40
Yes but those fees pay to the miners for processing the work. It’s not like you pay that asshole to move your money. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:45:28
I know! I sold some back at 5899 this morning and I’m like “aww fuk”. 
“Sky come falling down... we’ll be safe and sound after my market limit order gets in again” �� 
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:01:26
Ok so making fake numbers here for ease..
Let’s say you buy at 100.00
Then it goes to 80.00
Now it sits there up and down in the 80s-90s for a day.
Do you trade then too? Buy in 80s sell in 85s etc?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:03:18
Yeah how many people you think are bidding? A couple whales ain’t doing that big a swing!  ������
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:21:13
I sent 488 coins and it’s still showing pending with only 1 of 6 confirmations. Was it too much to send at once? Do I just wait?
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:50:14
What the hell is going with it today though? 
ETH and LTC are also way odd today.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:15:35
Shot windows only. Well maybe I can side boot a mac
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:53:07
What about the total trade on the left?   I did this with LTC and the left box started going UP to where you had fees on the VOLUME.   Just looking out for ya ;)    Check top right under “my fees”.
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:21:24
Are you withdrawing from GDAX to a BTC address? Their website says "BTC network transfers are fast and free" from withdraw page.
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:03:09
It’s THEIR system that’s “degraded or having issues” then.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:01:07
Yeah that’s a nice ticker cause the default Apple stocks works with ticker “BTCUSD=X” on yahoo for the default. 
What app did you chose?
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:03:43
Right? Like I can do it from across the street with my camera! And with NFC you want me to *touch* you? ICK! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:24:03
Right so if you could just pay with BTC on your phone stead of Apple Pay (using a Chase CC) he the card issues get ✌️nothing✌️ per transaction where we pay ours in the transaction process (miners)?
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:33:35
I am not sure but I think the traffics encrypted. I’m hoping it’s just like https?
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:15:03
So can I take like $50 and “play” with it? Don’t care if I lose it, I just want to learn to buy and sell. Like buy at xxx.22 and sell at xxx.23.  Does that work? Can you learn it on just pennies?
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:35:24
Yeah all these people thinking they are “free”. �� 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:53:13
Right? Like last night I was all “this bitch is ready for round two”. And sure enough $6200 bam! Lol 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:37:37
What are you taking about? I personally control the cryptocurrency market because every time I sell, the price rises.  /s
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:42:46
Ok, I get it now thanks so much. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:43:27
Selling my silver today and using those funds to buy BTC :) 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:04:57
Oh my $ash it will be awesome. Like I have no idea what to do with the money, I just know I probably will never sell :( I just want to horde it all lol!
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:34:10
Okie dokie... lets see if this works!
Is the right term Transaction sent ? made? lol

Not sure if the "low fee" like you said will work, but it's a good test :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:36:59
The price at the exchange is the price THERE not anywhere else. So if the price is lower in another exchange then it’s users value it lower. 
Every exchange can be different. Not usually by much.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:43:32
Paying some asshole for work done. Not to “hold your money”. I’m not good at this lol 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:08:10
Yeah or it won’t happen at all? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:03:03
Haha yeah I tried that. Lost $200 yesterday. Learned my lesson 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:28:07
Just drop box a notepad text file? You’re not sending anything that’s not public able right? Like a BTC addy. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:30:38
And she’d still HODL! 
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:17:19
I wanted to buy something myself with bitcoin (I know I know I will get slack for this lol) but anyway back then (as in quite a few years ago) I had bought a few through coinbase and it worked really well. They do need to verify you (because you're turning money into money right?) and to prevent fraud it takes a few days.   So far that's who I've used. I Want to try to others but they've all wanted several different forms of verification and I have no clue why they can't verfiy me yet... 
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:02:13
Or is a customers car and they valet ��
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:07:57
I’m new at this and only really have done Coinbase. Can you say another that would be fun to learn without fucking myself in fees? Like deposit $100usd and play with it?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:09:14
Ok no there was no sarcasm actually was totally serious but thinking mAaayyybe it’s a bad idea.   
How would you protect yourself then when sending so Coinbase doesn’t get pissy? Send it to a Electrum wallet then send again to a TREZOR? Not trying to do illicit things just want to protect myself from them doing what you said. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:16:59
Ah so you’re saying if you’re doing transactions via your node then it maters. Gotcha. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:33:59
So I moved my BTC from Coinbase where I got it from (for payment from someone) to this ✌️Electrum Wallet✌️   Does this wallet hold my keys for me?
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:56:24
Yeah if you’re gonna drop 1k on something you should be able to afford a hardware wallet. Leaving 1k usd on the exchange is fine but having it floating BTC is not advisable.
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:11:12


11 looooong years :( I can't fucking wait!!
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:19:46
Ok how do you move it? Same as with wallet from one to the other?
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:09:51
I saw it said "low fee" and that it might not get processed. Well it did I guess! (Only after 18 mins? LOL wow nice)
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:22:30
Can you get your parents to invest? Or give them money to help you?

Wait for one while you lose your money or keys? No thanks!

Yeah robinhood doesn’t work this way. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:24:52
Not for that company. Worked for them as a contractor for a bit. Turned down their repeat business cuz they so awful. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:08:09
Did similar, and with places like bitmex you can buy on the price of BTC currently. (Long your current BTC on itself)
With low leverage you can even do a set it an forget it.  Basically earning interest BTC on itself!

Not that many owners? But they put in a special tax for it? I’d think again. That’s why they did.  Cause it’s so popular. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:40:47
This is the reason why I wouldn’t even have brought it up. Cause the app doesn’t take  it so I have no way to prove the reason why I hired them. I’d get out of your car frankly. 
Also you as a passenger would not be protected from liability as a user anymore under Uber. 
If a driver asks you to do this **DON’T**
Source: travel agent here and had someone do similar to this. (Not for paying in BTC but for some other reason to save money) and they got into an accident and the persons insurance company said they were driving commercial w/o being on fare so no pay out also no pay out from Uber and injuries were substantial causing loss of work and they had their lives ruined/drivers too. Not worth it. Using Uber or the like you should be on meter. Protect yourself too!

It’s $200. They are freaking out saying this is the end of bear cycle and the bottom is in. 
Just takes $200 in movement to turn them all bullish. Really this is some funny game to some whales I just know it.
