Yeah dude that was really dumb 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:29:51
I mean... for many of them this is true.

This sub's reaction to this has really made me want to dump all my BTC
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:20:01
Why are minable cryptos better ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:20:41
I have most of my portfolio in bitcoin simply because I think it is the most "stable" coin (despite the insanity happening at the moment).
But long term I think crypto is going to have a new golden child that isn't Bitcoin. My bet is on one of the smaller coins with a massive supply, IOTA perhaps
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:25:41
People said the same thing when BTC was under $1k
Also unfortunately many of the alts are tied to BTC so heavily right now that it doesn't really matter.

Switching back and forth between BTC and LTC feels kinda pointless. They are so closely linked that the swings mirror each other most of the time.

I don't disagree with you. But as it stands right now the bigger the coin the "safer" it is. 
The smaller altcoins have potential for huge growth, but they are also much more likely to bomb

Almost every single one? Look at the market today, almost everything dips with BTC dips 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:57:35
So you bought a dipped LTC with a further dipped BTC?
You lost money on that move, at least so far
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:06:24
The tech behind bitcoin isn't better.
The only reason people support it is because it's the big dog on the block. It has the most power simply because it was first

I could see it dipping as low as 5k in the coming months. 
People forget that it was 1k not very long ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:06:32
Oh my dear god cringe. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:05:02
Yep. 
I bought in at $9690 and was starting to panic a bit when it hit 9k. 
I only put in .1 BTC so it's not all that much even if I lose it all, but it's still a little scary.

Just imagine that the average person is a complete idiot... what do they do? 
They see the price rising: "GIVE ME SOME OF THIS GREEN!"
As soon as it remotely starts to dip: "GET ME THE FUCK OUT!!!" 
If you're good at this (and fast) you can stand to profit from it. The safe and smart thing to do is to just be in it for the long haul.
