Multicultural globalism is the way of the future.  A Star Trek like Federation is what I am most hopeful for.
Its the same scare tactics they tried to use with terrorism.  When the statistics show us that immigrants have a lower crime rate than natives.  Or even how crime in general is way down globally, and every decade is better than the last.  Why?  Not because of nationalistic policies, but because of globalist ones.
We are all humans.  To identify as anything but that seems ludicrous.

If you watch any of his lectures you'll realize not only is he saying nothing new, he is awful at actually expressing concretely what it is he is trying to say.  I think most people leave confused and some liken it to "over their head" and thus that Peterson must know a thing or two.

You are moving the goalposts.  OP said not wanting to be sexually harassed.  You think women wearing heels gives you some kind of right you otherwise wouldn't have if they wore flats?  Seems pretty unrealistic.

Yes.  You put in "white" males, which is completely irrelevant.  Hell, I chuckled too.  Suicide is a problem among males in general.  Who the fuck cares if he is helping WHITE males?  Does he only care about white males?  Like, the fuck?
Peterson is a pseudo-intellectual.  An armchair philosopher.  He overcomplicates basic things and repackages them in a way that people that like to identify as young WHITE males can apparently stomach.

Don't think so, because he's culturally more conservative.  His ridiculous idea of fighting against the tide of Neo-Marxism is a cover for anti-semitism.

This actually sounds like a fascinating perspective and I'd love to hear more.  Without knowing better, I'd hazard a guess to saying your polish family have more "traditional" older values that haven't been updated to modern times?
