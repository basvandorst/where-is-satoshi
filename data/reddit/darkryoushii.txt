By downloading the blockchain (the Bitcoin Core wallet application does this) you are holding a full node worth of information. 
By opening port 8333 in your firewall(a) you are exposing yourself to the world as a full node.

This just got me thinking, does anyone have an Android wallet app that allows you to transfer over NFC / Android Beam?
That would be ideal to avoid the scan QR codes or address transfer business. It would even work for merchants where they can have their device request X amount from you without you being able to alter how much you send.

Building on the idea of coinflow (and another user's idea to use a local webserver) it would be awesome to see a client based craigslist/gumtree running on the netvend backend. 
I can see fully encrypted messages, anonymous by nature and the ability to buy/sell for BTC being excellent reasons why something like this should exist! 
Unfortunately I can't code too well and am amidst university exams.

You should speak to the owner about accepting Bitcoins. It's one thing to be able to buy them but without a legitimate use they'll slip back into worthlessness.

"open source", "P2P", "protocol", "issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.."
Basically I would like to be able to send my Mum a link to a site that explains first up in plain text what it is (digital currency and payment system), what it can do better than paypal (lower fees and faster) and why everyone should use it (no governing body and no geographical restrictions, fees are all the same worldwide etc).
But then on the same website I would also like to be able to send a friend of mine the same link and have them be able to navigate their way to a section that explains in detail what it is and how it works.
And THAT is what the official website for the currency should contain..

You would use the 3,000,000 Yen to buy bitcoins. I didn't check properly about how to buy bitcoins in japan, but I assume those selling it direct will take a percentage cut (fees) for themselves. When I checked quickly, I found a few sellers at 12360 Yen per coin.
3,000,000 yen / around 12300 yen per coin gives you 240 coins.
You would then send this to your family members and they would then sell these 240 coins to bitinnovate or bitpiggy. I know for a fact that bitinnovate will take a 2% fee which means you will end up with less than what you began with.
The issue is that bit innovate will only buy $5000AUD worth of coins each day, roughly 20 coins per day. And you will lose $100 each day in transaction fees. If it takes 10 days to transfer it all, you will lose $1000 in fees. This probably isn't ideal.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:52:17
Not everyone *cares* about bitcoin being anonymous. Sure it helps but if vanity addresses are by choice then anyone who does not care can have a nicer/more professional address to use.
I also don't see how the addresses are larger. They are generated the same as any other address, except en masse until you get one that is correct. 
Unless I'm misunderstanding the concept behind it you seem, from a logical standpoint, very wrong.   
But do correct me if I am.

Here in Australia we have the same thing, but our prepaid monthly plans also give us a monthly allowance for extra services such as these short codes. Also we have the option of topping up that portion at any point in the month. It's completely feasible.

I put in $100 into BTC as 'play money' to test the waters a while back.. After some day trading I have 1.6 BTC.. no where near enough to get a real share but as a student I'm not in a position to throw down any more money, this is the best I can get.
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:29:07
I use BTC-E exclusively. Trading fees are only 0.2% constant rather than Gox's 0.6%. Gox definitely doesn't cater as well for the casual bitcoin user.

Completely luck of the draw, it uses a random seed each time and so it will start from a different address every time the tool is run.
My address wasn't found in 4 hours on my i5-2500K but using my friend's computer while he was away (giving me time to remove all traces of my private key - even though I trust them) and using his graphics card, I found it in 10 - 20 minutes.

I don't use any Microsoft products, don't use IE. Use google as my search engine, email and basically every other service they have, chrome as my browser. Have disabled all tracking in the settings of Windows.. When it comes to privacy I really don't care but I doubt MS would get away with tracking all habits just because someone is using a windows computer. 
They do not know anything about me.
Google on the other hand knows more about me than I know about myself.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:19:29
because for the people who haven't got much bitcoins, spreading it out a bit - no pun intended - so that they actually have enough to play with (assuming they don't just cash it out) and try new things be it gambling, buying things on bitmit or whatever really can't be a bad thing overall for the economy.

lol no. Rooting an android is 99% of the time completely reversible. Same with jailbreak though some claim that "apple can always tell".
I sent my bootloader unlocked, rooted, custom ROM and custom kernel Nexus 4 back to Google on warranty and they replaced it without even asking questions. I said do you mind and they said if we know it's a hardware fault, then we will replace it.
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:27:56
All they do is send a message to the Bitcointip bot saying ACCEPT ALL and the btc will be sent to a wallet set up for them by the bot. 
They can from there send WITHDRAW and specify an address to take it out of the bitcointip bot itself into their own private wallet.

@_date: 2013-11-25 13:14:32
Thank you, I have just been researching and realized that re-used in this context does not mean generated more than once (which is damn rare in itself).
Again though, if you do not care about anonymity (the kind to tweet your breakfast, share locations on facebook and then snapchat all evening) why should you care about address reuse?
And finally from what I can tell there is a single pool who implemented this 'improvement' and are ruining it for the average joe.
If bitcoin has any chance at surviving as a 'currency' it has to appeal to the everyday person. Not everyone will be changing their address every X days and will definitely want to keep a single address.
@_date: 2013-05-09 10:12:54
has an account with where he deposited some bitcoins to the given address. He then used that balance and sent some to for his efforts. 
It works in most major sub-reddits and can be an excellent way to spread the word of bitcoin to other reddit users!

Actually it is running cyanogenmod and is therefore using their custom "trebuchet" launcher. 
Yes, it is cyanogenmod telling him to do that but it is still just a well placed app and coincidence.

You don't "waste" the addresses when you generate them. You don't touch them if they aren't useful to you. It's like picking up and inspecting 999/1000 wallets in a store to see if they suit your needs, but then buying and using one.
Generic comment about how it doesn't matter anyway because there is enough addresses for each atom to have a unique wallet address.

bought 65 [TAT.ASICMINER]( shares last week. Already on a 30 mBTC (0.03 BTC) profit.
That's a fairly nice payout if it remains stable each week for doing absolutely nothing.. :P
@_date: 2013-06-02 13:27:09
You would end up with roughly 240BTC at current market prices.
The current maximum sell amount on an australian site such as  is $5000AUD which means you can sell roughly 20BTC per day. If the market stays stable, you can get your 3,000,000 YEN to ~$30,000 AUD in roughly 11 and a half days. Of course you could also juggle this between both bitinnovate and  to get your BTC into AUD faster.

I don't get it, so I get it's a paper wallet, and I get it can probably be used for two way transactions. But if it has a bit-value on the face then why would you need an easily scannable public key? Surely if it has a bit-value it's meant for one time use - to give someone x amount of BTC - which means they wouldn't really need the public key to be easily scannable unless they wanted to verify it had the right balance..
Infact following that idea this would be an excellent way to give a monetary gift card while spreading the word about bitcoin.. but you may end up looking like an absolute douche while doing it. :\
Thoughts anyone?
