Plot twist, Btc is actually created by elites to surpass cash and control plebs easier.
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:33:02
As I already said, it is like that, but at the moment it's the best system we have. Such system is not created by some old, evil, white men that want to rob poor people. Banks are not here to turn your life into a nightmare and to ruin it. 
And no, crypto is not here to bring salvation and eternal life to the little guy. It's just another tool for speculation and most possibly it will be used for the benefit of those who're already rich, not poor. 95% of retail crypto investors and traders will lost their money, will not make it with crypto. Only a handful of little guys managed to become rich thanks to crypto, but they were in the right place in the right time... and that will not happen again.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:25:37
If crypto is here to empower people and to help the revolution (that was the idea in the beginning, right?) it should have nothing with regulation, elites, etc. BTC is tamed and hijacked by elites and became pointless. Just another currency controlled by the same people who control Dollar.
@_date: 2019-10-22 11:36:00
Only guys who bought it at $16k would do this. And those who're in since 2011 are laughing.
@_date: 2019-10-17 12:55:49
Dicaprio memes are so cheesy. I'm sorry for people who're still hodling no matter what is happening. Hodl was a successful strategy until Dec '17 but since then it is a terrible idea. You have to adapt to the market which is constantly changing. Permanent hodling is pointless.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:07:31
The more they trade it, price is going lower. Crypto was a way better without futures and all those derivates created by scammers.
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:43:21
You're too busy with preparing the biggest revolution that will finally replace the old, evil system and finally establish the rule of oppressed masses? Good luck! :)
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:57:41
You're right. Our happiness is the most important, after all. Win win situation! Have a nice evening, my bloke.
@_date: 2019-10-20 15:16:33
I agree, but they're not in this subreddit or in any other internet forum. They're today running successful business in some real niches or are drugged/dead.
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:36:35
You really believe that poor people have some (any) power?
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:45:39
No, I'm not telling you you'r trowing your money away. Chances are you will make money. But only because you were good at gambling, not because BTC will change the world.
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:56:34
"stealing from people". Uh, oh! Evil elites! Do you know who's robbing you? Crypto exchanges, crypto gurus, crypto whales, and other "crypto" prophets. They're stealing money from average Joe and manipulate him, not your parliament, president or guys at your bank.
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:09:13


What kind of question is this, in the first place? Is crypto nazism, so if someone disagrees, he should be sent to a concentration camp?  
I'm here because I'm investing in crypto and mining it for years. But guys, please, get rid of that childish narrative "we poor people vs evil elites", "BTC will destroy banks" and similar. It is not like that and it will not happen.   
The current economy is the best we can have, people today live better than ever. The system we live in offers us incredible opportunities for success and the world a much better place than 100, 200, 300 years ago.   
Do you know that just 80-100 years ago, kids as young as 6 had to work 12 hours in mines just to get some food? And you say that we're oppressed by evil elites, that our lives are miserable, that someone is robbing us?  
Come on, guys. Stop that "revolutionary" bullshit, get real and enjoy your life.
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:53:36
You don't need to be concerned. Nothing catastrophic will happen. The economy will slow down sometimes, then it will improve again, in cycles. If you're good at your trade, smart and work hard, you will be ok.
@_date: 2019-10-19 17:13:22
The problems are:  
* all those "if you invested" are cherry-picked
* most of the plebs bought BTC when it was 16k
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:31:05
The problem is, the average Joe aka crypto guy thinks he understands how the macroeconomy works. Money printing is a normal thing. Without it, you, your parents, friends etc wouldn't have a job, home, car. You would not live in a first-world country. Money printing allowed you to live much much better live than your ancestors had 100-200 years ago.   
If we back to gold or switch to BTC or anything with limited supply, we would back to the Medieval ages. 
Just please don't pretend you understand how the world works. Believe me, money printing is here for your own good.
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:58:28
It isn't perfect, you're right, but it is the best system humanity has right now. At one point it will be improved, but I'm sure it will not be ruined or replaced by some internet money invented by people who hide their identity.

Venezuelan problems are more caused by the US, than by any other thing. But it's not for this subreddit...
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:39:33
Their problems are not caused by money printing at all. It is just a consequence of many other bad things in their economy.

Elites don\`t care about BTC at all. If they do, they would buy most of BTC and put it under control.
@_date: 2019-12-16 16:46:36
Pretty stupid, back in 1920 nobody had $3000 monthly salary. What matters is economy growth, not what you can buy with $20. People today have much better lives and standard than ever before.

Ok, we'll come back if that happens, but you promise as well you'll come back if btc hits $1,200 by 2022.
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:45:32
Unfortunately I didn't, but will do on the next spike if it ever happens.
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:53:15
Traders don't want to outperform the market. They just don't believe BTC will ever hit 250k or 100k or 50k... Traders are not believers. They're businessmen. Traders just react on what's happening now. Hodlers are dreamers who don't have a way to protect their investment. If you're lucky you'll get rich, if you're not lucky, you'll lost it all. In contrast to that, traders have control over their risk and they get out when they're wrong. Not staying on a ship that is sinking.
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:34:33
Nope, traders don't believe, don't hope, don't pray. They have set of rules and obey only to them.For traders profits only matters. Despite the currency. Btc, usd, yen, pound, Turkish lira, Malagasy ariary, ETH... It's all the same for a trader.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:39:41
I respect what the US and it's citizens achieved, but you're not the wealthiest nor the most advanced nation. Compared to many European countries the quality of life in the US is just average.

If you plan never to sell, why do you hodl in the first place? If you plan to sell at some point, you had a great chance to do so in early 2018, but you missed it. Please don't pretend you don't care about not selling your bag when btc was $19,000. All you guys here are for money and all of you hodlers would sell if you knew what's going to happen.  
Hodler is just another name for greedy people. You guys think the price will always go up and you're never satisfied with your current profits and always want more. Greedy!

People will never wake up, because every peasant want to become one of "them". It's not we against them but "me against other peasants trying to join elites" (and exploit peasants once I succeed).

Yes, in a good way.

Deflation worked miracles for the medieval economy. I'm sure that's the way to go.
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:49:03
They can accumulate for years, during bear markets. Indeed, that would push prices up, but with all coins they bought and with unlimited money, banks would be able to control price.
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:51:16
I just know I'm going to stick to real money when it comes to real business, and will not ask for any crypto in the future.

That's what Rogier from the BTC Telegram group would say. And he's wrong 2-3 years in the row.

Oh, didn't knew about it. Paying in BTC is some kind of adoption, so I thought its okay to mention it here...

My favorite social site for 2019!
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:49:29
I've just found [Mamby.io]( \- a website that pay it's users in BTC to post content. It is similar to Pinterest, but just better :) Will give it a try. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:06:49

200 EMA,  Cryptowat.ch. It is near 8800 on it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:21:30
Most of the people don't understand what it is. Crypto needs real adoption, not just another instrument for speculation... We need someone to start to use crypto, not just to bet on price.
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:28:26
Wait for it to close the gap at 9k... this is where the real battle will start. If price manage to climb above, it will be bullish. However, I expect very strong seller's pressure around that price. Everyone and their mom are now waiting for 9k to short btc. We'll know its real direction after the 9k battle.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:37:09
Dropped just a little below 200 MA on the daily. I assume now big players will wait for noobs to open their short position and then will push price back beyond 9k.
