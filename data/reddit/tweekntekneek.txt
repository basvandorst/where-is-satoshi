Can someone explain this cartoon to me? 
Sorry I’m stupid or something and don’t get it.
Is it that he says no to some merchant and wants to save money? But bitcoin kills him instead because he was unaware of it? 
Lol ......what is going on!!!

Cool I’m in the technology industry and I too know things! (Probably with more accurate information and similarly powerful people.) No offense, but “entertainment ppl” aren’t going to be the best dictators of understanding the fundamentals of blockchain and how it’s embedded across the world. 
If your scenario were to happen the entire world would be at war. Crypto is bigger than the NSA and USA. 
Know your facts before you spew your conspiracy.
The crypto market is much larger now than all of the United States stock market. 
Centralized banks will certain not give up easily. But guess what centralized banks use entertainment puppets to start the propaganda and entail fear.
Good job on being that entertainment sock puppet. Wake the fuck up, and attack them not bitcoin!

No it’s been high. Coinbase charges sometimes $100 more than the actual BTC going rate when you buy through them. Always, always, always buy through gdax if your using Coinbase.

If you think that future traders don’t have BTC then your an idiot l! Yes the concept of future traders doesn’t require BTC, but those who have steak in its price will accumulate BTC to be able to adjust markets for price profiting

This morning after crushing past the wall, BTC crossed $18,000 and then fell back.
Could be the futures holding the price back up so it’s gains are more predictable tomorrow morning

@_date: 2017-12-22 23:49:52
Agreed! More times than not this can bite you in the butt! I also sold at 16k and bought at 12,700.
Overall I got lucky. Plain and simple! 
Hodling is not a religious-cult act! It is the most basic principal of “investing” 
When we take theses risks we are no longer investing, we are trading. The two have a fundamental difference and can lead to poor growth of crypto. But when so much money is on the line, it’s hard not to! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:59:15
This is a good call. Even  since $5,000 these dips stir up a little bit of sweat but is part of the same upward pattern I’ve seen. I think I’ve already felt 2-3 dips since October. This dip feels a little different, because this dip is also correlated with the futures deal. 
In the end I still have a hard time not seeing BTC reach $20,000 soon and cross that before 1/2018.

I think there still slight resistance to 18 k and 19k on gdax but this will definitely get to $20K faster than ppl think.  Also, I’m surprised how it hasn’t fallen further back. Ppl buying right now know this is going to the moon! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:48:08
I totally agree.  I bought in early before $5,000. Told my friends about it and even helped them open an account. By the time they transferred funds and got their money in Coinbase, the price was $11,000. Literally ever since then, they are experts of crypto and tell me how I should invest my money. 
Like wtf , 1 week ago they didn’t even know what crypto was. 
Anyways , same guys are telling me to sell it after seeing it go down.  I’m starting to wonder if they either didn’t really buy the BTC for that price and want it to go further down so they can buy it or they are genuinely jealous we got in at a point that we can already see 3x-4x gains. I dunno but it’s real, and it’s disgusting.

Bitcoin is still the future. Yes we all heard the MySpace vs. Facebook reference, and it’s getting old.
The plain facts are that bitcoin, just like MySpace single handedly shifted technological paradigms, has existed with competition (like your facebooks) and yet is still the majority of the market cap in this space.
It’s still the king coin even after three months of heavy altcoin introduction. Bitcoin has the support of future traders and Wall Street investors, bitcoin is what vendors still first aim to accept even today, bitcoin is still what new exchanges revolve their market around. Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere, this talk is parasitic and delusional  
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:10:22
Your post is great. Your logic is solid.
But you talking shit like a degenerate to me isn’t going to help! 
If not Coinbase today, then tomorrow another “bank”
One Day sure we may bank ourselves through our own computers. 
But today’s state we need to see what will happen with BTC. If it’s in a vault and the value drops to nothing you won’t even have time to sell. Until the dust settles down I think leaving it on an exchange may be better.
Lastly, what advantages are you speaking of that BTC has, that another coin does not? I care about “potential”, but in today’s world we need to deliver results in a timely manner. When will I see the potential, that I haven’t already seen rising on other Alts?

Your right actually. Also that day it was skyrocketing very fast. I’m glad you watch those curve as adamantly as I do. Did you notice after the 19k drop and Coinbase was working correctly again there was a sudden large red sell wall? That shit was scary. And all of a sudden there was no solid buy wall until 13k. Now we’re around 13K and the next solid buy wall is 8k. (Which I suppose is the base level your referring to) is base levels the point required to fill the gap from lowest wall to highest wall ? (8k-20k)?

What the fuck I noticed the same thing. What is going on I wonder?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:35:31
I didn’t read this in time. I sold at 17,249.99... fucking heart sunk when it skyrocketed. I’ve never done anything like this before.
I immediately put all of the money into lightcoin @ 255- cashed out at $270 and bought back my BTC and made change.
I know i probably could have made more if I left it in ltc. But I want my BTC and I also want a coin that’s getting more stable. 
A lesson I learned today. Fuck buying and selling ... just hodl. Shit is risky 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:40:42
Got it! Thanks makes sense

@_date: 2017-12-10 10:32:51
I’m holding! Got in for for less than $5000. If The price goes to $10,000 I’ll sell and most likely buy back in for cheaper. 
This is one amazing ride and I won’t let myself miss out on a technological revolution. There are only 21 million. If billions of people are going to start trading this thing, I would think it’s only a matter of time for 1BTC =$1,000,000
Am I crazy to think this or....?
Anyway HODL. Let’s all reach our moons! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:52:45
All your post about BTC seem to be negatively positioned on the coin. Seems like you just don’t believe in it, believe ya a bubble and compare it to the tulip crisis in your previous post. 
That’s said why do you feel it will fall down to $5,000?

Get your head out of your ass. I own bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Let’s all make money and not have to hate on another coin. 
Also all I said is I don’t like how they constantly hate on bitcoin. Bro that’s just the facts. If all your gonna do is spew hate then maybe your too much of a dumbass you can’t articulate or explain clearly. 
Bcash is a much better coin technologically in the sense the fees are smaller and transactions are faster.  See how I said that without being a dick? See how I sill own both of these coins? See how I’m making money while also making friends?

I’ll hodl new friends! 
I really shouldn’t be pissed because I got in closer to $5,000. But seeing it go up to $19,000 and back to $13,000 - is scary. I saw this happening in gdax and kinda kicking myself that I didn’t atleast sell and buy more back for less. 
Also most the people I’m hanging out with speculate that when futures go up it will go up slightly and then plummet. 
Telling me 2017 was the year of BTC but now I should move my money from BTC to something else while there’s still money to be moved. 
All I can say is fuck them. 
I Fucking taught them how to open an account and get crypto (they got closer into it at $11000k) and now they are some how experts. But I feel a weird jealously feeling they have on me for getting in earlier. Were all making money here!!
Let’s hodl hodl hodl! I haven’t reached the moon yet, I’m  only around 3x....And my moon is 1btc=$1million. Let’s both be millionaires together as we hodl through this bullshit!

Good you shouldn’t have asked the stupid question. This isn’t a place to ask questions that there are already 100s of  threads explaining how forks works.
If you must know forks work as a tool for eating food. Usually the user uses the fork to transfer food from their plate into their mouth for consumption. You can claim these forks at your local grocery store.

I’m pretty sure I’ve been holding on to BTC longer than you think, and I’ve never asked BTC price drop questions before. My question was because I noticed an attack on BTC unlike those that have happened before.

When you assume it will be a hardfork and no additional coin is made, then is there really a purpose to transfer out of Coinbase. I mean I understand they give you an IOU, but it seems to be a reliable IOU. As you stated earlier they are insured.
However I presume there is still the possibility it is a soft fork and a second coin is created?
