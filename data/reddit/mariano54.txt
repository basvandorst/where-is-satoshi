Make sure that you trust Alice, or meet her in person and wait for confirmations when you buy something. Otherwise you could use multisig transactions with a trusted third party.

Stanford had a cryptocurrency course last year, don't forget! (I believe stanford was the first)

Great explanation, didn't think of it that way. Is there a way to set a percentage of how much you want in Bitcoin and how much you want in dollars?
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:31:29
Stanford, CA! In the middle of silicon valley, tons of tech people here, and many people in the university are starting to know / use it.
Also very close/accessible to San Francisco.

What assholes! I hope they read this and feel like shit. However I know they won't feel bad, considering what kind of people they are.
We do not want these sexists associated with bitcoin... Great post btw and I wish you luck..
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:48:14
That is very impressive. I really think you must be quite smart to understand that in hour. Considering that it takes days just to understand bitcoin itself first.

coinmap.org make sure it's up there! 
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:18:46
The thing is..  Some people here actually do XD
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:42:11
I logged in just to upvote this.
@_date: 2014-01-23 05:10:56
Put it on coinmap.org !

I'm gonna try to get the 290, but since it comes with a gift  I think the  code doesn't apply :/

He is one of the biggest VC's in silicon valley. A lot of people here really value what he has to say. Great article.

I definitely think that we should be telling noobs to use coinbase, instead of cold storage. Paper wallets and offline backups are way to complicated, and the security risks are much higher if you don't know what you're doing. Coinbase is great for a few BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:46:52
Great class,  I took it. However a lot of the Bitcoin concepts like elliptic curves and digital signatures are in the second class,  crypto 2.
I highly recommend taking them both. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:17:17
Any idea what time it starts? Not working yet 
@_date: 2014-01-18 01:58:38
And if you're going to learn python, I recommend this tutorial written by the creator of python.

Pretty good article, however his definition of fiat currency is wrong: "money that has no backing other than the value it is perceived to have".
Bitcoin has no backing either, and it's value is what we percieve it to be.  However, the fallacy that a currency needs to be backed by something with "intrinsic value" is wrong. This is because intrinsic value does not exists. All value is subjective, based on who is looking at it.

Better to not mention mining at all when explaining Bitcoin for the first time. It just complicates things, and is really hard to understand.
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:30:23
Make sure its on coinmap.org !
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:38:17
Also it is important that they allow you to send btc / receive btc to and from any address. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:56:48
Put it on coinmap and I'm sure you'll get more!
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:08:27
I highly doubt coinbase does FRB. I'm guessing you could probably be paid at least 95% of your coins. But I'm not sure. To be honest though, the team is great and I really trust them as a good company.

I'm from argentina.  It's not a ripoff,  that's the market value.  The peso is really doing bad right now.  However the government rate is not the real rate.  They can try as hard as the can to get that rate with their cards, but at the end of the day,  the real rate is 14, and that's what you have to expect with the peso.. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:27:39
Wow this is great news for Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-04-20 08:31:33
Kk i'll see if I can implement some of these options.
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:17:23
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:02:08
I really hope Argentina starts paying attention to this. I heard not many people when know what it is there.
The inflation and corrupt  government make it the perfect country for the use of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:10:17
This is huge for argentina, and Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:08:10
May I ask who is the Stanford proffessor? Because I'm studying there now. Either way, this sounds like an excellent idea! This can really help get bitcoin up.
@_date: 2013-11-17 07:56:35
+$10 verify
Just some btc from a cbhs alumni. Keep doing what you're doing guys!

I will try my best to accomplish this! I am still a beginner coder, and this will be a good exercise to learn how to use websockets and a server. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:55:59
We have to stop promoting the fallacy that a currency must be 'backed' by something real. This is 100% false! Value is subjective, and things have valued because we percieve them to. Gold's intrinsic value is probably 1% of its speculative value. Same with dollars... It really is irrelevant. People need to understand this. Now the deflation, now that's something to argue about.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:05:59
You have nothing to lose by accepting Bitcoin. You can implement a service (like BitPay) That automatically converts the bitcoins to dollars for you. In this case, it's a win win. Those that want to use dollars will still use them. You will get free press, and attention from Bitcoiners, and you don't have to worry about the current price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:55:07
Long term rise!!! 
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:33:36
Keep it up man! Don't stop spreading the message and helping others understand bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:39:16
Yeah bad things can happen, but if the price gets low, many people will buy a lot just in case... Unless ofc the crypto fails or something
@_date: 2013-05-27 09:16:03
What's your address?
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:30:03
Yeah there is a small movement but adoption from merchants, and general public awareness is not that high as Europe/us
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:32:41
I mean once you have your account with bitstamp set up, you're good. The recent transaction spike has definitely been mostly investing and speculation. Not much buying products.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:22:28
Python / C / frontend developer here! I'd definitely be willing to contribute. Shoot me a PM.  
edit: I have some ideas for the design of the site.. BitMits is really bad IMO! This can be improved a lot.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:12:03
No, he means why would anyone use bitcoins today, when you can just use dollars
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:16:39
He picked exactly the wrong things to criticize about bitcoin... The current price increase is not due to it's deflationary nature...... It's due to increase in demand/adoption. The real thing to argue about is the long term deflationary nature, but that's not a stability problem... Its a lack of investment problem 
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:58:57
That's a lot of bitcoin
