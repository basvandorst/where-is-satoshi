With such a tool available to the public and increased exposure, less consumers will seek traditional gift cards in lieu of gyft's more flexible option. It's a chicken or egg kind of question, but i think it won't be a huge problem for gyft to acquire merchants BC I'm one of those consumers who never used gift cards until btc met gyft. Gyft just became a way to utilize a tech I believe in and save a little on my most frequented stores.

yeah, that's true, we should find our own solution(s).
But the government, as bad as it often is, is based on an ideal that was/is good. Just because it is bad now doesn't mean the people can't change it. isn't this the point of democracy?

could you elaborate on why a centrally administered currency doesn't require a blockchain? I don't know which specific part of the blockchain's benefits it would nullify. Thank you :)
