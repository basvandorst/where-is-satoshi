No one has ever said trading is risk free. That is literally what trading is all about tho. Every noob comes into the game wanting to be a trader and chase profit only to later realise after they've lost everything that trading is almost soley about risk management.

This is so fucking complicated... Beacuse I want everything to be automated and not me doing all the calculations by hand.... I could go by hand and calcualte everything into dollar, beacuse I cant measure btc profits in sats like with alt coins, so it just fucks the system I ve built up...

Okay so my excel document only calcualtes in sats or usd. I cant pick and choose. One or the other.
Lets say I buy Y amount off X coin for 100 Satoshis ea and sell in profits. I enter the values in to my coded excel file and it calculates all the nessesary data I need. (Mentioned above)
Lets also say I buy BTC the same day. 
I long 1.7 BTC for 3800k$ ea and also sell into profits. Now I enter the values in the docs , but there is a problem. How do I insert 3800k$ in sat value?
It would be like saying I bought 1.7 BTC for 1.7BTC since 1BTC = 1BTC.
I can no longer include my btc trades into the doc and it beomce meaningless since many of my swings are taken on btc.

I don't need luck, my SR is above 65% sir. Tank doe.

Thanks, but the only way to learn is to let the market be your guide. Journaling is essential. Also Ive been day trading for about 2 years, I know what Iam doing.

Legit no good crypto journals out there and doing this shit in GSS is a fucking headache. Anyone know a better solution?
@_date: 2019-03-10 22:21:17
Iam sorry you feel this way sir.

So I think you're right about having everything in usd value, came to the same conclusion. 
  
I wonder If I could have a function to do this automatically for me in gss. :Thinking:

If you have a SR above 60%, a RRR+2, and you have a high level of diceplin where you're not chasing or revenge trading. It's gonna be hard to lose money in the long run.
Do I need luck if I always have AA vs AK pre flop every game?

They only track investment progress, nothing more nothing less. I need more data (like Edgewonk)

Literally have. Using google spreadsheets tho, not a pro at all. My problem is not that I don't know how to code it. The problem  lays within I cant transfer btc into sat. Read comment above.
@_date: 2019-03-10 19:43:30
Yes but how do I program this so my spreadsheet uses sats instead of dollar.

All I find are portfolio trackers
But those are  absolutely useless for a day trader.....

Would you say my post came off as arrogant or a bit unclear?
