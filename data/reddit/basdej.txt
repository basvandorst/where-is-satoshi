Could be worse, i am waiting for 4 days already. Check here how many unconfirmed transactions there are.  Given that there are about 2000 per block it could take a while.

We dont have a glass bowl which predicts the future.

No reason, just takes more time than usual due to a high volume of unconfirmed transactions.
