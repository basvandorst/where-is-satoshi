Twitter:  too. I found it by googling "Yours Network", "Yours" too but it's further down.

Btcd is just bitcoin written in the Go language. It's still bitcoin. Just serving the same data in a diff programming language.  Sending to a bitcoin address on a btcd wallet would not "mix" your coins, it would appear as any other transaction on any normal block explorer.
Think of like it like a diff flavor of bitcoin. Btcd is milk chocolate, bcoin is of course caramel, bitcoind is dark chocolate with a creamy core center.

No bcoin is not an altcoin. It's the same consensus conforming protocol as regular bitcoin; it's just another way to access the bitcoin network in a different programming language. Fullnode bitcoin implementations and what qualifies as one is really confusing. But currently btcd, bitcoin core, NBitcoin, and bcoin are all various implementations of the same bitcoin protocol, just with a diff language that a different field of developers can comprehend.

You can learn more about how Purse protects its customers and prevents fraud by catching the fraud Amazon misses. Check out this post with the video that explains their fraud prevention system.

What's recommended? Im referring to the user going through PayPal, after receiving BTC on Purse. He/She could just sell to an exchange instead.

Not sure why the user in the article sells through PayPal. They could easily use one of Purse's partner exchanges in India and sell the bitcoin there directly. Perhaps with time this will become the norm.

This whole episode is about Bitcoin? What?

Users who value privacy who use PIA can be referred to Purse now to make purchases with bitcoin (and privacy conscious individuals are the most apt to look into new technologies like bitcoin).
On top of that, users who use Purse who want a trusted VPN service can be introduced and referred to PIA, and they can purchase their services with bitcoin.

What's changed is the formal partnership and the referral links for Purse's service advertised on their site, permanently.

Take a look at BlockAI. Integrations with something akin to it could very well do just that.

Seems like a solid interpretation 
@_date: 2016-07-13 05:09:34
1) The economics of those $1000/post won't last at scale. Only reason this is happening is due to this being a relatively new currency ( I been around the block) 
2) If STEEM can scale with all the technical overhead of 2-3 currencies while satisfying a growing userbase, they should sell lessons to Bitcoin devs. 
3) And micropayments are the point, a little at scale is a lot. Yours is building sustainability, and real open source technology to decentralized all things. Not just Yours. 
How you can fathom Yours will be DOA when built on Bitcoin, yet STEEM found success as a new altcoin, is beyond me.
Best of luck though for your short term gains.
