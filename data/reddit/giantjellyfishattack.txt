I believe it's a bubble. 
But I don't think it will pop for at least another year.

I can explain why I believe it is. This is just my opinion though. 
If you look into bitcoin, there is nothing backing the currency. The only reason 1 bitcoin is worth $800, is because someone out there is willing to pay $800 for it. That is the only reason. A lot of people are holding onto bitcoins because they believe it will go up in price eventually. The problem with this, is whenever someone sells a bitcoin, the value goes down. 
Let's say I have 1 bitcoin. And I look at the market, someone is willing to buy it for $800. And someone is trying to sell it for $800.10. Well lets say I want to sell it and i sell it for $8000.  Well now that order is gone and the next person says "well im only going to pay $799.00 for my bitcoin" and puts in a buy order for that.  Now all of the sudden the most you can sell it for is $799. The value of the coin just dropped by $1 because of that.  When everyone starts to sell their bitcoins, the price will drop because of it. And because they aren't backed by anything, they essentially hold no real value. It's all speculation at this point. 
  Look at it like a rare baseball card. Lets say only 10 of them printed into existence. If you happened to get one of these cards, the price is purely based on what some dude will buy it for. If you have no buyers, then the card is worthless. But if someone wants that card, it can be worth whatever he wants to buy it for. If you put it on ebay for $400, and someone else puts his same card on it for $275. Then someone buys that $275.. well that card is now technically worth $275. This is all bitcoin is. 
  That makes this a bubble. But the bubble might not ever burst, if you look at the USD, the same thing is happening right now. It stopped being back by gold and the only reason it's worth anything is because people don't understand what a $20 bill really represents and just assumes it's worth something. I also predict a USD crash in the near future.
  Who knows though.  Just my opinions. I could be totally wrong.
