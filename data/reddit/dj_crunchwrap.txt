Not yet. Still very very early for LN.

Little over $1 mil I think. 75% or so coming from one anonymous guy.

Lol go fuck yourself pal.

it's trading on binance
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:45:49
Margin trading. If you're using 2x margin, if Bitcoin goes up $1000 you make $2000. 5x margin you make $5000. During upswings you can make a killing. During downswings you can be ruined.

Still just the testnet for now. Hopefully rolling out to the mainnet soon.

I do see a lot of similarities. It is incredibly hard to keep up with the daily updates of the crypto world and to research enough to get a solid understanding of all the key concepts. Just like it's incredibly hard to follow every update from DC and understand every political topic/policy issue. It's much easier to pick a side, dig your feet into the ground, convince yourself that you're right and attack everyone expressing a different opinion.

Pretty silly before there is a mobile lightning wallet, but still very exciting.
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:36:58
Uncertainty in the dollar would definitely help it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:26:42
I swear. These crypto subs are getting as bad as r/politics and r/the_donald. Yes Brian Armstrong has expressed a little favoritism towards ethereum in the past but we don't need to blow every goddam thing out of proportion. Liking one tweet is not publicly rooting for Bitcoin to fail.

Haven't seen this before. Thanks OP. There is no one I can think of that is more deserving of what happened than Andreas.

Instead of donating everyone should go and buy his books and read them. Win win for everyone.

It means the founders of Ripple gave themselves 80% of the coins without even having to work for it (i.e. mining).

The best representative we could ask for. The dude's a legend.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:00:57
There are, but today it's mostly just a novelty. The high fees make it impractical to spend on minor purchases and those merchants that do accept it report very people actually using it. Things will hopefully change with LN.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:32:05
Him or Jamie Dimon
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:45:56
Today, no one is spending bitcoin because they expect it to increase in price and no merchants are accepting bitcoin because the fees are too high.
I'm thinking that once the Lightning Network is up and running, we'll start to see a lot of merchants, especially online merchants, start to accept bitcoin as payment once the fees become negligible.
I'm thinking that the game-changing explosion in adoption will come after merchants realize that they can save 3% in processing fees when customers use bitcoin. As an incentive to get people to use bitcoin, they will pass some of these savings onto the customer and offer a 1-2% discount for those using bitcoin. Once people can save money by spending bitcoin then they will begin to use it.
It's looking like 2018 is the year that Lightning Network gets up and running and 2019 is the year Bitcoin really goes mainstream.

uh so what exactly happened on gdax? price jumped from 3k to 8k in 5 minutes. meanwhile its still at 3k on other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:35:11
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:05:28
Yeah that's definitely one thing I'm curious about. Will some merchants go to a cash/bitcoin only model? Will they keep Visa/Mastercard and offer discounts anyway? Will they have some legal workaround where they have a separate, bitcoin-only website? Inferior technology can only keep a hold on its monopoly for so long.
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:17:15
holding bitcoin is using bitcoin. similar to using a savings account
@_date: 2019-03-21 04:55:52
Don't listen to that guy. Jack is spending money out of pocket to improve Bitcoin. This is all upside. The alt-right crowd just hates him because they've been banning white supremacists from Twitter.
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:16:02
Might be time to ditch coinbase
@_date: 2019-03-29 04:49:36
This is great. Are there any send &amp; receive mainnet LN wallets for iOS yet?
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:28:25
Slow customer service I think has been the biggest complaint. There have been cases where people have been waiting on 5 figure deposits/withdrawals and had to publicly shame them to get a response.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:36:31
I just downloaded the Lightning mobile app from Lightning Labs and funded the wallet. Any legitimate places that accept btc over LN? I want to try it out.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:29:15
We did it!
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:46:16
I was expecting choppy waters from 10k to 20k as people were finally getting back to even and selling. And then parabolic growth once we reach an ATH and everyone is back in black.
Not happening so far though.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:18:31
Selling half is the move. Not everything needs to be an all or nothing epic decision.
Imo selling now and missing out on possible 10x or more gains in the future is as bad if not worse than the bubble bursting and losing 90% of what you have.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:45:45
If the market cap of Bitcoin was the same as the market cap of gold it would be worth around $400K. That's a realistic looooong term target.
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:16:40
He's rumored to control 5% of the supply. Even if he sold all of it that wouldn't lead to a 90% drop.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:37:00
Either Bitcoin is going to 0 or it's going to a level much higher than it is now. If you believe Bitcoin has value then the time to buy is during a bear market. Aka now
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:50:43
By far? What separates it that much from the ledger nano s?
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:34:44
Need a banana for reference OP

I think the amount of btc committed to the network is the metric to watch. It's easy to open a channel, but the amount of btc shows the overall trust people have in it imo.
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:11:31
Because a ton of bitcoin is held by exchanges. Who hold the bitcoin of thousands of accounts in only a few wallets. 1 wallet does not equal 1 person.
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:01:39
Next step is to get to 2.1 btc so you can own 1/10 millionth of the supply
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:05:37
Price goes up --&gt; news outlets publish Bitcoin articles --&gt; people Google Bitcoin. Google search trends should mirror price for the most part.
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:52:56
Or moving the btc to a new address to sweep for forked coins. Mostly likely a pretty boring transaction.
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:36:33
This for real. If there was certainty that the price of BTC was going to 50K then guess what? It would already be at 45k+. There is risk and uncertainty and nobody really knows what will happen.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:35:53
Seems like a pretty important prerequisite
