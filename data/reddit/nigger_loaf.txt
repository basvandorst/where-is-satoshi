Sorry you're getting so many downvotes, reddit is an irrationally finicky crowd. The first few votes will seal your posts fate unfortunately.

You'll need an exchange in southeast asia to sell your Bitcoin to so that you get your cash. If you're in India or Taiwan, bitquick.in or bitquick.tw will let you sell free

Bitquick.co since its faster than coinbase and safer than localbitcoins. 
Cash deposit, coins within 3 hours
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:48:04

Where is bitquick.co? 
They are the easiest by far. Cash deposit, few hours wait. They also have proof of reserves.
 Localbitcoins is dangerous and cashintocoins takes days.. wtf?
Didn't mention coinbase either.

Jesus Christ you fucks can't explain shit.
**tl; dr** first understand you can give someone your bank account number and they can send money to you without them being able to take money. To take money, they need your bank PIN. 
The equivalents of this in bitcoin are your public and private keys. They're basically just long (30+) numbers. Your public key is equivalent to your bank account number. Your private key is equivalent to your bank PIN. **A paper wallet is simply printing your public and private keys on a piece of paper..**  is a fine place to make one.
@_date: 2014-12-25 13:48:27
Can use bitquick.co.
Uses cash deposit and you get coins in 3 hours. You gotta wait until a local credit union or bank is open though. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:15:11
Stop creating expectations

@_date: 2014-07-12 21:20:37
Yeah man use 
Never ever a problem. Cash will be put straight into your account with a 0% fee and you set the rate you want to sell at. It's like a streamlined LocalBitcoins (so it never goes wrong)
@_date: 2014-08-26 03:39:23

@_date: 2014-01-14 13:59:29
the article explains it terribly.
it is 1% fee to buy, which will increase to 2% in february and its always 0% for selling.
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:18:33

@_date: 2014-01-19 21:54:45
 
its been flying under the radar but its been open for awhile and has plenty of reviews and is faster than any other exchange now. $10,000 max limit
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:36:42
If you want cash deposit and consistency, use 
Never had an order take more than 2 hrs and you can see their processed trades on bitcoinity. 
Cashintocoins is having delays as large as 2 days and with current volatility, that's impossible to run a stable business
@_date: 2014-01-05 14:34:22
.. can you provide a link to your website or something

Set up your own wallet from a Desktop service:  I recommend Electrum
Buy and sell from 
Bitquick is like a streamlined LBC. Still pay via cash deposit, but you get your coins much quicker and interact with Bitquick support, not the LBC seller.

Easy as hell in America or Europe using  they're definitely the fastest service out there now
1. Place hold
2. Deposit cash at bank
3. Receive $$
Takes buyers maybe 2 hours max. As a seller, I just list my coins and watch the deposits roll in. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:42:18
You can actually do that at https:// bitquick.co lol no problem

I had this exact thing happen to me and all I had to do was contact tigerdirect via online chat and it was solved in minutes. I also sent an email to bitpay support but it wasn't necessary. 
Very very easy

@_date: 2014-07-13 19:22:03

Time to start shorting EBAY lol

use  if you want to sell for no fees.
@_date: 2015-01-16 13:14:17
It's not, it's another lame gimmick by Brock Pierce.
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:54:49
so their current exchange rate is 236.66 EUR/BTC or $270 USD/BTC, 4% above market rate. They also charge an additional 1% for transactional costs.
total fee is ~5% to buy. not too bad.
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:13:43
Holy flying fuck.
**That's $300 mln valuation MINIMUM**
Shit, that's big enough to IPO as a micro-cap or small-cap on NASDAQ.

They've coordinated with GAW miners to create a $10,000 price floor for BTC
@_date: 2014-04-13 05:31:21
No  I do not
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:44:09
convert to BTC and sell those BTC elsewhere. seriously. 
BTC-e withdrawal methods suck and are expensive.
If you have a bank, list them for sale on bitquick.co for 2-3% above bitstamp's price, they'll sell for cash into your bank within a day. bitquick doesn't charge any fees to sell BTC so you'll get 6%+ what you'd get from BTC-e (because the price of BTC on BTC-e is 3% below BitStamp already)
@_date: 2015-01-08 13:13:01
Rest are paid shills
Coindesk is unfortunately one of the worst/most guilty  parties.
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:36:07
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:57:02
what do you mean? what you'd do is create a new sell order on bitquick: 
after filling the form, they'll give you a BTC address to deposit your coins into.
so go back to BTC-e, buy BTC with your USD still on there, and withdraw the BTC from BTC-e to the bitquick address.
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:17:34
I wouldn't do it. I used to sell on localbitcoins until I used bitquick.co
bitquick.co guarantees your cash deposits so you can't get scammed
@_date: 2015-01-08 13:11:44
Thats like saying dont hold dollars because banks can get robbed. The fuck?
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:14:09
Been preaching it. . Bitquick.co much safer marketplace. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:30:28
Moe, this is the only responsible reaction.
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:20:27
like... to which exchange? I don't understand what you mean by "to which trade so I move to"
and bitquick does sepa so it should work ok. are you in EU?
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:48:15
100%, left lbc for bitquick quite awhile back. bitquick guarantees you against scams and doesn't require you to interact with the buyer at all. much more streamlined.
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:18:35
just list them on  and have buyers deposit cash into your bank account or credit union account.
safer than localbitcoins, and quicker than other options.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:27:58
wow blows
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:21:14
Wtf are you talking about it's always been under USD and altcoins.

Fuck it let bitcoin price go moon
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:19:16

I wouldn't do USD withdrawals on any exchange because they charge wire transfer fees.. :/ $25 fee typically from your bank.
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:01:45
Lol everyones a pro day trader
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:51:51
Do you live near a bank or a credit union? Then use 
It's safer than localbitcoins and mycelium (you know you'll get your BTC and don't need to meet up with somebody in person) and faster than coinbase (get your coins from bitquick within 3 hours)
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:48:06
ahh gotcha. in terms of actual exchanges, i'd use bitfinex for trading.
@_date: 2015-01-08 13:11:01

@_date: 2015-04-26 03:50:13
theyre also india, taiwan and europe
@_date: 2015-04-27 20:16:55
Damn, was a nice arbitrage opportunity while it lasted.
BTC-e dollars are worth more than other exchanges. 
Back to normal now though. Don't think anything is "up". Just someone wanted to get their $$$ out.
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:58:13
should have used  
no chance to get scammed. no reason to use localbitcoins

@_date: 2015-04-26 01:02:53
why u think ur innocent?
@_date: 2015-04-26 01:10:44
yep use bitquick.co and a local credit union or bank open on a sunday
@_date: 2015-04-27 20:17:42
$40M isn't that much more than what they previously raised. that's bearish if you ask me.
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:22:20
Are you a paying customer? 
bitgo will likely reimburse you. theyre top notch.
@_date: 2015-04-27 20:19:15
they arent multisig, i'd go with mycelium for mobile or bitgo for desktop.
@_date: 2015-04-27 20:18:40
What is a Blockchain parnter? i thought bitquick was teamed up with Bitgo?
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:32:55
bitgo is a+++

just visit the website: 
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:28:27
Interesting... this is pretty huge!
why r they doing $30 off though? is it rly that much savings on their end because of antifraud and reduced CC fees? is it sustainable or a gimmick?
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:10:19
would love to see it as well, nobody has given lbc a run for their money
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:52:03
been calling it for so long. theyre full of scammers and drug dealers. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:50:30
ohhhh gotcha thx
@_date: 2015-03-23 00:46:28
Yup,  takes cash in USA.
LocalBitcoins itself isnt a scam but is full of them. Just like craiglist.
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:48:16
im a bit skeptical too. it seems to use starbucks gift cards but idk where they source them from or how the cards are legit?

ur making my bitdangus tingle
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:11:43
sure but how can you say it is not the responsibility of the bitcoin foundation? theyre sitting on fat stacks and doing jack shit with it.
hell, even theymos with bitcointalk.org needs to step up.
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:01:11
List them on [BitQuick]( for 1% above market rate and you'll get a cash deposit into your account within 24 hours and more money faster than coinbase or circle can give you
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:12:01
but does the average user really give a crap?
the average user cares about simplicity and usage. As long as the business they use is backed by reputation/investors, the average user doesn't care.
Sure, maybe the libertarian cares about a decentralized platform, but not my mom or dad..
I think coinffeine is wasting their time developing a product targetted towards *current* bitcoin users that will never be adopted by the mainstream.
@_date: 2015-02-19 09:09:35
If only more people used  to get their first bitcoin..takes under 3 hrs with cash deposit.
 these huge companies, circle/coinbase arent newb friendly at all. 5 business days to finish a transaction? Crazy
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:00:46
1%? No way it could be for the exchange. Too higj
@_date: 2015-02-14 05:28:26

Shrekt robocoin at the end lol
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:25:41
ooh, but who will he chose? 
coinbase? bitpay? bitnet?
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:43:56
you really think its that unbelievable? 
you read about horror stories because people talk when bad shit happens. 
that's also why you only read about negative PayPal shit too. obviously the people who enjoy the service arent complaining.
finally, you're on a community of people who love to hate.. (not really a good thing)

Damn, that's cool, congrats guys! Any details?
@_date: 2015-02-14 17:14:45
First time I did  but I wasnt digging the delay.
I recommend  for newbies now. Cash in your pocket, and you're good to go to get BTC the same day. Doesn't get any easier.
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:16:08

can do  but they'll need a drivers license after $400. it is only 3 hours to bitcoin from cash tho
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:06:40
Thr answer is yes. There is nothing to stop them from reading your Pass code when unlocking your wallet
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:22:25
Yeah, it's only a matter of time before you get your ass beat if you constantly are engaging in face-to-face trading. Not to mention, you should probably be doing KYC if you're handling large amounts of cold hard cash.
Use bitquick.co or localbitcoins to sell online at a markup. Bitquick takes care of the KYC/AML for you, LBC allows you to do it on your own.
@_date: 2015-02-07 13:25:13
Yeah or just use bitquick.co or localbitcoins which actually works.
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:28:20
Try [bitquick](
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:42:30
Why dont you just use  ? Pay with cash. Never get a transaction cancelled.
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:45:44
lmfao come on its not that bad.
still.. love it.
also gonna be hard to keep pushing mainstream adoption if we simulateneously compare the process of buying btc to getting ur asshole checked lol
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:24:51
 is a safe web wallet.
It's institutional grade multisignature security and backed by $10mln in funding.
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:29:17
I would recommend BitQuick.co, fastest way to get BTC in 3 hours with cash
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:47:55
Circle and coinbase are going to make you wait 3-5 business days
Use  . Pay with cash, only place that'll get you coins same day (3 hr wait max)
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:19:53
it doesnt. the stupidest thing you can do is make a startup with more than 4 cofounders. 2 is prime. 1 needs to be technical.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:28:53

 - Use bank transfer, wait 5 business days, 0% fee, $2,500 max
@_date: 2015-02-14 09:43:30
interesting, they seem to buy on all the dips.
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:21:38
Holy shit, came to say the same thing.
Its only a matter of time until LBC becomes a craigs/shitlist.
Been using bitquick to buy and sell P2P for a LOONG time so I dont get my ass beat.

You dont have a bank account or credit union account? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:17:21

LocalBitcoins.com is a BUSINESS. It is NOT Bitcoin itself. You must be so ridiculously confused right now. 
23 cents is too expensive for you? Go use PayPal...
Sheesh... and I thought that *I* was the nigger loaf.

Interesting. Well yeah as others have said, that would derail a lot more than just Bitcoin. That destroys the fundamental basis of cryptography.
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:28:40
You want us to say yes but the truth is, only you can trust you with your bitcoin. Keep a reserve of cold storage btc

How does one solve a block?
I actually am the president of a math club at coloroda state university and could recruit brilliant minds to solve these mathematical puzzles. I doubt anyone could solve these puzzles faster.
Where do you submit your solution to the block and who verifies it is correct? 
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:49:28
Yes lol please post the actual link to blockchain.info though.
And thanks mah nigg

Bitcoim retirement service? Haha how the hell have you known about bitcoin for so long but learned so little?
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:32:19
It is one set price. The IBF (International Bitcoin Federation) releases the price of Bitcoin each month which is printed on their journal and sent out to subscribers. Subs are very expensive though so typically the price is just leaked via journalists.
@_date: 2013-10-29 06:48:51
It's zero risk,  so what's to lose? 
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:28:08

Liberty reserve is owned by someone. Bitcoin isn't. You can't shut down Bitcoin. Its not an entity. 
Making Bitcoin illegal would have similar efficacy to the current outlawing of torrenting pirated content. Sure it's illegal, but it's practically impossible to regulate because the entire torrenting system, like Bitcoin, is peer to peer decentralized software.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:05:27
When a block is solved, aren't the 25 btc distributed to everyone? So how come nodes don't get so rich?
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:34:54
u can use SEPA transfer to buy and sell on bitquick.co

anyhow, I can vouch for the dudes over at bitquick. they run an upstanding service.

You're an idiot dude. Ain't nothing wrong with Bitcoin. Only your decision making skills.

They refuse to make their own opinoon.

Noooooooooooooooooooooooo brooooooooooooooooo they take weeks to KYC verify your account.
They might process your $1000 money order but you'll probably have to open a support ticket with CampBX to get your KYC verified and check cashed in.
Check out all the issues people have had:

Unless Bitcoin hits widespread adoption before that happens, Bitcoin could survive on its own.

How easy is it to decrypt the password from a public key? I know it doesn't take long because you can do it with correct algorithms, which is how the silknroad was hacked

OP I'm sorry you're getting so much hate.
Post something negative about Bitcoin,and this subreddit will donwvote you to hell.
I believe you are correct and we are obviously going to drop. Do any of you tardos seriously think the support level is at $800 right now?
I'm still a long term bull, but predicting the small swings isn't that hard in Bitcoin.

Don't forget eBay charges you a 7-10% fee and PayPal another 2.9% and also the buyer does a chargeback. So you lose ~100%!
