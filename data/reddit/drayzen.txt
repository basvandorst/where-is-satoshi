If you remove Google Play, it basically cripples your phone. Hardly worth it, and hilarious that you would use this as a defense.

I used to use Android. In fact, I've owned 6 android phones, with my most recent being a Galaxy S6, as well as HTC One M7 and a Nexus 5. 
In the grand scheme of life, I couldn't care less about about 80mb of my 64GB being taken up by useless apps. There have been plenty of times that a new phone comes bundled with a new service. So yeah, maybe it isn't forced for me to have Google Fit, but since they whore out Android, S-Health is forced. In fact, the amount of trash on a Samsung phone gives Googles Android a bad name. 
Look, Google is great for a lot of things. I truly truly miss their sharing system, as well as default apps and the notification shade. However, I find that Apples stuff just works better, more consistently, better build quality over all, and has superior support due to their retail locations. 
Will I switch back someday? Probably. But since September of 2015 I can say I've been happy with the iPhone despite some missing features. I rarely find lag, I get timely updates, and everything still works as I expect it to. You know, and something I never got from them was how poorly the implemented any sort of swiping in the OS. Apple makes Google look like they don't know how to use an interactive touch screen with how much better they handle finger to screen.

No reason to hate them. Apple is a solid company full of great people just like you and me. At best you disagree with some things, but hate is to far.

So you hate your family for being technologically dumb? You shouldn't hate apple, because they've actually made greater striders to make technology easier to understand, and making it possible for an average person to look further into the box. 
You should direct your ire at your family, not apple.

Please, break down the tax evasion they are participating in.
Don't worry, I'll wait.

I don't feel forced to use anything. 
I use Google Play Music. I use Waze. I mean, I use iMessage because it's convenient, but I also have Hangouts. 
I don't see merit in your main argument.

Wasn't the 4S before iCloud? The same could be said about Android. Before they had cloud services, stuff got stuck on a phone. The benefit of Android is that it can be a USB, but it's not that hard either to plug your phone in, go to iTunes, click a picture and move it to your PC. Hardly rocket science. 
At the end of the day, Apple didn't have SDCards, so it didn't need to be a file storage system, which inadvertently makes it more susceptible to attack, data loss, etc. 
An iPhone would backup whenever you plugged in it, and an Android didn't know what a backup was. I don't know, I see the benefits of both and they are both good and bad and have had similar downfalls throughout time.

Okay, by that logic then Google forces you to use their stuff. Play Store, etc. I mean, it comes with these things. Takes up space. 
Stop playing the ignorant stance, please. 
Furthermore, why would you EVER use something else on iOS if you have access to Safari which can run adblocking while NOTHING  from Google can without root?

This was an awesome thread to read through. Big thanks for the share that got this to the front page. I remember when Bitcoin was in it's infancy, and sadly I was reluctant to invest even though I had a pretty decent job that would have netted me a good return. Well, after a layoff, and taking a job at 1/2 my previous salary, I'm kicking myself for not investing. Either way, fun to read. 
I should get started regardless and see if I can help makes things a bit better on me while I'm interviewing again.
