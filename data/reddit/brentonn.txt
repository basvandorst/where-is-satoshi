Wealth concentration imo is the biggest threat to any economy, the cyclical nature of boom and busts, and taxation creates new opportunities for people to make money. How does bitcoin solve the problem of wealth concentration? The loose monetary policy is causing the bubble. Who cares about transparent creation of money. Bitcoin makes it easier for a few people to accumulate all the wealth and then there is no monetary policy to shake it up. How is that a good thing?

The root of wealth inequality is that some people make money while not having a skill, speculating is not a skill. Some people get rich playing the lottery, some people make money by collecting interest on large sums of money. If money did not exist these people would not be valued by society.

Lets say bitcoin and the blockchain become mass adopted technologies. Most definitley wealth inequality has not been solved, in fact worsened. Comcast is allowed to prioritize internet traffic. No longer cares about netflix facebook and amazon, but goes after coinbase, fees are passed on to consumer and the consumer begs for protection. The government says FU, we had a system like that. A perpetual cycle of altcoins propagates to take the inherited wealth from the previous generation of digital miners who didnt deserve to be rich. Idk call me when a coin proposes to give everyone globally an amount based their age or something.
