There are minimal barriers to entry. Why would there only be 1 or 2 competitors?

Because gold as a store of value has a track record that has stretched thousands of years. Bitcoins do not.

And when a large portion of the user base is given a reason to switch at the same time, what do you think that will do to the exchange rate?

If there is almost nothing to differentiate the crypto currencies why would there be a few runaway successes?

Tell that to MySpace or Pan-Am or any other service that thought they had control of the market simply because they had a large consumer base.

Let's say demand for bitcoins stays high long term. This is an enormous assumption with little foundation, but for the sake of argument I will accept it. What happens when bitcoins are not so rare? What happens when all the bitcoins are mined, and people still demand crypto currencies? What happens to the value of bitcoins when 50 crypto currencies gain wide acceptance? There is absolutely nothing to differentiate bitcoins from other potential crypto currencies aside from the faith of the market.

I think the social network example is extremely accurate because the value of the network is entirely contingent on its user base. Given how rapidly MySpace deteriorated I don't see why the same could not happen to Bitcoin. I'd say it's even more likely given that Bitcoin's user base is incredibly small. Do you really think there are more than a few hundred thousand Bitcoin users out there? So to act like it has been widely adopted is flawed. A user base that small can evaporate incredibly quickly during a downturn.

You just said that for Bitcoins to be useful it needs to be widely adopted. The userbase is the only thing that matters. Its large compared to other crypto currencies, but it doesn't exclusively derive its value from a comparison with other crypto currencies. Its true value comes from a comparison between Bitcoins and all other stores of value.

So then you understand that you have to compare Bitcoins to all other stores of value. When you do that comparison Bitcoins cannot possibly be considered a widely adopted currency. It is not even close.
