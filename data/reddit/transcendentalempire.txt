Doesn't mean that he's not in his own little bubble. You see that a lot with people who are highly specialized in their field. Their life surrounds something, so that something is inherently more valuable to them. 
The truth is that all currency, including crypto relies on trust in the currency itself. Gold is valuable because we have a long history of "knowing" gold is valuable, in reality most of the traits humanity first sought in gold aren't as important in today's society. It's scarcity and it's historical significance has enabled it to be an easy near universal currency.  When we looks at how fast we make technological leaps compared to how old we have   invested with things like gold, I find it hard to believe that crypto will ever be as trusted. The ability for tech to outpace the foundations of currency is too risky for long term money management. It's the same issue we have with electronic voting machines, defence in tech is always just behind the baddies.

Yes, and people still get their credit cards stolen all the time. The reason we still trust in it is that their is a corporation that can he held liable, there's consumer protections that help recoup losses and mitigate debt. What happens to people when their crypto is stolen and there's no proper accounting? It greatest asset, anonymity is also it's Achilles heel. It's hard to trust in a currency when there is no due process when there's an error or theft, most of proof of ownership comes from good legers and old fashioned accounting.

Yes but if you've invested most your life to do something and there's only two places in the country to do it, there's not a lot of choice involved. 
I'm sure most of the people would have loved to join Nasa, unfortunately the agency has been stunted by politicians.
