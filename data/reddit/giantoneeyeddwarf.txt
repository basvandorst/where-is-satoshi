My apologies to the rude individuals on here.  A great beginner cryptocurrency to learn with is over at r/dogecoin.  In very basic terms cryptocurrency is internet money.  Im not saying dogecoin is better.  But they do have a community that is historically more friendly and will walk you through the process of getting started in the world of cryptocurrency.  Ill be honest and say it can be a complicated subject.  If you have any other questions feel free to PM me.

I've always wanted to be a superpower.  
But honestly in all seriousness.  Where did you find these OP?

This would make some sense, since they already hold a majority of the world's wealth.

I've seen some people on here trying to call local stores to see if they accept Bitcoin.  Is this working at all?  What would happen if there was an organization going around trying to get these stores to accept Bitcoin.

No lie, I am working with my small business development center to create something like this.  The problem that I see with bitcoinstarter is the fact people are still not used to bitcoin.  And are kind of "Timid" with jumping into a new currency.  So if we have a currency that they are familiar with like price converter from Bitcoin to USD and have a project that says $10,000 worth in Bitcoin.  People will recognize $10,000 worth of bitcoin, and could possibly be more willing to bit their money down.  Plus, with the way Bitcoin has been rising and falling, 10 Bitcoin would be $10,000 one day, and $8,000 the next.  
I just kinda blurted this out so sorry if it sounds confusing.  I have a few other ideas for this kind of site.  PM me if you want to get in touch.

That is an interesting idea to get the ball rolling ever so slightly.  So what we need is a proactive community to appeal to the lazy masses?
