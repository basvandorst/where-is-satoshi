If you read the article carefully, the miners said nothing about BIP 101. They just said they wouldn't accept a proposal that doesn't have consensus. BIP 101  may have been implied in the context, but otherwise this is a great example of selective quoting.

It's not even necessarily about being selfish, the whole idea relies on people having disposable income that they are basically willing to throw away (i.e. They didn't have to do it in the first place to enjoy the content). Why tip somebody when I have bills to pay? And we are living in a world where fewer and fewer people are going to have disposable income.
But it's a nice way to get the word out about bitcoin, at least.

Someone please explain to me why mandatory 2FA is such a great idea. If someone steals your phone, then you're screwed. And if there is some way to recover access, then this just creates a larger attack surface. Or am I misinterpreting?

Mike Hearn has voiced this possibility. He is (appropriately) concerned about the lack of incentives for consumers to use bitcoin. Most of the current apps and whatnot benefit the people accepting bitcoin. They usually convert it back to fiat so that drives down the price.
Personally, I think what is going to drive adoption is a failure of the major fiat currencies, as well as widespread surveillance and asset seizure by the American government. The latter has already begun and has only increased over time.

Do you recommend any particular apps for that purpose?

This can be done by re-encoding. Wouldn't be 10 digits though.

Yes and in case OP doesn't understand: the blockchain is intended to solve the problem of many actors seeking to verify information about one another (who owns what) without trusting each other. Banks have no internal need for this, they have to trust their employees anyways.

This is an idiotic example, the expected value for the risky option is way higher, ~500 vs 0.1. Same with your other examples.
A more reasonable example would be something like 1% probability 25 XBT vs. 99% 0 XBT, and 100% 1 XBT. Then you are exchanging for higher reward but also higher risk.

log(y) = Alog(x) + C implies y = e^C x^A
So yes, log-log linear means the relationship is polynomial in general.

This is not linear, it's log-log linear (both axes are logarithmic).

How long until people stop saying this and start saying "Bitcoin is backed by **math**"?

It's called an expectation readjustment now.

I just used Gyft on iPhone today - what seems to be the problem?

What exactly are you planning on doing?

I've been buying constantly but this article is a tipping point for me. Until we see some killer app come out this increase is just hype.

Sorry for the late reply - I'll send you my email, not sure I want to disclose the amount just yet.

I mean we're going to need to see some more use-value from bitcoin (new ways to spend it and exchange it) for this recent price increase to be justified. The more it costs the more incentive there is to develop applications, but if developers wait too long people will sell and the price will go down again (barring some crash in fiat currencies).

I didn't say I was selling; at the time I was just not sure if I would continue to buy. Now that the price has settled somewhat I might. I agree weakening fiat is probably going to be the road to success.

Is coinbase any faster than Dwolla &gt; Mt. Gox? I'd like to find a faster way if possible.
