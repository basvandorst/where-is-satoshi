Well I'm done with this subreddit. I use to think Bitcoin was nice because it could be used as a digital currency, but this circle-jerk fest of Libertarians has really put a bad taste in my mouth for it. At this point I would much rather have a digital currency with all the function of Bitcoin in the sense of easy payments and transfers, but under the control of my national government.

I'm a partial small business owner. I'm thinking of getting our shop set up for Bitcoins as well. Any tips on managing this? We already use an Ipad as our register, but I'm sort of lost on the management of the whole thing with prices continuing to skyrocket.

Isn't there a Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver? That's where I got my Bitcoin from a few months ago.

When I was in highschool a few years ago my friends were interested in it and used it because they could buy drugs online. So there's that.

Is it next to your 'Don't Tread on Me' flag?
