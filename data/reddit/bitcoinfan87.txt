never gambled. heck I've never done anything with any of my btc. moved a couple to a blockchain wallet on my phone, put most into electrum, and thats all. Never got response from coinbase why I'm not eligible to purchase btc from them. Nothing.

I guess in theory I have done that since I used electrum on an offline computer to generate my seed and sent all the coins to those address'. Just seems like there's so many address' and stuff to track if I divide each wallet into coins of 10

I paid about $1000. I don't really care about the price. If you believe in btc and the long term price $200 or $1000 is irrelevant. It's a collector item, unique, and worth at bare minimum the value of btc.

If there's a fork in bitcoin, does that make the current set of address' and their value 0 (is a bitcoin fork the start of a new coin)? Not exactly sure I understand what a fork would mean for current holders in the system.

my worry with this is somehow if the seed gets compromised, all the associated address are wiped. So In theory I should have multiple seeds...unless I'm not understanding?

in the US, you can get in trouble for ANYTHING :p. When you break it down, what was he doing? He took a piece of paper and used a sticker to put it on a piece of cheap plastic. Now people (as a workaround) seem to be minting similar coins / bars but NOT loaded with btc or ether, and include with the purchase the paper and sticker to do it yourself at home. No idea if this is the fix, but its happening. Check out finitebydesign

Almost all of my withdraws have sat in pending anywhere from 10 minutes to a few hours. My account and 3 friends I've helped same thing. Eth, btc, didn't matter. They manually approve the requests I think as an added safety feature, but, sadly, don't seem to have the man power to do it in a timely way 24/7. Good luck getting an email response if it's off hours or they're busy.

The rates are very volatile - particularly when an alt is swinging around(currently eth has been on the rise). Lots of people borrowing btc to go long on eth. Last night the rates were anywhere from .2-.7 so it brought in more lenders to meet the demand. Looks like it's just below .1 now, but keep in mind you only see the first x number of orders, not the entire order book where you'd get a sense for the average to better decide on a fair rate. It's possibly there 120 orders below .1% but they're for fractions of a btc = useless. You want to see where there's walls of a 100+btc and that rate to better judge what's happening.

I have been around for a while and also a 'nerd' and find the chain splitting complicated, messy and hard to navigate. Sadly, I don't see bitcoin progressing any time soon.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:39:46
happened to me. Was pisssssssssed. the borrower received the etc. To make the story crazier, apparently other exchanges were holding client eth on poloniex and putting it on loan. total mess! Just be careful. Not saying it would go down the same way this time, but there is precedent. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:44:19


url? not sure which part of that is the name of the company
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:41:44
keep in mind, this is speculation based on what happened last time crypto saw a fork (ethereum/ ethereum classic). If you were simply holding your crypto (eth) in an account, you received the equivalent  amount on the forked chain (classic). Free money! If you were LENDING your ethereum, they gave your ethereum classic to the borrower and you only got back your ethereum once the loan was complete. I was in this position and wasn't too happy. 
Given that this will likely be a contentious fork (if it happens), your best bet is to have tokens on both chains and wait for it to play out to make sure you end up with whichever has real value. If you've got balls, there's some money to be made dumping on the losing chain, but it may not be obvious out of the gate which will long term succeed. 
Also should toss in the disclaimer here - don't hold lots of crypto on an exchange unless you're actively trading. Secure it in a wallet you control. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:33:51
been around for years. Impressive that each year, whenever there's a big hack or drop, they fall less and less. btc getting stronger and less volatile during bad news :)
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:56:42
I THINK the answer is yes. Might be worth reading about what happened with the eth/etc fork for people holding long positions that were open at the time of listing / fork. If you do get the forked coins for your borrowed btc, awesome! Granted, the value (in theory) will be split across two chains if one isn't immediately killed off. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:22:34
ETC was listed on the exchange within a few days? But, i got zilch cause of my open loan at the moment of the split.

@_date: 2016-06-28 19:53:33
thanks for the message. Overall, Kraken just doesn't provide an overall good experience compared to other exchanges. 
1 - I recently wanted to buy a significant amount of BTC and was limited to 10k at a time w/ 1% or $75 deposit fee (other exchanges have better options like wire for free or less $ or smaller %
2 - The UI isn't great. Basic view of order books, a toggle switch for buy vs sell which lead to me losing money by having it set to the wrong position (made a post about a while back and apparently others have done the same by accident leading me to believe it's just a mistake waiting to happen for users with no added benefit. 
3 - Kraken has had a number of times in the last few months where the site returns 404 msgs during busy periods. 
4 - Was on Virtex approved prior to the acquisition and needed to be reapproved - not a huge deal. Then recntly tried to make a deposit and though I'm tier 3 verified or whatever I couldn't make a deposit and needed to submit a help ticket. 
anyway - you get the point. This is not impressive or an exchange I want to be buying from

@_date: 2017-01-03 22:52:15
actually no offers ever. I think people assume that at this point the price of one would likely be fairly high 
@_date: 2016-06-14 16:37:13
The coins aren't really sealed. For example, the 1btc w/ leather case is a cardboard box that has the leather square holder inside. You open that and the coin sits in a circle cutout inside a plastic shell that just pops open easily. The trouble here, is a coin with scuffs and marks may appear to be the fault of the holder and not the manufacturer, so depending which they ship to you, it will limit the condition down the line. 
Also, don't expect timely emailed when there's an issue. Pretty disappointing overall experience tbh, which is unfortunate. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:55:56

you did it through a wire?
@_date: 2016-02-17 19:56:34
that's kind of what I thought, but how exactly does this work? Can't the person just keep following on the blockchain or build a program to follow it around. I get that they won't know who the new address' belong to, but perhaps they have a record of all coinbase / major compliant companies' address' then wait for something to hit and reverse track w/ subpoenas?

Two cents from a young btc investor - I've purchased btc all the way from $23 upt to $1000. Not long ago I decided to add another 50k when I thought the price was down, around $650. Three weeks later the price fell to $450. Another few weeks and it was down in the $300s and a bit lower. Overall, it doesn't change my portfolio or feelings on btc, but everyone who says to put in a little bit each week over a period of time is giving good advice. Advice I wish I had taken and wasn't so young, eager and excited. 
Buy your 5k, but do it gradually and as the price goes up slowly, yes, you'll pay a bit more and have slightly less btc, but if it's going where everyone believes, it won't matter, and you'll feel better about each purchase as the price increases and there's more demand in the market.

what's the point in running a fake node?

I'm pro bitcoin, but these guys just don't speak or present well, given their education and 'status' within the space. It would also be nice instead of them just talking about doing things...to ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. 
I look forward to the product they release and hope it's great.

i cap out at 120g / month. There's a $25 for unlimited add-on. What kind of things in terms of service should I be looking for?

saddens me there are 10 people in the room - half looking down at their phones. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 16:02:02
lol, right?
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:40:16
is this an example or can i collect this?
@_date: 2015-02-07 06:28:35
lol thank you! Though I just recently signed up for changetip and have a feeling I'll end up spending a couple hundred bucks a year tipping people on reddit. Really is nice to be able to show appreciation when you read something that makes you laugh, smile, etc. Better than an upvote. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 08:15:15
hahahahaha I'm going to research how to use changetip just because of this comment
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:00:19
no source it's the truth. that will be the price. I put my life savings, my house, kids college funds into btc so it has to work. it's just gotta!
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:20:47
Anyone who doesn't think the price will be $100,000 by December doesn't belong in this thread. Anyone who disagrees with me is stupid and knows nothing about Bitcoin. The end. This is the truth. No matter what anyone else says is wrong. Trust me.

you know Montreal is nowhere close to Toronto, right? Completely different provinces...

:( I've never felt so nervous
@_date: 2015-02-07 07:46:47
thanks! though I wasn't looking for changetip donations. I was just curious what other people do with weighting their investments. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:36:42
so now you have zero BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:41:58
Up or down a few dollars I don't think is going to matter. We're all buying (I think) on spec that if Bitcoin works the way we all believe, it will be worth much more, and whether you bought coins at $440 or $420...who cares?
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:02:20
Sent you a little something. It's not much, but all I can donate right now to help you get back up and thank you for sharing w/ the community.

is there anything happening in Toronto?
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:57:16
give a BTC address. I'll send you a small something to help you get back up. Won't be much, but I can imagine the crappy feeling you have right now :(

I worry this is the thinking all the BTC people had when it broke $25 and they sold sold sold and now they're kicking themselves.
Ahhhhhhh life
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:30:50
I burst out laughing at this response
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:13:03
If they post a graph every time there's a jump and say "it's a bubble" eventually they'll be right and say "HA! I told you I was right" :p
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:15:37
You got a great deal. Hold on and when they hit 10k you'll laugh at how you thought $900 was expensive :)
Welcome to the club and the family

I bought LTC because I thought it'd good to diversify. You can also aquire many LTC for cheap, so getting a few hundred coins won't break the bank, though I recognize I should be looking at it all in terms of % not price.
