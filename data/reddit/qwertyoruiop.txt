None. you can do that with BTC right now. It's called nlocktime. Make a locktimed tx 12 hours to an address you control, then store the private key of the input address somewhere else. Those coins can be technically spent (but not broadcasted), but that tx won't confirm until the locktime allows it to be confirmed. You can simply make a new tx double-spending any of the locktimed tx's inputs to get funds back before the timelocked tx is confirmed.

Note that at the time it was actually possible to short on mtgox order books via Bitfinex and btc.sx. However Bitfinex moved to Stamp shortly before the gox bankruptcy, while btc.sx honored all trades even as price descended into the 100s on gox. However it was not a direct feature of the market, just secondary markets with integration to the gox book.

just a small note; smashing the vtable is just an exploitation technique, not a class of attacks (which would be *causing* the memory corruption, ie uaf, overflows, races, uninitialized vars etc etc).

Anarcho-capitalism cannot be forced; the only way to make it work is by outcompeting the government at it's own game.
A government is a monopoly on contract settlement that protects itself via coercion. Ancap will thrive only when contract settlement will be handled by a free market. Bitcoin does this successfully for many kinds of contracts, most notably P2PKH contracts, settling them via Proof-of-Work, and anarcho-capitalistic operations are thriving in the bitcoin network. Bitcoin is a free-market, computation-based contract settlement system that protects itself by defining time as a cumulative amount of operations.

Extremely bad example.
For instance, in a free market the owner of the lake would have protecting the lake in it's own interests (to avoid devaluation of the property). This is orders of magnitude more efficient than the government. The core issue is that what is everyone's really is noone's. That's why it's so cheap to dump toxic waste in a lake. Because the value of the lake's property is orders of magnitudes higher than the amount needed to corrupt those in charge of looking after the lake. They have nothing to lose, profits go in their pockets and losses are socialised. 
I want capitalism because I do not want to hold the bag on toxic water reserves in name of "common good". If someone wants to poison their own water, let them do it. As long as they get to keep profits and bear losses.

I am not sure how you expect such a scheme to work. I mean, it would be pretty nice, but unfortunately resources and labour are not unlimited on our planet.
I find it funny that people attack capitalism because "resources are not unlimited so capitalism cant work" when capitalism is the only thing that works in a finite world.
In order to have a smokeless cooking stove someone has to make it, and i don't see why someone that makes smokeless cooking stoves would be willing to give 9 billion of them away for free when they could just do nothing and get a smokeless cooking stove to use for free.

Answers were pretty easy, filled the test. I'd like to know how well I did :)
The question with the sums took me a lot to answer, that's the only q that took me some time to do, not because of it's difficulty (trivial math) but because i kept losing track of the symbols. Haha, I shouldn't have done it at 3am.
EDIT: Shit I took the wrong test, not this one but the old one in the linked post. I'd like to know how well I did the old one, the new one was very easy and didn't ask the kind of questions I'd like to answer if I had to be tested for a job.

It is a choice.
You are fully free to drive in someone's (or your own) roads drunk as you want to as long as they authorise you.
You are also fully free not to drive at all.
The issue here is that the government holds monopolies on many things; long-distance roads are one of them. 
Some say economies of scale play a role as far as roads go and that the government is the only provider of services that is large enough to offer said services. This is up for debate; but in any society I'm aware of you're fully free to drive as drunk as you want as long as you stay in your own property.
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:00:38
You are wrong.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:36:14
The fact that I'm stating the obvious doesn't make drunk driving any less of a choice you are fully allowed to make now as well as under a libertarian/ancap society. 
The difference is that now you have no real competition for roads. So if you want to drive you are free to do so as long as you're not drunk, and that's okay since noone is forcing you to drive. You may want to drunk drive, but if there is no supplier for a road when you can do it and there is no way for you to build your own road to wherever you want to go, then you're simply out of luck. Nobody owes you drunk-driving roads, or roads at all for that matter.
But you're still fully free in my book to do as you wish with your own car, your own body, your own alcohol, and your own road. You are free to substitute "your own" with "someone who authorised you to use their own "
Same thing with vaccines: you're fully free to be not vaccinated as long as you do so on your own property.
When you enter mine, I'd like you to be vaccinated. Or else.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:48:08
This is true, as I said in another reply to a comment on this post, nobody owes you anything, not even drunk driving friendly roads.
If a large enough majority of the market is not willing to drive in a road where people can drink and drive, then said roads will simply not exist.
But no, you shouldn't be FORCED not to drink and drive. There may simply be noone willing to supply said service since it wouldn't be possible to do so at a profit.
But nobody owes you such a thing. It doesn't prevent you from creating such a thing on your own property or via particular deals with regular-road-suppliers. The fact that something does not exist is not coercion.

Drinking and driving should be a choice, yes. 
The issue is when you drive on someone else's property. Then the choice may be up to them, if defined so by a contract.
If someone gives you the right to drive on their property as long as you follow some rules, such as not drinking and driving, and you do drink and drive, then you're breaching someone's property.
Government property *is still* property; the ability to drive on their property is given to you contractually (your driving license).

Yes. An anti-vax group of people is fully free to let anyone not vaccinated to enter their property while others aren't allowed, just as much as a pro-vax group of people is fully free not to let anyone not vaccinated enter their property while others are fully free to enter it at will.
[disclaimer: I'm pro-vax myself].

The children. I haven't specifically spoken about the "what about the children!" since I do not have a definite answer for it. I have simply addressed property rights questions. 
I do agree that vaccines are a good thing; I'm not sure coercion is the right answer. Even in the children case.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:16:23
This is only true as long as public services are, well, public ("monopolies").
Let's say in a few years roads will be all privatised, and let's say there's someone willing to pay a premium to be able to drive drunk.
There are three possible trivial outcomes:
1) Current road owners cash in that premium, allowing you to drink and drive.
2) Current road owners do not cash in that premium, because they'd lose too many clients, thus the drunk driver won't be able to drunk drive unless by violating a contract.
3) Someone comes around and makes a drunk-driving only road with premium fees.
So even if you may not be authorised on *most* roads to drink and drive, if enough people want it, they'll be fully free to drink and drive as much as they want.
But I guess most customers wouldn't want that.
I know me as a customer would prefer roads without drunk drivers for some good reasons.

You seem to misunderstand the functioning of mining ASICs. It would be extremely impractical for ASICs to have all that hashrate on generic data anyway, because it'd be bandwidth constrained. So ASICs do not meet your definition to begin with: they are designed for block headers (i.e. to try nonces) no matter what. They aren't just a generic SHA256 IC.

i think an argument can be made on how it could impact miner profits in turn affecting the network hashrate in turn devaluing the value of BTC itself, although I am not sure.
