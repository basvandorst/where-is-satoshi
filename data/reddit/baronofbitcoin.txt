PoS won't work because it is so easy to fork PoS.
*1) Find top 100 addresses, aka stakeholders
*2) Fork and switch ownership of addresses.  For instance, create a foundation for "Honest And Immutable Coin Holders" and give them ownership.
*3) Tell everyone they have duplicate coins in this new and awesome network.
*4) Go to beach
*5) Profit!!!
In PoW you actually need to do work to secure fork (deploy hardware and use electricity.)  In PoS there is practically zero work to fork.

The problem is Coinbase uses the term 'Wallet'.  A wallet can mean anything.  Blockchain.info is a third party hosted wallet where you can access the private key.  Who knows what kind of service Coinbase provides just by registering.  From the little documentation they have you think their wallet would have the same capabilities as blockchain.info.  Then you are screwed when you need the private key.
Edit:  I don't recommend blockchain.info either.

You have ignored my special case.  I can send coins, counter party tokens, and alt coins to a Coinbase address.  Will Coinbase make an IOU for me for those altcoins I sent?  No, they won't.  Should they?
You make a strong case but my belief is that it won't hold up in court.  Coinbase can always choose to keep an internal record of newly created Altcoins with value.  They can then distribute it to its users kind of like how Poloniex did it.  BTCe said 'screw you' to its users and denied users ETHC.  They are Russian so they got away with it.  My suggestion for private key access is just one 'solution' to this problem.
I guess we can both agree to not completely trust third parties.

I just want to point out Coinbase has a policy to not give out the private key of a regular wallet.  This means should you ever need a private key from their regular wallet then they do not have a system set up to give this to the user.  They won't tell you this, and they just point to their multisig if you complain.
Edit: My point is should you ever need access to Altcoins it won't be possible with their setup.

This is 100% hypothetical but my guess is the company and equipment itself is or will be worthless.  The profit was made from the transaction of the sale.  How?  I've heard how failing businesses have been bought up to hide accounting practices.  Let me explain.  A corrupt country can print fake unlimited fiat of country A.  They exchange that fiat for new fiat from country B that is actually worth something.  The exchange rate is not based on the free market and is fixed because of govt regulation.  So the exchange of fiat result in profit.  They take their new fiat and buy a company to obtain its assets, but more specifically its legal standing.  There are several steps in this process that profit can be made.  On paper everything is legit.

I don't claim to be an expert.  Ethereum did it with the hard fork and rolled back the DAO.  I imagine it can be done again even easier with PoS since miners are not required to bootstrap the security.  It's just a matter of getting enough users for a network effect.
Also,  I was thinking you don't take someone's private keys.  You just say in the code at a certain block "do something" which effectively modifies the history.

$12,000 is actually enough money to not have to work (assuming prices of good and services don't rise when everybody gets UBI).  When I was working fulltime, I wanted to quit my job and live in a van.  You really don't have to work, because you can live with as little as $2-$30 a day.  Ramen is 50 cents.  A bag of rice with 200+ servings is approx $20 which is 10 cents a serving.  You can get a shower for free at the beach or for $3 at some gas stations.  Since there is no individual mandate health insurance is now free.  If UBI becomes real there will be entire industries revolved around this lifestyle.  If you have a partner you both can make $24,000 total which would further make it easier to do nothing all day.  If you have three people that would be $36,000, and you could probably get a $500 room with three beds.  Now, do you want to work at a fast food restaurant, or perhaps work at a farm picking fruits in the hot sun to make more money or do you want freedom, having no boss, and with unlimited free time?  The answer to me is obvious, which is freedom.  Nobody wants to work at a minimum wage job for 4-8 hours a day everyday.  If people were working, they could easily quit anytime leaving the manager of the business in a difficult position.  The possibilities are pretty endless to cheat or abuse the original intent of the system.  I've watched some van life videos and they only work when they money supply runs low.  People complain hobos (people who are able to work but choose not to) don't add value to society.  With an unlimited supply of free money they will no longer have to work and their contributions to society will go further below zero.
I'll think about the book, although it is unfortunate you couldn't site online links to point to facts.  You have to rely on research in a book that is unproven in the real world to get your point across.

1) Stagnant wages;
2) Declining share of GDP going to labor and rising share going to corporate profits;
3) Declining labor force participation rate;
*  **Trump's economy has significantly lowered unemployment to the lowest recorded ever**
4) Diminishing job creation, lengthening jobless recoveries, and soaring long-term unemployment;
*   **Clearly Martin Ford wrote this book when Obama was in office**
5) Soaring inequality;
*  **There is less poverty now than ever before.  Sure, there may be more rich people.**
6) Declining incomes and underemployment for recent college graduates; and
 
*   **College has now become a joke because everyone goes to college and degrees are worthless.  Blame the student loan program for lending out money.  Blame the system for not promoting blue-collar work.**
7) Polarization and part-time jobs.
*   **It's true that there exists a new economy called the gig-economy and people are now working more part time to make ends meet.  Maybe this needs to be explored further.**

I always challenge my views.  I’ll think about it.  UBI will probably happen but I don’t think it is ready until socialism addresses Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.  Food, water, shelter comes first before free money.  Instead of free money why not guarantee food or housing?  If unemployment ever reaches 20% or more due to robots I would consider UBI, until then it’s probably a no.
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:32:49
Right now we have some safety nets already that give away free money through unemployment benefits.  Unemployment checks are given to people without jobs for one year.  This is basically free money.  Obama extended it for a short while during his tenure to 1.5 years.  So, we would know if a severe employment crisis develops if people who are given free money cannot find new jobs.  A severe employment crisis did not develop although many people thought it would happen after Obama's presidency, which was when Martin's book was written.   The fact is that new jobs were created.  But, should the case robots takeover, unemployment benefits is one measure to transition to newly created jobs, and it can be extended for longer time periods.  In theory, if you extended it forever, it could be UBI.
Also, free money is basically given to people with disability.  If you are labeled disabled by the govt you get money.  Many homeless people are put on disability and get free checks and housing.  None of this is really reported but it happens.  Yang believes UBI would make people more creative doing art.  Wrong.  People will start being lazy, doing drugs, protest and just have fun.  How do I know this?  People who are on disability do this and they don't make works of art.
I imagine if you give something for free away, and then take it away, people would be pissed.
Finally, my instinct tells me if you give free money with no time range people would not want to find jobs.  People need a purpose, which is another debate.

There are not enough altruists to support large blocks.  The number of miners is decreasing as the network gets bigger.  Decentralization is becoming a bigger problem.

Blythe Masters is not technical as other Bitcoin CEOs (such who actually know how to code.)  She has money and if she hires the right people, then yes she will be successful.  However, I have not heard of any key hires.  For example, one of Coinbase's key advisors is Gavin.  And companies like  Blockstream recruited two core devs.  BitPay has Jeff Garzik.  So Blythe will end up with second rate bitcoin developers should they choose to work with the bitcoin core.  All the financial sites hype Blythe Masters but I don't see them outgrowing their closest competitor coming out of New York which is Circle (which I don't even use.)

Mining does not necessarily share blockchain data bandwidth to other nodes.  Large scale miners do not have to connect to other peers to share data bandwidth.  Also some large scale miners don't include all the latest transactions in a block and they off load it to other miners.  They will just include one transaction to get the reward which results in delayed transactions and accumulation of orphaned blocks.

I will entertain your thought...obviously, Bitcoin is artificially limited to 21 million coins.  You are referring to the block size limit.  Growing naturally by market demand?

Mr. Falkvinge, of all the people I thought I would respect you have let me down.  I do not know why you are siding with Mike Hearn.  Hearn's core values is against the values of the Pirate Party, your party, which consists of issues such as the promotion of file sharing.  Mr. Cohen is the creator of BitTorrent, the premier file sharing tool around the world.  You disrespect the values of the Pirate Party by disrespecting Mr. Cohen.  Seems to me you are pulling a "Hearn", a term I just coined which means switching sides in conjunction with abandoning core values and joining the enemy.
If you did not know, people like Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, fought for freedom of information in the 1990s.  Dr. Back, a cypherpunk, was pivotal in letting the U.S. gov't know it was wrong in making the export of cryptography illegal.  Now Dr. Back leads the core team in trying to separate money from state.  How can you side with Hearn, a man who sides with bankers, and reject core development?
I expected more from the founder of the Pirate Party.

Also he said, "I plan on using Bitcoins as a convenient, very-low-cost means of exchange...If you only use Bitcoins as a means of exchange, then you don't have to worry much about a sudden loss of faith in the system.". This means he doesn't care if the price of Bitcoin drops.

When a CEO owns shares of his own company professional investors read this as a sign of confidence.  That is why companies perform buy backs and why CEOs and upper management would invest in their own companies.  This is common practice.
I would rather follow someone who puts their money where their mouth is.  Blockstream has publicly voiced their investments. Gavin has chosen to put his money elsewhere.  How much risk one takes is how much one believes it can go up in value.

* Move 1) Denounce Roger Ver's attacks, the ring leader for and the bitcoin.com forums.
* Move 2) Denounce vote brigading on anti-core, pro-classic posts.
* Move 3) Denounce the potential support of both bitcoin core coins and bitcoin classic coins on shapeshift.io should a hard fork occur.
* Move 4) Apologize for supporting Classic while at the same time trying to support Core.
* Move 5) Apologize for supporting 30+ coins other than Bitcoin Core on shapeshift.io including potential scam coins.
As you can see this list is ridiculous, and asking Greg/Core to fulfill demands publicly is outlandish.

The problem is more complicated that than and comparing the hotel room with bitcoins as an analogy has too many differences.  Since you brought it up I will play nice and entertain the thought and try to elaborate on these discrepancies.  On your point  in general, you do not get to pick a miner. More specifically miners can set minimum fees from zero to infinity and your transaction will route to the miner that is willing to put it in a block.  Miners that set their minimum fees to zero tend to confirm slower since there are not many of them that operate on altruism.  In addition, they may not know better because there are spam transactions that could flood their resources and they are too lazy to realize this.  If you set your fee to zero then your transaction will wait in memory until the altruistic/idiot miner finally solves the POW and puts it in a block.  To put it concisely, a cheap transaction fee will route your transaction to a slower if not slowest confirming miner.  So to counter your point, yes, there is a difference in service depending on how much you pay, and in the case of bitcoin mining its initial confirmation time.  You could wait a long time or wait forever.
On your second point in the short term it makes sense to accept an underpaying customer.  But, the hotel has bills to pay and in time underpaying customers will put the hotel in the red and run the company out of business.

Accepting different fees for different types of transactions is a completely different problem that Bitcoin is trying to solve.  Bitcoin is not a general database and should not be.  I can think of so many problems both technical and societal that could go wrong, so many special cases of offering special types of transactions.

It doesn't matter if Bitfury and 21 goes out of business.  During the Gold Rush it was normal for miners to go home empty handed.  Only the most efficient miners will win.  The price of gold still went up.  Bitcoin will become more scarce and will go up in value.

I care about the price of Bitcoin.  I want it to go up.  Big blockers want to use Bitcoin mainly for transactions.  Gavin said he doesn't plan to hodl bitcoins, and he just wants it to be easily spendable.  I hodl bitcoins and Core's plan aligns with hodlers who want Bitcoin to be a store of value.  I believe in free market so I am actually selfish because I want the price of Bitcoin to increase.  Gavin and big blockers want cheap transactions for everyone so to the people may appear noble and righteous.  You got it all wrong.  Bitcoin should be thought of and treated like gold, not like a currency for making transactions.

The blockchain is supposed to be secure and safe.  If you are willing to pay for the services that Bitcoin can provide such as security, decentralization, immutability, etc., then pay to use Bitcoin.  If you want to pay, for instance, to remove ads on a website then use LN.  I expect LN to be better than other off chain services than other companies such as Coinbase can provide.

AVC/Fred Wilson is a Coinbase investor who does not own a significant number of bitcoins.  The way he makes money is on the number of transactions.  Coinbase gets a percent for every transaction made.  Fred/Coinbase/Brian/AVC do not think of Bitcoin as gold, a store of value, but rather as a medium for many transactions.  They don't care about the price of Bitcoin.  Now, we finally know that Fred wants the FBI/NSA to crack our phones.  This boils down to big blocks.

Indeed.  Coinbase was also successful because it was wiling to make mistakes to get there.  For example, Bitcoin transfers took days in the beginnings of Coinbase.  People had problems with depositing and withdrawing money.  The Bitcoin protocol does not have the luxury of making mistakes and there is no "customer support" team to handle and fix individual transactions.  That is why Brian's Silicon Valley growth mentality does not work for critical pieces of software like Bitcoin.  Imagine Coinbase building software for the space shuttle carrying astronauts...it can only end up in disaster.

Thanks for the response.  However, your response is pretty typical in the blocksize debate.  The pressure you speak of is caused by Mike, Gavin, and Jeff because they are able to write blog posts and tweet.  It's like a politician that campaigns forever, but doesn't actually work.  I am disappointed that you don't see the bigger picture, but instead see what people need in the short term.  Yes, people want microtransactions.  People want it fast and cheap.  I'm all for fast and cheap.  However, raising the blocksize will not make bitcoin transactions confirm instantly, and it will still take about 10 min for a transaction to confirm.  People want bitcoin transactions to be cheap but that requires hardware and miners to be deployed, which costs money.  An on-chain solution is more expensive than an off-chain solution.  That is why LN must be developed because it will not require the computation of SHA256 and will be *off-chain*, and it will be *instant*.  If you truly side with ideas then think about the bigger picture instead of short term needs.  95% of all of the technical people agree with Core.  Gavin, Mike, and Jeff has been misinforming the non-technical people and is splitting the community.  Mr. Cohen is an expert in P2P networks.  As the leader of the Pirate Party you should listen to him based on his merits.
In addition, Core wants the system to be decentralized, which is a core tenant of P2P networks and file sharing.  Mike, Gavin, and Jeff want to centralize bitcoin. Certainly you can understand that.

@_date: 2016-01-15 20:18:55
First and foremost, R3 directly contradicts Satoshi's principles.  Satoshi wrote in the genesis block, "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".  Satoshi wanted money to be free from centralization, specifically, free from government and banks.  That was why he modeled bitcoin from gold.  The fact that Mike works for R3 directly contradicts Satoshi's words.  R3 is a consortium of 12+ big banks attempting to maintain  the current distribution of power between government, bankers, and the elite.  The video confirms the direct involvement of the R3 managing director, Charlie Cooper, with Mike Hearn.
Mike also contradicts himself because he claims that the current bitcoin powers are centralized to core developers and miners.  The fact that he works for a centralized company, R3, contradicts his departing words of wanting decentralization.
Mike also claims that no one seems to know what is going on because bitcoin used to be an open community and that it is now being censored.  What is even worse is that no one knows what is going on at R3 since it is a private company, and this is yet another major contradiction.
Edit: One last contradiction...Charlie Cooper claims Mike Hearn was a core developer.  Mike was never an active core developer.  He only wrote bitcoinj.

Imagine in the year 2036 of 8GB blocks every ten minutes.  Only the elite would be able to handle the hardware resulting in centralization to a couple of miners.  If you want a centralized solution one already exists and it is called Visa.  Also, Core uses a softfork while other solutions require a hardfork which could result in bitcoin users losing their funds.

Thanks for looking out.  If you are looking far into the future based on the past then all currencies most likely will come to an end.  The question is when.  That article is two years old and Litecoin is still around.  Should Core change its POW that means bag holders will have two set of coins to spend in two networks.  The market will price the coins.  It is my opinion that Classic will be initially priced higher due to the mining and exchange cartels.  Since there are twice as many coins the value will probably split nearly evenly between the two.  But the Core coins will slowly regain its value due to maintaining its root philosophies.  In addition, Core has a team of developers to implement features that Classic will have a hard time keeping up due to Classic's mediocre developers.  Again, this is only my opinion and I am willing to risk buying or renting servers to mine as much as I can in the hopes of a bigger return.

Of course because there are still mining rewards and they can still profit from the rewards while including 0-fee transactions.  When the reward decreases mining will make less profit and fees will become more important.

His technology is in a position for memory increases so he has no qualms about increasing the memory size.  He may not realize it but he is indirectly promoting his mining hardware at the expense of other miners.  Agreed, that it's mainly about bandwidth and latency.  The bitcoin ecosystem relies on no one controlling more than 50% so I can see your point of view of not hurting the Chinese competitors to oblivion.
@_date: 2016-01-02 06:52:59
Good question.  When I say decentralization I mean the decentralization of miners.  Miners run Bitcoin core software.  The more miners there are the more decentralized the system.  Satoshi designed the system to be decentralized so a government cannot take down Bitcoin by shutting down a server.  For example, the government has shut down EGold in the 1990s because it was just a single company.  However, to shut down Bitcoin you would have to shut down all the miners distributed around the world.  Right now there are 10-20 Bitcoin mining companies, but there needs to be more to decrease centralization.  If the block size is increased too fast then it would decrease the number of miners because only the miners with the best hardware could mine.  As mining chips approach the 'end' of Moores law more mining will be in the hands of consumers.  A big block will not allow mining chips to be embedded in consumer products.  Core supports a smaller block increase in a reasonable time frame.

Yes, there are lots of questions about Mike Hearn.  He has been quite conflicted the past year, but he has publicly made a decision and announced it.  His divorce from bitcoin did not take one day, but instead took at least several weeks to get the photographer to take pics, the New York Times article to get written, and his superiors to get on board.  Is this sneaky?  Yes, in that he did not act alone in his decision and a team of people is making a coordinated effort to undermine bitcoin while promoting R3.

FYI, I am pro-core.  Definitely, Classic, XT, Unlimited are a minority.  Unfortunately,  it is possible this minority is in collusion with the miners.

Now that every normal person is on-board bitcoin Roger has a need to be against the system.

Yes, I agree.  Timeline says April but it could activate later.  I think that Core is ready to act of the network gets congested.  Here's what Gregory said, "In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches

evoorhees is wrong.  Roger Ver is desperate because he harbors a lot of anger.  He would rather have the United States government dismantled because the U.S. ATF put him in prison than have bitcoin succeed.  In fact, the reason why he got into bitcoin in the first place was to get his vengeance with the U.S. government.  Bitcoin is bigger than his vengeance.  Roger Ver has a short term vision for bitcoin whereas Core is thinking about the long term vision by taking secure and conservative steps to development so the long term vision of a one world currency is possible.  People like Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, and Brian Armstrong want an expedited development path for bitcoin because they have angel investor/venture capitalist mentalities of Silicon Valley.  This is the wrong mindset to have because growth at all cost should not supersede security at all costs.  There is a reason why agencies like NASA have level five code reviews where source code goes through an intensive examination process.  The bitcoin protocol is a base layer protocol that deserves utmost security, diligent design, careful consideration because it cannot afford to make a mistake that could inflict damage to a $10 billion economy.  Roger Ver should be ashamed of himself and should hide under a rock for attempting to influence technical decisions that should be decided by technical people.  He also should have learned to stay in the shadows after what happened with that 'other coin.'

Why are you inline with Mike Hearn (and thus R3) who is creating a panopticoin?  Seems like you are supporting government surveillance.  Why are you against the founder of pirating software founder Bram Cohen?  Based on these observations are you socialist disguised as a libertarian?  You claim to be siding with ideas and, in particular, big blocks.  Why do you support centralization instead of libertarian values of decentralization?  Are you a liberal?  I'm very confused what the Pirate Party actually stands for.  They claim to support direct democracy but with the support of big blocks you are supporting miner centralization, which is the antithesis of a direct democracy.  In addition, centralization reduces open access and open data, which is clear from the creation of private network layer designed to detect newly created blocks.  Finally, centralization could further lead to increased government surveillance.  
BTW, I don't expect a real answer except one that a politician makes.

Falvinge is a joke.  He calculated that bitcoin was $1.12 when it was worth $142 and headlined his article that bitcoin was "vastly overvalued".  
Falkvinge said, "*...one bitcoin, as backed by exchange of products and services in its role as a transactional currency, is roughly one US dollar and twelve US cents. And that’s still a generous estimate.
Oops, again.
It’s not hard to see why I use the words 'vast overvaluation', seeing how one bitcoin is currently trading at 142 USD.*" 
He has said he is "all-in" several times over the past few years but he never says anything about selling all of his bitcoin for profit/loss.  He is not a HODLer.  I'm ok with him hyping bitcoin but don't believe a word he says on anything else, especially on SegWit, and anything technical.

My theory is that the miners are now electric companies that buy equipment from bitcoin miner hardware manufacturers.  The manufacturers are up-to-date with the latest tech but the electric companies just want to plug and play the hardware.    What this could mean is that once equipment goes out of date the electric companies will be forced to throw away their old equipment and buy new state-of-the-art miners from the manufacturers.

Do not give credit to someone who does not deserve it.  Falkvinge is a politician riding the waves where it is convenient for him to gain political traction.  He has no principles.  Yes, he founded the pirate party but his policies has since strayed very far from the organization.  For example, he claims he is a libertarian but promotes the socialist policy of basic income.  I feel he became a big blocker because he wanted to create noise and promote himself, ignoring the libertarian, conservative values of having small blocks.  Falvinge is a politician through and through.

Before Trump came to office corporations had a lot of money offshore.  Why?  Because they didn't want to pay US taxes.  Trump lowered the corporate tax from 35% to 20% allowing companies to repatriate their money easier, and to ultimately invest in the US economy.
People always find ways to cheat the system.  People cheat with welfare, food stamps, free housing, etc.  If you are creative you can cheat Yang's system and effectively do nothing.  For example, find four roommates total.  That's $4000 a month, or $48,000 a year.  "The 2018 Poverty Guidelines for a family of four is $25,100."  You can pay rent, buy food, grow some weed on your free time, for four people.  So Yang is actually paying more than poverty wages if you combine UBI from several people.
Of course stores are closing due to Amazon.  Clothes washers also went out of business when washing machines were invented.  If you stop ignoring reality unemployment levels right now are at their lowest ever at around 3.5%.  Yang formulated his game plan when Obama was president when unemployment was over 10%.  Yes, people lost jobs to automation, but they found new jobs, hence the lowest 3.5% unemployment in decades.  Yang was betting Trump would not create jobs because the socialist was listening to the misinformed pundits and fake experts.  The fact is new types of jobs are created when old jobs are lost.  This has been happening since the dawn of civilization. 
 The root of the problem is not automation; in fact, UBI is a non-solution to a non-problem.
If you want people to stay home, be lazy, and do drugs, then UBI is the answer.
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:32:49
Yang will destroy America.  Imagine being a student living at home.  When you become 18 you will get $1000 a month.  Should you get a job flipping burgers for 8 hours a day at minimum wage?  Of would you want to stay home and live with mom and dad with an income of $1000 a month?  Many students would choose to stay home, not enter the workforce, be unproductive, and have no purpose.  People will start protesting for fun, doing drugs, and be lazy.  This is the America Yang will bring us if he is ever elected.
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:05:00
The evidence I have that people will stay home and be lazy include people with disability.  They get free money from the gov't and most of them don't really do anything.  Yang says people will start doing art, but most people on disability don't do art.  Also, most people on disability don't return to the workforce.  Also, there have been UBI experiments in Finland and Canada.  In Finland, UBI showed no improvement in work status.    In Canada, it "didn’t help residents become independent contributors to the economy". 
So in these examples, people stay home and be lazy, meaning many won't work and contribute to society.

There is a good reason why Amazon pays $0 in taxes.  All of their profits goes towards growth if the company.  This makes sense because Amazon is doing something right by providing a service that people want.  Amazon is reinvesting most if not all of their profits to grow the company.  U.S. tax laws were created to provide incentive for growth.  Amazon is making commerce more efficient, revolutionizing merchandising, and deserves to reinvest their profits for growth instead of paying taxes.  Imagine if Yang takes their profits through taxation.  Amazon would grow slower or not at all.  I would rather have Amazon grow because they earned it than give their tax dollars to the inefficient government, or to people who don't want to work.

Many ways to be profitable.  Bitcoin could go up in value and all miners could win temporarily.  They will have to upgrade or buy new equipment to stay afloat.
Most mining companies have gone bankrupt.  The bottom line is cheap electricity.  If you have access to cheap electricity then you are viable.  If you are in a warm región you will have cooling expenses.  Therefore you competitors have an edge.
If they have found cheap electricity they can be profitable but it doesn’t sound long term.

It narrows it down.  The hacker would just need the 24 seed phrase, and then he/she would just bruteforce your numbers-only passphrase in seconds.  So if the hacker got a hold of your seed then it would be less effort to get your bitcoins.
Also, there have been claims where the seed can be extracted from the Trezor using custom extraction hardware.  A passphrase would protect from this attack.  However, I don't think this is the case in your situation since your Trezor seemed to be protected from hardware access.

Where is the data that Republicans blow up the debt and Democrats shrink it?  Seems like you may have been reading a lot of fake news.
Republicans cut taxes to force the government to shrink.  (Reagan and Trump cut taxes.)  This can cause debt, but only because they can't tax as much to pay off the debt.  Democrats creates policies to borrow money and/or inflate to pay for social programs.  Bill Clinton made it easier for banks to loan money and it created a housing bubble, and made it very prosperous temporarily.  However, with every bubble comes a crash.

Yes, I do believe that Republicans want to shrink government and they use many methods including tax cuts to do so.  This is logic.  Less money for the government means they have to stop hiring government employees and fund less government infrastructure, regardless if the tax cut was for the rich, the middle class, or the poor.  Less taxes means less power.

Physical coins are not a form of credit.  Transferring physical coins is not credit.  The promise to pay with a physical coin is credit
Big blockers want Bitcoin to be like credit, not more like money.  LN can make Bitcoin like credit, but Bitcoin needs to be a money before a credit network can be built.
Good monies are decentralized (gold) and hopefully Bitcoin.  Physical coins have failed when govt has failed due to centralization.

So Jeff says 90% in BIP 100.  The he made another BIP for it on 'Classic' and Toomin rejected it.  I bet if they change that number again you will change your arguments to the new number.  What is even scarier is the high possibility the 75% number was pulled out of thin air by Toomin before he was demoted.  Then Gavin continued to use the 75% number because it was convenient.  It is like a circus with the freak show as the main event.

FUD was also produced by other Bitcoin people in high positions.  Eric Voorhees would say that at the pace of Classic support that it was possible it was inevitable.  Brian Armstrong said similar comments on his Twitter feed.  Now Gavin is writing articles to prepare people for the 2MB as if it were going to happen.  They are trying to create an illusion that it will happen when they truly have no idea.  Remember that Gavin is a paid advisor to Coinbase.  So he may also have an agenda too close to Armstrong for comfort.

In addition to fees, Coinbase does AML which strikes at the heart of how Bitcoin is supposed to work.  They are closing accounts of gamblers.

Coinbase has an 'easy' interface that allows you to buy bitcoins but they take 1%.  Kraken is a pure exchange so the fees are from .26%.  Kraken is more for pro-users.  Coinbase also has an exchange but I think Kraken's exchange is better than Coinbase's.  Kraken has more features just in case you want to try a little trading.  Kraken is not really a wallet service.  You should use your own wallet anyway instead of storing it on Coinbase.  Some people may prefer wallet convenience over security.   If so then get a Trezor or use something like Mycelium or CoPay.  This may be intimidating to some users and I hope someone other than Coinbase can make it easy to use.

The more accurate statement is big blockers want free things and not pay for it.  The actual cost of a transaction is more than $30 USD due to the nature of broadcast networks.
Of course they don't want to do AML.  They are part of the system.  The system controls them.  Bitcoin was designed to work around systems.  It does relate to blocks.  Bigger blocks mean centralization.  Centralization means easier to do AML.

If you invest $10k and it makes 7% a year in a 2% fee fund, the fund will take 44% of your profits.
Beginning balance: $10k
Ending Balance: $25834
Profit: $15834
GBTC takes $6972
$6972/$15834 x 100 = 44%

1) Liquidate Roth IRA.  Pay income tax 10% or 15% or 25% ...  Pay 10% penalty.  Invest $ in bitcoin directly.  Then pay 15% LT gains tax when you sell in 20 years.
2) Invest in GBTC using Roth IRA.  Pay Barry Shillbert 44% fees
 in 20 years.  No taxes.
If your tax rate is 10% then it would be better to liquidate your Roth IRA and buy bitcoin directly.

Let's say there is a high demand for GBTC shares.  People buy shares and the share price exceeds the current bitcoin price at, for instance, the Winkdex price.  The "Authorized Participant" for the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) says, "I can make money off of this."  So the AP buys bitcoin at Winkdex prices from various exchanges.  Then the AP goes to the BIT and says, "I will sell you these bitcoins at Winkdex prices if you give me X shares in GBTC."  The BIT says, "Ok, here are some GBTC.  Thanks for the bitcoins."  The bitcoins are added to the trust.  The AP can sell those GBTC for USD which give him profit.   This will give an indirect arbitrage mechanism.  Am I right? :P

Ok.  Seems like the entire Wallstreet commodity trust model is a big scam.  They attempt to price the ETF/trust to align with the commodity as close as they can but it is impossible in the long run because the commodity held in the trust always goes to zero.  GLD, SLV, GBTC are long term scams.  No one should hold these long term.
On another note what could be worse is that GBTC charges 2% which places itself in the high expense ratios within mutual funds.  GLD is 0.4% and actually requires physical storage.  SLV is 0.5%.  Two percent is swindle-like.

I think the legal limit is $1000 USD per day per person.  If Burt surpassed $1000 USD in a trade then you would need an MSB license.  It is not legal but is it moral?  That another issue.
"An activity threshold of greater than $1,000 per person per day in one or more transactions applies to the definitions of: currency dealer or exchanger; check casher; issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value; and seller or redeemer of travelers' checks, money orders or stored value. The threshold applies separately to each activity -- if the threshold is not met for the specific activity, the person engaged in that activity is not an MSB on the basis of that activity."

This may be a contrary opinion, but this could be considered good news for the economy, and yes it does weaken the dollar.  There is currently high employment, the highest ever and most businesses are making money.  Estimated taxes were due last Monday.  This means corporations and small businesses paid so much taxes that banks didn't have enough money to make responsible loans.  So the Fed comes in and gives them cash (maybe in return for bonds) so they can continue to make loans.  The economy then continues to churn.
Some claim in this post that the dollar is not devalued.  I think this is false.  Banks are selling their treasury bonds back to the Fed for cash.  The cash the Fed gives to the bank in return for their bonds are created out of thin air.  Note that the bond was probably also created out of thin air in the first place.  It also depends on how the bonds were sold back to the Fed.  So depending on how the transaction was done the money supply is increased after this injection.  Increased money supply means a weaker dollar.
That's how I read it.  I'm tired of these news articles being sensational and not telling me exactly what is happening.  Mostly fake news!

Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik walk a thin line concerning legality.

It really depends.  For the TSX Canadian exchange it is in increments of 100 if the price of the stock is less than $1.  For the OTC markets, like the one GBTC is listed under it seems like the minimum is 100.  I guess we'll see for sure in a few days. I wonder if it is possible for sites like ETrade to aggregate orders so it appears that you can set orders for less than 100 shares.  In this case the order will just sit there before actually executing as it waits until 100 shares are ordered.  Never say never.

Even the name itself, "Classic", is deception and is purely political.  He causes angst among the community causing divisiveness.  He writes about the "Upcoming Fork" as if it's going to happen trying to make a hard fork happen.  This is not civilized and not calm.  I imagine this to be the equivalent of forcing a policy change upon the people and subjecting people to the equivalent of eminent-domain-like policies.
Concerning your point of name consolidation from Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin, I think your mind is highly malleable in convincing yourself to twist the trust because I read and understood the exact opposite.  They are, in fact, trying to go from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Core.

A lot of people sold their bitcoins during the Classic hostile takeover attempt a few months ago.  Those that sold lost value in their net worth, and Gavin is to blame for causing panic.  Bitcoin price is now nearly double of what it was during the takeover attempt.

The difference between a lawsuit concerning psychic powers and a lawsuit with alt coins is that you can most certainly convince a jury that Coinbase was reckless in not managing possible alt coins.  Users who run their own wallets would be able to manage their alt coins.  Coinbase is a central wallet and cannot simply discard alt coins without upsetting users.

If Coinbase were found to be an an accomplice in a hard fork it would be very easy to create a lawsuit to implicate them, for instance, of not managing any possible alt coins that could have been created from two forks.

Imagine you had a board of directors and one of the board members is involved in a company that is in direct competition with you.  Normally, the other board members  would ask that particular potential adversary to resign.  If there is no resignation it causes an uneasiness within the board, and it eventually forces the board to vote to boot the adversary off.  This is exactly what happened when Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, was on the board of Apple.  Eric Schmidt gracefully resigned because of the growing rivalry between iPhone and Android.  If he hadn't resigned he would have been voted off.  Similarly, Gavin was asked to relieve his commit access, but he did not therefore resulting in other contributors feeling unease.  Removing Gavin was the right move last year, last month, and a few days ago.  Gavin could have exited gracefully, but instead forced the hand of other contributors.

First of all, it seems like we agree that it was a takeover attempt.    What we are disagreeing on is with the word "hostile".  According to dictionary.com one of the definitions of "hostile" is, "not friendly, warm, or generous; not hospitable."
1.) "Classic" is not really "classic" is and a lie attempting to trick new users by using the term in the name to representing something that it is not.
2.) Gavin wrote blogs to trick people into believing the fork was inevitable.
3.) Back channel lobbying, phone calls to CEOs, rallying the masses to fight Core, not telling the masses to stand down from attacking Core and letting it continue.
4.) Using funds from elite, rich people to spin up instances of Classic and proclaiming it's taking over

This has been debated for 3 years.  A single person should not have to do it weekly, but the number of persons running Core should be steadily increasing.  It is not.

The analogy of the walls is just an ELI5 and is not 100% congruent to the real situation.  My counter argument is the wall is made from a material that's has expenses that do not grow proportionally with the radius of the area because the wall is very thick and not a 2D imaginary line like your theory likes to assume.  It does, in fact, grow proportionally to the square of the radius.
Centralization is evident from the continuing reduction of Bitcoin nodes in its current form of 1 MB blocks, which big blockers have a hard time hearing anywhere on the Internet.  The fact is the number of users have been increasing but nodes have been decreasing, which decreases security.  In addition the number of miners has been dangerously low.

Everyone knew a second coin could result from a fork and I myself have mentioned it many times.  However, Gavin, Brian Armstrong and other big blockers completely ignore it and ultimately lack vision, time and time again.  I'm keeping count and Gavin has been wrong on big events including: making fun of people buying Bitcoin at $30, the idiocy of proposing XT, siding with Mike Hearn and then agreeing he rage quitted (shows he is not a good judge of character), exposing the wrong Satoshi (easily fooled and even flew to London to meet him), incorrectly verifying Genesis Block signing, ignoring the possibility of a second coin after a hard fork, and so on.
Brian Armstrong is a delusional optimist thinking everything will 'just work' and that there is nothing to worry about after a hard fork.  For example, Brian declared success within hours of Ethereum's hard fork. These so called 'leaders' lack vision and principles.  They are reckless because of their meddling with economies with disregard to their aftereffects.

The fact that it is turtling stems from the fact it is antifragile.  Maybe you just don't like turtling.  Lots of people just want to get rich quick.

I've been putting some thought into what I said and it's becoming clear.  Mined Bitcoins are more valuable than ordered Bitcoins because it will eventually be easier than buying.  When you order bitcoins there is friction so some value is lost. When a machine mines a Bitcoin it retains more value.  So it is possible it would make sense for a machine to mine it's own coins if the ASIC chip is highly efficient or equally efficient to other competitors.  Bitcoin mining chips are approaching the end of Moores law so chips should end up cheap and could be as common as CPUs.
So plants convert sunlight to chemical energy because evolution has found this easiest path.  Analogously, Bitcoin mining chips will be the easiest path for value production.

Ok.  I guess it also depends on whether BTCC keeps records of who bought which block.

For me PoS is easy to compromise.  Get some major exchanges to change the top holders in the blockchain.  Go with new stakeholders.  Fork it if necessary.  No miners or hash power required to keep it secure.  Too easy.

Bitcoin is more anti-fragile.  Bitcoin is more immutable.  Ethereum can't compete on these two qualities of bitcoin.

Hedge fund buys these blocks.  Puts it in bank safe.  Or, hedge fund hires Bitcoin expert(s) and pays them a salary to design method to split and maintain the private keys.  Which is more cost effective?  Same?

No kidding.  When Gavin says he wants XT, what he really means is he wants 1-5 central servers to running bitcoin with absolutely no chance of going back, which is the complete opposite of decentralization.  Bitcoin is already at dangerous centralization levels, but what is different is that anyone with $1000-$2000 can still buy some hard drives and start up a node.
In addition, other bitcoin implementations are dishonest because they claim to be only 2MB fork but it's about control to become XT.  Or, it's altcoin supporters attempting a false flag attack to grab market share.
