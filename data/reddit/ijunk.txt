A pool/miner can put whatever transactions in their block they like. If they don't include low fee transactions in their block then they're just leaving the money for someone else to pick up.
Also some miners/pools will included 0 fee transactions simply because they believe it's good for the bitcoin ecosystem at this time.

It was a pretty glitchy exchange, I always felt like I was right on the edge of losing my money when I used it.

Market forces dictate how much it costs to get a transaction into the the next block. Right now we are nowhere near that limit so transactions are practically free. As we approach those limits the fees will go up... but there's no reason to think it will settle at any particular price.
