It's blind to think that swapping Reddit accounts stops the G from knowing what you do online. 
It's dumb to think that you're in any danger for talking about bitcoin.

He is a paranoid weirdo who generates new Reddit accounts every week for god knows what reason. 
The Rothschild's don't have trillions, that's silly.

I used some bitcoin for the first time yesterday and it was a nightmare. A fifty dollar transaction took 45 minutes to clear and cost me 5 bucks for that priveledge. Are things like god going to get better or worse if bitcoin gets bigger? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:11:54
By executing anyone who has deposited money onto coinbase of course. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:40:06
Who wants to pay those transaction fees though? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:38:52
My lord guys you aren't going to get executed for having bitcoin. 
They'll just shut it down if it ever becomes a problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:46:51
Dude just scare quoted "the economy".
