The makers of this product are saints! I mean they're exchanging their gold, with intrinsic value, for paper that doesn't.

Anybody have a link to the full interview or know what this event was called?

Ah okay this only works if the assumption that a bad PRNG exploit was used. Thanks, now it makes sense.

Probably playful sarcasm.

Could you explain this in a little more detail. I don't understand how/why he has the private key to the thief's account.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by centralized? You mean one large mining pool operation or something else?
I'm thinking the ASIC folks are like Amazon.com. They have massive market share/power but are dependent on USPS, UPS, Fedex, etc who are this new POW. Amazon is large enough where they just start their own shipping company because it's cheaper than being dependent on somebody else.
If there are these massive banks of ASICs that can't perform this additional POW wouldn't they simply buy up hardware that can? I don't see how this helps anything...

Would somebody be so kind as to ELI5?

Last weeks episode was leaked early. It's very likely they have the rest of this season GOT episodes and maybe outlines/scripts for next. 
My guess is they aren't worried too much about GOT being spoiled this season. They are worried about next season and other projects that are in development. I believe something like 1.7TB of data was stolen which could represent hundreds of millions in development costs.

Ah, thanks for clearing that up. Just assumed it was a result of the hack because of the timing.

Who do you recommend?
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:55:46
The miners I believe.

What about collisions though...

She hodls!

Care to elaborate on how you think the blockchain can solve that type of problem? 
I saw a post about [Bloom]( and haven't gotten around to researching it yet but it looks like it's designed to solve that sort of problem.

Is it actually the same Greg Egan or you making a joke?

Is this address special (ie not allowed to send funds from) or is it just know the key was lost?
