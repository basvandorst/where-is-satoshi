I also had a similar theory that maybe people were spending time on vacation/with families etc for the holidays which explains the lower volume/price.  
Then I looked at last year's December chart.  It does not look the same.  Last year, the price continued to increase.

In the last couple months I got some at like 3900, then at 4400 I thought it was too high but I spent hours watching it hover around 4300-4500 trying to figure out if I should buy more or not.  I did not buy any since it was so "high".  
What's the point?  
1) Looking back, what I thought was high is actually low compared to now.  You have no way to know what will happen.
2) I wasted a lot of time watching charts and stressing out for nothing.

should I keep them in my wallet?

I bought a ledger nano s.  But I hear trezors are good also.  So basically what you will be doing is putting dollars into coinbase, purchasing btc, sending it to your hardware wallet.  YOU are your bank basically.
Keep in mind that when you have your own wallet (instead of using coinbases), you are trading one risk for another.  You no longer have to worry about coinbase going out of business.  However your new risk is what happens if your house burns down?  So to mitigate this risk, you need to think about how you can protect your wallet..  
Once you get a hardware wallet, as part of the setup process it will ask you to write down 24 recovery words on a physical piece of paper.    If somebody has these words, they can get access to your crypto(even without your hardware device) so it is important to keep this in a safe place.  Where am I going with this?  Well say your house does burn down along with your 24 words.. if you had left a copy of these words with say your parents, then you'd be able to buy a new hardware wallet, put the 24 words in recovery mode and get access to your crypto.  You may be wondering how your crypto could magically appear in your new hardware wallet..that is beyond the scope of this discussion.  The short answer is that crypto isn't actually stored IN the wallet.  The "private keys" to access your crypto are stored in the wallet.  Don't worry too much about that for now.
Anyway getting back to the point, you want to store your 24 words in at least 2 places since one of them could be destroyed by a disaster.  Maybe you are super paranoid and want to have 3 or 4 copies in various places.  That is fine too.  Another example would be to store them on a piece of paper in a safety deposit box you can rent from a bank.  Or store them with your grandparents safe or basement or whatever.
If you are really paranoid and don't trust the people who you give the 24 words to, there are other things you can do to protect them.  Maybe you add another random word somewhere in this list and only you know which word it was.  
Hope this gives you some ideas.  Another thing you can google for "cold storage wallet tutorial" which is the cheapest option since you don't need to buy a hardware wallet but it is more inconvenient.

thank you! The generic advice on their website doesn't give any specific numbers.

instead of storing $10 in your wallet at home you decided to give it to a bank to hold onto for you (coinbase).  then we find out the bank was evil and stole your money then went out of business.  your $10 is gone forever.  you may be thinking "coinbase is a big company and that would never happen".  I suggest you read this:  especially the second sentence.

you can google for "crypto mixer" which are services that attempt to obfuscate transactions.

I did the same thing two days ago.  Usually I immediately see it as unconfirmed in electrum but this time I saw nothing and started freaking out.  It eventually appeared in electrum..it took a few hours.  So no need to get worried yet, just be patient.

red = conservative, anti-government, low taxes, less population, money goes further.  blue = liberal, love government, high taxes, higher population, money doesn't go as far.

props to the speaker for standing firm.  the questioner was going in circles and the mc should have stepped in earlier to stop it.
