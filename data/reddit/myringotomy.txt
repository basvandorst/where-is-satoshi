It's very difficult to buy. It's not like you can write a check out slap down your credit card and get some. Some exchanges take weeks to get you set up.
Also for most people they are too late to cash in.  The coin isn't going to go up by tenfold again and it's a risky investment.
@_date: 2014-08-15 23:41:02
Because it's deflationary you end up overpaying for everything.

@_date: 2014-02-16 06:49:03
The value of bitcoin is holding up because the exchanges have stopped trading them for fiat.

Yes it would but it would be a tiny percent so it would not matter. Financial Transaction Tax is a wonderful thing. Don't be afraid of it just because you have to pay less than 1% on your bitcoin purchases.

Nonsense. If the play store was taking it their network would dwarf bitcoin.


Sure it would.  It would play nice with google wallet and you could use it at the play store. 


Google has more servers than anybody else in the world.


They could start mining when the difficulty is low and build up a warchest easy.


None were backed by a major corporation.
@_date: 2015-02-03 08:42:25
It takes a few minutes to clone bitcoin. It might take a few days for Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, any government or bank to make their own crypto coin.
There is no rule that says bitcoin will survive the onslaught of a large corporation or bank backed digital coin. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 08:56:55


Google can easily mount a 51% attack on any digital currency. 


Since the google coin would use the same codebase this would also apply to it.


Again Google can do this now, it can get a million servers to start mining bitcoins and control the network.


For the third time.
Google (or microsoft, or amazon, or facebook etc) can easily marshall million servers to mine any currency they want.


No you fucking idiot. It will be worth money because there will be demand for it from people wanting to shop at the play store.


Listen retard. I don't know how many times I have to say thing but the google coin would be exactly the same codebase. It too would be decentralized.


It can be manipulated by any party who is able to mount a 51% attack.
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:26:41


Are you really this dense?  Where did you get the idea that I was making this point?


Google could own 51% of the bitcoin network tomorrow if it wants to.


yes they can. They have millions of servers at their disposal.


Or not. On the other hand any one of them could also conduct the same attack.


Because none of them share the same zealotry as you do. In the end bitcoin is just the current ponzi scheme. The early miners got all the wealth, everybody else is scrambling for the crumbs.  Sooner or later like all pyramid schemes it's going to collapse.
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:01:02


How do you know that?
Google can just clone bitcoin and call it google coin. It would be exactly the same but with the google name. They could have the play store accept it and voila! Everybody starts using google coing.
It would be completely decentralized and allow every person in every country to use it exactly like bitcoin because it would be the exact same code as bitcoin.
Of course they could mine it if they wanted to with their massive data centers just like they could mine bitcoin today.


It would be the exact same codebase. No controlling party.

@_date: 2013-04-12 06:25:52
Bitcoin is just one of at least dozen digital currencies. Most of them use same scarcity model but others have differing goals.
The barrier to entry to the other coins is insignificant so in a very real sense there is no scarcity at all. There are an infinite amount of virtual coins and anybody can start one today.
@_date: 2013-07-15 11:08:11


But it's better to spend inflationary currency on them. A dollar today is going to be worth less tomorrow. This means you should spend your dollars today. A bitcoin today is going to be worth more tomorrow. This means you should hold on to your bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-04-09 08:16:08
Let me iterate some reasons people might switch.
People have already missed out on the bitcoin pyramid so they will switch to other coins to get in the bottom.
The people who have invested in large gpu mining rigs can no longer use them with bitcoins so they will mine something else.
Bitcoin is rising so fast nobody is spending them, other coins which are more stable will be more useful for commerce.
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:31:48


For bitcoins. For other crypro coins it's still early so people will jump to them instead to get in on the bottom floor.

I don't think we'll see at all because I don't think it's a serious threat to anybody. Right now the people trying to control bitcoin are doing a fine job disrupting the system. The DDOS attacks on MtGox. The skype botnet (and other botnets), the guilds that control most mining and of course the rampant pump and dump.
This is not going to end well and I don't think the govt will have to lift a finger. Right now there are people with billions of USD worth of bitcoins.  When they cash out (and they will) it's going to be fun to watch.

Bitcoins are not supposed to be an investment. It's supposed to be currency.
The more it succeeds as investment the more it fails as currency.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:24:11
There is no shortage of people wanting to buy bitcoins or vendors wanting to get bitcoins for their wares. In fact one leads to the other. The demand for bitcoins drives the the price up which makes it more attractive to the vendors.
The only thing missing from this equation is the consumer who is willing to part with the BTC to buy goods.  Every day the consumer waits the coins are worth more money so there is no incentive to spend the coins.
If you want verification just take a look at the headlines of the front page of this reddit. All of them about the increasing value of BTC, none of them about doing actual commerce.

Here is a hard question for you.
What can bitcoin do that any other fork of bitcoin can't?
Let's say I am Visa. I fork bitcoins and make "VisaCoin" and I have the same transaction fees, mining rules etc. The only difference is that anybody in the world with a Visa Card can buy VisaCoins just by going to a web site and moving money from their Visa Card to VisaCoins. Of course you can also go the other way. Maybe Visa charges a small fee for this like $1.00 or a small percent slightly higher than the current bitcoin transaction fees.
Some of you will say "corporate controlled, centralized" etc but so what?  People already trust them with their money.
If not a corporation then what can bitcoin do that litecoin, feathercoin, novacoin and the other coins can't?  If Amazon decided to accept feathercoins tomorrow what would happen to bitcoins value? 
Let's face it digital currencies have massive advantages over fiat currencies but no digital currency has an inherent superiority over another. Not the current crop anyway, they are all basically bitcoin forks.
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:38:06
They can't afford bitcoins. Maybe lite coins or some other coin which is more reasonable in price.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:32:24
Why not use ripple? Isn't that what it's supposed to be for?
@_date: 2013-07-16 11:17:26


Exactly what I said. It makes no sense to spend bitcoins. The value only goes up.


A deflationary currency discourages spending.

It's supposed to be a currency.

Has anybody done research on whether they beat the market or breast random picks?
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:11:16
It's not really cheaper. Let me explain.
The seller is willing to give you a discount because he thinks the value of the bitcoin is going to go up.
You give up your bitcoin and lose out on the increased value. His gain is your loss.
As long as bitcoins go up in value this will happen. It's just speculation.  
Like it or not the primary purpose of most bitcoin purchases is for speculation purposes not for commerce.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:55:25
Bitcoin is not the only virtual currency. Competing currencies have the exact same usefulness. There is nothing especially unique about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:46:48

So the best case scenario is that Amy sold an item that was worth 10 dollars for five dollars.
The worst case scenario is now worse.
Amy sells the item.
She deposits ten dollars and loses interest on that for a while.
Jack deposits ten dollars for the item and then deposits five dollars into another account (why would he agree to do that?).
Jack doesn't release the password.
Amy doesn't get the ten dollars either way. The best case is that she gets five dollars for the item.
But if the five dollars is in a shared password account he could theoretically pull the money out too.
Finally there is no such thing as everyone loses. The escrow makes out like a bandit. They keep the money.

There are dozens of other digital coins that can do the exact same thing.
Furthermore a major player (Google, Facebook,  apple,  PayPal, banks etc) could introduce as coin tomorrow and it would get wider user base and acceptance in a week than bitcoin got in five years.
Digital currencies are a revolution but bitcoin has no special advantage other than being the first popular one. We all know that first movers almost never last.

Those are not fundamentals.  That's just the symptom of a bubble building. 
1. Most everybody who is buying bitcoins today is doing as an investment not as a trading currency. These people have no intention of spending those bitcoins. They are going to hold and then sell for another currency.
2. The reason bitcoins are so hard to get is because the early adopters (Who hold a vast majority of coins) are still holding on to them.
It's all speculation. There is no fundamental there.
