@_date: 2017-11-26 18:43:08
I guess I have to do your googling for you:  


Deflation is a contraction in the supply of circulated money within an economy, and therefore the opposite of inflation. In times of deflation, the purchasing power of currency and wages are higher than they otherwise would have been. This is distinct from but similar to price deflation, which is a general decrease in the price level, though the two terms are often mistaken for each other and used interchangeably.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:55:22

@_date: 2017-11-25 19:30:27
The term deflation is a specific economic term relating solely to the supply curve of money. It is often used interchangeably with what could be called "price deflation" which is just a general reduction of prices across an economy as a whole. What you're saying is correct, but it is a different (though very related) economic concept.

deflationary requires reducing the supply. inflationary requires an increasing supply (no matter how small or large). a static supply would be just that, a static supply. not sure what the word is for it since it's basically never existed.

@_date: 2017-11-25 19:11:06


I was just explaining what deflation and inflation are. Those terms, by definition, are changes to the supply curve of a currency. They say nothing about the demand curve. So in the case where you have an increasing supply, and increasing demand that "outpaces" supply, then you have a price increase (which is what I think you meant), but you still have inflation.  
I don't know whether Bitcoin is inflationary or deflationary right at this moment because there's no way to know how many coins are getting permanently lost, and if that number is more or less than the new coins created by mining.

The problem is that the incentives scale the opposite direction. The more the network is used, presumably the more valuable a bitcoin becomes, the more valuable bitcoin becomes, the more resources people will be willing to spend to mine bitcoin therefore the more energy is used.

an attack may or may not happen, that's always a risk, but not the one I'm worried about. I'm worried about the cost of maintaining the network when there are no attacks- so even in the best case scenario it's really expensive.

Inflationary currency works, fixed supply currency works better. The whole concept of inflation isn't really about the quantity of money going up, it's about who gets newly printed money first. If it was just about increasing the quantity of money, then inflation should be paid by the federal reserve like interest to people- equally to everyone. Instead, purchasing power is taken from some people to be given to others. Not only does it not work economically, it is immoral.

Yes. In the market for mining, production will tend towards marginal cost equaling marginal revenue equaling average total cost. The assumption I’m making is that the more use the network gets, the more valuable bitcoin is. If you object to that, my point still stands that the mining cost goes up the higher the price of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:42:55

From the stats I could find it looks like Google does not use as much energy as Bitcoin, maybe a factor of 10 less (5tWh compared to 50tWh), but the key point here is the amount of energy for a single transaction. For the same amount of energy, you could do a single transaction on the bitcoin network, or power a home for a month. Anyway, if to you this doesn't seem like something that has to be fixed, I guess that's your call.

@_date: 2019-01-06 23:48:48
it's expensive because of the incentives. the real resources spent on mining tend towards the mining reward, which as the price of bitcoin goes up, also goes up. it's lie a bath tub with the drain open, but the more water you pour in, the bigger the drain gets. it's problematic.

@_date: 2018-03-01 19:09:16
Gresham's law applies to any currency. All that matters is that some sort of authority forces people to accept the two currencies at a given exchange rate. The point of Gresham's law is that when the fixed exchange rate no longer represents what would be the market exchange rate for the two currencies, people spend the overvalued currency and keep the undervalued currency (since people have to accept them at the given exchange rate).
Think of it this way (I'm adding $ as a third currency reference point) Right now bitcoin is worth $10,000, and ETH is worth $1000. If the government stepped in and said people must accept both currencies at a fixed rate of 10:1, if bitcoin were to go up in value to $20,000, people would not spend their bitcoin, since they could spend 10 ETH instead. And people wouldn't price things in bitcoin either, or at least not their true price. If someone wanted to sell a car for $20,000 (the value of one bitcoin) they wouldn't advertise a price of 1BTC, since anyone could come in and pay them 10 ETH instead (only worth $10,000).

That may be true, but it doesn't really address the issue at hand. The incentive structure of proof of work means that the higher the price of bitcoin, the more energy will be used to secure the network.

This is the prevailing view in many economic circles. I think that mainstream macro is extremely misguided. I can tell you've thought carefully about these issues, so I encourage you to keep an open mind since it is by no means a unanimous view among distinguished economists. You may have seen this video, but I'll link anyway. I am on the Hayek side of this debate.
To your point about loaning money in a fixed money supply economy, this is actually a really interesting question. There appears to be a mathematical issue where how could interest continue to be paid out when the supply of money can't increase. One way to look at it is that this issue still exists even in an economy with a growing money supply, although it's hidden. When you loan money, you are really just loaning out purchasing power, and getting paid back with more purchasing power in the future. The reason you can believe you will get more purchasing power in the future is that the supply of goods and services being produced would go up if the loaned money is used to invest in productive capital goods. This fundamental concept doesn't change whether or not the money supply changes. It's a hard concept to articulate, especially in a reddit post, but it's certainly very worthy of discussion.

I would hate for you to think that the argument being made doesn't stand on it's own merits, but rather depends on the qualifications of an internet stranger. I would also point out that highly qualified people come to complete opposite positions on this issue, so qualifications on their own are not sufficient to come to any determinations on the validity either postion. That said, there is a quote that I think is useful in putting qualifications in to perspective: 


So, if you prefer to judge the idea based on my qualifications rather than its own merits, which I recommend against, I will tell you. I have an economics degree from a top 10 university where I studied under a Nobel laureate.

Well, your best bet is just to hire a CPA to help you come up with estimates, but generally speaking it's just paying taxes quarterly for taxable income that doesn't have automatic withholdings like a paycheck would. A CPA can help you come up with how much you should pay. Basically if you have taxable income, say a big capital gain, you owe taxes on it before the end of the year. You may have capital losses after the fact, and that will factor in to your tax refund. I don't know much about actually calculating it, just that there can be penalties if you don't pay enough over the course of the year. I don't think they are huge penalties.

There are a lot of issues with this way of looking at things. First, is individual liberty to make decisions about consumption. If you want to consume later rather than now, that's a personal choice. Second, if you look at the macro scale, if someone with a great deal of wealth in cash chooses not to spend it, that means that they are not putting upward pressure on prices for everyone else, which means everyone else's purchasing power is higher than it would be had they spent, meaning other people can consume more than they otherwise would have been able to. Saving does not cause economic collapses.

Money doesn't "circulate." It is from time to time exchanged, but at no point in time is it not "hodled" by somebody or "hoarded" if you prefer the negative connotation.

Maybe you'll still be able to buy back lower. Who knows?
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:44:03
At all times all money is "hoarded."

I'm worried about the alarming number of fiatsplainers this sub apparently has.

The fiat you deposit to coinbase is held by banks. Banks are the custodians. Coinbase is not legally a fiat bank, nor in theory a fiat bank.

It's similar in some respects, yes. If you meant "kind of like a bank" that's what you should have said, since coinbase is not a bank, and they don't hold people's fiat..

Why does that mean Bitcoin failed? It just means its use case isn't primarily point of sale payments.

Are you sure you meant this as a response to my post? If you confirm you did, I will respond to it in detail.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:04:09
I'm just pointing out that money is at all times held by somebody, so the concept of hoarding is silly.

That's what the people who disagree with him say. He disagrees with those people, and he's right. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

You asked for my qualifications and I gave you them. I could have listed a long list of economic literature that I have read and studied as well. I am not sure why you are arguing with me about this, I agree with you that "credentials" are not the deciding factor here but the argument itself. Why are you calling me uninformed? You have no clue..

Most bitcoin is owned by a handful of people. They are selling and will continue to indefinitely.
