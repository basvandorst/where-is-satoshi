Let's imagine a world where all other currencies have failed and only bitcoin exists.  Because right now people have trouble seeing bitcoin as a currency because it is wildly volatile in comparison to other currencies.  But remove those other currencies, and it is as stable, in fact more stable, than any currency in the world today because it cannot be traded for any other currency because they don't exist any longer.
Bitcoin is divisible currently to 8 decimal points.  A satoshi can be as low as 0.00000001.  What if 0.00000001 represents 1 dollar of buying power.  Remember, in this scenario there are no more dollars so I'm just using that as a point of reference.  Let's call them satoshis.  Now the math.  
If 0.00000001 = 1 satoshi
1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis
If there are 21 million bitcoins multiplied by 100,000,000 satoshis = 2,100,000,000,000,000 total "satoshi" supply
2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis divided by the number of people on earth 7.44 billion = 282,258 satoshi supply for each person
That's 2,100 trillion satoshis of money supply.  There are currently anywhere from 5 trillion to 80 trillion of total money supply today according to google.  So the satoshi could support a rapidly growing population for centuries to come.  
One day that dream MIGHT become a reality and if it is you'll think back to today and imagine how much you could have had if you just invested a few worthless dollars in the fixed money supply of the future.

I'm not sure I'd advise buying at all time high prices.  A good saying to remember is buy when others are selling and sell when others are buying.  So now would be a good time to sell. 
Consider dollar cost averaging which is just buying at a fixed time interval.  So maybe ever two weeks or once a month you buy bitcoin no matter what the price is.  If you buy at say $5,000 and $6,000 then your dollar cost average is ($5000 + $6000) / 2 = $5500.

Buy from exchange, ATM or wherever and copy your bitcoin address from wallet and paste it to the exchange or ATM when you withdrawal.

Great answer to the question why /s

The former.  You own it and control it when it's in your wallet (electrum)

Anyone wondering how the hospitals were able to acquire bitcoin so quickly?  Also I noticed all the transactions have confirmations so I'm surprised they didn't pay too low of a fee.  It's almost as if whoever was in charge of paying the ransoms has some knowledge already about bitcoins.  Most rookies pay too low a fee and have to wait a day or more for confirmations.  Seems odd to me.
