This is a smartass answer, but probably the right one. My 78 year old aunt's friend was talking about buying, as was my 54 year old business partner.

In talking with the proprietor of the ATM here in Albuquerque, they are different.
In NM we don't have our own set of MSB laws, Mass does, so that may be outside the law, and I'm not sure about the others.
NM's lack of separate MSB laws are why he set up here.

This is not even close to true. I work at a bank and people regularly get 10-20k cash. The times people order are for much larger amounts. That's because banks only keep x amount of cash at a given branch. If we have say 300k for the week we need to plan for someone to take a third of that. However they can go to a few branches to lessen the burden.

I agree, but bitcoin is more like a commodity or currency than an equity, and neither of those markets have those rules anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:28:42
I like the idea, and it seems to have sufficient traction.  But no, I'm not hook, line, and sinker.  I've traded stocks for 14 years myself on and off, never mind getting my first stocks when I was born and being over 30 now, and been FINRA licensed (series 7 &amp; 66) for almost 5.  I've known broke brokers, and broke traders and I can't say I'm super flush myself.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:29:16
I said the same thing earlier.  If someone took a big position to buy at say $100 it'd offer a great resistance point. I think liquidity would also be helped by a few market makers to help keep there from being just a trickle of buys/sells at various amounts.  The issues are more from lack of liquidity and volume than anything IMO.  It's just not a mature market, and, as we've seen, many of the issues come from exchanges that just aren't robust enough.
This is sorta why pink sheets / OTC trades are so much more volatile than NYSE issues.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:18:11
Those are from securities regulations and government intervention which would violate the spirit of bit coin.

Great post.  I have said it before, and I'll say it again, it's a liquidity thing (too).

$266 is only $5.6 billion USD (at 21mm bitcoin), take away the lost/destroyed/etc coin, nevermind adjusting for ever inflating USD, and you're at 1/5th of the GDP of Vermont, which is  on the list of US states. $266 sounds kinda low when you think of it like that.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:53:14
Its not a mature currency. With maturity come exchanges and more people accepting it. These are growing pains.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:55:55
It's ok for Joe Q. Public to be scared right now, it's healthy IMHO.  It needs to get some growing pains worked out while it has lower adoption, and grow that adoption with reference to what people can manage to deal with.  At the beginning the geeks were there to work out the tech issues, now we are in the phase where the financial types are interested, and infrastructure must grow.. but these are generally people that get that it's new, and are in it for the excitement, whereas the predecessors were in it for the concept.  Next will shift more and more to practicality and stability.  That's why we are seeing the exchanges getting more robust, and more vendors accepting it.
We aren't done with the exciting part, nor are we done with the technology emergence, the change of the tech is slowing a bit, and the infrastructure is growing to accommodate the excitement, and eventually the broader acceptance. 
It's the diffusion of innovation as a poster in another thread pointed out.  we are still in the early adopter phase, but ever moving on the line.
The book by everett rogers on the subject is great, it's the same with this as a basic example in the book of convincing a tribal villiage to boil water.  A few will try it out, then more and more until it becomes common.

While the theory is plausible there isn't enough liquidity for them to move $10mm or more 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:52:31
That made no sense.
HFT is just taking advantage of minute market changes, it allows for more to be exchanged at more even levels.  Having a standing bid, especially if it's large adds resistance.  Resistance to moving outside of a span adds stability, and that is a good thing (for the masses).  Waiting in line to buy at $50 is what keeps it from skyrocketing, which is as unhealthy as crashing.
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:00:42
Painting the tape is the proper term.  Say you and I trade amongst ourselves at lower and lower dollar amounts to make it appear that prices are crashing so we can buy at an artificially lower price.

If you have a sitting order to Sell 10000BTC at $175USD, and one to buy 10000 BTC at $125USD the market won't soon break from either the top or bottom of that span.  It's both a top and a bottom that would supply stability.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:02:36
What a stupid comment. Because of the lack of governance you can't bar them.  Besides, if I operated the exchange would I rather have 100 people trading 1x per day at getting 1%, or 100 people trading 100x per day and making .1% each?  Let the markets work it out for themselves, that's the point of an unregulated currency and market.
If the exchange can't handle the HFT let each one decide how to deal with it.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:48:10
agreed, I also think shorting is healthy.

Was there more volitility at the start?  Abso-friggen-lutely, are these hand picked examples, yup, but is this sufficient to show not all meteoric rises are bubbles?  I'd say so.
Further, leverage isn't really a thing, nor are options, I realize they weren't for south seas trading, or tulip mania, and I'm not even saying it's different this time.  I'm just saying we don't know yet.  An abundance of caution is always wise, but the future isn't written yet.

It's still a loss, just not a realized loss.  Don't peddle this garbage.  If I buy BTC at 100 and it falls to 90 I still lost.  I lost ability to use the btc for $100, or the $100 I could get in USD, I just didn't lock that loss in.
Locking a loss in to then use the money for something else can be smart if the other use provides you greater value (LTC, Paying bills, etc)

Wall street is a nebulous term really.  You have a huge breadth of actors.  Individual advisors, firms, institutional advisors, bond traders, forex traders, market makers, etc.  I'd bet a shit ton more quants know of it, than floor traders, and institutional forex analysts are probably somewhere near the middle.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:30:46
I would feel more comfortable knowing how much downside needs to be absorbed by that huge bid wall
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:40:51
The Other point I'd like to make is that it is not a mature currency.  Though rising, only a handfull of businesses and individuals accept BTC as a form of payment, and the exchanges are all new and haven't been stress tested.  This is a stress test, these are growing pains, these are exacerbated by not having a government to intervene and prop it up, but that is also the point of it all.  Laissez faire will sort this out over time.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:08:01
I don't get how it'd work in practicality.
How would it make money for the supplier of the infrastructure
Would it just be a wallet on a card?
What happens if it's lost?
Can it be reloaded?
Can it be tied to multiple wallets?
Just saying a debit card for bit coin doesn't give nearly enough info for me to think if I would use it.

1. The Stability thing is a stupid argument.  It's fledgling currency with a rapidly growing base, new anything has instability. 
2. It is deflationary to a point, but history has no examples I'm aware of with mild predictable deflation, whereas it has many of wild inflation ruining everything. (zimbabwe, germany, etc)
3. Regulation will save us... no.  That's more of a fundamental argument which has been beat to death.
4. Is it a pump and dump? Maybe.  But it could also be the earliest adopters taking profits after a run up from a great deal of press.

Banks do bank Monetary Services Businesses (MSBs) but have to do very frequent check ups, and need to keep greater records on them.  Many won't even open new accounts for MSBs, and if they show too great a risk they will shut down their banking relationships.  
Also, the recent FiCen notice classified trading platforms of virtual currency as MSBs and made it harder for them.
