I have been a coinbase user for many years. Just recently, I have only been able to purchase $100 a day, whereas I used to be able to purchase at least $1000.
On your verifications page it wants me to re-verify. But I did this year's ago and nothing has changed with me. 
How secure is my private data used for AML/KYC at coinbase?
Also, why did it take your support 10 days to give me a generic answer to my problem? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:33:20
Umm. After finex I really hope this doesn't happen soon.
Even though I have been trying to use CB and getting a 100$ limit even though my daily buy sell limits is 10k $ .
Wtf coinbase?

Seriously, we shouldn't try to get it unbanned or counteract any lobbyists here in USA, we should try to get bitcoin pushed forward in competing countries, so we HAVE to keep up or be left behind this new innovation. We have the upper hand now, we can either play by the old rules or write the new rules!
@_date: 2014-05-30 07:52:39
Right! So we have an 'info wallets that we keep some spending coins in and that transmits the data along with the transaction straight from scanning the QR code. 
[Leans back] freaking genius!
@_date: 2014-05-30 08:51:19
So, maybe at first its just magazine ads and internet ads. It will find a way to overcome this. Like the QR codes that made up images that was a hit in this sub a few months ago.

I too own a travel agency that books high end vacation rentals in Hawaii. I am the first agency in Hawaii that will accept bitcoin. 
The reason I love it is due to charge backs. I agree the fees with Paypal or wire transfer are way too high, but what happens with me is that a customer doesn't get enough towels or finds a bug on a $2000/night rental and they dispute the whole charge of $15,000. 
So, then I have to fight them, and also the owner of the rental, as their money gets caught up waiting for the banks to make up their minds. Sometimes this costs me an account with a rental which means less money for me. Also, I have had to eat an entire booking before, which really sucks. 
With bitcoin, I can offer a better discount, and if something goes wrong, I have complete control over who gets money back. It saves my ass. I just wish I could have all of my customers pay with bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-10 17:20:00
In my industry they are not defenseless. We rely heavily on good reviews on places like tripadvisor, or yelp, etc.  reputation makes it worth keeping customers happy. I always work with customer complaints to find a resolve. It just sucks when PayPal tells me how to run my business.  
@_date: 2014-05-30 08:48:37
I just tweeted this idea to Mark Andreesson and coinbase. This needs to happen IMHO

I am moving to Silicon valley in a month from now and trying to get into a bitcoin startup. I have 15 years marketing and business development experience. Any tips or recommendations of start ups that I should try to get in with?

I did the same. Its like washing your car, it always makes it rain afterwards.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:28:40
I think you missed my point. I will rent a 3 million dollar house for a week for $15k. They find a cockroach at some point which is common in Hawaii, and they want money back, but instead of asking me, they dispute the charge and I get shafted on the entire $15k. Then I have to explain to the owner why the don't get paid their 13k and they get pissed. If I have enough bookings in the future with that rental, then I have to cater to that owner. That means instead of me making 2k on a good booking, I lose 13k of my own money. It's a quick way to go out of business. With bitcoin, the customer has to contact me, and I can offer maybe $500 back. Instead of losing my ass, while some family got a free stay in a multimillion dollar home.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:21:37

I am staying in a hotel I booked with BTC through Expedia. I also just booked another hotel for tonight with Expedia on the other side of town.
Here is the kicker, I used to work in direct competition to Expedia, in a smaller niche market that they were bullying their way into, so I had to go head to head with them in bidding wars for contracts worth millions of dollars. I took some of them, but it was very David VS Goliath, so I always held a grudge against them. But, now they made it so easy to travel with BTC, I am now a customer. And actually they do a damn fine job together with coinbase.

Good points. I am not that upset about it. I just left thinking wtf just happened. It was totally unexpected. But you nailed it. I was calm and collected and had witty responses. He fealt threatened because he wanted to be right and clearly was not. I think I will just not recommend people accept bitcoin and maybe just talk about how I use bitcoin.

Of course, but if $50 billion was spent in a year on drugs, it is highly likely that there would be a much higher market cap.

He is an ex cop that thinks he knows everything. Thats why he reacted so harshly. He fealt inferior in his facts but strong in his opinion, so he lost his temper instead of actually considering something new. I have seen many older men like this. They get stuck in one way of thinking and no amount of logic can change that.
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:58:15
That would mean a market cap of around $50 billion. Would it not?
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:14:23
Yes. Actually in past discussions about investing I have had with him it became quite clear that he has no idea of intrinsic value. All value to him is in dollars. He takes no consideration the value of said dollars.

When you are bartending you are pretty much free to do as you wish as far as subjects to talk about unless they are offensive or bad for business. None of that is the case. He was just upset because he was wrong.

I'm pretty sure he has never owned any coin. He probably just read a headline of some Fox news article or something.
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:52:45
They would have to be moved and converted in and out of cash much faster then they are currently. If $50 billion was used for drugs in a year I would guess the market cap would be somewhere around $20 billion conservatively.
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:52:17
You are very right. I have spoken to the guy that owns 2 hotels before about it and he wants to do it. I wasn't trying to convert my boss, I just was correcting his flawed info. He took that personally. You are right though, the right minds will naturally gravitate to bitcoin.

While I think you have a great point, I also think that this quote gives me the feeling they will be using the "bitcoin  / network" for more than the boring logging data on the blockchain...






Ok, seems like a cool use of blockchain... right? Ohh, wait?...


Which we all probably agree Bitcoin is better at...
Maybe I have rose colored glasses on, but Me Thinks they wouldn't be smart enough to develop this much effort on the blockchain if they didn't have some future use for much more projects in alpha and soon beta on the blockchain.
I think they will all realize soon enough that they cannot compete with the power and security as the bitcoin network.
TL:DR; Soon, Visa will find a way for you to pay them for all the benefits of the Bitcoin you know and love.

Simple. I couldn't deposit any cash into her local bank. I sold someone from her area bitcoins for them to deposit cash into her local bank. I had cash that I tried to send, but it couldn't get there in time. Bitcoins made it fast and cheap. And she didn't have to meet any strangers to sell bitcoins in person.

Actually I couldn't. I have cash, and money in my bank, and bitcoins. Her bank is in another country. I can't deposit funds into her bank. I sold bitcoins to someone in her area, so they deposited the money straight into her bank. It was very simple and fast. But my first guess was to do like you suggested. It just didnt work, and WU didn't let me send money for absolutely NO fucking reason.
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:09:53

 I just hope we don't have to wait 138 years to get the attention it deserves now.
@_date: 2013-09-24 04:11:47
The point maybe I left out is that her bank and my bank are a 6 hour plane ride away. I cannot deposit into her account from here. Bank wires take at least 24 hours, and involve paying fees and me physically going to my bank. By selling to someone on local bitcoins and having them deposit cash into her bank, the process happened, and I am my GFs hero once again. Nothing about savings. It's about rapid transfer of value.

Yes, I sold BTC to them on Saturday, and was supposed to receive payment today but have not.

I'm glad you liked my story. Technically Fiat did save my GF today. But there would have been no way to get money into her hands if I didn't sell Bitcoins. 
So, bitcoin ushered the process, and made it much cheaper of a transaction. I wouldn't send my GF to meet a stranger to sell bitcoins. She wouldn't know where to start. 
I had no other method of moving money to her hands immediately. WU was a bust, PayPal takes forever, I couldn't go to my bank to sign the papers and pay the fees for a wire.  Which takes another day to process. We don't use the same bank.
She was traveling and someone stole her purse. Luckily she still had her ID, and that was it. 
Bitcoin allowed her to survive today. Not WU.

You need a show like Dexter. 
Basically, Satoshi Nakamoto is a serial killer that chases down people who deal on the silk road. 
He implemented a tracking algo into the mining hash, that he can track users and hack into all sites that accept bitcoin as payment. 
He then finds them, after car chases and private jets with cocaine and hookers, he ends up putting them into a remote private island to work as slaves doing manual hashing for one of the alt coins. That is until the Dread Pirate Roberts befriends him and turns the tables on the FBI.
