Which startup is it
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:05:33
The twins might be accumulating some coins for their etf.  They probably already got investors lined up.  If i were them i would want to keep my personal coins and source some more for the fund
@_date: 2017-02-17 22:01:05
nothing.  seriously just bought bitcoin and sent to one friend. and then he sent some back.  If you read their new terms of service now it basically bans literally everything including using it to pay "debt service".  what an useless app.  
@_date: 2017-02-14 07:32:57
So boring stuck @ 1k
@_date: 2017-02-14 06:31:15
i keep about 40% cash 60% btc.  mostly because it takes a while to withdraw fiat and i can't pay everything in btc yet.. fiat money is just sloooooow.  it's not a huge amount of overall portfolio though.

BUY MORE BITCOIN
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:11:14
They actually could do it over the counter too and sell to other rich folks.  A lot of people want to buy millions of dollars worth.

I think its op here

people on localbitcoins sometimes sell their profiles.  
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:49:16
Just look on craigslist. There are people that sell gold/cars in btc.  There are quite a few gold dealers that accept btc.  One i have visited in sf.  
I have also heard a radio ad from a local car dealership that said they accept btc.  You can buy houses, too.  Just look up the story about the guy in socal that bought a house and got a free ferrari.  Just find people who are willing to trade for btc instead of fiat.  i have convinced just random people to accept btc for their stuff
@_date: 2017-02-14 07:40:03
Sooooo. Ur saying bitcoin is hedge against everything.  Got it.  Buy more bitcoin

30 is too old.  I'd just do 18.  
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:27:14
it's a good price actually. it's sold directly by ledger so i think it's safe. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:42:59
and also because they made these laws that default people into 401ks even if you don't sign up.  don't get me wrong.... i do have a 401k and contribute, because of savings on taxes, but i don't like the stock market as much as bitcoin.

Nope.  Satoshi is not a family name.  Japanese and chinese people have a small set of family names and more creative first names.  Satoshi is the japanese name of ash ketchum coincidentally.  So maybe bitcoin's creator just really liked pokemon.

I think he is alive and he has no need to touch the money.  With his technical skills he could be already paid very well.  Anonymity is quite priceless in this situation.  IF people knew who he was he could be arrested for enabling Silk Road and any number of other illegal activity.  He could be many governments' enemy, and i think that is why he is laying low and just watching

@_date: 2017-03-17 08:29:14
Maybe because you can't buy real goods with most other coins.  You have to trade Back into btc to spend 90% of those coins

allll time highhhhhhhssss
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:43:50
Having other coins is not a bad thing.  All the alts are mostly traded in term of btc so in the end most of the value is still in btc.  It's like how in fiat the USD runs most of the world, but we do have JPY/EUR/GBP/CNY
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:23:22
I just buy a couple hundred dollars worth weekly.  It's like a savings acct for me.  I also spend some on purse.io, but lately i'm spending less &amp; less for my usual expenses like groceries &amp; restaurants.  That means it's working as intended.  so i'm not a complete hodler, but i'm spending less than i hodl cuz btc went up and also cuz purse.io gives u a buffer with the discount.  
@_date: 2017-01-09 06:04:33
Any bank could buy a ton of coins right now.  15 billion is really nothing to any one of them.  i think they want to see where it goes and what they can use
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:43:43
Yea,  you can be a bitcoin earner on that.  Take the amazon orders that only cost 5 to 10%.  U can get amazon giftcards with cash in many places
@_date: 2017-01-15 08:20:01
What R the fees for debit on gemini?  I signed up half way last time and then didnt verify a bunch of stuff.  Wondering if its easier now

If you have amazon in your country try purse.io.  It can be as low as 5 to 10%

There is already btc lending

I do hope that it gets approved so i can buy some easily in an IRA.  I dont think they are stupid enough to buy it all at once.  They are probably accumulating now and also buying over otc

hmm..i'm interested but just don't know if that clearexchange thing can be reversed.  
@_date: 2017-01-12 05:32:12
it's okay they only bought small amounts.  they can afford to lose it.

None of these people's names show up on   Instead, there is an old spotted asian dude named Ed Moy and a whole page devoted to him.  REALLY BIZARRE website choice.

@_date: 2017-01-06 22:23:46
I think it should be @ 830 to 850 cuz it's been steadily going up at that rate in a straight line.  latest erection in the charts was a bit too much.  now that viagra wore off a bit.  I will pick up some @ the low 800s
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:16:34
as long as you dont do anything that makes the chinese government look bad it is mostly ok.  The american internet companies don't get how important "face" is to the chinese government so they do stupid stuff like mentioning human rights and free speech, and they get driven out.  The whole "don't mention devaluation" thing is part of the whole "face" thing.  Fortunately chinese exchanges and miners understand this and they will obey these completely reasonable demands and thrive.  
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:33:33
sell the bitcoin with an OTC trader.  get money.. buy house.  they might question the source of ur money though.  
@_date: 2017-01-17 08:53:51
What do you consider "not in tech sphere"?  Nearly every company uses the internet to sell stuff now.  Is overstock.com a tech company or just a store that sells stuff online?  Is expedia a tech company or a regular travel agency that sells a lot online?

@_date: 2017-01-22 17:18:13
This sounds amazing.  Would love to see your farm.  Total dream of mine to live off the grid.  Right now one of the few things i can't buy directly with btc  is gas and electricity.
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:13:23
Well i only started buying in august last year.  It was actually really stable for months and months.  I think it's back to being stable now, but it sure is fun

Well.  Coinbase's slowass funding made me miss the whole peak hahhaa.  So at least i got my coins at a good-ish price.  Silver linings i guess
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:52:19
cool thanks.  a little bit of a hassle.  i will look into it when I buy next time.  
@_date: 2017-01-27 01:46:33
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:51:14
they really don't care about btc that much right now cuz it's still too small for them to care. 15 billion dollars is NOTHING to the chinese government.  They basically have bigger fish to fry.   plus, those exchanges &amp; miners are getting big and are probably bribing people left &amp; right to not care.  
@_date: 2017-01-17 05:35:36

Brah,  its the weekend. Volume is usually lower
@_date: 2017-01-12 05:34:57
yeah you definitely need to sell that OTC.  you'd get screwed by slippage on exchanges, plus money transfer limits.  
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:28:08
they're chinese.. they know what's up
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:44:27
You will be fine.  Just use purse.io to buy stuff on amazon.  With 30% off u got a bit of a buffer.  I plan to put my savings this year in btc too

@_date: 2017-01-04 08:50:07
china just made this new rule:   my chinese coworkers told me about it since they are newlyweds and got gifts from their parents to buy a house in america, but they had to fill out forms like this and had issues moving money out.  they and their friends are all interested in using btc to move money out.  these are not technically "wealthy" people.  Mostly they are middle income parents that saved up a bunch of cash for their only children who are living overseas.  A lot of the younger chinese are very tech savvy as well and are taught from birth to distrust the government but they value money and investments.  It's a very different culture because they distrust their government.  Real estate in china is technically on a 80 year "lease", so you could get ur property confiscated.  that's why a lot of them buy real estate overseas, because they trust america and canada's property laws more.  
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:09:39

It doesn't really need "mass" adoption.  Only a small percentage of the world actually own any stocks or precious metals.  You just need a small percentage of the world to adopt it as an investment for it to go much higher

@_date: 2017-01-18 01:14:08
don't assume people on the internet are bros, bro.  Why is a director of making fiat coins good for a bitcoin company?  Just because he made real metal coins?  I am sure there is a joke in there somewhere.  Lots of people judge websites by how the website looks, and i guarantee you 99.999% of people have no clue who ed moy is.  not really effective marketing
