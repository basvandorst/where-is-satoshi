Technically, don't you lose money even if you take out your initial investment because of short-term tax? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:56:36
Are you me? That's pretty much my numbers.

When they say BTC transaction costs are high, what do they mean? Converting BTC to dollar on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:57:26
No. Depositing from GDAX doesn't lock in the price. Only Coinbase. But you pay fees. Still better than waiting for money to arrive. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:48:21
so 0?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:47:27
Can you elaborate on why it matters? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:22
Very true. I was trying to dollar cost average, but the market is moving so fast that ended up investing lump sum.

RemindMe! 7 days "Bitcoin plummets or passes 20k"

Something is better than nothing. You are doing great!      
You bought with money that you can afford to lose.      
You did not wait on the sidelines like everyone else calling it a bubble every time it hit a new high.        
     
I have so many friends that CAN afford to easily put 5k in BTC (without it affecting them if it even goes to $0) but they got paralyzed and kept waiting for BTC to dip. Most of them are still waiting.

How much? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:51:18
How many thousands have you already put in?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:55:41
How much did you put? mid 4 figures for me
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:29:15
How much do you buy each week?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:58:29
No. If BTC gains LTC gains. The reverse, not so much. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:32:39
The same thing that would have happened if your Uncle was your Aunt. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:56:31
How much did you put?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:12
What's POST-ONLY? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:18:06
You can easily do it through GDAX (also owned by Coinbase, so use the same account). It's pretty straightforward, instant and free. Let me know if you need any help.

Time in the market is better than Timing the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:47:53
Are you buying more? Have you already made up your initial investment?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:45:18
They have been largely flat when BTC  has been growing.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:23:56
Do you use coinbase on a weekly basis? How much do you feel comfortable investing usind DCA? I'm trying to do a couple hundred every week but am wondering if that's kind of too slow in cryptoworld considering how fast the growth(or decline) can be. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:51:12
Thanks. I completely understand. Do you set stop losses to lock in your gains or prevent losses? Let's say Bitcoin goes to $5k in a month. Wouldn't a stop loss help you keep your gains?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:53:45
Already did that. Moved all my cash from LTC, ETH to BTC yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:42:37
That's excellent advice. May I ask how much have you invested? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:43
Inaction is the biggest failure. Everybody has been saying that bitcoin is a bubble and about to crash since it was $1k. That doesn't mean bitcoin won't get below $10k tomorrow. However, if it ends up being 25k you missed out. If you are worried about losses, why not set your exit point before you enter the trade? May be set a stop loss at $12k and exit. Worse case you lose some. Best case: you gain and double or triple your money with this bull run. 
     
Does that make sense? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:32:25
Can you do that multiple times? Keep buying and selling within a month or can you only do it once? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:25:31
Thanks. Have you gotten your 1 Bitcoin yet?
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:41:27
How do you deal with taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:50:47
What lesson did you learn? Not to set stop loss limit order?
