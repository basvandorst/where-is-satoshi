Wow. Powerful, I think. Someday someone from the crowd might be up there talking about Bitcoin.

I feel like I am gambling! This is so addicting!!
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:37:13
Ahh count yourself as lucky! I wish my funds had taken an extra day to arrive. I got a lot in yesterday and bought and then value went poof today. Im wishing I had waited a day.
Then on that logic I could wait forever though....

We should pressure [Kiva] ( to start accepting BTC.
From the article:

A store of value is literally what a currency is.
"Currencies in this definition need not be physical objects, but as stores of value are subject to trading between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies."

They dont exist. (Yet?)

Ahh you should be good to start. If DiabloMiner doesn't start you may need to change the work size to 64 by appending `-w 64` to the end of the java command that starts the process. You can find this file by right clicking on the icon -&gt; Show Package Contents -&gt; Contents -&gt; MacOS -&gt; DiabloMiner-exe
You will find it at the very bottom of that file (open in Textedit or something similar).

Things like what happened today stop happening...
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:21:15
I bet we are dealing with more money than right now...
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:05:50
I suppose I am in denial right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:11:22
That is the best real time graph as far as I know... 
Blockchain has some interesting graphs on some different things if you want to check those out:
@_date: 2013-06-12 04:43:28
Perhaps it is only for verified users?
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:27:48
Yes... 
What version are you on... Snow leopard or Lion?
To get you started...
Here is a CPU miner:
And a GPU miner:
Any more questions? Are you familiar with pools?

You didn't get the "Mtgox trading engine lag: 2041.16s" on the top picture...
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:10:15
I'd like to see you run Mt. Gox....
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:56:14
Are you asking a question or making a statement?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:40:22
Im not panicing I am more just pissed that I bought for the first time last night at the high and dont have funds left to buy more now :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:34:34
I think this video does a pretty good job explaining the big ideas.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:43:44
May I also point out that  has "connected users: 11035" 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:15:45
Mine took around 36 hours. I was pleased as the website says up to five business days.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:29:56
Congratulations! Have fun :D
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:17:54
You are not alone. I did basically the same with 1000 USD. Yay Im hanging onto my 4 BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:35:47
BTCE and Bitstamp both fell to 75 and a little below 75 respectively. Everything is too unpredictable right now.

Where did you get $50k+ per day?? Where is 5 trades per second coming from?? I am suspicious you are pulling numbers out of the air.
Also this a decentralized currency. It is free for all. It is heavily influenced by computers and computer trading. Limiting the things you mentioned would likely make many users switch exchanges which is not what Mt. Gox wants.
PR... They do some PR. It could use some work in terms of professionalism. I think they have higher priorities than PR though, especially during these "events". I have no idea how they can warn before the fact about a DDoS or market crash if those are the kinds of events you are talking about. 
Also you might be interested in this document :
I would encourage you to read that before you put up any more numbers. And remember that is from August 2012. 
Operating cost per month: 3,500,000 Yen (~35000 USD) 
Revenue(over 7 month period): 380,450 USD, 58,400 BTC (Not sure if revenue is USD in the form of BTC or USD + BTC)
Anyway. This was August last year. They had two servers. During the downtime April 11 2013 (today for some, yesterday for most) they added another server. Not sure how many they added between last August and today, but I wouldn't be surprised if they have more than three now. 
If you are unsatisfied with their service, you are welcome to move your trading to another exchange.

I could be very wrong but I wouldn't expect it to have much of a delay if any. Banks conducting international wire transfers are independent of Mt. Gox and should not be influenced. There may be a slight delay with processing funds into your account on Mt. Gox's side though... thats it though.
