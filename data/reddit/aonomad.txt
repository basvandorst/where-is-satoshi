Can anyone recommend a good speakeasy?

Wow, all the people there are pretty ignorant. :/

Ditto. :| Gonna e-mail audenx and ask if she's heard anything.
@_date: 2013-04-28 04:04:09
Yeah, heard about that. I almost never take it alone though, I use it purely to pull all-nighters when I have a lot of writing to do, so I end up combining it with heavy doses of caffeine.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:35:50
If it makes you feel better that's something around 90% of my btc. :p
@_date: 2013-08-31 00:04:32
She e-mailed back saying she's had a large volume of people in our situation and would investigate.
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:35:15
My funds still show up, not sure if that's a good or bad thing. :/ Support hasn't even e-mailed me back (sent 6 days ago).
@_date: 2013-05-01 08:25:49
Sad but probably true. As a student it's pretty crushing, I used them for most of my bitcoin trading since it was (to me) one of the easiest and fastest exchanges to use. Had a lot of money there. :/
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:06:51
Ah no, did not know. Just read the above comments, though. :(
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:43:49
Six months ago I would walk across the street, deposit cash into bitfloor's account and walk out with bitcoins in my e-pocket not 5 minutes later. As most of you probably know, Bitfloor shut down in rather ungraceful fashion.
Is there any good option to buy bitcoins within an hour or two? I have cash in hand, I just don't know what exchange to use. Coinbase has always been my backup, but waiting a week for the btc leaves them illiquid for way too long for me to be comfortable.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:34:55
But they're always sold out. :( Kind of a bummer to pay the market price of 3-4 days later.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:37:45
Used them today for the first time, even though the price per BTC seems to be a bit higher than on other sites, they charge less in fees and I was able to get my bitcoins before I even left the bank.
@_date: 2013-04-29 13:19:37
I think you're confusing me for OP. :p
@_date: 2013-05-01 08:24:05
@_date: 2013-07-13 19:04:28
Before they shut down, they said review took 2-3 days. I expect it's much longer now because of the high volume they're probably receiving, but nevertheless mildly annoying.
@_date: 2013-05-10 19:42:36
I saved your comment knowing it would be useful at some point. ;) Unfortunately I've run into a bit of an issue (already e-mailed Virwox support but something tells me they won't be replying anytime soon).
You'll have to pardon my unfamiliarity with Second Life, I think my problem is probably common knowledge to other people but I can't seem to find in any FAQ or support posting online. I've successfully tied my SL account to my Virwox one, and went in-game to one of the terminals to transfer my Linden Dollars to my Virwox account. I verified the terminal and everything worked fine, but when I paid the L$ to the terminal, it gave them back to me, saying "We are sorry, but currently we do not accept SLL deposits." I tried this at several terminals, and all yielded the same result. Did I perhaps miss a step, or forget something important? This is my first time transferring L$ to my Virwox account, so not sure what I'm doing wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:19:57
Well we just hit $224 and $228 is not outside the realm of possibility if some largish orders come through again in the next half an hour
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:12:17
Honestly this is pretty great; sure the .1 BTC is rather pricey, but the full 1 BTC voucher is much more reasonable. I look forward to using this service in the future.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:24:55
I bought $1500 yesterday with no issues. Didn't know about this, wouldn't have done it if I had. :x
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:16:10
Yup, you were at -2 when I posted, totally undeserved but it's not a sector of the internet many people even realize exists let alone use it, so just raising awareness.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:03:36
Yesterday there were some absolutely massive trades, I have the pics saved at home I'll post them later. There were quite a few 2900 BTC and 8000 BTC purchases, crazy.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:23:21
I used bitinstant yesterday, the appeal is that it's faster (i.e. if you don't already have money in Mtgox it'll take a few days to fund your account, and by that time price is higher).
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, I'm new to all this.
@_date: 2013-06-22 00:28:21
I don't suppose you know a way to get them semi-quickly? Currently middlemanning for an Australian whose paypal isn't working for some odd reason.

Sign me up for the website link too. :)

Not gonna lie, little bit worried.

So how's your exchange coming BlacksmithTM?
@_date: 2013-05-02 08:14:19
As one of your customers who has an uncomfortable percentage of my student net worth locked in my account with your website, just wanted to tune in and say I GREATLY appreciate your posting here. Sure your lawyer may be saying not to talk to anyone, but honestly anything is better than nothing, utter silence makes everyone uneasy. Must be stressful to be going through this for you, we're thankful that you're still with us.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:44:59
It listed $500 as the maximum for me, so just did three of those (but with slightly different amounts otherwise they don't let you send them one after the other).
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:33:21
Brilliant website, look forward to using it in the future. =)

Any word on yours yet by chance?

I got mine before I left the bank, and bought BTC within a few steps after having left.

I've never done this before so just giving it a try, how does it work?

I'm in the same category as lijji, so I'll go ahead and email/tweet as well.
Thank you for your tireless and comprehensive assistance over the course of the past few months.

my situation:
4/17 Bank of America deposit sent (via LocalTill)
4/17 (hours later...) news about bitfloor released
4/17 (immediately thereafter) give my info to enable ACH/direct deposit
4/30 still not approved for ACH and still not approved :(

Correct, the Hidden Wiki is a legal site.

@_date: 2013-05-01 07:59:30
I was dumb and made limit orders instead of buying at market price. :'(
The coins I had with them I was able to transfer out within a few hours.

I saw $78 before the site crashed. Didn't even have time to open an account. :(

Oh brilliant. I'm not too concerned about it being anonymous, so I'll do that. Many thanks for the help!
@_date: 2013-09-12 00:05:51
With regards to the root of the issue, you're completely right. However, after the initial damage was done by the bank that closed their account, Bitfloor as a company and Roman as an entrepreneur did an absolutely horrendous job as far as organizing and managing the response goes. If it hadn't been for I am reasonably certain no one would have been refunded.
(I'm still waiting for my refund, so maybe a little biased--but that's my opinion.)
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:27:27
No, the bot sent me instructions to set it up though, so all is good.
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:52:16
Already tweeted bitfloor, I'll send one to Roman too, thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:12:38
I dunno, sounds like you're desperately grasping at straws.
