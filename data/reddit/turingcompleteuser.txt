If the FED keeps destroying the dollar then Bitcoin will go to the moon.

If naked short selling  will be done, then bitcoin will never go to the moon! So let's try to avoid it.

If this guy think that it is necessary then he should do it. He doesn't need a permition. Otherwise he is wasting our time.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:33:17
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:52:47
Do someone know a reliable alternative besides cryptsy? is bter good?
@_date: 2014-05-08 16:01:33
And the site is gone!
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:33:24
Are you better than coinbase?
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:43:49
The question is if it works in a brick and mortar-scenario. There you haven't got much time to send the second transaction after you pay your stuff.

Go for it! If you use USD/uB, then it looks like the price will go down over the time and that the legacy Dollar loose value. lol.

Viel Erfolg. Wird Zeit, dass sich in Deutschland einige gute Bitcoin-Startups ansiedeln. Go for it!

I would use a wallet where you have the control of your private keys unless you would like to convert BTC immediately to USD. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:28:44
This is a reason for governments to bann bitcoin :D
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:02:57
Is it usefull to to decrease the blocktime to 6 seconds (=1/100). So you could handle 700 tx/s. Or is this too unsecure?
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:39:30
I think MasterCard won't allow it in the long term.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:28:42
It has no intrinsic value! It's like a Ponzi!

bitpay seems much superior to coinbase for me. why does coinbase has more merchants than bitpay altough coinbase operates only in us? bitpay also does much more open source stuff...
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:31:41
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) likes him.
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:35:22
Don't forget to pay your taxes :D. The government has now money again.
@_date: 2014-04-23 13:32:36
How much transactions per second can POS handle?
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:20:55
Bitcoin CEO?
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:53:45
I've heard for this problem exist solutions like mixing services. Poor Americans.
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:59:37
It's hard to believe that socialists take precisious currencies. btw. don't read this bullshit papper.
@_date: 2014-08-05 20:36:31
tell us the price of btc in 2026 according to your model
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:13:16
But you can still withdram coins without this nazi-style questioning, right?
@_date: 2014-03-23 07:34:00
I have listened to an interview from word crypto network with open transactions. If you combine Bitcoin with open transactions, then you can handle thousands of transactions per second woth a confirmation time of less then a second. So I wouldn't worry too much. The free market will always find a solution, if it is allowed to.
@_date: 2014-03-19 08:49:08
I would gues the government mob don't like competition or am I wrong here?

"He is someone with a penchant for collecting model trains and a career shrouded in secrecy, having done classified work for major corporations and the U.S. military."
U.S. military and classified work sounds like inside job. Maybe Bitcoin was indeed created by the NSA etc. What's your thougths guys and girls?
@_date: 2014-08-05 20:57:30
