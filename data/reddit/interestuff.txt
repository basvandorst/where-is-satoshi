I think it tolerated drugs, just not violence, no?

Are you absolutely sure? Everything I've read about it from the community that used it said that it was pretty strict about that. And he was never charged with any hitman stuff, or else he would deserve the sentence sure.

Life without parole for operating this "criminal enterprise" while terrorists get less? It was the state sending a message to those who advocate internet freedom and bitcoin etc.
Also its American/Arab I think, or maybe just Arab with American writers (like most Middle East news sites tbh). I dunno - I guess it's odd that there is an SR article on it with no Arab connection really. I just like some of their writing.

I get what you're saying, trust me.
But I also see SR as a way of circumventing the dangers of buying from the street. Until there is decriminalization or legalization, it was a good option for people who wanted drugs. And they wanted it, so they were going to get it either way. this was a safer option.
Second thing - drugs do have an impact yes! absolutely! but so does alcohol, cigarettes, or any other vice. Banning them and lockinig people up for life who use or deal in them will never work, and even if it did work, why do you have the right to chose what your neighbor does with his life?
My eyes are open, esepcially to the reality that the war on drugs has destroyed more minority communities and aspirations (try get a job with a weed conviction as a black male...) than drug use ever did.

I liked the article because it discussed why he is in a high-security with terrorists when his crime is non-violent. I don't think it was too pro-Silk Road as an article, although there were some quotes from his mother and no quotes from anyone on the other side to counter what she said, so I guess there is that.
Regardless of politics, libertarian or not, drug criminals/cyber crime/internet freedom activism is not terrorism, surely?

Which crimes? Running a website?

I'm with you on this. As for freeing him, at the very least he needs a light at the end of the tunnel, not Life without Parole

That's interesting actually.. kind of like a three-strikes law, in a way. But all at once.

I think it was two agents. But yeah, naive for sure and thats another reason I don't think he should be in prison alongside Al Qaeda

He wasn't charged for that crime though, and I also read in WIRED that the cops involved in his case were charged for corruption during his case. 
I'm just not convinced he's a totally bad guy that deserves to be in prison for the rest of his life.

I'm pretty sure that there was no illegal porn allowed or stolen goods allowed.
Also drug sales = victimless crime. Life without parole in a maximum security prison for facilitating drug sales? murderers get less.

I'm quite the libertarian, so my response to the above will be something you've probably heard a million times before haha. 
I get your argument though, but for me it is a person's choice what they put in their body. And the drug war targets and ruins minority communities worse that the drugs themselves do.

So in the article it says that the minimum was 20 years or something along those lines, but he got LWP. That was indeed the judge's decision.

Probably yeah, maybe he's a little arrogant
