This is going to be unpopular. Money has no value, its the value you give it. Honestly, say youre the person who owned bitcoin when it was dirt, then again when its something significant, has it changed you? And for how? There is consequences for action both “good” and bad, but what matters is person. How is it going to change you? Is it? Then you have to wonder, how would it change your life. You could do things, you could learn things, you could taste things, feel, but would your heart really change? For the better? People live life and look for what they desire and think things or doing stuff will solve it, does it really? Or is the center of your heart stay? Money, in this world will come and go, what you can afford, buy, hell, even buy for other people doesnt change who you are. Dont let your life be determined by things that could all be gone tomorrow.

I need a 4gig flash which i do not have, and "paper wallet" lol
@_date: 2016-11-28 14:48:41
damnit. I dont have tails. basically my issue is I have like 10usd. I have breadwallet, but I need to transfer to something that wont track or erases, whatever. I mention the amount because I know usually the secure sites or hosts have transaction minimum or deposit minimum or fees

fuck.... I mean something I dont need on a device. period. I would like to get tails and install a wallet on it, however I dont have it. I have bread, but I dont want bit tracked on my devices.I guess im referring to a website host.

to be fair, i thought "paper wallet" was a joke. like a physical paper wallet. didnt know its an actual thing. also, i have a question, like kind of dumb but may be you can answer for me since im a noob.

Thanks, didnt think about the last part.

Also, theres no definite stock for btc usd, like the actual bitcoin. And you would have to buy stock at whole price versus part of it like actually buying bitcoin.

My brokers for my bank called me to say hi, mostly because i started an investment account. I asked about bitcoin, they plainly said “we dont work with it because if the federal regulations thing and no body really knows what it is” 
It was wells fargo fyi

Whats going on with bcash now? A lot of positive reviews. As well as it being 1k value. Also, a lot of retailers are just using it, and there was a post saying main was going to become cash again.

I was going to buy with bread wallet or robinhood. 
Yeah, i heard or rather “saw” all the posts about “this is the best” from someone who hacked the mod account?

You do realize word comes from one mouth or another, why do you think im asking a general question in the hub of it all
