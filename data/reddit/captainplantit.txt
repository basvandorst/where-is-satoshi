So your comment prompted me to read up on this. The current protocol prioritizes transactions based on the time of receipt, so a miner would be breaking with the protocol to accept double spends of the nature you described. While it might be a good way for a miner to pick up a marginally larger sum of money, it would undermine the legitimacy of bitcoin and the pool that did it. If you've sunk thousands of dollars into equipment that can only mine one thing, it's in your best interest to ensure that Bitcoin retains value and legitimacy.
Even if a chunk of miners started accepting these types of transactions you would still have to be lucky enough to double spend in a block that they mined. So it would be an incredibly unreliable way to try and get something for nothing.
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:05:48
Now I see what you're saying. That's a lot contingencies though. Any one of those independently would probably impact Bitcoin materially.

This happened to my girlfriend as well literally a couple of days ago. Canceled 'suspicious' order after 5 or so days from the purchase. She has been verified since February and this was her first purchase since then, kept the Bitcoin in the account even so it's not like someone could claim she was reselling. Also 2FA enabled so it's pretty clear it's her when she logs in. 
I was so angry when she forwarded that cancellation email to me. I'm sorry, it's suspicious that someone with a 9 month verified bank account and credit card wants to buy bitcoin from you at the price you specified and you just canceled the order without even reaching out to the customer to clarify if you had an issue? 
Fuck that. Such a stupid move. I've been using Circle since it's cheaper all-in and will likely continue to after her experience. 
**EDIT**: the bottom of the email body also suggested she might 'try again in a few weeks'. That blew me away. I find THAT suspicious Coinbase!!

A sales tax would actually be pretty easily implemented in a psuedonymous economy if it was designed similar to [the FairTax]( The FairTax basically turns retailers into the tax collectors and gives them a portion of the tax they collect as an incentive to accurately collect it and cover the costs of compliance.
So if it's in the retailer's financial interest to collect the tax and there is risk associated with non-compliance there would actually probably be better tax compliance under that system than what we have now.
One of the other key components of the FairTax is its prebate, which is a monthly check to every citizen to cover the sales tax that would be incurred for someone at a threshold income level that spends 100% of their earned income. So if you make less than this amount, it's actually a form of welfare. This idea could be taken a step further to generate a basic income and thereby do away with all other forms of welfare.
The big complaint against FairTax is that it's conceivably regressive at higher income levels where the typical proportion of the income that goes towards consumption is lower. I think this "negative" aspect of the FairTax (I personally don't see it as a negative) is offset by the fact that the FairTax discourages consumption generated through borrowing.
Kind of digressed from your original question, but moving away from a personal income tax is something I'm really passionate about.

I like the BitPay integration, though the one nice thing about what Erowid does (where they have one static address that all funds go into) is:
1) We know how much we have raised as a community and you can see your contribution increasing it
2) There are no arbitrary daily value caps, if someone decides to send you 1,000 BTC then you get 1,000 BTC
To the extent you are not immediately converting BTC to fiat, perhaps a static address would better suit MPP's needs?

As of right now, most projects just pay out 1% of the tip pool for each newly accepted commit. While imperfect, this is a very simple automated mechanism that should be seen as a supplement to alternative methods of funding. 
My favorite thing about Tip4Commit is anyone can be paid for contributing to an open source project that has been funded. So even if you're an irregular or new contributor you can be recognized. I think this can help get a lot of new people involved in open source generally and bitcoin development specifically.

If we can use donations to drive hashing power to P2Pool in the short-term, it actually becomes self-sustaining at a certain point. Even if it's initially drawn to the pool because of a subsidy, once it's there more hashing power = lower payout variance. Lower payout variance begets more hashing power, etc. etc.
So donations actually could be a really powerful way to kick start P2Pool.

Tip4Commit is an open source service that collects anonymous or public donations and pays out 1% of the tip pool for each newly accepted commit (contribution).

I think changetip and denominating in bits changes the game. No transaction fee and people feel like they're getting something more than a fraction of one unit. It allows for a dogecoin culture of tips so easily.

I could be a market maker in apples if I go around telling people they can buy apples from me for $1.10 or sell apples to me for $0.90. As long as I'm appropriately managing my inventory, I make $0.20 every time I cross the spread. 
A buyer benefits from a robust market maker environment because they can access liquidity really easily. Lowering the bid/ask spread also inherently lowers volatility. So it's kind of a win all around when there's a system that encourages this.

For folks familiar with spreadsheets and Excel, I explain bitcoin as 'a distributed ledger system, like a big Excel spreadsheet that houses how much bitcoin each address controls. You can tell the ledger to move bitcoin from one address to another by using the private key (password)'. 
I explain mining as 'solving a problem kind of like a Sudoku: something that's easy to check if it's right but hard to solve'. 
You can beat me up about 'that's not technically correct' and everything but I am going for the 80/20 approach (paretos law): explaining 80% of the functionality with 20% of the complexity.

Well said. Implementing the privacy features of something like Zerocoin in the Bitcoin protocol is probably unnecessary as we see Zerocoin developed into its own altcoin. 
Why do I say that? Well, as we continue to expand the network of Bitcoin, we have already seen it become the de facto reserve cyrptocurrency for accessing other altcoins. So if I want Litecoin and I have fiat, I will probably buy Bitcoin first and then purchase Litecoin with it on an exchange. Once we see Zerocoin released as an altcoin, the same will likely happen. 
It's impossible to prevent this type of exchange: Bitcoin for Zerocoin. You could certainly create a decentralized marketplace that would be impossible to take down. If I want to break the chain of ownership on my Bitcoin, I could buy Zerocoin with them and then turn back around and buy Bitcoin with the Zerocoin. 
So without implementing the Zerocoin functionality in Bitcoin, it can still leverage it. And in some ways, I think having a publicly viewable ledger is valuable. I can publicly prove that a certain transaction took place in Bitcoin, whereas (as I understand it) I couldn't do that in Zerocoin.

Hi Olaf,
Thanks for taking the time to reply to this so quickly. I think everyone understands that Coinbase is under a lot of pressure from a lot of different parties. 
Here are the issues as I see them with the current flagging system and why it has caused so much consternation:
* I may be mistaken, but Coinbase should know almost instantly if a transaction is high risk and let the user know immediately rather than waiting 5-7 days to tell them "oh hey yeah no bitcoin for you"
* the email gives no reason as to why you're flagged as high risk, making it feel very arbitrary
* the email does not offer any recourse, and simply says better luck next time if you try again in a few weeks. Given you *know* that this system creates a lot of false positives, shouldn't you build in some sort of ticketing system the user can initiate directly from this email?
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:45:33
I've said this earlier, but my big issue is that there is no option presented in the email to reverse this decision. They simply say better luck next time if you try again in a few weeks. Very frustrating, especially since they know they get a lot of false positives.

I'm very sorry to hear that. It's really hard to lose someone to an overdose.
As a clarification, if you misrepresent what you're selling that's fraud which is still a violation of the non-agression principle. Not sure how that individual died (whether it was misrepresentation of the substance or if the individual just took too much). If it was an overdose by way of the user just taking way too much, I would argue that that is not the vendors fault. If someone dies from caffeine overdose, it's still tragic but we don't blame the vendor.

For gambling, over enough iterations of the the game you are guaranteed to lose every penny you have.
Buy and hold investing of a diversified portfolio generally has a positive payoff expectation/reality at some point in the future somewhat subject to whether what you paid for your assets was expensive/cheap (e.g., you are up on the S&amp;P 500 if you bought in 2000 or 2009, but by MUCH different annualized rates given how expensive 2000 was and how cheap 2009 was). 
If you have lots of lots of experience investing in other assets (this includes having losing positions!) you can have as much exposure to Bitcoin as you want IMO, you just need to be comfortable with the volatility. 
The reason the 'don't invest what you can't afford to lose' maxim is so important with Bitcoin is:
* there are a lot of people here who haven't really invested before and don't understand the value of diversification 
* because of the exceptional volatility in bitcoin, if you're not comfortable sitting on at times substantial paper losses for long periods of time it's easy to make rash emotional decisions with this asset (panic buying and selling). It's easier to avoid being too emotional if you have a limited exposure, especially to start
So my two satoshis for anyone thinking of getting into bitcoin is to start small ($100-$1000 or &lt;$100 if you're more just curious). Gain an appreciation for using it and the volatility, and then decide whether you're interested in buying more.

This is a really interesting debate that I personally find myself torn in. On the one had, I think it's really cool that people can use bitcoin to organize themselves in a permission-less manner to fund open source projects they like, and the project maintainer does not have to be involved.
On the other hand, I hear the concern from project maintainers that they did not opt-in to this type of service when they signed up for a github account.
There are other services like Tip4Commit, such as [bountysource]( that allow you to donate to projects without permission, so Tip4Commit isn't the only service doing this.
It's tough. I don't know what the right answer is. I do know there are folks that like the service though (such as myself).

As I understand it, if you're a retailer running a full node then you simply broadcast the transaction you just received to the network and verify that there was not a transaction for those coins occurring prior to your transaction being received. 
As the network infrastructure is further built, this verification of attempted double spend is something that should be able to take place in the span of seconds or potentially milliseconds. If it is an attempted double spend, it'd be exactly like having a credit card be denied ("I'm sorry, your transaction was declined due to insufficient funds. Do you have another payment method?"). 
So even without being confirmed in the blockchain a transaction can still be very secure. Obviously someone correct me if I'm mistaken here. 
EDIT: I could actually see a service popping up that has nodes all over the world and operates as an instant verifying service. You register with them for say a monthly fee and they verify across their nodes around the world that there was not a double spend transaction for what you supposedly just received. I could see someone calling it something like 'InstaVerify'.

The ham sandwich standard
Feb 28th 2014, 22:10 by J.F. | ATLANTA
WHEN the state accuses you of a crime and seizes your assets before trial, thus preventing you from hiring the counsel of your choice, what recourse do you have? That question is at the heart of Kaley v United States, a case the United States Supreme Court issued its decision on this week. The answer, worryingly, seems to be: None.
The case concerns an aspect of civil asset forfeiture (which we have written about before) that allows prosecutors to freeze an indicted defendant's assets before trial if they would be subject to seizure upon conviction. The question is whether defendants can challenge the forfeiture's legitimacy when it was based on a grand-jury indictment. A brief refresher: grand juries do not decide guilt or innocence; they simply decide whether enough evidence exists to charge a defendant with a crime, ie to indict him. Proceedings are usually closed to the public, and indeed to defense attorneys as well. Grand juries usually only hear evidence from the prosecutor. Historically, they had an investigative function as well—they were supposed to scrutinise the government's evidence—but many believe they are now little more than rubber stamps for prosecutors.
In this case, a grand jury indicted Brian and Kerri Kaley on charges of selling stolen medical equipment and laundering the proceeds. The Kaleys contested the allegations: they said the equipment was unwanted excess, and that they should not be charged with stealing something that nobody wanted. That argument convinced a jury to acquit a co-defendant, indicted along with the Kaleys, after the prosecution could not find a single witness who claimed ownership of the allegedly "stolen" devices. But it did not save the Kaleys.
 
When they first learned they were under investigation, the Kaleys took out a $500,000 home-equity loan and used that to pay for a certificate of deposit in that same amount, which they set aside to pay their lawyers. But when the grand jury returned its indictment, the government froze their assets, including the $500,000 certificate of deposit, arguing that those assets were "proceeds" of their alleged crimes. The Kaleys requested a hearing at which they could argue that the assets should not be subject to forfeiture because their alleged conduct was not criminal. They also argued that the forfeiture froze funds they needed to pay the lawyer who had been preparing for two years to defend them. The prosecution even admitted that they could only trace $140,000 in allegedly criminal proceeds to the Kaleys. And so they did the reasonable thing and unfroze $360,000. Just kidding! What the prosecution actually did was indict the Kaleys on conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a much broader forfeiture remit, and allowed the government to seize even more of their assets, including their home. They contended that these seizures prevented them from retaining the counsel of their choice, which the Supreme Court has long held that the Sixth Amendment guarantees, and they contended that they were entitled to a hearing to challenge the freezing of their assets.
In an odd 6-3 split, which found Justices Roberts, Sotomayor and Breyer in the dissenting minority, the court ruled against the Kaleys. Justice Kagan, writing for the majority, says that the Kaleys have no constitutional right to "relitigate" the grand jury's finding of probable cause, which led to their assets being frozen. But as Mr Roberts notes in his dissent, that is not at all what they were seeking. They wanted a hearing not on whether there exists probable cause to charge them with a crime, but on whether their assets should be subject to forfeiture. The prosecution, and Ms Kagan, believes that the two are the same. They are not. As Mr Roberts notes in his dissent, a ruling on the forfeiture alone "would have no necessary legal or logical consequence for the underlying prosecution because it would be based on different evidence and used for a different purpose."  And, of course, nothing would be "relitigated", because nothing was litigated the first time: defendants are not present at a grand jury hearing, nor does the prosecution have any obligation to fairness. As a former judge famously remarked, a competent prosecutor ought to be able to convince a grand jury to "indict a ham sandwich."
Mr Roberts is absolutely correct in noting that Ms Kagan's ruling "pays insufficient respect to the importance of an independent bar as a check on prosecutorial abuse and government overreaching." And in the Kaleys' case, the government has a strong financial incentive to overreach. They froze more than $2m in assets. If the Kaleys win, they get their money back; if they lose, the government gets to keep it.
None of this seems to trouble Ms Kagan, however. For her and her five colleagues, a grand jury's decision, reached after hearing only the prosecution's case, is sufficient to determine whether the government can take everything you own and prevent you from hiring your counsel of choice. The government need not conclusively link the assets seized to the crime; they can simply charge you, allege a link and take everything you own.
Mr Roberts's conclusion is so good it's worth quoting at length: "[F]ew things could do more to 'undermine the criminal justice system's integrity,'... than to allow the Government to initiate a prosecution and then, at its option, disarm its presumptively innocent opponent by depriving him of his counsel of choice—without even an opportunity to be heard. That is the result of the Court's decision in this case, and it is fundamentally at odds with our constitutional tradition and basic notions of fair play."

Drug addiction is scary and it hurts lots of families, friends and loved ones.
Mind-altering substances have existed since man first walked the earth, and nothing we do will ever be able to prevent people who want to use them from getting access to them. Heck, there are drugs in SuperMax prisons so how could we ever keep them off our streets?
Instead of focusing on the symptom so much (drug addiction), we should instead be focused on what drives people to feeling like they need drugs to fill whatever holes they have in their lives.
People that are unhappy or depressed will naturally be drawn to narcotic substances. If your average happiness (on a hypothetical 1-100 scale) is 20, and a substance can take you to an 80, that's earth shattering. You may have never felt that happy before in your entire life. If your average happiness were say a 70, going to 80 is pretty sweet but it's less likely to become an obsession of yours because the improvement delta is relatively small.
And to be clear, there are many many people that use even the hardest drugs and don't have issues with psychological addiction.
If drug addicts were able to cheaply access their fix (it would be incredibly cheap if we didn't have prohibition) from a safe vendor with clear dosing guidelines, and allowed to live in an environment where it was OK to seek out help for addiction, wouldn't that be better than what we have now? No more people dying from sharing needles, from fear of being thrown in jail for asking for help, or from needing to rob and steal to pay for their coveted substance.
People have gambling problems, sex problems, food problems, you name it. Instead of punishing everyone because a few people can't control themselves, we should provide an environment where people have full control over what they do with their bodies and personal property but it's OK to seek help. That's really the only way forward IMO

Some projects do have that nuance that allows maintainers to award more for certain commits over others, but it does open up the payment system to bias in terms of perceptions of critical vs. non-critical. I personally prefer the 1% per commit and then relying on maintainers to make sure the commits are actually valuable.

You need to zoom out a little bit on your chart for some perspective. The price of Bitcoin has been growing logarithmically. If these venture capitalists are successful, this will help the price of Bitcoin because they are adding value to the protocol by building on top of it.
Take a deep breath, and if it's stressing you out take a break from looking at the price for a while.

For some context, [here's a pretty good thread]( on ycombinator that discusses some of the pros and cons of this type of remuneration system.
My personal take is the following:
1) [Smaller commits are generally better]( so I don't think people should be spending months on one massive commit anyways
2) If a commit is valuable enough to be accepted to a project, it should probably receive a tip. This is open source: if you're trying to make money this isn't what you're working on. People are doing this to support projects they really believe in, and no one wants to be "that guy" who's submitting lots of worthless commits. The pride and respect you get from being a solid contributor is far more valuable than the amounts at stake in these tips
Overall I think this is a great way to encourage new and irregular contributors to participate in open source, and for the main devs I like to think this is a nice little "bonus" for all of the hard work they do everyday. Is it perfectly fair? Absolutely not. But it's transparent and decentralized, and a lot better than any other services I've found.

Many miners could jump, but as long as there was still some miners on the fixed 21M fork blocks would still be created and the network would go on.  Until difficulty readjusted there would be a while between blocks though.

Very well written and reasoned. I agree that scarcity is not the end-all-be-all, however I take issue with your argument in favor of potentially redistributing 'lost' coins to their 'rightful owners'. 
**The only way to prove ownership of Bitcoin is to sign with the private key**. If you don't have the private key, you don't own those Bitcoins, plain and simple. Redistributing existing Bitcoin to someone that cannot prove ownership through possession of the corresponding private key violates the entire premise of Bitcoin. 
There are people all over the world, especially those that were involved in the early days of Bitcoin, that have lost their private keys. But the fact of the matter is they cannot prove they currently own them without possessing the keys.

I remember when I first saw that [youtube video]( of you discussing cyrptocurrencies with a few people over lunch and thinking to myself "wow, that guy knows what he's talking about, I should pay attention to what he says". This was back when I was just getting into Bitcoin, and helped convince me of the awesome power of decentralized consensus.
Your [talk at Coinscrum]( was downright electric, and your confidence and enthusiasm is infectious. I think my favorite talk of yours though was how [Bitcoin threatens financial regulatory]( capture and will save capitalism, because in 7 minutes you were able to convey such a powerful message. Your speaking style is like an ongoing application of Occam's razor in the realm of spoken word. 
I'm guessing people probably give you a hard time for how blunt and straightforward you can be, but I find it incredibly refreshing in a world with a seemingly never ending supply of bullshit (working every day surrounded by corporate-speak as a management consultant has made me especially appreciative of this).

Anything more than one hour for a tx confirmation in my experience is because the transaction didn't have the appropriate fee. So as long as the new customer attaches an appropriate fee 1 hour is probably the maximum of how long someone would have to wait for a confirmation (excluding a scenario where a lot of hashing power is suddenly pulled from the network). 
At some point merchants will be able to pay the tx fee for you, but we're not quite there yet.

Criticism would be that since you can use iDeal to buy bitcoin and it doesn't have charge backs it lessens the need for bitcoin as a payment system in the first place.

Yeah I hear you. I'm not trying to say that that economic interest would necessarily create a *sufficient* incentive for all bitcoin holders to run a full node (especially given how technically challenging it is, not to mention cost of running). But the economic interest is certainly greater than zero, which I don't think some folks appreciate when they talk about incentivizing the operation of a full node.
**EDIT**: now I'm also wondering how someone could ensure they only reward honest nodes. If it's just a blind tip to all nodes, that's technically subsidizing malevolent nodes too I suppose...
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:38:44
Investors want an increase in value, not volatility. Many investors use volatility as a proxy for risk, so they're looking for the highest "risk-adjusted" return. 
Consumers need bitcoin to increase in value so that it can absorb more trade, so these interests are aligned. 
Option buyers and day traders want volatility, not buy and hold investors.

I agree with Friedman here, but more from an efficient market's perspective.
Consider someone looking to buy Bitcoin before the actual announcement but after the "insider" had begun selling. Had the insider been prevented from selling and pushing the price down, the buyer would have paid an artificially inflated price that was not as reflective of Gox's reality.
So while that insider was able to capitalize on information the market didn't have, as a result of their sale they made the market more efficient in terms of reflecting the reality of the situation.

First off, everything will achieve equilibrium over time. It's just a question of how it gets there (whether it be gradual with minor recessions or violent with full blown collapses). I frankly think housing prices are overvalued partially because of the interest tax deduction and also because they are used as a store of value against inflation. If a fixed supply currency helps make it less appealing to pump up these housing prices then that's probably a good thing. 
But let's talk about the pros of fixed supply currency for a second. **If you are working in the US, every year your salary has to increase by ~2-3% in order for you to be earning the same amount in real terms to account for inflation**. So in order for you to stay at the same level, you have to get a raise every single year, and in order for it to be a *real* raise it has to be more than this. 
**With a fixed supply currency, if you get a raise, it's a real god damn raise**.  So you don't have to fight for a raise to stay at the same level, it's going to happen anyways. 
Inflation also represents another form of tax beyond income, sales, property, death, etc. etc. taxes because it's the government that spends that money into existence. So not only are you not needing to get a raise every year to just stay afloat, you're also paying less in taxes. 
If a solid currency helps to stem the massive rise of credit usage, then to me that's a good thing. Better to stop this massive credit bubble now than let it pop again in 10-15 years (or sooner).

You also might check that it's not your firewall that's blocking port 8333. A quick check I did was just to disable it momentarily and then see if the port was then recognized. If that is in fact the case that it's your firewall, it's possible to add exceptions for the port for ingoing and outgoing communications.
One thing I also found was that my computer's internal IP as far as my router was concerned changed depending on which ethernet outlet on the router it was plugged in to. So if you're port forwarding on your router make sure the right internal IP address is in there for your computer you want to be the node.

Pretty sure loose federal reserve monetary policy paved the way for the '07/08 crash. Naked shorts likely helped to bring equilibrium about sooner rather than later. 
You would have thought Greenspan had learned his lesson about asset bubbles from the dotcom bubble, but then you'd be wrong. But Bitcoin on the other hand, that he knows is a bubble so watch out! 
**EDIT** unless you're confusing naked shorts with credit default swaps, which were also influential in exacerbating the crisis. But that had more to do with people under appreciating black swan events and underpricing risk. Ah, the days when Italian debt traded for almost exactly the same as German debt...

If you had an autonomous entity (potentially built on the Ethereum protocol) accepting Zerocoin votes, then I think that could work (assuming I understand Zerocoin right). 
If the transactions were anonymous but the balance of the 'yes' and 'no' or "Candidate A" and "Candidate B" votes were forced to be displayed publicly by the autonomous entity, then you've potentially solved the traceability problem you identified. Conceivably there's also some sort of encryption method that could be used with Bitcoin that would make Zerocoin unnecessary (e.g., the stealth address system for Bitcoin people have been talking about).

Few thoughts:
* it feels like the SatoshiLabs team is reacting far too emotionally at this point and making rash decisions without fully thinking through the consequences; they should take a step back and cool off, and consider reverting any changes they've made already until they've had some time to plot out a cogent action plan
* I think they also need to be a little more confident in their product; I can go to Target and buy branded and unbranded saline solution, unbranded being tremendously cheaper and essentially the same product and yet the branded companies have no problem turning a profit
* pricing needs to be re-assessed, but I could have told you that before this copy cat issue even came into play; you put the price at $85, which is approximately ~3x the BWallet, and I don't see there being any issues with sales; If this was an MP3 player maybe it'd be different, but I'm not going to trust my money with some jenky Chinese-made device running a version of the TREZOR software
**TL;DR** WTF slush0 and SatoshiLabs, where's the faith in your product?
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:39:06
I think you're underestimating the value of a brand and ease of use. TREZOR's biggest and most profitable consumer segment is going to be the people that don't trust themselves with security and may not be very sophisticated with technology. All they care about is 'is this product easy to use and is it secure'. You're talking about a device that is essentially a digital safe, something you need to work EVERY time and feel 100% confident in. 
People are willing to pay a premium for the real deal, and TREZOR has a tremendous brand in this space right now. They should take the high road and focus on the consumer that's going to drive the real future profit. 
Edit: hell, people pay premiums for name brand breakfast cereal and shaving cream, and those are consumables that have essentially the same ingredients. Now you think of if a Prius was open source and some other company made a knock off one, which one would you actually trust to transport your family? How much of a premium would you pay in that case relative to the premium for name brand breakfast cereal?

@_date: 2017-08-22 04:10:45
It's 140 characters. Assuming he thinks of it the same way as Wikipedia defines it then I'd say it says a lot


@_date: 2017-08-22 16:33:20
This is a non-backward compatible upgrade, so 95%+ of nodes need to be upgraded to prevent a potentially disastrous split if there's not replay protection in the hard fork. 2x compatible code is not even available for those running Core, so how could you possibly expect everyone across the globe (many that probably don't even pay attention to things like Reddit) to upgrade by November?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:46:59
A hard fork is required to add replay protection. Core and many users do not want to roll out a hard fork in 3 months, hence a large portion of the opposition to 2x in the first place.
So yes, it is incumbent on the hardforking group to add replay protection, since they're already executing a non-backwards compatible change.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:54:28
He left Core to start up BitcoinXT with Mike Hearn in 2014 I believe. The intent then was the same as all the others since then: to replace the Core team.
It was not successful.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:35:36
In that situation (full network separation of nodes and miners), the value of both coins would plummet. As miners are marginal producers that sell almost immediately to cover electricity cost, it is hopefully unlikely that they would voluntarily destroy the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:42:04
It's not about how quick it is to code it. You still have to exhaustively test it (we're talking about a $60B+ value network here, small mistakes are not acceptable) and then it has to be rolled out and then patched to nodes. Some node operators have custom implementations, so their upgrade process will be longer.


Because if half of Core users upgrade to replay protection, half don't, and another group goes with BTC1 then we now have 4 forks of Bitcoin with BCH!
Replay protection is a non-backward compatible change. That's the point of it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:04:40
Absolutely, and don't get me wrong miners are still an incredibly important part of why Bitcoin is able to work.
There has however been a tremendous amount of centralization in mining with the rise of ASICs, and I think miners began to think of themselves as the ones with the power to decide the future of Bitcoin, not the end users running full nodes. 
At the end of the day, the valid chain with the most proof of work is still Bitcoin, but miners do not get to determine what is 'valid' purely because of their hashing power.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:09:32
Have you looked at the node distribution between Core nodes and BTC1 nodes? The network clearly is not in vast majority support of a hard fork, so it is incumbent on the splitting entity to protect user balances.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:36:08
Understood, thanks for clarifying
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:23:43
What about users Erik? It is extremely clear that there isn't even *majority* support amongst users for a hard fork at this time (especially not with most big blockers on the BCH chain) 
As of right now, more than 75% of all nodes are Core enforcing.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:31:12
Miners are compensated to help secure the network. Nodes enforce honesty in miners. Just because 90% of miners could decide to have 50 BTC block rewards again indefinitely, and no 21M limit on BTC does not mean that that would suddenly become bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:14:18
This will continue to be an issue with any successful cryptocurrency unless one of the two following outcomes happens:

* 2nd layer solutions (e.g., Lightning network) become prevalent and common place
Decentralized will always be more expensive than centralized at the base protocol layer.

I'm just including UASF nodes as "Core enforcing" because the only change they have from the Core implementation was to enforce SegWit signaling as of August 1st, which is a moot point now. 


A hard fork requires overwhelming consensus on all fronts: nodes, miners, developers and businesses. The fact 2x has only one of these (miners) and some businesses (though some such as Bitwala are defecting) is not sufficient to claim it has consensus for a backwards incompatible change (at least without replay protection). As we've seen with BCH, miners will mine what is most profitable to them in the short-term and cannot be solely relied upon to define what is "bitcoin".


This is why it's important to run your own node. Regardless, it'd be pretty easy to tell these were fake nodes if they all spun up at the same time.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:54:34
Yes, that's exactly what it is. Because of the EDA it's just more gameable so this switching behavior will happen until/unless the price of BCH falls quite a bit. 
It should help some groups back out of the NYA though, since we've seen a lot of miners going to BCH which conceivably invalidates the 2x agreement.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:34:59
And for anyone wondering, I'm including UASF nodes in the "Core enforcing" total
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:35:37
If all the miners decided to have 50 BTC block rewards indefinitely and to remove the 21M coin cap, all the nodes on the network would reject them and they'd be off on their own.

After watching approx. half of bitcoin's hashing power switch to BCH, violating the NYA, why would anyone expect the miners to do what they said they would do?
You've got businesses bailing left and right, users don't want this, and the only thing NYA backers are holding onto is mining power, which clearly couldn't give a flying f*ck and will mine whatever is most profitable in the short-term.

What does UASF have to do with any of this? All I'm saying is 2x does not have a "super-majority" as some of their supporters claim. That is all.
Doesn't matter if 90% of miners decided to change the block reward to 50 BTC indefinitely and blow past 21M total coins, the predominance of nodes would reject their blocks and they'd be off on their own.

There is no mention of ASICs or mining pools in that post (it's from 2009, well before any of that).

I think those odds are pretty realistic considering this bet is whether Segwit will activate in a little over 2 months. We have up to a year for it to activate.

@_date: 2017-08-22 15:31:43
Couple thoughts:
* While I agree *Short-term* node count is less meaningful, the number and percentage of nodes enforcing Core has not varied that much over the last 6 months
* I think you're missing the point on the node representation. I'm not asserting that Core has a super-majority, just that BTC1 clearly, from node representation does not have a super-majority. The network as of right now suggests that the predominance of nodes on the network would ignore miners mining 2x blocks in November, so I find it highly dubious that 2x supporters could claim BTC1 has 90%+ support from economic users

Increases in the price of bitcoin are a moot point. You could just as effectively capture that increase by taking the money that you would invest in a miner and instead put it towards actual BTC.
If expected BTC generation of the miner is less than how much you could acquire at current price, then it reflects an opportunity cost and is a poor investment.

You're assuming that miners doing 2x without meaningful consensus wouldn't have a negative impact on price. Miners for the most part are marginal producers that sell what they mine almost immediately, so they are very sensitive to short-term price movements.
Without replay protection, both chains will be essentially unusable, and miner profitability will plummet. Hopefully they will realize this before it's too late.
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:31:44
I'm very skeptical about your derivatives claim. Every derivative is a two sided bet that involves at least two parties, and banks will typically create net zero (or highly minimized) exposure by taking offsetting bets with different clients.

@_date: 2017-08-21 15:24:33
Since it cannot be used to increase the number of coins released in total or per reward halving cycle all it does it create a system that is more easily gameable by miners.
Expected outcome of miners playing with the hash rate so dramatically would be for the coin to lose value, which eventually will make it not worthwhile to speculate in to begin with.

Perfect time to buy bitcoin was when it was less than $0.01. This is probably a fine time too, especially with less than a year to halving of the block reward.

Game theory comes into play though. Say economic consensus only has 30% of the hashing capability. The other 70% can: 1) mine on a chain no one cares about 2) mine honestly on the economic majority chain OR 3) attempt a 51% 'scorched earth' attack on the economic consensus chain.

'Too conservative' was an inappropriate way for me to frame it.

BIP 101 as currently implemented by **[REDACTED]** requires a 75% threshold to activate. But realistically if the economic consensus was to go a different route than 75% of the miners wanted, as long as they had &gt;0 hashing capability they could use a different set of protocol rules. Miners have some say, but we could all just listen to a different fork and ignore them if push came to shove. 
It's not an optimal outcome, but miners should recognize they have checks on their power as well. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:41:11
Strictly related to the block size, I really hope something more along the lines of BIP101 gets adopted instead of BIP100. This whole notion of miners voting is going to be incredibly messy, and introduces quite a bit of potential volatility to the maximum block size. Having a voting system also exposes us to new attack vectors.
Beyond the block size, I think we will eventually need to migrate away from Core as the "reference" implementation. The development climate there feels excessively caustic and ~~conservative~~ exclusive, and we wouldn't even be having this block size debate if **[REDACTED]** hadn't forced the issue. I'll be running a **[REDACTED]** node for the foreseeable future, and would prefer if that implementation gradually gained consensus over Core.
I'll take Andresen and Hearn's relative civility and practicality over the other Core devs any day.

@_date: 2015-08-20 21:34:33
I understand your point on supply caps to achieve economic goals, however while the 21 million BTC cap was intentional and well thought out, the 1 MB cap was intended to be a temporary stop-gap measure to prevent spamming of the blockchain. 
The arguments in favor of keeping the 1 MB cap came *after* it was implemented and feel more like an ex-post rationalization. 
Even under the current fee paradigm assuming large blocks LN could still make economic sense for micropayments and regular exchanges between groups or individuals that could be settled intermittently rather than every transaction. To me this suggests it's not an *either/or* tradeoff between larger blocks and the opportunity for LN to absorb transactions.
My personal hope is that we can find a compromise between **[REDACTED]** and maintenance of the 1 MB cap, such that concerns over large blocks creating centralization are partially addressed while also supporting the founding vision of bitcoin to allow blockchain transaction accessibility to average users.
@_date: 2015-08-19 06:45:39
In regards to OP's title, I don't think anyone is knocking the core devs. Most of those supporting bitcoin [REDACTED] are doing so to try and expedite compromise. 
It's also hilariously Soviet that a) I have to redact that and b) those behind [REDACTED] cannot come onto this subreddit to defend their approach. We're getting an incredibly one-sided discussion that's not productive for bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-20 21:18:47


I understand your point that keeping the 1 MB block size in perpetuity makes it more feasible for any regular computer to be a node, however if only large businesses/institutions and LN operators can afford to actually conduct transactions on the blockchain then I don't know why regular people would bother running a node. It might actually create the same centralization problems you're concerned about from large blocks, since those few groups actually conducting on-chain transactions may be the only groups that feel compelled to run a full node. 
Alternatively, while increasing block size could conceivably make it more difficult for the average computer to be a node, the fact that the predominance of transactions takes place on the blockchain likely creates more interest in the average user to perform their own validation of the blockchain with their own node. So one could argue that while larger blocks are more hardware intensive, the fact that they can accommodate more users could actually *increase* interest in running a full node and actually provide better decentralization.


My concern here would be:
a) given bitcoin's propensity for boom and bust cycles, we could very quickly be in a situation where the 1 MB block size is cramping uptake and disrupting the ability of users to use bitcoin. I'm not confident that we could achieve consensus among core developers, deploy an updated version of core and then achieve consensus in the network fast enough for damage to be prevented
b) the fact that there is currently a cap on the number of transactions per block through the 1 MB limit may already be limiting adoption as prospective users may be concerned the network can scale to accommodate new users

@_date: 2015-08-20 19:18:47
But you acknowledge that in order for LN to be developed fees have to increase well beyond what people are currently paying now, yes? That's all I'm trying to drive at. 
If users are arbitrarily forced to pay more per tx then they are now for LN to be developed then LN is not an elegant solution. It's gambling with the future of bitcoin that LN will be possible and successful, and I do not want to take that wager. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:59:26
Using redacted is necessary. Per Theymos' stickied front page post:




To your statement: 


a) it's not the only other possible solution; a compromise on block size increase could be adopted in bitcoin core (e.g., go to 2 mb to allow other solutions to be developed in the interim)
b) We don't know if LN will actually be able to be successfully developed, so while promising and something we should pursue is not something we should look to as our savior and completely ignore the prospective need to increase the block size. As I noted, I see **[REDACTED]** as a backup plan in the event of us being negatively impacted by the arbitrary 1MB cap.
@_date: 2015-08-20 18:41:02
My humor detection on the internet is not always on point :) thanks for clarifying. 
If LN requires artificially high transaction fees to be developed then I would argue it's not actually the more elegant solution. You're advocating we arbitrarily restrict possible transaction volume for the *possibility* of LN. What happens if we discover LN isn't workable in the real world? We will have handicapped bitcoin's growth and have nothing to show for it. 
I'm not concerned about a sustainable fee market developing in the future as its needed, even with unlimited block size. Miners can choose which transactions to include or not include, and a scenario where there are few transactions and those that take place are low fee suggests a world where bitcoin was not actually successful. In that paradigm LN would be worthless, since it suggests people aren't willing to use Bitcoin even if there's a low fee. 
You're suggesting we fundamentally alter the Bitcoin user value proposition because LN *might* work. I think that's reckless and silly. 
**TL;DR**: IMO if LN isn't feasible without arbitrarily high tx fees then it's not actually a more elegant solution.

Ever heard the saying "don't put all your eggs in one basket"? You're basically advocating that no other solutions be identified because LN could potentially address the issue. **[REDACTED]** would not engage unless there is 75% mining support for it after 1/11/16, more than 4 months away. Almost half a year doesn't feel like "urgency" is being pushed on people.
My hypothesis is **[REDACTED]** will not achieve 75% miner support unless we start to be negatively impacted by the 1MB block size. If LN comes about before that's an issue and is an economically viable solution then **[REDACTED]** could become irrelevant and simply a backup plan that never had to be used.

A market order in that kind of volatility is a bold play call, since you don't necessarily know what price you're buying or selling into by the time it executes. 
A good piece of advice I saw on was to place a limit order slightly below/above where you actually want to enter the trade. It will still give you the best available bid/ask and worst case you won't buy or sell for some outrageous price because the market was moving faster than you could react/the trading engine could process.

I remember when SegWit came out in the heart of the block size debate and it felt like mana from heaven. Folks on both sides of the table agreed it was a clever solution, and for a moment there it actually felt like this issue had been temporarily resolved. 
Charlie Shrem's recent interview was great because he highlights that the BU vs Core debate is actually about power rather than whether SegWit is good code.

He is relevant because he controls bitcoin.com and their mining pool, and he helps subsidize BU miners. He is not just a random personality.

The only reason not to use SegWit transactions as of right now is there aren't a lot of tools to send Bitcoin using SegWit, but there are more every day so that's changing as developers start building for it.
Otherwise, all a user needs to know is they're cheaper tx. That's why most of the discussion is technical: the end user experience is cheaper transactions so it's a no brainer.
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:08:57
Think of it this way: you sell a large amount of BTC on an exchange, with proceeds going to your bank account. This will likely flag with the IRS either from your bank or the exchange.
If you do not file taxes on this sale, regardless of where the Bitcoin came from, you run a high risk of getting audited, and all the pieces are there to suggest you were evading taxes and will face penalties.
Don't mess with the IRS. Google Al Capone.

Releasing 2x as it's coded now (BTC1) would essentially paralyze both block chains if there's not a clear winner quickly since 2x does not include replay protection. They did this intentionally to try and trick SPV wallets into following the most hashing power if they were in fact able to get 90%+ of miners (which looks dubious if Core chain remains more profitable than 2x as we saw with &gt;50% of miners switching to BCH at some points).
So any transaction will be replayable unless the user takes extra procaution to structure their transaction so it's invalid on the other chain, a relatively technical and complex process.
Your approach from the perspective of a user is accurate though. If things get complicated in November just hodling and waiting for the dust to settle is the best approach.

Start out by investing small amounts, essentially what you wouldn't mind missing if it completely disappeared. Weekly recurring buys are a pretty good way to create exposure without making you obsess about the current price (coinbase offers this).
And then hodl. If you've only invested what you can afford to lose, you won't be kept up at night based on fluctuations in price.
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:51:49
If people are doing what they're supposed to, which is holding their own private keys and not trusting a centralized provider with all their BTC, then this 3rd party software risk is very real if you want to opt in to replay protection.
And unfortunately, if you don't then you're paying the same person twice if you try to send them on either chain ignoring the other. It's just really irresponsible that they wouldn't make replay protection the default.

Agreement was to prevent a fork. Miners set up BCH, and at points more than 50% of total Bitcoin hash power was on that chain because it was temporarily more profitable. So clearly miners didn't hold up their side of the bargain.

You made the right decision to start out with a smaller amount per your comment. Bitcoin swings can at time be pretty violent, and having an amount of money that you're less concerned about what happens to it is the right way to go to help you hold out through downswings without panic selling.
The common Bitcoin maxim 'don't invest more than you're afraid to lose' is absolutely critical for helping to minimize the inclination to panic sell if things start to turn south price-wise.

Some use cases are not applicable to Bitcoin. If you want to use a global ledger to store data, that is a burden on nodes. There's no reason we should subsidize massive companies to do so.
A constrained block size helps to encourage efficient transaction and data usage, and protects decentralization, the most important part of Bitcoin.
The above mentioned use cases could be deployed in a Bitcoin side chain, but shouldn't burden the base protocol layer with excessive data.

The interesting thing is miners have already broken the NYA agreement, which was intended to prevent a chain split. At times ~60% of SHA256 mining power was on the BCH chain, so how could anyone say 90%+ support the NYA and SegWit2x? They clearly will mine whatever is most profitable, as one would expect.
My node and other nodes predominantly suggest BTC1 and SegWit2x won't be viable. I hope NYA signers come to the same conclusion before November.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:53:01
It's a good point to call out, but important to add the context that in the last 24 hours there was almost $6B in Bitcoin that changed hands, and during hotter periods that amount was closer to $10B. For every seller there's a buyer, so that means even if ALL of the mined BTC was sold every day, on a day like today that's 0.2% of the total sellers globally.
It's still something that can weigh on price, but I think the impact at this point is fairly diminished and as you highlight will continue to be more and more insignificant as the block reward shrinks and global exchange volume (hopefully) continues to balloon.

BCH was and is free money. They do not have the technical resources in the form of developers that Bitcoin does and they philosophically excluded SegWit, which means there would be extreme resistance to adopting it in the future. As we start to build up SegWit and lightening-type 2nd layers they will then be unable to essentially copy and paste those to their network.
This will probably take a while to become obvious to the typical user though, as these structural imbalances take some time to become clear.

Not without installing other software that then has access to your private keys or manually writing the transaction yourself (which practically no users would be able to do).
Whereas with BCH, you could spend your BTC to a different address, then load the (now otherwise empty) private keys into Electron Cash and then send the BCH to an exchange or wherever. Because of that you never had to endanger your BTC private keys with potentially insecure new software (though there would be a loss of privacy).

I agree the Bitcoin blacklisting was a terrible idea, and AFAIK it does not exist anywhere in **[REDACTED]**. The IP blacklisting is actually prioritizing non-Tor connections *in the event of a DoS attack*. Assuming all the node's connections aren't full it will still accept Tor connections.

The attack vector I'm talking about is the 21% required to decrease the block size. 
Beyond that, why should we be adding additional complexity, volatility and human fallibility to Bitcoin?

As written, your original statement suggested that BIP 100 and BIP 101 are subject to the same amount of human fallibility as solutions because they both have to be initially implemented as a human decision. 
This is disingenuous, because BIP 100 makes it so humans must vote *~4x per year in perpetuity*. Assuming we never had to soft or hard fork the block size after BIP 101 was implemented, over a long enough time line BIP 100 has *infinitely more human involvement*. 
If BIP 100 didn't allow miners to decrease the block size and only increase it then it'd be slightly more palatable. As it is, 21% could attack the network by shrinking the block size before, say, the holiday shopping season. 
If the increases under BIP 101 were realized to be too aggressive, miners could soft fork to a smaller block size, so they still have power in the end. But with 101 we get to take out the volatility of what the absolute max will be and don't subject ourselves to human votes every ~3 months.

I would bet if they're considering implementing a blockchain that's not bitcoin it will be some sort of shared internal blockchain amongst other institutions. Part of that may be for perceived security, part of it may be a perceived advantage in preventing public parties from snooping on holdings. Most likely it will be fear over perceived lack of control in using the bitcoin blockchain.
Over time I think the network scale bitcoin already has and the open nature of the protocol will push organizations to use that instead of any type of private blockchain. Your security is subsidized through other users and the development in bitcoin will likely far outpace development that could take place on a private blockchain.


I would disagree. People will always hack and try and exploit vulnerabilities, especially at banks. If someone was able to find a way of impersonating an institution on a shared internal blockchain they could wreak havoc and potentially exploit for gain.

* I love that they don't actually spell out any of these supposed security shortfalls
* A transaction 6 confirmations deep in the bitcoin blockchain is essentially immutable; how is this not secure, especially if you're simultaneously hosting your own validation node?
* Even if you're waiting ~1 hour for 6 confirmations and not just ~10 minutes, for asset settlement purposes that's *screamingly* fast. Especially considering the legacy system takes ~3 business days as of right now. That reduces settlement to ~1% of the time it takes right now.

A hard fork without consensus creates an altcoin. BCC will be an altcoin, and they implicitly acknowledge this.
Consensus building is messy, especially in a decentralized system. But I still believe in it. We will have a hard fork when there's a proposal that's so objectively good that there is not technical debate (e.g., SegWit).

100% agreed. I'm fully open to a hard fork at some point down the road, but bitcoin is meant to be digital gold. Security, decentralization, and fungibility should be the first priority, then tx throughput.
**EDIT**: full disclosure, I was originally in favor of Bitcoin XT at the time Hearn and Gavin separated from the Core implementation (this was in 2015 for those new to bitcoin). In my mind, what they were saying at the time made sense: blockchain limit was for anti-spam protection, was not intended to be permanent, we should remove it ASAP. After reading more and more, seeing all the great work Core has done that increases TX throughput without putting in a hardfork, and really reflecting on what gives bitcoin value, I realized how important prudent, conservative changes were. 
When you think about it, having everyone store and share transactions is incredibly inefficient (a central database is much more efficient, but you have to trust the operator and be in good standing with them). But we do it because it's *decentralized and immutable*. We should put this first and foremost for bitcoin to retain and gain value.

My understanding from the mailing list discussion is BTC1 is confident that the hard fork will have overwhelming consensus and thus intentionally want SPV clients to follow them without thinking twice about it. It's putting power over users frankly, and I think it's really messed up.

To do a "dumb" blocksize increase (e.g., 1 MB -&gt; 2 MB) is very straightforward, it's only changing like one line of code if I understand correctly.
So what Back is saying (as of a year ago, article is from May 2016) is that we do all of these low-hanging fixes that make Bitcoin more efficient and better and *then* we look into a hard fork. 
You give engineers what you want to accomplish (more transaction throughput) and then let them come up with the best way to do it. Just because a block size increase is easy for the layman to understand doesn't mean it's the best first step.
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:58:10
Well said. A hardfork to 2 mb so soon after SegWit is:
* a) dangerously fast, and without the consensus needed to avoid a coin split 
* b) completely unnecessary in the short-term; we will already have 60-100%+ more block size for transactions with SegWit alone
* c) completely insufficient in the long term; it will need to be increased again in the future, so why not wait to make a more meaningful change after further study

It has to be 80% of the blocks in the signaling period, which means on average 84% hash rate should get you there but there's still some randomness involved (e.g, signalers could experience a period of bad luck).

You have no way of knowing which will be the minority chain at this point in time. It is incumbent upon the individuals/entities forking bitcoin to provide replay protection, not the original chain that is not changing anything.
It is critical with a hard fork that all users upgrade in time, hence why many have suggested that the timeframe that SegWit2x hopes to accomplish this change is far too aggressive. 
As a separate note, Satoshi's white paper is not a religious text. It was written 8 years ago, prior to the release of the very first implementation of the protocol.

I didn't write that, Peter Todd did. You'd have to read the full chain, but essentially the argument to my understanding is that by not using the nVersion bit, it will be unclear to an SPV (AKA lite) wallet which chain they're actually on, both the hard fork and non-hard fork chains will look the same to it and it will follow the longest proof of work chain. This could result in an SPV wallet thinking it was paid, even though the recipient wasn't on the chain they'd like to follow.
This appears to be by design, with the BTC1 team arguing that they're confident the hard fork chain will have overwhelming economic consensus and it's actually better for SPV wallets if they don't have to change behavior (argument being "SPV clients don't care about block size"). Instead of nVersion bit, BTC1 is forcing the first hard fork block to be &gt;1MB.
Peter is arguing that security is more important than SPV wallets having to distinguish the hard fork version bit if they want to follow that chain.

@_date: 2017-07-10 16:45:53
Thanks for posting, interesting to read how this is beginning to cross over into the MSM. While some look at Ethereum as a direct threat to bitcoin, I'm personally glad it came along and took some of the speculative investors with it. As outlined in the article a $3B valuation for a company with no actual product...lots of dumb money floating around in Ether, and I have a feeling the landing is going to be pretty painful.
As others have noted before, if these ICOs start to monetize their Ether in fiat to lock in some of their funding we could see a massive unwinding in price. I would expect this starts to happen around the price now or maybe sub $200 for Ether...panic starts to replace greed, and there's a lot of dry powder sitting in the hands of a lot of speculative startups to create some more panic selling waves.
The blockchain size for Ethereum also continues to balloon exponentially, meaning they're going to have some pretty gnarly scaling issues of their own soon:
I also personally suspect that a lot of the investors in Ethereum (in contrast to BTC that has a lot of long time hodlers) are less certain about the technical fundamentals of the platform and have relied on price as a proxy to maintain their confidence. As that starts to evaporate there's going to be a lot of people rushing for the exits.
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:25:03
Wallets and exchanges sit on top of the base protocol; lower security traded off for better ease of use is fine at that level. You're talking about making this trade off at the base protocol level which is dangerous.
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:25:35
Even that analogy is still deficient. There are a fixed number of assets that would have to be divided amongst those subsidiary companies, so under no circumstances could the value of one of the split companies be worth the same amount as the parent post-split ceteris paribus.
With a hard fork in bitcoin, it's actually possible that either the forked or non-forked chain could approximate the value of the pre-split coin, specifically if it was either a) a non-contentious hard fork (which SegWit2x is not) or b) was overwhelmingly unsupported by economic nodes, users and miners (at any point someone *can* fork bitcoin, but their fork is not guaranteed to be relevant).
My feeble attempt at an explanation is if you have a spreadsheet with account balances, and someone makes a copy of that and claims it's the new master file. Everyone already in the original spreadsheet technically has 'credits' in each spreadsheet, but depending on the circumstances the market might value those 'credits' very differently based on which spreadsheet you're going off of. Again, really hard to make an analogy because this is such a uniquely new technology.

Again, you don't know what the minority chain will be three months from now! You are also making large, sweeping assumptions about the future and other individuals with that statement. It would be foolish to write software for a $40B currency based on an assumption that the hard fork will be and remain the majority chain.
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:45:07


There's nothing the original chain can do for SPV wallets to prevent issues with a hard fork. Hence why it is incumbent upon the individuals/entities performing the hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:52:53
Did anyone in the BTC1 working group provide an explanation on this design choice? To me it would seem if they would have used the nVersion bit they could have optionally also asked miners to mine the first block of the hard fork to be &gt;1 MB, but then if there wasn't a mempool backlog it wouldn't create the problem they're experiencing now.
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:59:45
These are completely fair points, and this is the kind of hard nosed discussion that should always be happening.
This is the reality that the 'big blocks now' camp tries to ignore, which is that having everyone store every transaction that takes place and is confirmed is pretty darn inefficient. In status quo finance, we use middlemen to get economies of scale. But in return, we have to trust them and they are easy to regulate (and common pursuers of regulatory capture).
So Bitcoin makes a trade off: decentralized, censorship resistant, highly fungible and transportable digital gold. Except even better than gold, bitcoin's final supply will be fixed at 21M, while there is tons of gold in the known universe.
So how do we scale Bitcoin then? The answer is 2nd layer transactions. Lightning payments are approximately trustless, quite private and instant confirming. If successfully implemented, they would also allow for dramatically more real world transactions to take place beyond the transactions settling on the block chain.
We can also pursue Schnorr signatures, which in addition to being more secure also reduce the space needed for transactions. And then others talk about side chains with bigger blocks. There are lots of approaches developers are studying.
My TL;DR answer: not every transaction will be recorded in the block chain, and there is still efficiency to get out of the existing system.
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:01:05

@_date: 2017-07-13 21:53:37
I don't follow; a full node would reject the hard fork chain because it will have a block &gt;1mb. Are you talking about something else?

There are security tradeoffs with a structure where the full blockchain isn't validated and only pruned blocks are stored. It may be de minimis for most users/use cases, but it still exists. 
Processing more transactions on-chain isn't necessarily a success metric for a decentralized immutable blockchain either. Especially not if they require the same or greater storage by nodes for each tx. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:47:06
You do realize SegWit2x is implementing SegWit exactly as Core coded it right? It's fully compatible. The only thing this "new dev team" is doing is trying to code a hard fork for 2 MB blocks. That's it, and its chances do not look good.

The ultimate fall back is miners could just support BIP 148. This would actually be the least risky thing to happen at this point, I'm just not sure whether the powers that be in the mining community would ever 'concede' like that.
Essentially everyone would just start orphaning non-SegWit signaling blocks on August 1 if miners started mining BIP 148 as I understand it.

* Unlike a soft fork, which will not necessarily cause a chain split because it's backwards compatible, a hard fork, unless overwhelmingly adopted (we're talking 95%+ of the network and miners) will result in a chain split. For example, see Ethereum and Ethereum Classic following Ethereum's roll back of the blockchain to revert the DAO hack. It was controversial and now they have two separate blockchains with a shared history, and it was a cluster f*ck when it was first happening because people technically had funds on both chains
* While any hard fork is risky, a hard fork in 3 months is absolute insanity. The code for it hasn't even been finished, nor has the impact of SegWit combined with a 2 MB block size increase (effectively a 4 MB block size) been studied sufficiently to understand whether it's safe, or frankly even necessary to happen so soon
* There are other improvements to the protocol that are on the "wish list" that can only be done with a hard fork. Rather than having to do a bunch of these risky hard forks over and over again, it would be ideal if we could do one and be over with it and not have to touch it again
Bitcoin's fundamental value is in it's censorship resistance, decentralization, and deflationary properties (store of value). Because of this, changes should only be made to the protocol very gradually, since there's currently over $40B in value tied to it, and we can't go around pulling random levers without deeply studying the potential consequences.
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:55:46
Yes, because bitcoin is the original and still has the largest network. If a bunch of speculators want to pump up the value of Ethereum, which from any fundamental economic use perspective is way overvalued, that's their prerogative. When some big ICO crashes, there's another DAO-like event or some other growing pain people are going to have to wake up in a hurry to the fact that their money isn't safe.

If a party is hard set on forking bitcoin, they can and will. The predominance of early altcoins (e.g., Litecoin) are all forks of bitcoin. If bitcoin users and developers don't succumb to the ridiculous demands of miners that we activate a hard fork in 3 months, and do it concurrently with SegWit, then for all intents and purposes all the miners did was create another altcoin with a shared history with bitcoin. They're the ones that will be on a separate chain with essentially no economic value behind it, doesn't matter how long that chain is if bitcoin nodes reject their blocks.


A) there's no conceivable way SegWit2x gets merged into Core on the timeline the miners want and B) there are already multiple groups of developers maintaining separate bitcoin implementations, so that's a moot point.


You forget that the value of what miners are mining is determined by the market, not by them. If they were to perform a hostile attack it would decimate the value of bitcoin, thereby dramatically diminishing their profitability.

You understand that lightning is still bitcoin right? I don't understand this fascination with having every transaction settled on the Layer 1 protocol, it's so inefficient. Who wants to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation to buy a cup of coffee? It makes no sense. 
Regarding node costs, do you actually run a full, accepting inbound connections node? Even at 1mb blocks its very demanding on both your bandwidth and hard drive unless you limit data transfers or prune the blockchain. Then you talk about potentially increasing the average block by ~4x practically overnight with SegWit2x. It doesn't take a genius to see how this will discourage more people from running full nodes. Not to mention, larger blocks heavily favor big miners because they have an advantage building on their own blocks when the rest of the network relies on having it propagated to them.

Someone may be able to improve upon this explanation, but my understanding is that the DNS and domain ownership is built into the Namecoin blockchain.

@_date: 2017-06-20 16:18:04
For a fully validating node, SegWit already approximately doubles the block size, so for the user running a full node you would expect your bandwidth used and disk space used per block to increase materially. A 2 MB fork + SegWit takes the effective max block size to ~4 MB for a fully validating node, which if it happened today would probably force a lot of people to wind down their nodes.
It also has huge ramifications for miner centralization, which as we've seen is already pretty bad right now, and would be expected to be worse with 4 MB blocks. Reason being, if you're a large miner and frequently building on top of your own blocks, you have a big head start on others that rely on propagation of the blocks throughout the network. So it would increase orphan rates and likely force out even more independent miners.
I think for Samurai, a "user" is someone who wants bitcoin to stay decentralized, because they have the most to lose to centralization of super nodes and miners.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:07:29
SegWit is the compromise because it involves no hard fork, when it came out originally everyone universally agreed it was like mana from heaven in the heat of the block size debate.

If it's Bitmain forking to JihanCoin then I don't think we'd lose the developers, since technically the pre-fork would still be original bitcoin and the new fork an alt coin with a shared bitcoin history.
We would temporarily lose some miners though...which might not be the worst thing in the world (just a slow number of weeks resetting the mining difficulty with less hashing power).
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:35:02
Then go use PayPal if that's what you want. Bitcoin is highly inefficient at payments at the base layer of the protocol, because they have to be shared across the network and packaged into an ongoing chain every ~10 minutes. It's only with a 2nd layer (e.g., Lightning) that we could actually achieve the low fee, immediate transactions that users want for day-to-day purchases.
If you're buying a house or a car, then Layer 1 makes sense, but for that you'd be willing to pay for the security of executing at the settlement layer.

You can actually check how your copier will deal with data on the hard drive (i.e. Google search and look at the copier settings).
I was concerned after having to copy my passport once at our work copier, and was very relieved to know that on our copier:
1) Data is randomly allocated among the hard drive, and the FAT file (if memory serves) that works as the index is deleted as the page is printing. This would make it basically impossible to reconstitute a given file, as the index is gone and everything is randomized
2) In addition to deleting the FAT index as it's used, our copier had an additional security package whereby the hard drive was then overwritten with null data. There was also the option to overwrite the hard drive with 1 to 3 passes of random data
At the time I was working for a large multinational, so I imagine they were all over the security since there were far more valuable documents being scanned there than my measly passport (same could probably be said for a bitcoin wallet).
So, be careful. Definitely don't scan anything at Kinkos unless it's encrypted, but if you work for a large company and have newish copier they are probably all over this.

As most comp consultants will tell you, a 3% merit increase in the US right now is considered generous. And that's just to keep pace with expected inflation, you would need more than that to get a real raise. 
Most people (including bosses) do not understand real vs. nominal, so a nominal raise is considered to be a raise. If we priced wages in a non-inflationary asset such as 21M Bitcoin, a wage increase would be a genuine raise.

First off, I said "consider *your* audience". It's kind of weird you would just assume OP is a he. 
I could care less if OP doesn't like Schiff and Korda. I'm a libertarian and I've never followed Schiff and I've never heard of Korda. I also find the distinction of "right vs. left wing" to be a false dichotomy generally created to fit the U.S. two-party system.
But bashing on them because they happen to be "libertarian idealists" or are interested in Austrian economics, Ayn Rand, Ludwig Von Mises or Rothbard **is** ironic, because that's how a good number of individuals, including myself, became interested in sound money and became interested in Bitcoin.
Is this how everyone became interested in Bitcoin? Obviously not, and that is not at all what I said. But considering that's how a good chunk of bitcoiners *did* become interested, OP should consider the audience.

If growth were logarithmic, you would want to basically use it as you needed it by directly spending it or cashing out in weekly, biweekly or monthly increments selling BTC for fiat (smallest feasible timeframe). 
Again, if it kept growing in a logarithmic manner, retiring now on that much BTC would be fine. That is a lot of risk to be taking though. I would personally keep working if I was her, albeit part time. Never want all your eggs in one basket.

You cannot keep people from being stupid. If it's not bitcoin, it's the lottery, online poker sites, just-dice, etc. This community has always done a very good job of emphasizing that people should only invest what they can afford to lose. If people choose to ignore this advice, they have only themselves to blame.
We shouldn't bubble wrap our world just because some people make idiotic financial decisions. There's a good reason that there is the saying "a fool and his/her money are soon separated".

SegWit code has been available and ready for a miner activated soft fork since November 2016, seven months. Anyone saying they haven't had enough time to figure something out is kidding themselves. It took users getting fed up to even get where we are in the first place.
They could activate SegWit right now with BIP 141 but they want to do it through SegWit2x. So fine, it's still signalling on Bit 1 so compatible with existing Core code. But there's absolutely no need for users to install SegWit2x code if they're already running Core, or better yet BIP 148 signalling software.
A hard fork is something that should be studied and evaluated, and ideally combined with other changes that everyone agrees need to be made but require a hard fork. Shoving one down people's throats in such a short period of time is a recipe for disaster.

Here's how I look at it:
I just bought some ASIC block erupters because I thought it would be fun and I would like to support the development of XBT. I got a pretty good deal on them, they're very energy efficient and it's a conversation starter. 
I've also been starting to buy some XBT directly with USD. Depending on the way the market in XBT / USD goes in the near/intermediate term, if you're bullish on XBT in the long-term you are somewhat hedging yourself if you mine and buy directly. This absolutely REQUIRES that you are long-term bullish on XBT. 
If the price of XBT in USD goes down in the short/intermediate term, a lot of mining being done by the non-purists will stop taking place. This should delay difficulty increases and allow you to mine more XBT than you otherwise would. Denominated in USD you're probably losing money, but potentially not as much as if you buy XBT today and the price drops. This paper USD loss will disappear in the long-term if XBT increases in price later. 
If you're also buying XBT directly, if the price goes up in the near/intermediate term you will make a lot more money than mining, and your rig will become obsolete/uneconomical much faster. 
I'm not trying to buy things on SR, but if anonymity is your goal than mining is very helpful for this because there was no fiat transaction that took place to get them (anonymity dissolves if you're mining in a pool and they know your name, etc.). 
Just some thoughts. Other users please feel free to debate me if you feel I'm mistaken.

Yes, most clients default to 0.1 mBTC as the transaction fee right now. 
The price movement didn't really give the developers enough time to find a solution. I'm personally hoping that they switch to a congestion pricing model that allows the fee to fluctuate based on how many other transactions there are at any given time. 
I think Bitcoin is most competitive in a world where the average transaction fee is &lt; $0.02 (which it was before the October sprint), so I'm really hoping they do something about it soon.

I have donated Bitcoin and spent it on random purchases. Each time I simultaneously bought back more BTC than I spent. 
I was originally drawn to Bitcoin because of the philosophical/political power of a decentralized internet currency. You cannot 'freeze' someone's account with Bitcoin, and two humans can engage in commerce over long distances without having to rely on a third party or government backed fiat currency. 
As an investor, I find Bitcoin appealing because it offers a more precisely finite supply than gold and can work as a form of cash over the internet. So it has usefulness and scarcity. 
What's been most impressive to me is the community surrounding Bitcoin and the entrepreneurs and developers that are building on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Better tools to use Bitcoin combined with the network effect of more users multiplies the underlying value. 
Once Bitcoin stabilizes, more people will use it regularly as a traditional currency. But you need depth in market value to provide that stability. At $12B that's difficult to really do. $120B or $1,120B on the other hand can offer much better liquidity and hence stability. 
Not sure if that addresses your question, but that's my two satoshis. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:59:46
I mean, it's not really. The vast majority of full nodes run Core and are ready to activate SegWit right now. It's the miners that have been dragging their feet (at least the 70% miners not already signaling SegWit).
So really, SegWit2x has nothing to do with the typical user. It's the way miners are preparing to activate SegWit. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:57:21
Bitcoins are currently divisible to 8 decimal places, and the protocol could always be adjusted to make them divisible to even more.
That means in the current protocol one Bitcoin has 100,000,000 satoshi units. Multiply that by 21 million...and you get a very large number indeed.
There is no danger of "running out" of bitcoin because of this. One BTC being lost forever just makes everyone else's bitcoin that much more valuable.

Congratulations on your financial success! I would really encourage you to start thinking about what impact you would like to leave on this planet, given you are now approaching a wealth level which grants you a lot of power. 
One of the things that bitcoin does is it unlocks a lot of the shackles imposed by government and crony capitalism on individuals wanting nothing more than to engage in civil commerce. You could magnify this impact by using some of your wealth to support organizations fighting to do this in other arenas. 
I'll list a few I personally donate monthly to (not a bitmillionaire so I pay these out of my regular salary) and if any of these sound appealing to you, I would encourage you to donate! 
* Electronic Frontier Foundation
* Wikileaks
* ACLU
* Libertarian Party
* Supporting a Tor node
* Drug Policy Alliance
* Erowid
* Law Enforcement Against Prohibition
* Marijuana Policy Project
Also, not sure about your political leanings, but if you happen to lean libertarian/classical liberal/minarchist I would really encourage you to get involved in your area's state/local politics. Relatively small amounts of money can change the entire course of an election at the state and local level, and you could be an amazing part of scaling back leviathan and creating an open economy where you live.

Echoing they will not care about your opinion.
I would stay away from talking charts or previous gains. The major rule in investing is "past performance is no indication of future performance", and most hedge funds consider themselves to be contrarians and want to be ahead of the curve. 
I would first talk to the [original white paper]( written by Satoshi. In my experience, people feel a lot more comfortable about something when there was clearly a lot of thought and research that went into the protocol to begin with. I would also cite some prominent cryptologists on how robust the protocol is.
After that, you would be well served to cover the other investment research out there right now. [Wedbush published some research]( as did [Bank of America](
So now you've covered the underlying protocol and what the major investment houses are currently saying, you might cite some of the [results from bitcoin black friday]( which point to bitcoins continued usage as a medium of exchange.
In a nutshell, my investment thesis behind bitcoin is:
* Offers the store of value of gold with a mathematically finite supply (how much gold is there in the world? how about the universe? what about asteroid mining? Gold has several issues most people just don't think about)
* More liquid than US dollars (can be moved around the planet instantly)
* Completely decentralized, no central point of failure ensures the network is indestructible (especially once we begin establishing nodes in space on satellites)
* Bitcoin has the largest user network and the most vibrant development community. Developments over the next year (libbitcoin, sx, hardware wallets, novel deployments, 3rd world adoption, etc.) will increase the utility of bitcoin as a means of exchange
Make sure you cover the downsides and current weaknesses though. If it's not measured, you won't be taken seriously.

Pay wall would be a large limit order. The bid/ask is basically what the market will bear if you want to buy or sell right now. You could also put in a limit order, say to sell 1,000 BTC at $1,000. 
This would probably create the 'wall' your talking about, whereby in order for the market price to go above $1,000 the above mentioned order will have to be filled or canceled by the person placing it. 
Options happen outside of the primary market, which is why they're called derivatives. I don't think there's much of a market right now for options due to the inherent volatility in BTC right now and the relatively low market cap.

For those of you that have pre-ordered large ASIC devices, what are your profitability expectations (if any?). Just curious.

Eh, you can if you want. In my opinion it really doesn't offer any benefit to Bitcoin, and most of the people involved with Litecoin are just looking to make money off of it. Granted, there's plenty of speculators in BTC and in a way I'm glad that the altcoins deflect some of that purely speculative capital, however I just see no reason why I should spend any of my Bitcoin to acquire Litecoin.
I would read [Erik Voorhees' thoughts on Litecoin]( before you move into any Litecoin position.

What we're seeing in altcoins is pretty common investor/speculator behavior when there's a new technology. People want to 'diversify' so they don't miss out on the next big thing, since it may not be apparent to them which will win. 
Just look at internet stocks circa 1998, 3D printing, solar, you name it. Most companies trade at a premium even though very few will make it big. 
I think Bitcoin will win. But it may take a while for the ecosystem around BTC to prove it is the way forward. 
Everyone needs to remember that they have a say in which altcoins live on. If you believe in BTC, then talk, tip and buy in BTC.

A little thing called variance. If all of the bets were of uniform size, the 1% house edge would have substantially manifested itself by now. 
But when you have large whales come in, their luck can substantially alter the returns. I remember seeing JD at +30% profit. To see the house edge return you need a long period of time and somewhat reasonable variance. 
Doog has it set up so that I think only 1% of the house stake can be won on a single bet, which limits the likelihood that the house could get ruined by variance. If he ever adds in a feature where investors can toggle their own risk and variance tolerance, one could see a more steady return from the house edge. You also wouldn't get the 'fuckit' returns though.

One post of this isn't enough? You've also been commenting all through the discussions on mBTC.

I think the ETF concern will work itself out. 
ETFs work for doing things that the average investor can't do on their own. I. e. cost effectively and with high amounts of liquidity replicate the S&amp;P 500, go long crude oil or short Japanese government bonds. 
In the short term, ETFs may be quite appealing to prospective BTC investors. With the infrastructure we have right now around Bitcoin, there are a lot of hurdles to acquiring it compared to clicking 'Buy 50 shares of BTC ETF' through your online brokerage. An ETF is also something that a lot of people already understand, which would probably help some to frame Bitcoin in a way that makes sense to them. 
The other thing ETFs allow for is short ETFs. So one could conceivably bet against the price of BTC easily over a stock exchange. This could greatly help to smooth out short-term bubbles. 
Once the Bitcoin infrastructure has been sufficiently built up and people are comfortable with using it, ETFs of BTC will make about as much sense as buying a USD ETF with USD. If you can spend Bitcoin on anything you'd want to purchase and it's secure, there's no point of securitizing it. 
**TL;DR** An ETF has great short-term benefits  and over the long term will likely become irrelevant for holding Bitcoin.

I've used the American version of Bitquick, and you don't really need a login, it just works off of your email and ticket number. You deposit cash in the sellers account and Bitquick releases the funds to you when you send a picture of the receipt. 
I wouldn't really call it an exchange, more of an escrow service for P2P sales.

What about wages though? In order for people's real earnings to stay constant wages have to increase by ~3% a year. In many industries and positions this has not happened. For the people living paycheck to paycheck, wages are the only thing that matters. 
If wages were paid in a 21M bitcoin scenario it would mean your salary would not have to change to maintain the same real purchasing power.

Before ASICs and before GPU mining, in Bitcoin there was CPU mining. Litecoin runs on scrypt, which was intended to rule out ASICs (seen as a downside of Bitcoin), but I would be shocked if we do not eventually see ASICs in the wild that can work with scrypt.
Even if you try and take it back to a human doing something, eventually someone will figure out a way to get a computer to do it, and then you're back to where we are with all of the other coins.

If true, it is very sad and unfortunate. In the end, DPR ended up violating the non-aggression principle he strongly advocated for. Philosophically he would have violated his vaunted principles. 
From a legal perspective, it's a very logical decision though. Just running that site would put you behind bars longer than many murder cases. So the marginal incremental jail time of murder could be mathematically justified if it keeps you out of prison.
It would not be morally right, but your desire to protect yourself may take over the voices telling you to do otherwise. Our criminal treatment of drug use and production actually encourages violence and murder, because if you've already broken the law that much, what's a few more years?

If you're setting your wage for the next year, you're more concerned with what expected inflation will be rather than realized inflation. 
Given most central banks have acknowledged they're willing to encounter higher inflation to support jobs growth, ~2-3% is a fairly conservative estimate of what the US Federal Reserve would like to see.

What kind of accounting do you do? If it's at all tax related, I think people have been talking a lot about tax on this sub but it's always good to have more experts.
I think my major question relates to whether you can get in trouble for a purchase made with bitcoins that appreciated in value.
So let's say you bought a $1,000 laptop with bitcoin, and you generally acquired your bitcoin for $10-30. Are you generally ok just making this purchase or should you be worried about capital gains implications?

You were able to conduct pseudonymous transactions on SR with Bitcoin. This intrinsic 'internet cash' capacity plus the network effect of other people accepting it is the intrinsic value of bitcoin. 
The fact that it also has a finite supply combined with the above mentioned factors makes it an appealing store of value.

Yeah, that's not really a fair statement. Coins like Litecoin work on a completely different Proof-of-Work system (scrypt), which is meant to make developing an ASIC miner much more difficult. So the hashrate levels for Bitcoin vs. Litecoin are not apples-to-apples. 
The best argument not to invest in the other cryptos is that Bitcoin has the best user network and the other currencies are all variations on the same revolutionary decentralization step that Bitcoin took. So you're basically getting into an imitator with the hopes that a rising tide raises all boats.

I always tip in denominations of internets ($0.25). A $0.25 tip is infinitely more valuable than an upvote (MSRP: $0.00), and the reaction has always been really positive. 
I've had at least one person say my $0.25 tip motivated them to finally read up on Bitcoin.
