Bitcoin had a 680% rise in the last year. I did not see a 680% increase in adoption. 
But I did see a 1000% increase in people buying it to trade to each other on exchanges.

While this thread is here, can someone please explain what happened today *without* painting it like some kind of corrupt, organized attack led by the evil villian? 
I can't dedicate my time to crypto news 24/7. Today, out of nowhere, I was spammed with notifications that several of my coins were down in the double digits. The price of BTC went down to $12,500...What happened?

Not viable unless you have access to over a hundred and know how to quickly deep scan or repair broken drives for both hardware side and software side (since most discarded ones that could potentially have something on them are either broken or wiped clean). Don't buy IDEs. Only SATAs. 
I've done this before. I spent money and found nothing. Ask how much you're willing to spend on chasing a fantasy before purchasing anything.

Yeah. They freezed trading and people who bought at that price were stuck. Then they doctored their charts to remove evidence of it happening

Most people are buying it with the hope that they can sell it to someone else for a higher price. If more people want bitcoin, the price will be higher. That's it. There's nothing else holding up the price.They aren't interested in the technology, just the price per coin and how much profit they can make. Welcome to the show.

Transact almost every day, you say? On what? Withdrawing from the exchange?
