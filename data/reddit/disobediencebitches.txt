Please elaborate. What conspiracy are you referring to? I was asking a question. If you don't like questions you have a problem.

Are you saying that satoshi would need this account in order to have the planned message delivered?
I doubt that very much.

Twitter, long time ago. Here's an article about it:

Hostility to a question isn't exactly a sign of feeling secure about ones views, is it now?
Anyway, I thought the message and the signature and hash were something like a timed message that could be decrypted by December 2019. 
Apparently not.

The Epstein investigation didn't kill itself either.

See? I already learned something. 
I didn't remember where this message came from and assumed it was from satoshis messages.
Apparently it isn't. It's from Twitter.
If you people would have just answered my question instead of foaming like mouth breathers you would be feeling much more relaxed. But that's your problem, luckily. Not mine.
For the future maybe consider questions as what they are: a search for information. 
Those who feel threatened by questions are scared of the truth.

No, I am straight. 
The information you have is wrong, where did you get it? While I think being gay and sucking dick is perfectly fine, it is not a choice, apparently. 
If it were I would consider it or at least try...
If you had any hope to get that kind of service from me I have to disappoint, sorry.
If I would provide such services, however, I wouldn't accept dogecoin, only BSV, BCH and BTC.
Hope that answers your question!
Have a nice day.

That would certainly be a nice move.

If you have a problem with a completely open ended QUESTION about something the creator of bitcoin has told us will happen in the coming month, then you likely have some kind of nefarious agenda and you are the one who should leave, my friend.
Those who hate questions are the most suspicious people who walk this earth...

It is rather scary how people here react to questions. 
By asking my question I already learned 2 things:
First: This wasn't one of satoshis undisputed communications, as I had assumed.
Second: Some people here get angry about questions, which is a very very bad sign.
Don't be afraid of questions! Give clarifying information or stfu. Questions are nothing to be afraid of, friends. If they scare you, you are doing something wrong...

This was the best answer by far, thank you.
I didn't remember where this message came from and assumed it was from satoshis messages.
Instead of just clarifying this like grown ups, some people here went completely wild.
Insecurity is a curse, damn.

He's just a guy that Gavin believes to be Satoshi.
Just a guy who doesn't want bitcoin to change and still pretend it's bitcoin (btc, bch).
Just a guy.
