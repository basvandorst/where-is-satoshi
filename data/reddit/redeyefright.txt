Have there been discussions on how to fix UTXO that you could point me to?  It sounds like throttling it is going to limit adoption if we are only the early adopters and its running into constraints.

So what's the best-case scenario?  I've not seen anyone show that lightning network doesn't, in your words, "sacrifice... trustlessness." If LN is the least-bad scenario, I could accept that, it just seems like the arguments people are making against block-size increases are applicable to LN as well, which makes it hard to understand for someone coming into this late.

Thanks, there's definitely some good references here for me to digest.

I'm not trying to insinuate anything with this question, I genuinely don't know if there is an answer to it, but my searching hasn't found an answer, and I think it would be helpful for other people to know as well.
If LN allows for near-free transactions, what prevents it from getting bogged down with spam?

Why won't it scale? Craig Wright (the guy claiming to be Satoshi) says with 256mb blocks, you could process 2x the transactions per second of Visa.
Obviously I know he's not liked here, but is his statement untrue? If it is true, it seems like scaling with big blocks works... maybe not in the most efficient manner (I'm not versed enough in the tech to appreciate minutia of details like that)... but it would still be one of several possible solutions.
The reason I'm against 2x at the moment is the way they came to a consensus without the users, but technically speaking, everything I've read seems to indicate bigger blocks does help the network. It seems like if we stay small blocks for the next 10 years, we're going to end up in a 2-coin system that acts like a savings account (bitcoin) and checking account (litecoin).  There's nothing inherently wrong with that I suppose, but it seems like the simpler the product, the faster we will get adoption.

He was saying if Moore's law continues, the machine required to process 256mb blocks would cost around $2k USD in 5 years, when that size of block would be needed. 5 years from now I imagine I could spare $2k for a node, but I get that may not be practical in underdeveloped regions... I'm not sure how much the latency would affect people in say the Congo from connecting to South Africa.
I totally get the argument against centralization. I need to do some additional reading on Lightning Networks, because I understood it to be like a state channel on Ethereum that would increase centralization more than having bigger blocks would.
*edit* Here's an example of what I have read that indicates LN would increase centralization of bitcoin.

Why does the size of the block affect the size of the ledger? In my simplistic way of understanding, I imagine each block as a hard drive. You can fit 10TB of data on 1 10TB drive, or span it over 2 5TB drives, the size of the drives don't affect the size of the data you want to store, just the number of drives (or blocks) it takes to store it.

Why are they mining bcash, did it have a difficulty adjustment, or are they trying to push through 2x?
