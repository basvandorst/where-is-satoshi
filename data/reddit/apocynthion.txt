Loans? That is what caused current issues. Some boomers wrote an article in the local newspaper here where they cried out that they were unable to sell their fucking 180m^2 house that they’d paid €18k for three decades ago, since then they had added tons of loans to pay for cars and vacations and would not turn a profit. There are many soon to be 30 millenials still living with their parents, or moving between sketchy short term rental contracts because of the fucked up housing market.
Fractional reserve lending needs to go, and the boomers should pick up the tab.

I would not be in bitcoin if I believed in Keynisean economics. But yes, you are right that I am not qualified to have an opinion about economics. Coming from a physics and mathematics background I can however say that modeling the performance of a dynamical system with positive Lyapunov exponent as a simple linear relationship is hogwash. 
I put my money where my mouth is, and in the half-decade I have owned Bitcoin it has been a very profitable decision.

The always online transaction processor can transmit an old version of the close TX at any time if the client is offline and get it accepted on the network. LN’s security model is on par with old school 0-conf, fine for small transactions but unacceptable for large transactions.

Which means that you need to provide a signature to your always online transaction handling service, just like a credit card? Wasn’t Bitcoin supposed to let us avoid using banks, not replacing them?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:15:18
The security problem arises when you need to trust your always online transaction service not to censor your transactions, as LN’s security model completely breaks if all clients are not always online.  
Most likely with LN users will not have their own wallet due to this problem. In this case the user will not have its own private key. LN is just a replacement for correspondent banking.

Which you cannot do directly with the birthday paradox anyway. There may however be indirect ways of stealing people's money with birthday paradox-generated collisions. 
E.g. you could create two differing documents, files or messages with the same MD5 hash using the birthday paradox. This in turn could create scenarios where it is possible to steal money. If a collision was ever found with ECDSA+RIPMED it would necessarily result in a switch from RIPMED to some other form of address generation. RIPMED is considered broken anyway. However, the added difficulty created by the de facto impossibleness of going from public key-&gt;private key makes ECDSA+RIPMED160 kind of secure. The question is for how long.

Great post! I think that we may have an opportunity here that extends far beyond bitcoin exchanges. These kinds of issues are not new in the banking industry. Hopefully the exchanges that actually win the customers trust and survives the test of time will have achieved levels of best practice, stability and transparency that we couldn't even have dreamt of with regular banking. If average Joe knew that his bank did not actually have his money maybe some of the financial woes in recent years could've been avoided.

One important aspect of Mike Hearn's (btw really interesting) talks is the trade network where highly commoditized products and services can be traded. This part is largely overlooked in this sub but is the enabling technology for the DAC's. The payment system used by the corporations is of less importance, given low friction, than the general purpose market. A good starting point for a trade net would be a decentralized altcoin exchange. Does anyone know if such a thing exists or is being developed?

Uhm no. If something is linear in logarithmic y-scale, that means it is growing exponentially.
y = Exp[At + B]
z = log y = log[ Exp(At + B)] = At + B
Plot t to z = log y and y is exponential and you'll get linear. Q.E.D.
You shouldn't have skipped math in high school.
TL;DR The number of bitcoin transactions is indeed growing exponentially and people are fuckwits when it comes to math.

It can also be assumed that the total number of transactions in the world will increase dramatically over the next few decades due to people, in general, becoming more wealthy. Distributed autonomous corporations will also cause the number of transactions to increase even more. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:04:25
You must have misunderstood my question. We are talking about the birthday paradox. The complexity is thus the square root of the number of possible addresses, i.e. Sqrt(2^160) = 2^80 which could be theoretically doable with today's resources given that you have access to a huge cluster and a lot of time.
Yes, you are right. Given a similar transaction count as MasterCard at 51*10^6 transactions per day it would take 7 * 10^28 years until the probability of drawing a used address is below one in a billion and 6 * 10^13 years to have a probability of 2^-80 (an estimate of the current brute force limit).

Uhm, no. Bell's Inequality states that it is impossible to create any form of machine obeying the rules of locality that can proper explain quantum theory. Locality means that two points cannot communicate faster than light. In layman's terms this means that classical physics cannot possibly explain quantum phenomena.

What does the article mean with "bitWallet cannot sweep private keys"?
It is possible to import private keys in bitWallet and it is also possible to transmit all unspent transactions to a new address. Isn't this the usual definition of sweeping private keys? It isn't done automatically though, but as a power user I actually prefer this system.

Someone with a Master's degree in Mathematics may disagree with your use of the term "crushing the vertical scale" when it is obvious that he is using log(y) scale.

Yes. Of course. Especially since Intel is the exact opposite to a monopoly and is thus a really bad example of the market forces killing bloated and bad actors.

This is not a problem. Even with a shitty 2G EDGE connection you can get ~7 kB/s in upload speed. That speed is sufficient to transmit transactions with a huge number of inputs and outputs in mere seconds.
Edit: A text message via the SMS protocol is able to send 160 bytes and the minimal bitcoin transaction is 166 bytes. Text messages are therefore unsuitable for transaction transmission.
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:32:13
This would not affect all blocks even if we got a factor two increase of the block size. The average time for a confirmation would increase a bit but nothing more serious. Also if the average block size comes close to the maximal block size it will be increased. The entire purpose of it is to make confirmations a scarce resource which somewhat mitigates the tragedy of the commons. The best thing to hope for is that miners prioritize the transactions with high fees which increases the incentive of mining.
Edit: I although see a problem with the rate of how new difficulties are determined, i.e. once every 2016(?) or something blocks. This limit makes the network significantly slower to react on a decrease in hash rate than an increase. This is although somewhat by design because a rapid increase is of more concern because of the 51% attack.

If an attacker has close to half or more of the total hashing power in the network, it could with some luck keep two braches of the block chain alive at the same time. If one of these branches did not contain any transactions it would effectively stop the majority of all transactions on the network.
An attacker would in this scenario greedily mine empty blocks for some time without submitting them to the network. When some period of time has passed it would release its (now longer) version of the blockchain into the network thus voiding all transactions made during that period of time. This is allowed because the longest blockchain is always the valid one. 
Edit: Cracking the cryptographic standards used by Bitcoin is really hard and can for all intents and purposes be considered impossible.
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:05:54
That is implied, yes, but it must be done. Who wants to use a currency which cannot be used for ordinary sized purchases? If the 1MB limit stays that will effectively cap the growth of Bitcoin and possibly kill it in favor of some alt-coin that does not have this artificial limit.

The CA will do that for you. Self-signed certificates should be a major warning sign. I do not, however, think that the MITM used SSL as that would create large warning messages on most modern internet browsers. It is much more likely that the MITM set up a regular HTTP connection to the user and then a HTTPS connection to Blockchain while extracting data and acting as a HTTP&lt;-&gt;HTTPS proxy.
Pro tip: Never use an utrusted tunnel to send important information if you do not MAKE SURE SSL is used and that the CA has approved the certificate.

You wouldn't even start doing that due to the cost. Intel has such an incredible amount of in house competence which would take decades to rebuild. I don't even think that any newcomer would be able to create a fully working copy of one of Intel's newest high end processors, let alone out compete Intel on its home field.
 
Besides Intel and their desktop and server architectures, technological progress continues. What happens, e.g. when mobile or cellphone processors achieve comparable performance to desktop architectures, especially if let's say Intel (hypothetically) was badly run? Suddenly Intel may be disrupted by the low-end-shit-processor manufacturer which it didn't even bother to compete with in the first place due to Intel's couchy position as market leader.
The new company does not even have to make comparable processors. It is enough if the new processor eats into Intel's sales by people buying tablet computers or maybe fancy HMDs instead of desktop computers.

Exponential is the standard way of analyzing financial time series. Change in percent is nonsensical in linear scale. (Or, rather, it makes a neat exponential curve in lin space which surprise surprise is linear in log-space) By using a linear regression in log space he is calculating the (geometrically) average percentage change.
Also, you ALWAYS use logarithmic scale when considering time series with order-of-magnitude differences.

2G as in GSM/GPRS/EDGE is the oldest cellular communication standard in use around the world, and it was with the release of GSM that SMS was introduced. The upload speed of 7 kB/s is therefore a reasonable guess regarding the worst case performance in all worldwide cellular networks. 
MMS was introduced with the third generation cellular standard W-CDMA which means that there are a lot of people which still don't have access to MMS and 3G upload speeds.

E.g. a sudden drop in hash rate by 50% would result in double the time between blocks and thus double the amount of transactions per block. Even if the drop was 90% it would only result in ten times more transactions per block. That does not seem to be a big issue in my opinion. Also the network will regulate itself.

Can you do anything fun with address collisions?
It is impossible to create a collision with a specific address but could theoretically be doable to find two private keys corresponding to the same address. Wouldn't these keys be the same for all intents and purposes?
Edit: I just had an interesting but slightly unrelated thought. The total money supply will slowly diffuse into more and more addresses as time goes by. Because of the transaction fee, many people will lose a few satoshis here and there because messing up change addresses thus getting balances too low to extract without losing money. If a large fraction of all addresses contain minuscule amounts of dust it may become relatively probable to draw an address at random containing a non-zero balance.

The answer is actually a bit trickier than the "long answer" and it all depends on the material, the length of the induced currents, the frequency of the electromagnetic waves and so forth. A standard microwave oven runs on approximately the same frequency as a cell phone and is constructed as a Faraday cage to block the radiation from going out.

Any basic cellphone with packet service (i.e. atleast GPRS) can be used for signing Bitcoin transactions. A Nokia 3330 from 2001 would be capable of doing this. The bigger issue is payment verification. It is not realistic to run a full node on a smartphone, but a SPV wallet should be able to run on almost any GPRS compatible cellphone.
Otherwise, there is an alternative of using a trusted third party and in that case a single text message would be sufficient to send and receive funds.

Thank you for the link to a truely thought provoking article. 
I, however, don't agree with its main point due to the recent correlation between inflation and financial booming. Although, I agree with its point that economic cycles are hard to control by setting the interest rates. In my native Sweden, the Swedish fed, "riksbanken", is having a hard time keeping any inflation at all, let alone 2%.  I see the same pattern throughout the European economies.

Yes, that's right. Someone has to find a correct hash. Assuming that each hash has the same probability of verifying the block, the expected number of hashes to try should be the same (given a constant difficulty) no matter how many miners there are. Less miners although means less overhead time and less chance of being orphaned. This means that the expected profit per tried hash will go up for all miners that remain after some have turned their rigs off. Less miners competing for the block reward is good for the miners but bad for the users.

@_date: 2014-10-04 09:11:58
Of course you wouldn't include them in transactions! That would be moronic! For birthday attacks you do something akin to this:
    Initialize empty sets for addresses and private keys.
    
    While all addresses in set are unique:
        
        Draw random private key.
        Calculate address from private key
        Check if address exists in address set, if so, abort
        Update address and private key sets
There are efficient ways of compressing ordered data. Still, we are talking about a huuuuge cluster. Larger than most companies have. Storage would not be the limiting factor. I would be more concerned about network usage.

Please read my answer to the OP a couple of posts up. :)
Basically, a monopoly can charge just about whatever they want for its product. If any other company were to compete with the monopoly it could underprice it. Big companies, especially monopolies, have a hard time adapting to changing market landscapes and can thus be easily outcompeted. 
If you really are interested, there exist a number of rather recent examples of what happens to such companies in free markets. One such example is the previous phone monopoly in Sweden, now called Telia. When the market was deregulated a lot of other companies entered the market and took large parts of its previous market share. Telia still exist today but it did not retain its monopoly and it has had a number of bad years.

You assume two things that may or may not be erroneous. The first of these being that the monopoly will keep innovating to invent new products and keep prices down. Secondly you assume that the monopoly will be able to shift its purpose if and when its product becomes disrupted. Private companies in free markets are having a hard time achieving many of these qualities.
I guess if a monopoly successfully accomplishes them all it would be a pretty nice company. We could let it take over our entire society and cut governmental spending in half overnight.

I guess we will see when the first serious crash in hash rate happens. In the meantime we can try to calculate what would happen (I'm sorry if you don't have a background in statistics but I'll try to be as clear as possible)
We can model the time it takes to get a confirmation of a block as something called an exponential distribution. This is the same distribution used for calculating time between two consecutive radioactive decays. Denote the probability for one miner to find a confirmation in 10 minutes as x_i for all miners 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n where n is the total number of miners. The total block rate is then x = sum x_i and the time it takes is given by the exponential distribution.
The probability that a specific miner i wins a block is then:
p_i = x_i/x = x_i/(sum x_i)
Now consider what will happen if some miners turn off their rigs. The block rate of the network will go down but the probability that a specific miner will win the block reward increases. It is also so that the average time until a miner wins a block reward will go down even though the block rate increases. Now add increased transaction fees and you see that the expected profit will go up.
Average profit per block= p_i * average block reward
TL;DR If some miners turn off their rigs, other miners will have higher probability of winning the block reward. This in combination with increased transaction fees will increase the profitability. I'm sorry for any spelling errors. I'm writing with my phone.

Yes and no. The market would compensate by forcing the bitcoin exchange rate to differ between exchanges. This would also have the nasty side effect of offering an arbitrage opportunity, thus amplifying the problem and leading to a de facto bank run. I guess that in the MtGox case, the bitcoin exchange rate was inflated across all exchanges because of arbitrage leading to an asymmetry between MtGox's USD and BTC reserves. Halting USD withdrawals further amplified the BTC price leading to the inevitable goxxing.
TL;DR Fractional reserve banking on a highly volatile forex is a really bad idea.

@_date: 2014-10-03 20:50:06
Yes, that was my question. :)
Because the public key and the signature are included in a transaction on the input side but not on the output side it should be possible for both private keys to spend the outputs associated with the address generated by the private keys. I.e. the private keys are equivalent.
The address can safely be assumed to be empty upon finding it and I do not see if it is possible to exploit having two different private keys being able to spend the same outputs.

In the same way the US government is backing the dollar, the mining collective is backing the bitcoin. The exchange rates are determined by the free market for both bitcoin and the dollar. The dollar just happens to have a larger userbase which gives it higher stability in terms of exchange rate.

A hard fork is definitely not a non-issue. It needs to be carefully implemented so that the majority if the network has time to upgrade before the change is actualized. The reason behind why the limit hasn't been changed yet is that it currently does not limit the number of transactions. Also, such an upgrade would be a good time to implement other changes to the blockchain to optimize its storage requirements. 
Today the maximum block size limit is of little importance more than to inhibit the confirmation of ridiculously large blocks.

We actually do know what happens if an exchange runs on a fractional reserve, which was the case with MtGox.

I agree with you on this. Excessive use of credit as some form of artificial rental market has created big hurdles both in the worlds economies and in politics. This is the unfortunate and unavoidable effect of inflation. Deflation would solve many of the problems we are seeing. Governments should not meddle in affairs they do not understand. Regulating the cyclic nature of economy with the limited methods governments have at there disposal is like changing the direction of a storm by blowing at it.
It is not clear to me what would happen if we switched back to e.g. a gold standard. This would not necessarily be good for the economy. A gradual switch to some other, more stable, form of currency could be a much better way of approaching it. Bitcoin or a similar crypto currency could possibly accomplish this and that is one of the main reasons why I believe in Bitcoin. The economy wants to be free.

That is not right. It is the output's redeemScript which determines how it can be spent. Only spending outputs from Segwit addresses will have lower fees.


It is easier to understand by first remembering that Segwit has been implemented as a soft fork. Any transaction that can be spent with witness data in the discounted block space must be anyone-can-spend as seen from legacy clients, otherwise these clients would see the transaction as invalid and cause a hard fork.
Any Segwit user must create a Segwit address and send funds to it, before being able to send Segwit transactions.

That is not an adequate answer. I am on mobile and am able to answer with this:


Install a SegWit-supporting wallet.
Receive money on new SegWit addresses, which start with 3. You must generate new addresses; your old addresses will never be SegWit addresses. Note that not all addresses starting with 3 are SegWit addresses, and it is impossible to tell just from looking at an address whether it is a SegWit address.
Whenever you spend BTC which you have received via SegWit addresses, you will receive the SegWit discount. If you send a transaction spending some BTC received via non-SegWit addresses and some BTC received via SegWit addresses, you will receive a partial discount. The destination address doesn't matter.

Have I stated that *everyone* was using it? No. What I stated is that there existed enough users so it was worthwhile for some business to accept bitcoin, even as 0-conf. There was even payment processors such as Bitpay who if I remember correctly accepted 0-conf up until maybe a year is so ago.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:12:44
I used to use it. There’s no better feeling then buying a beer with bitcoin!
Yes, it was technically possible to double spend 0-conf transactions before removing the first seen rule, and full blocks. The cost of performing such an attack for buying a coffee or beer is however high, and with the additional risk of getting your ass kicked by an angry bouncer. Instead of parroting “0-conf was never secure”, couldn’t we instead have improved transaction propagation? Fraud proofs could also be a used. What if upon receiving a double spend, a node will propagate both transactions to the network making both invalid. Further transactions involving the same outputs are then ignored for the duration of a freeze time.

@_date: 2017-11-19 11:39:03
Do you really think that there is such data for bitcoin? Seriously!
No, that is not enough. Just transmitting your tx to two different nodes in different parts of the network is very easy to detect if you monitor TX propagation, which any serious payment processor should do. Fees are not relevant under first-seen-rule. The only two ways of defrauding a merchant with 0-conf is by either releasing your transaction to a malicious miner which does not follow first-seen-rule, or by spamming the network and thus getting the transaction expiring in the mempool. Before full blocks and RBF, these two attacks were both prohibitly expensive.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:27:18
That’s bullshit. People were using it.
No you could not. Double spending 0-conf was very difficult assuming that the attacker did not have access to a significant percentage of hash power. A merchant can just monitor the network for double spends and reject the transaction if a double spend is detected before the tx has propagated the network.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:15:26

Segwit should absolutely not be dismissed because of that. I am just saying that Segwit is not a good way to increase block size. It although is a good solution for malleability, quadratic hashing, UTXO bloat, and future protocol upgrades. But please do not tout it as a solution to short term scaling. 
One simple suggestion would be to also discount the non witness data of Segwit transactions, to create an effective blocksize increase. Of course this would result in a hardfork, but it seems like a hardfork will be required sooner or later anyway. Even with LN, on-chain scaling is required. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:59:36
Obviously. The result is the same though.
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:12:55
But why only discount the witness data, and not all data? Couldn't you even encourage people to use SegWit transactions by saying that 3/4 of the total block space is reserved for SegWit transactions, ensuring better scalability properties of the extended blocksize. Future blocksize increases could be done in this extended area, and the space for legacy transactions could be decreased over time. Wouldn't this also be a nice way of phasing out old inefficient transaction formats? I guess that something like this is the point with discounting witness data, but why not go all the way and make legacy transactions' and SegWit transactions' block space utilization fully orthogonal?
Yes, I know that this would be a hardfork as older nodes would be unable to see the new transactions, but with enough node and miner support this should be essentially safe, right?
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:27:20

And you do that by mining blocks which signal Segwit, not by throwing a tantrum.
The entire idea with bitcoin is that a minority chain will never catch up to the majority chain due to the economic incentives for miners. If this premise is false, we have much bigger problems than with scalability and politics, because it would mean that the white paper  is falsified and that proof of work does not work.

@_date: 2017-05-19 13:59:32
It all depends on what you define as "using bitcoin". Is it running a full node, or is it hodling bitcoin, or sending bitcoin transactions, or maybe a combination of the above?
For a person who defines "using bitcoin" as being able to own and transact the tokens, running a fully verifying node is not important. But if you define using bitcoin as running bitcoind, then it is essential. Gavin seems to use the first definition.

What is to say that the number of transactions will grow faster than the additional block space given by Segwit?

The point with a softfork is that the fully verifying nodes can follow the post fork chain without upgrading, although without being able to verify the chain. A hardfork requires all full nodes to be updated to be able to follow the post fork chain. 
SPV wallets is a different story, which is more dependent on transaction formats than block serialization.

You cannot chose to just accept the Segwit blocks without accepting the non-Segwit blocks. The end result is that you fork yourself off the network being unable to see either. Any chain that contains a single non-Segwit block will be completely invisible to your node.

I mostly agree. Rallying the support for a hardfork will be close to impossible, as getting even 50% support for Segwit seems to be impossible. The consensus rules of Bitcoin seem to be mostly immutable at this stage.

No, if you spend a P2PKH output, you need to include the witness data in the non-discounted block space. It is the transaction which you are trying to spend that dictates how it can be spent.

No, a big Ethereum would definitely not help us. If crypto goes in the direction of ether, then I for one will be totally uninterested. Me and many like me are in Bitcoin because of ideological reasons, and not for monetary reasons. The fixed supply and decentralized nature of Bitcoin are the two things that are the most interesting to me. Ethereum has neither.

Yes, I think most people buying bitcoin have had to see the value of their coins being significantly less than the invested amount.

The banks cannot lend bitcoin with a fractional reserve. Their entire business model is doomed if crypto becomes mainstream.

The one with libertarian ideology definitely. There is no need for crypto within mainstream ideology. If you can accept some level of trust there are transaction databases far more efficient than crypto.

So taking out your credit card, inserting it into a machine and pressing your PIN and "Confirm" is harder? The easiest method of paying with bitcoin is in my opinion using a smartphone app. You however still need to install and configure the application and transfer funds. This is a big hurdle, especially for older people.
I definitely believe that crypto currency is the future. The current state of Bitcoin together with certain design choices like using a central ledger could although slow mainstream adaptation and acceptance.

It is more the case of putting my money where my mouth is. My exit criteria are based on Bitcoin's properties rather than price. Purchasing more coins is not an option for me until the scaling civil war has been resolved.
