I honestly think that in turn, the right wing overreach should be kept in check more in America. Would you agree?

Doctors still get paid under universal healthcare. The cost of one medical procedure is split amongst the entire population, that way if one person happens to become sick (which can happen to anyone) they don't have to pay all of it on their own.
You could also choose to adopt the Dutch healthcare system, which is a little more right than universal healthcare in the UK.
The Dutch system works like this: everybody has a monthly cost of health insurance and they have a deductible. They can balance the cost of these how they see fit themselves to a certain extent. 
If you're young and you don't think you'll get sick you go for a high deductible (maxed at about $1000) and low monthly costs (minimum of $100).
If you're old and you think you'll probably need to see a specialist doctor like a surgeon, you'd go for a low deductible (at least $400) and high monthly costs (maximum of $125)
There are multiple insurers so the price between insurers differs and sometimes you get a better price with one insurer than the other because of the relatively  free market.
Children under 18 are insured for free with their parents and get full benefits. Visits to the family doctor or g.p. do not count towards your deductible and people are therefore not discouraged to go to the doctor.
I honestly would prefer a more socialist system, however I do think this is a pretty good compromise between left and right.

No, it considers it a financial asset, much like stocks
