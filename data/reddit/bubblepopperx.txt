Bcore POW change chain is not Bitcoin, it's another altcoin. :)

Oh. you can find a better answer in your favourite position [here](
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:01:45
The terminology of nodes is confusing. How can a node which does not extend the chain as it does not do proof of work ensure the network is honest and decentralized.? 
All they can do is decide what they themselves consider as true or not but can't affect the rest of the network?
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:49:01
Is that the professor who says "Bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control (optional)" and considers transactions as spam.? :)

well, coinbase buys those BTC and in turn sell it to people. 
They don't keep it for themselves. I do think most of these people that buy from conbase send the BTC to SPV clients or hardware wallets, not full nodes. So coinbase or any exchanges full nodes are economically significant (as far as miners are concerned) than nodes for which they can't observe any economic activity.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:45:43
Nice one

Hello Trump Jr.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:00:38
Oh I thought you either had insight on the different kinds of users who buy of exchanges, institutional investors etc. or trying to judge what users would want based on this restricted bitcoin users forum.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:17:54
That is core's opinion. But do not conflate core's stance and all of us bitcoin users. Literally, all the purchases I have done with bitcoin has been through Bitpay. They have been very reliable. I would follow their instructions. If major exchanges like coinbase, kraken follow the higher hashpower valid 2x chain (as per the whitepaper) then I would call that bitcoin and will proceed to use it. Do not use the users of the forum as representative of the entire bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:39:44
yes, but not all nodes are equal. Some merely signal intent. Nodes without mining power and/or no economic activity i.e no wallets associated with it are poor signals of intent as anyone can easily spoof them without having skin in the game. For example a government actor can easily spun nodes announce consensus exists for their rules.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:35:06
yes, I understand that. to my original point, the nodes are hardly enforcing or policing anything for the network ... they are more of just validating what they want to buy for themselves. It's like going to a market of blocks and picking what they consider as valid. At best they are signalling intent to block sellers .. but hardly enforcing anything.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:17:16
I think that belittles Satoshi's synergy of different ideas. Satoshi also thought of the various incentive model, how this system would displace fiat etc.. simplifying it like that somehow appears rude.. like calling an aeroplane, just a  bird with metal wings.. not wrong .. but still.
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:47:15
They can sell whatever they want under whatever moniker they want. They might even list the old chain as Bitcoin Core so users better understand what they are buying. Monikers like bitcoin are not decided by a central reddit community.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:35:24
did they come up with the solution or were scratching their beards? A complete solution once presented appears trivial to others, nevertheless, it takes an effort a synthesize an idea even from existing ideas.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:21:49
btc1 will have more than sufficient nodes. As exchanges will recognize the 2x chain as Bitcoin and will spun nodes. Many of them are already testing the btc1 client.
Users with significant volumes of bitcoin/transactions will also run the btc1 client to make sure they stay on the right chain and not get stuck with infinitely slow core chain.

and voila, we have reinvented paypal.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:18:56
if there is no planned difficulty change, the 1x miners who want to continue mining the 1+ chain will mine at a loss due to the steep difficulty. If there was a planned difficulty change then it must be reassuring for them.
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:20:52
so a node run by coinbase who buy tons of btc is more important than nodes that buy quarter btc every year?
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:25:45
but if the cypherpunks spin more nodes, they can save the 10% hashpower chain?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:23:37
Why won't bitpay offer their own payment channels?

Do we have a hat design yet? I propose

@_date: 2017-08-09 07:38:30
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:25:19
I think that would mean they incur a loss as the equipment lies idle or underutilized. Not sure it is a safe strategy. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:40:30
you are welcome to stay with core x.y.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:23:03
yeah just prefix everything you don't agree with as Bitmain, Jihad and put what you agree with on hats. The world was stop turning.

There you go 
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:02:23
you will continue using dinkycoin. Not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:20:23
where did they claim they do not support 2x. dim witted FUD.
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:22:09
once the core chain changes POW and forks off, bitcoin will continue to function as normal.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:33:41
are they developing an alternative to payment channels? I just think if payment channels are efficient it makes business sense to run them.
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:39:36


Not everyone is willing to run 1x code come November.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:26:41
got it. That means, as long as there is even a single node that accepts a mined block then that is considered valid?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:19:38
An incumbent also need to prove why they should continue to claim the bitcoin moniker when majority of the hashpower and users move away.

@_date: 2017-08-10 06:51:45
Why tho? Because you say so? Bitcoin need not be a settlement currency, and all the pioneers agreed that the role of settlement currency was better executed by another technology. That may not even be Lightning for all we know.
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:39:55
I was merely pointing out non-mining nodes are not "policing" or "enforcing" anything on the network...they merely signal intent and ensure the validity of their own chain they follow. Maybe they relay feature affects the network but I am not sure if the network halts because of that as long as other nodes relay those blocks.   
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:27:13
This way &lt;------------- Difficulty/POW change alt exit 
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:50:12
people buy a service rather than hardware which requires upkeep, as it is so easy to stop, extend the service than dealing with hardware. For a business, the service cost is far minimal compared to dealing with hardware.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:06:30
well if there is even 1 another node that considers the block to be valid then they can keep relaying with similar nodes? It is possible then the network can have 2 partitions, one that accepts blocks (possibly modified) as valid while the other set does not. As long as the mined blocks are accepted by even a few nodes, then the enforcement has failed. so lets say an node run by an exchange accepts these blocks and users are willing to pay for those, it doesn't matter that some nodes ban them. isn't it?
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:04:38
how long will it take to ride out the hashpower drop on the legacy chain? yes, it would be better if a POW/difficulty change is coded and ready to go in core.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:21:48
no you are not obliged is the correct answer, but you might be in the minority calling your chain Bitcoin after that.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:25:41
ok mate.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:32:11
we need the fee market back.
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:45:32
wait which one are you calling bitcoin? the one with the most hashpower or the one which will have to do a difficulty change hardfork?
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:48:02
all good.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:08:53
is it possible the LN nodes might be subject to money transmitter licenses etc. as now you are now just doing your own transactions but potentially settling someone else's?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:18:39
by the community you mean this forum? which excludes users who have differing opinions thereby creating a hivemind?
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:05:05
how does the enforcement part of nodes work? Does it halt all transaction broadcasting?
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:30:31


Let's hope so.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:56:05


I may not want to exchange any value with "you" for your "coin". But I will be exchanging bitcoins for value with the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:39:06
Maybe we need a KYC, analytics and a mandatory registration for transaction broadcasters, to ensure appropriate use of the network?
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:16:48
but you like Earth-is-the-centre-of-the-universers? ROFL.
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:44:09
is that the same block core developers plan to code the difficulty reduce hardfork?
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:03:20
precisely, and the market has moved your cheese.
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:01:13
You run the Trump-coin node client. I'll just continue using bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-13 16:29:44


That is exactly what I was thinking of. LN nodes might eventually be offered as professional services and they might have a lot more legal obligation(s).
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:37:49
full nodes meaning mining nodes?
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:04:02
1. Core - 0.14.2
2. Btc1 - 1.14.5
No plan to migrate to 0.15, need a version of the core that merges the S2X changes or implements their own version.

@_date: 2017-08-16 20:32:53
Well users could also sue them if they sold a core chain with &lt;10% hashpower and infinite transaction time as bitcoin.
unless of course core is ready with a difficulty or POW change hardfork.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:36:52
Not for individual users, but exchanges can measure user support I guess. They can gather quite a lot of metrics and insight into their user behaviour. And I do think some of them track user behaviour after purchase. Like if the bitcoins that are bought are sitting in cold storage or being used to purchase using enables like bitpay etc. Bitpay could probably know what kind of wallets users are using (for some cases) SPV or full node.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:10:55


If it is only 8 weeks, it might be manageable yes.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:33:11
people who can want to run lightning hubs will be a even smaller percentage of people who want to run full nodes.
Bitpay could easily sell service as a lightning hub if demand exists.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:14:19
Yeah sure dude, whatever. Do you get paid for this? So sad.
