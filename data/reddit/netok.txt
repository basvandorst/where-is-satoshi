Did you swap the cause and result? Increase of cost of mining does not increase the price. It is the other way round. When the price increases, the monetary incentive of mining increase, more investment goes into mining, thus mining becomes more expensive. And thus, your no.1 reason is invalid.

You didnt add anything new in this comment. 
You are thinking Bitcoin as products like GPU or TV, when actually it is more like commodity like oil and gold.

I see. I was asking the question because the picture in OP says"A new address is created in Gary's wallet with ... bitcoin". So I guess the picture is wrong? What really happens is you input your address when you are mining, and when you mined the block there will be tx for the reward and from others' tx fees? Who is the sender of the reward?

Can someone explain how the mining reward works? How is the reward wallet created?  How does Gary take the private key? What does the transaction look like? From who?

Any decent programmer can make that in 2 hours(probably shorter).
