Oh wait a second, I actually realize that I did export this private key back in late 2015/early 2016 and it definitely was compromised. That explains how the money was stolen, thanks.
What's really strange though is that this was the default receive address when I clicked the receive tab, even though I used it before. That transaction is actually the first transaction in this wallet's history.
I don't know why there's two receives to this address. In fact, when I went to the receive tab *just now* that same address is **still** the default receive address.

Already ahead of ya. I moved it into a paper wallet I had lying around.


Yes, but with an "old" seed.


No. I launched TAILS, loaded up the seed directly, and transferred to the "receive" address.


Android wallet for blackberry. I'm confident that's not the issue, because the funds confirmed inside my electrum wallet before being stolen.

Bingo, that's exactly what I do!

I've linked more information in the additional details section.

It was generated by electrum. Check out the screenshot I posted.

First used in late 2015.

Done! Thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:37:17
Nope, that address is in my electrum wallet.
Thanks for your help though!
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:39:08
Yeah, that's what I mean.
