My advice would be to do a little research so you know what you might be looking for.  Take a look at what addresses and private keys look like also what seeds look like.  After you are familiar with those you might recognize them amongst his notes.  The other thing would be to see if you can find someone that you trust that understands bitcoin.  Maybe post to Facebook and see if someone you are friends with uses bitcoin and could help you look through notes.
I would also look at the bank account to see what exchange the coins we're purchased through.  He could have left them on the exchange.  Once you know where money was transferred to see if you can get access to the account at that exchange with his email address and password.

I had a transaction returned to Coinbase and they did manually credit the amount back to me.  I wouldn't worry about it, as said before they may be a little slow but they are a legit business.

That looks like the drive caddy gaming laptops would use for two drives in a raid 0.  Given that you had the usable space of both drives it was almost certinaly a raid 0 array.  In that case the only way to get the data off the drives is to connect them to a motherboard/raid card that uses the same raid controller and configure them in a raid 0 again.  Occasionally a different raid controller would recognize them but that's kind of a crapshoot.  Depending on how much is in that wallet I would recommend getting the exact same model laptop and putting them in it.  If there's a large enough amount you might want to consult with a local IT guy to avoid the risk of corrupting the data.

Looks like over an hour since the last block.  I'd relax, this I imagine it'll be a couple blocks before you receive it.
