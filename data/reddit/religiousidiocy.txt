I'd say you just failed to answer a straight question. 
I actually understand what the graphs say. I have two degrees in science, I'm published.
These graphs are completely meaningless and useless though. Your probabilities are all over the place, the distributions are so huge, almost any price fits it. 
And the current BTC price shows just how useless these charts are.  For one-day chart we're all the way on the left, where your probabilities are near zero.
You see, I just presented actual arguments, when you failed to answer a straight question and instead went for an ad hominem attack.

From what you wrote, it looks like you don't understand retirement. Let's disassemble your argument.


Wow. Really? You conveniently omitted what you invest them into.


Then you have to make +3% + inflation + taxes just to break even.
What investment would that be?


Yeah, unless you're retiring in some shithole, that's not much at all.
That wouldn't barely cover good health insurance in the US. Oh, and if you do get sick, even with this "good" insurance, you will still get fucked financially.


Well, if you're going to argue "living frugally", homeless people are all happily retired.

Bitcoins are not under anybody's name. They are stored in wallets. Anybody who has the private key can access that wallet. 
If there's something only your newborn niece knows (and will know when she grows up), you can use it as a password to encrypt the wallet. Doubt there's such a piece of knowledge though.

Just like there are multiple fiat currencies, there will be multiple coexisting cryptocurrencies. Competition is good. It's not our goal to make Bitcoin the only player. All the altocoins are just fine, any of them succeeding is a nail in the coffin of the current rotten system.
Plus Bitcoin in its current state can't possibly handle the amount of transactions happening globally, we will need other currencies.

How are you going to "hack" and transfer $5-6 million dollars without a trace? 
Maybe if it's in cash, but so much cash is a pain in the ass to deal with in the first place, and then you'd have to stage robbery of some kind.

"they can get all those merchants accept BTC"
How do you force one of the biggest retailers in the world accept anything? You have to realize that these huge retailers have more power than any politician or a subset of politicians. They can completely replace the government with the people they like using lobbying, and it's not even that much money at their scale.

@_date: 2013-11-21 00:25:48


Yeah, because there are easy ways to get money out of BTC. Like for cash.


You don't understand what they mean by "trackable". They mean you can trace the transactions, but all transactions eventually spread so much, you can't tell what's what. 
Once stolen BTC gets mixed with other money, it's untrackable.
Imagine wallets A, B , F , X , Z  (where A is the stolen money, B is clean money).
    Send 1 BTC A-&gt;F
    Send 1 BTC B-&gt;F
    Send 0.5 BTC F-&gt;X
    Send 1.5 BTC F-&gt;Z
Now is the money in X dirty? No way to know. No way to prove.

And also, wouldn't you know the name of the person who wired you the money?
You make a second LocalBitcoin account, pretend you want to buy from him, ask for photo ID. If the name matches the name of the wire, you have proof of fraud. Just don't announce that you caught the guy, start with involving the police.

If the price of BTC would stop at its current level and stay there forever, I'm absolutely cool with it. We will have a wonderful, stable way of transferring money without the involvement of any shitty financial institutions that add their fees on everything.
But since so many people want BTC, its price keeps going up. That shows you the true value and how sick people are with the banks and the credit card companies.
So in short, fuck the price, we need more people using and accepting it, that's where the real usefulness is.

I really don't care if you personally join.
I will however say a couple things that struck me over the years about bitcoin, since you insist:
1) It's a new thing, unlike any other, it has many great properties that people seem to like and want. It solves big problems. It's like the Internet 30-40 years ago. In my mind it's the next big thing.
2) You know lotteries - every mathematically knowledgeable person understands that you can't really win the jackpot, it's so unlikely. Bitcoin is the lottery that you *can* win. I invested as much as I was willing to lose. If I lose, it's not a big deal. If I win, I win pretty big. And my odds are not that bad, way better than millions to one.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:04:37
Yup, you are correct
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:27:58
I was thinking of doing this. It's probably not too hard, just a ton of data to process. That graph would be pretty huge - there are probably millions of wallets each with multiple receiving addresses, and even more transactions (the edges of the graph).
Then you will have to constantly update the graph.
Limiting to a random sample of 100,000 doesn't seem useful at all.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:03:27
If BTC becomes mainstream at the level of any major currency such as EUR or USD (which values are  €840 billion and $1.22 trillion respectively), and there are 21 million BTC total, then each BTC would be valued at around $58,000.
The only way BTC would reach 100K and higher if it becomes the dominant global currency. It is a possibility, but I wouldn't bet my money on it.

The classic way is to mix the money.
Imagine wallets A,B,F,X,Z.
A contains your money.
B contains somebody else's money.
Move the money as follows, 1BTC in each transaction:
    A -&gt; F
    B -&gt; F
    F -&gt; X
    F -&gt; Z
Now you have 1BTC in X and in Z, but there's absolutely no way of telling where they came from. All you can say is they came from F. From now on X and Z are anonymous.

1) Create a bitcoin wallet (it's free) using something like MultiBit.
2) Create an account on one of the exchanges (avoid MtGox and ignore their price, it's only indicative of how hard it is to get cash out of MtGox).
3) Wire money to your exchange
4) Buy bitcoins
5) Withdraw bitcoins to your wallet
You can skip steps 2-5 and [buy bitcoins locally]( but that will likely cost you more.


It's deflation. Inflation is when currency loses value, not gains it.
There are two reasons for Bitcoin deflation
1) Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary. Its total supply is mathematically limited. Bitcoins will be lost. Value will rise.
2) Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream. More people are interested. Demand is growing. Supply is limited. Therefore the price increases.

To mine just 1 BTC you would need an ASIC system that can mine at least in the hundreds of GH/sec, they are not cheap. And you have to get it fast, because difficulty increases exponentially every month, and you basically halve (or even worse) your profits every month.
[This one]( will make you 1BTC in 10 days at the current difficulty level, but by the time you receive that thing, it will probably be 20 to 50 days, if you're very lucky. ASIC systems are flooding the mining market, and it's possible the difficulty will skyrocket in a few days.

The main problem I see with this is cheating.
Pretty much every competitive online game is full of cheaters.
When BTC is involved, forget about it.
It's a really really cool idea though. Online gaming needs to become as profitable as soccer, basketball, american football, golf, cricket, etc.

I will happily accept your unneeded dollars.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:49:48
Ah, you're assuming the index funds you've picked would return 5-10% annualized for the next 50 years. 
That would be hard to do even post-factum looking at the past performance. How are you going to do it without knowing the future?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:50:49
The problem with fiat currenciesis not the fast transmission - we've solved it already - PayPal, WesternUnion, etc. 
The problem with fiat currencies is the control and all the insane laws around it.
So yeah, they can go ahead, good luck to them.

Yeah. How can there possibly be no maximum? (assuming you're talking in today's dollars).
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:02:30


Pyramid schemes fail as soon as there aren't enough new people with new money joining in, and they always fail because the rate at which "fresh blood" must flow in is exponential.
If, let's say, Bitcoin closes its doors now, doesn't let a single new buyer in, and its USD value remains constant, it will still be viable, because it has some very very useful properties - fast nearly free transactions, near anonymity, no central authority, impossible to shut down, easy integration, etc.


Yeah, I don't think BTC origins matter anymore. It's an open source project supported by multiple people. There are no secret backdoors in it.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:54:23

There should be no unencrypted wallets, unless you specifically ask for it.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:53:09
Well, there are many ways of looking at it - in volume and in absolute price delta it was the largest.
Percentage-wise, the first major crash was the largest.
Hey, if it goes down 80%, it means the price will fall to $240. I will happily spend all my savings at that price range. And many other people would too. I wouldn't mind it.

I'd say do it in parts. Start with something relatively small and see if it works.
I'd try Bitstamp. 
MtGox is a black hole.
BTC-E withdrawal worked for me (in EUR), but the whole exchange is a bit shady.
You can always sell slowly on localbitcoins at a great price, but it will take time.

You can't exactly flood the market with BTC, there are only 21 million of them, and they are growing like crazy because the demand is so high, and there aren't enough BTC for everyone.
If BTC becomes a global currency at the USD level, owning 1 BTC will be extremely rare.

Most supercomputers would suck at mining. Even the ones with GPUs. An average ASIC can mine faster than a thousand average GPUs.

That's actually false.
Imagine wallets A, B, F, X, Z.
You move 1 BTC in each transaction like this:
    A -&gt; F
    B -&gt; F
    F -&gt; X
    F -&gt; Z
Now, can  you trace where money in X came from? All you can tell is that it came from F, but then you're stuck. You don't know if it came from A or B or both.

Guys, don't listen to this snake oil bullshit, please. None of it can tell you whether the price will go up or down. If it were possible, the OP would write a robot to do his trading automatically and would make unlimited money. And he would never tell you his secret sauce - who wants competition.

I asked this same question today.
So you send your cheap BTC to BitChina, trade them for CNY, and then what? You will need a Chinese bank account to wire them to and then wire them to your exchange in USD. 
I don't have a Chinese bank account and have no idea how to get one.

As somebody who has traded stocks in the past, things like this happen from time to time to undervalued stocks that get discovered, and the price can skyrocket 100X in a matter of hours, not days.
Bitcoin is becoming a global currency, and its current total value (market cap) is around $7.5 billion. It's not much at all on a global scale with trillions of dollars and trillions of euros floating around.
This increase is not massive yet. The realistic goal is $10,000 - 50,000 per BTC.

Bitcoin *is* unhackable for all practical purposes.
However user's computers get compromised all the time. Go to some shady website, get infected with malware with a zero day exploit, get your private key stolen.
That's why if you really care about security, you store your BTC in a cold wallet.

@_date: 2013-11-22 13:04:33
I was going to write about this, but for larger amounts.
When it comes to 1BTC, it makes very little difference. Just buy at the market rate. 
Exchanges like Bitstamp have different transaction rates depending on how much you trade. So if you have $100,000, it would be stupid to just place a $100K trade, you will get the worst possible transaction rate of 0.5%. If you trade according to their [fee schedule]( you will get the best possible rates.
So you first buy $500 (lowered to 0.48%)
Then you buy another $500 (lowered to 0.46%)
Then you buy $1000 (lowered to 0.44%)
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:57:11

There's no problem exchanging Yuan for USD:
Not only that, if you have a Chinese bank, you can just wire the money and let the receiving bank do the conversion (which they will probably rip you off on, but not that badly).

The transaction fee is above 1 penny. It's currently at 0.0001 BTC, which is around 10 US cents.
So sending you a penny is a waste of a fee.

@_date: 2013-12-01 23:41:36
Maybe it is your fault, I don't know.
Maybe your computer got a keylogger, so they logged in into the exchange, did the withdrawal, clicked on the confirmation link in an email and deleted the email.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:02:47
That would be a very stupid move though. If you dump it slowly, 1K BTC at a time, you will make much more.

Is that really a problem? From programmer's perspective, it's trivial to adjust prices once a minute, for instance. You can even have javascript running and adjusting the prices on the page in near real-time.
If you're afraid of BTC volatility so much, why are you in business of dealing with it?


Transaction fees.


No, not in our universe.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:07:09


No, that BTC will get split and moved to a thousand different wallets, and then moved randomly to thousands of other wallets, and then funnelled through a wash service where it gets mixed and split with other money. And then will get slowly traded for gold, goods, or just cash on LocalBitcoins. 
You can't trace that.


In BTC they do.

The thing is, MultiBit is open source
It's very unlikely it has a backdoor in it.
Most likely you got infected by a keylogger .
EDIT: Btw, MultiBit was created by Jim Burton, he's not some shady criminal, he does conference talks, etc. If he were stealing money, he would be found pretty quickly.

He's right. The same exact questions are asked 50 times a day. People are just lazy to use the search function.
Here are the classics:
1) I'm new to bitcoin, explain it to me
2) Bitcoin is going to crash, I'm warning you
3) Convince me to invest in bitcoin
4) Do you think bitcoin will go up?
5) I sent my money to MtGox, and now they won't let me access them till I get verified.
6) How do I buy bitcoins?
7) How do I buy bitcoins fast?
8) Why is BTC so much cheaper at exchange A than at exchange B?
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:59:24
BTC-E = $794
MtGox = $871
Considering you've made a trivial mistake thinking BTC-E is more expensive, maybe that shit isn't for you.

Yeah, a bounce to a near all-time high is not "dead cat bounce".
The first peak was at $1163, the bounce was to $1148 (Bitstamp prices). 
This is a dead cat bounce:
You keep thinking that predicting a crash (without specifying when and how much) is some hard prophecy-like skill. The reason nobody takes you seriously is because we have 20 idiots like you a day telling us it will crash, or it will go to the moon.
If you want to be taken seriously, predict right now when and to what price it will crash. Otherwise enjoy your stupid comments downvoted.

I wired a significant sum of money to them, around what you're asking about. Their bank is in Slovenia, the company itself is in the UK.
The nice thing is, they accept deposits in USD, so you don't get burned on the conversion rate.
Make sure to get verified before sending them the money.
They also don't accept wires from 3rd parties, so talk to their support before sending money from a corporate account.

You have to realize order book changes very fast.
The way I trade is I always set up a limit order at the best price I see, but very often by the time the order gets sent, that price is gone, and I just have a hanging order, which I have to go and cancel.
Considering how fast bitcoins are going up, you're wasting bitcoins just talking to us here.
If you really insist on getting a very good deal, see how the fluctuations are going, for instance on Bitstamp it's jumping between 735 and 755 now. I'd set a limit order at like 740 or 745 and see if it executes within 5-10 minutes. If it doesn't, raise it. Chances are, you will do worse than just buying at the market rate, considering how fast BTCs are going up.

You can turn most of his arguments against bitcoin back onto fiat currency and onto gold.
His reasoning behind gold is circular - "gold has an intrinsic value, because it's gold".
He will say that gold is limited like bitcoin, which is flat out false. Amount of gold is not limited in any real sense, there are trillions of tons of it in the universe. It's mined at the rate of 2500 tons per year just on our planet.

What's your proof of that? The number of wallets storing even a  thousand of coins is tiny. That's *nothing* compared to what people speculate and invest in out in the world.
I'd say the majority are both. We're enjoying this ride, but the end goal is that most of us want an independent way to store and move money around.

Yes, currencies can be used for illegal activities.
In this particular example the stupid laws are the problem. There's a huge demand for drugs. For some strange reason some drugs are legal (alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine) and some are not.

They don't even need to buy Coinbase for that.

Nobody knows where the price is going. It's possible it will crash and you will make money. It's possible it will keep going up and you will lose BTC.

From 2000 to 2010, for example.
Inflation-adjusted, it most certainly did many many many times. For example, from 1974 to 1984.

1) If your wallet is encrypted with a good password, it doesn't matter if somebody finds your USB drive. If they do know your password, you should immediately move your money to a new wallet in case of a backup loss.
2) Never back up anything on USB drives, they are the least reliable things and get lost. Back up online, send it to your own Gmail, email it to your family. The file is tiny.


Anybody who finds it can have access to your bitcoins.

Again, if you were making more money than everyone else here (which we have no evidence of), why in the world would you tell everyone how to do it? That would kill your silly scheme (assuming it worked, which it doesn't).
Btw, your prediction of the price going up is already wrong, the price just dropped to $825.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:31:56
OK, linking to some article doesn't prove you wrote it. Many such articles are written all the time about the economy collapse. 99.99% of them are wrong.
Considering that article was written on  2008-11-21, which is after the stocks collapsed, I don't see how that's a prediction of anything.
As I said, start making specific predictions. Not just some vague bullshit like you did so far.

I don't get where that figure came from.
At the very least it's about to eat WesternUnion, MoneyGram and a lot of Paypal's business. It will also take a share of currency exchange businesses. And it will take a huge share of the silver- and gold-hoarding market.
That's not even counting all the stores that start accepting it.

None of that matters. If somebody hacks into the exchange, they can interact with the verification server and send fake transfer requests to any servers.
I haven't seen any secure architectures for something like that.


Which the hacked server must know in order to interact with them.

No, the more you send, the larger the fee is, but it's actually tiny when you send a lot. I recently moved 40 BTC with a 0.0002 BTC fee.
Technically, one can try and send money without a fee, and I would do it for you, but my client doesn't allow me to set the fee.

Save all of your encrypted bitcoin wallet data in something like Keepass (private key, encryption key, you can even save the wallet itself, just base64-encode it).
Make sure your KeePass password is strong, long, and you can remember it. Make sure it's NOT a common phrase.
After that you can upload your KeePass database into multiple places - you can email it to yourself, save it onto a thumb drive, upload it to Sky Drive, etc.
If you have funds for it, print out your KeePass password (just the password, so it's not obvious what it's for) and put the sheet of paper in a sefety deposit box.
Once you're done 
1) Test that you can recover your wallet using KeePass alone
2) Actually delete your wallet, securely.
Bonus points if you do all of the above on a virtual machine with an antivirus.

Buying should be safe.

You can't just magically push the price to $10K, you either need to interest and involve many more people, or you need some very rich people to push tons of their money into it. The second option will not magically make them billions, since it's their money to begin with.
The only real options for sustained growth is to spread Bitcoin and make major shops and shop networks to accept it. Once  Amazon, Walmart, Starbucks, Kroger, Target, Walgreen, Costco, Home Depot, CVS accept BTC, you can reasonably expect the $10K price.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:24:19
I like the idea, but there needs to be a content producer's fee as well, and the producer's identity must be verifiable, maybe with certificates. I can see it being abused though.

This question is asked a dozen times a day, and the answer is always the same - the exchanges are very independent, there's no easy way to get the cash out of MtGox, it takes months. So it can be $5000 at MtGox and $1000 at Bitstamp, and there's not much you can do.
Another partial explanation is very different walls - MtGox has a huge wall at $1202, while Bitstamp has almost double amount of multiple walls all the way to $1200. Hence MtGox has a relatively easy ride till $1202, while Bitstamp is going to struggle at $1015, $1020, $1048, $1099.

I've been thinking about this exactly, it would be cool to have a feature "sell X amount if there's a single transaction below price Z". It would indeed act as a crash proof system.
Bitstamp doesn't have that, unfortunately.
They have API though, so you could still automate it.

Why don't you run the miner on one of them and see.
I'm 100% certain you will spend more on electricity, and you will mine no reasonable amount of mBTC.
i7 CPUs used to mine at around 30-40 KH/s.
Radeon HD 7970 can mine at around 300-310 MH/s.
So one GPU will be faster than a hundred CPUs.
But even GPUs are useless now. It's all ASIC in the hundreds of GH/s range.
