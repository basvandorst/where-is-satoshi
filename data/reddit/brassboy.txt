@_date: 2018-09-29 09:43:10
Good luck waiting twenty years
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:00:57
Go Jihadi Jihan!
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:15:43
That is the luck of the draw. And bitcoins luck may have just run out

@_date: 2017-08-07 14:21:16
Fuck your mother if you want fuck

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:00:04
They'll be the ones in a death spiral soon enough
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:47:51
Roger Ver must be shitting his pants right about now
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:47:32
Didn't he move 25000 BTC to an exchange after the 2800 high?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:22:55
fuck you man i needed more time to sell now i'm down 5 figs
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:00:39

Wow scumbag doesn't even begin to describe what I think of him right now...
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:46:16
Agree. Fuck that guy Roger Wu.
They all make me so angry
They need to go to jail with their pump and dump alt bcash
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:20:59
What a shitcase.
@_date: 2017-04-30 08:56:06
The central banking cartel is fucked and they know it. Fiat currency will descend into a hyperinflationary holocaust over the next two decades. Buy crypto, gold, anything but holding worthless debt-backed government paper.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:12:33
We absolutely must remove Princess Jihan and Backdoor Judas or bitcoin is going to turn into an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:23:14
Well done guys keep on HODLDING
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:30:00
Roger we are going to push you out of Bitcoin whether you like it or now. Just like with whiny ragequitter Hearn.
@_date: 2017-04-29 09:53:05
Large blockers have a hard fork stuck up their ass
@_date: 2017-04-29 19:13:03
You forgot Gavin Andresen. Man he became so forgettable after he went full-retard
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:19:33
Fucking Roger Wu why can't he leave Bitcoin the fuck alone.
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:24:24
It's time Roger had a good rodgering
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:58:34
Can we just turn Ver into a pizza and eat him?
@_date: 2017-04-29 19:12:20
He will be next on that list.
@_date: 2017-04-30 22:56:37
$6 is only 0.6% when you are transferring $1000. A bargain if I do say so myself.
You're not supposed to transfer such small amounts. Either load up with more bitcoin and try again or wait until you do have that much to transfer.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:37:49
Excellent choice! Don't pay any attention to those altcoins that are currently rising they aren't as secure as bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-04-29 12:42:51
You done fucked up roger
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:08:18
Backdoor Ver must have soiled his pants by now
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:12:20
Why does it not fucking budge
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:28:18
Does this mean that bitcoin adoption is receding?
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:41:32
Cmon man - we just have to implement Simplicity on EVM
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:34:05
What about ver?
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:50:20
I learned it in my first year of computer science. It was a bitch
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:08:20
August 1st will become known as Bitcoin Independence Day
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:18:00
Fucking USAF already chikuns
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:41:01
I'm fucking sick and tired of all the promises fucking USAF/Segwit already ok?
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:29:43
Should have been No -&gt; Buy Bitcoin anyway you fucktard
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:01:46
You are merely rich. If you were truly wealthy you would be able to afford a Lambo or whatever
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:56:44
Bitcoin is the most valuable because literally it's the only coin that the man on the street has heard of
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:40:18
How can bitcoin moon if it's not ready for the mainstream? Some real brightsparks in bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:19:27
Fucking golddiggers why would you even want one?
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:43:02
What's next is USAF motherfucker
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:12:39
If we don't moon now we never will 
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:49:55
I MA HODLING BICTOIN
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:02:44
Such leonardo, much da vinci
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:35:38
USA is behind UASF
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:24:39
Damn right USAF motherfuckers
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:54:15
What can you expect from the Backdoor Unlimited tools?
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:09:55
Your paying for the gilt-edged service. Made In China.
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:18:40
Finally, mining pools seeing sense. I predict the rest will fall in line very quickly (I"m looking at you Jihad) after ViaBTC switches to Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:31:43
lol CIA Gavin c'mon. Almost as bad as that whiny ass hearn
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:08:40
I thought USAF was American?
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:43:37
Ver can have his hard fork... shoved up his ass
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:57:01
Incredible that one man holds the key to whether Segwit can activate on Bitcoin. Something isn't very decentralised here.
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:40:04
Fucking UASF commie scum
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:44:56
Simple, blow Antpool to smithereens, killing Wu in the process
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:17:34
What are we waiting for?! Shit or get off the pot
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:01:05
USD is the worst altcoin of them all.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:00:03
USAF was going to happen until Greg shit on it
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:27:21
Nothing will be done because nothing can be done
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:29:38
Fucking coinbase they are part of the cancer. Their investor backdoor ver needs to go, now
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:58:00
It's only a matter of time now before Segwit is activated on Bitcoin. Hopefully all the Backdoor Unlimited supporters will accept the new order or leave Bitcoin for good.
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:11:02
Exactly, remove people like Ver and Wu and Segwit would reach 95% overnight
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:46:22
Core just have to move the goalposts as they have always done. They will change Segwit so that it activates with 70% or even 50% majority. Litecoin proves that 75% is safe.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:10:19
Target: Ver's house
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:37:56
Bitcoin is now more popular than ever. Wonder how that will be impacted by the high fees?
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:09:43
**U** **AS**k **F**or it
@_date: 2017-05-04 07:50:22
Fucking Fed trash. Its not even very nice toilet paper.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:45:24
If you don't like it then time to USAF you fucks
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:50:00
If it wasn't him someone else would have done it probably not more than a couple hours after him
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:31:36
Fucking USAF now
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:08:41
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:44:15
Lightning is such cool tech I don't understand why people wouldn't want it here already 
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:11:10
That's not hodling - never sell
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:41:24
Another 5 years should do it. If you don't like that then fucking go join USAF, now.
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:08:16
The final solution to the scaling problem is to remove the leaders of the enemy camp, Backdoor Ver and Jihad Wu.
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:16:00
Never forget the first rule of whale club: Don't short Bitcoin you fucking fuck
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:36:24
It's time for the son to outshine the father.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:13:14
Roger Wu fails at life again
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:01:07
You'll be wanting the EUSF (End User Soft Fork) then
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:06:24
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:11:54
Bad actors
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:49:19
Roger 'Backdoor' Wu has made his own bed now he has to lie in it
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:47:00
Coinbase is doing good considering how much business they transact. How do you know Gemini won't also become the same when it gets to a similar size?
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:22:29
What about Satoshi's coins?
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:02:21
Roger Wu needs to back the fuck off
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:12:37
USAF can't come soon enough
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:18:53
I thought bitcoin wasn't meant for the poor. Make up your mind
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:33:14
I think CB will get better now they got rid of that slacker Charlie Lee
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:13:49
Shut up and just pay the higher fee already if you want faster service.
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:19:17
Great you're now set for life!!
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:55:07
Fuck you Jihan and fuck you Roger
USAF is the only way now
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:16:16
We're going to the moon on Russian spacecraft!
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:48:01
Stupid speculators - this is going to lead to the biggest crypto bull market in history

Miners need to stay in the cave and shut up
