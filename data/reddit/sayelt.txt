Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:30:48
Bitcoin is not some rich/libertarians-people-only club.
@_date: 2016-08-10 03:46:54
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:32:46
Does it have daily limits?
@_date: 2016-08-14 01:45:22
I feel the same way, I don't like libertarianism, I like bitcoin a lot.
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:16:31
That's BS, I'm by no means rich and bitcoin is one of these things that has helped me more than anything else out there. Thanks to bitcoin I can work remotely and get paid for my work.

Passphrase seed support similar to Electrum.
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:36:49
Roger Ver, fuck you.
@_date: 2016-08-24 01:46:19
Waiting for the Arch Linux package update:
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:32:42
Can't wait. I'm switching to Core (from Electrum) with the v0.13 release.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:06:55
This Bruce guy sounds like he doesn't understand FOSS at all, I don't think most developers are looking for any adulation at all.


@_date: 2016-08-02 05:28:17
Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2016-08-24 02:37:58
Why did I get downvoted for this?
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:04:43
@_date: 2016-08-24 17:29:08
How do I verify my binaries with the archlinux package?
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:00:34
Richie Rich.
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:28:16
Wouldn't that affect the decentralized nature of Bitcoin in a negative way?
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:21:07
It's already been updated on Arch Linux too:
@_date: 2016-10-05 02:36:25
Is Electrum segwit ready?
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:03:56
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:13:51
What is the real Satoshi address?
Can someone share this as a reference please?

What is the advantage of using Bitcoin Core over something like Electrum (and other SPV clients)?
For some reason I feel a sense of security when using Core.
@_date: 2016-07-24 02:43:36
BTC is actually the only way I can get paid for my work since I work remotely, so I disagree with you.
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:27:59
I don't know, I'll keep my Electrum seed for a while (just in case I receive funds in my Electrum wallet/address), but I will use Bitcoin Core as my main wallet.
I plan to transfer my funds from Electrum to Bitcoin Core.
I actually receive my salary in BTC and my living depends on it, I want to be as safe as possible.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:11:49
Do you encrypt them? What filesystem do you prefer to use on them? Do you prefer keeping your same wallet.dat backup across multiples USB?
@_date: 2016-07-20 17:39:59
Can't wait for this to land on archlinux.
@_date: 2016-05-06 01:07:21
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:36:58
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:28:56
Do you encrypt the drive itself, the filesystem or the actual wallet.dat?
What do you use for that?
I'm on GNU/Linux.
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:32:45
Yeah, I'm holding. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:34:47
What does being poor or not have to do with this? How being poor affects your chances of running a full node?
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:15:02
I'm switching from Electrum to Core once 0.13 is released, deterministic wallets FTW.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:50:48
Why ext3 and not ext4 BTW?
@_date: 2016-07-24 15:42:33
You make it sound like accepting bitcoin is a lot of hassle, it's not. So I still disagree with you.
@_date: 2016-07-23 18:15:01


What does his profession has to do with anything? I use bitcoin to get paid for my work and it works really well.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:27:45
bitcoin-qt already got flagged out-of-date on Arch Linux.
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:08:57
How do you guys backup your wallet.dat? What kind of storage do you use?
Any advice on this?
@_date: 2016-07-23 17:39:13
Why would you say that? I'm getting paid in BTC for my work and it works really well.
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:08:52
Is bandwidth the main issue when it comes to the economics? Can poor folks just go to a LAN or internet cafe where bandwidth is cheap and fast and do a pruned sync there?
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:22:01
Indeed, not a big loss; And I have more BTC coming to me, so no biggie. :)
@_date: 2016-07-17 01:25:27
I use Electrum currently, but I plan to switch to Bitcoin Core when 0.13 is released (yay HD wallets).
