Wow! This is so creative... Andreas is THE best speaker that I have watched and listened to, to date.

I too have "binge watched" them all. He is a great orator of whom I am addicted to for getting straight talking, no nonesense, honest to goodness facts. A tech genius &amp; cares for the ordinary human being.

Listen to Andreas Antonopoulos regarding how to safeguard your seeds.  Cold storage on a Trezor or ledger Nano S?
