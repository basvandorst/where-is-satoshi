Christ, it worked. Glad I was able to keep all the correct key files. 
Successfully recovering a few btc after having to export. 
Time to get rid of Multibit for good!
I’m using Exodus.io, anyone have any other suggestions? 
@_date: 2018-05-05 23:04:31
Was trying that but the electrum wallet won’t open so I’m not sure. Will check the other link 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:40:39
I have my wallet and info files. Is that enough to sufficiently back up to another wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-05 23:35:31
Both wallets wouldn’t open. My multibit was opening few months ago last I checked. Have t changed the computer since then been busy at work and playing xbox. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 00:08:40
Panic due to large amount. I think I figured it out. It synced and now I can export the keys to a new file and import from there. Will update with results

When I am opening my multibit file like she does in the video it does not appear the same. Mine seems all encrypted and unreadable while hers shows her keys. What do I do someone please help me
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:29:30
I do have .key files but are unreadable in text editors
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:52:00
Currently in the process of reformatting my laptop. Hopefully what I have is enough to back up and export. Hoping the wallet software actually opens for me 
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:50:28
Thanks, again. 
Is There any type of source code available for the Trezor? Or any similar hardware wallet? Are they open source? 
I feel like it could be done without firmware but obviously st this point I don’t have much of a clue other then some past programming experience. Not specific to this or anything close. 
Like a wallet then generates a new address and keys each time or something. 
Thanks for answering my questions.

Have to reformat my laptop so I need to know if I am still able to export my keys. And if I do export them still need to know if it will send transactions. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:09:59
If I cannot get the wallet to open under  circumstances am I stil able to export the private keys? The guide assumes the program will open. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:21:42
I have .wallet files, .info files , .checkpoint files ,
.key files
The following folders;
I hope I have the right things

Can you explain to me the difference between an encrypted USB and a hardware wallet? Couldn’t I make one myself with a USB key and something like Truecrypt for example? 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:15:23
Thanks for the detailed answer! There must be some other way to have an on the fly type of encryption that won’t reveal itself.
When these hardware wallets are doing the signing and sending what exactly is being done software level on it that a USB couldn’t be perhaps programmed to do? (I guess these sort of are programmed, from Trezor or etc) 
Any more info on how exactly they work is appreciated

Currently the only thing I can think of is opening wallets up on Multibit but it’s taking fucking forever to download the block chains and I have to do that for 3 wallets. 
Someone. Please. Help...
I can’t afford to lose this money just because I wasn’t using my computer when Multibit died
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:24:02
Did I fuck up? Is this recoverable? 
What if when Multibit finishes syncing. It is discontinued though...
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:02:04
I am trying to import my keys into electrum and nothing is working
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:06:41
Ok thanks. Should be able to export properly then. I hope my worries are false lol
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:19:39
Windows 7 home premium, I’m going to have to reformat to soon since it’s having some issues. 
I have my multibit keys backed up. I just don’t know how to :
A) open the wallet to export them (if I need to? I have files in my wallets app data folder)
Or b) export it to another wallet. 
If electrum isn’t working properly what should I do? I’ve uninstalled and ccleaned, shutdown and reinstalled and still had issues. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 00:02:55
I might try to use my virtual machine to open the wallets there 
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:00:05
Just send me a message when you’re here and I’ll follow along. Thanks for the help. Syncing the wallet in the meantime, the one that I loaded up into Multibit. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:50:17
Haven’t been as active on my computer for a while and I hope I haven’t lost access to some of my bitcoin because of it. 
I tried downloading electrum but that also doesn’t open after being installed. Not sure if it’s my computer or if that is also discontinued. 
Any help is appreciated. I would hate to lose this over something so stupid. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 00:10:41
I should have upgraded from Multibit a long time ago but I got lazy and I guess this is what I get for it. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:34:31
Any help would be appreciated, I haven’t really been active on my computer in a few months and now that seems to have been the downfall. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:53:11
If your able can you download multi bit classic and open it? Not sure if they have just stopped updating it or actually full on shut it down
@_date: 2018-05-14 03:23:47
Thanks will try out when home from work

When I load the wallet files into Multibit it works but is taking forever to sync. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:06:16
On Multibit, I have my .wallet and .info files for my respective wallets. I can’t get my VMs to open as I’m afraid the computer is fucked. 
Is this enough to successfully backup my shit to another wallet?
I can’t get multibit or any other wallet to open up. How will I proceed??
Please help someone. All help is appreciated
