So, I've recently heard of two ways to get Bitcoin with a credit/debit card.  I've never used these methods, but Stephanie Murphy has recommended both of these methods:
1) 
It seems that you can use a credit card to buy Linden dollars, which you can then exchange for Bitcoin.
2) 
This is a service which allows users to buy Amazon items for other users, who then reimburse the purchaser with Bitcoins.
Again, I've never used them so I can't vouch for the reliability or ease of these methods, but they seem easy enough.

That's a tremendous percentage, but really not that uncommon among new or almost dead coins.  Usually new coins are lucky to have more than one or two pools at start and dying coins have a lot of pools shut down, leaving one or two or sometimes no pools left.

I know this is an old thread, but I have an idea:
Why don't you create your own cryptocurrency (it may be much easier than you think) and allow a classroom economy to grow with that currency as its basis?  If you don't release it to the public, the mining, distribution, and trade of the entire currency could be limited to just those within your class.
Not sure about how feasible this is, but I imagine something like this: 
Create a coin that's mineable on CPUs (phones, tablets, and computer processors), with quick block times, low block rewards, and a low market cap which will fully mature within the school year.  This will allow most kids to mine it themselves on available hardware and will allow the kids to experience the currency after all the coins have been created.  Anyway, just a quick idea and may not be implementable- please let me know what you think.

This is my hump-day- I'll join anyone still popping tops on Sunday morning.
This hasn't been so bad for my investment (bought in the $90s), but it's making me nervous because I'm less than two weeks from quitting my job to join my friend's computer repair company where my contribution is supposed to be my experience with cryptocurrency mining.
Plus, I just bought another vehicle and haven't sold my other one so I don't have any extra cash to buy at these low prices :(  Oh well, there will be other buy opportunities.

Let's Talk Bitcoin had a discussion with one of their head people.  From what I remember, they shut down voluntarily in order to get legit.  Now, once they spent thousands to become licensed in all 50 states, no banks will deal with them.  They laid off a lot of their staff and seem to be biding their time.  Not looking good, IMHO, but things tend to change suddenly in the cryptoworld.
Let's Talk Bitcoin episode in question:

The way I understand it, in the US at least the exchange to fiat is the primary problem preventing businesses from accepting BTC in two ways: 1) volatility and 2) exchanging to/from USD makes BTC users liable for taxes- which is a dangerously ambiguous area of the law, at best.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:46:07
I bought 6 BTC after the SR bust @ $90 each. Over the past 24 hours I have been slowly selling my BTC until I make back my investment amount. I hope it makes a large correction back down soon so I can reinvest some of it, but I'm happy if it keeps booming since I still have 4 BTC left.
I expected to already have had a correction, but the price seems to keep stabilizing after small dumps then growing to new heights. That in mind, I have no idea what to expect or when- except that the steadiness that this rise exhibits suggests that the long-term price will be much higher.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:45:48
Yeah, they sent me an e-mail within the hour telling me that my deposit has been received and was being forwarded to bitfloor.  Unfortunately, bitfloor was down at that time, but later I was able to log in and I had a USD balance that it allowed me to buy bitcoin with.
In order for them to know it whose bitfloor account to deposit the money into, your deposit amount HAS TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME as the deposit amount they gave you to deposit.  You can't round that amount in any way.

Fiat currencies are subject to high inflation. A bag of chips doesn't and hasn't always cost a dollar just as milk hasn't always been $4/gallon, new cars haven't always cost more than $10k, and so on throughout most of the economy. I understand there are more factors at play which determine the price, my point is that it's an assumption that things priced in fiat will be stable. Usually, if the price stays the same in response to inflation, then the quality of ingredients or the amount of that product in the package are decreasing.
Personally, I would rather pay and be paid in a deflationary currency, even if the price is volatile.

Right, I'm there with you.  If I hadn't bought mining equipment with my BTC, I would have 8 more coins.  $6400 (low estimate) is a lot to me :(  But, all said and done, I'm $2000 dollars ahead as it is so I'm satisfied so far.  Right now I'm mining as many altcoins as I can because they are really seeing a boom.  Hopefully, one or two will take off like BTC has.

I only have about 1/3 of all the BTC I've ever bought/mined.  The other 2/3 was spent on mining equipment and that's a good amount of value lost :(  Nevertheless, I'm still about $1000 in the positive after all is accounted for :D  The most expensive BTC I ever bought was $140.

I sold two BTC at about 270 so that I could make my initial investment back from buying 6 for 540.  If I had held, I could currently sell just over 1 BTC to make back that same amount.  Sucks to see in retrospect, but oh well, I'm still way ahead on the 4 BTC I have left.
@_date: 2013-11-17 10:46:28
There are no local sellers of BTC around me, so when I use localbitcoins.com I have to use WU or find someone with a Well's Fargo account.  Depositing money into someone else's account is off-putting, but it has always worked well for me.  
If you don't want to trust a localBTC user to send your BTC after depositing your cash, try cashintocoins.com- it's the same idea (depositing cash into a guy's account), but this is his business and reputation, he has a money transmitter's license, and I have heard of no complaints about him.
@_date: 2013-07-12 05:57:00
I'm sorry, it's not obvious to me: why doesn't it matter how quickly blocks are mined?  Doesn't faster block completion equal more BTCs being dispersed at a time?  Or are you saying the difficulty adjustment will correct the rate in the future?
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:32:58
Yes, you can place a bid (buy order) at any price just like you can set an ask (sell order) at any price.  The catch is, there has to be someone willing to sell to your bidding price or buy to your asking price.  Also, if you make a bid for 1 BTC at x price but someone is only willing to sell 0.1 BTC at that price, then only 0.1 BTC will be sold.  
Say you place a bid for $1/BTC, before your bid is filled (completed in full), two things must happen: 1. Everyone who bids higher must have their orders filled/removed, and 2. There must be a seller willing to sell the amount you want at the price you want.
Hope this lifts the fog of confusion somewhat.

When BTC was still $200, they were on Amazon for $10.  Since the actual cost of Block Erupters are about 0.05 BTC, the price for them offered by Amazon retailers is actually over $30 now.

I told you they're right here on this subreddit. Any Bitcoin podcast/youtube channel have also rebutted some or all of these. If you don't like it, then get the fuck out.

I think the delay you're experiencing is because of Coinbase's policies.  I've never used them, but I believe they delay your delivery a few days for whatever reason.  Bitcoin does have a small delay while your transactions are finding a block, but that shouldn't be more than 10 minutes usually.

^^ Great example of that is Bitinstant.  They voluntarily shut down in order to spend millions to get a money transmitter's license in all 50 states and once they had gone above-board with their practice no bank would work with them.  It wasted resources and ruined what was a great service for Bitcoiners.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:33:06
That's because their cost is still 0.05 BTC.
Now: 0.05 x $600 (estimation) = $30 / Block Erupter
Last week: 0.05 x $300 (estimation) = $15 / Block Erupter

I think Peter Schiff must have worked at Verizon because, according to him, 1 BTC is equal to 0.00000001 BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:08:35
I was going crazy about how Stefan just seemed to accept Peter's argument that a bank could create a cryptocurrency and peg it to gold in their vaults and that if that happened then BTC would have its ultimate nemesis and would probably meet its downfall.  Does "decentralized" mean nothing to them and add no value to Bitcoin?
That and Peter sounded like an anti-hard money advocate for a while.  I was wondering if he realized that if the topic was gold then his opponent would be using those exact same talking points.

Have you used this LocalTill service before?
  
To use BOA, you have to deposit money into their account.  Kinda bugs me.
Edit: Well, I'm going to try it.
Edit: I'm nervous about it.  The nearest BoA is an hour away.  Hopefully I'll have some good news in two hours, once I get home.  It should only take 30 minutes to clear LocalTill, so I should know once I get home.
Edit: Well, I deposited cash in BoA and got an e-mail confirming that the transaction went through, but now I can't get on bitfloor.com to see if they're in my account.  Anyone know anything about what's going on with bitfloor?
Final Edit:  Success! My test run of $100 went through LocalTill within an hour and I was able to spend the money on Bitfloor once the site came back up.  I was unable to do a second transaction because Bitfloor's downtime lasted until after the BoA closed.  I would have dropped another $350 on BTCs if it hadn't been for that.
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:04:27
Please do, but I'm lucky to be able to buy BTC at less than $20 over the current Mt. Gox exchange price so I would much rather spend my fiat.  Once I'm able to be paid in BTC, then it will be worth it to me to spend BTC.  I'm not going to ask if I can pay in BTC because I don't want to have to decline if they say yes.

I respectfully disagree.  Paying for violence or overpaying for inferior services, products, or "inventions" is nothing to be proud of even granted the few decent things, like the Internet, which has come from taking others' things without permission- the benefits do not outweigh the societal costs.  Furthermore, in a world in which reality TV is normal and a police state is legal, there is nothing smart or moral about conforming to these "standards."  All said, I use BTCGuild and, of my experience at least, you all run the most professional pool I've seen and I have been extremely happy purchasing your Block Eruptors.  The personal opinion of any individual working with you is not my concern, but if I catch wind that BTCGuild is publicly promoting, through word or fiat or crypto, the taxation and regulation of any crypto then I'll have to take my massive (as if, lol) 3GH/elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:22:45
Not entirely sure what you're asking, but:
If you place an order at a certain exchange rate (let's say 0.01 BTC for 1 LTC), then it won't fill that order until the exchange rate matches your requested exchange rate.  It won't make you buy for higher than you want or make you sell for lower than you want- it will wait until the exchange price matches yours.

Very impressive for an affiliate of a mainstream news channel.
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:51:16
This is a good answer since the price of a currency is also effected by the number of people using it.  Bitcoin is being inflated, but the number of people using it is inflating faster.  If the Bitcoin economy was shrinking, then the value would most likely be dropping.  Reportedly, a lot of Chinese consumers are buying Bitcoin- thereby distributing a somewhat limited supply of Bitcoin among a larger consumer base.
Tl;dr- yes, BTC is inflating, but the BTC user base is inflating faster.  Without the latter, the first would cause a drop in prices.  IMHO- the user base is no where close to reaching its potential.

All of these have been rebutted in several places - I've even seen some rebuttals in "new" posts within the past few hours in this subreddit.  If you don't want Shitcoin, then don't buy any.  By the way, that applies to Bitcoin, too, since I believe you're not actually referencing [Shitcoin]( you're just calling names.  
If you have rebuttals to the rebuttals, then you have something to offer.  Until then, you're "investing" your time towards repeating a task which has been shot down plenty of times before.  Don't you have anything better to do than spam this subreddit with your tired arguments?  Or are you trying to get someone else to do your research for you?

It's been an exciting couple of days for me, unfortunately I'm not a vocal person.  I should have invested last August when I heard of them, but I was focused on precious metals.
Thanks to the dip, I'm now a proud owner of about 5.75 BTC.  I've heard a lot of speculation that BTC is dead, but for me it's just an opportunity.  Next step?  I plan to figure out how to use my gaming PC for mining while I'm not using it.
