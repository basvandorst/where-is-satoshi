This is really not rocket science here.
**DON'T APPROVE THE ACCOUNT FOR FUNDING** until you satisfy yourself on the KYC/AML front.
Don't provide wire instructions or account number until you are prepared to accept incoming wires.
Once you have approved an account, provide wire instructions.
When incoming wire arrives, either it matches and is accepted, or it does not match, in which case it is rejected.
This is really not rocket science here.

Hey Mr Banker, guess how we move money to GDAX for "business" trading?  By wiring it to Coinbase, then transferring it over.
Want to know why I'd have my business invest in bitcoin rather myself personally?  Because that way I only get raped by the IRS/State once, rather than twice.
And is it illegal?  Absolutely not.  My business is 100% allowed to buy "property" which may appreciate/depreciate in value and then be sold for a profit or loss.
Yes, the banking system is horrible.  Mostly because of consolidation and the idea that being a small bank making an honest living servicing customers isn't good enough, so we need to grow / acquire / sell out to become a big bank with big bureaucracies who only service our profits and the customers are just the inconvenience we have to put up with to get paid.

In theory yes.  But in practice you have trading costs and spreads.  The more volatile the underlying and less efficient the hedge, the greater the spreads.  I expect to see large spreads in the futures market during periods of volatility,and even larger spreads on any options on futures that may be traded.
Plus, market orders are taker orders both on GDAX for example w/ taker fees, and also on the CME w/ spreads.  And per contract fees.   So a seemingly clean arb turns into a "maybe I beat the costs maybe I don't" scenario pretty quick.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:07:52
Honestly, to have just sold 25% of your BTC to buy BCH would have been a *reasonable* hedge on the FUD BCH.  
(I mention this because similar fork battles may be waged in the future (and BCH may yet ultimately prevail over BTC), and when you can't see clearly which fork will win, but you are still convinced that BTC is the future, the simple answer is to own both.)
***Except that you already DID own both, so you had ZERO risk to the flippening, so therefore, I call shenanigans***
I have serious doubts that, already holding both, you made said trade.  This smells of a shill/agenda/fake news post.

Shouldn't?  Based on what, sheer entitlement?
Housing prices snatched 60% of grandpa's earnings too.
But instead of whining about it, grandpa scrimped and scraped and saved up enough for a down payment and bought a modest house.  From then on, his housing cost no longer went up lock step w/ inflation, and every year after that, his cost of living raise improved his life just a tiny bit each year.
Many years later, they would treat themselves by going out to eat twice a week, instead of only going to the early bird brunch special after church on Sunday.  Oh, and they splurged on cable TV.   Although it was almost as prevalent as today in the late 80's, I never even had cable TV until maybe '96 or so.
Grandma used to tell a story at family get togethers about how, when they were first starting out and trying to make ends meet, they used to get a chicken every week at the market.  ONE chicken.  For the week.  First day, roasted chicken.  Second day sliced chicken sandwiches.  Third day, pick the meat off the bones and make creamed chicken sandwiches or chicken pot pie.  Fourth day, boil the bones and have chicken soup, Fifth day, left over chicken soup.
One week, the dog got hold of the chicken and was running around the yard with it.  She called her mother in tears becuase she was going to have to tell grandpa they had no chicken that week, and would have to eat rice and beans and whatever canned goods they had left. Her mother (great gramma, tho I never met her) told her 'You don't tell him a thing.  You take that chicken in the sink and you scrub the hell outta it.  Then you cook it just like nothing ever happened'
If grandma and grandpa had just bought whatever they wanted rather than sticking to their budget and saving what they needed to buy a house, why, they'd be just like people today, crying about how the man is keeping them down and how unfair it is that they can't have the things they think they should be entitled to.
Grandpa didn't win the IQ lottery.  He was a regular guy who worked at a utility as union lineman.  He didn't win any money, or get any handouts.  He was lucky enough to be working in the post war exapansion when union jobs were reasonably available, but even then, it was clear who was working class and who had money.
I try to remind myself from time to time to mine the lessons from grandmas life about what's important, what's a need, and what's just a spoiled want.  I'm glad this thread gave me an opportunity to revisit and refresh my perspective.

That's extremely overreaching.  The recipient has met BOA's scrutiny to send and receive USD funds.
Chase is notorious for asinine overreaching borderline incompetent BS they pretend is perfectly normal.  
It's one of the reasons I refuse to do business with them.  I ended up sending a letter to all of my tenants telling them I would no longer accept checks from Chase.  I did this because Chase won't cash the check, they only let me deposit it, but they also won't guarantee the check so if I do deposit it, and it's NSF, I get pounded in the ass with fees, which is why I walked across the street to Chase to CASH the fucking thing rather than run it through my bank account in the first place.  Chase wants to be absolutely certain they get to fuck their customer with fees, and in the process make sure my bank gets to fuck me too.
Just because the jackasses at chase claim something, certainly doesn't make it true. Now if every bank, or even the majority of banks, and making these noises, then maybe there's something to it.   But I send and receive substantial wires from, ahem, another bank, and they don't ask any questions because they know ME, their customer.  The counter parties to my transactions are the responsibility of THEIR bank, not my bank.

    Disability paid by an insurance company for lost wages, loss of limb, loss of sight (etc.) may or may not be taxable, depending on circumstance:
    If the premiums were paid by your employer and were not included in your taxable income, the disability is taxable.
    If you paid the premiums out of your own pocket or with payroll deductions that came out of your after-tax income, the disability is not taxable.
    If you and your employer jointly paid the premiums, only the disability amount covered by your employer's payments are taxable.

The reality is that traders / Hedge Funds could (but can't legally and yes the SEC really is watching) manipulate small caps and issues w/ low trading volumes. Traders / Hedge Funds  couldn't manipulate large market cap issues w/ significant trading volume, even if they wanted to.
Most large institutional investors have position size limits built around avg daily volume, both to protect themselves from being unable to get out if the market moves fast against them, and also to protect markets from being impacted directly by their trades, which would usually break any number of law and regulations, and if maybe technically legal, would still attract scrutiny and nobody wants to deal with that kind of grief.
The SEC/feds are very much invested in making sure the markets are fair and accessible to small investors, and that they are not disadvantaged just because of their position size.


And This is where you categorically and irrefutably capital P **prove** you are clueless.  Closing a short position absolutely CANNOT cause a SELLOFF, because you have to buy some thing to close a short position.  jeeesus h christ.

Take someone who has worked 30 years as a laborer and has sacrificed their body for some kind of savings... and confiscate their life savings based on some bogus and exploitive crap.
You better damn well hope they are either a complete coward or that they have some other real good reason to keep on living... because if not, you just created a ticking time bomb, one with your name written on it.

This has everything to do with cryto currencies in general, as seizure is much harder.
Police:  Are you carrying large quanitities of crypto cash in your vehicle?  Driver: lolz
If you don't trust the government to not unjustly seize or freeze your assets, leaving them in a fed connected banking system is not an option either.  Ironically, his irrational paranoia just became 100% justified, no tinfoil hat required.
Honestly, this is also an excellent example of why you NEVER, EVER, talk to the police.  
Never answer questions, never let them in your house, not even for a coffee, never let them in your car, and never consent to a search of your person or bag, no matter how much you "know" you did nothing wrong.
And that's in the US, the supposed land of law and order.
Imagine in some turd world shithole where your required bribe is adjusted based on how much money you are perceived to have.  
This is why it's relevant to crypto/bitcoin.

So you mean like 1965 to 1985 then.  15% mortgage interest, market returned just about zero.  Gotcha.  Great time to hold onto that -15% returning mortgage "investment".
I can't say what exactly someone else should do with their investments.  I wouldn't presume.  But for the record, nobody can "lose" money paying off a mortgage.  The absolute worst they can do is "make less" money than they maybe could have otherwise.
I'm all for holding bitcoin.  I bought an assload and I'm not YET looking to sell.  I hope you make out like a bandit, as we're on the same side of this trade.
HOWEVER, when I can pay off my NYC mortgage (an amount you probably think is well over the moon and halfway to Mars) you can bet I'll be thinking long and hard if I should really leave "risk on".  Maybe I will.  Maybe I won't.  I already have other investments that more than pay my mortgage every month, so maybe I won't feel the need to pay it off w/ BTC profits..
But if the BTC was the *only* investment I had, I can guarantee you I'd have already taken profits several times along the way.

Cringy [sic illiterate] is being a corporate drone with your head up your ass apologizing for corporate incompetence with inane nit picky arguments that completely, though intentionally, miss the point.  
for example: it is the account holder's money to any extent that it matters, as it is held on their books as a liability owed to said account holder.  They are not allowed, for example, to place it into risky investments in the accounts holder's name.
for example: Loss Prevention works, either directly or indirectly, for the CEO/Executive Management.  Why would I write a letter to the clearly retarded Loss Prevention AVP?  the hope is that someone at a higher level would be suffering from slightly head-up-ass impairment and would care enough to dig into wtf is going on with those people.  I know the odds are slim, but including the OCC does tend to get at least attention, if not results, because every complaint to the OCC requires a written response from the bank.  
So if they can ELI5 for the OCC, then fine, they get a pass.  But if not?  Potential hell to pay.
Cringy [sic] indeed.

In my limited understanding, contango is the time value of the contract, and is represented by r, y, q, and u.
Backwardation is when the future is less than the spot, or the near month is less than the far month, and generally could be used to calculate a u which is negative.  A negative benefit to holding the underlying.  I think volatility is implied in the u as well.
So when rolling (long) contracts, you sell a near contract w/ little time value and buy a far contract with more time value, and each time you book a little loss, relative to just holding the underlying.   For commodities, who the the hell can "hold" 1mm barrels of CL crude oil?   
But for futures on *tradeable* financial instruments, they should be converge on u = 0 through arbitrage, leaving contango based only on r and q (risk free rate + expected dividends)
My take.  Certainly not a commodities expert though.

Traders can manipulate small caps and issues w/ low trading volumes.  Traders can't manipulate large market cap issues w/ significant trading volume.
Further your implication is that the billioniares are scalping each other, which is also pretty far disconnected from reality.
And when they take profits, its not "short selling", it's closing a long position.  And BTC futures will be cash settled, so no need to sell off positions just before expiry to avoid taking physical delivery. edit: Just let them expire and settle to cash. And they've already been settled to cash daily as part of the clearing cycle in the 45 min window when trading is closed.
And usually futures traders don't close positions before expiry, they "roll forward" the contracts (sell near month, buy far month) which is why you end up with contango loss if you use futures to simulate a long position in the physical.
Really, you *appear* to have no understanding of the actual mechanics of how the markets work, and are basing your entire understanding on "Trading Places", a movie that was made 30 years ago, dealt with inside information about unreleased crop reports, and was farcical even then.
Yes, when everyone sells at once and nobody is buying, you get a crash.  But that is not a billionaire taking advantage of the market.  The traders/billionaires are usually smart enough to sell into demand while it's still rising.

depends on location and tax load.
Take $4m, drop $1m on a house, paid cash.  You now have $3m.  Invested in a balanced portfolio you can expect average 6%-8% income / returns.  8% growth beats 5% dividends, because capital gains.
So you are living on an income of 6% of $3m, or $180k / year.  more in good years, less in bad ones.
If inflation makes that worth half what it is today, you're living on roughly $90k in today dollars.
If you believe that real estate inflation will outpace your investment, then you should own it sooner.  If you think tax sheltered investments will outpace real estate, then you should wait and buy it later.

I think about this sometimes, but when I think about the home my grandparents supported on one income, it is very much different than the home two incomes are supporting today.
Basically, it covered a mortgage on a MODEST house in a working class neighborhood, a car every 7-10 years, gas to get to work, and groceries that they cooked at home (to supplement what they grew, froze, and canned from their garden).
Using that metric, a single income today isn't that far off the mark.
The big difference isn't the inflation of basic needs outstripping wages, the big difference is the huge shift in delusional expectations people have as to what constitutes basic needs.

Basically, the catch is that there is RISK in this strategy.  Short the crap out of BTC and watch it go up 30% in 1 day.  Oops.
Ok, go long a big position... and watch it go down 30% in 1 day.  Oops.
The CBOE margin requirements will be 35%.  That means if you go all in on a long OR short position, a 35% movement against you will wipe you out.  As in forced liquidation, and you now have ZERO dollars.
Also, 4. Traders close their short positions.  You close a short by buying.  If the short was big enough to move the whole market down, then closing will also be big enough to move the whole market up.
The traders are counting on the market to move so they can make their profit.  This means up for long or down for shorts.  The traders are not trying to move the markets themselves.

Most Important Point:  Big investors know its easier, much easier, to go with the trend than against it.
Old sayings that describe shorting against an uptrend (or buying against a long trend:  
* Picking up nickels in front of a steam roller.  
* Catching Falling Knives.  
Markets can be trended or oscillating, and they go through regime shifts.  Further, different time horizons will give dramatically different perspectives on regime.

research :thumbs up:   fair enough.  i at least triggered you to dig through the numbers and think it through carefully.
now back to the present time real world, i have sufficient net worth to pay off my mortgage yet i dont because the money is better off invested. 
however, i will be paying off the mortgage as i get ready to clock out, because all investments are volatile and once i have walked away from w2 paychecks, there is really no going back except tail between the legs for like half the pay.  so i will make sure that absolutely wont have to happen.
so in a risk on regime. i agree with you that mortgage makes... sense so long as there is excess money coming in and ways to better invest the money.  risk off, its time for that large monthly expense to go away.
lesson from one of the old timers on wall st:  you can’t beat the sharp ratio of a paycheck.
and once you dont have a paycheck, every debt retired is really like a paycheck.  zero volatility in debt payments, infinite sharp ratio negative return.  penny saved penny earned.

35% is very high for the futures markets... but considering BTC can trade that range in a single day, it's maybe not high enough!!!
35% margin, it means you will have to have 5 x 15,000 x 35% = $26,250 in your account to buy one CME contract @ 15,000.  Or $5,250 to buy one CBOE contract.  And you'll need to send in more if BTC goes down in order to maintain the 35% margin requirement.
By comparison, you can buy eMini contracts w/ $4,500.  An emini is 50 units of the SPX (@ ~2635), or roughly $131,000 exposure.  IOW, spx contracts are margined at roughly 3.5%.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:09:56
Actually you do borrow shares, through your broker, who then has to go out to a security lending network.
The reason this works is because any security held in a margin account *requires* you hypothecate it back out for lending.
In a short squeeze, a classic way punish the shorts is (was?) to transfer your shares to a cash account (non marginable, non hypothecated), which would revoke them from any lending that maybe in effect.
IRA's and 401k's are cash accounts. No margin. I'm not sure about mutual funds, but I think the shares they hold are also not available for shorting. Therefore, some percentage of shares are held not shortable.  By revoking the shorts, you are forcing them to cover, driving the price even higher.  Then you can sell your long position from your cash account, hopefully punlishing them for shorting against you.

Clearly inflation is a systemic incentive to do something more productive with your money than stuff it under your mattress.  If calling that theft gets you nice and hard, well that's your business.  
But I personally find that in any government policy, there will be winners and there will be losers, and the losers will always scream about what money, rights, advantages or whatever is being "stolen" from them.  Calling policy theft only shows that you are incapable of truly understanding the complexities of setting policy to improve the greater good.
I personally find 2% inflation is a lot less harmful to me personally than cumulative 50% fed/state/local/sales/school tax rates.
But then I'm more interested in enjoying the fact that I have a functioning economy and a stable society in which I can make a living than I am in whining about how some secret cabal is stealing 2% a year in value from the $500 I have stuffed in my underwear drawer.

also: leverage.  
(If you buy a CME contract at 15,000, you need $37,500.  If BTC goes to 25,000, then you get 25,000 - 15,000 x 5 = 50,000 on 37,500 cash = ~150%)
downside is, if btc goes down 40-50% from 15,000, even if it rebounds intraday!, you are likely to get liquidated and lose the entire 37,500.

Also, he made billions using... wait for it... other people's money. And he's also a really insanely smart guy.  You and I, not so much.  For one thing, if you can't do the math on the value proposition of owning at 80% of the (all in) monthly cost of renting, plus the inflation hedge of fixing the payment at today's dollars for the next 30 years until it's paid off (taxes still go up very year so are still under hedged for inflation though) then I'm not sure what to you tell you.

Not because index funds are the best possible investment.  Rather because human nature and our natural cognitive biases makes it real effin hard to beat the index funds, and the cost of losing is way more than the benefit of winning incremental to index funds.

Well, honestly, pretty much *everywhere* else.  Or at least everywhere w/ a population &lt; 1M, and not in California.
Once you exclude housing (and trendy crap nobody actually needs), most of 'merka pretty much costs the same.  Walmart, Target, Costco, Toyota.... all about the same.
And if you bought a house w/ a HOA, then I guess it sucks that you bought three mortgages (MTG+HOA+TAXES) instead of two (MTG+TAXES).  Sorry for your loss, but hey, keeping up w/ the Joneses is worth having an extra mortgage you can't ever pay off.  Right?

Am I the only one who has always assumed the chinese miners have been stealing electricity all along (either by bypassing the meters or by bribing the power operators).
And with the latest effort to move hash rate away from btc, perhaps Wu is taking this opportunity to squeeze everyone "else" in china to take their hash power offline?
Because one I thing I imagine is that large criminal/grey operators tend to isolate their operations so that farkups/take downs of the less clever don't leak into their space.
dumbass B shows off his mining setups to someone, who in turn leaks to reporters, who in turn report it.  Dumbass B self destructs, but since wu is isolated, it just leaves his market/capacity available for wu to take over.
And who's to say wu didn't engineer the enforcement activity?

I'm ok with this because it means that the futures will remain vulnerable to the underlying more than the underlying is vulnerable to the future.  During trading, movement in one contra/absent movement in the other will trigger arbs to buy one and sell the other until the prices converge.  CME trades a 23h day, closing for a brief settlement period each day at 4pm (chicago time?).  So barring a CME trading halt, they remain correlated by the potential for arbs.
The CME circuit breaker is really protective of bitcoin only... as it leaves futures contract holders with their pants down and bent over in front of the train which is already moving full steam when the breakers kick in.

When considering any highly volatile investment in a runaway train that you fundamentally want to own (ie, not trading)...
Put 1/3 of $$ in immediately, regardless of price.
Choose a point where you are willing to put in another 1/3 and set a limit order (either as an actual order, or as a price alert)
Hold 1/3 of $$ on hand (maybe in QQQ or something that can be liquidated and wired over immediately) that you can use to buy a major crash.  When buying during a major crash, make sure the narrative and fundamentals are still one you want to own (think AIG / BOA in 2009 vs YHOO in 2001).
When a new "block" of $$ comes in, split it into the same 3 buckets.
In my world, "saving" is how I accumulate large enough "blocks" of capital to make "investments".

More likely it will just be a fiat loan, with spot trades at settlement.
Closing price of $238,125 requires 31.75 btc at settlement ($7500 usd/btc).
Buyer brings 20%, as 6.35 btc which is transferred to seller at closing.
Bank brings $190,500 to settlement. Mortgage is USD.  $190,500 is wired to seller (or direct to exchange f/b/o sellers account).
Seller wires USD to exchange, spot trades $190,500 to 25.4 BTC, and transfers to wallet.
If seller really wants to be a dick, he can require the 190k be escrowed by bank on an exchange ready to spot trade... but i expect most banks won't be flexible enough to accommodate.

So jump through the hoops and do the wire transfer.  My bank comps the outgoing wires, and coinbase rapes me for a whole $10 to receive them (vs multiple pct on credit card and ach transfers).
Once the wire hits and is processed (&lt;24 hours the last two times), you can trade limit orders on gdax (coinbase's internally ledgered exchange) w/ no cost (market orders incur taker fees).
Also, once the wire hits, request higher account limits from coinbase.  Reason?  "Because I have more money than that.  duh!"  They grant the increases.

You described swaps (CFD / cash for difference), not futures.  I think.  I'm really not sure exactly what you described, I just know it's not a commodity futures contract.
For a hedgeable future, contracts are generally trading at spot + time value of money + expected cash divends - cost of storage - cost of transportation.
For an unhedgable future, like the VIX, it is a pure bet on expected value at expiry.  Which is why VIX futures are discounted/damped by the volatility of the volatility (kindofa second derivative concept).  IE, a 60 VIX won't likely STAY a 60 VIX for 45 days to expiry.  So you can't sell anyone a contract for a vix  45 days from now for 60 vix-points.

It's not just matching, a lot of orders are now algo orders (computer algorithms that for example buy on GDAX and sell on Bittrex, and wire the USD back to GDAX), and those orders can simply be pulled at any time.  When the algos see "market selling" they can simply cancel the buy limit orders ahead of it.
But a true large market order will be matched and executed faster than they can react and pull.  As a person at a keyboard, always make sure you are 100% willing to execute any limit orders you put in.  Don't try to play with game theory by showing a buy wall or a sell wall you intend to pull before it gets there... because a true market order can wreck all your fun.

Good on you!
When people ask me how much bitcoin they should buy (and when they should sell)... I just dont even know what to tell them.
So I tell them what I am trying to do.
My goal is to accumulate 1/10 of my mortgage in bitcoin.
I see it as a 50/50 casino bet (roulette wheel RED) w/ an asymmetric 10:1 payout.  I either get mortgage payoff money, or I lose it all.  Anything in between is market noise.  Maybe it takes a year, maybe it takes 15 years.
(As an aside... scaling it to the mortgage balance is telling in another way... if pissing away an amount equal to 1/10 of my mortgage would lead to financial ruin, then I am probably way too leveraged in my house relative to my income.  I have bought way more lifestyle than I can afford and am living way beyond my (low risk) means.  If housing has gone up considerably since I bought in (and I bought more than 3 years ago and can take up to $500k LTCG tax free), I should consider trading down into a less expensive house and using the increased equity from selling tax free to greatly reduce the mortgage on the less expensive house)
Anyhow, my goal is to accumulate that much, buying in blocks, and then to have enough cash (or reasonably liquid capital) reserved to buy massively more in the event of a crash.  Say mortgage is $100k (scale to your own situation).  Own $10k now, say 1btc). But have $10k available to buy a crash.  Maybe 1btc at $5000 and another 3.3btc at $1500.  Maybe even another 5btc at $1000 if you have the capital.  And if it ever sees those prices again.  Nobody really can predict.
But NOT your life savings, nor all your investment capital.
So OP, you have achieved the goal.  You own the house, no debt.  Life will look different going forward.  You can spend much less time doing what you have to do, and much more time doing what you choose to do.  Don't quit your job, but do make sure that the job you have is what you "choose to do for money".

The seed is a method for recreating your private key.  Your private key is like a realllllly looooong password to your entire holdings.
If someone gets the seed, they don't need any further access anything of yours.  they can recreate/duplicate your private key and then use it to transfer all of your holdings irreversibly.
Write it on a piece of paper?  Anyone who sees it can use it to steal everything, at any time they please, from anywhere in the world.
Lose it?  If you have a hardware wallet, the you can still access your "account".  Lose the hardware wallet, AND lose the seed, then you have "lost" everything in your account and there is no way to fix it.

When the CBOT breakers cut off trading in a commodity contract like sugar, coffee, corn or gold, it stops the movement of the spot, because the spot is (mostly) traded through the futures contract.
But for the CME to have a trigger on eminis (SPX) would be silly, because the futures don't set the price for the SPX, the SPX dries the price for the futures. (mostly).
So really, I think the breakers on any BTC contract are really pointless, and introduce unnecessary risk to the futures contract holders, and are probably there as a placebo to placate the regulators and the BTC community more than for any effectiveness they actually have.

You should talk to a financial advisor.  the answer to your "what to do" depends on a lot of variables. Age?  Income?  Risk Tolerance? Expectations?  
I personally loooove rent producing real estate, especially unlevered.  up market, down market, rent comes in.  Worst market, I just lower the rent until I get them rented.  AS long as I rent above hard costs (ie property taxes, insurance, and maintenance) I never take a loss.
So much so that I struggle to stay diversified outside real estate.  I love my rent checks too much!!!!

Unfortunately NFX can't attract investments from common folk either, as commodities trading requires an account separate from a normal margin equities/options account.  I think it's like the CME that way.  unless the regs for commodities trading has changed in the last few years.

It's easy, *too* easy,  for the MBA lips to move and guarantee six sigma uptime.  
It's harder, a *lot* harder, for the actual promise to be executed.  
This is true not just in IT, but everywhere in life where you have managers motivated by self interests proclaiming the perfection "they" will deliver, then making actual delivery be someone else's problem.
However, in IT it is much more obvious when things go to crap as the whole world notices and points it out immediately.  Compared to say Toyota, where failing to execute on the quality promises made by management takes months or even years to become apparent.

Oh everyone can, *and will*, do it, whether they want to or not. The question is how will it impact their life? If they are prepared, and they opt out of work, then it is freedom and life is probably good. If they are not prepared and never opt out of work, *eventually work will opt out of them.*  This is when it can be devastating.  They may have to eliminate all luxuries and optional spending in order to just pay property taxes and utilities and buy food.  They may lose their house and have to move in with their children, or worse not be able to maintain the house and descend into a life of subsistence and poverty and decay, living with nothing, eating whatever scraps they can find or buy with social security, and living in a house that is falling down around them.
I buy and fix houses to rent... and I recently inspected a relatively large portfolio of houses and apartments that had been accumulated at tax sales and were now for sale because the owner no longer wanted to operate and/or restore them.
And it was very very (VERY VERY) depressing.
About 1/2 of the units were "functional but wtf".  Things like shower walls made from stapled up plastic sheeting, showers that operate with a rubber hose stuck over the sink faucet, kitchens with hot plates.  These were occupied by what appeared to be chronically unemployed groups of people spanning multiple generations.  I saw 5 to 10 (and sometimes more!) people in each 3 br unit... at 2pm on a Tuesday.  The life they were living was just shocking.  10 people sharing a single bathroom with a makeshift shower in a 3 br apartment.  Interestingly, the ethnic makeups of most the groups was pretty diverse, white, black spanish in the same unit.  It seems when the struggle at the bottom is real, people band together as best they can and I observed more grouping by economics than by race.
The other 1/2 of the units had been occupied by the prior owners until they either died, or until they failed to pay their property taxes and were evicted by a new owner after a tax auction.  But the condition of the properties was just absolutely unbelievable, considering that someone had been living there and I was seeing it pretty much as they had been living.  Roofs were leaking, porches had collapsed, stairs were loose or missing, floors were buckled and bare, clothing was ancient, broken windows were "boarded up" with cardboard and tape, plaster ceilings and walls had fallen, plumbing was minimal and crude, bathing accomodations were rustic, even heat was sometimes limited to a coal stove in the middle of the main room.  And this in NE US where winter is real.  These looked worse than a lot of abandoned properties... except they were still occupied right up until the tax sale.
I describe this because **THIS IS THE END GAME** for people who don't or can't or won't keep it together and manage to create a lifestyle that can be sustained from their investments and social security.
Spend lightly and save aggressively my friends.

tl;dr - FAKE FAKE FAKE.
So let me make sure I understand exactly what happened here.  You have managed to save up $300k which is no trivial task, yet you have zero knowledge about getting large commercial international deliveries of electronic products through customs in your country, you have zero business sense that would know that customs and imports are always a complicated issue, yet you blindly order a very large shipment of product, and it is somehow the shippers fault if the product was seized by customs, stolen by customs (entirely likely in far too many countries), or just rejected by customs.
Why the fuck didn't you buy, oh I dunno, ONE fucking s9, get THAT delivered and working, then order, ohhh let's say 10 more, and THEN knowing that you can get 10 at a time, just place 9 more orders for 10 units each, once after the other.
Or better yet, fly your ass to china and take delivery and then personally ship them to yourself with an insured carrier like DHL?
I personally think that NOBODY who has accumulated $300k is stupid enough to actually do this, stupid enough to not drive his ass down to customs and deal with the import issues.... this is almost certainly FAKE.

this may have beneficial tax consequences for traders and not be beneficial for holders.
commodities are taxed at 60/40 long term vs short term capital gains
edit: ~~On further review, I don't this applies to cryptocurrencies, rather it applies to *futures* on cryptocurrencies. CFTC is only interested in the futures exchanges and trading which they regulate.~~
edit edit:  HOLY SHIT this is broad and does apply to currencies directly.  This is actually really really important, as it opens the door for the CFTC to claim the right to regulate tons of crap well outside its current scope.  Imagine for example, that the CFTC announced that you cannot trade in CORN w/o being CFTC compliant.  Any local grain cooperative is now potentially subject to whatever action the CFTC may attempt to impose based on them trading in commodities.  Local pawn shop buying and selling gold?  Same deal?  Is everyone going to have to register as a money services business now?????
QUOTE:  At issue in the case was whether the CFTC had the authority to regulate cryptocurrency as a commodity in the absence of federal level rules, and whether the law permitted the CFTC to "exercise its jurisdiction over fraud that does not directly involve the sale of futures or derivative contracts," according to the document.

this is true, for a few reasons. 1) btc is a hodlers paradise.  2) btc volume is spread across many exchanges each arbing against each other with bots, so some pct of the daily volume is x exch arbs.
3) mcd is traded nyse for most of its volume.  but it is in the spx so there is some arb volume for mcd futures and for spx futures and for etf trading.
but my point remains.  you dont go push a market order on etrade for large blocks.  you trade otc and let the otc market maker match the trade or work it to market through their pro trading desk.   the otc house will usually know how they will work the order and will give you a print at an up front negotiated price much better than you would get with a market order or even by going to market yourself, and then they work the order to the market for their own profit too.  win win.

And at contract expiration, most traders close near month, and open far month on the same contract, which has zero effect on any offsetting hedge.

Assuming you guess your way into a valid seed, you can guess yourself into a "new" wallet w/ no money in it.
But the odds of that are exceedingly small (due to checksums and word lists, figure *approximately* 1/(2048*2048) = 1/4194304... only slightly less infinitely against you as guessing someone's wallet with money in it, making your statement still more or less valid.
NOTE: each word represents 12 bits apparently (2048 words) so if the checksum is less than 12 bits and appears at the end, then you might be able guess one so long as you are guessing the last word too.  if however, the checksum spans two words, and/or does not appear at the end then it may be physically impossible to guess one by only changing he last word.  And if you are not also changing the last word, it may be impossible to guess one period.
I would have to go read the spec to really say for sure... but the short version is that, **no, you almost certainly did not guess a random wallet by pure chance**
