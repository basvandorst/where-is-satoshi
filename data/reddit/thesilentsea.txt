I made a withdrawal from igot a couple of WEEKS ago in which even then they were using the excuse of "we're upgrading our system" being very vague....I decided to nope out like last week and withdraw all my bitcoins after realising how fishy everything was around them, obviously lo and behold don't have them &amp; I log in and get this message. Seems convenient that after weeks of "upgrading their system", this "issue" how now conveniently popped up...
 
Looks like they are gearing up to run....

Thank - you for insulting me, for an innocent mistake.
Anyway, to the OP, looks like igot moved their operations out of Australia, most probably because of the GST, I look into their terms and conditions, they run out of the UK now under a company called Beaumont Ventures to memory, so maybe chase them up in that direction through the authorities there. 
Good luck.

Just file a case with the AFP (Australian Federal Police) and tell Rick you are going to do that. The AFP should chase that up.
