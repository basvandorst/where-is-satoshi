Only heaven knows, everything was happening so fast it didn't even record a lot of shut. Definitely saw the 19.9, but the candle only goes to 19.3

Korea is trading BTC  - RISE AND SHINE MOTHERFUCKER
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:29:15
transaction fees would be more than the BTC you're buying, so its useless.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:43
I saw the 19.9, but it was gone so fast it wasn't recorded by the candle for some reason 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:37
wtf, 20k within 10 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:45
looked at charts during my lecture, about to hit 17k. Close my laptop, walk home (i live literally next to the uni so it took like 5 minutes). Coming back, unlocking computer, 19.500, like WATTT
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:59:32
Yes, the fees skyrocketed, BTC is not suitable for smaller transactions rn. You could ofc still buy small amounts of BTC on coinbase, because they only move the coins internally

WE HIT 19 ON GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:52:18
what said, futures are a 0 sum game. Also, to be able to issue shorts, banks have to buy BTC first!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:54
$10 or one coin lol.
For starters use coinbase as it's the most accessible I'd say. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:44:40
I would be there if I traded my GigaIOTA in for BTC, but it's going way too well rn
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:55:12
GDAX/Coinbase has really low limits is the problem 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:56:28
because bitfinex takes ages to verify new users so everyone goes to GDAX/Coinbase when it's urgent
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:22:03
Nope, you can only buy in your local currency, like with my euros I can't buy the BTC/USD either - makes it impossible to arbitrage between the currency pairs
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:53:13
GDAX EUR/BTC is at US$14600
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:02
About to hit 15k when you convert GDAX EUR/BTC to USD
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:18:41
like $15k a week max and shit like that
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:57:43
decentralization makes it impossible to ban it. It's banned in China, do you think that stops them?
The US to the A just want to make some taxgains off BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:46
WTF, WE JUST SKIPPED 17 AND WENT STRAIGHT FOR 18
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:17:40
I have no idea TBH, they were trading IOTA  when we were at $5.5 - I just know the market is extremely secluded and you can't just arbitrage from other pages
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:04
Yeah, but mostly short-term
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:31:06
oh shit, if you calculate the GDAX BTC/EUR into USD, it's far over 14k already
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:34:31
nah, we had this one at 10k already. stale. next one.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:02
it would all be based on transaction fees in BTC, that's pretty much how it is already. You attach a small amount of BTC to every transaction and that makes people calculate them.

HODL BOYS HODL (or even better, buy up what all those newbies are selling now)
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:01:12
I just remembered you can 3.3 margin trade on bitfinex as well, only problem is that verification for fiat takes ages, but other than that the platform works really well. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:09
Yeah, had the same problem during the last days, transfered everything to bitfinex
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:34
BITCOINS ARE ON SALE BOYS
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:19:21
Don't margin trade, you will eventually go broke.
Kraken offers margin trade, but their side has completely gone to shit
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:30
That's why you don't leverage.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:11:07
Oh fuck, thank you! Didn't know that I could still transfer my funds. Daaaaaaamn
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:10:43
All my fiat is sitting at coinbase and those fuckers decided to take their trading offline for the last 7 hours or so
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:47:45
You can find various versions on redbubble. No idea how they can keep selling it, as it clearly infringes on Nike's IP
