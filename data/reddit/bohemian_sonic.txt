Very interesting read. Since I am gradually becoming a supporter of the idea of cryptocurrencies, I always like to see what the opposition thinks, just to make sure I haven't become some irrational fanboy. However, the opposition in this article seems really weak. Not planning to refute each premise, but one thing I have noticed a lot recently:


The financial world likes to portray Bitcoin as a commodity. However, a commodity needs to have some commodity value. Also, don't commodities need to have a secondary purpose to just being a financial instruments (wheat, pork bellies, crude oil)? So what is the commodity value of bitcoins? The electricity needed to create all those 1s and 0s? Like other fiat money, their commodity value is as close to zero as possible. And yet it's seen as a commodity. Do they do this out of ignorance or intentionally because it is a possible threat to their business as usual?
Also, TIL:


I don't know the AML practices in the US, but this seems oddly high for a mostly digitized financial sector.

I am still new to Bitcoin, so honestly don't know; does one person have a lot of the bitcoins currently in circulation? Do we know how many?

strange as it may seem, that is the admirable thing about them; they are consistent in their pursuit of cutting costs, however bizarre it may seem at first.  As long as they get us from A to B by air and safely (so leaving maintenance checks, fuel reserves and so forth out of it), we will always come back for more, window shutters or not.

It's in the [Wiki article](


Edit: the video confirms this, but I too just noticed the error; paying != registered

So I just had to check it out and yup, you are right ([link]( I knew Ryanair is at the forefront of cost-cutting, but this is getting crazy. I would rather stand during the flight and pay for the use of on-board toilets then fly with such low fuel reserves.
