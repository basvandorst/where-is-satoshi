not really. When you set up a production line (i.e. Automotive), you make your first "series" prototypes with that line -earlier prototypes are made with other tools, because the line itself doesn´t exist prior to SOP (Start of Production).
Anyway, when the line is done, you still need to make "adjustments" in order to secure good quality products. So there is a period of time called Ramp Up. During this time, you move from 10 prototypes a day, to some hundreds, and in the mean time, you hurry to finish your changes because you are about to produce the real deal.
Ramp Up is finished, now your line is pumping out in the thousands...
short: Bitcoin is in Ramp Up phase.

Im new to Bitcoin, I have no idea what went wrong. The address is correct, I got a first message saying the transaction was on its way, but 60 minutes later and blockexplorer says it never happen, but my wallet is now empty  =(

thanks. So, lets say I loose my phone.
I buy a new one. I get a new wallet, the same one or from another party, who knows.
I have the encrypted key in my email.
I guess there is a place to import the file, then you are asked the password and "voila"??
My first thought is, the new wallet has a different address from my original one.
How does it works?
thanks again!

For Europe, Id recommend:
BTC-E for trading, and
Kraken for withdrawing your money.
I think in the US there is Coinbase...
Where do you plan to trade?

@_date: 2013-12-09 09:32:48
keep the finances separated... 
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:44:58
well, other currencies cant go completely obsolete, but following your idea, Id say that would be pretty awesome.
To go to war, you need to control the money. If money is in control of the people, well... world peace. (Hypothetically)

@_date: 2013-12-09 10:17:59
he is missing Kraken!!
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:54:49
I am still confused. With my wallet, I got an address. Then I generated new addresses to some other BTC from different people. 
Does my wallet has a permanent address, and some other temporally addresses?
And then, the private key is changing every time I do something with the BTCs??
thanks for the support!
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:23:11

which video games?
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:59:19
you know that in that sort of transactions, you should send 0.001 BTC maximum, so that you dont mind the looses.
Anyway, I am trying different wallets, and because of your comment, I will be avoiding the blockchain.info just in case.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:37:33
Im on Kranken now, it seems very friendly. Thanks man!
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:49:09


how/where do you change those for BTCs?
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:56:17
thanks again, it works sweet!
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:15:45
that is also war...
this is a Hypothetical scenario, so take my comments as Hypothetical  =)
to go to war, you must have the financial resources in full control. If you do not have money, you (as a government) must borrow...
But if the money is in control of the people, not centralized, and not in the reach of the authorities, then going to war would be almost impossible.
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:46:43
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:41:03
I say just text...  mBTC  or   BTC.

Where do I sign to get my Bitcoin Passport?
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:31:27
Not for me.
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:00:13
I invite you to research who controls the money. All wars are money motivated, but again, you need to control the financial resources.
Im not good at short explaining. I suggest you do a research in something like "who owns the money", "The Rotschild's", "financing wars"... it will take a while.
But again, if we trade money between civilians, without any banks making profit from it, they will have a very hard time to finance a war.
can someone help me explain this point?

awesome!
