Clearly you missed the sarcasm in my original post. I'm quite familiar with his body of work and do not think he can be considered any more (sorry) EDM than Gaga, Bieber, or other pop act. There's no shame in being pop or mainstream, but don't pretend like you got some underground cred because you have repetitive electronic patterns in your music. 
Oh, and enlighten me - if it's not EDM these days, what do you call it.

Dude, I've been listening to edm, techno, trance, or whatever masses want to call it probably before it even could be considered such. Shit, I remember when everyone called it techno and acts like Fatboy Slim were filed in that section of the Tower Records. 
I saw Armin and PvD rise over the years and chased them all over East coast before they became mega-stars (or as someone I know said: since they were banging on pots and pans). I partied in Twilo, Arc, and Limelight and I can tell you with full certainty that this clap-along pop would get booed by a line of clubbers if heard from a passing car; in a club? Someone wound get his ass PLUR'd.
I just fucking hate how this one thriving scene had been fucked by commercial whores who smelled big money. An act best described by one "legendary" SHM ~~fatman~~ frontman Ingrosso and [immortalized here](
So, to put SHM, Guetta, Afrojack, Avicii and alike on same level or in same category as J00F, M.I K.E., Solarstone, Hawtin, Sasha, or even Oakenfold and van Dyk is both silly and offensive...

Welllllpppp..  at least one of us knows how to spell the name of the "artist". Surprised it isn't you.

And since you don't, then you can? Sorry, I didn't get the memo. And if I was listening to Avicii, you'd be right - I'd have to call it "pop".

I'm a die hard edm fan for years and never heard of these folks. Are they manufactured superstars?
