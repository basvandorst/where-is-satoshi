huh, okay. But if every transaction uses a new address you're fine? Essentially

Is that the same as using a bitmixer? like bitmixer.io or Fog?

I realize that, but what I mean is that if they think a certain address has 1 BTC and then I transfer that to some other address, how would they know it's still me? Wouldnt they think someone else has it or at least have no way of knowing?

Okay, I understand that, but how does Chuck know that Mister X exists? what if mister X is just another one of Alice's addresses she created by clicking the "new address" button.

Okay I think I understand. Are the private keys spontaneously generated?
When I click the new address button is a private key generated somehow (how is that done?), which then generates a publick key, which then generates a public address?

But if every transaction uses a new address, what would make chuck think one transaction was mister x and one was just another or alice's addresses?

Wow, okay thank you both for the answers. 
I have a couple follow ups though. , you said that I have both a private and pubilc key? Essentially is the private key my "wallet" and the public address(es) all just connnected to that private key somehow? How are the new public addresses made and how do the coins know to go to my private key through that address? Is it possible to have two people with the same address?
And , you answered my second question beautifully, but to add to that, how would whoever is tracking me know that it's still me if I transfer bitcoins from one of my addresses to another?
Let's say I have a suspicious BTC that someone is tracking because it came from drugs, or something illegal (idk), If I transfer 0.43BTC to one of my addresses and 0.57 BTC to another, how would whoever is tracking me know it's still me who has them and not someone else?

How did this go to the wrong person? I'm confused
