I've been interested in getting a Switch for a while. Bitcoin doing great now so I went ahead and bought it.

 good luck.

Bought some games with it also, high prices at every retailer in sweden. I think this is the only tech one accepting bitcoin, at least from what I've found from a quick bit of research.

Lol, I have way to many good games on steam I've never touched. A lot of bundles. I still have 0.2BTC on my wallet. Won't buy anymore since my only source of income is that I'm a highschool student right now which is about 120$ a month.

[Double check, should be there.]( Might only be in Sweden you're able to use bitcoin.

I put down 2k$ on my own, 18yo student, it's been good so far but remember that it COULD go to shit.

Hold, don't panic. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:46:06
RemindMe! 180 days "expensive switch?"
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:21:32
What the fuck.

I bought in with 1.7k$ yesterday at 11400$/BTC, planning to hodl for 2months minimum, also 300$ in Ethereum and planning to hodl for 6months-2years.

It's a rick roll. He actually doesn't do it. Instead he'll donate 25BTC to charity.

There were around 300k unconfirmed transactions around Christmas. This is a huge improvement.
