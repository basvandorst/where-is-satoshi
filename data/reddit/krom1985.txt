Thanks all, good info.

Did this a month ago during the backlog :-D

I second this. Used them for my Bitcoin gold. I was worried for a while but a few days later the BTC landed in my account.

Bitcoin will stand or fall on its merits/limitations. BCH will do the same.

You do realise there's considerable capital flight restrictions in Korea right? I think it's $50k tops that can be sent out of the country each year without attracting close inspection.
Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:43:05
You're a gentleman and a scholar. Thank you good sir!
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:07:08
Which date do you want to start at? It doesn't matter really.
BCHers want their coin to supercede Bitcoin no? For that to happen, they would expect/hope that as Bitcoin activity reduces, BCH increases in a "flippening" type action, but that's not happening at all.
It is six months after BCH was launched too, yet price, hash rate, transaction volume and node count are all around 10-15% of Bitcoin. The irony is that Segwit is at a similar ratio yet that's considered a failure by the BCH community.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:55:28
Mwah, mwah mwaaaaaarh!
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:35:55
From those two links above:
Bitcoin has reduced by just over 40% since an ATH on 6th January (1.043M to 621,944).
Bitcoin Cash has reduced by almost 85% since an ATH on 20th December 387,694 to 66,471).
Whilst neither looks rosy and we're clearly in a correction period, BCH looks far more ominous.
I'd be interested to see BCH's figures if Antminer purchases were excluded.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:13:50
But what defines active? What timescale to the last transaction?
I'm just curious.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:58:15
Thanks. What defines an active address?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:19:11
There are people on here fome time to time that seem to be able to magic your transaction into the next block whe you send them your transaction ID. I don’t know how they do it, but keep an eye out on Reddit. They swoop in subtle!!
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:55:15
Cheers. I've been waiting a few days already. I was hoping that with the mempool dropping over the past few days it may have gone through.
Will keep my fingers crossed!

2-3 hours training doesn’t seem much for such a complex project/the proposed agenda.
I would have thought a master’s degree would be more appropriate to become a Bitcoin expert!
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:20:00
A combination of:
1. Increased hash rate mining blocks in less than ten minute intervals.
2. Bigger blocks due to Segwit/transaction batching from bigger players.
3. Lower volume than in the past couple of months.
4. People chilling because it's Sunday :-)

For Bitcoin Gold, you can use the Coinomi app to sweep your private keys, then either Changelly within Coinomi to swap to BTC, or you can send your BTG to Binance and swap for BTC there.
That’s how I got mine.

No I did not. I actually opened one with Coinomi (used their integrated platform). Coinomi said to contact Changelly so I gave up as it was over Christmas. Three days later the coins hit my BTC wallet.

Warning regarding bitoasis; their fees are high, and if you select the low fees option, expect it to take weeks for your transaction to be picked up. I use my UAE credit card on Coinbase then transfer out via GDAX.

No you get plenty enough from his free videos to start trading with. If you’re starting from scratch, I would advise starting with watching the charts and price swings to get a feel for it. Also check historical price action for context, and open an account on the Bitmex TEST environment to practice with before using any money in real trades.
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:34:42
Is that it?!
@_date: 2019-07-20 14:50:41

If people want to follow a legit Bitcoin trader, they should follow Eric Krowne and Krowne's Crypto Cave.
He trades the trend, not his opinion, and he's often clear on this.
He also trades using simple moving averages. Nothing fancy or confusing.
Watch a few of his videos  and see what you think.
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:02:16
You should back test to the 2011 at least.
You've then got three 'ATHs' in (2011, 2013 and 2017).
See what the peak ratio was for each, and use that to help project the next ATH. See what number you come out with.

He's miles better than the likes of Tony "hyperwave" Veys.
He's been living all over the world and makes his living through trading.
He shares his positions openly in each episode.
He provides free content that's very informative. He also provides paid content for those interested in becoming full time traders. He's been clear on that distinction in previous podcasts. Stick to the free shows if you're not interested in becoming a full time trader.
He hasn't sold me anything, so you're plain wrong there.

Never follow blindly and do what somebody else tells you to do.
Do your own research, and do what's best for you.
Take into consideration that we're not in 2011 anymore, and the kind of gains from the early days are no longer possible as each future halving has a decreased effect on price appreciation.

Honestly, I find his free podcasts extremely insightful without joining the paid course. I'm sure there's a wealth of knowledge there in the paid courses, but everyone who wants to trade BTC should be watching his videos. An impartial trader who trades the trend and the MAs, not his opinion. None of this Tony Vays hyperwave shit.

1. You don’t have to pay $5 fees.
2. The Lightning Network will handle micro payments.
3. Nobody uses bcash. Over half of its recent transactions were to and from the same address.
4. Bcash’s hash rate relative to BTC is low and has reduced over time since the fork in 2017. That makes the network less secure and transacting on it a higher risk.

Right, that's the thing.
Whether people like it or not, there's always going to be people who want to trade. The fella was asking whether Krowne's paid content was worth it. In my opinion, his free content is plenty enough unless you want to become a full time trader, which I'm not.
I also have cold storage, but trade with a small percentage (5%) of my stack as a hobby.
Good day to you!
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:00:43
He doesn't need to find suckers. He discloses his trades on his account. He does very, very well. Far better than you do I'm sure.
If he can make a bit of money on the side on top of his free videos, why not? Good for him.
If you engaged your brain and actually watched his videos instead of blindly repeating bollocks parrott fashion, you might do better for yourself too.
@_date: 2019-07-20 17:40:57
You can buy with your debit card I believe. I hear what you’re saying. Initial set up is a pain in the arse. Once you’re done though, payments can be made quickly. I still use Coinbase because I can have the coins in my wallet within 90 seconds.

Nice article. You might want to add a paragraph explaining that owning Bitcoin is as much a hedge against the current financial system as it is a speculative asset, as many people are treating it today. It’s not just about the value. It’s about it being a safe haven and unreachable by the establishment.

This won't be popular, but use your debit card to buy on Coinbase, transfer the BTC into your Coinbase Pro wallet, then out to your cold wallet from there for zero fee.
I do this every month and it takes no more than 10-15 minutes including initial confirmations.
It'll take perhaps an hour for initial set up in Coinbase and Coinbase Pro with card registering.
Then you're good to go.

What’s the point?
@_date: 2019-03-29 10:18:37
So less than inflation then?
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:12:23
There’s several industries/scenarios where I perceive blockchain to be useful:
1. Financial transactions/GL.
2. Legal contracts.
3. Supply chain management.
4. Electoral roll/voting.
Nothing beyond the above needs a blockchain to manage it. Traditional databases will do the trick for the rest.

There needs to be a service whereby you can automatically buy BTC to replenish whatever you spend. Perhaps linked through a bank account or card. That way, your BTC stack is protected as price appreciates.
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:19:54
Replace it the moment you use it.
That should keep your BTC account in check.

You’re going to have to be patient on this one. $0.07 is low. I waited a couple of weeks for one during the mad run in 2017.

That's the beauty of the difficulty adjustment. If miners switch off because it's no longer profitable, someone else will come along and start to mine again, using old PCs if necessary. There may be a temporary slowness on the network, but the difficulty adjustment will eventually compensate for that.

Too low. From bottom to top of the last bear to bull was about 200-20,000 (approx. 100x).
Taking into consideration the halving has a decreased effect over time, reckon a solid 20-30x from the previous bottom (~$3k) could play out in the next bull run. That would put us around 60-90k.

It’s quite simple: network consensus and game theory.
In two years since the fork:
BCH price vs. BTC: down
BCH hash rate vs. BTC: down
BCH transactions vs. BTC: down
BCH new wallets vs. BTC: down
All the above meaningful metrics/statistics point to Bitcoin being BTC. Despite this, BCH zealots continue to squat on the r/btc handle, and until recently the  Twitter handle, using those platforms to criticise BTC and post pro BCH, and also confuse new members of the community. If they went their own way and used r/BCH and  as their handles, I suspect that a lot of the animosity towards the fork would go away. As it is, they persist.

Not true. All it needs is demand to remain the same through a halving cycle for the price to double. The same community could continue to invest and the price would move up over time due to reduced rate of new supply.

Where was I calling for 8000s you mong?
It did and still does, have potential. Doesn't mean I think it will likely play out. You also have no idea about my position.
Halvings have less effect because of maths you thick waste of cum. There's fewer coins being taken out of the reward every halving (25, 12.5, 6.25 etc). Therefore the overall effect on supply/demand is lessened. It's not hard to understand is it? 
Who gives a flying fuck about your position? How do you know I'm not long?
Your kind of stupid moonboy post is part of the reason this sub gets ridiculed. You can hurt a lot of people with blind nonsense. I'm bullish, but it's critical to check your biases.

A difficulty adjustment would kick in that reduces the complexity of resolving each block. Therefore, less hash power/energy would be needed to mine each block. It then balances out the fees against the cost to mine.

Never use the order books to judge price movement. Buy and sell walls are often created to create the false perception of support/resistance, which get quickly pulled for the price to flow in the opposite direction. Buy/sell walls are often created to allow bigger actors to accumulate/distribute without price slippage.

I think there’s a balance to regulation and complete financial transparency. Why should the government know whether and where I’m buying my coffee from?
The actions outlined in the article could affect Bitcoin’s fungibility. If I don’t declare my wallets, and can’t spend my BTC in the manority of the economy because my wallet is blacklisted, then my coins are less valuable. Personally I think any legislation like this should be demonstrated against on a macro, multinational scale. A larger Occupy movement if you will.
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:08:12
But you have to rely on \*all\* governments to do this.
And there's too much incentive for governments to use it as a competing mechanism. E.g. if the US banned BTC exchanges, could you see Russia banning them? Or perhaps instead start mining BTC and promoting them? There is money to be made in the hardest money of all, particularly as the dollar plunges into oblivion.

We’re at transaction ATH yet the mempool (transaction queue) is 90% lower than the previous ATH in 2017. This shows that scaling through Segwit, wallet fee estimation, exchange transaction batching and Lightning are working. They will continue to be adopted.

Don’t panic, and use a wallet that lets you set the fee.

You're clearly incapable of cognitive thought. Yes there's less coins, I didn't dispute that. I said that \*the block reward reducing by smaller amounts has less effect on price appreciation\*. AKA, as Bitcoin matures, the price stabilises. What is so difficult to compute about that moonboy?

You're actually too stupid to debate with.
I halve 50 to 25. That's 3600 less coins rewarded each day. 3600 coins that no longer hit the market.
I halve 12.5 to 6.25. That's 900 less coins rewarded each day. 900 coins that no longer hit the market.
Now assuming demand stays the same in each case, the pressure on price is *less* in the latter scenario, because there's only 900 fewer coins rewarded each day compared to the 3600 in the first scenario. When you take 3600 coins out of the market per day, it has a more aggressive push on price than if you take 900 coins out of the market per day.
Is that really too difficult to understand?

TCP/IP is the protocol that drives the internet and information exchange. It was created in 1974. It has only supported widespread, commercial adoption since the introduction of smart phones in the mid 2000s and all the apps that come with them. That’s a thirty year lead time into mass adoption.
Bitcoin is ten years into its journey. Let’s see where we are in another twenty to twenty five years.
Not to say that Bitcoin will precisely mirror nor that it will be a guaranteed success. Only that it’s still early days for a technology that solved a thousand year plus problem.

@_date: 2019-02-20 20:08:30
It’s more about the hypocrisy of beating on Bitcoin mining as a high energy consumer, when fucking Wall Street is just as bad if not worse! Bitcoin is called out regularly for its mining energy requirements, and it’s only fair that people realise that this isn’t a problem unique to Bitcoin or any proof of work protocol.
There are already mining operations taking advantage of renewable energy setups. That being said, there is still a lot of work to do.
With respect to miners shutting down, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment is defined against the amount of hash rate on the network mining for block rewards. The difficulty adjustment ensures that blocks are mined every ten minutes. The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks to reflect the current hash rate. E.g. if there’s fewer miners and the has rate is lower, the difficulty to mine the block resuces in order to retain the ten minute block reward. If a large number of machines turned off at the same time, the amount of time to mine the blocks for the remaining machines would increase, until the 2016th block is reached, and the difficulty adjusts again based on the reduced hash rate.
Hope that makes sense.

@_date: 2019-08-03 12:27:43
You have it the wrong way around.
Halving will have less impact on price in the future.
The rate of new supply decreases less and less over time, and the new user adoption rate will decrease as the asset matures over time. Bottom to top, you’re probably looking at something like 30-50x this cycle, 10-20x next cycle, then 5x then 2-3x etc. The previous cycle bottom to top was approx. 100x

Couple of points:
Although there’s 21 million Bitcoins, each on is divisible by 8 decimal places, the lowest unit being widely known as a Satoshi. So even reduced circulation can be accommodated for.
The technology is still young, and we’re in price discovery mode. Once coins are more evenly distributed, the price will stabilise and be an effective medium of exchange. Those divisible coins could be the equivalent of 100s of trillions of dollars.

I suspect more people are using BTC today than people were using GPS and TCP/IP at the same point in its history. That's my point. The maturity of technology can take decades.

No, they don't. Your understanding of Bitcoin is flawed. It is a network protocol that allows the transfer of financial value without depending upon a third party to manage/mitigate. Bitcoin needs to be compared to TCP/IP or GPS. A comparison between Facebook and MySpace is miles off. Apps that are built and use the Bitcoin block chain to verify its own data, would be the equivalent of a MySpace/Facebook.
For a chain to come along and beat Bitcoin, it needs to have:
1. A greater network effect.
2. A longer, more reliable chain.
3. More hash rate dedicated to mining and securing the network.
4. No corruptible, manipulatable figurehead.
If a rival chain cannot do all of the above, then it's not going to usurp Bitcoin at this time.
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:52:28

Rubbish. There is a plan. It's just longer term, after other block optimisation features have been deployed. Big blockers are impatient "me me me now now now" types, that can't look beyond the next 12 months. This is a special technology, and it should be developed extremely carefully. Not at the whims of impatient fools.

Agreed. Where there’s money to be made, people will innovate, whether it’s solar panel farms, using water, wind farms etc.
The real evolution would be self sustaining miners whose heat output feeds back into powering the miner in a cyclical manner.
Should add to those questioning the energy wastage on maintaining the Bitcoin network, how much energy is being wasted in New Jersey, powering the HFT data centres that Wall Street use to rig the game in their favour?

Ignore the haters mate. Welcome to the club :-)
I know it isn’t very popular here, but I use Coinbase with a card I’ve registered on their site. I can buy within 90 seconds when I want it’s easy and very convenient. The fees may be a bit higher, but I don’t live wrapped in tin foil, and send my coins to a hardware wallet after purchasing.

Well, we had miners switching off at the end of last year as the market bottomed out. How did that affect the network security?
There's so much hash power dedicated to mining now, it's not cost effective for anybody to attack the network in a meaningful way. Even if the US government wanted to attack it, they would have to print money, which would hyperinflate the USD and bring the US economy crashing along with it. So it's not in their interest to do so.

Never trust the order book. Sell walls and buy walls are created to allow bigger players to buy and sell into.
This could quite easily be a big player trying to accumulate more at a lower price before pulling the wall and allowing it to run.
Opposite happens with distribution and buy walls to create the impression of demand to create liquidity to sell into.
Long story short, don’t trust the order books.

:-D You yanks and your myopic outlook on the world...
The dollar's place as the global reserve currency is dying. The fed had to print their way out of 2008, and they are going to have to print themselves away from another market crash, which will result in hyperinflation. At this point, kiss goodbye any control on a global scale. Your currency will be as useful as the Bolivar.
Smart cookies like Russia, China, Iran, Hungary and Belarussia are loading up on gold, and dare I say, Bitcoin, in preparation for this. Trump will keep the economy ticking along until his successor has to come in and deal with the mess. Fortunately for the rest of the world, America's laws do not apply to them. So even if/when the US bans crypto, other countries will end up adopting it as a navigation around any US applied sanctions.
If you're an American living in America, I would be worried about the long term outlook.

If it is supposed to be serious:
1. The use of the Euro  for all transactions was mandated from a set date.
2. TCP/IP (the protocol behind the internet) was developed in the late 70s/early 80s, making it almost 40 years old.
3. GPS was developed in the 70s for the US military, and is now helping to deliver your takeaway and taxis to you in the last 5-6 years.
Long story short, ten years is not a long time/old for a technology. The internet only really proliferated from 2009/2010 onward with the proliferation of social media, smart phones and global mobile network infrastructure.
I would be surprised if Bitcoin and crypto took another 15-20 years to really pick up the use case/use.

Assuming the blocks are even full, it will lead to more data storage required more quickly to store the blockchain history. Over time, this inhibits individuals from running nodes to secure the network, and leads to centralised data storage. This in turn is less secure.

It’s an alt coin that forked from the main BTC chain. In its own right as a coin, it’s any other alt. What makes people hostile towards it, is that bcashers have attempted to co-pt the Bitcoin ‘brand’ using the bitcoin name for a coin that forked away from the original chain.
You’ll see the bitcoin twitter account denouncing bitcoin and promoting bcash for example. Roger Ver, its controller, is a convicted criminal who lied publicly about the solvency of Mount Gox, the largest crypto exchange in 2013/14. He recently engaged in a hash war with fellow narcissist Craig Wright who claims he is Satoshi Nakamoto, yet doesn’t appear to be able to move any of the original coins despite many requests to do so. They are both greedy narcissists who should be treated with immense skepticism. There’s plenty of online material about them.

Bcash is a failed experiment. They tried to flip in November 2017 and failed. They’ve had over 18 months to flip BTC yet:
Price against BTC is down.
Transactions against BTC is down.
Hash rate against BTC is down.
New wallets against BTC is down.
Add to that their hash war which has fractured their community even more, and what are they left with? A failed experiment.

You’ve said yourself it’s very hard to time euphoria. So why buy high?
We’ve seen enough of these market cycles now to know where the bottom is roughly, and to know when to get ready to get out. Nobody knows how far things will go after passing the ATH. Point is that if you accumulate hard around the bottom, you’ll have plenty enough to make good gains.

Difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks to keep the average block time resolution around 10 minutes based upon the hashrate.
Therefore, as more miners jump on and the hashrate increases to solve blocks faster, difficulty increases. As miners switch off and the hashrate decreases making blocks longer to solve, the difficulty decreases.

This whole channel open 24/7 argument is bollocks. Your smart phone is connected to wifi at home and mobile data when out and about. So long as you’re connected, you’ll be able to keep a payment channel open.

The difference between Bitcoin and all the others, and will always be the case, is that Bitcoin has no leader, no CEO. This makes it almost impossible to corrupt, or to switch off.
Every other coin has a figurehead, a leader, someone who is ultimately corruptible given the appropriate circumstances. It's this that makes Bitcoin more secure than other coins, and why it will be coveted by those looking to secure their wealth in the future.
Lightning will give Bitcoin a chance to be the medium of exchange too. There are other players in this area for sure that could do things better, but in the long run, there will be 4-5 major coins like there are 4-5 big players in the internet (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram etc). Everyone else will be fighting for scraps. Bitcoin will remain one of the big 4-5 because of the first paragraph above.

I think before asking about Bitcoin, you need to understand the history of money, and how money is created from debt. Then take time to understand recent economic history (past 150-200 years) up to the present day. Search on Youtube there’s tons of videos on the topics.
Then you’ll understand why Bitcoin exists.

If you use risk management effectively, and are disciplined in your trades (i.e. cut losses early), then you \*can\* be successful with it, but no guarantees.
Most people who trade will also have a cold storage stack they don't touch, which is the majority of their holdings.
Personally, I trade with 5% of my total holdings. The rest stays cold storage.
I've made 33% on my trading stack since last December.
However, I've also lost over 1 BTC trading in the past when I was a stupid noob.
If you're an emotional person when it comes to money, then stay away.

BTC has:
The highest hash rate securing its network.
The highest number of transactions.
The higher price.
The more network nodes validating the network.
The greater number of users.
Based upon the above, the safest investment you can make is BTC.
BCH had two years to change the user sentiment and flip BTC, but has failed and has never been farther away. BSV is a joke coin with a fraud as its figurehead.

Just put your coins on a private wallet, throw it in the drawer and forget about it for 5-10 years. Ignore everything in the meantime. Don’t forget/lose your password/back up key!

@_date: 2019-09-12 06:07:46
Correct, however widespread adoption is yet to take off per the S curve, and will apply additional upwards pressure on the price once it does. We’re probably still 5-10 years away from that. After that, price appreciation would be in the same range as equities.
@_date: 2019-09-21 10:51:57
HAHAHAHAHAHA. Ridiculous comment.

Which programming language(s) have you learned?
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:44:52
You don’t have to go to college. Literally just search on Youtube. People aren’t going to spoon feed you. You need to do your own research. To your question though, I’ve never bought Bitcoin with USD. Same with others around the world. So how is Bitcoin dependent on it?
@_date: 2019-09-10 08:39:29
Damn, will have to stuck to 5-10x instead ��
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:17:30
What are we looking at?
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:36:20
This is my thought. Once Schnoor and Taproot are deployed, it’s a very different game.
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:58:26
Are you on drugs?
That doesn't even make sense.
If you're not worried about institutions suppressing the price, then more fool you.
And I'm saying that as a holder.

I bought on Coinbase two days ago and moved the coins straight off and into a cold wallet.
What's the problem?

Same with GPS. Developed in the 70s by the US military. Bringing your Deliveroo/Uber to you since around 2013.
This game is still early.
By the way, download Bisq and buy that way. Avoids KYC.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:51:01
You can't just make something "decentralised".
True decentralisation can have no figurehead. No CEO.
No other coin has that.
People have spent years putting their trust in "controlled" currencies. People are also becoming jaded with the political and economic status quo. Bitcoin is an opportunity for financial and economic freedom.
This will become even more important if hyper-inflation kicks in in the western world. It's already a saviour to people in countries like Venezuela, Argentina and Iran.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:44:58
Personal preference to be honest. I have a Trezor and it works great. Make sure your 24 word recovery seed is stored elsewhere in case you lose it.
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:42:47


That's the single, fundamental reason why BTC is, and will remain king.

It doesn’t need anybody else to discredit you.
You manage to do it well enough yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:58:13
All that matters is that the mempool is down 90% from Dec 2017 whilst transactions are at at ATH.
That is progress.
Once Schnoor, MAST and Taproot are deployed along with Lightning growth, bcash is going to be dead in the water.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:13:00
What? It's not even 2021 yet!
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:56:26
This is a shrewd way to look at the situation.
Also, Millenials are less likely to invest in a pension, more likely to invest in Bitcoin, and are less trusting of the political and economical status quo, as they grew up through the 2008 crisis.
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:15:10
You will, if you're willfully ignorant.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:54:07
Research Trezor, learn how to use one.
Buy one.
Also, how were you hacked? It’s good to share this so that others do not make the same mistake. It’s how the community learns and evolves.

April 2018.
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:16:20
Pal, 50% of bcash transactions over the past couple of weeks were to and from a *single* address. There was an article on it somewhere.
That should tell you all you need to know, and which horse to back.

It’s almost as if it was planned that way... :~)
@_date: 2019-05-06 16:43:00
lol I'm not suggesting anything FFS.
It's a legitimate concern.
Institutions coming in isn't necessarily bullish. They could just suppress the price like gold.
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:33:51
Listen to yourself to whiny little shit stain. Talk about triggered. You pathetic weasel.

@_date: 2019-05-25 19:52:36
No it looks like the typical “me me me now now. now” bullshit of modern society, instead of giving time for a network to grow and develop. Give it time instead of expecting instant gratification.
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:45:09
Yes, decentralisation. No other coin can provide that in the manner that Bitcoin does, because, well, Satoshi walked away. There is no corruptible, manipulatable figurehead or CEO. That is what makes Bitcoin so unique, and without compare.
@_date: 2019-05-02 03:09:24
If you have a bank/savings account, download Bisq and. Buy from there.
No KYC required.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:58:22
Coinbase doesn’t allow margin trading.

Lol what a twat the OP is ��.

Download Bisq and make a bank transfer. No KYC required.
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:05:27
It’s happening because people are confident that the bottom is in. People are front running one another to buy back in.
It’s FOMO.
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:33:09
Imagine how the price will react once the rate of supply is halved, yet demands triples...
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:04:17
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:40:33
Supply and demand.
The end.

There is no chain that can complete with BTC's network effect, hash rate and transaction rate.

If plankton like you start trolling newbies, expect to get eaten by sharks like me...
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:47:35
Bitcoin solved the 30 year old Byzantine Generals' Problem. It's the most important discovery in computer science of the past 30 years.
It provides the ability to communicate value and information in a trust-less manner for the first time ever.
It gives power to the people, instead of institutions.
If you can't be excited about the above, then...
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:23:25
Invest a quarter of your money once every two weeks over the next eight weeks. You’ll catch any meaningful retraces, and the price shouldn’t run away too much at this point either.
Breaking the mas to the upside has triggered a nice rally. It should consolidate for a while now.
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:49:48
Good for you and your entrepreneurial spirit!
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:51:40
I just call the cunts who aren’t helpful, cunts.
It’s cathartic.

Luckily for the rest of the world, nobody gives a fuck about what you think.
I'm supping a nice glass of wine by the sea, watching the sun set.
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:12:26
It was 3147 on Bitmex at its lowest.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:21:03
No worries.
When you see a resistance point hit multiple times, and the retrace forming higher lows as volume tails off, you know there's a potential big move upwards coming. That's how the move from $4k to $5k formed last month. They don't always play out, but they do more often than not.
It's the opposite to the huge descending triangle that formed pretty much all of last year, then finally broke downwards violently last November.
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:58:43
The greatest thing to ever happen to BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:39:13
Schnoor, Taproot and Coinjoin will provide BTC that privacy feature.
My concern is, how the US government will react to it. Once chain analysis becomes almost impossible, do they come in with the hammer?
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:18:10
That the mempool is down 90% since Dec 2017, yet transactions are at an ATH, suggests that Segwit is working just fine, even at 40% adoption.

Yes, ,it is. So how about having some damn patience and allowing growth to occur steadily, instead of wanting everything yesterday?

Sooner rather than later doesn't matter.
What is most important, is that it's done *right*.
Look at TCP/IP and GPS. They took 20-25 years to become economically viable for businesses and consumers. We're in year 11 of crypto.
Put the foundation in correctly now, and let the rest take care of itself.

Nice post. So many thick cunts out there think the world starts and ends with the US and Europe.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:58:40
Everyone should have a small amount that they transact with. Cold storage can be just that.
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:08:28
To the contrary, the longer Lightning remains viable and continues to grow, the more convinced I am that BTC \*will\* be the one chain that can do everything.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:14:50
:-D Is that the best you’ve got you whiny little bitch?
I don’t live in the UK by the way. Looks like you’re a thick cunt as well.

Roger also uses the Bitcoin twitter handle to promote bcash.
Is he really trustworthy?
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:03:33
And? So was the BTC volume in 2009.
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:45:30
What about now?
@_date: 2018-12-07 08:20:19
I’m still concerned with the on chain fees to close a channel if the price flies up again. People aren’t going to pay $50-100 to close a channel.
That problem needs to be solved for mass adoption.

You fucking thick cunt.
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:06:58

Go and read the article linked to the genesis block.
Then you’ll understand what Satoshi was trying to do. Bitcoin’s not just money. It’s a hedge against corporatism, the capitalist system, and the governments and institutions who facilitate it.

Old people are definitely buying Bitcoin.
Young people are definitely buying Bitcoin.
Just because *you* don’t see it, doesn’t mean it does not happen.
To counter this, I saw on a Facebook group amongst an expat community of hundreds, somebody post about “where/how to buy Bitcoin” in the region we are in. Surprisingly, the comments stretched into the hundreds, with dozens of people posting different suggestions.
Does this mean mass adoption soon? No. But to suggest nobody is buying is just as ludicrous.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:49:37

It shows an upwards curve. The actual opposite of decline.
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:54:46
Should have replied on the “what it’s backed by” with “computer science and math”. No need to rely nor depend upon a third party. Therefore it’s trustless.
