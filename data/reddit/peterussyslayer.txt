The price you bought it at is locked in even if the coins haven't been deposited into your wallet.

Stop being so dramatic.

Sorry but the telegraph analogy he makes is total bullshit.

Don't get me wrong, I'm totally stoked about how the value of bitcoin is skyrocketing. I Just feel like the real innovation and value of bitcoin (the blockchain, the decentralized digital currency) is not really recognized anymore. Everybody sees it as a way too make a quick buck and not how this technology will completely change the world.

 God I fucking love you.

Seriously asking, why would it be bad to increase the block size? Maybe im just ignorant but I don't see why it would be bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:21:06
This is absolutely outrageous. I can't believe this is even acceptable, something needs to change this is not sustainable.

I keep my coins in a wallet, not on an exchange. That is costing a ridiculous amount of money right now. Do some research.

Really wish they had a mobile app. Big reason why I like coinbase.

You're a dumbass.

This is some of the most simple minded shit I have ever read.

So in order to move or spend my bitcoin I can only use GDAX. Got it. 
So decentralized!

@_date: 2017-10-11 16:08:56
What would you recommend? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:04:25
Where the fuck do you people shop? I cam buy a full weeks worth of groceries for $30-$40.

Didn't Dave Ramsey day this about saving? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:57:37
It's not going to happen.
