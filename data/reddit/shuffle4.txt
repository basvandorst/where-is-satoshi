To the people saying it’s just a trend and doesn’t prove anything. While your right you might be missing the idea that most of the bitcoin sold on exchanges is freshly mined coin and directly contributes to the majority of available non hodl supply. If demand stays steady and supply drops then price increases. This leads to a decrease in the amount of asks posted on an exchange. People are willing to pay more for it when there’s less of it. How much it can move is up to debate but that is why this is more than just a trend.

Care to elaborate? I’m sure what you mean? I know miners save a lot of mined coins but they show up on exchanges just the same. Have to pay for the electricity somehow. This also constributes even more to drop in supply if they’re just held after mining.

This is a good point and while i understand your reasoning I'm sure the difficulty would drop a decent bit after the split. Most of the current mining hardware would become unprofitable over night unless the operation has incredibly cheap/"free" electricity. This could change if new more efficient hardware is released. This will leave people who would have to sell the majority of their mined coin from the market behind so it should balance back to 6.25 btc total with 6.25&gt; btc sold for electricity costs for the remaining miners. I'm a miner at the moment and plan to turn off my machines after the split unless difficulty drops dramatically. that is unlikely be we will have to see.

Yeah I always thought that and iv seen more of a connection but I don't think that was ever proven was it.?

This bitcoin wallet is assumed to be satoshi's by some perhaps if it is then that year at least was in his mind when it was created if it so happened to be a vanity wallet and not just random coincidence. This wallet untill recently had only deposits

its got a lot more of a effect than might be immediately obvious. and your right 10k is stupid low maybe 10k on one exchange. don't forget bitcoin is the first of its kind. never have we been able to obverse something with such a strictly guaranteed count of maximum supply without looking at how much has been lost to the void of the SHA256 algorithms security. demand has a much greater effect for now yes but lack of supply will only amplify it. however supply has far more to do with bitcoins price than any other commodity because of its deflationary aspects.  that's why we usually see such a rise after the halving. this could be an incredibly inaccurate statement but most people who invest don't give a damn or care about the halving much less mining.

[ this exists, and has existed long before bitcoin was around. It has been observed in bitcoin after the previous two halvings in reference to supply and demand on EXCHANGES specifically.
if supply decreases and demand stays constant or rises = price rises.
if demand rises and supply stays constant or decreases  = price rises.
if supply increases &lt;only possible if large amounts of people decide to sell which is very possible&gt; and demand stays constant or decreases  = price falls.
if demand decreases and supply stays constant or increases = price falls.
The vast majority of new bitcoin supply sold on exchanges is mining profits sold to pay for electricity costs. bitcoin has a unique situation. because it has a limited supply and people abide by our holy words of HODL this leaves us with a odd control over regular traded supply not observed In any other currency aside from precious metals and resources. anything can happen of course but we know it will have a noticeable effect on regularly traded supply.
edit: some extra words and corrections. hopefully this will answer OP's question  [u/ballsackyjo]( 
@_date: 2018-10-17 19:49:17
it usually does rise a bit before the halving. usually this is not by enough for the market to level out from the repercussions of the drop in supply and the possible increase in demand but this has only been observed twice 
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:44:56
your right that is a lot but for the most part that's the same fraction of the total traded in a day. say 10,000-20,000 bought and sold multiple times in a day for example totaling to some far larger amount of trade volume. if that wasn't the case then far more bitcoin than what will ever exist will be traded in a matter of a month based on that daily trade volume estimate. this just further shows that trade volume doesnt accurately describe trade supply but only a combination of both traded supply and the demand on that day. because there is multiple exchanges one exchange in china only accepting yuan may experience a far larger drop in supply causing the price to rise on that exchange. across all the various exchanges the equilibrium for price matters less on total daily trade volume and more of average trade volume on each exchange. your idea of human influence is right but that just refers to demand. the decrease in supply will only help at that point.

Give hq bots a search. People run them for free money. Next time you play ya check out some of the really nonsense easy questions. Roughly the same amount of people choose the incorrect answers 
Edit: not exactly proof but it does happen far more often than you would think

Nope not yet apparently. I tried to make the same post and got sent here.. are we just going to ignore this? I have been a user on this subreddit for years but i don’t know if i can trust either side anymore

This post made me realize how lucky i am. I just graduated from college this year and since late 2010 iv been mining. mining was less of a hobby before the rise of the ASICs but regardless Im glad iv kept what I had. now that im out of college im digging into my bitcoin stockpile to support myself for now. feels like im selling a portion of my soul every time. no student loans or no bitcoin is the answer im looking for now

I ordered s9's from bitmain. I got my miners. I even had to return one. got that one back too when it shipped. I don't doubt that they could have problems I just find it hard to believe they attempted to purposefully scam this guy.

what? why are you so angry? what does political opinion have to do with this? I'm not sure you or anyone else here understands what your saying or why. dude are you ok?
Edit: dude your reddit history is that of the most hateful and unintelligent I have ever seen. Do you even know what a libertarian is?

I'm amazed. I adopted him as my satoshi just because he represented what I wanted the father of bitcoin to look and act like. I never really thought that it could be him. If it was id rather not know for sure, for his own safety. although after his AMA on r/Bitcoin and now seeing this I don't think I understand the drive for him to become so involved with something that he claimed to know nothing about before the extraordinary negative experience he received when the press got a hold of their hunch. If he is then I am happy. if not then I'm glad he joined the community.

He's not the satoshi we need but the satoshi we have always wanted. All praise Bitcoin Dad

you should read up on how fireproof most consumer safes actually are.. some are just thin steel plates encasing drywall. house fires will heat a safe to well above the ignition temperature of paper. knowledge is power

What I could no longer find proof of is the two blocks that my graphics card solved before the first split. man that 100 BTC would have been nice especially now. Mined with a HD 6970M &gt; HD 7970 &gt; 800 G/Hash asic. The asic only mined about 2 btc total. The first withdraw of ~1 BTC was mined with my old gaming laptop's HD 6970m

ya think so? the power consumption could get a little high. any luck with that by chance?

not sure if this is useful or not but this is the wallet that my bitcoins ended up in after a chip group buy. contains many of the Avalon orders probably not all of them though if someone wanted to get a rough estimate of how many are shipping out to fabricators
