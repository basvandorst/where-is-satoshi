I get you might be down a lot of money but that’s no reason to get emotional.  Investing is about numbers not emotion and the fact of the matter is the risk vs reward traditional tech stocks vs crypto is much lower.  Sure crypto did a 10x over two years but the risk is much much higher than traditional business with real assets and services.  But the main point is the speculative phase is over.  Bitcoin isn’t doing a 100x like it did in the past.  All these “investors” that are hoping to become ultra wealthy are lying to themselves if they think that.  And since all they really care about is making money there are better option for them than crypto. Also I love investing in Bitcoin and have been holding since 2010 with coins I mined.
@_date: 2018-09-30 16:49:11
You going to get downvoted to hell but your right.  The speculative stage of bitcoin is done.  There is no more 100x happening even 10x will take years and years to achieve. Everyone who got in to get rick quick will get burned once and sell.  Bitcoins value will rise with increase in utility and innovation which takes years to build.  In the meantime there are much better investments if you just want to make money.  Hell FAANG stocks would have been a much better investment than bitcoin the last few years if all you cared about was making money.

Yea that’s fine but that doesn’t make it some big scary scam.  He chose to recognize bitcoin cash and bitcoin.  That his fucking choice.  **AND THE USERS RESPONSIBILTY TO VERIFY WHAT THEY ARE BUYING ** .  It’s even listed as bitcoin cash.  Everyone on this sub talks about finding consensus then freaks out and attacks anything that isn’t following their rules.
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:53:28
Cool story bro, he was talking about Ram requirements not storage.  Plus why the fuck would you not want to see the code base optimized? Almost like you would like to see Bitcoin not improve past it current state for your own agenda.
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:41:40
There are a lot more ways to make the core client more efficient.  Check out the gigabit block talk that was done a few months ago for what’s already been achieved.  Gigabit blocks are already working on consumer level hardware.
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:22:45
He legit just said a bull run will begin when price increases lol
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:50:40
It’s not... obviously fly by wire startups are going to implement alpha software with no support before major players.
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:56:34
He’s wrong but you cannot just look at the wealth inequality in the worlds richest nations.  The poorest of the poor in the US are still top 1% in the world.
@_date: 2018-09-14 03:14:05
Lmao there are 12 articles a day talking about is and that “attacking” bitcoin core.  The attitude In 2010 was good let it be attacked because if it can be I don’t want it.  Now it’s I put my lunch money in trying to get a lambo so if you do anything other than what Bitcoin Core devs say fuck you we are going to regulate against you. But when someone has to resort to picking out spelling mistakes they don’t have any reasonable arguments left.
@_date: 2018-09-14 00:40:42
But when Segwit2X had a majority of hash power signaling for it this community claimed it wasn’t “the real Bitcoin”...
@_date: 2018-09-30 18:13:03
There is more than just x is up x%!!! The risk of crypto is extremely high.  There is penny stock that are up 1000x in the same period that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea if you just want to make money.
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:43:38
What if the bitcoin core devs forked bitcoin core to 8mb blocks would it still be “the real” bitcoin ?  What if every single exchange started trading Bitcoin Gold as Bitcoin under btc, would it be the real Bitcoin.  I honestly cannot believe the type of shit I read here.  Obviously you have you bias but at least pretend to be reasonable...
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:05:56
Yes I do... Nice move the goal post to wealth so you can say the couple in America with a 400k mortgage are poorer than the street sweeper in Africa.
@_date: 2018-09-02 18:51:20
Is there somewhere to see the average time it takes to find a route? Hasn’t it increased to a few seconds now? 
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:26:17
Lol wut
@_date: 2018-09-01 18:45:43
Even worse is that it’s been a year since Segwit and usage is only at 40% and lightning has zero real world usage.  However this sub is hyping up a private company that is using proprietary technology from Blockstream to move transactions off chain...  yikes.
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:00:20
Just amount of girl I get will double every 6 months.  0 x 2 is still 0.
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:20:18
Lightning network has been 6 months away since 2015.  Ver certainly didn’t promise that gem.
@_date: 2018-08-22 09:00:09
You don’t seem to have read the whitepaper.  It’s mining nodes not full nodes. But the question of what is Bitcoin is much to broad for this discussion.
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:37:40
So by that logic bitcoin test network tokens are bitcoins and what you currently refer to bitcoin as is a imposter that should be boycotted. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 10:00:25
Be sure to leave lots of time for routing too!
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:36:16
Meh, no sympathy for you from me.  You took extreme risk for the chance extreme returns and lost.  Look at the next year do you think Schnor signatures, MAST, lightning network ect will increase Bitcoins value above where it is today then hold.  Otherwise relies your investment is a sunk cost and cut you loses and move on.
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:15:41
I hope we have a crypto winter again.  The best developments happen during crypto winters.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:50:57
Go ahead and try to get a block size increase committed to Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:57:24
The non mining nodes will reject the blocks that break *their* rules.  Blocks mined by the mining nodes will be propagated just fine be mining nodes.  As the tens of thousands of non mining nodes do not produce blocks they are left at the mercy of the few mining nodes they have left.  Difficulty doesn’t adjust right away so if enough hash power leaves it could take months for them to reach a difficulty adjustment.  In the mean time transaction fees will soar as they are fighting to get their transaction included into less blocks.  At the same time profitability will decreases so miners are running at a loss until difficulty adjustment. 
**b b but muh full node is verifying every transaction!!!! XD** 
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:47:04
Take the cost of power including inflation for running for 40+ years, also include the cost of hardware upgrades to keep you chances constant.  The take the total cost and compare it if you would have invested in equities market.  You would probably gave hundreds of thousands if not millions.
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:48:57
They were right.  It’s a year later and adoption is still under 50% just like they warned.  Fees spiked to average of $20 during peek bubble turning a lot of people off of bitcoin.  Had the block size been raised back then there would have been **immediate** fee reduction increasing adoption while all eyes where on Bitcoin.  The block size could now have then been reduced in the following year as Segwit reached 70-80% adoption and schnor signatories where implemented.  Instead we where crippled by the my way or the highway gang.
@_date: 2018-08-21 08:28:08
I agree with you that’s why I’m bearish for the next 3 years.
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:33:15
There sales aren’t affected because no one pays with bitcoin in the first place.  They aren’t putting in work for 1% of 1% who pay with btc and complain.
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:15:54
We didn’t have this exact same scenario at all quit making shit up.  We had bitcoin formed into a alt coin.  There was new branding, replay protection and replay protection.  In a scenario where all actors are acting in their own interest the miners wouldn’t have replay protection and transactions broadcast by the “thousand of non mining nodes” would be broad cast on the new longer proof of work chain. Not two separate chains. It would be up to the non mining nodes to hard fork replay protection as it would be in their best interests to do so. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:25:00
Why?  It’s still going to take years to get service providers on board just like big blockers warned.  We could have raised the the block size while people where still using bitcoin during the last bubble and reduced it when lightning was actually usable but instead core handicapped it and shot fees to $50 a tx.  And surprise surprise a year later segwit is still at 40% and lightning adoption is 0.  All while small blockers are cheering Bakkt using proprietary blockstream liquid TM sidechains as our saviour.
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:30:19
Fees happened and broken promises happened.
@_date: 2018-08-20 01:09:04
Who the fuck is going to use lightning if they have to install Linux and become a systems admin to secure there funds ��
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:39:38
Fees got to high and people started pretending bitcoin wasn’t a currency instead of easing the block size until lighting was adopted.
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:55:53


 Wut?  It’s not at 70-80% it’s at 45%.  Low fees don’t stop development.  Fees dropped after the bubble popped and development is still ongoing.
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:22:31
So you argument for not raising the block size is other scaling solutions are just ideas and won’t be implemented for years. Hmmmmmmm
@_date: 2018-08-12 08:02:47
Because Bitcoin doesn’t have a owner.  Anyone is free to fork and claim they are Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:02:17
Can you cite where it says this in the white paper.  Plus the white paper is describing a protocol not trademark law.
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:43:49
You do know that bitcoin cash had the most accumulated difficulty at one point.  So according to the white paper this sub should have accepted it as bitcoin. Or when 2x fork had 90% of hash power behind it the narrative for newbies was changed to “only the number of non mining nodes matter because they validate the rules”. The white paper does not dictate trademark law of a open source project. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:02:45
Mines in 2010.  The nose dive was obvious to anyone who has been staring at the charts since 2010.  Funny watching all these get rich quick types who could give a fuck less about the tech get destroyed.
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:59:05
says liquid is the devil and is claiming it’s the second coming of Christ.  Can someone not biased explain the pros and cons of it.
@_date: 2018-10-07 03:27:46
Lol bu-bu-but my full node verifies blocks!!!!
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:45:19
Hashrate has to be high enough that bad actors can’t attack the network.
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:36:28
Personally I’ve only seen people supportive of it here.  That and Bakkt which I think is using liquid? Thanks for your perspective.
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:53:15
I think their conspiracy is more that the main chain is strategically being limited to force users to use sidechains like liquid.  The thought is that if lighting and the main chain work perfectly what is the value add of liquid?
@_date: 2018-10-14 17:09:45
Is the 20 something company thing true? Or can anyone run a node?
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:28:32
I mined in 2010 and am still holding.   Can confirm I don’t really post here much anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:22:20
And thouse places can’t afford the fees to use the damn thing.
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:38:10
People have been saying this since 2015.  At what point do we say this isn’t fucking happening and let’s move on with other scaling solutions in the mean time?
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:17:56
Because no one knew 20k would be the top... Also I don’t trade at all I just hold.
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:39:00
Darknets don’t use bitcoin anymore.  It’s to expensive because of the block limit and offers no privacy. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 21:33:42
The base layer is to slow and doesn’t have the capacity to handle the worlds payments.  Lightning network is coming along but isn’t there yet.  If you thing BTC could replace Visa *today* your delusional. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:53:15
There is no complaint it’s just facts.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:50:58
Exactly I could tap my visa or:
Deposit fiat on a sketchy exchange.
Pay a large TX to move funds to my personal wallet
Pay a TX fee to fund a LN channel 
Pay a watchtower service to ensure me funds are secure
Buy what I want
Then go through everything again to replace those bitcoins again 
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:59:17
Why?  Only thing that makes money is money.  You want your kids to be safe salves for the rest of there lives?  Or is this something the poor tell each other to somehow make themselves believe inheriting money is “bad”.
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:28:43
Trust me buddy I have more BTC than you ever will.  I mined on my 5770 before you where born.  Idiots like you give bitcoin a bad name.  A better Bitcoin mean actually improving bitcoin because current day Bitcoin is no where good enough to be a global payment system.
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:18:58
Bitcoin fees hit a three year low as no one uses it.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:16:51
That why I put all my life saving on the lotto max!
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:01:04
No. But a better Bitcoin sure will.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:53:51
This is your logic and number are FUD designed to destabilize bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:50:57
I know that a majority of miners aren’t paying residential rates.  But instead of correcting his calculations this sub immediately jump to call anything that won’t let them sell for a high price later on FUD.
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:10:55
Definitely not true on a global level.  True for many nations BC Canada is 10cents then 16 after a certain usage level.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:57:32
Quit spreading fud Bitcoin is owned by ~10% of the population already. Just imagine when it hits 90% we will be able to sell our coins for millions!
@_date: 2018-07-19 01:38:00
Haha no Bitcoin is going to 1 million XD then we can all sell and retire ��
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:01:48
Miners are running full nodes as well.
@_date: 2018-07-20 00:59:35
Probably should.  That’s like finding 6x America’s wealth at once if I recall correctly.  It would absolutely wreck the markets.

This attack vector has nothing to do with the client being a “think client.  Lest I remind you the core client has had even more serious bug than this.  No matter what client you use you open yourself to these same risks.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:57:21
Ain’t no one setting up a full time node.  We need visa and MasterCard lighting watchtower nodes and block stream liquid side chains to scale.
