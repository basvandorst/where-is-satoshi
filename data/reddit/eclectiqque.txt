MY FIRST SUCCESSFUL SUMMONING 
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:15:12
still waiting for him too. he was through my first thoughts when I saw $1000 on coindesk 
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:15:58
paging @_date: 2017-02-20 08:33:40
That's a good attitude
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:42:30
I'm afraid the price seems a little bit too high compared to my local bitcoin seller :(
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:40:28


care to support your opinion?
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:07:59
i'm unfortunately on a chromebook and will have to install it on a windows machine. exchange? I saw some charts with prices lower than what coindesk shows. am I buying from other bitsquare users?
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:46:58
Coindesk says $890, my local service sells for $908 and cex.io sells for $970. Thing is, cex.io does it instantly and my local service does it the next day at 2 PM (whichever the rate would be tomorrow). Isn't it too expensive to buy it from cex.io? What do you think?

true words, but I've been a hodler and I'm planning to hodl for at least 5 years. It's just that I don't want to depend on tomorrow's exchange rate
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:20:57
Thank you for the answer but I don't feel like you answered my question

How come two people know his balance?
@_date: 2017-01-16 11:10:31
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-01-11 23:24:21
but it's mainly a joke, right?
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:13:21
you cheeky...
@_date: 2017-01-11 23:20:09
wait is dogecoin for real?
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:57:24
Thank you. I don't want to make arbitrage. Just want to buy bitcoin and hodl, but I didn't know if $80 dollars more per bitcoin is ok or not. I will look more into your link
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:02:25
so correct me if I'm wrong please.
that's why with every transaction you get a new address, right? and ideally you use the new one every time in order not to give someone access to this kind of information, right?
@_date: 2016-11-28 01:27:57
Can you elaborate a little bit more?
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:35:41
Heh, too late for that :D but i got your point
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:42:30
thank you!
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:29:10
The real MVP
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:36:05
got it. I feel like my economics gaps are hurting me right now :(
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:46:20
...Yes...yes... initiate him
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:55:01
why/when would btc need a bailout?
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:54:00
damn, I'm sorry I'm not too much of an expert with the words. by upgrade I meant another cryptocurrency that's inherently better than bitcoin
also, how can it have a systematic failure, given the fact that it's decentralized?
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:58:13


Thank you! Will remember that!
So all in all the government CAN have something to say against bitcoin. I saw a meme-post last days with batman slapping robin. R says the government can work against bitcoin and B slaps him saying it's decentralized.


Can you a little bit more on that please?
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:58:56
100% agreed but looking into the future, I can't see why it can't be implemented for the masses
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:48:00
RemindMe! 6 months
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:10:05
That s exactly the type of comment he's complaining about *sigh*
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:27:09
thank you so much for answering. I have yet to read about fungibility and many other terms. any idea why it has grown like this in the last hours?
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:56:23
that's what I'm thinking! but I came here so I can gain some balance on this thought as I'm way too biased towards buying bitcoin.


we can easily imagine a moment when bitcoin is found to be "leaking" security and there comes another cryptocurrency with this problem fixed and some other major upgrades
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:02:10
even after a drop. lmao
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:08:54
Congratulations for being part of a team that cares about its custmers/users. The quick response is appreciated and I'll stick with Jaxx thanks to your comment. I guess you have a bot that notifies you when someone mentions the name, right?
@_date: 2016-10-25 14:02:09
appreciate the answer, but it doesn't answer my question
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:13:02
I'd have liked to know your take on the veiled-founder part. Thank you anyways for the answer. What do you think?
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:05:14
Didn't know that. Any reason they would do this? Can you name some other examples?
@_date: 2016-10-26 10:22:40
Thank you. This is the general consensus that I've noticed and it makes sense. Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2016-10-25 14:04:15
1) Then how do so many of us put their money, one of their most valuable asset, into something that's just 99% transparent (that 1% being this founder mask)
2) Just started using jaxx.io as they offer their service on iOS, Android, Chrome extension and Windows (I use devices from all these four platforms). You think this is ok?
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:12:46
it's an internet joke
@_date: 2016-10-28 16:46:45
Thanks a lot for the thorough answers!
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:14:25
Thank you, Anthony. Is this a bot or do you have a bot noticing you when there's Jaxx activity on reddit?
@_date: 2016-10-25 21:05:49
Just stepped into the bitcoin world but chose you guys as you offer access from windows, chrome (I have a chromebook), iOS and Android (I have both phones). So I need to access my wallet from any device. Props!
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:19:43
