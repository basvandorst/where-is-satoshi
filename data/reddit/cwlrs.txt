It can be nice to treat yourself every now and then. If BTC appreciates, like it has, I would just treat it like an upswing and buy something nice. If it goes down, treat it like a downswing.

How do I vote on what is correct, if I run a node? I feel like I just let it run and I don't do anything.

It does sometimes end, if you run it every day.
The most recent few blocks take longer because less nodes have them to distribute.
Once it's up to date all funds will appear. But yeah, it can take days. When it's up to date it's much faster to stay up to date in the future.

It's the mindset of the users of the exchange. Most people are hodling, thinking the value will appreciate, so bitfinex is relying on the users to not withdraw fiat $. Even people who sell on the exchange might do so for altcoins or $ on the exchange, who leave it there. It may not necessarily be a withdrawal to the bank.
Then there's tether dollars coming into circulation, origin uncertain, buying more BTC, which inflates the price some more.
If there is a big confidence scare in bitfinex, and a lot of people bail out, bitfinex may not have enough fiat $ to pay off everyone, which will drastically devalue BTC on their exchange, and BTC in general.
I would say being insolvent doesn't cause a price spike, it's other reasons that cause the spike, then being insolvent can cause a crash if a negative truth is revealed.

Seems fine to me. Hack is more important than small increase on ATH.

We've already seen BTC dominance go from 33% to 45%. That's already a massive move.

Do you mind explaining what each of the lines mean?

Oh, legit 100% coincidence. Nice spot.

Thanks a lot. Does the increasing gradient of the lines imply the growth is accelerating or does it just happen to be there or what?

Is there somewhere to check number of connections to network? I'm on 10mb/s download spd

Thought I sent my dad an email with screenshots for this exact reason. Only sent a link to a live updating website :(.
In the content of the message I noted there was 54 nodes a few days ago, and now 154. That was jan 23rd
