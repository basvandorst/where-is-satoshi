I personally value bitcoin users. They pay transaction fees like everyone else and are fully entitled to use a decentralised service like bitcoin if they please.
This negativity towards increasing the userbase amongst you and some of your colleagues is really quite puzzling. Bitcoin isn't some elitist tool for you. It is an open system for anyone in the world.
@_date: 2015-12-26 15:27:27
Of course they aren't completely unaffected. They give value to the system and it is they who will decide the future exchange value of bitcoin - not you. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 23:52:47


This simply isn't true.  A merchant/payment processor can tell within just a few seconds with a high degree of probability whether a transaction is an attempted double spend. Thus, 0-conf whilst not perfect or absolutely reliable is more than sufficient for the vast majority of low cost transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:46:21
Let's be clear - the only reason that the community is riven with this dispute is not because they Core developers are introducing optimisations such as segwit or working on 3rd party payment layers like lightning. They are fantastic and if bitcoin continues to grow economically in terms of transaction volumes eventually lightning will be necessary.
No, the reason there is such a bitter rift is because some of the developers at Core are trying to change the basic economic model behind bitcoin because &lt;insert variable reason here&gt;. 
For the last 7 years anyone who controlled private keys to bitcoin outputs was able to transact with bitcoin without issue. The system responded to periods of high demand by increasing the number of transactions written into blocks within the blockchain dynamically. Until now, a single constant in the code (max_blocksize) has been reached at 1mb. Now suddenly according to developers like Maxwell bitcoin will fail if the blocksize rises beyond this entirely arbitrary figure which was selected many years ago. Now we hear that bitcoin is not to be allowed to grow with market demand as before, instead artificial caps are being placed upon the number of people who may transact on the network. Worse instead of a flat fee in this new reality no bitcoin user or company in the space asked for the cost of a transaction will be decided by how busy the network is.
The community has no problem with developers who work on Core being rewarded for their bitcoin wizardry at for profit enterprises - unless of course they hope to sell cheaper transaction platforms by making bitcoin artificially and unnecessarily expensive.
Eventually this situation would have arisen where a group tried to coopt the project. The market will provide a solution - either bitcoin dies by investment moving elsewhere or competing implementations which do not artificially limit the growth of the currency arise in the place of Core. Miners will help decide this. Christmas is here and the turkeys are voting.

I have been looking for an excellent post on reddit from a few weeks ago that basically disproves this statement but i can't fish it out. 
It all comes down to the definition of significant I suppose. Given most bitcoin transactions are for very low amounts 0-conf is safe if merchants accept the risk IMO.
Merchants are not asking for this change! In fact the opposite. Why not introduce FSS instead of opt-in full RBF if the aim is to prevent double spends?

I think when you say "large block proponents" you mean everyone apart from a few Core developers and people working for companies developing off chain solutions.
The uncomfortable truth is that the limit could be safely raised (a change to a single line of code) removing any need for a centrally planned fee market (artificially increasing transaction fees). Are you denying 2 or even 4mb (in ten minutes) is unsafe?
Do you deny that you want rising fees to make off chain solutions such as lightning cheaper than main chain transactions?

Core is great in the main. But it has major failings within the development team which were it not for the peculiarities and interconnected nature of the ecosystem would have led to the project being forked by the community and industry long ago. 
If Core start to hurt the bottom line of miners then they will see how important they are very quickly. You can see the pushback from industry seeing its future potential earnings growth threatened, and from users seeing the original Satoshi scaling design of bitcoin being attacked with things like the fee market and blocksize limits intruding on network demand (not to mention stupidity like RBF).
Ultimately what is bad for bitcoin growth is bad for mining income. As the block reward falls the implementation which offers the most income for miners in transaction fees will be supported by mining companies. 
Here things get interesting and small block enthusiasts lose the argument in my view. It is essentially exponentially many more little transactions with growing blocksizes versus linear growing transaction counts with rising fees and economically constrained blocksizes  on chain (additional payment layers taking fees for parcels of little transactions - which go to trusted third parties, not miners). The second approach is far more complicated and is not proven to work - in fact it fundamentally changed the economic levers keeping bitcoin balanced. 
Furthermore, the small block theorem relies upon bitcoin retaining (in fact growing massively in) value through a transformation period from being a cheap, open to all, scaling ecash to an expensive (more than alternative chains) settlement layer unsuitable for day to day transactions for average Joe.
Where the buyers for this expensive settlement layer coin inflation come from or why they don't just use something else which has utility is not explained. Nor is what happens to the businesses which give bitcoin utility as an internet currency.
The alternative is a plethora of clients each creating a protocol consensus (not developer consensus). Changes to the protocol should be discussed openly and the free market should decide via competing implementations what bitcoin is - not miners or a few self nominated bitcoin 'experts' who feel Satoshi got it wrong..
We can see this happening now with the emergence of competing implementations. Either Core cleans house and aligns with the economic majority or it hurts bitcoin and is replaced by the market.

0-conf is extremely reliable if the merchant waits just a few seconds of the transaction to propagate across the network.

@_date: 2015-12-25 22:27:22


Freudian slip there I suppose. If you truly believe this and understand that blocks are filling up as we reach the max_blocksize constant for the first time in 7 years then you would be advocating increasing the blocksize to a safe ceiling which will not adversely effect either running costs for nodes or create difficulties for miners. Say 2/3/4 mb.
Instead your position is to allow the transaction limits of the system to be deliberately and totally unnecessarily breached, leading to a preventable disruption in the equilibrium of the bitcoin ecosystem.
The various reasons for this dramatic change seem to be that there is a dramatic need to introduce a fee market right now. Why?
Why not let bitcoin continue to grow with transaction volume being driven by user demand? Miners are well compensated and will be until many years in the future. Why throttle the system now?
And let's be clear I think lightning is a great idea, but not at the expense of extinguishing the economics maintaining the security of the main chain.

The reason there is mounting division in the space is nothing to do with anything you said. It is simply because the economics which have driven bitcoin for the last seven years are about to be broken by Core.

@_date: 2015-06-01 14:47:35
And herein lies the rub. 
There seem to be a reasonable number of vocal people advocating higher transaction fees as some kind of free market solution to the upcoming blocksize catastrophe in 2016.
They don't seem to consider that:
a) people want to pay extremely low transaction fees - that is one point of using bitcoin over fiat services
b) letting blocks fill and causing massive delays in transaction processing is a failure of the network and a massive PR disaster waiting to happen ('why bother using bitcoin when it costs more than a credit card and takes 8 hours to confirm a transaction')
c) bitcoin was originally designed without such blocksize limitations by Satoshi..
d) 80% of the community is already in favour of increasing the blocksize
e) An artifical 7tps limit and bitcoin rising as a global payment network of any relevence are totally incompatible..
Some people may instead view bitcoin as a store of value - a digital gold if you will. They will be disappointed that a lot of the expected value built into the currency evaporates when bitcoin stops growing  along the expected trajectory due to artificial network limitations..
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:29:42

Can you run bitcoind on a dialup in subsaharan africa? Probably not. 
But the reality is that the vast majority of bitcoin users do not run nodes, will never run nodes, and should not need to run nodes for the network to be successful. In fact if bitcoin increases its user base 10 or 100 fold the number of nodes is unlikely to grow as the vast majority of users will be interacting with bitcoin using smartphone and web wallet services.

Your score is unpredictable because your opinions are unpopular.
A lower blocksize leads to congestion, rising fees and a change in the balance of economic incentives which have driven bitcoin for the last seven years. 
There is no evidence whatsoever that keeping the blocksize fixed is beneficial for bitcoin. Bitcoin has hard forked before however with no major problems apart from a few blocks of lost mining fees.

Just because the maximum blocksize is raised to a level which is considerably above the current level doesn't mean blocksizes will approach that point for years to come.

Transaction costs are only part of the story of course, but an important component to consider. What attracted me to bitcoin was the monetary properties of the currency and its potential to become 'money as a protocol' for the internet.
Clearly it cannot scale to infinity but it can sure go a lot further than now with a lot more users on board before additional payment layers are required. 
Stopping now risks the entire project. The fact that you cannot see when even someone like Jeff is openly warning his colleagues is quite surprising (see Dunning-Kruger).

In the last couple of days has released data suggesting most (Chinese) miners support an increase in the blocksize to 2-4mb. There has been controversy because one of the largest companies in the space is openly experimenting with a different bitcoin software implementation that increases the maximum blocksize exponentially. 
There are concerns from Core developers over increasing the maximum blocksize because of centralisation of nodes and their latest roadmap contains no plans to do so. 
The economic majority comprising industry, exchanges, payment processors etc have already given support to a rise in the maximum blocksize parameter. 
Why? Bitcoin for the last seven years has grown organically with rising transactional demand being absorbed by the network and written into the blockchain. As bitcoin has become more popular, block sizes have grown and we now are close to hitting the previously irrelevant maximum blocksize constant which is set at 1mb. When this is reached regularly a backlog of transactions, rising fees and the inability to fit x transactions into y blockspace will commence. 
This is a change in the fundamental balance of economic incentives that have driven bitcoin for the last seven years. People who continue to run Core as the 1mb maximum blocksize limit is reached are agreeing to a fundamental change in the economics that have thus far driven bitcoin. 
Despite this there is no sign of the Core implementation changing it's position. Instead they are focussing on clever optimisations which require large and complex codebase changes (yet again) across the ecosystem.  We are told - this is open source if you don't like it, fork it. 
So we have.
Bitcoin Unlimited allows the individual node operator to set the maximum blocksize to a level they are happy with. We believe that bitcoin protocol details such as the maximum blocksize should be decided by the market through emergent network consensus. We believe relying upon central planners to decide economic variables is wrong when the market can decide perfectly instead. It is my view that this civil war which has riven the community is about power over control of the codebase to decide what constitutes the bitcoin protocol. We feel that leaves bitcoin at risk of subversion through centralised weakness and the inevitable outcome of this conflict is market led solutions being chosen by the community. If you care about bitcoin continuing along the path of success give it a moment of thought. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:22:52
This is all about them clinging onto power to control the bitcoin protocol.
Sadly for them the eventual and inevitable outcome of this drama is the emergence of multiple competing clients which remove protocol settings such as the maximum blocksize out of the hands of developers and instead move them to a market based network consensus.

My point was pretending that what goes in and out of the bitcoin codebase is based on peer review is hilarious.
@_date: 2015-12-13 13:13:34
It will remain peer-to-peer as Satoshi originally wanted. Satoshi refined his comments about the future of the network and mining as you well know but for some reason choose not to quote!
No honest person in the debate believes that keeping the limit below of the demands of the network causes centralisation which is damaging for the health of the network. On the contrary almost everyone understands that a network with a constant backlog of transactions not written into blocks damages bitcoin immensely.
Funny how everyone can see this plainly except those companies who employ 'Core' developers and wish to profit from off chain payment solutions, eh?
SW is not a scalability solution. The countdown has begun before industry again decide to sidestep Core for an alternative implementation which puts users ahead of profit.

Lots of words and I am sure you think you are right.
Why didn't Satoshi write about bitcoin becoming a settlement layer? Why did he explicitly state what is in the paper and far later discuss VISA level aspirations for bitcoin?

No I think in a world of cryptocurrency as a developing asset class if you think bitcoin will continue to find use with high transaction fees when cheaper suitable alternatives exist you are going to get schooled by the market.
If bitcoin gas no utility as a currency then it loses all appeal as a store of value, which is based upon the premise of new users buying it for its amazing monetary properties and store of value which is based upon the premise of new users ..

Blockchain.info is not perfect, I think they should offer mandatory 2-factor, not email the wallet file routinely like they do, and offer multi-sig services as an option for larger balance addresses.
But if you are using a web wallet holding 60 btc then you take the risk of being compromised.

Jesus stolfi you are turning into quite the troll. Posting here, on r/buttcoin and bitcointalk!


For a south american academic it is surprising that you mention inflation as a problem for bitcoin given it will drop to ~5% in 2016 and ~2.5% around 2020, 1.25% in 2024,  0.75% in 2028 etc. Seems to me that in less than ten years bitcoin will have inflation near 1% - and from there will drop exponentially over the coming years. How else do you expect coins to be distributed?


Name one commodity or currency you can predict purchasing power with please? Name one other currency you can predict the monetary inflation of please?


Hmm this is particularly weak thinking. The price in 2013 started off in the ten dollar range. Therefore no one wanted the coins and price could not possible rise up from that point..oh wait.


Feel free to create Stolficoin. Good luck convincing the mining network which exists and is funded to maintain the bitcoin network to mine your altcoin. There is a reason why only one coin has any significant market capitalisation out of the hundreds of alt coins.
Troll on.

Under what authority does a central bank have to tell merchants how to sell their goods. Bitcoin is a form of barter. If fiat currency is not involved in a transaction then the central bank is not involved in that transaction. End of.

@_date: 2014-12-14 05:26:45
Well it does mean new coins each day. But the inflation rate falls every two years as the block reward halves. I.e it was previously much higher but tempered by new user adoption at lower prices. 
In fact compared to daily trading volume on the thin exchanges today new coins are almost noise. Still every little helps.

It is trivial to provide realtime block chain verifiable proof of reserves with bitcoin, unlike every other commodity in the world.
Would you invest tens of millions of dollars in return for digital tokens held by someone else without proof, regulated ETF or not. 
Simple maths shows the potential of an ETF on the price. If the twins divest of all 100k coins to new users then that is 35,000,000 dollars to buy the whole ETF at current prices. It isn't likely they will cash out entirely.
Currently investors in the West cannot invest in bitcoin as a speculative hedge in a tax efficient manner. That pool of capital with the potential to buy the ETF is a multitrillion dollar market.
If the ETF is approved then several more bubbles are highly likely.
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:54:24

Bitpay has cash reserves and it up to them if and when they choose to exchange bitcoins for cash externally.
Unlike market traders who simply wish to move the price to maximum effect, an honest seller like bitpay or coinbase wish to actually obtain the best price for selling bitcoins and likely sell most off exchange or internally in the case of coinbase, with on exchange sales being drip fed to cause the least damage to the price as possible. Afterall people spend more stuff with bitcoin when the price is rising.
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:48:02


@_date: 2014-11-01 20:15:47
It is a nice narrative to blame the defunct exchange Mt Gox for the last bubble. Shame there isn't a shred of evidence to prove or disprove that claim. It's downfall has harmed the price since I would wager.
Wallet numbers coming out of coinbase and blockchain.info show there are in fact millions of users looking to buy BTC. 
Whilst this bear market has poured a dose of cold water over the aspirations of those who bought in during the last bubble, the pattern which has driven the price higher each year has no reason at this stage to stall based on numbers of new adopters. 
The price rose 100x in one year. Of course it was going to correct fairly hard after that. The fact we are still above the previous ATH is pretty good i'd say. There was a lot of euphoria to work off. A glance at btctalk or shows near universal bearishness, always a good place to start the consolidation phase (into boredom) before real supply and demand can propel us higher again.

I don't think you understand market capitalisation. A relatively modest amount of money would move the overall capitalisation significantly upwards. You aren't seeing the market cap rise simply because the price per coin has not risen. Not sure you make much sense there.
If we assume that there are 500,000 users of Bitcoin globally (likely over estimate) then it is extremely easy to see where growth will come from.
As the currency gains utility and visibility across the Internet adoption will follow (see wallet users, transaction statistics). Not being able to see another 1 to 10 million people buying into Bitcoin in the next (manufactured) mania is myopic to say the least. 
Let me guess you thought exactly the same during the previous price surge, or the one before that, or the one before..
Bitcoin already has several 'killer apps'. For business it eliminates a significant % of transaction costs - a no brainer. For the end user it allows the use of sound mathematically scarce money and will increasingly operate as a store of value.

@_date: 2014-12-24 13:19:01
Not sure why you are here day after day posting negatively on every high visibility thread - it certainly isn't to provide anything useful to the world.
Hearing about something is far, far different from looking into moving money into something. 
There are only 650,000 bitcoin addresses with any meaningful value and you are telling me that globally there aren't enough people to drive the next price surge? I have at least four addresses myself in cold storage so realistically bitcoin is held by a very tiny number of people. But you have decided that everyone who is going to consider bitcoin has already bought it. Why? Because the price has slumped as it has after every single price surge the fledgeling currency has experienced before now. How stupid are you?
Silicon valley has pumped in nearly half a billion dollars of funding into bitcoin companies (not the currency) in the last year alone. You think these people do not know the current userspace in bitcoin? That is quite a lot of money to invest for a payment rail used actively by less than a million people globally.
Microsoft, Dell, Expedia, Newegg have publically adopted bitcoin purchases via BitPay - deliberately associating their brand with the brand of bitcoin in the process. Paypal is integrating it into it's systems. Why would Microsoft or Dell bother when the actual income from bitcoin users is likely to be a speck on their balance sheets for the year? Why take the risk?
Hint: the recent price weakness tells you absolutely nothing about where bitcoin is going to be in a year or the potential the currency has to disrupt the global payments and asset industries.
I'll leave you with a final point. If an ETF is approved which holds bitcoin then that will open the floodgates for a multi-trillion dollar capital pool to trickle slowly into bitcoin. A capital pool currently excluded from buying bitcoin in a tax efficient manner.

@_date: 2015-05-04 12:16:47
Oh no it is not.
I can agree with a friendly individual like you that a single bitcoin is worth a million dollars but that does not set the exchange price. The price of bitcoin is set by actual transactions taking place in the free market.
The value of a dollar is set by a tiny cabal of friendly central bankers who have the ability to conjure as many as they need out of thin air using an incredible machine called a printer. They control markets on a whim.
You might not like it, but no one is forced to use bitcoin and it has an exchange value bourne out of supply, demand, utility and scarcity.
The USD dollar used because people need to pay taxes with it or they are thrown in jail. Countries price oil in USD. If they don't they are bombed into pricing oil in USD.
@_date: 2015-05-04 08:32:27

This is about scaling bitcoin for the future where it can function as a world wide ledger. And yes that is inevitably going to lead to centralisation. Satoshi predicted centralisation of mining.

Except your argument is completely wrong. The price of a bitcoin is not really related to the utility of the currency - it never has been, and isn't likely to be for quite a number of years.
The price is set by speculation that bitcoin is a digital asset which will appreciate over time. People hold and purchase bitcoin in the main as a potential speculative store of gaining value. You don't seem to understand that. The coming move in bitcoin is likely to blind side you.
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:53:34
Patience is a virtue.
It takes effort to learn about bitcoin. The reasons why it is better than all pre-existing forms of money are hard to grasp by a populace that in general doesn't even understand inflation or where their money originates.
Furthermore, there has been a lot of negative mainstream media attention about it which is the only encounter average joe will have any recollection of previously.
The general public implicitly understood money until 1971. They will again.

The number is far far greater. (IMO)
Consider how many coins are actually used to set the price on exchanges (the 'float') is a maximum of a few hundred thousand coins and probably far lower.
Bitcoin will ultimately have the most incredible utility as an internet currency. But the current use case is overwhelmingly a store of speculative value.

Two points:
1) look at the volume across the exchanges - hint &gt;100,000 coins. Next look at the daily block reward = 3600 coins. 
2) if you had to sell to keep a massive data center from going bankrupt would you a) sell your coins OTC or on exchange gradually or b) dump 5,000 coins on the market driving the price down several % in a few seconds and causing the market to sell off?

The same is true for any commodity or share. The price is an illusion resting upon the majority of holders not selling at the same time.

Thought experiment.
Have 50 million dollars, want to get into bitcoin. If you buy on exchange and drip feed in it will take months to build a position without lifting the exchange price. 
How about buying 10 million dollars off exchange then dumping them on exchanges at technically important moments and keeping momentum downwards. Manipulate the price lower by 50% then buy with 40 million dollars off exchange in a big OTC trade from a miner or early adopter. Then pump the price on the exchanges with the cash from your dumping manipulation.

Traders can profit from a falling price as well as a rising price. If you think something will drop you can borrow lots of it and then sell it in the open market. That is called a short position. If the price drops and you buy it back lower then you keep the difference and return the original commodity minus a small interest fee. 
The OP picture shows that there are 25,000 bitcoin which have been borrowed and sold into the open market. They need to be bought back and this process, if disorderly, can lead to something called a squeeze where the price rises rapidly.
Large numbers of short positions like this are used to manipulate the price of a commodity (say gold or silver) down by giving a false estimation of actual supply to the market.
The price could still fall further but this looks bullish to me in the short term and could become extremely bullish if the price starts to rise rapidly generating a squeeze, though this may not happen.
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:47:36

@_date: 2015-05-23 12:45:47
I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how market capitalisation works. 
If a million speculators want to buy 10,000 dollars each of bitcoin the price the market capitalisation isn't 10,000 x 10,000!
I mentioned previously that the 'float' to set the price is only a few hundred thousand coins (being generous). In that context if only a few hundred thousand new buyers enter the market then the price will soar, or in the same way drop with falling demand. This is partly the reason for the incredible volatility of bitcoin - the price is set by supply and demand over time, within the constaints of the growing coin supply.
I think you should look back through at the multi year bitcoin log price chart and consider the existence of things like the hype cycle.
I consider bitcoin a powerful assymetric bet. You can only lose what you invest - but the gains are potentially massive.

Just because an exchange is running a fractional reserve, that doesn't mean that it is insolvent necessarily, nor that cash withdrawals won't work.
Let's be frank. People who make money from the price of bitcoin falling need it to start going down soon. The reason being that the magical logarithmic (down) trendline is fast approaching the current price. If the price were to continue to move sideways for another three months then we would just drift out of this bear market technically. If we move up slightly from here ($280's) then we break out and lots of buying will occur.
Technical traders are keeping their eyes firmly fixed on that line. So are the speculators who today are still short 24000 contracts on the exchange bitfinex. Whoever sold 6000 coins in three minutes on bitfinex today did so to drive the price lower.
More fun and games in this captured market.

No they were hacked and had 5 million dollars stolen. They have been open with no issue for five years and have relaunched within a couple of days of a catastrophic breach. They have made everyone whole.
How could they possibly not be insolvent and running a fractional reserve? Well they have 10 million dollars in VC funding from pantera. Oh and the founders have made 25 million dollars running the exchange since 2011.
But please continue to preach what they must do. Seems to me they are doing just fine.

Prior to 1971 we were on a gold standard. Going back further people understood implicitly the value of money and the importance of gold and scarcity therein.
What is to say that going forward a tech savvy generation will not rediscover the same attributes in bitcoin?

Have you checked  or  or 
@_date: 2015-05-06 10:10:51
I think you have inadvertently proven bitcoin is doing fabulously. 
It is a private currency in few hands at this point with a tiny market cap, yet accounted for 1% of your sales last year.
It is far, far, far, far, far less than 1% of the fiat money space in terms of capitalisation.
Revise your expectations.

@_date: 2015-01-14 05:49:52
You, along with lots of this sub seem to think that the price of a bitcoin is related to the cost of mining. It isnt. 
Miners may compete for the block reward and spend a lot on fancy machines to do the job better than each other. But the market will only bear what it values the bitcoin price as which is currently 215 dollars. 
If centralised miners cannot obtain coins profitably then they will stop and the network hashrate will fall.
@_date: 2015-05-18 00:17:03
Sad to say it but the block reward is now almost entirely irrelevent to the price of bitcoin.
The price isn't set on exchange by miners.
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:54:21
Why are only miners running full nodes?
And no, as usual you are wrong. Users give the currency exchange value and if bad actors attempt to change the basic rules of the system then the market will devalue bitcoin to zero.
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:40:04
You say it is too low. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:11:05
You are pathetic. That is all.

This may finally signal the move towards US regulated exchanges that bitcoin needs going forward. 
I predict that within a year the price will be set in the US. 
Sure, these cowboy exchanges may continue to operate - but they won't set the price anymore..

Whilst the service being totally free is awesome. It would be better if they implemented it with a decent portal showing top streams by most viral or trending or whatever..by offering users a login and free btc to watch to get the hang of it with easy integration to circle or coinbase or lb.com or something..

It's 72% now in favour of Classic. Expect a lot of PR and and attacks on Classic from the small block community. No one likes having their toys removed.
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:57:56
It reads like economic reality. 
Bitcoin investment drives the exchange price. A massive roadblock to progress is about to be lifted and despite attempts to push the price lower (traders and those wishing to dissuade miners from making the switch) a massive relief rally is actually the likely outcome. 
Bitcoin will have proven it can circumvent captured governance by people who have goals not aligned with the economic majority.
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:04:53
Classic is open source. They can jump onboard if they want.
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:25:02
If miners try to change the money supply then users would sell and miners would be left with a worthless token.
You either fail to understand economics or bitcoin, or both.

Have you heard of Comical Ali?
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:57:40
Haha. Pull the other one. 
Increasing the max blocksize is trivial to implement as XT demonstrates. 
The Core developers are steadfastly working themselves into an irrelevent side note in the history of bitcoin development.
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:56:09
How about refuting some arguments?
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:58:13
I already do..
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:58:48
That actually is a fantastic idea.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:31:29
Congestion like this simply demonstrates that the blocksize must be raised.
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:32:31
Or we could just implement blocksize increases and let this 'annoyer' waste funds to their hearts content without filling up the blocks and interfering with regular bitcoin transactions. 
Miners do not need higher transaction fees at this stage. They obtain the block reward which is a massive subsidy.

Gavin and Satoshi know how bitcoin works..
If they supported bitcoin blocksize scaling (which is trivial to implement) then I don't think we would be having this conversation..

Bitcoin isn't deflationary. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:34:35
So your argument is we should continue to have bitcoin open to attack by a small adversary so we don't get attacked by a powerful adversary.
Go logic.
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:30:31
Yay, let's make bitcoin more expensive than legacy fiat systems, let's keep bitcoin as a high value / low transaction volume blockchain and sell our souls to the bankers!

@_date: 2015-07-07 15:11:08
If it becomes economically unfeasible to attack the network then of course it fixes the problem. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:47:39
How is arguing for an obvious improvement to bitcoin (in the face of an ongoing successful bitcoin transaction ddos attack) in anyway FUD?
The only impediment to bitcoin growth is the small cabal of programmers who think they get to decide on the direction bitcoin takes. 
Hint: they don't.
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:57:01


Would be nice if they answered any questions that are posed regarding this debate. Or came clean about any pecuniary conflicts of interest which are at play.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:30:57
Yes but the point is that if blocks are full then that means valid transactions are not propagated despite paying a toll to do so. This leads to a bidding war which benefits only miners. That is not a solution - that is the step towards pricing bitcoin out of the reach of every day purchases!
Why make bitcoin more expensive for the end user than it needs to be? Especially when it can be kept inexpensive for many years to come (block reward subsidy is still enormous) by simply increasing the blocksize?
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:42:57
Oh stop trying to differentiate between spam and valid traffic. What is it with you and censorship. :)
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:50:20
Welcome to the discussion. 
The view of no bitcoin user in this ecosystem is irrelevant.
I am not searching for credibility. I am seeking to open up the debate which has been stifled by parties with obvious conflicts of interest thus far.
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:49:09
Amen brother..
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:34:16
If the fee paying spam is designed to fill blocks at 1mb, but spam is too expensive to fill blocks at 8mb or 20mb for any length of time, then raising the blocksize will directly reduce the amount of spam.
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:12:06
No guarantee. But it forces an attacker to expend enormous resources to cripple bitcoin, which in turn strengthens the network further.
Not being able to repulse an attack from an all powerful adversary is not a reason to fail to try and secure it against almost all other attackers along the same vector.
EDIT: lol at whoever downvoted this
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:16:54
There are tens or even hundreds of thousands of bitcoin users. A few vocal developers is a cabal, yes. 
Still waiting for those refutations..I'll won't hold my breath.
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:16:02
Yes most bitcoin users do. 
Hence the overwhelming support for raising the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:01:06
Yeah and thus far there have been precisely zero arguments mooted showing that bitcoin cannot scale with its current model in terms of bandwidth electricity and storage.
This is a political/ideological decision. 
EDIT: Hoping for a rebuttal here..
@_date: 2015-07-03 06:52:30
Here comes more of the Peter Todd brigade, working tirelessly to worsen bitcoin. 
No one wants this change.

@_date: 2015-07-03 16:36:04
If you really had bought coins and sold them for 900 (which you clearly have not) then you wouldn't be trolling this forum quite so hard.
You would have profited heavily off the last of a series of price surges/bubbles and would recognise that technically bitcoin is probably at its best 'buy' since November 2013.
What people do with their money is up to them. Or are we to believe that bitcoin is for l33t traders like yourself to purchase?
Now stop telling porkies and jog on.
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:59:10
And who gets to decide what is spam and what is a valid fee paying transaction? 
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:50:25
Well it seems to be that bitcoin is to become a service / base layer upon which other side chains and centralised off chain services are linked.
The impression I have is they hope to keep bitcoin as a background ledger servicing banks and other centralised third party (must be trusted)  off chain companies.
Perhaps it is a coincidence that the vocally opposed to blocksize increases are also employed by companies involved in sidechain development such as blockstream. If it isn't a coincidence then it is a massive conflict of interest.
I want bitcoin to be open to the whole world as a global trustless peer to peer payment network. It should be as cheap as technology allows and I believe we should be trying to make bitcoin as mainstream and accessible as possible rather than keeping it as a backdoor financial layer.
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:17:48
There is a broad consensus amongst everyone except core devs working for blockstream. The community overwhelmingly support block size increase and scalability.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:54:41
Myself and thousands of bitcoin users troubled by lack of any public consensus between developers around the blocksize issue, of course compounded by the recent transaction DDOS, perhaps also worried by a complete difference of opinion between yourself and pretty much all other stakeholders in the bitcoin ecosystem were kind of hoping for a reasoned discussion from you or an actual bitcoin core developer rather than a one line dismissal.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:27:48
Right on. 
That is why a fee based market place doesnt work if there is more demand for transactions than space.
Why are the core devs not able to see or comment on this?
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:05:22
Bitcoin is inflationary. It is just that the inflation rate will continue to fall exponentially in the year ahead.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:39:44
When are you finally going to realise that you don't get to decide what is spam and what is valid traffic.
After the gentoo linux debacle I would have thought you got the message.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:20:04
Only one chain will survive with monetary value. That chain will be bitcoin. The remnant chain will simply be a digital curio.
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:19:29
Of course you don't..
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:20:52
I softened this post a little, but you are probably right about that.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:12:54
So we all want the cap raised. Why you hating on a guy with less money than you?
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:17:27
Excellent post.
With the usual suspects either paid by or cozying up to off chain / side chain projects I would be interested to hear a response.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:50:31
What is more important is that it is 5 million a month in bitcoin. Which is starting at that level to be a significant portion of mining supply.
It would be possible then to identify who is doing this attack.
Moreover at those costs only a nation state or Bank would be able to continue such an attack.
The block size must be raised as soon as possible before bitcoin transactions are delayed in a public fashion.
@_date: 2015-07-06 10:26:36
1) Not sure why you think that is in any way relevent.
2) How are you enjoying that sub 1% interest, troll? :)
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:26:41
Agreed on all fronts.
@_date: 2015-07-09 10:14:04
Fair enough. It isn't either or I suppose. 
But raising the blocksize makes such an attack economically non-trivial except for a nation state or financial institution.
Hardening btc and allowing it to scale probably does need both bigger blocksizes and a variable fee structure eventually.
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:50:21
When evidence showing bitcoin doesn't scale is presented we can end this debate.
Until then it is up to those who oppose a trivial change to the codebase to explain why they are stopping bitcoin expanding.
EDIT: holding my breath again..
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:43:19
Actually that is the price of coin distribution. Nothing to do with decentralisation. 
And for the end user it is still cheaper to use bitcoin than fiat in most cases.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:55:51
So your argument is that only core developers know enough to contribute to the debate about the future of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:45:20
Interestingly the software used is suitable for installation on machines running Windows, MacOs and Linux.
Time to get a new machine again.
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:13:32
Which is interesting because there is overwhelming community and industry support for increasing the blocksize.
If they don't play ball then bitcoin will fork and they can pass coins back and forth to one another (and double spend to their heart's content) on the old worthless chain.
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:53:53
Why should users pay more to get on the bus? Why not just let more people in to travel for the same cost as before?
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:32:10
Spam costs money.
Increasing the blocksize is about preserving the network against disruption. As business comes to rely on the bitcoin chain going forward that is going to be very important. 
'Just raise fees' is not close to a solution.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:23:28
What are you talking about? Bitcoin has forked before and will fork again numerous times. Disaster has been averted each time.
As long as a pre-planned fork occurs then stakeholders can prepare for the transition. 
No need to be melodramatic about this.
@_date: 2015-07-09 00:59:40
That's the point. They aren't working on it. 
After a thousand posts about blocksizes the bitcoin network is being successfully attacked for a pittance to the stage that previously functional services such as Wallets and exchanges are no longer able to transact without modification.
Arrogant twits like you stating things like 'just raise the fee' or 'this is terribly complex and you don't understand' is deliberately ignoring actual issue and is part of the reason why threads like this are upvoted onto the front page in the first place.
Novelty is irrelevant. Getting bitcoin through this impasse isn't.
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:43:14
I don't think you know how markets work..
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:35:42
Why are they opposing blocksize growth?
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:23:38
How do you know what is spam and what is a valid transaction?
We know how Luke-Jr decides: arbitrarily.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:54:48
Please. The larger bitcoin gets the greater the non-techie:techie ratio becomes. That process is only going to continue.
If people are bleating on here in anger about the direction bitcoin is taking then that reflects a failure of communication between the devs and the rest of the ecosystem. 
I personally think the cap should be scaled up. But if there are good arguments as to why that is not the case then they should be made in blog posts or on here. 
If the devs are riven with disagreement on the fundamental direction bitcoin for non technical reasons (ideological) then it is even more important that communication and discussion is opened up to stakeholders in the ecosystem.
Now perhaps I am biased because I have heard arguments from pro blocksize increase developers Gavin, Hearn, Garzik. But we aren't hearing anything from the no camp to justify their stance. Worse we hear whispers of conflicts of interest and now the network is under attack.
This situation could be diffused with a few blog posts setting out their vision for btc over the next year or two. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:41:35
That is some pent up bitterness. 
I have several hundred btc. I want the cap raised. GTFO.
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:28:44
VC's havent invested three quarters of a billion dollars in bitcoin companies so that bitcoin can become a settlement layer used by banks and financial institutions. The speculative value of bitcoin is in part driven by the expectation that bitcoin will be used by a much larger audience in the future.
Satoshi's original vision was for bitcoin to scale.
The dev's who oppose this vision need to explain why technically it isn't possible with proof, or GTFO and let other core developers implement the changes that the community and industry want.
Those who don't agree with bitcoin becoming more mainstream and more widely used are free to sell their coins and play around with one of the hundreds of altcoins in existence.
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:21:42

@_date: 2015-04-04 13:30:15


I am not sure why you have such distaste for the 99.5% of the currency held speculatively and not traded. It is holders who give the currency value, not traders. It is holders who buy the mining supply.
Traders are a zero sum game. Ticks on the back of the market hoping to profit from price movements. Generally day traders lose money, generally to large speculators who can move the bitcoin price at will. 


Leverage was around in the last bubble, where movements both up and down exceeded $100 regularly.
You seem to have a one-sided view of the market where the price cannot rise ('pump') quickly or far. Bit shortsighted looking at the multi-year price charts. It suggests you fail to understand that supply and demand are the only metrics that matter in this and every market.
You have no idea where the price will be this evening, next week or next year. Hilarious to hear you braying otherwise.

Upwards trending from numerous countries there. I didn't see China, though.
The price is easily manipulated on exchange. We just need US regulated exchanges for some real price discovery (not swamped with leverage based manipulation) and the halving will hopefully lead to some price appreciation.

@_date: 2015-04-08 20:54:08
Incorrect. Bitcoin derives its monetary value from what the exchange price is.
Bitcoin is/was and will be for a long time supported by speculative investment. In this respect it is identical to gold being dug up out of the ground, buffed until nice and shiny and put in a bank vault.
Whilst the utility of the currency is improving constantly, and the usage seems to be rising that is actually not required at all for it to maintain or increase in monetary value.
For a mod on here you aren't very good at this.

@_date: 2015-04-03 13:32:17
The point is more that miners do not need to sell.
You have magicked up a number as a 'cost' to maintain the network where no such cost exists. 
Mining and associated costs are a choice taken by miners and cost the network nothing.
Miners can choose to sell their coins for the exchange price if they like. But they do not need to. In fact it makes little sense with coin supply falling exponentially to sell off your coins in early years.
Hence large mining companies being heavily funded years into the future.
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:55:18
Fascinating though this rampant speculation is, I noticed we are in 2015 when I checked my calendar this morning, not 2013, or even 2011.

@_date: 2015-04-02 19:11:01
You still have it backwards. 
Miners suck nothing from the system. They are the designated distributors of inflation on an exponentially falling basis.
The only cost to the user of bitcoin is the mild inflation of their own bitcoin holdings by new coins entering supply. This to date has been massively offset by the arrival of new users buying bitcoin. In any case the block reward is exponentially falling to nothing and from next year will become progressively less and less relevent as it approaches zero.
The block reward occurs irrespective of price.
It is common knowledge that some of the largest mining groups do not sell their coins and are capitalised with VC funding for years out into the future.
Your argument that the bitcoin network 'needs' money to keep it going is spurious. A single laptop could keep the network running if need be.

I agree in principle. But opening a 10,000 bitcoin short when the orderbook has 6000 buy orders is simple manipulation (what drove the price from 250 to 160 on bitfinex recently) and is not price discovery.

@_date: 2015-04-08 00:02:22
So your argument is based on ignoring the next 100 years of falling block rewards, instead stopping the block reward immediately, and scaling up the transactions required based on the value of a bitcoin today - when the network is still nascent - not in 2033.

Oh and without progress on bitcoin scaling in the near term the bitcoin value proposition collapses entirely. First mover advantage is all bitcoin has left now. The value of the chain and the currency unit is based upon expectation of future use cases which are rapidly dwindling in the face of pseudo expert bs halting development from the likes of Peter Todd and yourself.

In normal markets where manipulative trades are rolled back leverage smooths out trading. But just look at when bitfinex allowed a 10,000 short to wipe out the orderbook and smash the price from 250 to 160. Ridiculous and massively increased volatility in a totally manipulative fashion - that wasn't real selling, a purely artificial deliberate overwhelming of supply. It should be rolled back. Just as trades during DDOS should be rolled back. 
These events keep big money out of bitcoin and damage it's function as a store of value. Bring on US exchanges with a market depth and culture to deal with such activity..

When the first few speculators see the halving is approaching and make their move what happens? The price rises and more speculators buy bitcoin. Which raises the price so more speculators see the price rising as the halving approaches closer and buy bitcoin, which raises the price and so..
The point being timing is a crucial aspect you entirely miss. 
The market is often wrong and constantly chsnging based upon the market participants views. There is no such thing as 'priced in' and preaching there is means you don't understand markets or the way people think.

What VISA can do at maximum burst speed is not relevent.
Also saying if we cannot immediately match VISA tps with bitcoin then scaling bitcoin is pointlesss just dumb. Obviously a decentralised system like bitcoin is going to underperform a centralised db like VISA. That is no reason to not scale bitcoin to allow the userbase to grow and encourage 3rd party permissionless usage on the blockchain.

Sure the way we scale is important. We don't want any more hardforks than necessary. But watching the limit reached does break the rules of bitcoin because it leads to dropped transactions and a rising transaction cost - none of which users or industry want.
Bitcoin managed fine with Gavin at the helm and Satoshi before him. Now we have self anointed bitcoin experts who couldn't organise a pissup in a brewery, dithering and delaying what is a simple code change.

You are right of course, it is only as hidden as long as the image is out of reach of someone looking for it, though offline in secure digital cold storage that would be fairly difficult to acquire.
As I said in the text I wouldn't recommend anyone actually use steganography to hide a bitcoin private key without being certain they know exactly what they are doing. 
Symmetrically encrypting the key first, using bip38 to add 2-factor or using multi-sig would make it more secure. In of itself steganography is just obfuscation rather than anything more elaborate.

Well the fact that testnet have been running with 8mb blocks using bip-101 and 10mb blocks with bitcoin-unlimited is sort of a clue that it will work.
The inside joke is every single Core developer and member of Blockstream already know that bitcoin will scale easily up 10x from here with no difficulty whatsoever. The problem is that they cannot leverage 3rd party off chain for profit solutions if people can easily transact on the blockchain for the next 5 years by changing a single line of code (reverting it even!). 
Far better to be building something or maintaining the status of bitcoin expert by adding things like RBF that 99% of the ecosystem expressly do not want in any form. It's not like the bitcoin Core code was originally written in 2009 and has undergone only minor revisions in the last few years..

Larger blocks make spam attacks far more expensive because to fill up blockspace and push the network to capacity takes a far larger number of transactions, each of which have to pay a fee for the pleasure.
Smaller blocks can be filled up with transactions more easily over and above the typical daily transaction load and when the influx of transactions is greater than the max blocksize (exceeds the network blockwidth) then becomes a mempool attack.
Not sure really why you are suggesting I have this backwards, though I'd be happy to be corrected.

You think bitcoin has value if the transaction fee is 37 dollars?
The problem with this settlement layer nonsense is that the speculative value attached to the bitcoin exchange price is pricing in wider adoption potential in the future. 
If the lunatics actually take charge of the asylum and continue pushing to limit bitcoin and keep it a niche financial product then it will lose it's speculative value to another crypocurrency that isn't hindered by such limitations. 
A billion dollars of VC funding and miners future income depends on bitcoin having value. Hence either 'core' adapts and becomes a mainstream implementation of scaling bitcoin or another reference client will be forked and become bitcoin instead, but this time without 'core' developers and aligned with the interests of the bitcoin community and stakeholders.

You were banging on in a rather one sided fashion about Gavin having conflicts of interest whilst ignoring the giant elephant in the room which on this sub is a dangerous topic to broach.
And anyway, is it really a conflict of interest to want to scale bitcoin with an on chain solution? A true conflict of interest would be to deliberately hinder growth of bitcoin with the pretense of maintaining decentralisation, whilst simultaneously working for a company which aims to profit directly from taking transactions off chain.
The entire reasoning and doublethink exhibited by the small clique of small block proponents can be summarised with the fine words of Upton Sinclair,

If transactions are fee paying then bloat is a non-issue and simply scaremongering as an attack vector. Pay for a transaction and it is valid!
Take the edge case where a theoretical dynamic flexible blocksize is employed where the network simply accepts any and all transactions with a minimum fee. Yes of course a spam attack is possible and for a time the blockchain would rapidly increase in size with temporary disruption as the network reaches 'blockwidth' capacity. But the attacker would just as rapidly lose their ability to maintain such an attack as their funds evaporated. An attacker could try this but it would be an extremely expensive exercise in futility.
The same attack by an adversary where a blocksize limit is enforced with an active synchronous fee market - not so much.
I agree there are lots of issues which are important and will likely need changes going forward: node incentivisation, block propagation optimisation, blockchain pruning. 
Side chains and lightning are exciting but have the potential to disrupt bitcoin and pervert the economic incentives which maintain bitcoin's value. Plus they are vapourware currently.
Oh and there is nothing malicious in wanting bitcoin to scale in current form as far as technology will allow!

The lower the blocksize the easier it is to temporarily exceed the meagre TPS the network currently supports. This results in a growing backlog in the mempool during a spam attack which apparently crashed 1000 nodes. (Losing 1000 nodes as a result of hardware limitations is fine according to Todd, but losing a few nodes globally as a result of slightly increased node bandwidth requirements is evil centralisation!!)
If we assume 120,000 transactions a day currently that is approximately 1.4 tps. This leaves roughly 2 tps leeway. An attacker can fill remaining blocks to exceed the roughly 3.3 tps network capacity at 1mb by flooding the network with transactions each paying 0.0002 fee for a cost of .11 btc per block or 16.4btc a day. 
If the block size were 8mb then the attacker would have to expend ((7 * 1024)+572 * 0.0002 = 1.54 btc a block, 222.9 btc a day) considerably more. Or at 20mb ((19 * 1024)+572*0.0002 = 4 btc a block, 576 btc a day) even more.
Keep up the BS.

Zeroconf is actually perfectly safe and always has been as long as you understand the risk as a merchant. It is trivial to wait for a transaction to propagate across the network in a matter of seconds. 
A double spend attempt can be trivially detected in this way.

This has been merged without any consensus beyond the tiny cabal of developers with a severe conflict of interest by working for blockstream and a supine lead developer.

@_date: 2015-10-10 18:12:19




Yes it does - as my simple worked through calculation demonstrates.
You can keep parroting the same tripe but a blind man can see that if network traffic rises in terms of tps and exceeds what the blocksize limit is currently enforcing that the mempool will bloat up with a backlog of transactions. 
Ergo if we lower the block size then it be considerably easier to exceed the network tps, or if we increase the blocksize then then it becomes more difficult for an adversary. 
So far your stunning solution seems to be limiting the mempool whilst not acknowledging that the only reason the mempool can balloon up to hog so much memory is because too few transactions are being written to the blockchain (..because the max blocksize is limited).
Anyway jog on.
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:50:10
1) increasing the blocksize x8 can be supported by the overwhelming majority of nodes globally. 
2) vast majority of hashing security is paid for by the block reward, transactions make up only a tiny portion of income ergo it is better to increase number of transactions than simply kill the network attractiveness at a stage when it is unnecessary by implementing 'fee pressure' (why not just say rises?)
3) actually the blocksize being limited in a hardcap fashion rather than rising flexibly is encouraging spam attacks and keeping it rather cheap to perform..not sure how anyone could suggest the opposite. 
Furthermore we are now in the ludicrous situation where rather than increase the max blocksize in a flexible fashion related to network transaction load, instead we have 1000+ nodes dropping off the network due to ballooning mempool queues. But this is ok because it fits into the BS narrative for bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-11-07 00:48:25
As soon as another implementation of the original reference client referred to as Core (actually just a bug fixed and improved version of the original code written by Satoshi) gains miner and industry support then we will just move forward without those holding bitcoin static.

Well those of us who see potential in bitcoin see bitcoin being used in exchange for goods and services - I.e retail.
You seem to live in a cloud cuckoo land where bitcoin has no use except as a store of value, not realising that bitcoin being widely used as an internet currency in the future is precisely where it gets value today.

Couldn't be more wrong. Limiting the blocksize actually makes transaction spam extremely cheap and simple as an attack vector.

There is quite a difference between miners receiving 3600 bitcoins a day and 'miners as a whole getting 900,000 dollars a day'.
The network has mining costs to maintain at a given hash rate, but thinking that is the same as (exchange price of one bitcoin * total daily supply) is pretty absurd.
You don't seem to have demonstrated any relationship between the price of a bitcoin and mining costs. I am not surprised as there isn't one which can be easily described despite what you spout on here.
@_date: 2015-03-29 16:44:02
So you are ignoring a) the exponentially falling coin supply and b) randomly plucking numbers out of the air for network costs. 
Prove the network costs 900,000 dollars a day to maintain. Demonstrate a relationship between the price of a bitcoin and mining costs please.
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:48:31
Patently false.
If the number of miners increased tenfold today then the costs of the network would rise commensurately. The exchange price would not be directly effected. The block reward would continue unabated at 3600 coins per day.
If the number of miners falls slightly then the costs of running the mining network would drop slightly. The exchange price would be unaffected.
In both cases the daily block reward would continue to follow the exponential schedule and currently output 3600 fresh coins into circulation. The block reward is a distribution mechanism for coins.
Bitcoin mining has no direct effect on the bitcoin price. Bitcoin exchanges don't care about mining difficulty. 
Instead the bitcoin price has an indirect effect upon the cost of mining. If the bitcoin price rises as it has in recent years then miners will chase the block reward and mining difficulty will rise (see recent charts of network hash rate or mining difficulty). Theoretically if the bitcoin price craters then miners should switch off as their income will drop.
However things aren't that simple.
@_date: 2015-03-19 09:34:08

@_date: 2015-11-29 20:04:00
No the narrative from core devs, hangers on and blockstream employees is that bitcoin is terribly, terribly complicated. You can't just read the white paper and understand it. You need to be a core developer to understand the sheer complexity which you probably cannot comprehend because you aren't a core developer.
In fact these issues are so complicated and impossibly difficult to understand that you probably think the following:
1)limiting the blocksize to 1mb despite incessantly rising transaction volumes
2)increasing transaction fees via an unnecessary fee market
3)the introduction of opt-in RBF (before it is suddenly default Core policy in the eventual fork to increase the blocksize and get LN functional)
 are all bad things. If only you were a self anointed 'bitcoin expert' and could grasp such concepts!

You are over thinking this.
The price will move in relation to the halving at a point between now and the halving. An increase in on-exchange demand will lead to a price rise, this will lead to further buying which will raise the price higher, leading to further buying because everyone knows the halving is coming.

Blocksizes have never been an issue before now. Previously when the 1mb limit was introduced it was hundreds of times higher than the daily average block transaction numbers - no longer true. Now any pickup or continuation of the trend of increasing transaction numbers means the network cannot function as is any longer.
The solution so far from the Core developers is to make transactions more expensive but keep the limit in place. 
Sorry but that isn't going to cut it, as they are finding out from industry now openly siding with other reference implementations which do appreciate this problem.

If bitcoin succeeds and user adoption increases then the price of a bitcoin will rise substantially. It could fail instead. Holding the currency is speculating upon the outcome.

@_date: 2015-10-12 12:14:35
The only reason we have a mem pool problem is because we don't lay down transactions to the chain fast enough.
Your solution is to raise fees for everyone. 
Next the spammer raises fees. 
Your solution is to raise fees for everyone.. 
Literally the only reason these 'attacks' continue is because they are extremely cheap to perform. Raising the blocksize increases the costs substantially such that only an extremely well capitalised adversary could still hurt the nextwork. At 20mb it becomes prohibitive. 
The key point being that just because the network can scale up to take spammers money and then as transaction rates fall when he runs out of money the network carries on as before just with a slightly larger chain, oh and low transaction fees intact.

No. 
Arbitrage means that if the price of a commodity rises in China compared to the US the following occurs: people buy in US (where the price is low) to sell in China (where the price has risen).
This process means that exchange prices gradually move towards each other eliminating this profit opportunity (until the next major market movement).

Clearly bitcoin has an image problem.
I think as the little 'b' appears gradually on every website selling services it will become part of internet culture.
For merchants and business bitcoin is a slam dunk. But I think we should be educating the masses about the monetary properties of bitcoin - frictionless, **limited by design**, only 1 year left before inflation drops to 5%, only 5 years before 2.5%, 9 years before 1.25% etc..
Either way it won't matter. If the common man doesn't realise the benefit of bitcoin then it will simply find usage as a digital asset class like gold instead.
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:07:51
If you spent five minutes reading about bitcoin you would know it has exponentially falling inflation built in. 
Inflation is currently around 10%, from 2016 it will be 5%, from 2020 2.5%, 2024 1.25% etc..
Bitcoin isn't an asset class for the public right now because it is concentrated in too few hands. As we move forward as long as it exists it will gradually become stable and hopefully emerge as a global transactional currency and store of value. It is the best form of money ever created and since the gold standard is the only money given value by the people rather than the barrel of the gun.

The view is that increasing the maxblocksize limit risks centralisation and this will prevent nodes being run in outer mongolia by peasants on 9600 baud modems.
8mb blocks have been tested without issue on testnet - and as the network seems to be growing organically it is likely that such a high blocksize would not be met for a long time - but the current limit will be hit soon with negative consequences for bitcoin users and stakeholders in the ecosystem.
The honest answer is that there is a massive conflict of interest at the heart of Core development, where Block stream employees are preventing the max blocksize being raised because they have a direct pecuniary interest in working for a company hoping to sell off chain for profit payment solutions. They ultimately hope to profit through this and are happy that bitcoin remains a niche settlement layer, a virtual gold with few tps and relatively high transaction costs. Interestingly this also fits with what the conventional central and private banking system want bitcoin to become - i.e. nothing which can encroach on their mainstream remit, a digital curio and nothing more.
