so what are they going to do in the instance of the normal trader?  they buy their btc from coinbase lets say.  then go to a exchange and or shapeshift and trade their coins for other crypto all year.  
how the heck are they supposed to keep track of all those trades.  sometimes hundreds of trades a day on poloniex for example.  Or would they just want what you started with and tax what you ended up with?

@_date: 2017-02-17 07:47:58
there might be problems if your btc is "cleaned" i think right?  such as having btc being swapped out for other btc at shapeshift or something.  which that btc could be "stolen"  or coming from bad people.  Did you clean your btc?
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:42:41

this just proves bitcoin isnt ready yet.  i love crypto currency but i wish more people would create new businesses and startup ideas with incorporating btc and other crypto.  be very honest with yourself right  now the biggest use case in western society is just speculation.
hence the EU cashing out article.
it sounds like crap to btc lovers I get it.  the whole idea that this is replace fiat, thats if even possible way way wayyyyy down the line.  20+ years.  Because no one is innovating with it.  why would the average joe use it, how does it solve a problem the avg person has with currency ??  so far all the layman knows is that its volatile as fuck.  he thinks about it for 2 seconds and moves on.
We crypto enthusiasts need to be proactive and not sit back for btc to go to 10000.  we need to be starting online businesses etc.  like what kim from kim.com is doing with his new platform.  other than that its all talk and fairy tale dreams.  it takes work for this to get mainstream.  
until then its just going to be used speculatively and in countries that have no choice and this might be a viable option for them because their govt fiat is inflated 500% etc.  Just being realistic.  people dream about this "new society"  no more bank blah blah yea it looks amazing but no work is being done to make that a reality.

*"Baron Rothschild, an 18th century British nobleman and member of the Rothschild banking family, is credited with saying that "The time to buy is when there's blood in the streets."*
*He should know. Rothschild made a fortune buying in the panic that followed the Battle of Waterloo against Napoleon. But that's not the whole story. The original quote is believed to be "Buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own."*
*This is contrarian investing at its heart - the strongly-held belief that the worse things seem in the market, the better the opportunities are for profit.*
*Most people only want winners in their portfolios, but as Warren Buffett warned, "You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus." In other words, if everyone agrees with your investment decision, then it's probably not a good one."*

This actually made me angry how much money you had and because of this you just didn't care and made foolish investments. But I will say imo the market cap is only going to get higher. Just hold these and I believe for the most part you will gain back all these and possibly a bit more if you just patiently hold for the next year. Or at least come back closer to normal. Then you can sell for a minimal loss. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:33:08

did you pay taxes, did coin base provide paper work or did you file it on your taxes for capital gains?
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:03:48
has anyone withdrawn from their coinbase or gemini accounts into their banks?  If yes did you have any issues?, how many times have you done this and how much?  
im curious if people have issues cashing out btc to their bank accounts.  I've heard of banks closing their accounts due to bitcoin use.  both sending large amounts to coinbase type institutions and back.  Bank wanted no part of it.

yuan was bumped up due to chinese central bank trying to slow its falling value.  chinese went off their offshore investments to go back to the temporary rising yuan prices.  happened last december as well.
yuan will fall again, the government is cracking down but it won't do much.  i would buy more crypto now but i have no cash lol.

just buy a little every month depending on how much you want to invest.  just do 100 a month or 2 months what ever you are comfortable with.  for now the price will go up down dont lose your head about what price to buy at.

cash out at 5k and invest in crypto all time lows. when you multiply that a few mil get out 50% pay taxes, get into traditional investments live off the interest
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:52:36
if they saw lots of money coming in they would file sar suspicious activity report with out your knowledge to the irs.  things like that are standard operating procedure for banks as they follow the 'know your customer' rules.  there are some other files they can prepare and send off.  this is to fight against drug money, tax evasion, counter terrorism financing lmao, money laundering etc. 
even if you brought in money little by little that would set them off even more and then the irs would have cause to think you are trying to evade taxes by attempting to drip in funds thinking it wouldn't trigger any suspicion.  
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:15:55

these exchanges are still really vulnerable to word of mouth and reputation on the internet.  i say even if this doesnt work out just keep talking shit until they are forced to listen.  i mean on the forums, on reddit, on  blogs, until people know.  i mean other than taking them to court which is expensive as hell.  
i don't understand customer service should be a priority smh
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:47:55
how many times are you withdrawing to your bank?  I've heard of a lot of cases where the bank when they see that you are depositing money consistently they will file a SAR(suspicious activities report) without your knowledge.  its their Standard op procedure for things like that under the "know your customer" policy they follow.  doesn't matter if its a big deposit or some people think they get away by keeping the deposit under 10k or spliting them into smaller 1k deposits, which is even more suspicious and the IRS will charge you for tax evasion for depositing 1k increments in an attempt to evade.
Banks are afraid of dealing with money laundering, tax evasion etc especially when dealing with BTC which they have no idea if you are evading taxes with it or god knows, so instead sometimes they will flag your account and say we dont want your business.  They would rather not deal with the headache.  (most banks will have no idea what you are talking about if you mention btc or crypto at all)
I'd move to gemini, and if the bank was the issue change to credit union or btc friendly bank.  USAA actually integrates a bitcoin app for their customers, which shocked me.  they are a small veterans bank, but they are i think the only one that offers BTC app for their site to check your balance.

of course the government/corporations/banks own the media.  they can do as they please
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:28:01
this is a long term play in my opinion.  just buy one or two every quarter depending how much you are willing to spend.  you will be waiting 10+ years to really make something from it.  upside is nice though.  Obviously be willing to put in only what you are ok with losing as with any investment
@_date: 2016-12-30 06:07:41

so you mean a program would 'ice berg' trade in increments for you instead of dumping large orders on the market? same with buying? 
i'm not familiar with 'paint the tape' do you mean using programs to try to hide big buy orders by spacing them out more? obviously volume of orders go up but its less noticeable compared to a large buy order.

When you turn your BTC to USD thats when you pay taxes. You can find your transaction history on coinbase, gemini etc. If you did these transactions say person to person not on exchange, you need to keep track on a book to show IRS if they want the info. Lots of grey areas you can see. 
But one things for sure, better pay taxes or they can take all your shit lol.

I just started seeing this, i should sell everything on a wednesday then buy back Fri - Sat lmao.
Really wish some one who works in big data analytics company would keep track of all these market movements and variables. Put it through some searches and find some patterns we can use to understand market hikes and corrections better. Maybe we can buy and sell better using these numbers.

How the hell would they even know. What if I had it in alt currencies or USDT. WTF how about I lie and say I have none, what if I had btc then lost it all trading. How they gonna check lmao.

shapeshift had great customer service at least in my experience they were always prompt and genuinely wanted to help. customer service meant a lot to them.

yea no crap, the infrastructure for crypto currencies are almost none existent. there is no FDIC insurance, no real banking structure lmao what did you think was going to happen. This isn't even main stream yet. How did automobiles do when there were no such things as gas stations and tire centers or roads. what a clown experiment, thanks captain obvious

in regards to the comment, getting his coins off Polo how does Coinomi help. If you can't get it off polo it doesn't matter what wallet you want to put it into was the point. Unless you're saying, trading through coinomi bypasses this some how.
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:11:27
reason polo has so much volume is they don't let people take their money without jumping through hoops so people are forced to trade the money. assholes
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:26:54
yea say most people don't have any in those exchanges, they are being traded as alt currencies or in private wallets or in USDT. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:05:30
btc is gonna correct to 1800 lol then bounce back up. I would sell everything and buy in the dip. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:16:01
im confused, who gets to change bitcoins source code? It's an open source project? who accepts pull requests? Or am I wrong on how devs are working on btc.  There is a team that manages btc? who put them in that position, I thought we don't even know the creator.

So how can you unload your btc to USD at coinbase or gemini and into a bank? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:12:39
but they return the money you had in your checkings accounts right?
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:13:53
I don't understand, then do you have 2 types of bitcoin after this split? double the money? Can't be, just confused on how this will work out. I guess you have to pick which denomination you want?
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:47:40
Useful later how? Think about how many cryptos say 3 years back are non existent today. You can never be certain 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:02:50
gemini it's by the winklevoss twins from facebook
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:17:35
that sucks that means, you won't be able to exchange back to USD to your bank then what the heck is the point of btc lmao. Sure you can buy some stuff with a btc debit card or something but, what ever it is how you get to spend your btc its a pain in the ass not worth using. That's what they want.
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:07:52
if the coin splits does that mean you have double the amount of money?
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:14:18
is the reason you get black listed because you dont use 2fa? I heard people use vpns and its fine. I have no idea what triggers them from black listing your account like that. It sounds so random wtf. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:47:20
hold on for dear life
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:52:36
how does this help?
