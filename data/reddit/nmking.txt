You realize you only have about 2 more months if you're lucky for your zooming out 1 year logic to work?

Hodling is a terrible strategy for currency

What else do you think the point of the meme is?

How? I really don't think you understand the concept of money. A currency that appreciates a lot is not a good thing. You want to be able to buy a loaf of bread with around the same amount of money year to year. With Bitcoin right now, a loaf of bread would have been $2 last year $10 this year and who knows what next year. That's not a good thing.

Doing better than crypto.

USD is not meant to appreciate lmao. And the fact that Bitcoin is so volatile is not exactly a great selling point.

Yeah crypto is so safe and secure. No one has ever been scammed or lost their money using crypto!

At least with banks you're insured. That's kind of a big thing...dontcha think?
When people can't even leave their coins in exchanges, people should stop acting like crypto is where near as secure and safe as cash in the bank.

This is cute but if people actually bought Bitcoin because of that, there would be like 1000 people total that own Bitcoin and it would be worth $100. Vast majority of people bought into Bitcoin to make money.

Lol wait...so money loses value when it sits in a bank but Bitcoin...the thing that's went from being worth 14,000 to 6,000 in a few months doesn't? Lmfao

Sounds like you read the crypto for dummies book and bought every propaganda line hook line and sinker ��. What makes crypto any more real? If I lose my password tomorrow, what makes the crypto I have mine? What insures me if someone hacks an exchange or a wallet?
