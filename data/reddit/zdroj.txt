T-Mobile is doing something that may help you out. It's not my cup of tea, but others may like it.

It looks like that is what this business is attempting to do. They are providing a service to setup their customers with Bitcoin. 
Not sure what you are getting at.

Is there even an article? If there is, it went over my head.

It's more of a catchy name for their business than an attempt to have something remotely structured on government.
FYI Embassy Suite hotels are also not affiliated with government entities.

Correct, if they were not competitive we would not have McDonalds employees.

I think he owes his team an apology for drawing attention from their feat to his poor choice of shirt. You would think that, knowing he would be on air for a major scientific feat, he would have chosen some more appropriate attire. 
It's like if Armstrong's first words would have been "this is fucking cool"

Here is a scenario. I eat at this restaurant and receive a bill. I am now in debt to the restaurant. I bust out my wad of cash and want to pay. They say no. I walk out. Cops get called. I tell cops I wanted to settle my debt using legal tender. 
Do I get in trouble? I don't think so. Seems like the refusal could happen before the debt occurs. Such as Apple not selling an iPhone. You first need to pay them. I understand that once you owe money, you can settle it with cash. If the person refuses they should forfeit their claim.

do you expect free Bitcoin ATMs and services? I'm not understanding your idea of implementation.
What is the problem with bitcoin consulting business? That is how the world works on a greater scale. Its business, ideas, and expertise. I don't see anything wrong with a business approaching a consulting firm in order to increase their chances of successful bitcoin implementation.

That's stupid when something like 70% of transactions are cash. 
This would make sense in the US though. The only time I use cash is when going out to bars.

MorXpe translated more or less correctly. Koparka is a digging machine such as a back hoe. Translating miner to polish wouldn't really fit as well as using koparka.

None of what you said contradicts my post. I merely mentioned that, knowing he would be televised, and portrayed as the hero of this important endeavor he could have made an exception. I could care less what he wore, but other people had some problems and the media made it a story that turns into what he wore vs what his team accomplished.

Since when is Snowden an authority on these matters. I keep reading these Snowden says posts. He's a young guy who leaked a lot of information way above his comprehension.

I think it's pure marketing here. In Poland, bank transfer is very popular and free. I don't think there are any fees for either party to just do a simple bank transfer.
So a pole logs into their bank account and sends money to their T-Mo account. That's how my grandparents pay their bills. Before this system, one had to go to the post office.

"uh"  doesn't make the Polish "y"  sound you are after. It's more the sound that you make when saying "mitigate"  in the m-it portion. 
Sorry, I'm no pro in this.

Thanks, I would expect very few people in Poland use cc for this type of transaction, and if they did, charge back wouldn't be common. Bank transfer is the defacto way to go there.

I was speaking more of moral grounds than legal. The pirate community might see this as breaking the rules of fair play. If the community believes it has a right to share data regardless of copyright, they may loose that point if someone has potential to profit on it. 
I posted this here to get more feedback from other users. I'm not sure if these tips would be acceptable by the pirate community.

The Kiosk idea is actually a very good one. Packages can also be mailed to/from the Kiosk to break the trail. There is no way you can compete with couriers such as UPS, USPS, FedEX ect. An easier way to do it is to use these services, but bounce the package around your network of physical locations. The user can request to pickup at local Kiosk or have the package shipped to their home.

Yes it is. Possibly made more popular by the TV show

In this case I was suggesting tips or donations to the uploader, and not a mandatory payment. 
Did you pay someone to create a torrent for you and seed it or just for a link to a torrent you couldn't find?

If it takes off, I guess it would show the studios and content producers that people are willing to pay a reasonable price for convenient access to content. 
In my case, I would have to purchase a cable subscription + premium channel package in order to have access to F1. I can't go to Formula1.com and pay per view. It's an outdated business model. Same with shows such as Game of Thrones. There is no access. 
People now have access to HiFi equipment that can put a movie theater to shame, yet there is no way to get a new release to your home theater....

It's really just venting and not so much complaining. I don't know what the reason behind my cancelled transaction was. All it's been a few days of waiting and I don't have my coins. Now I will need to wait another few days as even if I go somewhere else it will be a while before verification.

They could be using bitcoins for fast and cheap transfers. Not as long term investment
