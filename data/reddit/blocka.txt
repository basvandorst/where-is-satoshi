It wouldnt be a CES union, it would be the Las Vegas local stagehand union that would set up most of the stuff.

Yes, my truck was stolen earlier that semister and I had no way to class on two of those days, one day I came in maybe 15 mins late and he marked me as absent. Same teacher I was helping out all semester with Windows 7. He said he was a Novell Engineer but had no Windows experience. They should of been reasonable and I would of stayed and graduated. I had police reports of the truck being stolen and all that. No compassion, no exception and unreasonable. I started selling drugs and probably make way more then I ever could in IT.

So was my teacher at ITT tech. Whom by the way had no experience with any version of Windows, let alone Windows 7 which was the current one we were using at the time. It was so bad that since I was the only person in the whole class that knew anything about computer networking I would literally be teaching and showing everyone on the projection screen, on how to do exercises.
Granted I was the first class at that Campus in MD. Maybe they are doing a little better theses days. But after 2 semesters and not learning anything, they recorded me as absent even though I was like 20 mins late. That absence made me automatically fail and I would have to retake all the classes that I just took/taught and be charged for it again. 
I could not afford to continue and realized that for profit schools like ITT business models are based on taking as much as they can from you. It has completely crushed my dreams of ever working in IT and best I can do its start trying to get certs. But certs are expensive tests, change all the time, and most companies want you to have several certs on entry level jobs. So without social networks, like friends in the field it is hard to get into IT.
TLDR; Nothing really except all my professional dreams crushed

I do not really follow. I just know, I should not have to pay another $12,000 to repeat a semester from a school that I was pretty sure was ripping people off. Turns out they are.

Isent that one of the perks is you can not really ban it because noone, and everyone controls it?
