You can e.g. make a 2-of-2 wallet. That means you need two signatures to send any funds. E.g. you can have copay on your PC and on your phone, and when you pay something on your PC you have to confirm the payment on your phone as well. This is very secure, since when your PC is hacked nobody can do anything with the wallet unless they hack your phone too.
@_date: 2016-08-27 07:47:28
I've switched to using a 2 of 2 multisignature wallet where the two keys are always on different computers. E.g. one computer has one part, and my phone has the other part. That to me feels more secure than having a single heavily secured computer.

I don't think so. Currently most people make bitcoin transactions for trading in exchanges. Exchanges have some incentive for expensive transactions so people keep their coins on the exchange. But if you are a shop who wants to support bitcoin to have a new revenue stream, your incentive is to have very cheap transactions so people actually use it. That's why more and more shops will start to use it. I am pretty sure LN usage will go up exponentially once it starts to get stable. Unfortunately exchanges will be the last ones to support it.

The same way as you rely on network routers to relay your TCP packages. If one route doesn't work, another one is tried. The nodes along the way don't know who's transaction they are routing, what's the final target is, or what's the content of the transaction is, thanks to the onion routing. Did you even read anything about how LN works? There are plenty of good resources available.

Coinmarketcap claims to use the "circulating supply" for market cap calculation. So in your example the market cap would be 1$. I have no idea though how they get to the circulating supply number or if it is in any way accurate.
E.g. SolarCoin market cap based on total supply would be on rank  but based on circulating supply it's just rank

Why would you need a web service? My idea was this:
1. Make the two-page encoding/decoding table public. These are just the Bip39 words, plus their index as a binary pattern. This is public knowledge and does not need to be secret.
2. Print the cold-store pattern
3. When backing up a phrase, you use the printed table to to convert the words into binary pattern. Use the binary pattern. Mark the 1s in the printed cold store pattern with an x.
4. Now fix the printed pattern onto a robust chunk of metal.
5. Use metal drill to put holes wherever you have made an x.
6. Enjoy your extremely robust nearly indestructible metal cold storage.
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:54:54
Sure, it works both ways. Say you want to get the binary representation of "cargo". Look the word up (it's alphabetically sorted), write down the text to the left of the row followed by the column. You'll get `..c...g` `.i.k`. replace letters with 1 and `.` with 0 you get 00100010101 which is your 11 bit binary number.
To get the word from an 11 bit binary, you do that backwards. E.g. 11011101101 replace 1 with letters 0 with dots: `ab.def.hi.k`. look up the first 7 letters for the row `ab.def.`, then choose column `hi.k` and you'll get the word *tank*.

For a similar project a while ago I've created this BIP39 wordlist, to help encode words into binary and back: 
It can be printed on one page (front and back), and with it you can easily transfer any Bip39 word into binary representation.

This is a little analysis of the UTXO graph that [I generated recently](
Watch the video, it's awesome! 
 What you are seeing
X axis shows time when an output was created. The y axis shows the amount of bitcoin stored in the output (see the bar at the right). The brighter the colour the more outputs are at this pixel. When an output is spent, it's associated pixel will get a bit darker or will disappear completely if no bitcoins are at this pixel any more.
Every frame shows this way the utxo set out 30 blocks, starting from the genesis block. That's why at the beginning you only see a line at 50 bitcoin, the initial unspent coinbase reward. I'd call this the"Satoshi Linie"
 First Analysis
I've marked some sections in the graph that I find interesting:
1. I call this the "Satoshi Line". This area lots and lots money at the initial block reward, 50 Bitcoin. These Bitcoins are supposedly lost forever. Interestingly, the line starts to get thinner around time Satoshi became invisible. He has sent his last email in April 2011.
1. These transactions are most likely from bitcoin fountains. They started around June 2011 and stopped September 2011. They are lots of low value transactions from 1 to 45 Satshi. There are no values between the lines, because that's not possible: There's no way to transact half a satoshi on the blockchain. The faucet hype was gone shortly after but the money remains and probably will forever as getting it is not worth it.
3. This strange pattern(s) range from around July 2012 to June 2013. I have honestly no idea whatsoever what this could be.
4. In December 2013 a regular pattern started to appear: about every 7-8 days loads of transactions occured at once. This regularity clearly indicates that the transactions are coming from one entity. Could it be mining pool payouts?
5. The choppy pattern you see here is mostly from consolidations. There used to be more transactions here, but for some whoever had the transaction there decided that transactions are now cheap enough to consolidate them. Sometimes these transactions appear from top to bottom (consolidate most valuable transactions first), sometimes from left to right (oldest first), and I have only very rarelly seen bottom to top. See the video to get a better look for this!
6. Around December 2017 we had the all time high so far. This is still visible as a slight shimmer. When watching the video you can see a large bright yellow spot, but it dissappears soon afterwards as people seem to consolidate their coins.
There are many more patterns hidden in this graph, let alone in the video. What do you see? Can you find something interesting?

It's 11 bits, not 12. So you save a few bits. But you also have to somehow encode at which end to start decoding, e.g. with a different dentstyle.

I wanted to do that at first, but I thought it is more safe to use letters instead because this is a bit less error prone. That way you can just count from a to k.

If the probability of both events (reaching 2000, falling to 200) can be considered equal, the optimal amount of BTC that Kane Kalas should buy can be easily calculated:
    BTC = 2*price / (high - low)
The profit he will make in both cases is:
    profit = BTC * (high - current) - price
In this case, Kane should buy 1.11111111 BTC and with a current price of $450 he will earn $722.2 in both cases.
--- 
Step by step, in this case it is
    BTC = 2 * $1000 / ($2000 - $200) which is roughly 1.1111111 BTC.
With the current price, Kane invests 1.1111111 * $450 upfront, which is $500.
If price goes up to $2000, his BTC are worth $2222.2 so he made a profit of $1722.2. He has to pay $1000, which leaves him with $722.2 profit.
If price goes down to $200, his BTC are worth $222.2 so he made a loss of $277.7. He gets $1000 for that, which again leaves him with $722.2 profit.

I simply can't understand why anyone can think how 100% certainty of having 50 BTC (i.e. not betting) is somehow worse than a 50% chance of having 100 BTC. Even when you would not have to pay any fees, this is a much worse deal because it just increases your risk. When there is even a little fee, in the end you will always lose everything.

bit shifting would only work if he had started with a multiple of 2 of a satoshi. E.g. he could have started with a 85,89934592 BTC reward, and you can perfectly half this every time until you reach 1 satoshi, without the need for truncating or floating point if you calculate in satoshi.

As a side note, the pattern calculates SHA256 of the full public key multiple times and each time it extracts the first 4 bytes as a parameter value. This means if you have two public keys where the first few characters are equal, you will still get a completely different pattern.
This way it should also be pretty much impossible to generate a different public key with the exact same pattern.

Before you do anything, backup it. Copy the application with the wallet onto an USB stick, or better yet store it in an 7z archive with a good password that only you remember and store it e.g. in your online mail account or dropbox.
**only after that backup** you should try to open it / repair it / modify it / whatever.
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:40:24
Well, the disadvantage of this method is that if you take it to the extreme (lower block reward after each block) with e.g. this:
BlockReward = BlockReward - (BlockReward&gt;&gt;18);
you have to loop through this calculation to find out the n-th block reward to recalculate the truncation errors. Also once BlockReward&gt;&gt;18 gets to 0 the blockreward won't decrease any more.

Here is an investment advise: Never invest any money into something risky like Bitcoin that you are not prepared to lose. If losing all your bitcoin money would costs you more than a shrug, don't invest it. I've personally invested about 10% of the money that I don't need in the forseeable future in Bitcoin. If Bitcoin blows up tomorrow, it would cost me a shrug and a raised eyebrow.

Immediately switch off your PC. Take out the hard disk and put 3 holes in it with a steel drill. Then put your PC and hard disk somewhere outside, and cover it in Thermite. Put a stick of Magnesium on it and light it. Once the PC has melted down completely, shred the remains to pieces not larger than 1mm^3. Put everything into a strong container, fill with cement, and burry it in the deepest mine you can find, preferably near some highly radioactive material.

All the information is still exactly the same if you use compression with a PNG file, regardless if you use compression or not. It's like using Zip to compress a file, only that the browser or whatever tool you use automatically does the decompression for you. It's always better to compress a PNG than not to do this.
This is completely different from JPG, which is always lossy.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:55:36
Exactly what PikoStarsider says. An uncompressed key needs two large numbers, the x and y coordinate of point. Since there are only two possible points for any given x on the elliptic curve, when you store the compressed form you just have to store the x coordinate and an which of the two points you mean.

You can calculate a fair bet if you assume e.g. that reaching high or low both have a 50% chance. Then you just need to choose a lower limit and calculate the upper limit from that. 
The optimal number of BTC to buy is (see [here](
    BTC = 2*price / (high - low)
Then the profit will be is equal regardless if high or low is reached:
    profit = BTC * (high - current) - price
To make the bet fair, profit has to be 0 in an optimal bet. Then you can simplify and solve the above two formulas, and get a formula for fair high/low values:
    high = 2*current - low
Example: At a current price of $450, if you choose a lower limit of e.g. $200, the high has to be $700 to be fair. So a safe bet would be:


With this bet, if Kane buys 4 BTC and it reaches 200, he has lost 4 * $450 - 4*200 = $1000 but will get that from the other guy so his profit is $0 again.
If he buys 4 BTC and it reaches $700, he has earned 4*($700-$450) = $1000 but has to pay that to the other guy leaving him with $0.

* $10 in BTC (0.016736 BTC)

* Hand placing relevant amazon links (all books I own myself) is top. I think beeing honest with the readers helps too, I even have a disclaimer that I'll get about 4% if they buy through the links.
* People donate if you tell them that their donation keeps the site alive. I was actually really surprised by how many people donate.

Here is an article: 
As far as I understand, the attacker needs to create a compromised ECDSA implementation that has to be used by bitcoin.

tl;dr: only use a Bitcoin app where you trust the implementation of ECDSA.

I think it is good to minimize errors. If you do major refactoring to the internals, it is a good idea not to introduce new behaviour at the same time. Because if the refactoring breaks something, it is possible to simply revert the changes or to go back to an older release. Keeping the same behaviour also simplifies testing, then you can more easily compare against the previous version.
On the other hand if you want to do a fork it is best to keep the changes as small as possible so that the chances to introduce a bug are minimal, and it is easier to review the changes.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:34:32
I don't know how they handle it, I'm only saying that it is good practice to not mix refactoring with feature updates, and this could be a reason why they don't introduce softforks with any major version.

You have to take a compromise between security and ease of access. There are lots of factors you have to take into account, like:
* Lighting strikes and fries your computer
* Your computer is hacked
* You are robed
* You forget your password
* You die; do you want your relatives to have access to your money?
* your house burns down
Etc. Etc. Taking these and more factors into account, I store my money in a 2of2 multisignature wallet using copay. My spouse and me have one part of the key. When I want to transmit something, she has to confirm. I store a tested backup of the paper wallet in a fire proof and water proof safe, in addition to detailed instructions how my relatives could get to the money if something happens to me. I have the keys to this safe on me.
I believe this is a pretty safe setup. It's very important to consider the real risks, e.g. it is relatively likely that a lightning strike fries all your electronics, or that a pipe breaks and floods your apartment. Also it is extremely important that a backup is tested to work: when I create a wallet I create the backup, then I delete the wallet, and then I use the backup to restore it again.

I live in Europe, and here using affiliates like Google and Amazon.com is a pain. Google requires to have a bank account in the country where I live in, so I have to pay for an extra account that only use for Google. Amazon.com can only pay per check which is extremely uncommon here, I can only get the money in my home bank branch which is 150 km away from where I live now.

Don't we have the same problem just with the fluctuations in mining fee? Say a block has an average fee of 1 BTC. Then miners will increase hash rate until their costs for one block is slightly below 1 BTC, say 0.95 BTC. But that means that whenever the fee for a block would be substantially below the average, it's but profitable to mine. So what I'm trying to say is this: isnt there always a profitability limit that's problematic, regardless how full the mempool is? It seems to me an empty mempool is as bad as a mempool filled with just cheap transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:29:10
As far as I know you don't need any ordering information because the transactions are ordered by their hash value

Good estimate. I did the math. According to google, mini-me is 81cm tall, and gozilla (the original) is 50m tall. To scale that between 1 and 10, you get this formula (size in m):
scale = 0.1829640170766416 * size + 0.8517991461679203
If you are e.g. 170cm tall, this gets you a 1.16 on the scale from 1 to 10.

I believe the value is much higher: bitcoin is part of a completely new asset class. Money will flow in from everywhere just because of that. Bitcoin is extremely restricted by total number of coins, so when money flows in the price has to go up because the number of coins do not increase. Actually it decreases: lots of bitcoins are forgotten and lost forever. I try very hard to keep my coins save, but most people don't.

I'm not a big blocker, I think the restriction is good to stay censorship resistant and decentralized, I was not so sure if it helps to incentivise miners. But I think I get it now. When there is a non empty mempool and fees are not high enough hashrate just decreases a bit and and the system keeps running. Whereas when the pool is empty it does not matter how low the difficulty gets, there is no incentive for anyone to mine.

Well it's a good background to have. As far as I know, LN uses a gossip protocol specified in [bolt 7]( to get information about channels and nodes, then does all the routing based on this information, then send all the routing information in an onion encrypted package on its way. ([Bolt 4]( 
That routing does not sound too difficult to me. It's just a matter of finding *one* possible route, not necessarily the best route. With a few heuristics from node data mentioned in the blog post it does not sound like rocket science to find a working path with relatively high reliability.

deflation is not really a problem, especially since verybody knows it is happening. Take smartphones for example, the prices are deflating now extremely fast so it would be unwise to buy one.

That's not happening, people still buy them more then ever because they want stuff now.

I think it's better to use a 2of2 multisignature wallet. Much more useful than a single private key.

Yes, but anyone can compete to create a lightning node. Everyone is equal with the same chance as everyone else. For Blockchain, not quite so. Just look at that topology; if you want to get in a block you are going to go through that big single Blockchain in the middle there, the Goldman Sachs Blockchain... Good luck decentralizing that.
PS: of course what I am saying is complete nonsense. But than your arguments are equally nonsensical. A lightning node has nothing to do with a bank, as much as a single blockchain has anything to do with a bank. that's pure anti LN marketing.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:10:49
To avoid ambiguity, we should call it 'Bitcoin Cache', as lightning basically caches bitcoin transactions before they are stored in the Blockchain.

Ah, you are right. If the number of buyers *increases* this can lead to a higher price. If all other things are constant, the increase of buyers leads to a higher price.

Isn't that obvious? Practically all miners are now enforcing BIP91. That means for the sake of a stable network it is good when user nodes use the same enforcement logic. With UASF it was the other way round: a minority of users ran UASF nodes, so the probability of disruption would have been higher if bitcoin core supported UASF. In short: bitcoin core's main concern is to protect the stability of bitcoin, not politics. I hope it stays that way.

investing in bitcoin is very high risk. It could crash back to e.g. 0.1 USD/BTC any time if something bad happens. I say only invest your 2500$ if you don't mind seeing it all gone. If a loss of this money would cause you more than raised eyebrows and a shrug, don't invest it bitcoins. Also, plan ahead what you would do if it crashes down, what you would do if it goes up like crazy, or when it does not move at all. Before the investment you are more emotionally detached and can think everything through, once you are invested your emotions might take over and you might make stupid decisions. It's good to know in advance when you do what, and for what reasons.
I invested at a price of 17€ in 2011, and didn't mind at all when it crashed to 2€ shortly after that. It was a risk I was willing to take. I got lucky though since now the price is around 180€.

I use KeePass2 for all my passwords and to store my wallet. The only thing I need to remember is the password to dropbox, and the password to KeePass (which is quite long).

@_date: 2013-12-02 13:30:21
And that is why *everybody* should use a password tool like [KeePass]( and use a different generated password for each and every account. This has saved my ass several times already.
KeePass stores its data in a single file, encrypted with AES/Rijndael (256-Bit Key), and defaults to a number of key transformation rounds so that decryption takes one second, making brute force attacks unfeasible.
Combined with [chromeIPass]( and stored on dropbox this is also quite convenient and still very secure. An [Android app]( is available as well.

a few days ago brainwallet.org has switched to using compressed addresses as a default. The private key calculation algorithm has not changed, so if you can not import the private key fails something in your local wallet/blockchain is probably corrupt.

Why should that be a joke? Is he wrong in thinking that lower fees would be good?
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:22:14
right, I am using this block parser: 
I have modified it so it prints all addresses that have any amount, and added print last transaction date as well in a format that can be parsed with gnuplot. This creates a 190MB text file with 1860761 addresses.
The gnuplot parses the data, and plots a tiny almost transparent red circle. Since lots of circles are drawn, when they overlap it will become dark red.

I lost about 2.5 coins through ~~day trading~~ gambling while everything was fluctuating like crazy. I still have 27 coins and plan to buy some more as soon as my bank transfer gets through. 
The same thing happend 2011. I bought coins for 17€, and it fell down to 2€ but now is around 70€ or so. Still an excellent investment! This time I buy after the crash and hope/speculate that the same pattern unfolds: long time low, then quickening rise to the next bubble in a year or two.

unfortunately not because that would make it a lot more complicated. It would need openssl ruby bindings to calculate, and that's probably difficult to install in windows.

Maybe he has a large amount of bitcoins stored in dust addresses and now can't spend them. That's the only rational explanation I can think of for his strange behaviour.

You should slap yourself for not backing up and not testing a backup, then cry yourself to sleep. The next day, you tattoo "I will always backup my wallet" on your chest.
On a serious note, how come you don't have a backup? Don't all wallets ask to make sure you have one?

It's the insecurities I *don't* know about that make me fear having an encrypted wallet lying around.

Actually much simpler, I have just used znort's blockparser to generate a list of all addresses with their amount. I have changed the output a bit to print unix timestamp. This list is a text file, each line an entry with amount, address, timestamp. I then use gnuplot to load the file and generate a graph from it.

I have created huge graphs with the same data, resolution 12800x7680. Imgur scales them down automatically, so I have uploaded them at my own homepage:

* [12800x7680 Bitcon Balance over Time of Last Transaction](

I too ordered about a day or two before they doubled the price, and got my two 30GH/s end of November as well. They've been constantly mining since then at an average of 64 GH on eclipsemc. The only complaint I have is that they are quite noisy and produce 360 Watt of heat, but since it's winter I'm fine with that. They won't be profitable until summer anways.

You can: install Ubuntu and use it as a server for your Asic miners. At least that's what I am doing.

I personally don't use brainwallets, but when securty is important I use a sentence as a password with vocabulary that is connected to me personally, e.g. through hobbies or places I have been to. Some examples:
* Ikkyo and tenkan, Aikido is fun :)
* Mt. Großglockner in 60 minutes. GO!
* It's sunny. Need moar stracciatella icecream!

I've ordered 2x30 GHash, and got them on 5th November. I've been constantly mining since then at 65 GHash without any problem. They get hot though, the sensor reports 81 degrees. So far I got 1.9 bitcoin which is break even right now. I expect to make a bit of a profit until march/april until the difficulty should be too high. It's not much of a profit though, it would have been much better to just buy bitcoins instead of the miners.
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:02:50
Sure it was a gamble. But I already had a gamble going with the bitcoin price, since I already owned bitcoins. By bying the mining machine I've gambled that the bitcoin difficulty would not increase that fast. I lost that gamble, but at least I did not make a loss. In hindsight it would of course have been more profitable to just invest in bitcoins, but in hindsight I also know what lottery numbers I should have picked so that's kinda useless.

a graph would be cool, that would be an interesting challenge. It would be a graph with 1.3 million nodes (the addresses), and 15 million edges (the transactions).

I have simultaneously added bitcoin donation and paypal donations on my website. So far I have received about 5 donations totaling about $150 through paypal, and one bitcoin donation worth about $1.5. If that is reflective of the average penetration level of bitcoin, it still has got a very long way to go.

Actually only the public key and not the private key is used to generate the pattern, but you need the private key for the QR code of the paper wallet.
It should be impossible to generate the private key from the pattern, because only the public key is used. It should even be impossible to deduce the public key from the pattern, because I process the public key multiple times with SHA256 to extract pattern parameters.

With a 10 fold increase on average every 10 months, in 10 years one bitcoin will be at $ 1.000.000.000.000.000 or 1 quatrillion, or about a half of the estimated total economic production of the human race.

Electrum, because I can write down the password to get access to all my keys and don't need to worry about generated addresses that might get lost.
Also, it is much faster and more convenient than Armory.

Actually I'm already break-even with the current bitcoin price, including electricity cost. The problem is that in march or april the difficulty will be so high that mining is pretty much useless.
