As far as I understand, the facts are presented clearly. Maybe Blockstream being the new banksters are opinion only, but from what I recall AXA holdings who funded blockstream are deeply involved in finance and banking system.

You wrote a really nice reply that I would love to answer properly, but I am dead tired. Let me put it simply,. 
Its this simple, he has bitcoins, he is willing to pay us in bitcoins, or fiat upon conversion.. He offered to pay in bitcoins, parents are somewhat interested just for the reality of using bitcoins for something.


It was for the backstory.


I am not my parents. I am poor, they are less poor than me. Our assets are not intertwined. :P

The rent is not being paid in bitcoins, its being paid in equivalent bitcoins for USD and transferred overseas via bitcoin transfer because thats what he has at this particular moment. And then depending on their need, instantly converted to FIAT or letting it ride on the bitcoin wave.
No worries about that.
This was not a discussion about when it is ok to take bitcoin vs fiat. 
But thanks everyone for their concern.

@_date: 2014-03-31 12:42:24
You are correct. But there are more &amp; higher fees involved with using a bank, possible risk vs reward for holding on to the BTC, additionally, converting first by the renter would have to claim the BTC as income for themselves.
Not arguing with you. There are negs and positives for both.

does not equal Bitcoin.
There are many sources of Bitcoin information, and being deluged with news from unfortunate souls who lost their ass due to that clown, reposting the same information does not make me read and retain it. It does/did not apply to me. I only retained what was relevant. Don't use Mt. Gox, do research and ask here for recommendations for exchanges. Which is what I did.

Evangelist, theoretical/pseudo investor and at one point, a miner. Electricity costs and not having money for equipment put an end to that quite quickly. (Not US based anymore.) Back when it was economical to mine with basic pc equipment, I didn't see the point. I missed the mining boat so to speak... my first bitcoins which I mined years ago I lost them during many pc formats since then. I did the same mistake with mp3's when they first came out. I had cds, I didn't see the point then either. :D
Live and learn.
I currently am the proud owner of .00008 bitcoins which I can't extract from my mining pool til it reaches some usable level. But I believe in Bitcoin, or the whole crypto currency idea. More So than physical currency even.

As I said, I have glossed over the details, such as I am aware of the giant Mt. Gox fiasco, but as far as the name of the CEO I hadn't engrained it to my memory. I'm sure if I had lost some of my shiny bitcoins to his crooked organization I would know his name as well. Now go away.

While you are right, the article was speaking about distributing child private keys (not child public keys) along with master public keys, it does state  with the master public key and a child private key the master private key can be derived.
"And tada, we get the master private key back. Now, we can go ahead and pilfer all of the other addresses in the wallet, even those which the wallet’s owner never intended to touch. "
Thanks :)

what you are asking for is the reason why exchanges exist in the first place. Coinbase itself is not really useful in this case because every time you cash out to Fiat you will be taxed. what you need to do is use an exchange where the transfer to cash is not actually put into your bank account either using gdax where they keep your u.s. dollars in coin base and don't deposit it in your bank account or another exchange where they use USDt tether to keep your value in US Dollars on their Exchange.

They can only track BTC if you go through KYC/AML channels (Exchanges who cooperate can report cross alt-coin linkages), or stay on the BTC chain. 
If you convert BTC to a private coin, like Monero, the BTC transaction linkage ends there and a person could repurchase BTC again at a later time and place. Just FYI 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:10:35
Basic math but its based on percentage of growth. For example if you buy 400 of bitcoin while it costs 4000. And then the price goes to 5000 you would then have 500. If btc price goes up x percent so would you investment

Buying before the next fork ensures that you have coins on both. 
What you do with the forked coins is more important than when you buy them.
BTC dropped today for 53XX today shortly.. which may be its lowest for the next month. We shall see. :)

That is a bit disingenuous, that has been happening periodically for quite a while, long before Bitcoin Cash existed.


@_date: 2017-10-30 06:00:28
The short liquidating a.k.a the person shorting had to buy back 7000 BTC is what caused the jump. Not the other way around. They were probably shorting since 5300 or so in one of the last waves.

I think you are missing a bit of what I am saying.
If you convert BTC to any alt-coin on a KYC/AML exchange, they could record and transmit this conversion to the IRS. How many BTC converted to how many alts. The IRS could then audit the alt-coin blockchain and track your coins.
If you convert BTC to Monero on a KYC/AML exchange, they could record and transmit this conversion to the IRS. They could report how many BTC you converted to Monero. Just like any other altcoin conversion on a KYC/AML.
Heres the difference.
But if you convert your BTC to Monero on a non KYC/AML exchange, there will not even be a source for any correlation to see how many Moneros have been purchased with the BTC. And technically, the trail of transactions ends there.
But with Monero, there is zero way to track your coins, or even prove outside of the report from the KYC/AML exchange in where you converted your Monero, how many coins you may have.  See for yourself:   
If you then re-enter the BTC space from Monero, from a non KYC/AML location, the coins purchased with Monero have no identifying source and are therefore "new" bitcoins, with an unknown owner...
I probably didn't explain this well enough but I suggest you read a little bit about really how private monero is.. its badass.

Seeing that fiat is manipulated at every level (print more, add more zeros to accounts, 10x lending vs cash on hand etc.) in my opinion almost useless form to hold value, unlike bitcoin.  
Debt forgiveness for fiat is is basically removal of said zeros, which they will add back / relend out regardless of on hand cash in the end. 
Hey you, remember that imaginary monetary store of value you lent me? Imagine I ain't gonna pay you back, and suck a lemon.
In this case, the traditional system is more flexible than bitcoin. Its easier to forgive something that you can just generate more of.... which is why bitcoin is really a store of value.
