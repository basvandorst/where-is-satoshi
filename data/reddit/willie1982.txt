I am a newbie. Sat the 2017 run out while others jumped on board and after the crash end of 2018 I thought 'this is interesting' and bought in at 3280. Dumb luck is what that is.

On the tablets that moses shattered it did. But then he received new commandments.

Well, the ten commandments don't cover murder or rape either, so why do we need important things for bitcoin?
My favourite would be; do not boil Satoshis in Bitcoin milk.

I have no idea if it is the same here, but banks are obligated to report unusual deposits and the cash 10k figure is an indicator of that. 
At least the banks in Denmark asks about it before reporting you to the equivalent of the IRS.

Patreon banned Lauren Southern last year, Dave didn't care, Patreon banned It's going down, Dave didn't care and even when Milo was banned he didn't even mention it. Milo had a tamper tantrum about it (they can burn in hell he wrote and calling the idw goons). 
And of Dave had any principles he would have left Twitter and Youtube as well.
So yes more people were banned but only the Sargon case made them leave Patreon. And I have the feeling Dave wouldn't have done it if Peterson wasn't in on it.

Member. Sargon. He didn't give a fuck about Milo who was banned the week before.

Thanks you, so it is about control and no middle man, but does basic crowdfunding like Dave wants have any major advantages when using bitcoin. 
Banks are not blocking account  and i would bet that Dave will change his bitcoin for dollars immediately and store it on his bank account.
So i am still not seeing the why Dave would specifically have to choose bitcoin as a patreon substitute.

But can you hear us pumping on your bitcoin?

I know I am missing things, but what is the difference between, hey this is my wallet, please give me bitcoin and this is my bankaccount, please give me money?
Patreon and Subscribestar are making things easier for them to beg for money, befor Patreon, Dave already used PayPal and I think Sam Harris has his own donate button on his website.
And Dave only talks about leaving, his Patreon is still online, like he is always bitching about Youtube, but don't have the balls to leave it and make his own website to air his show.
I loved the video with Jordan, where they both whine about Patreon, say that they will be leaving, but that would cost them money and that they don't care about that, but in the meantime they both still holding on to their precious Patreon money.

He thinks I am like Raskolnikov and that I would murder someone if it is the most rational thing to do and he wrote a christian self help book for incels. 
I really can't understand why someone would like the guy, unless it's the incels moms that don't have to clean up the rooms any more.
But I like Dave, he is cancer, but if he can hold up his beer I think I can enjoy an evening with him, but Jordan will say that it depends what you mean by beer and ruin your evening.

But what to do with my deers?
