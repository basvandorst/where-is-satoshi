This was probably created in reaction to @_date: 2017-12-13 17:10:00
Or maybe that was just a narrative because the people who wanted this the most were obviously those against the current devs. Bullshit reason. If those guys try to make LN do we not make it anymore?

For one, I don't see how those two coins are related in any way (except for both trying to claim the BCC ticker)
For two, those new custom protection laws will apply for every single cryptocurrency, so I don't see them crippling any coin more than the other. You will have the same disclaimers

No one is responsible of Bitcoin. There are no officials in Bitcoin. You can make proposals of soft forks or hard fork. Eventually, the market decides.

So? How does this affect BCH in particular? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:16:35
You can't say there aren't going to be superior technologies to Bitcoin just because it is going to have a second layer
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:58:01
I think regardless of whether we have a LN or not, we desperately need an increase. Even with LN you will still get mad fees when depositing money in channels, this shit is slowing down/blocking bitcoin growth

@_date: 2017-08-12 11:56:24
The difference being that litecoin does *not* share the same blockchain. No bitcoin ever became litecoin. Litecoin did not fork in that way.
The value of the bitcoins from a user who did not touch his assets after August 1^st is now split in two bitcoins.
Yes, the two are different and work with some different parameters. Yes, buying only one supports the idea, the rules of the network.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:00:40
No point? Bitcoin's fees are too high for any small/medium transaction right now. There is a point. Objectively.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:01:29
If 90% decides to mine on an "altcoin", the other coin *is* the altcoin. That's how Bitcoin works - it's decentralized, users take the decision, not a restricted group of devs.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:42:32
Making decisions that turn to yield deficit does not mean the decision was wrong - it may also mean you got unlucky. Trading is not "hodl at any time". You should not regret every single decision that turns out to go bad before thinking whether it was actually the best choice considering what you knew back then.
If I put 5 bullets in a 6 barrel gun, shoot, and get 10$ if I don't die, should I do it? If I refuse to, fire in a bag of sand, and click! I could have won 10$, should I regret not doing it?

Well, some say Bitcoin should be the internet gold and low fees should be the market of altcoins. Not everyone will agree that high fees are a problem. I personally think they are, but some will say they are necessary for security.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:32:37
I never called segwit version an altcoin.
Besides we're free to think, of course. I'm free to correct him however 
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:09:31
Bitcoin and BCH work the same way except one got segwit and the other 8x. There is an equal amount of centralization, big blocks do not introduce any
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:03:21
Everyone has a horse and doesn't really give genuine advice around here. People in would have told you to sell BTC before it got up to 4k+. Same shit

@_date: 2017-08-09 11:54:54
Yes? It just happens to have the same name/ticker, but that's meaningless from a chain point of view.
If I hardfork Bitcoin to BitcoinPenguinOfDOOMZ, keep the whole chain of transactions history, and use it with my friends only, it still *is* a Bitcoin. You can argue it's not the major one, but it's one.
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:19:09
Any holder of Bitcoin before August owns both. Technically, Bitcoin is now the join of both
I don't know, I think people should be happy that holding their assets from July yields them a 4k value bitcoin now

What defines an altcoin? Both originate from Bitcoin. BCH is still young.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:05:13
Right now btc is a bit in a cess pool because of the recent fork, but you should sort by top if you want to figure the reasons why people left here. It's not black and white like people are trying to say
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:05:56
Is FireFox main purpose really to make money?
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:51:29
That's straight up false, BCH is a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:15:05
So you now have 41% - 59%? Or did you not get BCH from the fork?

wat? no? who is stealing peoples bitcoin wtf lol
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:01:45


That's somewhat unrelated? Bitcoin cash didn't fork when Segwit went through, it forked to push 8MB blocks
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:26:36
There's no risk to it? You can easily switch from one to the other with your infrastructure 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:53:35
They don't have fewer transactions? It even topped BTC today I think 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:24:36
If that car becomes the norm, the roads will eventually be made for it
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:39:36


But you don't need SegWit for Lightning...?
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:01:40
Both sides sometimes do that shit, and sometimes play reasonable. Overall I find both subs childish, at least the other one doesn't have biased heavy moderation 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:23:43

@_date: 2017-08-09 10:07:38
I think SegWit is okay, but it's simply not enough to lower fees and transaction times and make that one bitcoin supermarket in Philippines or China or whatever viable.
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:21:41
You can't predict it. You want to buy currencies when they're at the lowest, but you never know when you reach that lowest.
Maybe you buy now and it gets -5% lower before going up, and regret it.
Maybe you wait for it to go down more, and it gets +5% higher before you decide to buy, and regret it.
It's all gambling
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:53:18
It's great! Less circlerjerky too
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:09:42
NYA was for S2X, not Segwit

@_date: 2017-08-27 00:08:52
How so? Congestion hurts Bitcoin more right now, with so many tx
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:02:22
Yes? If you had 1BTC before August, and held, you have 4k worth now :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:49:21
I'm saying that any alive fork of bitcoin done in a way that all holders of the current chain get an asset on should be considered Bitcoin, yes.
If I fork BTC tomorrow and create a LOLBTC coin with 1GB blocks, giving a LOLBTC asset to everyone with BTC, sharing the blockchain; it is a part of Bitcoin as long as it still has any value.
You can claim a bigger part of the market is using BTC, that 90% of the consensus is there, but for now there are two alive bitcoins - although you can support and trade on only one of two as you please.
Edit: after a hard fork, there is no tell which is bitcoin and which is the "fork" (tickers are arbitrary). We could have this problem with Segwit2x too
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:06:02
Why was his post deleted?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:01:45
So basically, they say we don't need a fork because there is BCC? Interesting, but I don't see miners switching so easily without a trigger 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:00:45
You can trade it just like any other coin when Coinbase allows it. It's currently in the low $300s, that is, 8% of a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:58:19
The hard fork is still recent but I'm still hoping refocuses a bit on BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:18:04
You can't ever know how well a crypto will do, with all the research in the world. The risk is *never* negligible, too many unpredictable factors
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:09:17
Even though it will naturally adjust, BCH is soon going to be more profitable to mine than BTC
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:49:31
He could also have lost everything. Not necessarily the smartest idea even though that turned out well
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:52:30


Kind of but not exactly, it's the size of the block (which is correlated but not proportional to the transaction count).


@_date: 2017-08-21 23:34:20
That's right. NYA=S2X=Segwit2x in bitcoin. According to the agreement, 2x should go through with no more vote than Segwit  
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:14:32
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:08:36
But because of the adjustment techniques, it will become profitable to mine.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:05:43
BCC is used on some exchanges for Cash, like some use XBT for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:27:24
Both sides call the other attackers. The point you stand on always looks like a home you defend
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:04:09
That's because on-chain tx are low right now 
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:02:30
Eh, I guess it makes sense for exchanges that don't support BitConnect to use the BCC ticker.
So I don't think there is any "correct" one, both exist, just like BTC/XBT and so many others.
I'd argue the same goes about the bitcoin name but we probably won't agree on that.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:27:37
What? You can use it for Bitcoin, so it's a bitcoin wallet...
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:25:20
So basically, the growth of Bitcoin must stagnate?? You said it's fine because less users will come in. Shouldn't it be the network adopting to the user count and not the opposite? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:50:59
rbtc is just the shelter for all the banned big blockers. Since BCH is basically bitcoin with big blocks, it's no surprise it's popular there

What did you read?
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:02:31
There are alts that have had the transaction volume of BTC at some points and are still very safe. 1MB doesn't magically warrant any more safety
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:50:32
There is a lot more to grow as a crypto than what it is now. I don't see why it should curve and the growth should slow down.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:58:24
Well, most exchanges/miners are/were, at this point saying NYA signers=attackers is antagonizing 80-90% of the ecosystem.
Fees are pretty variable depending on the size of the transaction, but a 0,2$ fee could only work if you have less than 6 (!!) bytes of transaction since if we consider a 600sat/B fee,
6B \* 600sat/B \* 6000$ / 100000000=0.2$
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:30:55

@_date: 2017-11-13 15:04:59
I thought it was common sense that regardless of what's on the roadmap 1MB is unnecessarily small for a network as large as Bitcoin. It's not like nodes need to run on 10 years old hardware.

You shouldn't be stingy at any time. Sharing a relationship is also accepting he/she will not always agree with your views and your passion, and it isn't about "hey wait till we're 30 and we'll have a ton of money and I stop being a stingy ass that can't pay 40 bucks for a birthday"
If you have that much to invest in bitcoin, you have enough to spend for nice things that your loved one will enjoy (that includes gifting his/her dad if that's so important to him/her)
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:57:46
That's not how it works, at the peak you needed 600sat/Byte to get a transaction to go through, SegWit or not. SegWit may reduce the size of the transaction, that's all. The difference isn't that big.
If it was so easy, don't you think so many exchanges and tools would have implemented it and have a huge advantage over competitors? (coinbase, etc.)
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:38:42

That you still make more money in Venezuela than by clicking in faucets? Absolutely
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:55:57
Lack of replay protection doesn't mean people can steal your coins or that you will lose them. If you know what you're doing, especially with the opt-in replay protection, you will be able to control coins on both chains no problem.
I'm sure there'll be plenty of guides when the time comes
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:30:12
Should mods really be partisan in this fork?
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:29:16
Thanks, so ~17-18 November
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:05:01
Why not both? It doesn't exclude anything. Bitcoin could be good as a currency *and* as a settlement :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:22:01
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:24:30
With the lack of replay protection and so on, it's still undecided. One of the two chain might absorb the other one with overwhelming majority. The reason why replay protection is opt-in in Segwit2x is, as said, that it's attempting to not create a split.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:46:29
The market already accounts for that though, like for every event. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:52:05
Yeah, they're big blockers, so pro-bch
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:06:58
That's hard to find. I go to bitcoin news sites. The other subs and have opposite circlejerks, it helps balance out opinions. Still a cultish circlejerk
can be a nice in between, but still acts retarded from time to time
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:14:17
They're still mining both afaik, with a mechanism to switch to the most profitable coin
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:49:20
The reason they like that coin is because they are big blockers in the first place 
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:13:48
What the hell makes you think the price going down is a buying opportunity 
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:38:54
Yes, because it's meant to be a minority fork. SegWit2x is not meant to be one, that's why it doesn't have EDA or strong replay protection. It's basically "the room is too small for the both of us" mindset being applied there
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:13:50
It will survive with an EDA just like the other fork
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:25:35
With solar boots!
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:42:08


That's like $0.40 cents to make a day. Can you really do that?
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:05:37
Exactly, that's why there has never been decisions based on user opinions, and why forks are based on miner signalling
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:31:26
I think you misunderstood, that's a pejorative way of calling Bitcoin (the original chain).
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:14:42
It's really just as childish as those who call Bitcoin BCore, yeah.
But I think crypto communities have always been quite petty and childish (see all the "fiat is shit" memes)
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:05:10
But those blocks will not be rejected by the NYA miners software? who will not run Core 0.15, I guess
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:03:36


This is straight up misinformed. The Segwit soft fork did not include any block size increase - all that was changed was the support for Segwit tx - only the Segwit2x hard fork will.


I don't like this attitude of denying all counter-arguments altogether. I'm neutral on Segwit, but I recognize there are good arguments for and against.
Anyway, since when are nodes the metric? Blocks have always been afaik. 99% people don't run full nodes
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:09:24
That's not true, the minimum wage in Venezuela is going up a lot and isn't a few bolivars anymore
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:08:48
The nice thing about this sentence is that both parts of the community think their view has been chosen
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:44:39
A hardfork from August 1st: @_date: 2017-09-03 15:12:44
I'm okay with the hype and memes, but everyone is so unrealistically optimistic and say banks are scared and bitcoin will 2x every month and also very biased against alternative narratives
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:34:35
Users. After the hashrate stabilizes as the difficulty adjusts, the price will determine the most profitable chain to mine, which will become the majority chain.
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:48:37
It's just not miners, wallets etc. will be ready for it. I think it's an overlooked part of the Bitcoin ecosystem
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:49:41
Not for opinions tho
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:27:48
Alright, they do, but those blocks will still be relayed by the other 10% of the network? Nodes aren't a choke point as far as I know, mining is, right?
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:45:22
Only those that suggest Bitcoin is not the best and only real crypto
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:48:46
You say users agree to support, but that's completely subjective because there is no way to measure that
Miners can activate forks regardless of whether or not users agree to them. When did I say whether I agree or disagree to the Segwit SF? When did you?
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:38:35
Alright, do you know of any community that takes no side in this fork and has some debate about it? I'm tired of reading one-sided arguments from one side and the other.
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:18:09
Good question. Given the price, I would have said Bitcoin is the "get in crypto because you try to get rich" coin, but I think that's a minority opinion :)
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:50:36


Alright, so it's just semantics at this point. Let's say block size = block weight then. Doesn't change that
""*There were tons of discussions about block size and 2-4 MB was found to be safe, so Segwit SF included a block size increase **too***""
is wrong, right? It says Segwit SF included a block size increase **as well**, which is not true.
That's the point I was arguing.


I don't understand why you keep calling me dishonest so aggressively. Can we not argue normally?...
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:37:26
Of course not, been following bitcoin for almost a month and still not sure 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:43:13
There's always a waiting time for on-chain transactions - even if it's a few minutes, it makes it hard to use it *directly* for real-life shopping and such.
Also, being your own bank brings security problems. If you have 50k$ in a bank, no matter if the bank gets robbed, you are typically not affected. If you keep it home in a hardware wallet (highly recommended), you may get it stolen if someone hears about it, or grow paranoiac about it.
You can also not use it when you need toilet paper.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:46:12
Except any other country that can still ban it, like US
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:43:14
That pic is hilarious
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:49:11
The miners are incentived by the users, but in the end, yes, PoW is how Bitcoin is defined by the whitepaper. Have you heard of any metric in use to decide which soft fork or hard fork to pick?
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:42:32
They are a probability problem, and this obsession of finding the cheapest moment by looking at the past is misguided and disregards probabilities altogether. It's a psychological effect that has no good basis.
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:30:58
Localbitcoins is very anti-Bitcoin Cash, so I don't think they'll propose that service
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:08:39
And all of a sudden the pool hashrate drops/disappears? That would be obvious for large pools
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:39:52
The last character is a question mark, so it should be one
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:49:38
But you don't know *when* the correction is going to be, if it's rising it may as well rise 3 times what it did before getting a correction.
Plus you don't even know if it's really rising *uncontrollably*, most of the time it is not
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:32:11
So you're saying users have a say in whether SF pass or not? What if I disagree with a SF like Segwit? Not using Segwit-enabled software will not do anything about Bitcoin supporting Segwit or not.
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:12:58
Stop presenting opinions as facts. What is a consensus for you? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:43:39
Except if you believe the valuation is still &gt; current price, you should buy **now**, cause there are good chances the price will keep going up. It's the future that matter, not the past.
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:41:22
What defines bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:05:04
I don't believe? Believe in what?

Except any other country that can still ban it, like US
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:55:51
It's at a certain block number, which is now predicted to be in mid-November. We can't know the date for sure if I understand correctly
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:08:28
I don't see so many of them, and no discussion around. I don't see a whole lot of actual debates which is what I am looking for. Any subs you know for pacific discussion? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:27:26
Well you'll get 0.6 coin from both chains
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:12:01
Users? From where? Where do you see opinions of *users*?
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:23:48
Between the OP and which one do you think is the grown up attitude?
@_date: 2017-09-25 09:17:55


lol, memes are great advices now
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:54:48
Yeah but they don't do that daily
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:07:59
36 comments there though. The comments on that thread aren't that different from here actually...
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:39:56
I do not look at the past this way. If I believe there's a good reason to buy and  it's been running up, I won't hesit for a second.
People with this "buy the dipppp" hivemind are just (inconsciously or not) following the "it went down so it has good chances to go up now" reasoning, a well-known probabilistic trap. If you have a casino machine that hits 5 whites in a row, you don't bet black because of that.
This reasoning is full of wishful thinking, trying to be the one that buys the lowest point in a long time. It comes from lack of understandings in probabilities, no less
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:49:30
Why? They're never a good place to buy/sell bitcoin if you know enough to do that stuff by yourself.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:54:29


They are? I keep hearing about that here and then but haven't seen anything.
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:10:35
Sure, but I would stand that what you call "the community" is a minority among Bitcoin investors.
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:58:06
People are saying China ban is good news because that's what they do with most of the bad-looking news: try to deflect it as "actually that's good for bitcoin". That happens in every crypto community.
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:42:45
RemindMe! 60 days
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:26:34


Forks can have consensus, though? Segwit was a SF with consensus, for example
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:01:08




That's not right, because it does not mean I, as a user, have a say about what is in Bitcoin, only what feature I can use.
Let's say I believe a SF introduces security faults or increases fees in Bitcoin. I would like it not to pass, but I am powerless: the miners decide only.


Kinda offtopic, but there are plenty of writeups arguing against Segwit altogether.
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:12:23
Because? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:15:37
Oh, one can only hope for a clugged frontpage when 2x gets no. 2, double the reason for drama! 
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:41:31
Absolutely. Sometimes I go to for the rare gem of a moderate opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:52:29
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:44:56
They will follow the longer chain for the BTC ticker iirc 
@_date: 2017-09-12 09:16:49
0 fee and instant, private transactions tho
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:57:03
Because they want the Bitcoin infrastructure? Same reason why everyone (small blockers, big blockers) wants their vision to be implemented on the main chain and not become the minority fork
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:34:19
Your conspiracy site does not make things fact. Climate always changes, it is normal that it warms up, but now it's warming up a shitton

@_date: 2017-10-04 14:16:28
Yeah, I use that too, but you can't really post about scaling debates or that exchange which opened in that country etc
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:02:18
Because they want to avoid a split on the long term
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:32:08
Only to determine stability, not to pick the Bitcoin chain
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:16:44
They're big blockers, what did you expect? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:30:10
I'm now a sad Android user :]
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:33:17
Yeah I agree, even though the other sub's 0-ban policy got some inconvenients, this one is sadly shaping opinion through bans.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:27:18
Right, let's kill infidels!^^/s
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:49:28
Huh? No one is going to wait for a meeting to attack those guys. If anyone cares that much 
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:16:59
Isn't mining BCH against NYA anyway?
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:07:02
How is it different from Bitcoin??
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:00:46
Stop taking part to the game. Stop taking radical positions and name-calling each other. That'd be a great start.
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:35:26
It's more like the subreddit for big blockers
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:45:12


Well, not quite yet then lol
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:29:45
Of course, it's just an example, you can apply that to anywhere you want to buy reasonably cheap stuff (like, not cars and houses).
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:54:24


The problem is that those "90% of computers running Bitcoin Core" do not represent 90% of the ongoing mining...  Non-mining nodes do not validate blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:45:02
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:02:44
Then yeah, you can reasonably do that. Check the fees with the exchange you will use beforehand though , to make sure 
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:36:53
Why would full blocks be a problem for Litecoin? You just include more transactions in the block, no reason anything suddenly breaks. Bitcoin has had full blocks for an eternity, albeit at a lower frequency. Litecoin has always worked fine and I don't foresee any stability issue
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:52:35
I've found there's, actually, very little beneficial info in both subs. They are both extremely biases and create a lot of noise and very little good discussion.
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:21:24
To help with the backlog?
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:50:31

@_date: 2017-10-06 05:14:52
There is no such thing as bitcoin software, thankfully.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:09:35




It says in the article Coinbases chooses based on difficulty
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:32:18
Definitely, I'd love that...
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:30:12
How do you explain that the communities of other cryptos are more mature/less antagonizing then?
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:34:30
I think it's not the case in practice, the Bitcoin community is obsessed about going to the moon, being "undervalued" such that I don't think 90% of bitcoiners know much or give a crap about the underlying technology. 
The other chain is more unknown and made of big blockers, so people who know enough to at least have an opinion. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:13:22
Isn't he banned here?
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:10:16
Why isn't using the opt-in replay protection sufficient to handle things safely?
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:08:19
Well, the price (and the PoW that follows) decides what Bitcoin is. It's decentralized, no one controls it, that's all the beauty!
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:16:15
and a bit of ignorance of a certain mathematics field?
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:33:24
People moving altcoins to BTC to get coins from the two chains after the fork
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:30:43
I don't know, it's a bit hard to enforce rules, isn't it? It's like "bitcoin sub except you can't say extreme stuff, conspiracy theories, and ad hominems", very subjective and hard to enforce, right
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:14:15
Misinformation? Wat. You are mixing up block weight and block size... The effective block size is still 1MB, but Segwit transactions can represent &gt;1MB of data.
It's still not a block size increase, the 1MB limit is Still hardcoded in Bitcoin code
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:57:25
But LN brings reliance on third parties, it doesn't magically extend Bitcoin. I agree that LN is a solution, but I don't feel like shitting on other coins for allowing coffee transactions, that itself is always a good thing.
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:43:34
I never said I believe Bitcoin is necessarily going to go down now. I said that 


That's sensibly different.
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:43:16
I'll never understand why people think it's nice to have a dip before investing 
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:19:39
S2X will not be an altcoin like BCH, it will not have default replay protection, so it will be a takeover attempt
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:20:27


No backlog now, but it comes here and then and slows down tx/increases fees. Right now things are rather good in average, but we just had a huge spike ( and I guess we can expect more. Of course, Segwit's helping here and there, but it's not like there's no benefit to more tx capacity.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:10:27
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:19:14
Both subs have a lot of propaganda in one way or the other. People insult dissenting opinions, say "fuck off", call others "trolls", "FUD", "paid shills" and it's upvoted. It's very hard to have any proper debate anywhere, I'm desperate for one
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:36:33
Great, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:31:41
Well yeah, if too many blocks on a chain are empty, the mempool will be really bad. That's very bad publicity for the miners though, I doubt 
 they would risk it.
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:23:17
Literally printing money. You aren't any better than the govt!
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:07:54
Both subs are very very circlejerky and upvote straight up dishonest information about the other side. Make your own opinion by listening to everyone.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:16:12
There wouldn't have been any "free cash" anyway, the price of Bitcoin would be split
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:42:46

@_date: 2017-10-07 21:17:03

Miners can boycott a chain for as long as they like, clugging the mempool
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:20:08


Do they? It's a bit hard to imagine they are invested enough in the debate to know and care about to have an opinion on it. My guess would be that they would support whatever intermediary they are using supports.
It's hard to find a list on what support what, they all tend to be very biased with an agenda in one way or the other. I guess that's the problem in general with bitcoin, everyone is so biased as fuck discussions are hard.
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:17:58
They are a shit show because of their EDA, haven't heard of issues due to blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:21:56
Sure, that's irrelevant to my point. This statement is not true:


@_date: 2017-10-07 21:18:04
Mid November 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:23:43
I think Bitcoin communities (compared to other cryptos) in general are pretty immature, but I'm not sure why that is. It feels like they are filled by teens who think they found the secret to be millionaire and defend aggressively their positions.
Or maybe it's just reddit, I don't know.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:06:39
Trade which way? Sorry, which coin will bitpay support?
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:12:18
I mean, how is it different than Bitcoin regarding the "shitcoin means offers no value to the market" part
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:48:25
And it probably had a 90%-ish chance of happening, still
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:24:06
You can send zero output to this address. I think they said the address private key will be public.
@_date: 2017-09-20 09:57:42
Alright, good point
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:29:41
It cannot end in an altcoin without replay protection. S2X is very different from BCH and is not meant to coexist. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:59:46
As long as you have the address, it's always much better than on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:35:51
It's a huge circlejerk, and this community acts very childish against opposing views (small/big blockers)
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:36:47
Because a large part of them are bitter ex-and hating on a common enemy is what gives the better consensus, and thus the most upvotes
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:34:42
If you are confident Bitcoin goes through, then you are confident Xapo will not choose 2x. No reason to scream at them
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:15:31
Afaik, BTC1 has just been a Bitcoin client for a while, they happen to support 2x, I guess that doesn't help with the confusion but well.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:05:47
This sub isn't really any different
@_date: 2017-09-25 09:15:27
4-5% Segwit cannot possibly bring an improvement this large, there are other factors obviously.
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:18:06
Huh? Wasn't that obvious?
@_date: 2017-09-25 09:13:58
Because contrarily to the circlejerk around, nothing warrants Bitcoin is going up, and it is definitely not going to go up indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:39:16
They're not, they're neutral 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:40:45
The exchange fees make your average return definitely negative for 10$. I wouldn't

Calm down, they said they are going to follow the longest chain, that can be Bitcoin.

If you're never selling, you're not trading, you're investing.

I know it's hardly appropriate, but people there aren't insane so...

I think miners actually want Bitcoin to succeed, and that's how they will make the most profit.
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:41:39


Well they think BTC will make them millionaires, so their wealth at least depends on it.
**edit**: omg I was right


Every bitcoin place tends to end up cult-following one way or the other. The two bigs subreddit are done for that, try Rbitcoinmarkets or Rbitcoindicussion

Alright , correct but they can just block the port and it would already be massive disruption

Knowing bitcoin.com stance, they definitely won't, but my question still holds. I'm not sure what are the terms of the NYA.

People say buying them is hard? Haven't seen that.
I guess the hard part is keeping them secure. "Being your own bank" isn't so trivial

You should post on if you're looking for a CMV imo
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:00:58
That's a good point, does s2x start with a different difficulty than the s1x chain?

Everyone can do humor, not so much good humor

Before any fork, you should always keep your coins on a wallet you control. This is the only way to make sure you will get coins from both branches
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:43:57
It's literally what they said. It all depends on what people pay for now :)
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:21:38
Because it's a percentage of the population.

There's always been empty blocks being mined. Actually, there used to be much more. I doubt it's related to the ongoing drama.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:58:15
It could be, but they've explicitly said it wasn't a plan to remove Core, so probably not.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:09:13
uh, shit, did some googling. I didn't think there could be technical limitations on this that are so hard to overcome/centralized. Oh well :(
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:59:01
The fee is half the mBTC? Really?
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:22:13
wtf, I thought bitcoin had minimal fees
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:54:13
Because it was like that when I learned about it.
