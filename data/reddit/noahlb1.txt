Honestly the idea of that t-shirt is to get it as a joke for a friends birthday or something, it's not meant to be taken seriously

I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you're looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money... but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it - I will not look for you, I will not pursue you... but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you... and I will kill you

:) thanks, you too!
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:01:56
ahahah fair enough, are there any that you like?
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:34:30
The link is to a specific shirt on our site, however we have many designs on the site.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:27:39
Yeah that's because the hodl me tight t-shirt was already on sale and an additional 15% off would've squeezed our margins to under a dollar 
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:16:42
ok i've had a look at the menu options, it should all be there now.
