I, personally, am a big fan of P2P exchanges. I feel more in control when it comes to the trading aspect of it. I am also bothered by the current trend of exchanges implementing KYC, but there are alternatives. Paxful (which is also a P2P exchange), for instance, just requires the users to verify their email. I feel like all exchanges are eventually going to implement KYC but while that isn't the case just yet, I'm sticking to better alternatives.
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:11:57
There are also a lot imperfections with bitcoin because technically, all cryptocurrencies are in their infancy stage and still have a lot of maturing to do. It's also new and not many people are educated about it. Other than that, you brought up really good points.
@_date: 2018-05-28 07:08:52
Give Paxful a shot! It's very beginner-friendly and their customer support is great (which, personally, I think is one of the most important things you should be looking for in an exchange). Also, since you're looking for privacy, Paxful hasn't implemented KYC yet so all you have to do is verify your e-mail address.
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:08:35
I would actually really want one. The gold one looks sickkk

@_date: 2018-05-24 03:17:06
I kinda like it! I think I'd probably be a newcoiner as well lol
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:59:50
Bitcoin is the OG crypto, I'll never abandon it
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:08:28
This is great. I hope Rami Malek performs this song in the upcoming movie. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:13:10
I think that it's definitely possible but I think that it's a long shot (for the forseeable future). 
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:05:54
I lost it at "CONEBASE"
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:23:49
Although it may be true that it might be moving away from the direction crypto was intended for, we'll never really know if that could be a good thing or not. One of the reasons most exchanges are implementing KYC is for more security, and although that sounds good on paper, some of us are not comfortable sharing our personal information. So maybe soon we'll be thanking these exchanges for implementing KYC (so they can better protect our funds and trades), but I guess we'll really never know until the time comes lol.
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:21:06
Lol maybe it's time to find another platform?
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:10:24
I love the smell of mornings in the bticoins.
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:13:55
This is great! Welcome to the future!
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:07:02
Wow. I hope that all the people on here eventually get their money back. Forcing users to verify with photo ID while holding your frozen assets is unacceptable. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:26:02
1 year is nowhere near enough for ANY currency, especially one that's new and as unique as bitcoin is. I even feel like 10 years might still be a little too short. The point is that we can't really expect bitcoin to have a rapid development time (because it's so complicated). You can't rush art.
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:57:44
I think the way to go about it (at least for me) is to use several sources of educational material and familiarize yourself with different perspectives and then use all of the perspectives to form your own. Being in crypto is always a learning process, and you have to be willing to keep learning because I don't think there's one certified way of bitcoin trading.
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:05:58
I completely agree! It's the best P2P in the game! 
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:47:18
This is sad. Bitcoin is supposed to help people, especially the countries that are struggling the most. Nigeria, for example, is currently being helped by Paxful to become proficient in Bitcoin, and it has already helped their society.
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:31:57
Man it's really sad that they can't look at the big picture. They don't understand that crypto could save a lot of people, especially now that Venezuela is in such a financial predicament. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:27:49
This is something that needs to be calculated. People talk about how much energy Bitcoin uses, but no one ever questions the banks and financial institutions. *Great* question.
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:54:26
Hoping that there's a bigger dip in the future so I can buy some more lol
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:52:09
Why are you looking for other options? I use Paxful and I'm quite content with their services.
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:34:21
The things that Paxful has done over there in Africa are truly inspiring.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:29:07
It's time to make the switch outta there. I moved to Paxful a long time ago mostly for the gift cards but now I love it because of the service.
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:28:42
At this point, no one can really tell. We probably won't even be around by the time the last bitcoin is mined. Personally, I believe that someone's going to get insanely rich off of it. Just basing my belief on basic supply and demand.
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:33:09
I always recommend Paxful for beginners. It's quick and easy to learn and you could just jump right into it. If you don't know much, they have a bunch of articles to help you and some even include videos.
@_date: 2018-05-21 08:29:56
Well I'm sure it's not as easy as you think it is. Bitcoin is still in its infancy stage and you just gotta give it time to develop.
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:35:23
Good shit! I heard bitcoin is big over there in Africa! Glad to know that Zimbabwe can join in on the fun.
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:07:40
This is great. I wish they had this when I was starting out lol. Oh well, no harm in re-learning everything to maybe just get a better grip of trading.
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:14:02
These guys are freakin' moguls man. What they've done is already so inspiring and I doubt they're near the finish line. 
Btw who else still sees Armie Hammer when people talk about the Winklevoss Twins lol
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:31:12
With Bitcoin, who knows? It fluctuates so much that sometimes I can't keep track of it anymore lol.
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:56:16
@_date: 2018-05-15 03:02:13
Real life satire. How ironic. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 04:16:26
Paxful might be a solid option for you.
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:11:08
Kudos! This is very comprehensive. I wish I had this when I started lol
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:19:52
Paxful is changing the game with stuff like this.
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:57:30
BMW? Missed marketing opportunities over here for bitcoin lolz
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:28:18
I was just reading about the tulip and Beanie Babies bubbles and they definitely are relatable to bitcoin but bitcoin brought us new technology instead of cuddly stuffed toys and pretty flowers.
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:35:14
Stay updated with all news about crypto! It can't hurt to stay informed. Also, buy the f*cking dip!
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:06:24
Welcome to the crypto world! I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one that sees bitcoin as the future. Congratulations on your baby steps! 
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:19:19
Simple economics would probably say yes, assuming that the demand for Bitcoin stays the same or increases. But with a crypto as volatile as this, I think only time will tell.
@_date: 2018-05-22 05:37:24
This is why I believe in Paxful so much.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:51:29
This is great. I've been an avid supported of Paxful since I started trading and I think that this review is spot on. I highly recommend everyone to give it a shot. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:03:58
I believe it to be a trade off. Yeah, the bitcoin program uses a ton of electricity but the resources that our fiat currencies use can't be that minimal as well. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:41:24
I, personally, am not a fan of KYC. Sometimes they ask for too much and it becomes kind of invasive. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:56:31
Oh that's awesome! It's cool cause wasn't that the purpose of bitcoin in the first place: to be able to sent money everywhere without the hassles of a border?
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:14:54
We truly live in an amazing time! The future is here!
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:39:00
Same, I left LBC right after they implemented KYC but damn this is intense lol.
@_date: 2018-05-28 05:53:38
I would like to know as well. I know that there are a few big ones coming up:
1. Next-Gen Blockchain Technology Conference - San Francisco, CA - June 7-8, 2018
2. A Blockchain Conference For Software Engineers - Atlanta, GA, USA - Sept 6-7, 2018
3. Asset Backed Crypto Summit - Lisbon, Portugal - Sept 20-21, 2018
4. Malta Blockchain Summit 2018 - Intercontinental Malta - Nov 1-2, 0218
Any recommendations? (Since I can only probably afford to go to one lol)
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:01:23
Welcome to the world of the future! I wish you the best of luck!
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:09:55
It's a hard-fork of Bitcoin, or it's a split on the Bitcoin blockchain. It's supposed to process transactions quicker and cheaper. In other words, it's a different cryptocurrency that was derived from the blockchain of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:20:06
That better have been some damn good pizza lol
@_date: 2018-05-28 07:57:26
There are bitcoin faucets that could earn you some easy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:30:34
Maybe give paxful.com a shot. They've got over 300 methods of payment, GREAT 24/7 customer support, and a very beginner-friendly user interface (that comes with a bunch of video tutorials to get you started). 
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:20:30
Looks pretty shady to me. Typical Coinbase lol
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:05:42
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:59:51
I'm not sure I quite understand. What would kind of help would PayPal be able to provide for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:43:32
You should give Paxful a try. It's UI is very user-friendly, there are over 300 methods of payment, and they have great 24/7 customer service. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:13:10
Agreed. I don't think Paxful gets the recognition it deserves.
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:34:49
*Graphic design is my passion.*
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:11:57
Crypto is going places! Although the coin that's being advertised looks a little bit shady, it's the thought that counts right? 
@_date: 2018-06-05 03:26:44
I feel that one of the weaknesses of bitcoin (other than its infancy stage lol) is that not everyone understands the amount of research and learning that goes into investing in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:57:31
Any publicity is good publicity I guess lol
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:01:39
Not only is Paxful safe, but is also a great peer-to-peer platform. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:45:10
Damn bro that sucks. I bet we were a month away from you getting your lambo.
@_date: 2018-06-05 03:03:32
Not everyone might not realize it yet, but I do believe that we need cryptocurrency. It has a lot of benefits (of course there are negatives as well) that a lot of people don't understand yet.
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:37:15
Interesting points. Personally, for me, I think that the pros outweigh the cons. I truly believe that crypto is the future and if John McAfee wants to give it the publicity it deserves, then by all means.
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:34:16
That's interesting. I read that they might try to acquire Coinbase? I wish them luck with that since it seems that Coinbase is already getting bigger on their own.
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:00:58
Bitcoin is the future of currency and I believe that everything's going to be okay as well.
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:22:38
There are a lot of options for you out there. Personally for me, I prefer a p2p style of platform. If you're into that, I'd highly recommend Paxful. They've got over 300 methods of payment and great customer support.
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:31:46
Damn dude. I sincerely hope that you get your coins back. It seems that more and more of these issues are popping up everyday for Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:12:53
paxful = best p2p platform in the game
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:57:58
It's interesting to see more and more of these small stalls popping up around the world. I wonder if there's one here in the Philippines.
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:49:27
I've read about this before because I kind of wanted to get into it but I heard it's not worth it anymore and that I'm too late lol.
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:07:41
It's interesting to see different takes on this topic. I, personally, believe that crypto was created to not be regulated but more and more I'm seeing people believe that the currency might be stronger if it were to be regulated. I just watched an interview where Yobie Benjamin (founder of token.io) said that. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:29:14
Baby steps! Soon, everyone will realize that crypto is the future
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:28:44
Maybe a peer-to-peer system would work for you. Look for a platform that accepts gift cards (like paxful)
@_date: 2018-06-06 02:40:12
These are great! Thank you for these! I tried designing my own but it sucked hahahaha!
@_date: 2018-06-06 02:43:06
I get that adoption is important and everything but I find the price posts quite entertaining lol
@_date: 2018-06-04 04:20:20
Paxful is a good source for Amazon gift cards. It's a p2p exchange with over 300 methods of payment and great 24/7 customer support.
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:29:31
Congratulations on buying your first bitcoin! I think dabbling in low amounts is fine. It's all about baby steps and getting comfortable. Take your time!
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:59:49
I see what you did there. I love that one that's just named "Teh".. It's like they gave up with the name.
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:03:44
Probably because bitcoin has no physical aspect to it and those coins are the best representation of them and they're probably gold because I think it's because bitcoin is compared to gold a lot since they are both mined and both worth a hefty amount of money.
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:56:16
Enough of all the altcoins! Bitcoin is OG and it deserves its place as the posterboy for cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:12:23
I don't get the relation between the title and the description. But I do believe that it's safe and that it is growing. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:27:13
I actually used a Paxful wallet (the one that comes free when you register - it served me well for a few months) for a while until I invested more than 500 USD. When I got to that point, I got a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:28:10
Great video! We need to keep this guy making YouTube videos to keep everyone educated and to educate newcomers.
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:00:44
Agreed. Every time the people find a way to gain some control for themselves, the government always tries to take it back and scare other people into getting into it. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:43:50
Welcome to crypto world! It's nerve-wracking yet exciting one. All it takes are baby steps! You'll eventually get to the point where you really want to invest more and more every time. Good luck!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:31:31
Being in it for the technology is like saying you read playboys for the great articles. Why can't it be for both the technology and the money (just like it is for both the articles and the pretty ladies lol)
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:56:44
That's actually quite cool I would love to buy that with my bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:41:37
Paxful is a community of people who conducts their own business, It's much better to support these types of people! Really inspired watching your interviews Ray: [
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:26:35
God's plan.
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:01:10
Paxful is great! The best P2P exchange out there!
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:18:15
This is just sad. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:28:26
I agree! What they're doing in Africa is truly inspiring. Localbitcoins users should consider the switch to Paxful.
@_date: 2018-04-16 08:16:31
April Fools!
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:16:06
in my experience Paxful is way better because of the ability to exchange gift cards... plus they have good values! they help put up schools in africa!
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:10:58
Let's gooooooooooooo
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:13:21
Very informative! 
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:03:02
Fuck those are sick
@_date: 2018-04-23 02:19:56
This is awesome. Paxful is awesome. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:20:12
The ban never really scared me since they can't ban peer-to-peer transactions (like the ones done in Paxful).
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:55:23
Coinbase doesn't mine their own blocks lol. If you ask me, all Coinbase does is provide us with a sketchy platform to trade bitcoin on.
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:31:57
Maybe you just need to wait for a better offer on Paxful? Idk I use it and I've gotten great deals.
