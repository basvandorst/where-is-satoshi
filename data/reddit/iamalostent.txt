Yes, he sent a signed message that exactly matched the transaction record I had.
Learned about it here:

I really hope there is a way, they aren't mine so I don't want them.

No, but I didn't want one anyway.

I just know if it happened to me I would be devastated, and I have struggled hard with depression etc.. in the past. I don't want someone's life to fall apart or end because I was an asshole.

Fine by me, I don't need anyone to believe it I need someone to help me figure out how to track a transaction.

Unfortunately not as the wallet I'm using also shows the value of your wallet in my currency.

I didn't know this would get attention at all so I'm posting this as a general answer to a bunch of questions and if this could be locked I would be thankful.
I don't want anyone's money at all, please don't offer.
No, I did not get to keep any of it, I didn't want to anyway.
The person it belonged to said he isn't sure how it happened he was transferring funds from an online wallet somewhere else and doesn't know how my address ended up in his clipboard. He usually triple checked but as nothing had happened in the past he didn't bother this time.
He found the thread quickly as it happened 8 hours before I posted, he told friends and they were all watching bitcoin forums and communities for any mention of something that might be it.
I wish now I had no used my primary account for this for the amount of shit I'm getting but that's on me. I hope everyone's day is as pleasant as they have been.
Take care.
I'll also add that I don't like exodus wallet. It looks nice but its a shit wallet overall.
