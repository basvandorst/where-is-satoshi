Bilateral trade agreements are being made in an effort to side-step having to use USD to trade oil.  With that being said, over HALF of US dollars are outside of the US.  People losing faith in USD is causing a massive amount of the currency to flood back into America's boarder.  During situations like these, the gov't will buy up treasury bonds to siphon off excess currency in the economy.  The US can only stave off hyper-inflation for so long...

Did you buy the shares directly via cash account or from the company/transfer agent?  Or do you have an advisory/brokerage account w/ a third party (borker dealer, etc.)?  I might be of help bc I currently process this type of thing for my job.

Idk anything about "Bread wallet" but sometimes it can take up to 6 confirmations (about 1 hour) before you can control your funds.  6 confirmations means that 6 blocks have been added to the blockchain since your transaction.  Imo 6 confirmations is a bit overkill, but it serves as a security measure to ensure your transaction is immutable.

Locate your nearest University and check their website for when they do surplus sales.  Sometimes its a bust bc greedy people will literally try to buy everything and resell it at a flee market.  If you stick with it, you WILL get some of the best deals of your life.  The comp that my node runs on has 1TB of SSD storage and 16GB ram for $80.  Just a heads up, people can get pretty crazy during these.

BTC time traveller for those who don't know:

* Helps the network
* Allows the freedom to use the network as you please (chose your own fees, verify transactions, and tons of other things.)
* requires over 165 GB of storage (ballpark estimate).
* Can use a lot of bandwidth. It can be capped provided by the freedom of a full node.
I'm really using it for learning purposes mostly.  I'm running it naturally on default settings and hoping my ISP doesn't rake me over the coals with this month's bill

First of all, welcome!
Just my 2 satoshis:  In the past many people associated market crashes with whale sell-offs, [Mt. Gox trustee]( for example (and others). If a whale decides they've had enough and dump a massive amount of btc, I see it as a healthy redistribution of the finite bitcoins.  If several whales attempt a 'once and for all' destruction of bitcoin's value, it will probably cause a long dark winter with a slow recovery.  However, I genuinely believe there's enough of us who are passionate about the project to scoop up the cheap btc and revitalize the market. After all, bitcoin has been *dead* [360 times](
Good discussion OP

I agree.  I get that people are excited, but I kind of like when btc stabilizes and this sub gets more technical.

Ah okay, thanks for clarifying.

If collisions (2 inputs generate the same output) in the SHA256 started being found, it would probably merit an algo change.  Problems created?  It would really disrupt mining, and all these expensive asics would just become power hungry chunks of metal.  Hash rate would plummet and have to pick back up before the vulnerability could be exploited.  Problems that it could fix?  An asic resistant algo would help level the playing field, and mining could more decentralized since everyone would have access to the hardware needed to mine.

I'm glad to see a newer (correct me if im wrong) community member interested in this space.  Can you elaborate a bit on why you would dump your whole 401k into a BTC ETF?  Is it something to do with liquidity, tax-ability, or simply exposure?  I'm not sure how the ETF will pan out, but I do know that GBTC ( does claim to reserve 0.1 btc per share, but at their current rate (09/21/17) the share price is $655.01 which means that a GBTC holder is paying $6550 per btc vs. $3654 per btc.

We should upvote this post until you get a new Trezor

August 1st btc takes a dive to $2,000 as investors hedge their portfolios with alts to ride out the 'storm'.  Mid august, legacy chain takes over and early 2018 SegWit is finally activated.  Price BOOMS!
