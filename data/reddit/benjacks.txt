True, but it's paramount to understanding the concepts and theory behind it.

Which is quite dumb in my opinion. A currency with a fixed supply leaves absolutely no room for monetary policy to heat up or cool down the economy.

The law of gravity describes that an object of a certain mass will "pull" on another object with a proportional force. Not that either object will move towards the other. To give some context, a bird flying is not defying the law of gravity, the earth is still pulling on it with the same force that it does with every object, it's just that other variables come into play that allow the bird to remain suspended in the air. 
The same principle applies with supply and demand. The "law" states that an increase in supply will put a downward pressure on the price. Other variables may keep the price moving upwards. That's where the "all else equal" applies and is an underlying assumption in the discussion of economic theory.

What the hell does that even mean?

What do you mean I can't buy stuff with my gold hoards and wallet stuffed with bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-08-23 20:17:48
Semantics. Gotcha.

We don't need to know and solve for every variable in existence to know the result. There can be no equation of supply and demand because every market has nique supply and demand curves and it would be impossible to calculate every single one. 
You're right, because humans are involved we cannot establish "laws" like we do in natural sciences like physics. Economics is inherently a social science. But to handwave away concepts that withstand the scrutiny of theory and hundreds of years of empirical study with "we can't know" is disengenous.

Then what was point you were making? Trust me, I think people who argue that are delusional idiots. 
May I ask what these issues are?

Oh of course, we are in agreement here. I think the volatility in BTC price is almost exclusively from demand shocks. 
Although that doesn't mean that the limited supply doesn't put some upward pressure on the price. Demand will never be high enough to facilitate the astronomical prices that the universal adoption crowd predicts.
