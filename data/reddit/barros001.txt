If one day the IRS decide to treat crypto as currency it will most likely treat it the same way foreign currency is treated. For all IRS cares foreign currency is an asset subject to capital gains just like crypto but with one exception. If you make PERSONAL purchases and your PROFIT less than $200 (note that it’s not the transaction value but your profit on the transaction) you’d be exempt from taxes. Anything over $200 ( in profit is taxed as usual. Losses are not allowed on personal transactions regardless of the how big they are. If you spend foreign currency in connection with a trade / business then the rule does not apply and you owe tax on ANY profit, but losses are then allowed as well. That means even if the IRS treats crypto as currency you will still have to be mindful of your spending habits as big purchase / business and investments purchase could still be taxed so you’d still have to keep track of your cost basis. But for most people it will be of great help.

Guess what? The scenario you just described as being stupid is actually pretty real. You would owe tax after buying your dildo in RUB. I’m being serious, I deal with international taxation for several years. Buying dildos is a personal transaction so there’s. $200 limit (if I’m not mistaken) where you don’t really owe taxes. But yes, spending any currency other than USD for anything could be a taxable event. If personal not if you don’t profit more than 200, if investiment (BTC) then even a penny is taxable. Don’t underestimate the reach if he IRS :)
