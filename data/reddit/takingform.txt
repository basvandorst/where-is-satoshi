It matters not, if you want to be anonymous, you will fins the way. It just hinders bitcoin integration, that's all

Puts millions of parasites in their right place, you mean.

Good, but what makes you so sure?

Waiting for the next bounce up to cash out and rebuy, how long do think it's going to take?
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:34:52
You absolutely don't cash out millons in one transaction. Greedy bitches will take it for themselves, given the opportunity. Take your time, use different banks, different cards, different countries, different amounts of cash out.

Why don't they stop people tgat shit on the streets first
@_date: 2019-11-18 18:31:13
Yeah you can lose some small amount of money to overly suspicious bank, but it's still better than losing everything in one big fuck up.

In 20 years they will have small autonomous spy drones everywhere, and big combat drones anywhere somebody've decide to write shit about The Holy Govt. Mark my words

Be careful with those billions, you're going to have a heart attack!
@_date: 2019-11-03 12:27:32
Just buy and sell it online, for fuck sake. Those regulations are useless
@_date: 2019-11-20 15:14:43
Due to fraud, of course, it's all because of bitcons! Let's be frank here - after each fraudulent transaction people feel involuntary urge to go out and shit on the streets.

Nice way to justify anything, like, now we can say that workers of Zyklon-B producing facilities are innocent, hey, it's just mothers and fathers trying to make a living and feed their children. You see my point? But that's not all. 
Back then they were, indeed, innocent, because information weren't as accesible as it is now. Now everyone can open their eyes and see what banking is for real. It's the cause of wars, you mind that words, and every single little hamster tapping theirs worktime away on a nice little PC behind a nice little desk is digging a nice little graves for their children. Simple as that.

It dropped 500 to raise 5000, bro, that's the way it goes.

Banks and oligarchy already hold majority of BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:23:04
Well it seems to be only natural to me. But you got a point here
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:52:38
No clue whatsoever
@_date: 2019-10-07 02:03:09
I don't think that long-term holders will sell even at 6k, because the downtrend doesn't last forever, it quickly reverses. BTC is too good.
@_date: 2019-10-07 02:23:47
How did you get scammed? Is your 2-step verificaion even active?
@_date: 2019-10-07 01:43:48
So guys do you think that recent downtrend is triggered by situation in HK?
@_date: 2019-12-01 03:42:24
Boo-hoo, company property! It's BANKS. They cause WARS. Stealing their property is the mildest thing to do.
