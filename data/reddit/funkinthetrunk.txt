I think it's got potential to replace bank cards because the Visa network costs a lot per transaction for vendors to offer.
Still, Litecoin is the better option for buying coffee, IMO
your general point is one I kinda agree with, though. Regular people don't care as long as it works.
People bitching here about PayPal miss the point that most people have seemless transactions via their platform. All that matters is "smooth and low hassle"

During the late 90s bubble in Silicon Valley, anything with "dot-com" got funded, no matter how flimsy the concept. The peak of this phenomenon was pets.com, a company that managed to *buy a Super Bowl ad* and subsequently became the poster child for failed start-ups in the bubble.

@_date: 2018-01-22 21:06:21
this is how Korea's economy works. The chaebol (big conglomerates) identify a threat in a particular market sphere, then the government threatens an outright ban or similar authoritarian measures. While activities slow amid the uncertainty, and there may be a temporary ban, the chaebol have time to either rush a competitor to the market or regain their footing via new strategies or legal intervention. 
In this case, Korean banks saw that they could be the onramp to the exchanges. The government likes this because it combats the potential force anonymity and allows them to put the burden of monitoring individuals on the banks themselves. Likely, Koreans will be restricted by bank policies to use only specific exchanges subject to Korean laws (if they weren't already)
For other examples of this, see Korea's responses to Google Maps, Uber/Lyft, Airbnb, and the internet in general.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:57:06
I just don't understand why Korea's government should care whether BTC prices are stable. There's so much more to this than they say
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:44:59
I bet they'll ban foreigners from using exchanges though.
that way they can crush arbitrage, which seems to be their goal

@_date: 2018-01-10 09:29:31
I think a coin that guarantees some level of anonymity will always have a place. I also think any coin that can successfully brand itself and make the public aware of its virtues can be more viable than Bitcoin. If Google released a crypto tomorrow, BTC would be DOA
Ultimately, it's all about network size and so adoption is the most important thing to give a currency value. So I know everyone wants "the best technology" to win out, but that ain't how the world of capitalism works. Best marketing wins out. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:38:53

Amazon and Facebook have really only benefitted the moneyed classes. They offer the rest of us convenience at the cost of our privacy and many other external social costs. Your fawning over them shows your ignorance.
Facebook is a platform that abuses human dopamine reflexes to make money for advertisers. Your benefit is that you can spout your opinions to your friends without putting on clothes.

That's not transforming the architecture. That's sneakernetting private keys
@_date: 2018-08-07 05:47:55
Sneakernet is a network where data is physically moved by walking the distance between two nodes, hence "sneakers". Oftentimes, during the days of dial-up, it was faster (or maybe more secure) to walk to your friend's house with a CD than to upload that content to his computer. 
the article describes their proposed setup in such a way as to imagine that's their method. Private keys would be held entirely offline, kept in a vault, controlled by the bank itself. 
Basically, their offchain network "layer" is taking a private address with your name tagged on it and changing the tag to my name after the transaction. So the transaction takes place off chain, in a vault, with a guy literally changing name tags or whatever they have.
@_date: 2018-08-07 08:44:11

I asked about this exact scenario you all are talking about -- a so-called bearwhale -- many months ago.  People in this subreddit told me it would be "nearly impossible" to sell so many BTC at once and that even if it happened, there'd be "no noticeable acffect" on values because to sell so many would mean there was a buyer.

Well, same with stocks but this doesn't mean people sit around and hold onto their stocks. Indeed, such risky investment strategies regularly screw over the average stockholder. It's why insider trading is illegal.
With BTC, there's no regulation so you could collude with others, thereby creating "the right time."
The only limitation I can think of was suggested by another commenter: They'd have to find people willing to buy BTC from them in a volume tremendous enough to liquidate quickly

No. You're not thinking about it very much because you think that you understand it, therefore so should everyone else. 
I'm a casual Bitcoin user. I'd like to have more involvement and more Bitcoin but there's a real risk of losing money forever. I have Mycelium on my phone but I don't put BTC there because Coin base seems safer and easier than having to keep track of a wallet. What if my phone stops working? 
I tried to get Bitcoin software going on my computer but every time I tried to download the blockchain it failed because it took too long. Why did my computer have to download the entire blockchain for me to have a wallet? 
I'm not some schmuck who can't use computers. I'm a guy who enthusiastically tries out new technology. Bitcoin is a baffling experience.

No, you miss the point. The very idea that we have to "back up" our money is a layer of hassle that an average person just doesn't wanna deal with.
I'm a Linux user. If Linux came pre-installed on every PC, people would have no problem with it. But because they have to actively seek it out, and then they have to learn how to install it, and sometimes there are compatibility issues and lack of available software, people aren't flocking to Linux. But as soon as you slap it on a phone ready to go, like Android, people are totally on board.
Bitcoin needs its own "Android," a mostly seamless experience that involves no extra effort on the part of the end user. There's a reason I just stick with Coin Base.
Bitcoin might be the greatest currency ever invented, but superior technology is routinely discarded by human societies. See also: Dvorak keyboards

The internet is only the internet if all traffic is equal. Stop being an edgel0rd for two seconds and understand how and why the technology works and benefits society. 
The monopolies were granted because putting down lines is expensive and disruptive, and these companies already had the infrastructure in place. Local monopolies make a certain amount of sense, with government acting as a guarantor against abuse. That's literally the most fundamental job of government
The telcos aren't going to lose their monopolies, they're just going to be able to milk consumers while providing a crappier product.
And if you think these companies are going to guarantee against censorship, you're a naíf. They have their own interests that are vastly different from yours and mine

How did they censor Wikileaks? Not by blocking the site but by going through corporate intermediaries like Visa.
If the government actually blocks Wikileaks, a lawsuit can be brought to challenge the law. If Visa refuses to process payments to Wikileaks, you have to pound sand. The court system has centuries of law. Corporate governance has whatever they feel suits their bottom line right now
@_date: 2019-02-08 01:12:02
In China, everyone has fully integrated payment across a range of apps and services that moves money to and from their banks. It's instant, seamless, and convenient and has no fees for individual users

THIS. So fucking much. History is full of better technologies being abandoned for reasons that don't serve the public's best interests, often due to short-term business/financial concerns.
Jared Diamond has written extensively on this phenomenon, using examples as wide-ranging as Dvorzak keyboards and Australian aboriginals refusal to use archery.
Remember Betamax, Lazerdisc, and miniCDs? They were superior technologies but they were crushed by inferior technologies.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:42:11

@_date: 2017-11-22 08:15:42
The government, who developed the technology, then granted telecommunications companies legal monopolies.
Like, okay, what's the best thing about the internet? Probably the fact that anybody can host a server or get their opinions out there, right? Literally anybody can contact Wikileaks, or host documents themselves. There's access to an uncensored world of information. That only works with guaranteed traffic equality. Without it, your favorite blog, your favorite bbs, your favorite file-sharing site, etc, are all subject to the whims of corporate decision-making and a system based on pay to play.
Equal traffic access is a real backstop against government censorship, akin to allowing free speech.
You're falling on the wrong sword, here
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:36:18
The government wasn't regulating the internet, it was ensuring that telcos don't abuse their monopolies

IPFS is maybe the most interesting one, at least to me. You can store your files in a distributed network and only you have the code to find it. It's similar to bitcoin and crypto. Zeronet is based on Ethereum, IIRC, and instead of passwords you have a wallet address

*Chaebol* are the large family-owned corporations that wield enormous influence over Korean government economic policies. They are largely unaccountable to public concerns. They include Samsung, LG, Doosan, and many others. They have their fingers in every economic pie, often through holding companies. For example, Airbnb threatens Samsung's "tourist motel" holdings, so its use has been heavily legislated by the Korean government -- no Koreans are allowed to use it as guests and Korean hosts must be clearly demonstrable homestay experiences. A more relevant example for this thread is Google Maps vs. Naver / Daum Maps. Google is not given map information for "security" reasons, however, Korean conglomerates like Naver and Daum and Kakao get complete access to all map information in Korea, including *real-time* subway and bus locations. This information is publicly available in the native language of the North, which immediately makes me see that it's a lie to keep Google out of the space. Google Maps have not been updated, in some cases, since 2009.
Often, Korean companies need time to catch up to the situation presented by outside forces and actors. Such is certainly the case with cryptocurrencies. They probably have little understanding of it so rather than deal with it immediately, they can get it heavily regulated and then figure out how to exploit it for themselves or create a more "harmless" (for their position) alternative.
Is this *definitely* happening? Hey, maybe not. However, there is a pattern of such behavior in the Korean political/economic system such that I take all proclaimed "security" threats with some skepticism.

dude, no shit. This toxic libertarianism in the community needs to die already.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:12:44
I don't think you get what tax is. It's a communal solution to the problem of no individual having enough money to provide specific goods and services. Just like a health insurance pool or a lottery. The good thing about taxes is that the money is, in principle, used for the benefit of all and the officials in charge of its use are accountable to the tax paying public. In practice, that has turned out kinda badly, mostly because "small government no tax" logic pervades our political system now, giving cover to cut services to the general public but increasing spending on things with limited social benefit, ie, the military.
At the end of the day, though, the public do have some control over the situation and have legitimate claims to be upset over how it's spent. In a privatized libertarian utopia, the public have ZERO legitimate claim to a right to oversee how money will be spent on public goods like roads, education, health and safety, etc
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:25:31
Statist is a blanket term that precludes all discussion because it comes with the *a priori* assumption that collectively determined institutions are inherently bad. So it's literally closing the debate rather than finding any workable real-world solutions.

Having now been involved in some crypto and blockchain related industry events and organizations, I think there's nothing organic going on. It's all a bunch of people trying to cash in on investor FOMO. The very idea that a blockchain token is an investment vehicle is simply people who feel left out trying to chase after the "next" Bitcoin. "Pushed by the people" my ass. It's just dev teams hiring marketing people to convince investors that their coin is the next big thing. It's all marketing hype
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:13:53

@_date: 2017-09-22 21:51:50
Yeah, I'd obviously switch to BCH and then jump off a cliff because he said so
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:45:44
You were a student with savings? Wow
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:37:19
It's relevant... I want to know what people here think about it and how I can safely navigate my BTC through the split

Can't wait until they try to set up a road system
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:44:57
Can confirm.

He's using media to communicate to other elites and their institutions. He's basically saying that the government should be prepared to take such actions, while also keeping the price down long enough that he and his peers can buy up more and more of it. If they get in now with a big enough stake, they can control it in the near future. They are a pod of bear whales
@_date: 2017-09-24 07:13:03
They can comprehend decentralization but this guy is ignorant of what Bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:58:37
The Cryptoverse guy has an interesting ICO going that I wish I could get in on.
However, yeah, I agree that most are probably scams. Just like many IPOs!
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:36:23
How come nobody ever lists Coinomi? I think it's a good wallet! The UI is really simple
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:50:21
I'm really thinking that I should join you
@_date: 2017-10-06 07:44:20
Of course he did. He's America's biggest scumbag
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:28:30
sure but the idea is that crypto will be a means of exchange, not some interchangeable asset with fiat currency. If/when that happens, its value will be tied to other things
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:32:42
Fuck your stupid doublespeak
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:26:20
So here is the day. But why would they adopt a Bitcoin amidst all this community turmoil?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:30:46
RemindMe! 1095 days

Have you ever heard of a bail-in?
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:57:11
Yeah, I love Yves but she sometimes sounds completely out of touch with people in general
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:55:58
I mean, didn't he try to hire hit men or something?

The lesson I always tell my friends is "There's no crying in Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:16:26
S2X is clearly bullshit to help a minority of stakeholders, and without replay protection it leaves a lot of people at risk.

There's terrific friction to entry. My friends and I can't buy on exchanges due to our banks abd/or credit cards not being accepted.

Cash is not dead in China.

@_date: 2017-10-17 09:34:27
So I should frame it as a technology to be invested in rather than an asset?

foreign residents and foreign nationals can't open new exchange accounts. current accounts can no longer deposit fiat

How can I run a full node?
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:38:50
No, he's not ... Now I'm really worried about BTC
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:11:17
You're worried about "shafting the miners" but Bitcoin doesn't exist to enrich miners...
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:44:18
non-Korean users?
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:57:23
401k?what's that?
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:20:46
Yes, we are all invested in the Linux Desktop of currencies
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:09:46
Fuck off with your racist title, OP
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:40:36
Obviously he's a real cowboy pioneer with a ranch on land that he settled BEFORE that communist Homestead Act was put into place. He don't need no help from anybody, as long as as has his internet connection, electricity, computing device and his digital currency.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:37:05
or by just blocking access to the network
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:45:34
But that's not the point of the OP
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:00:54
Is this even true?
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:45:36
RemindMe! Six months
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:39:29
yeah I think this might be the best line of reasoning. Coupling it with the fact that BTC is FOSS and has a vibrant community might get him to at least engage a bit.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:17:11
Yeah they blocked my bank after I sent BTC to Nitrogensports.eu
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:23:55
None of this matters if the current arrangement has a better UI and marketing
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:13:58
Similar. I have a wire transfer that's been pending for ~4 days
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:59:36
I think maybe OP is not a native English speaker
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:20:13
I don't think it's hodlers as much as day traders.
But yeah, if adoption as a means of commercial transaction doesn't ever take place hold then it's basically worthless
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:54:24
Yeah, let's encourage Bitcoin adoption with expensive cars that nobody buys
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:53:00
This is good advice. I've been offering to help people who are interested but then realized that I will be seen as responsible if anything goes wrong. So I just try to send them to educational things instead, and give them basic security tips
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:17:07
So I "did my research" on this, and their website still touts Coinomi as open source. However, their Github lists the latest version as 1.6x and hasn't been updated in 8 months. The version available in the Android app store is version 1.7x and was updated September 20.

No because the church of neoliberal banksters award it to those who preach their dogma

Because Bitcoin isn't actually in the world. It a note on a ledger, which is kept electronically. If the power goes out, you have no money

What about the whole  thing? They were talking about making a trillion-dollar coin 
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:38:22
It's been a thing for more than 20 years and it had serious people supporting it in 2011-12
@_date: 2016-05-01 16:13:28

It started out as such but now it's clearly a tool for authoritarian capitalist control. But that's not what I'm commenting on. 
What's the point of space Wi-Fi? Mobile data already exists. It's just more shit to put into the sky, wasting resources and energy while we need to be focusing on sustainable solutions to the coming climate crisis that threatens our entire society.
