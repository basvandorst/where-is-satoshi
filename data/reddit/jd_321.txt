Averaged % price increase would be a better metric imo. This basically just looks at 2017 because previous years price is insignificant in comparison.

Audited by KPMG... how 'independent' of them! 
Seriously though, the Fed answers to no-one. Congress cannot even ask them what banks they have lent money to! That is not an audit.. if information as trivial as this is not included.

I never said that chinny. The point I'm trying to make is that something that benefits those with money at the expense of those without money, like inflation, is not a good thing. You can try to twist my words and narrow in on the finer details whilst missing the point if you so chose. At the end of the day there are millions of people out there with a small amount of savings who cannot invest it. And even if they could, most are not aware of the options they have or don't have the time to look into it because they are too busy working 3 jobs to keep food on the table. These are the people who suffer most from inflation. From your comments I am sure you do not belong to this class of people and probably don't give a fuk either so lucky you.  
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:35:16
 you are wrong.
1981-2007 income gains (inflation adjusted) 
*Richest 1% = 264%
*Richest 20% = 95%
*Middle 20% = 25%
*Poorest 20% = 16% 
Oh but everyone is making gains so it's ok? No, it's not. Shit is out of control.

You can only claim 100% of losses if you have enough gains in that year also to claim them against. If you have a terrible year, the max you can carry over into subsequent years is 3K. That is a joke, sure 'its the law' and all that crap but the reason for public forums like this is to discuss issues and flaws in the current system so maybe... just maybe... one day we can change them. Or I guess we can all just accept that 'its law' and go on being the mindless,'unhappy', slaves our masters want us to be. People like you do not help make change. Just sayin'

Inflation devalues all currency. By hoarded do you mean someones retirement plan? I wouldn't call that hoarding, I would call that doing what you have to do in order to be able to support yourself after your working career. These are the people that are most hurt by inflation. Those creating the money and those benefiting massively from its creation (banks, their CEO's and shareholders, governments, the military and weapons manufacturers) all get to spend this money before it inflates the economy. They spend it before the cost of everything increases. Inflation is not a form of wealth re-distribution. It steals value from those who worked hard for their savings and re-distributes it to those creating money out of thin air and those directly associated with them. I find it interesting why you think it works the opposite to this though. 
Things started getting way out of hand in the USA as soon as they went off the gold standard. As soon as the monetary system went from being backed by something physical, something somewhat limited in supply to being backed by nothing. Nothing but confidence. Printed to oblivion like dozens of fiat currencies before it and after it. Have a look at whats going on in Venezuela or what happened in Zimbabwe where people are sifting through piles of cash trying to find something to eat. Or pushing a wheelbarrow full of cash around and you are more worried someone will steal your wheelbarrow. 
You're probably going to say that there is a magic balance where printing money is sustainable as long as its in line with economic growth. That is false. Our measure of inflation doesn't even take into consideration the cost of housing or energy. If it did the inflation rate would be through the roof right now. Printing money only benefits those printing it or those closely associated with those printing it. Everyone else suffers. 
So yes, I think Bitcoin or another crypto could be a solution but I would like to see one backed by gold/silver something real. I also have issues with the current massive disparity of wealth distribution within the bitcoin ecosystem as well. It's no better and possibly worse than the current system so it's definitely not ideal but a step in the right direction.

Printing money steals current wealth through inflation and hands it to those printing the money. Mostly to finance war and bail outs. The current system of privately owned banks creating money out of thin air and lending it to our governments so we can pay it back through taxation + interest is the biggest scam in the history of humans. 
The US federal reserve at least admits it is a privately owned company. The Australian reserve bank on the other hand is much more secretive.
 As per RBA’s website, “The Bank is a body corporate wholly owned by the Commonwealth of Australia.”
Who owns the Commonwealth of Australia? The Queen? No.. The people? Don't be ridiculous... If the people owned it why do we owe a debt to ourselves? As per this page on the SEC’s website, it is registered to:
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA CIK 0000805157
Business Address
1601 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW
C/O AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY
WASHINGTON DC 20036
It's a privately owned company... Just like the US 'federal' reserve. Scam. Their time ruling the world is coming to an end. People are waking up and seeing this for what it really is.

The benefits of the Fed are privatized yet it is ultra secretive and all powerful. It's even worse than a completely private company because of this. 
This is a bit of a watch but i highly recommend taking the time as it explains how the federal reserve came to be and how evil and unconstitutional it is.

This is a hyperthetical situation but I'm pretty sure this is how it works and would like some input if I'm wrong. Bitcoin trades at 20k near the end of the year and you've been in and out of alts / btc for 12 months, therefore owe a lot of tax, even though it's all crypto to crypto with no fiat realised gains. You still owe 30% of the 20k 'gains' you've made,  even though none of them were actually realised and at any moment those 'gains' could vaporise. Then as soon as the tax year ends everything comes crashing down and the Max you can claim as a loss is 3 grand? So, let's get this straight. You're paying 30% of 20k = 6k tax but when you lose all those profits and more, as many people have, the most you can offset these losses is 3k?

Oh man... The money supply is most definitely growing, doesn't matter what anyone thinks it's doing. The fact is it's growing at a rapid rate. A trillion dollars in the last 6 months even. 
That does not mean everyone is going to suddenly become more rich though. Is that what you're saying? A larger money supply equals more wealth?

The president is a dictator and human rights criminal who has already destroyed the last 2 (yes TWO) Venezuelan fiat currencies through hyper inflation due to corruption and essentially money printing to oblivion. Do a google search. Having crypto associated with the likes of Nicolas Maduro is not a good thing.

The rich do not have their wealth in bank accounts, they have it in profit generating businesses and other assets like the stock market. Therefore inflation dos not devalue their wealth like it does the poor who may have a small nest egg in a savings account or worse still tucked under their mattress because they are too poor to get a bank account at all. 
Just look at the Venezuelan  stock market, inflation is out of control but the stock market is crushing it. Do you think any of the poor people in Venezuela own stocks? 
No its not an argument of emotion, its a statement of fact. Inflation affects those that work hard for their currency, not those that let their money work for them.
Let me rephrase that - inflation is a form of wealth concentration. From the poor to the rich. To re-distribute is to give out to everyone. With inflation this does not happen. At most I could agree that it takes from everyone but the % it takes from the poor is much higher and if you take into account factors like the stock market booming in times of inflation then this further offsets any actual losses the rich may have. again, look at the link above for how the super rich structure their wealth. Inflation does not reduce their wealth it improves it. 
Bitcoin is a step in the right direction as the money supply is limited and cannot simply be increased to benefit the few at the cost of the many. I agree that if money is created and given to sectors of the economy that actually produce things (not just the housing, military and financial sectors) then this can stimulate the economy and create growth. The problem is that this doesn't happen so taking away this power completely seems to be the only solution. I also question the viability of an economy that hinges on growth for its survival as the planet simply cannot sustain growth forever and many specialists in the field believe the planet is already overpopulated many times over. Does this mean we need a complete shake-up of our entire economic policy, monetary system included? Yes, I believe it does.

I think you really need to take a few gigantic steps out and have a look a little further from home. As good as you may think the good ole USA has it (not that I agree mind you) what about the rest of the world? What about those living on cents per day or even less. To say it's the best we've ever seen so we should be happy is both incorrect and defeatist. A result of our programming no doubt. Being grateful is one thing but accepting a wrong because it's always been wrong is a tragic tale.

If you're looking for more stability check out vaultoro.com, you can buy gold with your bitcoin that is fully insured, stored and audited by 3rd parties. Easily trade between btc/gold and move your btc or take possession of the physical gold. Current gold price is significantly lower than spot too so definitely a good time to get some gold!

What I'm getting at is that the system is seriously slanted against the tax payer. If you have 20k crypto gain in 2017 and a 20k crypto loss in 2018, what is fair would be that you don't end up paying any tax on your crypto trades when combining those two years. In reality what happens is you end up paying 17k in taxes. That is fundamentally wrong.

People using btc in commerce is the only reason it is worth anything today.

So what the govt would have you do is cash out at the end of of every year, pay your taxes as required then start again. But... Investing is a risky business, especially in crypto. Is it fair that the government gets 100% of the upside (which could be 100's of thousands of dollars per individual) yet when things don't work out the Max offset on future gains they offer is a measly 3k? Keep in mind this isn't the government giving away money, it's just the ability for the tax payer to average out profits and losses over their working life and actually pay the tax that they should. It's a scam in my opinion. We are all taxed more than enough already.

Why is it a valid point? Current recommendations are based on current price. When the price goes up the mining  reward should be adjusted to a level that is high enough to attract enough miners, with their equipment and running costs, but not so high that it results in a network that nobody wants to use because fees are too high.

No it's actually the opposite, inflationary due to expansion of the money supply and devaluation of the dollar and the associated reduction in its purchasing power. 
You do realise that a deflationary currency actually increases in purchasing power. So instead of everything progressively getting more expensive it does the opposite and your dollar gradually buys more. This is the whole premise behind bitcoin and it's limited supply. The powers that be would have everyone believe that a deflationary currency is a terrible, terrible thing, but in reality it's the opposite to the current bent system. 
So no, I don't mean a deflationary, quite the opposite. The pile left over is gradually worth less and less due to inflation!
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:50:08
I understand that losses can be carried over but why only 3K per year? If you lose 20K one year at 3K per year it will take you nearly 7 years to be able to claim this loss back. throw another couple of 20k losses in their (highly possible in this industry) and you may never get the chance to claim your losses during your working career. The system is broken and this is just one tiny aspect.
