Who’s ready for a good ‘ole Tuesday afternoon rally!?

Asia won’t have anything on the USA come 12 hours from now. It’s the second pay day since Tax day. But also, it’s the ‘first of the month’ Friday.
Bitcoin will hit 10k+easily by 9am

Early to mid-April will tell the tale
A lot of whales are paying their taxes by raising capital from bitcoin sales. Check back after April and the price will be up again.
Look for 5k bottom before mid April. Will be a good time to buy

Not really expecting a lot right now. Last Friday was my first paycheck after Tax day and I went all in, as did many others in the US. I expect some selling off until the next pay day Friday.
Japan and Korea ain’t shite they won’t be driving this price up anytime soon this afternoons

Asia is woke!

We are waking up in the US and this is the first pay-check Friday after Tax day...it’s on. I did my part already. I, like many, have cut my retirement contributions in half so I can invest more in bitcoin every two weeks

Oh my bad. I thought those fkers had the ability to get up on their back legs and run sideways?
Who does that? Gecko?
Someone Google it I’m waiting

I’m new to this with just relatively little invested. But this is silliness now. If price manipulation has taken hold why should anyone hold, or use bitcoin as a store of value at this point? I’ll be back in when regulation can curb this obvious abuse by the few very wealthy

Weird. The man didn’t say anything about them being false or unreliable. He said, especially during the election, they were ‘selectuve’ About the information, damaging information they chose to release.
I didn’t vote for either candidate but it was obvious Wikileaks hated Hillary. Why no bombs on Trump? How come they’ve never exposed Putin? That guy is rough

Da fuq is dis shite?

Asia contingent about to get going. About to get that 9k, but then right back down to 8950.
I may throw some bones at Bcash for this pump about to start

If you’ve been paying attention, once the weekend hits and the regular markets close, Cryptomsrkets get an infusion of all kinds of ‘throw away’ fiat from investors looking for stuff to do. This bull run will magnify normal weekend gains
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:39:46
Volumes are falling back down. Probably means we are going to have some ‘fake’ bull-runs in this bear market. Buy the dip.

Someone talk to me about 6-hour charts. Are we going to see some wild trading around 5pm est (4 central) today?
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:14:42
Sideways trading folks. This is a Salamander market
(Don’t they walk sideways)

Wow. I went all in with 30k yesterday...this is how the bulls repay me! Let me tell you how USA sentiment works. My boys who didn’t listen to me in Alabama are now buying in. This will be out of reach for the West Coast by the time they wake up
