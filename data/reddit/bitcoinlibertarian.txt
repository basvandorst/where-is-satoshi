To say that micropayments are dead on arrival, at a time when the medium for such micropayments has just arrived strikes me as a position one would take only if he had underlying negative feeling toward that medium.  
Sanswork, you strike me as quite a hostile individual.  I know a lot of people who are hostile toward bitcoin in general, because they feel like they missed out on vast wealth opportunities.  I got into bitcoin at $7.00/coin, but I was already a multimillionaire when I first invested, so it's difficult for me to put myself into the shoes of someone who watched this incredible technology develop, but never had the balls to invest himself.

How would Paypal make money providing transaction processing for free?  It wouldn't, and so it isn't a sustainable business model.  Micropayments are sustainable under a crypto system.  
As bitcoin becomes more mainstream the micropayment option will become more available for more people.  
Obviously in a world where cryptocurrencies are unheard of by most people, studies won't bode well for crypto-based micropayments.  But, as I already pointed out, there should be no mental cost associated with spending hundredths or thousandths of a penny.
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:28:57
Paypal has the best micropayment option of any of the mainstream payment processors, and it still charges $0.05 plus 5% at a minimum.  
So, obviously, you could never get below five cent micropayments, and you are right, most people wouldn't be interested in that.  
But almost everyone in America would give up a hundredth of a cent or a thousandth of a cent per website in order to never have to deal with website ads again.  The cost to the user is de minimis, but to the website operator it could be lucrative.

Why would it matter what Satoshi thinks?  He had a great idea once, but bitcoin was full of bugs and errors, which had to be corrected by others.

The process of purchasing the tickets was very easy. However, I opted for the digital barcode to be sent to my phone, and the kid who was taking the tickets didn't know wtf to do when  I showed him the barcode on my phone. That could have happened even without the use of bitcoin, though.

No, Visa can't transfer fractions of a penny profitably.  You are simply incorrect about that.

@_date: 2015-02-05 15:13:39
I think most people want drugs eliminated. But, as the saying goes, " want in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills up first." You will never eliminate illicit drugs. The proof is that while anti-drug spending has skyrocketed over the past thirty years, drug prices have gone down, purity levels have gone up, and availability is at an all-time high for most drugs. So, you are wrong, Bought, the drug war has increased violent crime while doing little to reduce the availability of drugs.

Most violent crime in America is caused by drug prohibition. Yet, there has been a de minimis amount associated with the virtual drug trade. Had those billions of dollars in transactions taken place face-to-face, there is no telling how many lives would have been lost. Ross Ulbricht should be awarded the Nobel Peace prize. He's saved more lives than Laureate Obama.
@_date: 2015-02-05 11:19:38
But, those actions by Ross are a rare example of attempted violence in the virtual drug world. In almost all transactions on SR and other sites, the buyer and seller don't know each other. Therefore, they can't commit violence against each other as they do in the physical world. They may want to, but it's impossible.

I didn't say he was free from violence. But, he has certainly saved many more lives than he has taken, which even according to the prosecution is zero.

It would depend on where the suit was initiated. Australia has a "loser pays" system. So, if Wright lost he would probably have to pay the defendant's attorneys fees and other costs.
