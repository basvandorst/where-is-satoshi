I am not sure I understand correctly BUT does it mean I lose the fee to get the money? for example if the fee is $20 and the amount I want to confirm is about $50, So I lose $20 to get $50? or do I confirm the $50 and also get the $20 that I spent as a fee?

I am the one receiving the btc not the one who sent the btc, is there a way for the sender to boost the transaction confirmation time?

So once I send my bitcoins to wasabi wallet , it gets mixed / cleaned immediately? or can I get some more extra layers of security like Monero to Wasabi to coinmixer to bitcoin wallet?

I saw this post online so I would like to know what you guys think about it:
Using bitaddress.org is silly because it’s totally not needed and exposes you to extra risk. Make a simple and easy paper wallet with Notepad! ( using Electrum )!
0. Open up your bitcoin software (such as Electrum)
1. Copy your bitcoin address with your bitcoins in it.
2. Paste that bitcoin address into Notepad
3. Copy that bitcoin address’ private key (right click on the address under the Receive tab in Electrum). Enter your Electrum password when it prompts you, and it will show you the private key. Copy the private key.
5. Paste the private key under the bitcoin address you just pasted into NotePad in Step 2.
6. Print out your Notepad text document with your bitcoin address and private key on it. You’re done. Paper wallet created!
7. Put your nice new paper wallet in a secure place.
