Hilarious... "team" ... Team of fake accounts? Or if some of them are real people they are either in on the scam or unfortunate victims as well.
It all wreaks of a scam. The pre selling of ads, subscriptions, referrals, all cash-grabs and then delay, delay, delay, excuses, etc.
Can't wait for it all to finally go away.
His facades are now starting to crumble though.

The down-votes are from your various fake accounts, that is clearly obvious to anyone who reads a handful of your posts. Beyond that you only distract and flame, a typical tactic for someone with no real defence for their position.
You are preying upon an underage girl (who looks even younger than she supposedly is) by pretending to be someone who can make her famous and "help" her.
You are a despicable predator and a pathetic con-man. No slander here, just relaying information and pointing out the obvious.

His attention-seeking narcissism is just one of the many elements of his personality that point to him being a sociopath.
His "letter" is very revealing. When you read it while considering him as a sociopath, it shows he has all of the classic signs. He is bad for Bitcoin and anyone who has the misfortune of falling for his lies.

You don't "know any cute Asian models", you are a sexual predator, big difference.

So MNW is actually a pedophile and not just trying to be one.
@_date: 2012-04-08 20:24:35
Scamming pedo creeper is doing this.
@_date: 2012-04-17 14:26:46
Now pedo scammer MNW is posting pics of him with this girl in a tiny bikini soliciting "donations" for a "photo shoot".
@_date: 2012-04-09 14:15:55
His Bitcoin vapor ragazine is a complete scam and now he has started posting his pedo model pics of the underage girl he is preying on.
@_date: 2012-04-07 21:48:37
Scammed in the past? You mean scamming now and continuing to scam... and be a pedophile.
@_date: 2012-04-07 01:29:03
"hack" is a compliment. He's a pedo scammer who can't even pay his own rent.
@_date: 2012-04-17 16:11:50
He was bragging about her being 17. He is still preying upon a girl who is not an adult.
He is also now soliciting "donations" for a supposed photoshoot with her while posting pictures of himself with her in a bikini that is completely inappropriate.
By his own admission he was told that promoting this girl was out of line, but now he is asking people to give him money in the process. The only thing it has to do with Bitcoin is that he is trying to get payment in Bitcoin for his "donations".
Debate the pedo side all you like but it's inappropriate.
The scamming by now asking for "donations" is obvious.

There is no argument to dissect, and just because you say "Wrong" does not make it so.
The video and your involvement with a 17 year old girl, supposedly for the benefit of Bitcoin, speaks for itself. What you have done (or gotten away with) as opposed to your intentions are not the semantics that matter. 
Your so-called "Pre-order" was only recently changed to that designation. People "pre-ordered" that "magazine" with an expected delivery of January. Yet month after month, excuse after excuse for why it's not ready and still no sign of completion, just empty promises.  No mention of the amount of money you yourself collected or what you have done with those funds. 
The points I have posted are consistent and only relay other information that is easily found about you. If these posts are so inaccurate and unfounded then why continue? You do have many other targets and hangouts where you claim to also have "value".

Another scam from the pedophile scammers at the fake zine that is never going to be published.

This is not about hating Bitcoin, it's about trying to rid Bitcoin of one of it's worst parasites.
@_date: 2012-04-17 17:10:41
Why is he soliciting "donations" then?
Why does he need to collect Bitcoins for her?
Because he is a scammer and a predator.
@_date: 2012-04-10 19:45:27
You are the scamming pedo creeper, she is the victim. Your response is just another (feeble) attempt by you to draw attention away from the fact that you are a sexual predator who preys upon underage girls.
@_date: 2012-04-10 22:15:12
More attempts at distraction and still failing. 
The proof is already out there. You collected money for magazine sales and ad sales for that magazine, but have not delivered any product, only excuses and delays. That makes you a con-man/scammer. 
 
You convinced a teenage girl to dress in her panties and talk about Bitcoin and have been taking pictures and making video of it. This makes you a sexual predator since there is no appropriate reason for this to have occurred. You are the one who convinced her to do this and she is not an adult. 17 year old girls don't need your "help".
 
But that is what your type does, preys on ignorance and then tries to cover it with lies and deflection once detected. You can only keep this up for so long before it collapses (or before an angry father comes for some justice).
I only have one account here. You have now admitted to having more than one. One of your first lines of attack is to accuse people of being sock-puppets and yet here you are, guilty of the same charge. There is no doubt you have more than 2 accounts here and I wonder how many others elsewhere? 
Interesting how the con-man is slowly being revealed. There's a limit to the lies and excuses you can fabricate before people get wise.
@_date: 2012-04-10 15:24:01
Try to distract all you like, the fact remains that you are a pedo scammer.
@_date: 2012-04-10 15:10:05
Of course. Any time someone starts to call you for what you are, you call them a sock-puppet... Maybe you're just scum.
@_date: 2012-04-10 23:59:07
It's looking like the last lines for you on this. Are you getting bored, or are you worried about revealing more than you already have? 
You seem to like the "show me where I said" argument but I am not the only one who was lead to believe when things would be complete. So basically you are saying "since I never said there was an actual deadline, it is unreasonable to expect a deadline". Interesting logic or argument "skills" you claim to have.
Before you take your ball and go home I would be more than happy to agree to disagree: You are a scamming pedophile, but you disagree with the fact that you are a scamming pedophile.
(Don't worry, I wasn't really expecting you to out yourself completely here, but you did a pretty good job)
@_date: 2012-04-10 13:16:04
No doubt it was MNW who suggested what she should wear.
@_date: 2012-04-09 03:39:58
I wonder when people are going to start asking for refunds? If he's not scamming then there should be no problem with giving everyone their money back until he actually delivers.
@_date: 2012-04-10 18:49:53
No one should trust him with their money or anything else for that matter. He's a scammer, stay far away.
@_date: 2012-04-09 03:41:52
@_date: 2012-04-10 20:42:44
Yes, posts against you because you are the scammer. If no one cares about what I have to say then why do you care to respond? 
You do not succeed, you do not produce. All you are doing is scamming people and preying upon underage girls. There is nothing original about selling non-existent products or conning teenage girls. You're not even original in Bitcoin since there have already been pedophile scammers before you. You are just the latest, and hopefully the last.
