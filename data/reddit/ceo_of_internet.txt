Bc.i says it was imported, so the question how it was "generated" remains..

Understanding public key crypto and hash functions in theory should be enough to understand the bitcoin paper.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:07:09
Not yet.

It's trivial. Please see vanity-address..it's a program that generates addresses with specified first chars. It was used like this:
./vanity-address 1TEST
This command will generate the address that starts with characters "1TEST"..

bitcoin-cli getconnectioncount
123 here! I guess I'm OK :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 13:40:57
they are not. he explained it in the post.
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:57:16
actually encryption has existed for centuries..
@_date: 2015-08-31 18:24:39
i agree. it makes no sense!
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:50:22
oh this one's nice :)

Yeah you know, I try to help where I can. With the bitcoin CEO we don't know each other personally. I think I might have spotted him on reddit, but quite some time ago.

I'm also building my own. It's still in beta, but I'm planing to go live in the next few weeks:

Damn! I was wrong at the mining reward question. 93%

Bitcoin is DIY Punk, not Punk rock!
@_date: 2015-08-31 18:29:30
what if i'm running a block explorer website.. would it make sense to use the simbol instead of "BTC" string?

Does anyone have an idea what are the costs of being a core dev? Do you actually need a few servers for testing, with 200Gb storage each?
@_date: 2015-04-19 18:34:02
ah, so only if the OPs coins were not moved a lot since they were mined, it could be possible. worst case you would come up with a few possible original blocks

I agree. There's nothing new in bitcoin. Cryptography and math have existed for centuries, sha256 and proof-of-work also pre-date Satoshi. With bitcoin he basically just connected the dots.
But I do believe that there are some pretty smart people in this community. And also what bitcoin enables is that everybody can do amazing and revolutionary stuff that they couldn't done before.

Yeah, the same thing happened to me some time ago. They suck!
I was planning to contact Namecheap support and explain it to them, but I never actually did it as I was preparing for travel and the trip is still not finished, so I never found time.
But this must have been going on for quite some time. I'm sure the only reason people install their shitty wallet is they are being forced by Namecheap or some other vendor.
Hm.. If we had an army of organized trolls who could influence Namecheap, they might improve their platform and dump Bitpay. So sad we don't posses such power.
