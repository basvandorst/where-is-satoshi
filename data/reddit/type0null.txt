It is a 12 (or 24 on Electrum?) word seed (group of words) that is how you recover a wallet. Entering this phrase on a new install of Electrum on any PC will recover your funds. Without that, you will need help from someone with more knowledge on recovering lost funds.

Also frequently check your balances for whatever wallet your using. At least once a week. Just for peace of mind.

Lol, I will notify myself of my ownership of my wallet and will monitor it closely.

Probably part of this Tether situation making the rounds and I'd say a general correction. Excitement can't be turned to 11 constantly. Bad press like Bitconnect can't help either. The everyday person sees Bitconnect and thinks Bitcoin is a scam.

13.5k seemed like a good area, then if sub 10k I'm buying a little more. I've stopped trying to predict and just buy some after any major "bubble bursts." Exciting December I must say.

My mom is actually very interested in my investments and is very supportive. She thinks its great when I tell her I bought some more. Moms are funny. And their texting style is too.

The process to use is as follows:
1. Move BTC from Electrum to new wallet, with a new seed if using Electrum again.
2. On a different device install the Electron Cash wallet.
3. Your Electrum wallet should not have any BTC in it at this point, as you transferred it to new wallet. Check that it has been properly transferred.
4. In the Electron wallet, import your seed from the now empty Electrum wallet that originally held your BTC.

I will never use this wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:47:19
Is there even a good alternative for this stuff yet? This is the only wallet I've seen talked about.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:40:44
Your balance that you had at the time of the fork is how much BCH you will have. I believe that is correct.
I personally would use a separate device. It would work on the same device, but it would leave your Electrum wallet vulnerable if something malicious is in Electron Cash. I take no chances.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:34:57
Christ this is insane. Is a correction coming is 5k coming? Tonight was my night to celebrate with a6 pack and instead I'm nervous for some reason. Maybe this weekend will just be memorable, having seen Roger waters last night AND hitting 4k in the same weekend should be a good thing. Yet here I sit with a dog and a cat not knowing what to feel. Is that Joe Rogan by the way?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:12:35
Sounds like pending. If you bought with your bank account it takes up to a week. CC buys will appear shortly after buying. Most times.

Bittrex does list it, but when I went to generate a wallet address to prepare for a deposit, it says unavailable at the moment. We'll see. I don't know that I'll ditch it right away, but I can't imagine doing nothing at all with it at some point soon.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:30:17
Until it can be sold on multiple exchanges I really think it's hard to say what the true value is. Are people buying it actually or just claiming their balance?

Realistically if actual cash in hand were to go away and be replaced with cryptocurrency, the high fees would basically kill Bitcoin or make it only a store of value. No one would pay a 5% fee if there are multiple other options, especially for small, every day transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:09:30
Yes, no one can sell it, or dump as many people say. It has to be somewhat overvalued because everyone is hodling by default.

I don't mind them so much. I like the little guy.

Buy where the price is best I guess. Bank transfers take a few days unless you're using your debit card. Not sure if bittrex does debit cards, but there's usually higher fees that way. Usually coin base is highest, but right now it seems to be unusually higher than the rest.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:31:38
I do have Ethereum. You would suggest multiple?

I believe the wait is currently at a week. At least that's what my wait has been.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:10:29
Check tools section, then history. It may have been cancelled. If so, try a smaller amount. That worked for me before.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:09:19
Yes I know the feeling. I had a problem where they were insta-cancelling my purchases. I bought a low amount, then tried again for my original quantity and it worked. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:08:49
I buy a bit every week, DCA, but over the weekend when it was sub $2,000 I bought some extra. Wouldn't buy extra at 2,600.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:43:11
You should be asking yourself that question.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:25:22
Let me rephrase, I personally don't believe there's a wrong time to buy in. In the long scheme almost 3k may be low. As someone's who's been buying a bit for awhile, I try to time my buys. Buying when I see people diving in for the first time everywhere throws a red flag up for me that maybe the price will fluctuate down. Get an account set up on Coinbase or Bitstamp, even Changelly (they allow Visa card buys) and see how it is over the weekend.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:24:29
You picked a bad time to do this. Just wait.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:43:20
I believe most people would recommend localbitcoins for what you're looking for. I personally haven't had much of a problem with Coinbase and the fact that no downtime was experienced with this drop is a great sign of improvement.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:17:40
When I see posts like this, I totally feel like it's the wrong time to buy.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:12:47

Electrum is easy to use and reliable. They support both chains, should that happen.

Yea I don't know. I still haven't jumped back in yet.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:53:32
The only thing coinbase is doing is disabling buys, sells, and withdrawals temporarily on July 31. From coinbase though, you won't be able to own the proposed Bitcoin Cash. They don't support it. Your Bitcoin is unaffected and will be fine once they enable the buying and selling again.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:17:26
Yes, I find it to be safe and user friendly. Of course keep your computer safe, though.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:55:44
If I'm not mistake the syncing must complete, then the funds will appear in your wallet. That is when you will be able to access them.

Christ, let's get back to 3k first. 500k?! I'm not opposed to this but wow. That's bold.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:15:00
Well your first mistake was selling low at $2,300. Buying a little bit wouldn't hurt in the long run I'd say, but at this exact moment, I'd advise against a big buy. I could be wrong though and in an hour it's at $4,000.
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:21:28
You will be fine with Electrum. They support both chains.

It's like half down. Usually lasts an hour or so at the most, at least for me on a desktop.
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:45:14
More coins?
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:30:07
Do people really panic sell at these mild drops? If anything I panic BUY at the drops.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:46:29
My best advice is do it now. You may be waiting forever. You can always buy more if it drops. A lot more if it drops. If it's your first time buying just do it and then buy big dips, if any happen at all.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:39:43
Wouldn't be the worst thing ever.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:20:37
Hopefully low. I want more coins.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:39:41
Every Wednesday I do my weekly buy, but it's so damn high lately I almost want to wait. Clearly I won't because like someone said, at 4500, 2900 will seem cheap. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:19:59
Honestly, if you don't win in about 3 hours or less, I'd say by summer's end you got $100. Take payment in BTC though.
