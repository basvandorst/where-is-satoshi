Based on how Microsoft has acted in the past it's fair to say it's a surprise. I highly doubt Balmer would have adopted bitcoin and large companies are usually the last to adapt and be forward thinking. If anything I expected google to adopt bitcoin into google wallet before Microsoft in any way but this and some of their other decisions as of late has made my views on Microsoft as a company change which hasn't happened in quite a few years.

Perfect next we should ask them to use a license compatible with the truecrypt one instead of illegally changing it.

Your interpretation is different than mine, it is not vital that it supports segwit today... i am just fine waiting longer as they work towards their milestones.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:28:35
You are not the ultimate authority on what is and is not of the highest priority for each individual dev team, imho waiting so they can support the additional features behind the segwit update that can't be implemented today is a better use of their funds and in the grand scheme of things a couple years from now no one will care they didn't have segwit support right out the gate. This criticism is you jumping on the bandwaggon and bashing anyone that doesn't do the update to your personal standards when the timing will be arbitrary in the grand scheme of things. Give them more time, they're still one of the best teams to make wallets and have a good vision for a product that will ultimately do more good than any hypothetical harm you could argue they are doing in a reddit comment on the internet.
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:25:57
This is a totally overblown reaction, give them time? Who cares what coins it supports in the short term? Give them at least a year to build what they are trying to build before we complain about it supporting this or that coin.

I see people say this a lot who fear freedom because they want everything done for them and are willing to pay dearly for it. The concept of bitcoins forces freedom down your throat whether you like it or not. Without such forced changes in society we will never evolve as a whole.

Hmmm $5k to recover around 9-10k worth of coins. Your way sounds much safer than looking on craigs list for someone who solders as a hobby. To clarify I actually do not think the drives memory is non functioning it's just that the metal USB portion bent off. So I already know that I just need some cables soldered on it and too hook it up too usb. I just cant solder good enough to hit the small points.

I have had the craziest experience with coinbase that I've ever had in my 4 years of buying and selling bitcoins. Some good some bad love the interface but with the glitches I've experienced I can't afford to keep any coins with them at this point too risky.
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:22:26


I've been in contact with their support several times still no luck getting the last portion out. I urge anyone else thinking about using them to be cautious how many coins they keep in their. I had around 8 coins in their and it's been a pain getting them out.

No I know i don't have that many because I remember what wallets I had backed up to this drive for SAFE keeping. The bulk of my coins from my mining in 2011-2012 are somewhere else. This has like 10 maybe 13 most I just didnt bother to transfer them cause they were trading at $2.47... then a while later I moved them to the flash drive and deleted them from the hard drives and time passed and this happened lol.

This will not work as the metal connections would still need to be soldered. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:24:23
Someone from customer support gave me 0.05 BTC for my trouble and said sorry then supposedly they fixed it for me because it let me send a small amount of bitcoins so I deposited more in there and tried to send them out to buy something and they are stuck again. Support has ignored me for 6 days. Basically they're holding my money hostage and are having me test doing transactions till it works even though I'm not interested in beta testing a service I just want my bitcoins.
