my only concern with taking the pic is that someone else could easily access that pic and then use that pic against me along with the password manager being hacked as well.

First off I want to say thank you for taking the time to try to help us out! I have a few questions I'm hoping you can clarify
1) What do the tax forms look like when we input our trade history? Where can I go to look what it looks like? Curious so I know how to format my spreadsheet so when its time to fill out the form it will be a breeze.
2) What’s the best way to account for network fees? (i.e., the cost of making a transaction on the ETH network)? Should I adjust the cost basis of a lot by the USD value of the network fee at the time of the transfer? 
3) What would an audit look like and what would I have to show them? Am I doing to much buy trying to create a spreadsheet of my buy/sell history which helps me find out where the BTC or ETH came from if I ever need to trace back? (i;e if my last trade was DASH and if I ever get audit for DASH I would assume they would ask me how this trade came about and thus wouldn’t I need to show them where I got my ETH or BTC from in order to purchase DASH?) or could I just give them all my CSV of my order history from all exchanges and let them figure out? Not sure how this works. What are the best thing to do for safety measure to be ready incase you get audit? What are somethings I should have in hand to prove to them that I am innocent (guilty til innocent in the eyes of the IRS). 
4) What's the best way to keep track of your trades? Bitcoin.tax or cointracker is usually glitchy and isn't accurate at times. 
5) My CPA doesn't know squat about crypto, so I'm looking for a different CPA, would finding one online be the best choice?

What will the tax form look like when we fill out all our trades?

I’d like to know this as well

hmm, interesting. I will try it out and see if that works. I'm curious how people withdraws millions of dollars as we always hear in news. wondering what exchange they are using

I'm thinking about moving my BTC to Jaxx or Exodus and store them there

Newbie here.. can someone dumb it down and tell me what's going on? I keep hearing about "SegWit" 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:59:21
So if BIP-141/Segwit happens, it could split? I thought a chain split could happen if segwit2x happens? Sorry if thats a dumb question, still trying to learn all thats going on
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:11:45
Which side is for the split and which side doesn't want the split? 
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:52:20
So which side is Jihan Wu on? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:40:38
Ah okay. Well it looks like Segwit2x will likely happen because its around 90% now. But no hardfork for august right? If it were to happen it would be in november?
