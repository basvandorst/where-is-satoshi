I wish Gemini did that when they let you withdraw your entire BCH balance. Granted, mine was nowhere that, but still a scary amount of money to me.

Didn't know there was a place called @_date: 2017-12-08 22:21:35
The problem is those safe havens have accounts of some corporation owned by another corporation with a custodian/lawyers name on it and their clients identity concealed due to attorney client privilege. The identity of the true asset owner remains hidden.

Nah, he'd probably be homeless because he wouldn't have had a car to get to his job to pay the bills. He wouldn't have Internet access, so he'd have to figure out how to convert a paper wallet to actual money, assuming someone didn't stab him and take his piece of paper with funny indecipherable alphanumeric strings on it.

It goes perfect with the photo tbh

The US already has the most restrictive KYC/AML laws in the world, yet we have among the weakest laws concerning secrecy of corporate finances. The rich get richer, they stay in control, and they ensure no one else can reach their tier.

That was kind of my philosophy, but getting my BTCe account hacked and drained changed that. I sold a bigger chunk of my holdings to recoup what I lost on that.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:12:06
Bitcoin is like finding $20 in your coat pocket every day. You're probably not rich, but it puts you in a good mood with regards to your finances.

I prefer the instantaneous liquidity an exchange offers. A coin could lose 25% of its value in the time it takes to resync years worth of blockchain transactions that took place during cold storage.

I don't think GDAX is usable in NY. Coinbase is pretty nerfed here. We can't buy/sell Eth or LTC on it.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:46:59
Idk what to tell you, keep using coinbase, a company that charges 1.5% to buy Bitcoin and another 1.5% to sell. Wait a week for your BTC to be available, hopefully it hasn't dropped between when you locked in pricing and when it arrives. Kraken isn't available where I live. Gemini works fine. Never tried GDAX. BTC-e was a great no nonsense exchange, but they were pretty shady. A bit too Wild West for my taste.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:17:40
All my crypto is out of coinbase. Since I made an account with Gemini, there is no comparison.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:48:22
Lower fees, and it's an actual exchange, meaning instant buys, and limit orders. Coinbase buys are really slow, the market moves way quicker.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:12:00
I'd start tearing it apart and looking for a flash drive or SD card.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:17:31
Gemini fees are 0.25% coinbase is 1.5%, their limits are low, and it you lock in a buy like 10 days before you actually receive your crypto. Gemini is the best for me as far as converting USD to BTC. I used BTCe and bittrex before, both were fine as far as being an exchange (BTCe got raided by the FBI though iirc)

Still a 5 year term and requires "intent to settle in Quebec". I know even the U.S. does this sort of thing, but for people intending to live there. Malta is basically buy citizenship to get access to the rest of the EU. They don't give a shit if you ever set foot in Malta. There's no faux jobs creation bs. It's give us money and we will give you papers.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:09:31
The only ones I've heard of are Malta, Cyprus, and St Kitts. Austria has some program, but there are a lot of strings attached. They just want foreign money from Chinese and Russian capital flight.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:00:17
Isn't Malta the country where you can buy an EU citizenship without any residency? They seem quite corrupt. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:21:28
Programming and auto fellatio. Those two things aren't mutually exclusive

The bitcoin network can do 7 transactions per second. Visa can do 56000.
Transaction fees are like $20 regardless of how much you're sending.
It's not user friendly unless you're using a web based service like Coinbase, which kills any privacy Bitcoin may have had.
The mining infrastructure uses an insane amount of electricity.
Other cyrptos have solved some of these problems. Bitcoin hasn't. It's hype, speculation, and being first to the market. Even the darknets are abandoning it in favor of other currencies.
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:18:24
I understand Bitcoin holds value, the question is does it hold $4K of value? It will never be worthless because of online gambling, darknet sales and money laundering, but I can't put an actual valuation on what 1 BTC should be worth independent of market demand.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:05:15
I'm pretty sure bitcoins illegality is a big part of the demand. It's portable, difficult to trace, and difficult to seize if you hide it. I still think it's great for online gambling.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:57:15
Bitcoin is utter shit as a currency. Other cryptos do it better. Bitcoin was just first.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:34:14
So are we getting forked coins again like BCH? By what date do I need to get my coins off an exchange and into a local wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:06:40
I’ve been in crypto since like 2012-2013. I sold litecoin at $15 after a $40 ath years ago. My btce account got hacked and I lost everything I had on that exchange. Sure I made money on crypto I had elsewhere, but what about cryptsy or gox? Crypto is a total mixed bag. Beyond gambling, capital flight, and buying illegal products/services, I really don’t see why you would take all the risk a financial institution had and shift it to the end user.

Awareness is a good one too. Really? I’ve never heard of breast cancer before!
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:46:33
I've always thought BCH is bitcoin cash and BTC is bitcoin, not bitcoin core. What am I missing, other than intentionally confusing names?
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:10:33
Don't forget to pay yourself a fat administration salary for selling stuff people give you for free. Or start a mega church.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:20:02
Doge is the most legit crypto imo. At least the creator knows it’s a joke and doesn’t try to pretend otherwise.

Charities are an industrial complex. Many of them are not in the business of eradicating problems, since they require those problems to exist for them to survive. Some do a lot of good (I regularly donate to the ACLU since the government will always try to erode the rights of its citizens). But you've got some big name players like the Red Cross that managed to build 6 houses in Haiti with $500M of donations for disaster relief. You have companies like Goodwill that pay disabled people peanuts to work there and sell stuff other people gave them for free, while keeping many actual good donated products. You also have Wounded Warrior Project, and Susan G Komen, which are basically PR marketing departments of the NFL. Everyone aware of breast cancer, why don't you spend some of your money trying to cure it, or at least make it more manageable? Nah, we will just have football players wear pink, that'll make people feel good and win over more donations.

Selling drugs on the Internet doesn't seem like the worst idea. It's not the easiest thing in the world, but you can ship small packages with anonymity. Buying drugs on the Internet though, it doesn't matter how you pay, they need to get delivered to you somehow.

I had the opposite happen. My account got hacked and completely wiped out via my email getting breached. They didn't care, their response to my support ticket was too slow, they permitted transfers out to addresses I've never used and logins from a foreign IP.
