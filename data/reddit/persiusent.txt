I understand. I want to send my last few across from Coinbase to Crypto and it's half fees, so I'm waiting (unfortunately)

It wasa typo from years back, and it was a great mistake because its (almost) a great acronym. HODL... Hold On for Dear Life. You're welcome

Well I still have 0.00btc, so feel free to share the love lol

I want to, but I still have a few $ in there, but the transaction costs more than my funds in coinbase so I can't actually do anything. And I've been trying to authenticate for 8 days through GDAX with constant errors and no support replies.

30th person the post this :) sorry

Yes and no. I do sign in and it uses my licence etc, but wont let me do anything unless I add another form of ID. I've been trying to do that for 8 days. Haven't even been able to do that for the last 2 days because I keep getting page errors. The whole thing is a joke.
This is also my first ever go into Bitcoin and I only started a few weeks ago. So I'm basically back to nothing because 1, I can't do anything with coinbase, and the mining I was doing was through Nicehash, so I lost that too. Not having much luck getting into Bitcoin.

As a guy with a young family who has just lost his job before Christmas, feel free to find a way to hide one in Australia for me to find :)
