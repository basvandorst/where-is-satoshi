Given that iExec announced the integration into RSK just a few hours ago, I'm not sure what you have been seeing before .. but maybe you should read the article.

Nope, basically I'm saying ( in terms of computational power) :
    ETH &lt; RSK + iExec ≈ ETH + iExec

That should totally be a thing!
It would probably cost more computing power to mine a btc block than the total marketcap of bitcoin and take longer than the heat death of the universe, but still. 
We need satoshi to come forward to say that this was his real vision for bitcoin.

Eth *alone* can't do this, as its smart contracts (similar to RSK) only have very limited computational power.
iExec is a decentralized cloud computing platform which you can use on ethereum and now also on RSK/BTC to give your smart contracts unlimited computing power.

Yup, one problem right now is that these contracts only have very low processing power. The partnership between iexec and RSK means that smart contracts can now have unlimited processing power. You could execute an AI on a decentralized network using bitcoin to pay for its services, e.g. beat someone at Go. Basically unlimited possibilities.

Much more than ETH actually, offchain computing lets you integrate any program into a smart contract. You can make the contract mine blocks in minecraft, if you pay it. Not sure why you'd want to do that, but its possible.

He needed the money to invest in a promising new idea called bitconnect.

-&gt; having bitcoin in the username
-&gt; thinking someone actually wants to buy 160M on bitfinex
-&gt; thinking you can't short on bitfinex
Retard alert!!!
