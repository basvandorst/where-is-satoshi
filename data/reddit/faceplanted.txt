Yeah, one iPhone is worth like, ~~several ounces~~ 4 grams of blow.

Dude, you need to get your drunken hack-a-thon and archery contests on.

Head along to a club, it's fun and easy to start, it only gets really expensive once you choose to start putting money into it, and leave the compound bows alone, they're just cheating.

I would say I have all the nerdiest friends and take a course with generally straight edge people.

It is fun, I can shoot around 350 on a Portsmouth round (20 ends, or 60 arrows).
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:26:38
so, like 4 grams at a good price, depending on the model.
I should really learn my drug prices.

but can you get your potassium intake from an iPhone?

Dude... joke.

I go to university in ""The safest city in the united Kingom"", doubles quotes for sarcastic emphasis, which might have something to do with it.

As a young middle class white student, I've rarely had to deal with either rich *or* poor people drugs.

Some are drunk, some are straight edge, both go to the events.

What the fuck does the market cap matter to them? If accepting this coin gets more people to give them the $2 a month pro costs than were doing it before, it's worth it, especially considering is one of the biggest communities around a cryptocurrency that isn't bitcoin there is and they all know of and use imgur.
All of these companies that accept cryptocurrencies don't keep the money in that form, they almost immediately convert to USD because it's more stable.

The hack-a-thon is the drunk part, the archery is sober, I did once go to an archery contest in France where the french people brought out Rosé half way through and drank a good amount of it.

The problem in my mind is that Bitcoin is an unstable currency with a secure payment system attached and visa versa, and some people are trying to invest in a currency not understanding that it requires people to use it's payment system to actually thrive, and some people are buying into an e-commerce payment system without grasping that they have to contain some of the money in an unstable alternative currency to do so. Which, as you might expect, has lead to some problems.

Yes, you were comically wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:00:16
You sir, are a gentleman and a scholar.

You've done some really cool shit with what you have and made *a lot* of people's days, you did enough, sorry about the crash.
