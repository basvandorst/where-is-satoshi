Great idea, gets those interested parties sitting on the fence started with a bit, and then addicted like the rest of us.

It actually also bothers me that they attribute the post and a quote to you incorrectly. The thread was created by NastyMan9.
This is of course above and beyond how much of a l33t hax0r and a devil-worshipping theif you obviously are.

I have a friend, whose coworker told people he had xxx BTC. My friend was talking to me about it and said he wanted to give the coworker his BTC address. 
All I could say was dude, no. Think of how many people will be begging him for money. Be a good friend and don't give any addresses to him unless he asks.
It's the same thing with lottery winners - their friends and family come out of the woodwork looking for 'loans' and then they disappear.

What the shit, dude. You *had* money to live off of. You wasted away your half. Give her the half she deserves, or rather, what is left. You've overspent your half already. As far as I'm concerned, you owe her more than the $280k. 
You're literally ignoring your parents dying wish - how disrespectful is that? How would you feel if she had been in charge of divvying up the inheritance and it had disappeared instead of you receiving your half.
