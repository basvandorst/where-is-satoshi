Entire markets have been artificially pumped and now we're seeing the actual valuation. So much money was thrown at white papers and speculation without a real world solution. Also the futures played into this too

Yes. Works fine. Not a single issue I day trade on the app and the design I nice 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:28:47
Don't buy b cash. As an entry level Bitcoiner maybe start with coin base to buy BTC. Download the app, start buying the amount you desire and watch your profits grow. I buy with my debit card on coinbase all the time. Best of luck and never invest anything you can't afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:18:59

@_date: 2018-01-07 15:28:23
BTC will be the Myspace of crypto. I love it but I can't see it breaking 25k max. The fees are high, takes long for transactions etc. While im only hodling 1.2 BTC, I plan to exit when it hits 20k. Take some profits and diversify into other coins. I know I will get downvotes but that's my exit strategy for BTC. 20k and I'm out. That's my moon. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:26:34

It's gonna hit 7k this year but then will bounce back for an ATH....

It's actually very useful. If you don't wanna lose a ton of money during times like this sell into Tether and at least you know tether won't drop below a dollar 
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:00:07
Have you people not learned yet? Stop sending huge ass wires to these unregulated exchanges. Break that ish up man. I move 50k max at a time. Never wire that much money in one shot. I'd rather eat the extra small fee over putting 180k in krakens hands. That place is scammy 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:36:15
I stopped reading this list when it gave doge a C. We all know doge deserves an A this list is bogus

@_date: 2018-01-31 16:04:14
It’s hideous lol
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:44:39
HODL for a year. Come back and enjoy so much happiness. But yeah, it's never a good idea to go full retard. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:35:20
A shop in China Town is selling them for 3 bucks a piece. Thought it was a cool conversation piece 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:30:37
Nothing is certain in crypto. Nothing can really be predicted to an extent. Just buy some coins and HODL. Always have your exit strategy. For example I have a portfolio with a ton of alt coins but I also hold BTC. My exit strategy is when we get back to 18k. I'm pulling out of BTC and holding on to my other coins. Just know when you want to get out. Never buy ATHs, buy the red not green lol. I think we will see a low for BTC some where between 7-8K but I also think BTC will break the last ATH this year too. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:12:43
Crypto Nick and Trevon James are creating their own lending platform I can't wait to throw my money at the ICO

In the short term we all make money, in the long term this shit is all going to come crashing down big time. I dont have much now, but im sitting on a few BTC. My moon is 25k per coin and im out. I don't wanna be around when you all either become millionaires or lose everything lol

CB sucks crypto exchanges have serious liquidity issues. Drives me nuts 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:38:58
BTC is just a store of value for the wealthy right now, it's a very shitty currency. I'm hodling one last time until it hits 18k again. I think in 2018 it's gonna hit another ATH, then plummet. Either way I plan on taking some profits and then going all in on LTC and few other cryptos...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:15:32
BTC is King but never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify yo bonds
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:11:23
Fuck that bank, walk in there with your crypto swag on and close your account. Then make paper BTC wallets for all the employees with only a dollar on there
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:52

South Korea is trying to shut down exchanges as they announced they're going to crack down on trading. Also, it's end of year, many took profits but expect thing to bounce back up for 2018. I did tell myself when BTC breaks 18k again, I'm out...
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:58:49
BTC will be the Myspace of crypto. But that's ok, cause I have a good exit strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:31
Be very careful with coinomi. Many users have complained of missing coins or transactions that never go through. Check all the reviews in the store
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:28:23
BTC is not a currency it's a store of value. It blows as a currency, but I need it to go higher so I can sell it back for some good ole Fiat. Mass adoption is going to be complicated. This whole space is just so fragmented, reminds me of android phones. So many different phones, still running different skinned versions etc. 1000 wallets lol it's a cluster 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:50:25
BTC already sucks as a currency so I can't see how much worse it could get. Either way HODL and free the internet!! We don't want internet fast and slow lanes. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:32:22
Nah, get a ledger nano s. I have both and i still like my nano s better. I agree with most here, if you have over lets say, 10k then keep on hardware wallet. If you have a few hundred i wouldnt worry about it
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:11:01
Well it's right under 13k a coin so you picked goodtime. I would have bought half a BTC and diversified the rest among other coins personally but welcome to the club
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:48:22
Nah, LTC is on a mission. If LTC dips back down I'll sell more of my BTC holdings and buy more LTC. I need them both to the moon!!!

Don't mine unless you plan on dumping a shit ton of money into a legit mining farm lol. Especially don't mine on your main rig
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:44:31
First of all, I keep my BTC on hardware wallet and I'm certain IRS doesn't know how many BTC I currently hold. If I'm not mistaken if your cryptos are sitting on an exchange and hold a value more than 20k, then coin base or etc has to hand over the records if it's US based. The second I try and cash out I know uncle sam will have his hand out lol. Not getting my money tho. If I had all my money on exchanges, I'd move it all to hardware and I'd tell them I lost it and count it as a loss. That's assuming if they already knew how much money I had. Fuck the IRS
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:03:46
