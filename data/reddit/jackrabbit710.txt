Waiting for people to start taking profits after being stagnant for a while
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:48:53
Can someone clear up as to what this means?
I've got a rough idea! What impact could it have? Double transactions?
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:29:16
Exactly what I'm waiting for. Going to increase my bitcoin investment alongside my litecoins
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:03:10
Fellow jazz pianist here! Doing the same for litecoin. Great to see your services offered for bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:13:33
I have been given 3 tips so far! Now can I tip outside of reddit? Like Facebook? 
@_date: 2014-08-16 13:18:38
It is a bit slow for everyday transactions. I swapped some BTC for some tickets I won recently, and it took round 11 mins to come through. I suppose paying in small amounts you don't really need to wait for it to confirm though
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:53:35
I'm at a similar investment level but far less in value!
I have a lot of faith in litecoin at the moment, the price has levelled out and seems to be solid.
The community are working on a number of things at the moment, check out this sticky

And if I remember correctly, you are also a student of Dave frank!
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:18:14
As a BTC and LTC holder, I don't see the joke?
@_date: 2014-05-17 08:31:47
Novice!! I've been doing this for a couple of months now!!
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:04:03
I've just bet on England to win the World Cup!
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:55:42
Ok thanks, what would stop bitcoin having a 50 attack compared to other alts though?
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:54:36
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:58:15
No one knows! But with everything that has gone on with gox, it seems to be slowly moving in the right direction again. 
Things can only get better?!
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:59:37
Downgraded ;)
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:20:32
Right after the litecoin community raise hundreds of ltc for an orphanage in Vietnam. How ungrateful
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:24:59
Yes, couldn't wish for a better mentor!
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:00:39
Why thanks! Will do, I'll get a wallet opened soon
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:30:48
I bought Bitcoin because of litecoin!
Granted I have sold my Bitcoin, and I'm waiting to see where it bottoms to buy in again.
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:41:58
Just checked out the comments. People are guessing what crypto is about! They clearly haven't been shown, or have been told a pack of lies by a bitcoin basher
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:57:58
I'm only invested into litecoin, but I'm thinking of going 50/50 bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-03-31 01:16:09
100% in a day so far
@_date: 2017-01-31 03:09:33
Just converted some BTC to LTC, interested to see what happens 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:09:03
I can see a crash post fork, which in turn will garner a load more investors wanting to get in
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:25:11
People will start taking profits soon, and when it happens, get ready
@_date: 2017-04-26 03:10:01
It still isn't too late, I'm guessing a couple of hours before segwit activates 
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:43:23
With all its ups and downs, it's done it!
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:09:15
LTC is around 5% away from signalling 
@_date: 2017-04-26 00:35:37
Looking good for segwit!! 
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:09:14
Hopefully they took some profits though?
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:07:37
If you double your investment, it’s seen as a good trade.. problem is, everyone gets greedy
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:05:06
Possibly further then it will stay stagnant for a long while
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:14:34
Until we see it in shops everywhere, we can't say it has!
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:32:05
I was right though, did take a bit of a dive 
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:04:40
Just looking at the charts yeah, expecting something to happen soon
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:35:06
at this very moment, its less useless than bitcoin thats for sure! Hopefully it can show bitcoin its full uses
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:48:16
They are a bit slow in the customer service dept, but I'm sure it will get resolved. They are genuine 
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:01:56
Only a couple of days until SEGWIT gets activated now 
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:17:39
Nope it got locked in for activation
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:26:21
*aside from Litecoin :)
