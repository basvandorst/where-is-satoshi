Only in (okay, and would Bitcoin + gold count as diversification.  That's like buying SPX and RUT and thinking you're properly hedged.

Lol no. C is for Calico, their longevity subsidiary.

Almost all bitcoin threads outside of get this response.  There's a real disconnect between what thinks of itself and how everyone else sees it.

It's all lazy, self serving simplification.  How would you react if you read this
    Pro-life - We save babies 
    Pro-abortion - We kill babies
on Would you take it seriously? Show some respect by not assuming you have all the answers.

Lol, CNN is quicker to report on bitcoin than this subreddit.  You just saw a 40% flash crash and the only approved post is about Humble Bundle.

I don't know any businesses (well, besides Overstock) that wants to be associated with frothy nouveau Goldbugs.  If Bitcoin was apolitical you'd see a lot less resistance.

LOL, between 10:1 and 100:1 odds on bitcoin replacing currency, gold, and bonds.  I think it might be a tad less than that.

I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2012, am heavily invested, and would like to give back to the community.  Thanks for your consideration.
