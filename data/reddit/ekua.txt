I completely agree with you. Although I am watching this critically, I am a part of it to some extend. I like the philosophy behind it. Power to the people and such. But crowds can get pretty irrational sometimes :)

Banks threaten Europe’s financial stability. And their lobby. We just want sound money that doesn’t loose value due the banks exploiting us all.

Or... al those people wanted to get in due to fomo while prices were rising. Now they are waiting, seeing the declines and loose interest?
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:57:03
You think? I think they DO have some value. I'm just wondering whether they are overvalued right now.

American interest rates go up. Europe follows. The stock market crashes. Money flushed into gold and crypto. Crypto could go two ways now. People trust it enough to flourish and have it part in a new monetary system. Or people distrust it, crypto crashes, a new monetary system is created. Maybe with gold being part of it, or the renminbi, or some world bank sdr?

Then buy back and hold. This thing is just starting.

I saw a documentary a while ago showing golden coins and US dollars. Toddlers picked golden coins as true value. Economy professors picked US dollar bills. This is somewhat similar I guess.

And they would allow people to charge their phones or laptops for free? And there would be enough plugs for all passengers to charge their equipment? And would you walk around in those countries with your phone or laptop?
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:20:55
I see. I'm mistaking stocks with ETFs which I'm holding.
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:42:13
Do mind I'm not giving you a sell advise. Don't sell all of it! No one knows whether we're in a Bull market, a transfer of wealth to Bitcoin or whether we are in a bubble. It would be frustrating to find out Bitcoin price will not reach lows as of today no more. If it DOES go way lower, you might find a nice price to get in again. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:23:57
Central Banks all over the world are printing currency not backed by anything. So, no, I'm not talking about the US. I'm talking global.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:29:22
I just love this coin! 
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:02:58
Can you use those "greed arguments" for something new like Bitcoin? Maybe you're right and we shouldn't worry too much. I'm just telling those who cannot afford losses to stay vigilant. Nothing more. I'm not telling you to dump your coins. now THAT would be risky. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:07:38
You tell me. It's off topic.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:12:08
If you need your fiat short term, you might want it to stay that way. The rest should be put in the above in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:47:45
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:14:32
In hindsight everything looks great or stupid.
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:54:47
Some cannot afford that. I wasn't warning your rich bum ;)
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:25:34
Also true. But you should remain close to being rational. Not too emotional. But emotion is human. Thank god we're not robots. Yet.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:43:49
LOL! I will still be happy that I shifted my portfolio, but still own Bitcoin. Now, you post this if Bitcoin crashes and it will take years to get up again like last time, ok?
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:48:54
The feeling you are sensing is normal. No one wants to lose. No one wants to miss out. If you use this Bitcoin and use your other money for other assets to balance things out, you might become very happy in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:14:59
Not so much. The stock market will help the patient to slow the decreasing value of their wealth denominated in fiat currency compared to the sleeping savers. Bitcoin has the potential to help the patient to remain or increase their wealth. But what if, for example, gold will return to be the store of value in our monetary system if governments decide this? Or what if Bitcoin will be replaced by a new WorldCoin? What if Bitcoin will be banned? I'm just saying that there are so many potential scenarios out there in the future. Put some of your eggs in Bitcoin, but don't trust it to be the one and only truth out there.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:05:23
It probably has to do with the fact that I distrust the dollar as a reserve fiat currency, the printing of it, and therefore any currency, and my believe that stocks are currently overvalued. Nevertheless, most of I am saying has some truth in it. Just because I do not get your argument doesn't mean my warning is of no use. And in the end, that was my point. Not knowledge about ETFs. That is kind of off topic. :)
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:11:14
In THAT case I would rather hold onto it. You have nothing to loose. And in the long term Bitcoin might reach heights unheard of. If it won't, you just smile and sigh, knowing you haven't lost a penny.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:01:21
That's the sense I'm getting.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:32:07
:) You are exactly in the mental state I'm warning people about. Don't you feel certain and good? Are you maybe bragging about your investment and how much you made? Dopamine is great isn't it? 
You misinterpreted my message. I'm not telling this is a moment to sell. I'm warning people to stay vigilant.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:32:27
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:59:32
Now that I agree on. But then again, Bitcoin is a new asset unlike gold or whatever. We must stay vigilant. Patient, but vigilant.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:46:32
True, stocks are better than just currency. Do you own stocks denominated in gold or Bitcoins? If you do, let me know more about it :)
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:21:25
This is not true and not beneficiary for this thread at all besides I must admit I had to laugh when I read it.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:20:06
Cheers! We all are in for growth or at least keeping our wealth aren't we?
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:20:40
Exactly! Decide where to put portions of your total wealth. For example some in stocks (unfortunately currently denominated in fiat currency so will be useless one day), some in a savings account (fiat will be useless one day), some in gold (has been a store of value over ages but is old fashioned), some in crypto (has great potential but fairly new and a lot of uncertainties). 
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:05:15
If you put on big boy pants first. Being offended by misinterpreting my message about vigilance is not so adult.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:06:09
I used this quote to get people's attention to warn about the dangers of human psychology. Not to say that Buffet is a genius. It is an important quote though. Many times in history people saw value in things that turned out to become worthless. Now, that's not a problem if you spread your chances and I totally agree to put a certain amount of your wealth in crypto. I'm just sending a warning to people to stay sane from the country where tulip mania lead to huge loss of wealth. Just like our believe in technology or the dollar might lead to this. Spread your options, be patient, and especially enjoy your life.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:59:33
Do NOT sell all Bitcoins you own. If you think this is a bubble, sell some, if you think this is the start of the new money HOLD them.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:53:39
Warning people to remain sane and to be sure what they're doing. Its not a sell advise. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:04:27
In the case of a power out. How do you pay for an airplane ticket? Would gold coins be better then?
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:13:29
I agree, though American stocks seem to grow less quickly lately. And altcoins are gaining lots of attention.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:56:14
Bitcoin banking standard would be great, but will governments allow bitcoin to be gold plus in the face of a new monetary system, or will they keep Bitcoin out or ban it because they can't control it. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:02:45
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:48:32
That's just an assumption. I highly distrust market prophets.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:18:50
Currency is dead. The dollar as a reserve currency, and the other ones as a result. I agree that other assets will remain valuable.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:09:22
It's dopamine. Success in any way or matter triggers it. It's wonderful!
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:05:38
You exactly point to my worries. Maybe there is no real solution. Now, I'm not an economist, just very interested in things like these. You are right about gold. Although it's good to own some, I'm afraid that gold is manipulated indirectly, just like fiat and maybe even crypto. So I'm telling people to spread their wealth over all of these assets. 
By the way, I'm not saying this is a bubble. Bubbles can't be predicted and it might as well not be. I'm saying that there might be a correction. I'm saying there is a possibility we're in a bubble because people always try to find profit in different markets and a lot of money went into crypto recently. Even large investors are looking for profit here. Or is it trust that Bitcoin will be the main currency?
I guess I'm just warning folks, not here for the best investment advise. Would be an interesting topic though. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:22:20
Read my post, not my comments. I want people to stay vigilant. I'm not here to give investment advice. I mainly know what I'm talking about but I'm not an economist. I'm sure you don't know it all either so give me a break. And what's up with remaining polite people. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:45:09
Good for you. Nothing wrong with that. Just make sure it's not the only thing you're betting on. What if Bitcoin was the prequel of something better to come? Or something worse but forced upon by government? Just like you, holding Bitcoin feels good to me. But I'm not blind to the possibility that it just might not be the next thing.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:57:06
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:18:05
Don't worry about me. I got in good and cheap ;) I'm just telling people to stay vigilant.

Tell that to the home buyers in the US a few years ago. They supposedly could afford their house. They aren't going home no more.
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:49:57
Truth is, no one knows. But if you believe in the potential of Bitcoin, it's always a good time to buy. Rather buy small amounts each month for example instead of trying to buy a dip.
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:43:20
No one is greedy? You must be a day trader. If not, do pay attention to your surroundings.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:35:11
I don't know a lot of people who really use it as a currency. Practically no one pays stuff with Bitcoin. Everyone's buying and holding or panic selling. If I would show a vendor a golden coin or Bitcoin in a crisis situation, I wonder what he would accept. I hope Bitcoin, but I have doubts about whether people truly see value in it when things get bad.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:04:44
That would be fantastic!
