Unfortunately, I really don't know. The most recent big secret plan to which I was privy is the international launch that went up this week.
You can get an idea of Coinbase's growth at  . I think they're likely doing quite well.
I'd love more transparency too, but then again I'm perhaps not the most subtle person in the world.
Sorry to not be able to give you better answers! All this stuff is kept pretty internal to Coinbase's headquarters staff.
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:27:37
I think most people at Coinbase keep up with innovation in cryptos. I mean, the staff is largely Bitcoin nerds. On the customer support internal chat room we certainly talked a lot about what's going on the in the cryptocoin world. How exactly it was manifest in the day-to-day at Headquarters, though, I'm not sure.
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:21:17
That would be great! Even if it doesn't work out, after spending so much time doing remote e-mail support it's nice to meet people face-to-face.
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:25:55
The job paid hourly, and it got to the point where I was focusing too much on other stuff to put in worthwhile hours.
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:05:07
Mostly Coinbase. If someone's calling a bitcoin service a "scam", I take it with a grain of salt. It seems that usually means one of a few things:
* They sent bitcoin to the wrong address and the company wouldn't reimburse them
* They overdrew their bank account when buying bitcoins and the company wouldn't reimburse them the overdraft fees
* They didn't protect their password properly and so someone hacked into their account
* They bought bitcoins shortly before the price went down, and the company wouldn't let them cancel the order
* Especially in the case of Coinbase, they were flagged as being "high risk" and had transactions canceled, probably as a result of having a declined bank transaction or having multiple accounts or accessing their account from a library computer or something
I'm biased because I've never had any of those problems with any site. If I'd been on the butt-end of one of those high-risk situations, I might feel differently. But as it stands, I think 9 times out of 10 the "scamming" is a result of the user's own negligence or ignorance, or is a deliberate action on the company's part that's justifiable for security reasons.
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:26:57
Coinbase is based in San Francisco and as part of keeping their culture tight they generally want to keep their full-time employees in-house. I'm pretty firmly planted in Washington DC: my fiancée is a teacher here and wants to get 5 years under her belt in one school before moving somewhere else, which I respect.
At this point in my life it's really important to me to feel like I'm actively involved in a company's culture, and being a contractor 3000 miles away feels a bit peripheral after a while.
Long story short, I left because there wasn't much room for me to advance. I don't fault Coinbase for that at all.
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:11:51
I own a whopping .028 BTC at the moment. There's not really anything I want to buy and it's too little to do much with anyway, so I'll probably let it collect dust. Beyond that, I'll probably take more of a lurking role and just keep an eye on things to see how they develop.
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:59:32
It was kind of eye-opening in some ways. I remember one guy calling me, "Robin, my dear girl," and being really condescending.
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:19:42
"Robin" is just the nickname my parents gave me, probably because there are rather a lot of Roberts in my family. I think it makes customer support more interesting... People tend to assume I'm a 30-something-year-old woman.
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:41:05
Oh, man. By this point, I'm really biased towards Coinbase. They were my first Bitcoin wallet and hired me only about a month after I set it up, so I haven't had a need to experiment much with other platforms.
I did try Bitcoin-QT for a little while, but got impatient with the syncing. Blockchain is neat, though — I really like their API.
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:49:31
I think calling something the Paypal of anything can mean very different things for different people. In the sense that Paypal tries to make it easy to send money over the Internet, and provides payment buttons and shopping carts you can quickly integrate into your website, yes, I think Coinbase is very much on that track.
I actually asked one of the higher-ups at Coinbase how they compare themselves to Paypal... I think it was Fred. If I remember correctly, the answer was basically that they try not to compare themselves since Coinbase doesn't want to be pigeonholed into staying in someone else's shadow.
As for Bitcoin, I think cryptocoins have set a really important precedent. I don't know whether Bitcoin itself will last forever, or will get superceded by an altcoin (not likely) or regulated into disuse (somewhat more likely). But I think at the very least the concept and underlying technology will have (and are already having) huge ramifications. To my mind, this is the biggest innovation in finance in decades.
@_date: 2014-09-12 12:59:58
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:10:14
That'd be my guess... I have an Android and so haven't used the iPhone app, but I do know that Coinbase's app was banned by Apple along with the rest of the Bitcoin apps. That means it hasn't been developed since then. It must run through the API, and Coinbase increased its API security considerably a couple months ago.
That aside, Coinbase still must use cookies and/or session variables or something, and those are vulnerable. Wasn't there a Dogecoin ticker extension for Chrome that was secretly phishing people's cookies?
I think Coinbase could handle situations like this more tactfully, but I think there are also two sides to the story.
@_date: 2014-05-26 00:55:06
Are you using Firefox by any chance? Coinbase seems to have had some browser compatibility issues recently.

I don't know for certain who Coinbase uses, but corporate banking is a pretty different ball game from personal banking. For what it's worth, I use Citibank and haven't had any problems there.
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:05:02
I don't know much about their hiring needs beyond what's at  I'm afraid, but it certainly couldn't hurt to get in touch.
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:26:21
I have nooo idea. Every so often someone would post on something like, "Hey, let's send Coinbase a deluge of e-mails so they'll accept Dogecoin!" My response was always that the quickest route to getting Coinbase to accept altcoins is to encourage merchants to accept them. Coinbase has its hands pretty full just dealing with Bitcoin, so it's only going to move into altcoins if it makes good business sense.
Of course, that's a bit of a catch-22: a great way to get merchants to accept altcoins would be to get Coinbase to accept them first.
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:48:05
I'm afraid I don't know. Sorry... To be honest, I was expecting more questions about Coinbase's user experience, account operations, what goes on with the customer support team, and so on. I guess that was a little shortsighted of me.
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:02:01
Hi there! None of these look particularly awkward. :P
Africa's a big continent, and so I'd be hard-pressed to say whether African merchants want to accept BTC. Based on my own experience in South Africa, I think computer literacy is going to have to be taken care of first. I imagine it's a different story in, say, Nigeria. I think Bitcoin could be a great thing for emerging economies. As it stands you have lots of migrant workers having to wire money home and paying huge portions of their paychecks just in fees. Bitcoin would allow them to circumvent all that — you can send all your money in an instant just by, say, sending your private key in a text somewhere (not that that would be very secure).
I'm unfortunately not too well-versed on current events in Bitcoin outside of Coinbase news. This is the first I've heard of Zim making Bitcoin a national currency... Is that really true? It would be awesome to see how that would turn out! Their exchange rate is like a gazillion to the USD, so I don't see what they have to lose.
Oh, man. Gauging whether or not someone will accept BTC is a hard thing to do. There are still so many misunderstandings about it. I think it would really behoove the Bitcoin community to come up with a good one-pager that explains in simple terms why a business would want to accept Bitcoin — "be your own bank" and "revolutionary currency" aren't exactly the best way to convince someone who's interested only in their bottom line. In other words, I think it could be a good thing to figure out how to pitch Bitcoin as just another boring payment system that happens to be cheaper than the other existing boring payment systems.

@_date: 2014-06-11 07:38:27
I thought I'd seen your name before in connection with CB on here and so glanced at your Reddit history... Dang, dude, you really don't like Coinbase. What started all this?
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:23:42
You could try localbitcoins.com, which is kind of like the Craigslist of Bitcoin. But it's worth noting that by not using an exchange you're putting yourself at increased risk of getting scammed unless you REALLY know what you're doing.
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:31:19
I'm glad it's been helpful! 
Up until now Coinbase has preferred having their support folks be remote. However, they just got a new director of customer support and he may have a different vision, so it's hard to say.
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:02:24
Woo! Fingers crossed!
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:19:20
True, but it doesn't smell as wonderful.
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:54:27
Coinbase gives you a choice of two ways to verify your bank account: CDV ("Check Digit Verification") and IAV ("Instant Account Verification"). Looks like you're talking about IAV, where you enter the login information for your online banking account, and they verify it by logging into your account. Should be a one-time thing. Lots of other sites do this. Mint.com and PayPal come to mind.
CDV is good for the more security-minded. Coinbase makes two tiny deposits to your bank account and you tell them the amounts of the deposits once they arrive. No passwords or anything else but your account and routing number. Only downside is it takes 2-ish days for the deposits to show up in your bank account, usually.
I'd suggest making sure to really explore a site before throwing it under the bus. No idea where you read about Coinbase being hacked. If it was the e-mail address thing, that wasn't really even a hack (although Coinbase could have addressed it better). I've been using them for over half a year without a single problem.
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:23:18
How does Coinbase not consider transactions that it can't profit handsomely from? I've placed like $5 orders with no problem...
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:20:05
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:01:32
Actually, us customer service folks weren't given a choice — or at least I wasn't. I believe the reasoning there is it gave them an easy way to pay people around the world and facilitate having a support team that covers all time zones.
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:12:43
Yeah, that'll show 'em.
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:25:26
I mean, you didn't really give them a lot to respond to. You sent them an angry rant and basically ended with with "I never want to hear from you again. Period." I'm not sure what you were expecting...?
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:27:32
Sounds like you two have a history.
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:59:15
Yep, I got paid in BTC, but usually converted it to USD fairly quickly. And I have 0.028, not 0.28 — I ain't no moneybags. :)
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:29:05
Agreed. I think "houseless" would be a much more appropriate term.

Right back at you. :)

I was wondering how long it would take one of you to comment. :) They're onto me!

I really like doing tactile things with my hands. Recently I got access to a laser cutter in Arlington, and came up with these [laser-cut business-cards-slash-wallet-pens]( I'm going to try to make a few bucks off of that. The overhead's small, so if that doesn't pan out, I'll look for something else.
If you know of anyone in the DC area who's looking for a tech and customer support wonk, please let me know. :)
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:27:31
That's a really big question! Can you give me something to focus on?
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:05:53
Dude, Olaf is like the nicest guy on the planet — second only perhaps to Mick, who's the new customer support manager.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:29:31
My understanding is Coinbase had like 2 customer service people and as a result abysmal response time up until the start of the year. Then they hired a lot of people. Seems like complaints have gone down a considerable amount since then.
Looks like the most recent update on that site is from January. I like this section from it:






@_date: 2014-09-12 13:02:10
It can't hurt to ask! I think as a rule it's better to over-apply than to under-apply, as long as you're not running yourself too ragged doing so.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:42:15
Huh. Coinbase was down for a minute or two there, but now it's working again.
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:44:18
Honestly, there really weren't many. I'm hard-pressed to think of any. Any difficulties I had were personal: feeling burned out, or frustrated that I couldn't be at headquarters.
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:56:50
Honestly, I can't speak very much to that... My focus was much more on everyday account issues and merchant/API stuff. Coinbase keeps pretty hush-hush about legal things, even internally. However, I would assume that since Coinbase is one of the big players in what's essentially a totally new industry (that's apparently quite scary to some), they're under a lot of scrutiny and as such are trying hard to cover their butts.
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:33:32
Yeah, no whistleblowing here. My motivation for doing the AMA is that every so often there's a post on here to the effect that Coinbase is "The Man". I think it's a good company, and my big "thing" in customer support is corporate approachability — that is, un-manning the company a bit. An AMA's a good way to do that, but not something that I think any current Coinbase employees are likely to do since it's a little beyond normal professional boundaries. Plus, I'm hoping that people will ask a lot of questions that give me an opportunity to reflect on the experience.
Pardon my ignorance... what's an AMY?
And yeah, we (or rather, they) get a lot of e-mails from people asking why there isn't a phone support system. Anyone who's done phone support knows that it's a *huge* energy drain, whereas with e-mail you can multitask without being rude, pull other people onto the case and provide them with a written record of everything right away, yadda yadda. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:20:23
I don't mind at all! I have a lot of respect for and knowledge about Bitcoin, but wouldn't necessarily consider myself a Bitcoin "fanboy" — so there's that. Perhaps more importantly, what with looking forward to getting married and starting a family, I'm feeling a bit pinched for money and as such not super-willing to invest what I have in anything riskier than a high-yield savings account. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:59:22
The work was basically just problem-solving and figuring out how to get grumpy people what they need in order to not be grumpy anymore — both things I really enjoy. Generally I'd answer Coinbase e-mails for a while, then muck around on Reddit for a bit, then go back to Coinbase. I worked the live chat for a while, but went back to e-mails eventually because it was hard for me to multitask. Some days I'd do 10 hours, other days I'd be taking care of other things and put in only one. It usually worked out to 20-30 hours per week.
The nice thing was that there was lots of freedom to take on other projects. For example, I noticed some of the API documentation was outdated and spent a chunk of time revising it. As long as I was doing stuff to help move the company forward, it counted as work.
Some of the customers were extremely friendly, some were extremely unfriendly (I got called a "mentally-impaired chicken" once), and most were middle-of-the-road. The diversity of Coinbase's users is pretty remarkable.
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:44:37
That's what I used to use, but couldn't figure out how to get a specific date and time without having to waggle my mouse all over the place.
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:40:55
That sounds absolutely accurate to me. Thanks for contributing that!
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:59:17
I'm working on these things for right now:  . It would be reeeally nice if that turned into something.
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:15:02
I'm surprised it's taken this long for someone to ask! The infamous "fraud-detection algorithm" is, of course, very secret. I don't even know specifically who within Coinbase understands how it works. But many of the things that can lead to you looking suspicious are things that you'd expect. The crappy thing about how Coinbase handles fraud is that once you've gotten a flag on your account it can be extremely difficult to remove the flag, as you seem to have experienced. Your best bet's to e-mail Coinbase's support and if you can think of anything that may be counting against you — having multiple Coinbase accounts or a reversed Bitcoin purchase or something — to address that upfront and see if they can do anything about it.
The whole fraud thing is easily one of Coinbase's biggest source of complaints, and it's the thing about which people are most vocal. It seems like every week someone comes on here to say that Coinbase always cancels Bitcoin purchases when the price is going up, which I'm pretty sure would be insider trading or something else illegal.
From what I've seen, Coinbase cancels orders at pretty much the same rate all the time. The thing is that when the price is going up more people want to buy Bitcoin, and so as the volume of orders increases so does the volume of canceled orders in proportion.
But yeah, the fraud thing's a pain. Kind of a necessary pain for Coinbase since they get a lot of scamming attempts (most of them directed at the poor customer support people), but it doesn't make for a fantastic user experience. Hopefully they'll keep adding methods of personal verification or something that can grease the wheels when situations like yours pop up.
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:28:44
This made me think. One of my big frustrations with companies these days is that they invest so much energy and money in trying to look big and professional, when I think businesses with which I associate a human face are much more compelling. I really appreciate seeing businesses break the fourth wall, particularly on Reddit for which there really isn't a good substitute when it comes to public discussion. From a customer support standpoint I saw a lot of people seeming to think Coinbase is "The Man", which I don't think is the case. This is a way of trying to mitigate that image a bit for a company about which I care a good deal.
I was expecting more customer support-specific questions that I would be more qualified to answer: what was the day-to-day like, what were the other staffmembers like, any crazy customer stories, and so on. Perhaps that expectation wasn't very realistic.
@_date: 2014-09-12 21:17:35
I would say applying is definitely better than not applying. Don't let me discourage you!

Dammit, Charlie. :P
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:51:53
I first really found out about Bitcoin last November, and Coinbase was the first place I opened a Bitcoin wallet. I saw they were hiring customer support people either on the Coinbase site itself or because they posted on Reddit... Don't remember which. I really enjoy doing customer support work and have a good amount of experience with it, and so on a lark decided to apply. They sent me this quiz they had created that asked lots of in-depth questions about Bitcoin. I stopped halfway through the first question and replied with an e-mail like, "Hey, I don't know much about Bitcoin but I know lots about people and customer support, and am quick to learn. If you're looking for that kind of expertise, please let me know!" About a month later they got back in touch.
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:53:45
Hah, yep, that was me. My 15 minutes of fame. :) I sold the business to new owners in May of 2013. It wasn't for a whole lot, but it was enough to let me mess around with a couple projects. I taught myself PHP and got generally better at web design, moonlit as a mascot for a minor league baseball team, got into 3D printing... Random stuff. Then Coinbase came along and unexpectedly became my day job.
I'd love to get back into physical products, though. [I just finished the website for this thing today, if you're interested.](
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:04:14
My "experience" was only 3 months, so I wouldn't want to use that as too much of a selling point, but it's a really interesting idea. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:32:18
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't know for certain. But I wouldn't recommend holding your breath.
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:23:02
Thanks for the questions!
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:45:39
Well-put. Plus, if you look at the headers of their contact e-mails (the ones in question here), they're sent using several different services, including Amazon SES and who knows what else. So that exponentially multiplies the possible sources of the problem.
But as long as GMail keeps working, I'm a happy camper.
Might be cool if they had some kind of a "notification center" in your account where all the messages went. It could be hooked up to their phone app so notifications of the notifications (notifi-ception!) showed up in your phone's status bar as with texts and stuff.
Or to just cut out the middleman and send notification texts to your phone.
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:52:48
Eh, honestly, my impression is that the people at Coinbase just want to build stuff that works well and do a good job. I think that a young company calling itself "revolutionary" is a lot like someone calling themselves "popular" — if you have to tell someone you are, you probably aren't.
That said, there were definitely moments when people would take a step back and say, "Woah, we're doing something really cool."
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:19:02
Woah. Well, I do now.
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:42:51
Yep! That's one of the perks they show on their site: 
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:18:31
You can type literally anything you want in that box and it'll process successfully. I just did it with "Humpback Whale".

@_date: 2014-09-11 21:41:42
I haven't tried it yet, but I expect you could probably engrave one on there. That's a cool idea...!
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:39:59
I love to hear myself talk, so please ask away!
I think a good customer support boss is much like a good anything boss: respectful, makes time for you, values your time, but isn't afraid to push you a bit. The only thing I'd change about my supervisors at Coinbase is it might have been nice if they took the initiative to reach out to us for feedback and conversation a bit more often.
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:22:09
Some people put in 10 hours a week, some put in 40. You make your own hours. As long as e-mails are getting answered, you have freedom to work however's best for you. For the type of work, I think the pay was really very good.
@_date: 2014-08-19 01:52:41
I think this is true of most decently-sized corporations that accept Bitcoin: just because the company is behind Bitcoin doesn't mean the employees know anything about it. I hope that will change.
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:14:02
I'm a college drop-out, I'm afraid, but if that isn't a completely hard requirement it would be awesome to get in touch with what you guys are doing. Most days I'm down in Crystal City monkeying around at TechShop, so Alexandria's just a hop and a skip away. You can see some of my background at  and I'm always open to e-mails at hello . Thanks for the thought! :)
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:03:18
Eh, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable sharing that, but by my standards it was very good pay for the work. Sorry to not be more specific. With the international launch, yeah, I think language skills are very much in demand.

Unfortunately it means that Bitcoin isn't really suited for everyday market transactions. If I go to Pizza Hut and am given the choice between paying instantly and waiting 10 minutes, it's an obvious choice. Until John Doe can buy a pizza with Bitcoin with as much convenience, it's not going to catch on.
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:00:27
Well, the existing methods are:
- Hand over a few bills.
- Swipe a card and sign a receipt.
Those still see rather more convenient...
@_date: 2016-05-24 16:50:32
True, but they feel instantaneous for the consumer, and ultimately it's the consumer who will determine whether or not Bitcoin is accepted.
Chargebacks are a protection for the consumer. I think this highlights how Bitcoin is weighted in the merchant's favor, as opposed to most other currencies which are weighted in the consumer's favor.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:35:29
I'll have a look. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:25:51
I'm sorry to hear that! You probably don't want advice, but going forward I would always use a secure exchange or at least some sort of an escrow service. Any time someone asks you to wire them money for any reason, BEFORE they've sent you the goods, use extreme caution.

I've been wondering this too. To my knowledge there's no formal way of doing it.
