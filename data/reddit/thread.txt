We hosted the first Metro Detroit meetup there, as far as I know. Corned beef sandwich for bitcoin was delicious, indeed! &lt;3 /Adam

This is what will drive adoption. I've been asking all the shops and restaurants that I visit if they accept bitcoin. I also have made an effort to submit customer feedback, emails, contact web forms, explaining why they should accept the currency, with helpful links.
Let's bring BTC adoption to the masses!

Dude, hell yes. Get that momentum going. I can't think of how this isn't a great idea.
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:25:58
That video is gold. Did he make any good points in there? He says Bitcoin is not good because it lacks "transparency, security, simplicity". Megasigh.
**why do somebody need to be anonymous!? if u has nothing to hide, what the problem??**

Last I heard it was a very limited trial with some digital goods, only. The understanding is that this is going to soon turn into a toggle for any PayPal merchant to switch, indicating they would like to accept BTC as payment.
@_date: 2014-12-08 03:52:59
Are you sure this is available, at large? I'm not sure it is yet.
@_date: 2016-03-10 20:49:27
Perfect summary.
@_date: 2014-08-31 19:35:11
Heck yes. I been bothering them for a while :)
@_date: 2016-03-10 15:31:21
Thanks for sharing this!

Interesting. First I've heard of that angle. I can say that I've used this Chase card for Coinbase buys without incident like within the past week. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 14:54:11
I assure you, all the facts were on the table, and Chase is forbidding me from making this legitimate purchase. Granted, this is a credit card, so this *is* technically not my money, I'm spending... But that doesn't exactly exonerate them.
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:17:45
So... any ideas what happened here? 
@_date: 2016-03-10 16:34:30
I suggested as much to the reps. It's the only explanation I can think of if they're unable/unwilling to resolve my issue.
It's essentially an act of war against people who thought they were allowed to spend their [own] money. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 00:17:00
Can we confirm that Capital One would allow a Coinbase backup auth to go through? I'm calling these dumb credit card companies, and most of them can't even tell me if this would be acceptable. Amazing.
Any credit cards known to work in particular besides the Elan Financial card that Grpyhraph mentioned?
I'm not even sure if it's Chase or VISA to blame.
@_date: 2016-03-10 18:05:24
Absolutely. No illusions here. This is just illustrating that fact better. From the layman's perspective, the cat is clawing at and beginning to tear the inside of the bag, so to speak :) 
@_date: 2016-03-10 14:45:58
Thank you for that thought! I'm actually a Simple customer, so I do have another avenue.
This news from Chase seemed fresh... and infuriating. This is, personally, my first such friction.
Money today just isn't what it's cracked up to be.
@_date: 2016-03-10 15:30:49
See Gryphraff's comment. This is new. Chase no longer plays ball. And I definitely let both people I spoke with know that I will be closing my account. Didn't change a thing.
@_date: 2016-03-10 15:15:19
It would be great if you were right. I spoke to 1 rep and her supervisor. I was polite and patient. They could only tell me that it was a top-down bank policy decision, and there was nothing that could be done. 
Oh, the first rep said that it was to do with the fact that "bitcoin" represents "person-to-person transactions" to which I disputed since Coinbase is a company. I wasn't going to convince her... 
@_date: 2016-03-11 01:07:30
Discover? Looks to me like Coinbase only accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard, though?
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:48:06
Lovely. Thank you for this follow-up. I'm still carefully trying to figure out which cc wants to treat me with respect. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 01:02:48
Lovely. I was depressed at the responses from a handful of cc issuers I called today. The answers only seemed to range from "No" like Chase, to "I can tell you after the charge fails" in which case, I'd need to have actually gone through the paces to obtain the credit card.
Looking forward to this alleged instant buy with a debit card method that Coinbase says they're working on. (They say only 1% of their customers currently have it as an option.)
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:52:19
Right. The card in question is a credit card, and I was still able to purchase btc -- Coinbase just makes me wait for the bank withdrawal to clear (~5 days) instead of making the coin immediately available (via what they call "instant buy").
Chase is one of the very most unfriendly institutions on the planet, so the fact that they don't respect me is of no big surprise.
@_date: 2015-08-10 01:19:22
The meaning is that it is not a cold wallet at all. Karpeles was quoted on IRC saying something about just having to go through a firewall so he could access the MtGox cold storage or something to that effect. Dat skills! 
@_date: 2015-07-19 06:54:48
They were mostly interested because I was interested. It was mostly just a matter of being persistent. I guess, as you might imagine, there isn't a great demand for bitcoin acceptance. I just explained that there isn't much of any downside to accepting bitcoin and putting the business on coinmap.org literally means new customers.
I just set both places up with BitPay, but I'm interested in other options as it seems they may be ending that service soon?
@_date: 2015-07-19 23:21:52
That said, I should add that they both have been commenting positively about people actually exercising the option.
@_date: 2015-07-18 18:41:11
I'm really glad I was able to get Josh &amp; Ed of Urban Bean Co and David at Chickpea in the D accepting bitcoins recently. I think this is how you start showing legitimacy to the new money. Small steps, but hopefully we can show others that it works and that there isn't really any reason not to offer the option.
@_date: 2015-07-19 06:30:40
Meetup, too. 
@_date: 2016-09-03 18:23:22
As a DJ, I'm a huge fan of digital-tunes.net. They've been accepting bitcoin for a long time and they don't even charge extra for lossless! (I love FLAC.) 
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:07:08
I like turtles...
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:27:21
Don't worry, the government will do that soon enough.
@_date: 2015-11-21 01:34:56
Nor Michigan.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:41:38
Exactly, yes. This is how I understand it. Court precedent says that money is speech, and as such, cannot be outlawed.
@_date: 2016-07-16 19:45:56
Remember, using money to settle debts (vs barter) is a privilege granted by those who know better than you.
