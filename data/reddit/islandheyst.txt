Nevertheless, we are the provincial capital.

Hi guys. I just noticed the Reddit referrals popping up in Google analytics. I set up/managed Lisa's campaign site and currency wallets, and have been paying out the donations in CAD to the campaign. To prove it's me, I just added a link back to this comment thread at the bottom of [Lisa's bitcoin page](
With more than 0.4 of a Bitcoin donated thus far, as far as I can tell we managed to get the most political donations in cryptocurrency ever (in Canada).
It was a very expensive campaign, fighting to defeat an incumbent backed by the NDP and other challengers with even more money (Ida Chong especially), so we're still accepting funds for a while, but only anonymous ones up to the equivalent of $50 CAD. I see we **just** got 0.0008, in fact. Thanks!
Lisa is a very smart woman, intensely entrepreneurial, and I am going to try and work with her and the City to promote the use of Bitcoin/digital currency. It's my goal to have Victoria be able to accept them for property taxes, parking fees, and anything else that we can think of.

I have to ask you to either tell me your name and address (Elections BC requirement), or I look up the transaction and refund anything over $50.

It's definitely something that will have to be ironed out. For past Bitcoin donations over $50, I have in fact received personal details, since I knew the donor. As it is now, we cannot re-direct funds over $50 to charity. I checked. Overage funds *must* be returned, even if they vapourize. It's not worth the risk to the campaign to have money that is not accounted for.

It would be turned it to City Hall as an invalid donation.

That's not true. Look at healthcare. The US spends more than 2.5x what the average OECD country spends, and shows little for it. 17.5% of your GDP goes to healthcare, and a lot of that is due to paying profit margins to insurance companies, waste, and fraud. People should not be going bankrupt when they get sick.

It was an experiment. I wanted to see if we would get any...and we did! 3998, to be precise ($1).

Thanks! Lisa has stepped away from being the ED of Community Micro Lending, but she'll still be involved in the future. Making Victoria better for all businesses, including the new ones that come out of CML, is going to a monumental task. Your support is definitely appreciated!

To my knowledge, he has not. If I Google or Duck Duck Go "Bernie Sanders Bitcoin", I actually end up at this Reddit thread, which is surreal.
That said, I am confident that he will entertain the idea because: he is a man that listens before he speaks; once someone comes to understand the concept of Bitcoin and the nature of the Blockchain, they can't help but admire it and support it as a tool for empowering people and the economies both local and global.

His amendment to that bill went through the Senate with a unanimous vote of 96-0. [
The audit went through:

Yes, more or less. All "Government" means is those things that we, as a society, do together. Taxes pay for those things, things like roads, bridges, water plants, the military, police, etc. Things where there is only one supplier, or where profit should not be involved, like in healthcare. Bitcoin and the Blockchain also have "taxes", that go towards maintaining the blockchain. It's the same thing.
As for free trade, I am for it, but only when it really is free and fair. The TPP, for example, from what I have seen of it, is none of those things.

I did not conflate them. I am not blending them into one. What I said that when a society as a group decides to do something: build a road, attack a village, plant a tree, construct a school, create a city...it forms an organization to do those things. That is a government. It is an organization of the people in a society with the expressed purpose of completing projects for the benefit of that same society.
