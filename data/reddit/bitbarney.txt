Mainly big corporations accepting BTC payments and exchanging to fiat within 24hrs, and the pressure from miners cashing out (daily). Imo. Or I'm wrong.

We'll know when someone manages to crack one of his 25k addresses holding 50 BTC each. I think that's a pretty safe system tbh.

I think if NYC wants to accept Bitcoin as a payment option they need to start setting meetings with Bitpay and/or companies alike, not the other way around. 
It seems we're entering an era where (local) govt are beginning to see the potential everyone on this subreddit has been banging on about for ages. If they want to accept Bitcoin, fine. If they don't, that's fine too. We need to stop "marketing" Bitcoin.

There are many alternatives like [Mycelium]( or the [android Bitcoin wallet]( but since your phone has no service I would recommend [Blockchain.info]( for now.

Bitcoin was invented so that bad actors can be singled out easily. 
Hail Satoshi.

Maybe we can make this a Lighthouse project?

So it's worse than a Ponzi?
A good place to start would be to use proper English on your website.
