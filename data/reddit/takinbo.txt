Very refreshing. Thanks Alah and all the best in your endeavors.

The IP the node is on, runs my personal website so it wasn't hard to find me.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:59:33
Yes. I use Web4Africa and they accept Bitcoin.

Hi, I'm the guy running the node in Nigeria and I'm happy to answer some of your questions and provide clarification on others. 
I've always wanted to run a full node but didn't find it practical for a number of reasons until about a year ago.
I don't think I run the only full node but I probably run the only publicly reachable node. A reason why other nodes are not visible might be as a result of how the majority of the ISPs essentially share IPs, use NAT for all outgoing connections and essentially block all incoming connections.
Up until when I started running a publicly reachable full node (now pruned), the only way to have a server was bare metal at a data center. Thought running a full node on a VPS was expensive enough? It cost even more to run bare metal; making it impractical for the purposes of just running a full node.
The first local VPS services launched around the time I started running the full node and due to the lower costs of running a VPS, the opportunity to run the node finally presented itself.
These servers are still not as common as they're more expensive than similarly spec'ed options in other locations so running a local node was specifically done to further decentralize the network and to provide lower latency for other nodes in close proximity.

Turns out the opposite is what obtains. Bitcoin is a good solution for poor countries. Poor countries don't have robust financial infrastructure/institutions to handle the demands of modern day commerce.
Despite the high fees for bitcoin transactions in recent times, the alternative options are more expensive.
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:50:01
Normally, yes. However, I'm running a node mainly to further decentralize the bitcoin network and for development purposes; besides I use the server for other services besides a bitcoin node.

So the author of the article reached out to me on twitter after finding my node on bitnodes.21.co
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:41:01
Thank you @_date: 2017-03-30 07:40:11
Yes. Electrum as from version 2.8.0 supports CPFP. Simply right-click on an unconfirmed transaction and select "Child pays for parent"
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:26:03
The most common size of a P2PKH transaction is 226 bytes. This is assuming one input and two outputs; the second output being the change address. 
Yes (in theory) you can have a P2SH address that requires only one signature even though that is not common. I don't have information about the common size of a P2SH transaction that requires only one signature.

It's called a fork because it's a deviation from the former consensus rules. It's "soft" because it is backwards compatible and works in a way that permits the old consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:47:03
In deed, that's about the cost of broadband connections within the metro areas and bigger cities, though the data caps are not such that would encourage running publicly reachable full nodes without tuning parameters that limit bandwidth usage.
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:47:49
If I may add, this only works for transactions that have signalled Replace By Fee (or RBF) or have RBF enabled. On the desktop, you can look for the Electrum wallet - 
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:44:38
Greenbits. Simply enable "transaction replacement" in the settings.
@_date: 2016-06-06 10:12:50
Unless they were both using a BIP47 compatible wallet like Samourai Wallet.

Kenya (and most of East Africa and Southern Africa) has a robust mobile payment system that is quite ubiquitous and even foreigners can use. If you were to do the same in other parts of Africa, you would either need to convert your bitcoins to cash (requiring a face to face transaction) or have the funds deposited in a bank account which wouldn't be favorable for a traveler on a short visit or without the appropriate documentation. 
Mobile money is getting popular in other countries in Africa (like Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon) so this is going to change very soon, if it hasn't already started changing.
@_date: 2016-06-15 10:01:16
You are right about the second address most likely being your change address. One way to confirm is to check if your new balance is just less the amount of the payment you made. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:53:34
I presume you already have a paper wallet printed. If not, take a look at the instructions on 
After printing the paper wallet, you want to transfer only a small amount of bitcoins at first. Now try recovering the bitcoins from the paper wallet so you're comfortable loading and spending bitcoins from paper wallets then print out another paper wallet and then send all the bitcoins you want to save to it.

And if it's an empty block? That is a block having only the coinbase transaction, what would that look like?
@_date: 2016-11-03 08:43:06
Thanks &gt;Blocks aren't allowed to be empty. They must have at least the coinbase transaction. 
What would the coinbase transaction look like in the future when the subsidy ends?
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:52:53
The transaction was only 338 bytes so couldn't have had many inputs/outputs. It was in deed a very high fee to pay for a transaction.
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:39:54


We do! 
@_date: 2016-11-15 11:00:05
I do hope coin.dance adds this to their charts. I started tracking weekly volume a while back -

Can I have my Bitcoin Expert badge now? :D
@_date: 2019-10-10 06:57:22
Not much. I don't know C++ but I do know something about Python and the codebase had a utility with a bug in it that I was able to fix.
Besides being able to fix bugs or create new features, being able to identify one is the bigger opportunity and it comes from using the software as much as possible.
I came across this bug a couple of times in the past but thought it was occuring due to disk corruption which was fixed by simply resyncing my node. The last time it happened, I was trying to export a copy of the block data for a colleague. After studying the code to understand what was going on, I then figured what was going on and only then was I able to write a better solution.

Oh no! My evil master plan has been exposed!

Speaking of which mably has a web-based frontend to lnd [here]( and you can view the screenshots [here]( as well.
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:59:14
Thank you. Now I'm also an expert :p

Tap the filter button (triple dash) and ensure "All payments" is selected and you'll also see the outgoing payments. Right now, I suspect "Received payments" is what is currently selected. 
@_date: 2016-09-09 04:00:47
The green ones are received payments and the red ones are sent payments. For you to have a balance of 0mBTC, then it means you or someone else is spending the mBTC you are receiving leaving a balance of 0mBTC.

This is purely from a transactional point of view and not taking into effect the roles that each player in the market is performing.
The buyer and the seller have different motives for being in the market. When studying markets, this qualitative attribute plays a major role in understanding why the market exists and can serve as a prediction as to where the market is headed.
@_date: 2016-10-25 13:36:18
I suggest you actually confirm that the exchange rate is favourable next time before paying. It might just have been a bad time to make the transaction.
Generally I've found bitpay's exchange rate to be reasonable so this is not a common occurrence. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 11:08:13
It's likely that the difference came from the fees you paid to have the transaction confirmed. Are you able to confirm this?
@_date: 2016-10-25 10:05:41
Well, also consider the fact that if you've had your BTC for a while, then you might have enjoyed some appreciation in the value of your holdings and so it actually cost you less in real terms; unless you had plans to buy back the BTC you spent.

I live there; and despite the volume not being huge when compared to the economy in total, it represents an increasing awareness of the cryptocurrency.
I've studied the market for over two years and the majority of the current volume is generated by people selling bitcoin for naira as compared to those buying bitcoin with naira.
In addition, localbitcoins is only one of several exchanges that bitcoins are being traded in the country.
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:47:54
A number of people are turning to bitcoin as a hedge against further currency devaluation. Also it offers better value for money when used as a vehicle for remittances today (as much as 40%)
@_date: 2016-10-03 15:01:48


Localbitcoins is an OTC marketplace where users post ads to sell and/or buy bitcoins.
Other users are able to sell their bitcoins in response to ads offering to buy bitcoins in exchange for fiat or buy bitcoins in response to ads offering to sell bitcoins in exchange of fiat.
My argument was that the higher percentage of trades are happening as a result of users selling bitcoins in response to ads offering to buy these bitcoins for fiat. This is illustrated by the fact that (by volume) there is more bitcoin going after the naira than there is naira going after bitcoin which points to the likely fact that bitcoin is being used for capital importation (remittance, exports, etc.)
On the buy side, volume has also picked up, which is partly as a result of currency hedging, international payments amongst others (MMM included).

Then looks like you got a really bad exchange rate.
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:39:12
Depends on what you're comparing it to.
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:38:18
Not the only reason.
