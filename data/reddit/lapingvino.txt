Also don't forget Twister.

Already 3 posts (including one of mine), not bad for such a young subreddit ;).

BRL is over the 2000 for a long time already ;)

Not true, people mined bitcoin before it had value.
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:05:51
How long have you been doing Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-23 14:42:45
You are right. In 2017 most services that supported Bitcoin stopped supporting it, because when reaching the block size limit, fees became exorbitant and it took DAYS to confirm some payments. I used to do the biggest part of my life with Bitcoin. Only a shim of what was possible then is now left, and it's starting to come back in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem, but far from what we had. Bitcoin as we have it now is a brick with a high price tag.
I used to pay my divorce with Bitcoin with basically no costs involved. I was absolutely blessed to have Bitcoin supporting the harder parts of my life. Now fucking Western Union is basically always the better option.
I have never been so mad about anything in my life. There was one simple solution for all this crap, and the development blew it.

Don't worry, it will be a low amount, I will just be collecting the miner fee \*diabolic laughter\*

I have been using Bitcoin out of necessity many times after, but because as by the hostile takeover devs and community "it's not for small payments" even though in some situations it's the only option out there, it costed me a lot. If nothing else, there is definitely a bigger niche in society for a payment crypto than a gold-replacing brick.
My friends in Africa are all into crypto and mostly just work with Bitcoin, losing significant amounts of money for their standards. If 2017 didn't happen, they would probably consider it for more than just investment. Which is basically the point of the current state of BTC, keep the poor poor and make the rich richer, as also stated in a FOSDEM talk "the rich don't need help to get richer".
Bitrefill when hearing about my situation and asking for amends first labeled me in their system a BCH shill, before showing some empathy for the crappy stuff I suffered because of 2017. Anyone involved in this bullshit, this nonsense has real victims and that has to stop.

I know what Bitcoin can do. And you know too. In 2017 Bitcoin was murdered.
@_date: 2019-12-23 00:35:40
Yep, loved using it until end 2017 when it became basically impossible to defend Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:06:55
So you should know. If you keep stupid, people will figure it out for themselves. Which is better because this is a shit show.

Define what you see as decentralized. The problem is that there are different parts of the project that should be more or less decentralized. Development is a particularly hard position, because you influence how the system works. If you hijack development, the decentralization of the rest doesn't matter as much. Which is what Blockstream did. Linking the essence of Bitcoin up to the existing systems in such a way that universal participation is in no way accomplishable.
I am not sure what the real solution to this is, but so far ironically to me it seems IOTA does this best. But they don't have as much infrastructure in place yet for it to be useful, and there is still a distribution issue. No crypto has any decentralization so far other than infrastructural decentralization, which is a great first step but not enough on its own. Scalability is another important part of universal participation, where this community received a lot of promises but less and less actual return. Without the possibility for everyone to take part you don't get any actual security you want from decentralization, because the pals needed will just be cut off, as happened with the Core development.
I forgot to mention before: the fee hike of 2017 basically broke multisig, which meant that [localbitcoins.com]( became basically useless (and a product I ordered on OpenBazaar could never be delivered - lucky enough they implemented other coins soon after, and to date BTC is basically useless on OpenBazaar because multisig for buyer protection makes it really expensive).

no, it's not, because Iran doesn't have internationals wire transfers. It is economically cut of from the world. That's why local exchanges of Bitcoin is one of the cheapest ways to get money anywhere.

Bitcoins don't have transaction fees, and they are completely tradeable like any other currency :)
@_date: 2011-06-10 23:09:11
That's about what 0.02 dollars was worth when that expression was born ;)
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:23:03
end-user to end-user hasn't. buying bitcoin you have transaction fees from the payment processor and using services you can have transaction fees, but direct user-to-user payment is completely free.

You can set the price yourself, and the base price is set for an album with at least 10 songs, more or less. I think most never change that, even if it doesn't make sense... It's more a way to support artists than anything else anyway.

Things already are interesting: paid with bitcoin to a Brazilian account, 3500 BRL on that account, paid the equivalent of 3445 BRL in Euros :).

Tbh, it's not my site, but I did put that specific artist up there

This is how you should do it ;)

Ah how sad! Well, another time then, bookmark this and buy later 😉.

Aracaju though has a lot of locations by now iirc.
@_date: 2015-10-25 16:36:08
I dare you try :). I think Paypal would come closest, but they too do have to back up from several locations, and charge like crazy...

Rest is in cash I suppose...
