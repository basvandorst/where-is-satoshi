I've always felt that Robocoin was a scam, which makes me sad because they are popping up everywhere.
I really want to put Lamassu bitcoin ATM's inside of Book stores and coffee shops.  I feel bad for Robocoin trying to pioneer this space, but bitcoin ATM's are the big elephant in the room that bitcoiners look at and go "Well, I mean, IIIII would never use it, but when the next bubble comes people will FLOCK to it".... which is naive and really a mess.  
Any smart bitcoiner is going to use Coinbase/Circle, or if they want anonymity, craigslist or Localbitcoins.  Its not hard to figure out that unless bitcoin atms have a negligible spread and standard $2.50 fee per transaction, that these ATM's will go nowhere.  Its a shame, but people are talking to their states about how to fix this problem, and frankly until it is, these ATM's are garbage.
Our local ATM folks don't even disclose the transaction amounts.  Apparently we have the highest used atm in the country, but until a bitcoin ATM experience can look like [this]( no one will use it.
Please tell me I'm wrong.

You guys do realize that  dislodging trust in an old system is very hard to do.  Either the reputation of bitcoin businesses needs to improve which takes **time**, or the reputation of the financial system has to degrade, which takes **time**.
This shit doesn't happen overnight.  We need patience, tenacity, and passion to build a community and currency/protocol that will really be an honest alternative to people, and to be honest, we aren't there yet.  Don't rush it.  I give it another 4 years before we are even as big as discover card, merchant acceptance-wise, but that's only if the delusion is checked at the door and the reality and passion gets checked back in.

Its called being a professional, and adding sugar to make the medicine go down sweet.  Did you not see the subsequent criticisms?  
In the real world, you have to kiss a little ass to get things done.  I can assure you, Bitpay is no more thrilled at the regulations than you or I are.  However, did you not see the huge laundry list of things they have a problem with?  Yeah, it includes *some* the things *we* have a problem with, including:








I myself am not trying to kiss Bitpay's ass either, but come on, they were also looking out for other players in the space as well, not just them.  I think we need to give them just a tiny bit more credit, all things considered...

@_date: 2014-10-28 10:33:40
Actually it isn't. Btc remittances will only be viable when there is honest liquidity across the markets, ie the demand for bitcoin is high enough that the person on the receiving end doesn't need to convert.  If people on both sides of the transaction have to pay 5-7% And potentially suffer a 5% volatility loss, you are looking at a potentially ~20% fee.
You can't compete in the remittance market with high fee liquidity stop gaps.  We need to build tools and use cases for bitcoin to expand the community.  Until then,  these liquidity sources are more likely to turn users away than increase adoption.

I'm a small time miner (about 3 TH/S).  I have broken even on all my gear and then some so far (and I still have the gear, making about .1 a day currently).  I've been selling gear slowly and replacing it with more power effecient gear.  Companies like bitmain  keep mining affordable and profitable for the at home miner.  They just launched a new product yesterday, and I would say ROI is in the sights.  I'd pick one or two up and throw um in the garage.  Its a great way to support bitcoin by mining at a small pool or p2p pool, AND you can take some power away from the big guys.  ROI is still very common.  You just have to be weary of most ASIC manufacturers, as there are a lot of bad apples in this field.  I can say though, bitmaintech is not one of them.  Good luck!

The problem with mining is you have to know the market, and it will takeyoua while, or must know someone.  I can say at this very second, unless you can find  reasonably priced second hand miners ( which you don't know how yet to define reasonable) put mining on the back burner for now.  Aside from that, I wouldn't mine unless you are already a bitcoin holder.  Not only is mining for fiat profit a drain on our ecosystem, but it is simply too risky.  If done improperly, you could end up ordering from a company that goes bankrupt before shipping.
Aside from that, go to some of the links posted here and try some learning before buying.  The more confident you are in what you have learned about bitcoin, the better of you will be, investing or not. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 22:24:25
Dude, you are telling me!  I actually look forward to reading the bitcoinland world news.  The big downward market shifts still stress me out sometimes, but not enough to do much about.  
I agree with SR2 as well.  It seems like some european countries that are more open to drugs as a social problem would be open to Silk Road type distributions.
And I don't know, I'm such a bitcoiner now that it would feel weird to not have some of my money in bitcoin.  Its definitely on my mind quite a bit, and I definitely believe in its future.  Sometimes I think it would be better if I didn't hold so much though.  But then again, I want to be personally vested in its success as much as I can.  Its a catch 22, whatevvss..

Hey guys,
I am a long time bitcoiner and Baduk/Go player here.  Since you seem to be ingrained in small/niche communities, might I suggest adding one more to the list:  The Go community.  Go is a game originating from China over 5000 years ago and is still the most popular game in the world today.  Recently, many westerners are getting into it.  Although many people record their games on tablet apps, I wonder if you could make a Baron Fig with just game record sheets in it:
They look something like this.  Certainly, if you made a small run of at least 100-200, I know the folks over at would eat it up.

* 2) Merchants offering significant discounts when using Bitcoin over any other payment method (except for like, their own CC... that's allowed ;))
* 3) Price of Bitcoin constantly rising.
* 4) Consumers going "These goddamn bitcoiners get everything for cheaper.  Guess I'll buy some bitcoins.
* 5) I sell the rest of my fiat.

Whats worse are the bitcoiners who go in there and say "You just don't get it" or try and make other people feel stupid just because well, they believe what they hear on the news about bitcoin.  We need to lead by example and be level headed and explain ourselves well as to why anyone would want to do this.  I agree maybe this roadtrip with publicity is silly, but these comments are rough!
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:43:33
Circle gets this.  They will charge 0% fee.  BTC Spreads are kept relatively low by traders now, and I think Circle just charges people in the middle of the spread for both buy and sell so its the same in a small time frame.  Therefore, unless we are in the middle of a huge price swing, a normal user won't see guaranteed volatility from purchase to finish.

Before giving tips away to newbs, we need to audit their accounts.  I know, I know, its fun to say we gave bitcoin to 6000 new people, but lets give more bitcoin to more established redditors, and skip the new accounts.

Losing 15-20% of my initial investment is pretty hard to swallow (About where I am now), but that doesn't mean I'm throwing in the proverbial bitcoin towel as it were.
I see this as a very healthy time for bitcoin.  Hopefully those mining companies who were mining bitcoin for themselves have realized that the market was not liquid enough for 100% cashouts to fiat, and that if you were going to mine bitcoin, you better believe in it.
And remember, what doesn't kill bitcoin makes it stronger.  I'm insanely bullish on bitcoin and its ability to self-correct.  It is a technology that is designed to resist centralization, in almost every way.  It resists censorship.  Exchanges like BTC-E and the soon-to-be p2p exchanges are powerful.
So what if you lost some fiat?  I'm going to have to work a lot of overtime/or get a second job to be where I want to be in my savings at this point to purchase a house next year, but I planned for that possibility.  If you are this emotional over the bitcoin price, then clearly you never believed in it in the first place.
Are you on the "lets bring bitcoin to the masses" Circle/Coinbase delusional train?  The sooner you get off that and realize that bitcoin isn't ready for that, the faster you can get off your ass and say "How can I use the blockchain or bitcoin technology to make something fricken' awesome?
I realize this is probably your first "investment", and you thought it was a sure fire when because unlike those pigs on wallstreet - you 'get' this shit, after all, you're a millennial who sees the tech.  It just makes too much sense not to work, right? Well then, stop freaking out and see this as an ecosystem correction.  Because for fucks sake, we've needed it.

I panic bought with my life savings at $350 when shit hit the fan a couple weeks ago.  I said "BITCOIN MUST NOT DIE", and then emptied my bank account on coinbase and went to sleep waking up every 5 minutes.
I later sold some of them back at $450, but I've been panic hodling ever since! lol.
I only take losses on stocks, options and altcoins.  I wouldn't sell bitcoin at a loss because that just means I'm being impatient.  I do save a certain portion of my income to go towards buying BTC.  However, I usually use that during China bad news, cuz in the long run Bitcoin will be fine, and of course, who doesn't like a good sale? lol

Honestly I think occasional promotions are better.  Consumers don't generally care about 1-2%, and usually isn't enough to make people interested.  If TigerDirect is taking the liberty in offering a 10% discount, or free shipping when you pay with bitcoin, that, is HUGE because not only does it make us already bitcoiners happy.  It tickles a "would-be bitcoiner" into possibly taking the plunge.

Even my friends here in the US can't even think to afford investing in aaaaaanything whatsoever.  I have a few bitcoin friends, but with the exception of a buddy of mine that owns like .5, all of them have incomes of 70k or more.  You just can't even consider something like bitcoin unless you have plenty of savings and income.  Coming from a poor family myself, the first 5 years I was saving I didn't even consider investing in anything other than nabbing the best interest rate on my bank account by switching to a credit union.  Poor people are extremely financially risk averse on average, and when you run across the educated poor in the US, you start towonder which came first, but I digress...  
My hope is that low fee atms become ubiquitous worldwide soservices like rebit will have to be like bitcoin and adapt to the ever changing financial landscape.   Because the end goal is that in a few years time, all these bootstrapping services that make up for a lack of liquidity will be not needed.  
But one thing is for sure, while market cap stays below 100B, bitcoin probably won't bea useful enough store odd value to the poor, for even small amounts of money...

Are you serious?  It has nothing to do with what CURRENCY was used, but everything to do with the fact that CREDIT CARDS are their only method of accepted payment.
The company is obviously worried about chargebacks (Edit:  Something you CAN'T do with bitcoin).  They don't need my PII or Identity information for ANY other reason, other than making sure someone isn't purchasing a bunch of stolen goods with fraudulent CC's.  
As you may know, if they accepted bitcoin they would have no reason to hold my order, no reason to have my identity, and furthermore, no reason for me to waste my and their customer service peoples time between waiting on hold and hashing out all those "identity questions".  Imagine, they have a room full of people that do these "identity verifications" all day long.  What. A. Waste.

One thing that always interested me is the time frame of which a person "acting in their own best interest" can come back and bite them in the ass.
For instance, McDonald's can sell food that increases their bottom line for a few years by replacing food with food-like products, and since it doesn't kill their clientele in the short term, everybody wins.  Consumers get cheaper food, and McDonalds makes more money.
But what happens when McDonalds starts selling food that starts killing people in say, a year, two years?  Pretending there is no FDA to remedy this problem (as their certainly isn't for bitcoin) how long does McDonalds continue to kill off its customers and at what rate is that still in their best interest?
The answer is: As long as its still profitable.  Making money and morals have a very interesting history, but the funny thing is, in the long term, the two coincide very well.  Some fast food chains which now enjoy insane profits that McDonalds can no longer compete with, and have a huge runway in which to do it with (see: CMG, PNRA, etc) are appealing to people and a small benefit of their product:  Their customers will be alive longer on average to continue being a consumer of said business.
So where am I going with this?  Ghash and centralized mining pools that are irresponsible run the risk of turning us into pink slime in the long term if they don't behave.  We should all be prepared to walk away from bitcoin if either the core devs won't fix the problem technically or the community can't self regulate appropriately.  
The beautiful thing about bitcoin though, is that Ghash stands the most to lose from this shenanigans, and this recent price drop will continue if significant action isn't taken in the coming weeks.  
So if you're a dev, help work on P2P nodes that deliver awesome services.  If you're a regular miner, consider switching to a small pool or P2P pool.  If you are mining conglomerate, set up a transparent plan to move significant hashing power to the P2P effort and let the community know about it.  We don't necessarily need the Core Dev team to act as the hashing police right now, but what we do need is action.

Seems like you have a little bit of paranoia in some weird areas.  Why all the confirming it went through and checking it twice after generating a keypair?  I don't think I have heard of any issues with keypair generation being bogus with the github paperwaller software.
You might consider using BIP38 on your paper wallets and using the Ironkey flash drives to store your wallet on, as I use Ironkey and am really satisfied with it.  I understand the diversification in manufacturers, though, and ofc, Ironkey themselves is likely to have a backdoor, but if your backups are BIP38 encrypted then the diversification becomes irrelevant unless you are simply trying to counter manufacturer defects.
My recommendation :  Live Boot onto a storageless device that you plug the flash drives onto that has the GitHub paperwallet software on.  No need to buy a separate device, you could just take the HDD out of your computer and boot from a disc.  If anyone tries to poke holes in this, they are so paranoid its not even funny.  Then send funds to the public addresses you generate.  what you could do is pass out a multisig wallet that has a Private Key that equates to the BIP38 password of your wallets also and provide this instruction on your death, or whatever.
You should not be more paranoid about your cold storage.  Why set up the monitoring wallet?  If you have the majority of your bitcoins in a hot wallet like coinbase, that would cause more levels of paranoia than cold storage.  Hell, I'm so paranoid that I am afraid to logon to my coinbase account from a public computer and even my own.  My point is that:  Be paranoid, but also be paranoid about the right things.  The only "testing" of the paper wallets you need to do is a test decrypt to make sure you didn't typo the BIP38 encryption.  If it decrypts successfully, you are golden.
@_date: 2014-11-01 20:34:49
This is tempting indeed!  
@_date: 2014-08-09 14:25:45
There has been ideas floated for multisig wallets to do this quite easily. or even having servies like Netflix saying "your bill is due" when you owe a past due balance, by popping up a QR code on the screen.  So long as there are certs backing it are relatively sure it isn't XSS, then viola!
Having that built into such a way into the protocol itself could be handy, but honestly, I wouldn't want that.  I don't set up recurring payments for almost anything.  Not my cell, not my cable, not my insurance.  The fact of the matter is, these companies like to add fees whenever they can, and I want to be able to control whether or not they can tack them on.  Better to catch them on the bill than retroactively trying to get your money back.  I'm sure bitcoin will have text-to-pay payment processor options for highly trusted merchants that you login to something like coinbase and "allow pushed invoices" or something from said companies.  That way I could text back to coinbase and say something like "Authorize Netflix", and it would pay the Netflix invoice it sent me.  
I have no problem keeping some bitcoin in coinbase.  What you should have a problem with is keeping any more than 20% of your bitcoin there... maybe slightly more with the vault.  Enough for convenience and spending and taking a small burden of key management off your own shoulders, but not enough to where if coinbase shit the bed, you would no longer have the will to live in bitcoin land.
And to be honest, I think the vault services are a big help for people like me who, aren't worried as much about a company-wide hack that would jeopardize coinbase as a company, but more so my own personal account getting hacked somehow.

The bitcoin universe is full of scams and risks.  Do you know how hard it is to consider anything in the bitcoin universe trustworthy?  If you are talking about ghash, on what basis is an anonymous overseas investment you pay with an anonymous pushed payment method  in a speculative market at all trustworthy or by any stretch of a good idea?  Cloud mining comes with maintenance fees, roi is rare, and this space is full of people trying to fiat out, who ultimately don't have the patience to or fortitude to weather the storm.  Sign up for task rabbit, if you have a decent car or bicycle sign up for a messenger service, but for the love of god don't expect to cash out of an ecosystem you clearly don't know anything about.  Hate to crush your dreams of a little extra easy money while in college, but that's not what this ecosystem is for.  This is a sea of sharks waiting for the uninitiated to get in over their heads before they strike you down and eat you for lunch.  This is no supplement for a part timejob.  Playing options is way easier to get consistent payouts, but there isno easy money here.  I've done way better on paper simply holding my bitcoin, but it seems you don't have the patience for that, so I'd suggest thepart time job route.  Good luck.

Some bitcoiners don't care too much about anonymity.  Most people will buy happily from coinbase or circle, and sell small amounts to people at a 2-5% markup for people who DO care about it.

Hey there,
So I just want to make everyone aware that when you use a coinbase wallet, it breaks up the funds to a system where it is immediately converted into cold storage.  Coinbase's automated system is constantly doing checks, moves and sends to cold storage and vise versa. 
Where the coins actually live is irrelevant in terms of blockchain and ownership.  Coinbase remembers your personal balance, but they pool the funds into cool storage and use a method that sends them to new addresses that are generated from a master address to obfuscate their cold storage holdings and transfer methods.  OP is by no means malicious and I am ashamed that the first thing this subreddit does is send accusations.  Its really quite sad.

Before giving tips away to newbs, we need to audit their accounts.  I know, I know, its fun to say we gave bitcoin to 6000 new people, but lets give more bitcoin to more established redditors, and skip the new accounts.

No.  It sounds like you have never worked with a company like Bitpay and Coinbase.  They add rails to the system and are willing to take 0 confirmation risk, as are most people in POS.  I'd be AMAZED if someone could pull off a double spend while being tied up with a payment on the phone.  That would take some serious coordination efforts!
Truth is, unless we find another malleability type bug, 0 confirmation payments are pretty damn secure.

Sure chipotle and tesla have been great investments and challenge their industries in their own right, but bitcoin has a community, bitcoin has people who devote their lives to the blockchain.  The same can hardly be said for delicious burritos, awesome as they may be  .  Bitcoins real value is being there when people need it.

The problem with all these metrics is they don't mean anything.  Last time I scraped the blockchain and found one address that had 800 unconfirmed 0 tx fee transactions.
I wish it weren't so, but this graph is the only thing that means something, because it means, at LEAST if someone wants to add a few thousand transactions to the network as fluff, they have to pay to do it:

Significant buys for newbies during times of volatility is not recommend.  Larger risk, potentially smaller reward after an already huge $100 rally.
That said, I'm confident we will go another 20-30$ short term, but mid term?  I don't really see us crashing through $500 like its going out of style.  For the past year people have pretty much agreed that 1 bitcoin should be worth about $500.  Its psychologically sound, it still "feels" cheap compared to $1200, and its easy to do math with.  Along with all those, it has a ton of game theory with mining/etc. that suggests $500 would be a good "stable" price, if something like this could be stable, even in the short term.
I foresee a $475-$525 battle for the rest of November no doubt.  But I'll be happy to see it, that's for certain.  Larger volatility to play with, and a price point which makes me less stressed out.
The $300's are/were very stressful because even the more successful of traders still hold the majority of their bitcoins, and had an Avg cost of acquisition in the $400's ( about $410 here) or higher.  Additionally, it didn't feel like shorting was an option so traders grew bored as well.  Hopefully I don't lose my ass in the coming weeks playing with more bits on exchanges :)

I don't know how this has so many upvotes, and why in the hell this thread is on a witch hunt against Vinny/Gyft.  
Apple Pay is being HUGELY subsidized by Apple for merchants to use it.  Once the adoption curve hits critical mass, they are going to pull the rug on the promo rates.  Gyft does this because they make more money on Apple Pay purchases because they are paid to.  In case you didn't notice, they run a business over there.  They aren't going to stand on principal in defense of bitcoin just because they love it.  They need to make their investors money. 
If you all think this is a good enough reason to ditch gyft, you are all idiots.

Can we stop saying bitcoin fees are 5 cents?  Bitcoin transactions are free and Hi Pri fee was reduced to .0001 static minimum which is about .42% of 1 cent fee at current exchange rates with a floating % of additional costs.  They have been adding things like floating fees, but this is the official word:

Fungibility is important in terms of bitcoin, that said, freshly mined coins do have the added benefit of not being able to be traced back to any malicious activity.  I think you could check local bitcoins and see if a market develops there.  The benefit of selling mined coins to someone who intends to gamble with it without your knowledge is you don't have to worry about coinbase Shutting down your account because they think you are the gambler.  It's hard to know if buyers will care, but sellers might charge a premium for them to non established buyers when the seller doesn't know the intention of the buyer.  I think we are too illiquid tomatter at this point.  But as a point of good practice I think all miners mine to clean wallets anyway

You need short sellers for a healthy market.  Besides, even if you are loaning bitcoin to hopefully sell at a lower price later, the fact of the matter isyourare still, in effect, buying bitcoin.  Shorts create buy pressure.  In fact, I would argue the schmucks that go margin long (like me) are worse for the overall market stability, because we use capitol to loan out more capitol to buy bitcoin with money we don't actually have.But then again, it has been known to create bubbles, so you know, that's supposedly good in the bitcoin world, right?

As a former popular streamer, this has a great potential to create many more users.  Twitch is a perfect example of an amazing use case.  Twitch is a community platform of gamers all around the world supporting each others gaming with micropayments.  
Some of those people might ask "what well can I do with bitcoin".  You needn't direct them any further than subscribing to their favourite streamer.
Twitch is riddled with tech savvy kids that don't have attached bank accounts to paypal, or cannot get a paypal period.  Bitcoin could be an exciting way to sidestep that.

I'm glad you are coming forward with who you are now.  I have been messaging **all the people you have been tipping** and have thread conversations with many of them saying they **never received any of your tips.**
I was the recipient of a $5 tip from you, and didn't receive it, and noticed you were tipping a lot. For the sake of other users privacy, I won't post their names, I think me being known in the community is good enough, but I'll give you one example of me asking if they received them:
*from h***** sent 13 hours ago*
*Doesn't seem like it, no private message from yet.*
I had added you to my list of scammers and shills and was close to reporting you to the mods once I got a little more proof.

There are more than you would think.  And a few folks from the speedrunning community have played around with it.  Dogecoin was a popular thing on twitch for a month or two.  The problem is not enough people use it or have it.  would sponsor some twitch events, and if anyone would be interested I could create a race or talk with the folks at speedrunslive or SDA to create bitcoin tournaments.

I don't know where this elitism claim has come from except for the people promoting the Dogecoin community, which is all fine and good, I'm a Dogecoiner myself, but they they take stabs at the Bitcoin community is pretty troubling.

With old Cointerra equipment yes, but keep in mind the miners that are being shipped now have less than half of that power requirement, and ACTUALLY do 2 th/s.
As a miner in Washington state, I have nothing to worry about, as my cost basis per coin (since LUCKILY ROI'ing in BTC terms about a month ago) is still quite low (around $200 per 1 BTC in power costs).
The people who have the S3 however, if the difficulty rise stays low, we should be able to mine with them for quite a while before being overcome by the Cheap/Free power people, which would, at some point, effect even the WA state miners and other folks with cheap power...

1)  - I'm not sure why this hasn't been posted yet.  It is the  bitcoin price site because of its pretty lines and graphs.
2) Its a rough game.  I'm still mining, but getting in now is harsh.  I'm in a buy and hold mode and spend where and when I can mode.
3)  No.
4) No.
5) No.
6)  Mmmm, I would do blockchain.info probably.  Try and go to a bitcoin meetup if you can, and buy a small amount and look up the various ways of storing it.  Paper wallets/ mobile wallets/cold storage/web wallets and the benefits and drawbacks of each.  For the most part though, blockchain.info will do just fine.

You could quash the haters with a video of your son talking about bitcoin pretty easily, so I mean, I'd be inclined to clear my name if it were me that's for sure.  Someone in the community put up a valid concern with your post.  Now, an experienced bitcoiner knows that half this sub is largely driven by shills and bots preying on people's enthusiasm for the technology.  Instead of proving yourself you just curl up in a ball and say you are never going to post here again?  Come on man, we arebitcoiners, if we aren't skeptical then we Will be taken for a ride.  Skepticism is what has kept my btc on cold storage and out of mt gox.  Skepticism is what made us not invest in neo and bee.  Skepticism and pessimism is why I'm not completely in the red from trading this year, and my god man, if you can't respect someone's skepticism of you, then you clearly aren't a bitcoiner...

Commodities are taking a beating all around because people are having more faith in currencies (which is hilarious), and rather park their money in companies.  More and more investors are taking Warren Buffets investing style in that it doesn't matter what a particular currency or good is worth, only the companies that produce the goods and services that matter.
Bitcoin is unique in that unlike a lot of commodities, its malleable in ways we don't even understand yet.  The same could be said about Petrol and Plastics, but this ecosystem is new and exciting, and theoretical possibilities and actualities are manifesting constantly.
It being so nascent (low market cap also) though, and so unique, I don't think it has any correlation with any other commodity out there.  The only correlation you can draw is if giant tech companies start laying people off in droves, and then a lot of the bitcoiners wouldn't be able to afford bitcoin, however, I reckon a lot of them would enter the bitcoin-o-sphere.

This is very much true.  One needs to look no further than comparing the Seattle and Vancouver bitcoin communities.  Whenever I go to Vancouver I get immediately saddened by their Meetup groups prevalence throughout the city (because Seattle's should be better/comparable, imho), and to be honest, I think they should be an example for how a lot of smaller cities have meetups.
It seems like these folks are a bunch of foodies, they roll around restaurant to restaurant with a mob of people every week or two paying with huge groups in bitcoin.  Small businesses get a little boost just by acknowledging the community, and essentially get free business.  Would be a major selling point if you were a new business trying to get noticed - Ally with the bitcoiners, right?!

Update your bitcoin clients.  You know that the transaction fee has been chopped 10x to .00001, right?
Also, this fee is OPTIONAL.  Your money will still get to where its going eventually, so if you don't pay the fee, just be patient.  Many smaller pools mine all transactions regardless of tx fee paid or not.

Honestly, this is the best news I've seen in weeks.  Its hard when there are all these iPhone wallets that most android users don't use, and when I tell people to get into bitcoin, I'm not going to recommend something (regardless of their reviews) that I haven't tried.  This makes my life easier as a "bitcoin evangelist" of sorts, and it makes bitcoin feel a lot less in its infancy when everyone at the table has the option of getting the same wallet.  
This makes consumer adoption easier.  My mother and my girlfriend (who uses coinpunk now) will both be downloading this app, as my mom was asking me about weird ones on the app store, and my response was "mom just wait a month or two, I don't know any of those ones, but the good ones are coming back!"

No, the only reason this is true is when you expose the Private key to an online device.  By signing a transaction offline, and syncing only the transaction hash and not exposing your private key, the level of insecurity you are introducing to your cold storage is so close to 0 that its literally 0.
Edit:  Unless you don't know what you are doing to perform this process*, but done correctly... = 0

If you guys spent half as much time educating your friends and family and getting more USERS into bitcoin as you did trying to get businesses to accept it, you wouldn't need to beg all these companies to accept it.  Think about that.
I talked bitcoin with a buddy of mine for a couple hours yesterday, and by the end of it, he bought 1 full BTC.
There are over 100,000 people that subscribe to this reddit, if each one of you got 1 person to buy $100 worth of BTC, we would be looking at a very different bitcoin price right now.
Leave the Merchant adoption to the professionals like Coinbase.  They are hiring dozens of people to do this in a professional b2b manner.  Get your local businesses to accept it, and friends who run webstores on etsy or something like this, but can we just take a BREAK on soliciting all these businesses for 10 seconds and focus on User adoption?

I like Coinbase, and as such I would recommend you keep small amounts of bitcoin there unquestionably.  Do so however, with 2FA.  If you get a few bitcoins under your belt, consider moving a majority of those to their 'vault'.  Its a neat service and protects your account against some really hardcore hacks.
However, when real amounts of money are on the line (depending on the person, that obviously varies), I would consider moving some into cold storage, but let me say this.  If you are investing a large amount of money into bitcoin, you should have the knowledge to handle them properly by that point.  Until then, get comfortable with small amounts of transfers, have a few "freak out" moments wondering when your unconfirmed transaction will go thorugh when you use a wallet and forget to pay transaction fees (which is hard to do nowadays by accident actually), and just make some purchases and have fun with it.  Knowledge comes with use, as does confidence, and when the time comes to hold a couple more bits on your balance sheet, then you can talk about key control and/or key management.

I'm wondering if building additional types of wallets, like multi Sig, that could allow a connection to this party repositories to vote and bid/fund projects and the like, the conditions of the fund transfer could be broadcast and added to the blockchain as script data.  The only problem with all this is what if the project is bullshit, the repository is corrupted, or the nefarious user just sends funds to that wallet from another source to unlock the funds.  As much as I'd love something like this to work it would be very delicate and I'm curious to see the level of decentralisation and security/trust you could really achieve in a situation like this

The bigger picture though, is we need all these "convert to USD" features.  I think of it almost like back in the day when USD's were backed by Gold.

Institutional mining will necessitate higher dumping rates to maintain payment to their fiat masters.  At home miners don't need to sell coin to pay bills, so generally sell pressure isn't as high.  It will get worse.  So it's really a matter of increased demand vs increased sell pressure due to lower margins from miners.

Bashco, you are guilty of a bitcoiner mentality, you can't just start it for afew days andbe like "oh Woe is me it's not catching on", it's got to be maintained and reminded andbabied until it reaches a tipping point where it's naturally on the frontpage every day.  Keep in mind this sub reddit has a lot of peoplethat read it every second, but most people check it on significant price action, or news/drama.  
I say start then up again, see what happens 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:26:08
As someone who has spent about 5 btc on ostk, the only thing Amazon had significantly cheaper was a nice pair of speakers I wanted.  Over stock always beats on household wares like rugs, furniture, bathroom and office supplies.  Electronics arehit or miss depending on the brand.  For instance, last I checked they didn't even sell Bose.  That said, I don't get this accusation of not good prices.  Additionally they send out coupons all the time

We have quite a few experts in this forum that would be more than happy to set him up.  Coinbase and Bitpay both have business Reps in a lot of the US.
Additionally, if he wants to set up he could get our community members involved and they love to support the businesses that accept it.  Many local meetup groups such as the Vancouver BC meetup group have a handful of restaurants that accept it and continue to accept it and they act as a giant "foodie posse" that just roams around to those restaurants.  Its not huge business but its fun, doesn't cost the merchant anything, man... paying with bitcoin is so neat.  I love it hahah.

@_date: 2014-10-28 08:00:39
If she's still not into BTC after that, then is it really massive?  Exposure doesn't mean a whole lot at this point.
Just because I know tor exists, doesn't mean I have an everyday use for it.  The whole world could know Tor exists, and have no reason to download the Tor browser.
Similarly with bitcoin, unless people have a reason to use it in their own lives, exposure is kind of pointless.  Bitcoin growth will be slow and gradual.  Placing faith in a new currency is the ultimate form of trust, and that form of trust isn't earned overnight.  Its earned through years and years of just BEING there and working.  I don't know about you, but if bitcoin was still around 10 years from now, I'd feel a lot more comfortable earning 100% of my salary without converting it than I do now.

We don't need to give people a college education in bitcoin, but we can teach them two things:
1) How to accept bitcoins
2) How to use bitcoins
If they want to participate in more of the community they can check coinmap and talk to other businesses in the area that use/accept it.
We really have to stop having brain vomit coming out when we talk to the average joe about this stuff, certainly, we don't want to make them sorry they asked.

He does bring up good points as far as the the mining centralization being an inherent weakness in the system.  However, I think he ignores the fact that nothing about this system is set in stone, and everything is malleable.  This is living breathing software the changes with the needs of its users.  Also, Ghash is down to like 17% of the network, so..... yeah, this guy is working from old data.... I do think we are still very much still in beta in terms of usability and ironing out the kinks, but I think bitcoin will ultimately prosper, at least in some capacity.  I'm just along for the ride :D, and its been a fun one so far!

We need to build this stuff out slowly.  I've gotten about 7 people in my life (friends and family) to buy bitcoin recently, and even two people to buy an Antminer or use their awesome GPU's to mine with.
So teach people about bitcoin.  Talk to them about it and don't be pushy.  They might find it so interesting they actually buy some bitcoin.  And guess what happens, the next time you talk to them, they'll have more bitcoin than the last time you asked them.  Bitcoin is addicting as hell, so just help get the addiction started :P.  I'd say 1/3 people I give bitcoin to end up buying their own.  Not only does that give me more people to nerd out with, but it creates the snowball to get this stuff out to more and more people.
In the end, screw the merchants.  They will come eventually.

@_date: 2015-05-21 06:30:16
I think you have been drinking the bitcoin kool-aid full speed.  I'd take a step back and look at it from a macro perspective.  Bitcoin is a miraculous technology.  But is it the HD DVD of a market that will naturally phase itself out as ever increasing stop gaps are seen as "good enough", or will it catch on enough to change things.  One thing is for sure, I'm more excited about companies/governments using it as a provable ledger.  I could imagine a legal document 30 years from now "Please reference txid code  on the blockchain for verification" or some shit like that.  Although, the currency, if widely accepted enough, and people not needing to change in and out of it all the time, has huge innate benefits.
Its a brave bet OP, but probably no less than some of the other folks in this sub have sunk into it.  Be careful and good luck!

Holy shit this is a circle jerk in here.   Am I the only that thinks a bottom up approach (community before corporate) is the long term driver of bitcoin?  If people see it as this commodity you are just trying to dump, why would they give it value?  However, if they see it as access to a whole other world, they might be more interested, so long as there is a solid base of users in their area.  Stop pandering to big name merchants and start going to your local meetups.  Talk to some small businesses in your area, but for god sakes can we do something other than Twitter bombing Amazon every two weeks?

An exchange needs to build an API for BTM transactions.  That way, the BTM owner can hold cash in an exchange account, they can buy the BTC from the echange at market rate, and then the exchange pushes down the bitcoin to the user at the end.  This would allow people to not have to worry about the swings in price, and take some speculation out of the game.  Thus fees could be less than %5
We jumped the gun putting these BTM's everywhere and touting them as a savior.  To be sure, their only use is to sell BTC to people who have bad credit or who can't get Coinbase/circle/exchange accounts.

The problem is they have not one customer that will stand behind them.  Taking preorders and giving an estimated delivery date and missing itterriblymultiple times just wreaks up scam.  Granted, they did eventually deliver, but a company without a single happy customer but has exorbitant profit to show for it will go down, and no one will care.  So what ifthe ftc goes after bull shit scammers in the space, things like silk roadgetreplaced by things harder toshut down, and things like bfl get replaced by more honest players, and as a miner in the space, I can tellyou that they most certainly already have and haven't been relevant... Well, really ever, asthey are simply just beat to market every time.  Why?   Probably because they mined with customer hardware before shipping.

Take into account about 10-15% of the world's hashing power comes out of Wenatchee, WA, which has a residential electricity rate of .022 cents per kwh, and a business rate of somewhere in the ballpark of .016-.018 per kwh.  China, which has an estimated 30-60% of the hashrate, is in a similar ballpark.
There are some of us in other parts of WA that still mine (like myself), and other folks that do it for the helluvit, because its still way cheaper than the national average, .06-.08 for instance, but most of your miners that mine at scale mine in areas of cheaper.
Also your price per MW is flawed definitely.  You should be taking the Antminer S5 hashrate and power usage to do your calculations and probably subtracting 10% from that calculation, because again, most miners that mine at scale do it with the latest and greatest shit, and most anything worse than an S3 is off now.
@_date: 2015-05-30 17:30:29
I could see this as a potential problem for mining pills most especially.  A scenario I have in my head is that, what if mining pools themselves generate a bunch of bogus transactions in order to get this unconfirmed status up really high, assuring feeless transactions are not propagated.  Right now the block reward is more significant, but this could put a 1-5 year timeline (less if bitcoin has more significant price action) on getting this done.  We shouldn't depend on this being "difficult" to pull off, but come up with a more streamlined solution.  Side chains still seem like an interesting way to handle micro transactions to mitigate this potential even further.  Couple that with block size increase and we've made the network more resilient, but part of me just feels that those are intrinsically both sub par solutions to the problem, despite me thinking both will be an eventuality anyway...

Its a matter of DMCA compliance is really all the problem was from what I've read.  In the early days of youtube, DMCA compliance was, and still by and large is, a huge issue.  Youtube has a set number of videos they must take down to stay compliant, which as you might have guessed, is no where NEAR the number of videos on there illegally.  Its estimated almost 90-95% of the videos on youtube are illegal, but what are they going to do about it?  Most companies have stopped caring for all but contracting out DMCA Agents for newly released content.    For example, if you made a playlist for the new purity ring album right on its release, your playlist would be 75% dead by morning.  Give it a month, your whole album might make it.
Youtube was able to muscle its way through this pain with the help of the Google umbrella.  Not every company has that luxury.  If sites like youtube that are way smaller have to hire a slough of Legal/compliance and customer service agents to comply with then how in the FUCK are we ever going to get strong competition to youtube?  The answer:  WE WON'T.   This is the same logic as this whole bitlicense bullshit.
Don't try and act like this is the same as robbing a bank.  It isn't.  This isn't as cut and dry as "bad guy bad, put in jail - take assets".

I think even if a different digital currency ends up being the mainstay, bitcoin will always have value. 
Think 50 years from now. 
* How much will a block of 50 bitcoins mined from the coinbase into a wallet be worth?
* How much will bitcoins that have never touched an exchange be worth?
* How much will a bitcoin mined in 2010 be worth?
* How much will Lealana and Cassacius coins be worth?
* How much will prefork bitcoins be worth?
* How much will Bitcoins that Satoshi could have owned be worth?
* How much will some bitcoins be worth after some of the OG bitcoiners are long dead be worth? Think about people tracing back Hal Finney or some of the 10,000 bitcoins that were used in the Pizza transaction. Block explorers are only going to get better with time and arbitrary values to these types of coins will exist even if other cryptos take the  spot. Even in 50 years if Bitcoin is  on the coinmarketcap chart, it'll still be a 10-100 trillion+ $ market cap. That I'm almost certain.

I think Sam Cole might be vastly underestimating just how cheap things are in China, especially if you are already an established businessman (who can navigate prices better than foreigner) with factory ties.
That said, you aren't wrong that they haven't in all likelyhood turned much profit selling mining equipment, but neither have the WinkleVoss twins.... they are all just playing the long game. It's not their fault that every other mining equipment company was an actual scam.
Be that as it may that this mining hardware is centralized by one maker, but be grateful that mining isn't completely centralized by one or two big companies at this point. Be grateful that home mining is still mildly viable!

This is how you know you haven't been in bitcoin very long. Not 2-3 weeks ago someone said ethereum would never trade below $100 again. 3 days later I picked some up for $95 on the Korean exchanges. Don't get me wrong, I'm bullish for 5-10k this year or next, but I would not at all be surprised if some hype on ethereum caused the flippening, all the sudden bitcoin cash's hash rate goes bananas, or some Korean or Chinese regulator causes huge panic. Or maybe two months from now blocks are full again and on/off chain solutions take another 2-5 years to develop and newbs get impatient. 
There are a lot more reasons for the main bitcoin chain to get wrecked now than ever. I'd rate bitcoin a : HODL, right now, but I sold half my stack at 3k and this relief rally has me a little bummed that I didn't hit the top, but I'd be very surprised if we hit 10k before we hit 2k again.

OP, do a search for thinkgeek and limit it to this sub.  Their products are garbage mostly, and instead of harassing Online merchants, you'd be better off talking to local businesses you already know.  if your intent is to buy products, shop elsewhere.  If your intent is to "help bitcoin", you'd do better off explaining it to close friends, and maybe giving a small amount to a friend.  It's all about public perception, and the reality is bitcoins image is like shell after the gulf spill.  It's just going to take time and convincing folks 1 by 1 of its utility.  If you don't have any professional skills to offer the ecosystem (i.e. programming) then that's really the best you can do!

I don't think we'll get to that point, and I hope we never do.  Having everyone be able to jump into the game with a potentially reasonable return with a single s5 is where we are at now.  For a couple hundred bucks you could get into mining that outpaces power cost in most cities.  Full node and a terrahash is what every bitcoiner should be rocking

I'm surprised you've gotten a to the moon vibe... especially lately.  Are you sure you didn't take like a 6-18 month break from when you first read this sub to when you posted this post?
For your latter comment; free markets will do what they will do, and currencies are inherantly unstable.  Look at the Euro a year ago vs what it was today.  Look at the Canadian dollar 6 months ago vs what it is today against its USD pairs.  Currency, like anything else in a free market, can be wildly volatile, to the point where our neighbors to the north (im a US citizen) will import from AUstralia and pay import tax because the exchange rate is better.
skyrocketing valuations may or may not ever happen again, but what i can tell you is that nothing is to stop bitcoin from going to $1000 coin tomorrow, just as there isn't much stopping it from going to $150 a coin tomorrow.
Both cases are extraordinarily unlikely, but markets will do whatever they want, contrary to another post made here today, bitcoin IS like honeybadger, it gives no fucks.

People in this sub are so delusional sometimes it's unreal.  We need to stop treating bitcoin than this larger than life thing.  At this stage in the game we have to picture bitcoin like a fat girlfriend who is rich, smart, good in the sack, and everything you want her to be.  She very well may be the perfect woman, but when you tout her around your arm saying shit like "i can't believe she didn't win the beauty pageant" not only are you annoying and delusional af, you're missing the point entirely.  You really have to get to know bitcoin on the inside before you know how amazing it is, that's our job, she's our fat girlfriend.

This actually makes a lot of sense.  Heartland bought Chockstone in 2008 and Chockstone bought peppercoin in 2007, which was an internet micro payment platform that preceded bitcoin by a few years.  This was something I was just researching recently for acompletely unrelated reason.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:00:03
has anyone looked into the peppercoin creators (bought out in 2007) are somehow related to the bitcoin creation?  I've been looking into this and some stars seem to align.  Any theories of Silvio Micali or Rivest being Satoshi, and the reason for the secrecy was simply an NDA or so their employers don't try and get a piece of that pie?  
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:29:12
Hey guys, so I've noticed a lot of new people around here lately, so I decided to throw a link up to show people some bitcoin history. The story of bitcoin is old, complex, emotional, full of disagreements, distrust, scammers, idealists, hackers, businessmen, traders, and just plain enthusiasts.
When I think of Bitcoin I think of all the amazing tech, the money, the HODLs the Bearwhale, the bubbles of crazy heights, but more than that I think of relationships in the community, and people I grew to respect. I think of my first transaction and how novel the feeling was and how scared I was to typo the address (not knowing what a checksum was). Sending .1 BTC to a dice site and feeling like an outlaw, and promptly losing it all. 
Bitcoin was my life for years, and not checking the price every second and worrying about which solution will be the best in the end was the best thing I did almost a year ago now.
That said, over the coming weeks, I hope to post more things like this to just give newbies a taste of where we came from (as bitcoiners) and a little bit about what our history is really like. If you don't already know who Hal Finney is, you owe it to yourself to give this thread a read. Make sure your tissues are armed and ready, you'll need um.
Anyway, my point is, there is more to bitcoin than just prices and transactions, just like there is more to a language than grammar and vocabulary. Like languages, bitcoin is rich in history, change, and life. I hope you enjoy these little posts I'll be doing from time to time, hoping they don't get buried in the noise :).

The problem is there needs to be a physical place that sells bitcoin for cash without a bajillion percent markup so businesses CAN actually utilize the lower fee structure.  Unless companies just have a bitcoin balance that they are willing to bare the volatility with then it just won't fly in most use cases, especially with large entities transferring 10-20 million sums.

Awesome, I just think that should be the protocol with coinbase employees and other companies in this space, hell you could even prove it cryptographically.  Show people "yo, I am from coinbase, here is proof", "alright, now take me seriously".
On that note, I guess here is a tentative welcome to the team Rosey, even though all we have is Michael's vetting, but coinbase should know better by now as almost every one of your employees gets this same scrutiny when posting here.  It could all be avoided easily with a solution above.  A solution that wouldn't require our mods to vet every new employee.

Just so you know, this is unlikely to be caused from your friend's son's transaction with circle, lest he got his circle account banned and they wanted to trace them down.  There is no way to check on-chain that those coins were the same ones that were sent.  A typical web wallet to web wallet transaction looks like this:
Funds in your account/address = 0, regardless of what is actually there.  Coinbase/circle move these to cold storage in order to protect themselves and you, so:
Step 1)  Coinbase sends funds to Circle address via "Hot Wallet".
Step 2) Circle receives funds, and does the same thing, placing them into cold storage.
Step 3) Person spends from Circle wallet, the funds are sent from their Warm storage as well, of which there is no way to tell which coins are yours and theirs.
Thus, it was not from your most recent transaction.  Think of your other transactions that you may have had.  The best thing to do is to do all your spending from an on-chain wallet, and not a web wallet.  As a general explanation as to why, see below:
To you and as a PSA to Others: Some have recommended mixers/washer, but if you want privacy and you don't want to seem like you are trying to hide your actions, just use HD wallets, shared send on the occassion, or Darkwallet.  Don't use mixing services, those are just scams invented to take paranoid people's money, plus, they aren't going to save your ass in court if you are buying mass quantities of illicit goods.  A good lawyer will deck your ass with a guilty by association charge.

Bitcoin is a fun asset to trade, although the whales control the market, but they don't do it with 0 knowledge of human psychology or market cycles.  Head over to and follow their trades for a little bit.  Its definitely an interesting asset to trade, especially right now.  A lot of talk about the bottom being in, or perhaps is down another $80-150 or so.  But either way, it feels like a good time to try and trade this asset.  Too much VC money in to let it die, but the regular get rich quicks are dying off.  So give it a shot, just don't try trading on leverage on your first couple months of trading.

Although I've made a pretty penny trading ethereum the past few weeks (as you can see by my moonkid like enthusiasm in my post history) , but how many ethereum am I holding? Last I checked like a dozen or so? 
Although to be fair, I think bitcoin is going to take a beating in the short term. I've sold out of over half of my holdings in btc because the risk reward in the whole crypto space is feeling bad. Ethereum bubble, bitcoin political drama. 
Although I do feel bitcoin is certainly the safest crypto to hold, you'd be a fool not to add the good old USD back into your portfolio, maybe with some index funds to go with it. BIP148 may still fail, and there is only so long bitcoiners will tolerate 2-5$ transaction fees.

Ah that's awesome, I actually believe I sent an email on this a couple weeks ago, or was trying to.  I remember thinking about it when I downloaded elementary then anyway.  I quite like it, though I'm comfortable with mint and cinnamon as my desktop experience, I have elementary virtual boxed as my test box to play with weird software.  I would recommend this to a college student too poor to replace their Mac book pro but still wants a pretty seamless experience.  Throwing this on a nonarm chrome book for $250 is quite the little pricing magic trick

If your investment target is 10 years, I'd wait a month for a potential discount. Even if bitcoin's scaling problem gets sorted short term, I don't see is going above 5k. But if it has a hiccup, revisiting sub 2k levels is more than possible since we are on borrowed money up to this bubble to begin with. Be patient. FOMO never pays off in this market

1) If you sell as a maker, in most exchanges there arent fees. 
2) pay your taxes people, Jesus Christ. 10% is a small price to pay for an investment that has 10xed or more.  If you're selling 2-3 coins, sure, of course you can just sell them locally, buy things with them, and the like, but if you're selling a large amount, don't become an audit target. If you lie to the IRS once, you'll have high fines and be an audit target for the rest of your life. And for what? A few thousand bucks? Not worth the risk man. Anyone selling large amounts of bitcoin and doesn't also have a large income is going to run an audit risk, and despite their current understaffed nature, IRS ain't nothing to fuck with.

This is why I sold my eth. Whales are going to eat your gains. If you've only been in crypto a few months, welcome. I too made money on both bitcoin and ether. Currently I'm sold out of 60% of btc and 95% of my ether. I'm thinking the next few weeks will show you what a crash looks like. Personally, I have two limit orders set for eth at 278 and 238. I'd be amazed if both of those didn't get filed by the end of the month

Had nothing to do with it. I can speak for the Korean case because I live here. Foreigners are afraid to lose their visas due to unusual banking activity. If you want to wire anything more than 50000 a year out, it requires a ton of paperwork and explaining what you are doing. Also, Since, in Korea, most tax experts would say bitcoin is a digital asset, it's sale would be taxed at 10%. 
So the answer is when the prices were really out of wack it was a great way to make a few extra grand for the long term holders. Now though, the spread would need to be at least 15-20% to cover wire fees, taxes, and the like... And that doesn't even count the potential tax bourdon on the other end, in the case of the U.S., you'd be taxed there too after a certain point, or depending on your residency status in the other country (330 day test). Needless to say arbitrage trading makes yourself a huge target.
So the tldr is that currency controls in these countries are tight, and evening out the spread will take a long time of little bites by holders who have bank accounts in both, or by some otc sales

Omg fucking finally. After what happened last night, I can't hang with Gdax until they fix their scaling problems. What should have been an easy scalp in ethereum last night turned into a flash crash because everything went down. Ugh

This is why I have extra passwords on both my bank and my phone account. I used to work for a mobile provider. Social Engineering is a thing.
