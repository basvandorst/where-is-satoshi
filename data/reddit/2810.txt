It is not as bad as you think, no id verification or anything like that. I have to admit I was thrown when blockchain stopped accepting uk deposits, but I'm glad I went to the effort to buy some when I did (about a week ago now).

It is hard to calculate, all things taken into consideration, as the difficulty is going up at such a huge rate.

Cool, where did you buy this stuff?

Good post, this is an issue I think the Bitcoin community sidesteps, ostensibly because the advent of quantum computers would affect a lot of different financial institutions (credit/debit cards included).
Quantum computers are likely to become reality one day, it will be interesting to see if Bitcoin will be able to overcome this (by some change to the protocol) or perhaps whether some other altchain that implements quantum-resistant public key crypto will take its place.

Yeah, you need a bitstamp account first so you can get their deposit address and reference. Good luck! :)

This is happening to me also, I took back ups though

what would count as "pro-Bitcoin" legislation?

I had a similar problem, blockchain stopped accepting UK deposits only a couple of days before I was able to buy any large amount :(
I would recommend transferring money through Transferwise to bitstamp, thats how I bought my current bitcoin. I converted my £ to euros on transferwise, then deposited it through SEPA at bitstamp which then converted it to $, before finally(!) converting it to bitcoin. Only took a few days, I did pay a ~£10 expedited delivery fee though on transferwise.

Haha, I should have put legal in the title. Well its no longer just Silk Road that accepts BTC anymore :)

Thanks, confirmed what I was thinking, I will probably just invest in buyimg bitcoins outright and possibly some associated services.

It will be interesting to see what alternative blockchains will appear in coming years. Bitmessage is an interesting example of an altchain for sending encrypted messages. I am at odds with your last paragraph though, doesn't the voting power in a blockchain lie with computing power rather than individual nodes?

Interesting idea, but bitcoin should develop inherent value of its own, not be backed by fiat.

How long did this montage take?
