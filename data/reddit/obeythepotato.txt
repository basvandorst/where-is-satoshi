carefully i would suggest you think about investing some now and some later "if" it goes down. I wanted to buy when it was in the 900s just this year some months ago. I told myself I would wait for the price to go down and now I missed that boat..
This is not like stocks where you can wait for the dip and expect one, there are no analytics to be sure of in a big measure like that.
Also take in mind that if you have never bought one , there is a setup process that could take some time and some places put limits on daily buys,etc
Good luck

Hi there new redditor here, i didn't buy when it was sub 1000 USD because i did not have the $, but next week im getting some funds. What do you guys gals think?
Did I miss the boat? Or should i buy as soon as i get the funds?(or when is it a good time to buy?) Im going to use coinbase then transfer it to a trenzor wallet ( im really new this is what i understood i had to do or did i miss something/can do something better?)
P.D Around how much do you think it will be in mid 2018 or 2020? Im about to put almost all the funds im getting from a RIP relative ( it isn't much but all disposable i have, im very young)
Thank you , may bitcoin make all your wildest dreams come true :P!

Hi im a good time follower of this subreddit and have learned a lot from your sharing. I created a reddit account now just because of this, this is my first post :). Some months ago when Bitcoin was at sub 1000 USD I could not afford it.
Sadly I missed a nice profit now thats nearing 3300?
On the good side im receiving some funds next week for to buy some coins. So I wanted to ask:
Do you think am i still on time to ride the boat?
Im going to use coinbase then transfer it to a trenzor wallet. What do you think of this?
Should i risk it and wait the coin to go down or just buy the coins with all my disposable cash instead of buying stocks bonds etc?
Many thanks for all the contributions all or most of you did on reddit,i learned a lot but im still very young and have doubts so i wanted to hear some of your opinions.
P.D how much do you think it will be worth on 2018 or 2020 and what do you think of buying 1 or 2 ethernet ones? Thank you!

Pardon my ignorace fellow bitcoiners, how will this affect the price of Bitcoin?

Obviously this is completely fake, REPORTED.
I was there yesterday and they don't do anything just play with some accounts owned by the same person to get subscribers and then sell subs or gets adds.

Hey, yes, the way to avoid those fees is to buy person to person if you can find people who want to (forums, maybe localbitcoin,etc) Otherwise you can learn to use exchanges and it can potentially be much lower. Also why did you transfer it from coinbase to coinomi! I mean they do offer these wallets but its not completely secure since hackers can check the logs and typing etc. Also fees in coinbase vary a lot depending on payment methods and currencty, USD and bank transfers are cheaper than  other currency with credit or other forms i think. 
I would suggest you buy a trezor or similar hardwallet device and transfer there.
