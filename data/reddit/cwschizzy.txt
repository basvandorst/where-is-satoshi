Nope. They have always been prompt and straightforward with me. 
Make sure your have a two way authentication to help prevent outside hacking though.

I was just about to say the same. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:51:51
15 pennies. That's it. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:47:14
Fuck. I bought yesterday. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:30:22
Wow! That's.....an oddly specific business.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:11:46
Neat concept. I hope it takes off.
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:20:11
I dream of the day I'm big enough that I can be the failure.
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:33:46
One day we will rule the world! Or modestly sized suburbs. Whoo!
And thanks. I squealed like a schoolgirl. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:10:19
That's so mean! Trust me, if there was one around or I had BTC to withdraw, I'd do it...asshole. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 04:48:50
Yup. If I had the capital to start buying, this would be the time. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:22:54
Nice, man. I just bought my first .05 too. As a broke college kid, I'm immensely excited. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:25:50
This is cool, but I'd rather just poop in a box and hide it in his car. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:38:26
Whenever they do, 1200 EST. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 05:48:48
This sounds awesome. Tip-in-Top sounds fun. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 17:21:31
Splendid cake day, argh. Jolly Roger be wantin' a corner slice!
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:58:34
They take it from your bank. It's your purchase with .15 tacked on. So yes, you get the whole dollar in BTC. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 04:42:21
That moment when I almost put that information in. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:36:55
I use them, they're alright. They take 15 per every buy or sell you make, which is next to nothing. 
I totally recommend them. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:23:20
They need to be *extremely* careful to not royally screw this up. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:24:15
My poverty has been steadily eradicated by incremental purchases of BTC. I am now wealthy. Good job, cwschizzy. You earned it. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 16:54:15
Unchain yourself from earthly tethers. Enter the void. Empty, and become wind. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:45:03
Remember, remember the fifth of November
Gunpowder, treason and plot.
I see no reason, why gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot.
Guy Fawkes, guy, t'was his intent 
To blow up king and parliament. 
Three score barrels were laid below 
To prove old England's overthrow. 
By God's mercy he was catch'd 
With a darkened lantern and burning match. 
So, holler boys, holler boys, Let the bells ring. 
Holler boys, holler boys, God save the king.
And what shall we do with him? 
Burn him!
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:38:19
What an oddly specific feat. 
Awesome job man. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:46:21
What a nice surprise.
