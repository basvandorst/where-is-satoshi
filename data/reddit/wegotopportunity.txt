It was said in this video that the volitility of Bitcoin has gone down over time. Has anyone actually synthesized the data and proved this?
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:53:04
You could add the EFF. IIRC they accept BTC.

Circlejerk smoke. Don't breathe this.

Just throw the dice in the same pattern as before.

OP justs has a super high shutter speed camera.

I was planning on buying one of the $150 boards, but doing that would just allow me to keep my .1BTC per day
@_date: 2012-10-21 15:46:41
So then no one will be able to mine with a standard GPU.
@_date: 2012-10-20 23:44:36
1.5 TeraHashes/s?
Wouldn't that make you $174,444.59 a month?
This could easily be the end of bitcoin.

Isn't bitcoin fiat?
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:58:23
Of or @_date: 2013-12-29 20:09:14
1262 BTC
@_date: 2013-03-22 11:08:04
Yeah, I had the same immediate first thought. The US Dollar hasn't been a commodity-backed currency for decades now, and in fact (IIRC) the majority of currencies worldwide are fiat.

Wouldn't Silk Road's hoard be encrypted?

What are you saying?
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:33:32
What kind of gear?
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:21:47
Doesn't fiat mean without intrinsic value in this scenario? As in: Not commodity or commodity-backed?

"I don't understand it so I'm afraid of it."
Hopefully when this guy gets educated on Bitcoins he comes less foolish.

Fair Enough

IIRC Milton Friedman is indirectly responsible for the deaths of many Chileans.
@_date: 2013-05-03 00:23:00
How would someone do that?
@_date: 2013-06-30 23:11:54
Yes but it doesn't necessarily need to be correct. Although it's probably illegal for it not to be.
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:08:35
Interesting how the US isn't even on this list.
@_date: 2013-03-03 17:35:42
Actually, at this point deflation is problematic. Instability is bad for a currency. It would be best for BTC to hold its current exchange ratio than to go up to $40/BTC.

Better yet: cheap PCI-e FPGA cards
@_date: 2013-03-19 00:13:52
This is ridiculous. Thinking about how I could have bought BTC at $40 just a few weeks ago and already made a 25% profit is insane.

Truer words have never been spoken.
@_date: 2013-03-03 16:45:28
Thanks for this response. What Anenome5 said didn't make sense according to what I've been taught about Macroeconomics.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:03:20
@_date: 2013-08-18 03:57:04
More importantly people don't understand it, so it scares them
@_date: 2013-03-22 11:05:20
Any proof?
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:17:58
God forbid they figure out a large amount of their customers want to pay them in bitcoin. Then they just might start accepting it.
@_date: 2013-04-30 01:48:47
Is bitcoin ready to go mainstream?
Maybe the influx of people will force it to be.
@_date: 2013-05-20 02:47:46


Wow, there's a forum for almost anything.
I remember some guys on OCN found out about a flashlight enthusiasts forum a while back.
@_date: 2013-03-03 05:25:24
I don't understand the point of this bank. 
Why would you store your bitcoins there?
But more importantly, this defies the purpose of a bank. They make no loans. All bitcoins are just held in one place. Nothing happens to them, and no one makes any interest.


If I'm understanding correctly, this guy is upset that banks don't have a reserve requirement of 100%, which makes no sense and defeats the purpose of a bank.
@_date: 2013-05-20 03:12:43
What would someone discuss on a gold and silver forum?
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:57:25
I'd guess that it's because doubling the hashing is a cheap way to increase the difficulty of brute-forcing the input.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:39:35
Oh, so you generate an encrypted version of the text with the private key, and then prove the owner used the private key using the public key?
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:06:18
Both wikipedia and my Macroecon 101 class say that fiat currency can be money simply with no intrinsic value, not money necessarily backed by a government.
@_date: 2013-06-23 17:49:34
I wish I knew how to do this...

Mega gives you 50GB of storage for free.

CC companies charge them, so it wouldn't cost more IMO to use BTC.
As someone under the age of 18, I love bitcoin not for anonymity, but for its decentralization and lack of regulation. I can much more easily pay for Steam games with BTC than USD.

Depends how early those coins were minted

What happened to these people with their 10,000 BTC? Rolling in the dough?
@_date: 2013-07-03 22:59:33


Then why use PayPal? Or a bank?
Even before digital currencies banks have been making up money. Pretend made-up non-existent money isn't scarce at all.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:27:51
For non-steam games you should probably change this, then:

For all I know you could be a part of a conspiracy
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:14:08
Is it custom?
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:59:08
Seems like a scam to me. They're offering Minecraft steam codes. There is no such thing.

And all I've got is pocket change

This is what I like about bitcoin.
