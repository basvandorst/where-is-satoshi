Not sure what you use, but on blockchain it doesn’t even cost me $10 to send $600 right now
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:07:39
It’s probably already done. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:00:00
Get a 1tb or even 4tb if you want and use paragon to clone the drive 
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:27:52
Get an accountant. 
They will have to factor in electricity, amount of space it takes (home office) gains/losses and much more
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:04:46
Because I want more bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:31:05
If it’s still worth $50 I can send you like a $30 pizza gift card if you wanna make a deal like that 
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:29:34
Except a hacker can’t kill you
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:19:54
Buy from Coinbase and transfer to something like Blockchain 
If your going to invest large amounts like $1,000+ then I’d recommend a paper wallet or nano s
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:31:12
Yes but the account doesn’t require any personal info, you could just make a fake name when signing up
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:40:42
Or he got on a phishing site...
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:44:49
Even though most bitcoin atms take your license and a picture...
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:31:48
Litecoin and ethereum. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:25:00
So anyone wanna make a contract, I send it to a German, German sends me direct wire of the value?
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:39:24
I guarantee you, Korean, US, Canadian, Chinese, and probably the Israeli governments have huge mining operations going on. They would be stupid not to. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:14:13
Clone it to another hard drive in case it’s failing, and so you have a backup
On the clone use a dictionary or brute force attack, if neither work and you don’t know the password you’re out of luck
Dictionary attacks are faster, brute force can take days if not years, depending on how complex the password is
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:47:05
How much? I might buy it
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:54:46
Sure you can. Go to a random number/letter generator. Heads you win, tails you have to send all your bitcoin to the address and hope it doesn’t exist 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:19:29
Blockchain has a phone wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:11:32
So just cancel and resend
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:37:44
True. If you want real anonymity a blockchain account and paying cash via local bitcoins would be your best bet but even then they can still catch you
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:15:01
It’s more of a nerd thing. Like for example, my graphics card and case fans came with lights for no extra cost, so I set them up as red and blue to look like the same color as red and blue lightsabers since I love Star Wars. 
I also have an LED strip in front of my windows where my computer is so I can see at night without having a bright light on
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:31:42
If you think that’s bad imagine the USA dude. If people really want to influence the world they need control of America, not South Korea. 
Really makes you wonder why the last few presidents have promised such good things and then never went through with them until we got Trump, someone who’s not in it for the money
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:38:32
I’d love to shop with him. 
“Do you accept bitcoin”
“Alright have fun Mr. Olegovich. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:29:12
Wouldn’t that be hilarious if part of the peace deal between north and south was to spread FUD so north could buy a shit ton of crypto and then sell after it rises again so they can get out of debt 
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:18:20
Paypal goods and services? I’d be willing to buy and under the descripion we can both put my address (the receiving) and your address (the sender)
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:46:46
He’s rich. He knows technology and secrets we’ll never see in our lifetime. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:08:37
Still probably made more returns than bitcoin would have given him 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:12:15
Lol just wait until the banks start using it
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:56:16
What I came here to say. People make smartphones sound so secure but the truth is they constantly add new features. The more features, the easier to break new code. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:34:36
Do you play fortnite? You seem like the kinda guy who gets on squads at 2am high as fuck
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:08:04
Closer to 5, but either way, it’s a correction if it drops from 19k to 13-15k but for it to drop over 10k is a crash, not a correction. And when something like this crashes that’s when even the strong “holders” get weak hands and sell. And once they sell the price plummets even more until it reaches 0. 
If more places actually accepted bitcoin there would be a reason to by more but as of now it has NO USE. It’s purely an investment. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:12:13
Ah thanks for the useful insight. Ripple actually has a purpose and is partnered with banks. What does bitcoin have? Nothing. Everyone’s out now because of how ducking manipulatable and volatile it is. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:45:46
What do you mean smart money?
How do you know it’s going to continue to dip, I barely have any bitcoin at all, most of my crypto is in ripple, would you say to take my money out of that since they’re partnering with banks already?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:14:51
Oh, I read it as “if you don’t understand, hodl” instead of “if you don’t understand hodl...”
Still, neither correlate. You can’t hold if bitcoin has no value and is volatile. How are businesses or online retailers supposed to adopt if even after fast and cheap transactions are made possible, the coin is still insanely, if not more volatile. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:48:34
You’re also a liar. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:58:58
When did you buy, and how much have you made or lost. If you don’t want to give a price, give percentages 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:00:14
Not sure if that last part was directed toward me or not, but that’s pretty much what I said. Nobody hopped on the bitcoin train for the tech, unless you were a super super early investor
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:03:39
Who said I’ve been 3 months in? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:53:44
Did you not read my post? I said I didn’t invest what I couldn’t lose. Meaning I don’t care if it goes to zero, I just want to know what the fuck is happening. 
People hopped on the train to profit, but the tech is why people stayed after they bought, until now. How can ANYONE invest in ANYTHING that can go from $12,000 to $19,000 to $8,000 within a few months? It’s so unpredictable it’s stupid, and if people don’t start buying again, this is going to be the end of the beloved bitcoin this sub circlejerks about. 
Fucking wake up and admit when you lose and get rid of the shitty hodl meme. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:38:02
No, I actually don’t even care, if I did I would’ve sold. I just want to know what’s going on, and it shows how stupid people in this sub are. 
Wanting to know why a consistent dip that’s been happening for over a month now is even happening is panicking?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:01:19
Ok have fun when bitcoin reaches 0 because you take the “hodl” meme too seriously and never sell
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:38:44
How? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:16:45
Bitcoin was created in an anti-bank kinda way but that’s not relevant if the price doesn’t even stay consistent. 
If people want to make bitcoin their personal “bank” then it’s going to change
If I put $1,000 in an actual bank and leave it, it’ll be $1,000 a month from now
If I put $1,000 in bitcoin and leave it, it could be anywhere from $0 to $10,000 in a month. That’s not anything anyone wants. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:02:04
Ok, that’s completely different, I’m referring to people who bought it, in the past 2-3 years, not people who mined it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:37:04
I didn’t lose anything. I haven’t sold. I’m asking what the duck is going on. 
Investment - “to allocate money in the expectation of some benefit in the future”
It’s an investment. As I said nobody buys bitcoin for the tech. They buy it to make money. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:11:04
Read the last sentence. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:10:11
I’m was here for both. Places like steam and Microsoft, and even local shops used to accept bitcoin and now everyone stopped because of the extreme volatility, and there’s no use for bitcoin besides as an investment anymore.
