Basically it may have actually become the first real world Bitcoin killing in early 2017.  But it ended without incident.

Yeah I would rather believe Kleiman was the inventor.  Usually the one that says he is the one who invented it is most likely a liar when there is no proof of the inventor from the beginning.  I would believe Kleiman who is a programmer invented it.  Some complex stuff goes into Bitcoin, your average normal human persons mind can't possibly invent something as mathematically complex as Bitcoin in year 2009 when most people were not tech savvy and smart phones were barely taking traction while PC power was still not the best with just Core 2 Duo processors that.

I can't believe I had stored a paperwallet PDF in Gmail thinking Google was high security and no employee would ever see it.  That Paperwallet had $80K in Ripple XRP at one point, but I moved it to Gatehub.  Whewww close call lol, I was about to become another SOL, but I got lucky no Google employee caught on.

He uses passwords and emails from database breaches to fool people into believing him since he shows their current or past passwords.
