Don't bother. It isn't that big of a deal. Tits are tits.
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:27:51
Every number they list is in English (arabic numerals).
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:26:41
Works fine for me!
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:35:46
Can confirm. 73 investors with a combined goal of 20 million and some change.
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:49:58
That's stupid advice, and would have to improve just to be wrong. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:08:47
You can stop putting it together. Don't want to see it.
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:20:50
If there was money to be earned from mining with their products, they would keep them.
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:30:00
If you have PDFs, why the requirement for money to change hands?
I assure you your literature is not of sufficient quality to command a price.

It's over 800 again!

I've made like 15 bucks off karma redemption across multiple accounts. Bitcointip is awesome.
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:33:08
You can send me some and support science.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:27:42
Yes. I'd pay 0.001 BtC.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:04:40
Thanks! I'll look into that.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:08:11
I'm having trouble scanning that address to even donate.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:48:51
You can just send it to my wallet address, since we won't be seeing each other this Christmas.
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:47:36
You probably shouldn't have done that.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:03:53
Thanks for answering!
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:46:36
I'll cover the fee.... he did give me 99c. 
I tried to specify it was for a wallet test. I figured its more than faucets, but less than expensive!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:40:33
So, you get the amount of BtC at time of purchase! Sorry, crappy phone.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:00:06
You can absolutely buy empty calories for cheaper than ones that come along with nutrition! I can elaborate if you are interested.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:00:46
Look at it now vs when it was less than a dollar. Big increases!
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:02:49
We could buy 51% of their company, and use our controlling interest to force the issue.
I have $12.76 USD in checking/saving I am willing to commit to this!
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:07:18
Bitdazzle is easy to use.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:14:05
I see! Ill look into that.
Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:45:20
Yup. I think it was just a sell off to turn the profit back into BtC and run it back up.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:17:58
What's the best way to get started? Faucets are sooooo slow!
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:11:18
Even if it's only useful for buying drugs, it's still pretty useful.
That's like a trillion dollar world-wide economy.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:51:33
I think once 60% of people have and use them, they will be mainstream.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:06:48
I hate how the exchanges are locked into the ask/bid model. I'd prefer the price of last sell/buy model... then you could just buy a satoshi for a few dollars, wait a few seconds then sell!
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:17:13
I find any StarCraft tournament that doesn't include me to be rather suspicious. Kind of like a physics-bee that doesn't have Hawking.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:52:26
Is bitcoin tip easy enough to figure out, from a recipients point of view?
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:06:59
Stop investing money you need... If you can't afford to lose it, you can't afford to invest it.
You should put the money you have toward rent and bills, and explain to the creditors that you'll have the rest ASAP.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:34:27
That could also work, but not as effectively as dangling their job security in front of them if they don't play nice.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:37:33
eBay made me set it to 99c... I was thinking much less than that.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:46:49
Tis but a flesh wound!
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:59:01
News that results in explosive increases in market value and actual value is good news. That's why China is good news. Look beyond the obvious, simple-minded cause and affect, and focus on reality. 
China dumps BtC.... India buys BtC. The marker already believes BtC are worth 1000+. Indians will buy them at that.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:07:23
Your pizza has touched dong before, I hope you realize.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:41:29
People yelling crash, causing a ruckus
BtC aint nothing to F wit!

"Proving" a protein structure is correct would require some very expensive wet-lab science. Proving that the hash has been solved can be done with a hand calculator.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:56:14
I don't like gambling when there is a buy-in.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:28:57
Look at it once a month... Would that help?
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:40:22
I mean they have a pool of bitcoins, I spin the wheel. If I win, I get BTC. If I lose, I get nothing. One play per 24 hrs or something.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:07:46
I meant for investments. A good rule of thumb is only invest what you can afford to lose!
As a grad student, I can't afford to lose much but I have certainly been buying up as many small chunks of BtC as I can.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:40:23
I use that (just did for you).... but sometimes you want more.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:03:37
I sold it for 99cents. So I turned a tiny profit.... of course, the guy hasn't paid yet so I am still waiting.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:50:39
Do multiple transactions... as long as no deposit is above 10K it shouldn't be too suspicious.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:51:03
I agree!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:39:32
A the time of Purchase. I'm a new coinbase customer, and both times took about 4 business days, but they honored price at execution, not delivery!
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:57:18
Supply and demand.
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:19:56
Coinbase credited me 0.5 BtC for pointing this out to them just now, and they say they will address it soon!
Probably just a hush payment.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:37:09
I think its funny... its also a convenient way to express that you approve of a comment without needing access to a limited resource like cryptocurrency or USD (for gold).
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:08:15
You can send a micro transaction plus a dollar. Problem solved.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:46:45
To the moon!
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:03:19
Oh wow! Those things are really cool. I want one.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:54:26
India will more than cover the loss of China.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:56:13
Would that confirm quickly? 
That actually makes sense though. I'm out the same either way, might as well give him more.
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:28:03
50 pence?
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:19:41
Party like it's 2013!
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:07:53
Why, thank you! :-D
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:41:47
Here is a direct address to use  for donating BtC.
(To whoever holds the address, not MPP)
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:09:12
Talking with redditors opened my eyes to both of those things! I'm learning a ton about both.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:00:33
Fiat dollars will decrease in value, for sure! BtC is safer than fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:53:49
Dogecoin is better than Litecoin! Equivalent usefulness and scrypt based mining, more humor. The balance is in favor of the Doge.
Such coin.
Much Scrypt.
So Amaze.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:29:37
If everyone on Reddit sold, I wonder if that would affect the price.
We need a running tally of how many coins redditors have.
I have 0.1467261. A paltry amount.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:13:41
Ahhh... interesting. I will look into that!
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:06:31
Hey! I was thinking about inventing one of those for desks. I think I'll call it a calculator.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:51:15
Literotica.com.... free and better.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:39:25
Much buy before world ends. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:44:48
10$... buy one, get another for the same price.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:47:13
THANK YOU! If you can't afford to lose it, you can't afford to invest it. Sage advice.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:41:36
To..... China?
Too soon?
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:34:28
I'm not sure if it still listed, as I only listed one. This was my first ever sale on eBay. It sold for 99c though.. I made an imgur album of the view I see when I follow the link.
The description was : I am selling 0.00001 Bitcoin. This small amount is good for testing a new wallet, or just as a novel gift for Christmas!If you buy one, please include the Bitcoin address in a note to me. Make absolutely certain that your address is accurate! Once I send the BtC, I cannot recover them.This is a digital transfer, not a physical product! Again, be certain to send me your Bitcoin wallet address and check it for accuracy!
