I think the only reason it went up so fast was because of MtGox.
Now that it is gone, I highly doubt that we'll even see $400 again.

Merchants can also accept Bitcoin without using PayPal.

Why the hell would someone use PayPal to accept Bitcoin? 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction... To accept Bitcoin... Lol. 
People were excited about Bitcoin because;
- Decentralized
- Almost no fees
People disregard all those benefits/advantages of Bitcoin simply because PayPal decides to accept it?
PayPal accepting Bitcoin defeats the entire purpose of Bitcoin, and it's not even cheap to accept it.
It just doesn't make sense. Yeah, PayPal has a large user base... so what? If Bitcoin needs companies like PayPal to succeed, it has failed.

Fools are being parted with their money.
Crypto has failed. Bitcoin and Litecoin have declined tremendously. There is no way, not in a hundred years, that any of those currencies will rise again.
Consider yourself lucky if Bitcoin hits $400 within 10 years or Litecoin $5 within the same time period. 
Companies investing in bitcoin doesn't mean shit. They have been investing for 2 years, and the price has been going down for what, 18 - 24 months? LOL!
It's better if you sell now. At least you'll still get *something*. In a few weeks time, it will be sub $100.
The only reason bitcoin/litecoin went up so much was because of MtGox + China hype. Both are over/gone, so the currencies are **dying**.

Wow, Bitcoin almost sub $200.
Looks like its slowly dying despite all the attempts by investors... This is the worst time to invest in cryptocurrencies.

Arabs are too busy slaughtering each other. Pretty sure Bitcoin isn't on their mind.
