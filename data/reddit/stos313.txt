Okay. I THOUGHT I remembered it hitting $500, but the coinbase chart show it hitting a peak of $425 on Nov 4th, then $457 on December 19th. 
Do they do an average?  Heh, is it perhaps a bit of a bias toward showing price stability?
@_date: 2016-04-25 18:27:39
Aaaah- you know I think you are right. I seem remember it shoring up very briefly, then shooting down. The chart on coinbase didn't show it going that high, because i think they do a daily average?

Oh I don't doubt that.  I know people here have issues with coinbase....while I am sure that there are good reasons for that, I am not one of them...for how I use it, and for what I do, I find it very helpful and secure.
But I think that doing so is good- as promoting stability is one thing that I believe will give the currency greater value in the future.

The reason for my excitement was I thought that its demand had increased due to some legitimacy.
But according to that chart, it looks like China is gobbling it up.
On that note- are there any English-language reports or news sources on how China uses BC?  I hear conflicting things- and I believe it was reported (not necessarily true mind you), that that last spike was some sort of Chinese pyramid scheme?

Don't fool yourself- they want your Bitcoin, but they want it as cheap as possible.  Take it from us who have been around since before the Mt. Gox hack, been through many iterations of "China bans bitcoin", the bitfinex hack, the poloniex hack, etc. and every time Bitcoin comes back- and comes back stronger.

I don't have all my money in BC, because there is still risk. I'm one of those guys who still treats it more or less like an investment- which I know is problematic. I do spend a bit of coin here and there- but not a lot.

@_date: 2017-12-04 00:04:17
That being said, giving Coinbase ownership of your private keys is no different than giving your money to banks instead of stuffing it under your mattress. 
When people first start out, I always advise them to keep it in Coinbase until they are more comfortable with crypto as a whole. 
When you are more comfortable being more "hands on" in the ownership of your private keys, you might want to look into something like a ledger or tresor, which is an off line "cold" storage device.  While you have more security, you also run the risk of losing your coin if you make a mistake. 
Keep in mind that money stored off line can be harder to move if you are trading, or using BTC to buy things. I tend to think of cold wallets as savings, and wallets like Coinbase as "checking". 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:10:02
They are trading BTC because of market demands. They are not trading BCH because of market demands. 
Im willing to bet they will trade LTC before BCH- and if they do so it will be because of market demands. 
The zealousness of Bcashers is pretty hilarious- as they are now getting to the point of rejecting their once great love of a free market in favor of their passionate ideology of the week- Verism.

So we are talking $1.60 if you are withdrawing $20, $4 fee if you are taking out $50, $8 for 100, etc....
thats pretty nuts.  
Granted it is still cheaper than say a typical commission rate when you exchange foreign currencies (about 10-15%) but I want to say, significantly more than foreign ATM fees (1-2%?)
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:25:54
I think part of what he is trying to say (emphasis on THINK), is that people do not spend their BC, because they (we?  Definitely I) don't want to spend a currency that you think will only appreciate over time.  
If I spend a third of a coin when its worth $300, and i think that BC will be worth- say $1,000 in the next couple of years, then I am losing over $200 by spending $100 worth of coin now.
I don't know that I would call that "greed" necessarily- but more- long term investing.
That being said, that $1,000 spike was one of the worst things to happen to BC, as it made BC users (like myself)  aware of its potential and value, and now don't want to spend my coin.
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:07:10

That's an interesting point- BC did get a lot of attention when it spiked. 
As to your trust point- I agree, however I think high spikes and crashes overall, are bad for earning that trust.  
I wonder how BC would be viewed if it hit 400 through slow, steady increases, an no big blips?

Thinking that it's value will always increase, is how bubbles are created. 
What you have to remember is that the supply of bc is always going up. The only way the value will grow is if the increase of the demand on a regular basis is if the demand goes up HIGHER than the supply. 
That means if demand decreases, stays the same, or doesn't go up as high as the supply, (that last part is important) the value goes down. 
What I would worry about is over long periods of time, when it's usages becomes exhausted and it's demand stagnates, it's value may slowly depreciate unless somehow it's supply stops. 
Of course, some person or entity could but a bunch and take them out of the money supply- but they would be acting like the fed which would cause some of you to get your collective panties in a bunch. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:27:25
Actually, this is very helpful.
If I'm reading this correctly, there are 46.5 million people who at some point have bought, sold, used bit coin in some sort of way- but 45 million of those people have fractions of a coin (essentially the $10 in coin that coin base offers).  
96% of all bit coins are in the hands of .5% of its users.
And it seems that most people are hoarding coins, and looking at them as an investment, rather than a fluid currency.  
Its interesting data...thank you.

Thats great- I'm not doubting that.  My point is, I don't give a fuck who invented my online banking software, I'm saying the premise of this post is fallacious.  
The claim is "bitcoin is better than traditional banks (I'm I'll also assume credit unions) because bank hours suck".  While I don't disagree that banks (and credit unions) have pretty crappy hours generally speaking, I do most- if not ALL of my banking online and at ATMs.  With my credit union, I have the option of doing my banking on line, at an ATM, OR in person.
With my bitcoin account, I can ONLY bank (or hell, even access my currency) online- and oh yeah, some super cool awesome ATM in Singapore or something.
While bitcoin fascinates me, and I think it has a place in our economy (in fact I'm willing to bet that we can't even think to its future applications), some of its supporters can get a bit overzealous about its perceived "superiority" to traditional currency and banks.

@_date: 2014-05-23 17:15:28
Interesting- I didn't know that. 
As for demand, I would assume as more people get connected to the internet (especially in BRIC countries) it will rise- assuming (and this is a big assumption)- that people have confidence in the currency. 
The problem with a currency with a limited supply, and intervals of its growth, is that it is much more sensitive to demand shocks. 
This could be problematic with what I think is one of the best applications of bit coin- a place to keep your money for those who live in a country with high inflation. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:06:40
Good point about processing transactions.  Though honestly, I bank with a credit union, and I feel like most if not all my transactions process immediately. I'll definitely be on the lookout for that now. 
As for people in need of physical banks, I agree, but bitcoin is not a solution for that.

As deceptive as this chart is, one thing investors will see that IS useful, is that BC makes a valuable "beta" investment. 
Capital funds usually comprise of two major components- "alpha" investments, which tend to go up and down with the health of the market; and "beta" investments, which are investments that go up and down independent of the health of the market. 
BTC is looking like a GREAT part of a beta portfolio!

The thing is, for the (for lack of a better term) "crypto movement" to be successful, it needs to be taken seriously.  Bloody skydiving arm might get libertrollians fapping to some Ayn Rand fantasy, but not necessarily more "mainstream" potential users.

I respectfully disagree.  At the moment, it looks like trolling neckbeards are a greater threat to BTC than anything- including regulators.  You can't put the genie back in the bottle, but you can troll into powerlessness.
Morons on the other hand go from one get rich quick scheme to the next whenever they get burned, you know?

My understanding of it is that if you and I conduct say a dozen transactions a day, we create a side chain, and once a month or once a week- whatever increment we may decide- we settle up and record one transaction on the blockchain rather than 84 a week or 360 a month. 
Am I understanding it right?

Bitcoin is awesome.  But its not going to bring down every single central bank on earth.  Its not going to stop every single government on earth from engaging in central banking.  
I DO think central banks will hold BTC in their reserves someday, and with BTC around it will give working people across the country an alternative for when their governments hyperninflate...but we are a very VERY long ways away from Central Banking to be a thing of the past.  
Look at Venezuela- we love to talk about how apprently BTC is booming there and being sold at a premium, but while its its $60 million in trading may sound impressive ( that represents, what, .015% of its $400 billion GDP?

There are a lot more people in r/BTC who unironically do so as well.
@_date: 2019-03-27 14:08:45
There are a lot more than Panama. 
I’m not going to waste my time googling this for you, but for starters there is THE ENTIRE EUROPEAN UNION. Like seriously, did you not watch any global news in last decade?  The economic crises in Greece and like half a dozen other nations had nonstop debate about their lack of an ability to look at monetary policy as a possible solution since they did not have their own central bank. 
Also a lot of former European colonies, despite being sovereign states, do not have their own central bank and rely off of some weird colonial currency. The NAF in the Dutch Caribbean states comes to mind, and I believe some former French colonies in Africa have some sort of “African Franc”. 
There are at least half a dozen countries that use the US dollar as either their official currency, peg their currency to our, or use the dollar as a de facto currency. Though as our empire falls, you will start to see less and less of this. 
I’m sure there are other examples of this too, but I’m not going to google that for you. This was all just on the top of my head. 
Anyways, apologies if you really are in middle school, but seriously, either way, read a book kid.

^ Newbie here.  They have been filtering in since 1k ;)  But you are right, in that the recent spike will get more attention, and I appreciate you mentioning that.
That being said, as a newbie, the thing that drives me nuts- and what I think actually impedes the growth of BC, is BC users.
Its value, for me personally- is its utility, and its transparency.  I don't give a fuck about the fed, I don't care (that much) about central banks, and as soon as someone refers to my US$ as "Fiat currency"- I pretty much fit them for a tin foil hat.
Granted- in an environment like this where most users are far FAR more advanced than I am (I bought most of my coins, and my home mine is an antiquated Antminer S2), I understand that its actually a GOOD thing that much of the conversation is over my head- as that is where innovation and creativity can develop.
If you want the currency to grow- talk about it's benefits, not the pitfalls or the money in my pocket.  When 99.9999% of the world has been raised in socio-economic environment to value the little colored pieces of paper their wallet, they aren't going to suddenly punch a ticket on the crypto currency train because someone told skooled them on reddit.  Be nice to us newbies!  The most of us there are, the more demand we give to your magic internet coins :)

I honestly feel a lot better about it now that the Chinese have cracked down on high volume margin trades.  Just some context- OKCoin went from trading a volume of over $5million BTC (NOT USD or Yuan) at its peak to...to now, what 11k BTC (I just checked).
Also, say what you will about Trump, but a lot of foreign money goes into the market and into our banks to hold our currency because it has traditionally been the most stable.  As foreign investors sense civil instability, plus a leader who can add and take away value at the speed of a tweet, BTC will become a convenient and safe place to store your wealth.

You should invest EXACTLY all $5000, and you will be a millionaire in 9-11 months.
This is a super volatile market with no oversight, no regulations, no "FDIC", no "authorized/licensed trader", that trades globally 24 hours a day.  There is big risk here, so you should not invest more than you can afford to lose- and while I don't think it will ever go down to zero- I remember chasing btc from $1000 USD all the way down to the low 200's.  
If you can't handle volatility- seriously- STAY OUT OF CRYPTOS.  I would also consider a negligible amount per pay check- say anywhere from $5-20.  I did that for years and it was pretty great for me.

I respect where you are coming from- as I share some of your cynicism.  It is your last statement that I am most concerned about- if we do nothing Uncle Sam WILL get his.
Here is the situation as I understand it today...as the law currently stands, if I use say a coinbase wallet to buy my falafel at Amsterdam in AdMo once a week all from a coin I bought when it was worth say $460, then supposedly my I dunno lets say $10 purchase would be subject to a $10 capital gains tax.
The current law hurts the fungiblity of money, which could hurt its price and its ability to grow.  Its only a matter of time before there is a big panic sell because the IRS is auditing the shit out of Coinbase or Bittrex users.  
The message wouldn't be a "negotiation" - as we can't even agree on a protocol let alone a regulatory structure- but just a simple "we are here, we are the future, just get out of the way and let us exist".
And to further your cynicism, I'm talking more about incorporating BTC into campaign financing than anything else.  If members of Congress start fundraising significant amounts of money through BTC they will surely think twice about regulating it.
The point is, Congress is going to act on Bitcoin one way or another- and we can either have a seat at the table or be on the menu.
@_date: 2016-12-21 06:23:02

I like to look at the trading volume on exchanges to make those calls, but I usually just check the okcoin app on my phone.  FWIW on election night, I noticed that Coinbase's volume shot up, while OKCoin CNY and the other chinese exchanges were around normal.

This is HUGE for a number of reasons:
1) BTC is legit in the eyes of the SEC. This might not matter to us, but it brings in more institutional money. It also should help with taxes on gains?  Maybe?
2) could some of our crypto holdings turn to stock?  Could you see securities trading like cryptos?
3) they flat out say ICOs must follow the Howey test in order to be considered a security.  I assume for some utility tokens like ETH and NEO they would fail the test?
The one downside though is this could mean SEC becomes the regulatory agency, not CFTC- which has seemed more open and accepting of the technology of the two agencies. Plus- in the case of (for lack of a better word) "utility tokens" treating some cryptos like a digital commodity makes more sense.

I'm not saying they aren't there- but it defaults to BCH. For users like you or I that's fine - but I can't recommend to folks who are new to the game. It's too easy for them to lose money on.

Just got off the phone with my brother in law about setting up his Bittrex account, heh. 
On top of that I got married last month and my best man beautifully worked in my bitcoin fascination into his toast, to where throughout the reception people were asking me how to buy.

I wouldn't say full fud, but I take everything I read in the other sub with a great deal of skepticism. This one thing though- to a layman such as myself- makes sense on the surface. I just figure there is more to the story than what they are saying and that I can find it here. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:42:18

Upvotes is one thing, compensation is another.  On the BTC forum I'm actually getting BCH "tips".
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:24:30
I got $17 for just typical BCH shilling from a throwaway.  Well...I think it was 7-8 at the time, BCH has since jumped, but still- that's not nothing.  Then I went too far with praise that was obviously fake and got added to a "trollodex" or something?  The BCH stopped thereafter.  The tipping thing is real.
Then there is this:

Woah, looks like he took that website down.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:39:56
I can confirm- I have a few "dummy accounts" where I went on r/BTC's sub, said how I'm a "BCH convert-" low and behold I get all of these "tips". That's how they literally pay people to say good things about BCH and against BTC. 
I WILL say this though- you go too far and say something like "All hail our lord and savior Roger Ver", and they downvote you and kick you off the tip list. They figure you are a troll at that point. 
Don't believe me, try it!  Go on there and talk about how you "saw the light" of the "one true Bitcoin".

In theory go up. The rate at which new bitcoin will enter the market will decrease by 50%. The money supply is still increasing as it always does, but at a slower rate. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:00:36
Ummmm doubtful.  
First of all it's in English, and while I'm sure there are plenty of non English speakers on here, I'm willing to bet your typical Chinese/Korean/Russian/Cypriot/Latvian trader probably isn't checking in on here often. 
Of those native English speakers, how many BTCers have Reddit accounts?  
Coinbase alone had 11.7 million users in October, there are probably at least 12 mm now, and in the English speaking world what- maybe 2/3 of BTC users have some sort account? 3/4?  So let's say there are 3-4 million other "English reliant Bitcoin users" for a total of maybe 15-16 mm. 
There are half a million subscribers here, and even being very generous, with maybe another half mil checking casually but not subscribing (if that's even a thing)- we would account for less than 10% of users JUST in the English speaking world. 
Granted- I'm willing to bet the typical Reddit Bitcoin subscriber hold significantly more than the non subber- so maybe if everyone at the same time made dramatic moves, it could shock and exchange- but not make any permanent effects. 
@_date: 2019-12-29 13:22:43
Pretty sure none of those industries ever said those things.  Post Office is waaaay more busy now thanks to shipping packages- that’s way more profitable than personal correspondence (which declined significantly with the telephone). 
Blockbuster had the opportunity to buy Netflix for pennies, but just didn’t think that it would take off. I’m sure they would have loved to maintain sales without as many brick and mortar stores, they just didn’t read the market right. 
Radio wasn’t scared of tv- radio stations got the first tv licenses. 
And newspapers LOVED the internet at first- it was a lot of hype that sold a lot of paper. Most major papers have transitioned well into the net and don’t mind one bit that they do not need as many humans and facilities to put out paper editions. I think social media fucked with their model more but most papers are pivoting well. 
If you need  bismo babble to psych yourself up into thinking you are some “cyberpunk” fine I guess...but I dunno. Seems kind of silly to me.

According to CMC, Tether's ratio of volume is significant- but pretty small. And tbh- I think BCC has a higher ratio of its trade volume tied to tether than than BTC, but I'm basing that off of a very casual glance on cmc. 
That being said- lack of transparency and trust in tether, and the possibility of a "run" on the currency seems valid imho, anc I definitely do not want to be caught holding a bag of tether.

I had a hard time reading this, as it used a LOT of "paranoia jargon".
Will this new law regulate bitcoin exchanges, or any individual who uses bitcoin?  I think an interesting unintended consequence will be that you may have a regulated exchange that may prove to be a "safer" place to store your money. 
It would suck if this applied to businesses that wanted to take bitcoin though.

I'm wondering what would happen if we looked at btc tx's and their wallet addresses- if we would find the same thing.  
Honestly- I'm not complaining TOO much- because a vulnerability is a vulnerability, and all it did was help us get more resistant quicker.  Since they don't believe in side chains- would that make bcash MORE vulnerable to these types of attacks?

Thank you everyone!  You gave some great insights.
I get that its not a blockchain, and aside from having a crypto currency element, is not really anything like bc.
I'm fascinated with it, because I feel like one of the more practical uses of BC is for remittance- and ripple seems to be created specifically for that purpose.  Its more of a financial instrument, than a true currency.  
And while I get that it is premined, I just don't really understand how the currency appreciates and depreciates.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:42:46

@_date: 2016-09-06 01:07:08
You are on to something....
Poor people tend to have less access to traditional banking, AND more access to cell phones and even smart phones. 
A decent, free, and easy to use app could definitely lead to more demand for the currency- assuming they had places they could spend it. 
Hell, you look outside the US in nations with high inflation, you might be on to something. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:17:29

I'll post the minute mark later when I have some time (if no one beats me to it), but it was great sitting through a hearing where good things were being said about Bitcoin and crypto.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:28:47
Most definitely NOT brilliant.
@_date: 2016-09-04 21:06:34
Honestly, as an investment. I threw like $100 in it for s and g's and that's probably all I'll do. I would consider real money if I learn more about it and like what I hear. 
If it climbs to a buck or two- hey free money!  If not, eh. 
I do hate that it's a banking application and hate banks, but I really do think the near future utility of crypto is this function of making remittances easier. 
As for BC, I love its principles, and I love how potentially democratic it is...but after trying to really go out of my way to use it in my everyday life more, I find it currently less useful than USD in my credit union, aside from the occasional on line transaction.  Like almost all Americans, I don't hate the fed to the point where I would inconvenience myself very much. 
And as for the democracy of BC, we seem to have traded the federal reserve bank process from a bunch of people in China running massive server farms. So, I dunno- potato potato?
That being said (sorry, apparently I had to get that all off my chest, lol)- I think there will be plenty of really interesting applications for BC going forward- applications that I can't even possibly conceive of right now, which is why I stick around this crazy verse of magic internet coins, lol. 
And as for ripple, I just see it as something to complement BC but for a ton of reasons will never compete with it.

What is "throne sniffing?"
It cracks me up that libertarians who love bitcoin get mad at those "who are only in it for the money".  I guess the virtue of selfishness is only truly virtuous when it comes with all the other libertarian baggage too?  Seriously whats up with that?
That being said- I really do "believe" in bitcoin fwiw.  I don't HATE the fed (don't really love it either), I believe in federalism and Keynesian economics- but I really do see a big value for bitcoin to help the unbanked- more in the developing world than in the US.  When I have the option to pay with bitcoin, I do, and I see it playing an important role in the future of work.  Hell- I'm even totally okay with the benefits of uncensorable money and think they outweigh the drawbacks.
I think its great that we are developing a tool that protect everyone in the world from unfair capital controls and hyperinflation.  I also think its great that I (and many, many other people) can make some money in the process.

I think this is a better way of thinking about its applications.  Bitcoin's value is not going to increase due to libertrollian neckbeards using it to pay for Rush tickets, Rand Paul contributions, etc....its going to be an alternative for corporations, and very rich people, to move their money across the world easily and safely. 
The trick is, convincing these institutions and people that doing this can be as safe and secure as a brick and mortar bank.  I think bc can be the new "Swiss/Cayman/whatever" banking system.

Lets help him out.  Here is what Alexander the Great had to say about foreigners:
“Now that the wars are coming to an end, I wish you all to prosper in peace.
From now on, may all mortals live as one people, in fellowship, for the good of all.
See the whole world as your homeland, with laws common to all, where the best will govern regardless of their race.
Unlike the narrow-minded, I make no distinction between Greeks and Barbarians.
I am not interested in the origin of the citizens, or the race into which they were born.
I have only one criterion by which to distinguish them: their virtue.
For me, any good foreigner is a Greek and any bad Greek is worse than a Barbarian.
If disputes ever arise among you, do not resort to weapons, but solve them peacefully.
If needed, I will arbitrate between you.
See God, not as an autocratic despot, but as the common father of all so that your conduct will be like the life of siblings of the same family.
I, on my part, see you all as equal, whether you are white or dark-skinned.
And I wish you all to be not only subjects of the Commonwealth, but members of it, partners of it.
To the best of my ability, I will strive to do what I have promised.
Let us hold onto the oath we have taken tonight with our libations as a Contract of Love”.

No dumb ass, I trade crypto currency. Or at least I did until the tax bill went into effect making all crypto to crypto trades taxable events.

FWIW, AEK FC- a team that was literally founded by refugees (and hence, has a soft spot for them), is about to with the Championship of the Greek Super League....I wonder if their supporter group, "Original 21" would be interested in having some Greek refugee gear.

Viva Le France!
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:26:43
Here is how I look at it.  People are quick to throw the word "lambo" around but shit man...between the cost and the maintainence, even if you are worth a few mil, those cars are not really made to be driven every day.  
The thing to remember is that the money you are getting off of BTC is ONLY its appreciation- so the BTC you currently HODL may continue to be worth more, but you are not necessarily making more BTC (assuming you are considering quitting your job, or not continuing to do what it is you did to earn BTC).  
While it is safe to say that BTC will continue to appreciate in the long term, it may be subject to short term dips.  You do not want to be in a situation where you have to wait for a market correction or appreciation before you feel comfortable making a big purchase.
So what I would do in your position is pay off your debts- where the interest is greater than your expected appreciation (case in point, I recently sold some crypto to pay off my credit card), and maybe pay off/buy your/a house.  
Things like cars are about vanity and utility- if your fiat is paid off and is in good shape, then I wouldn't consider getting a new car until it starts getting old and breaking down, and the cost to maintain it exceeds the expected appreciation of the BTC you would spend on a car. 
As for what you should expect for its appreciation, I mean the currency went from sub penny over 2k in what- 8 years?  Don't expect that.  I would expect the time it will take for its price to double to decrease- as I am sure there is a pattern starting to form.  
(In fact- is there a graphic out there anywhere of the amount of time it took for BTC to double in value?)
Anyways, good on you- for both doing well with your BTC strategy, and for staying grounded in your success!

I know there are a lot of discussions on here about those things already, so I should just continue to read up on that, but I'm more concerned that we get A reasonable solution rather than exactly "what I want".

@_date: 2015-11-04 15:05:41
My thoughts on BC's rise.
I think there are three big factors...first was the ruling in the EU that essentially legitimized the currency, which I'm sure had a lot to do with Chinese trading, which caused it to rise back to $300, where I assume traditional banks- who have been watching it since it rose and fell from the hundreds to a thousand to 200 again started buying up coins.
I assume that when it hits big milestones, you will see spikes and dips as "early adopters" cash in (as I would if I were in their position).  It will be interesting to see how much of an effect this will have.
Also, does anyone know how or why China keeps effecting the price?  
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:08:08
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:10:04
Anyone know why the price spiked a bit ago to 300, then dropped back down to the low 200s?
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:22:33
You are correct, and I probably wasn't clear.  See my edit above ;)
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:27:30
Ah- not sure how throne sniffing applied to me, but whatever. 
I agree that I would rather pay taxes than be jailed, I just saw the way they taxed us as being a cost of passing that tax bill. I think- fwiw- the taxable action should only occur when we cash out. 
Right hodlers just need to be honest with themselves that this tax bill screwed them, just like left hodlers (myself included), need to honest with themselves that the validity we now have- hell this whole crazy fun ride we have been on- started and persevered because of people whose politics we don't like. 
Out of a distrust of the Fed that I occasionally agree with but do t quite understand, came something great that I believe will make the world a better place.

Yeah AEK stands for "Athletiki Enosi Konstantiopoli" or "Athletic Union of Constantinople". It was formed from refugees who were kicked out of Constantinople during the "exchange of the minorities".

This is awesome- thank you!

Agreed!  Sometimes I think it MAY be reflective of the community!

No. No he is not smarter than us. Accumulating wealth is neither an indicator of intelligence nor character. 
He was in the right place at the right time and made some money. Just like many Bitcoiners (myself included). Now he is evading extradition to Belize for a murder he committed while hiring prostitutes to shit on his face. His life must be pretty empty and unfulfilling to resort to playing commando in your “jungle compound” fitted with the latest in poop hammock offerings.

Fuck....does this mean that we now know the "ultimate question?!"
No one utter it, lest we want all of creation to end and come back as something even more bizarre and in explicable...again.

is more curated and moderated, to the point where "big block enthusiasts" feel that they are censored.
is less curated and moderated, thus 10% of the posts are complaining about the other sub, and why their sub is better.  Then when you post things big blockers don't like, you get "censored" through down votes.

I thought Antpool was signaling for segwit now.  Is there a place I can check?
edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:11:29
That’s bullshit. Most rich people are so because they crawled down the right uterus. Meritocracy is a myth.

I forget how many Elon bootlickers this sub has too. I usually associate hero worship of a spy jackasses who fell into money with r/BTC but I guess we got our share too.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:53:45
much appreciated!

But...he wasn't.  There were literally dozens of automakers competing with him.

I seriously hope this was a sarcastic comment- but in case it’s not....the same way they currently use their cellphone. 
You know that Kenya is like literally THE prime example of people using electronic currency over fiat, right?  
Like despite Elon’s family’s best efforts, sub Sahara Africa is NOT just some massive tribal grassland free from any technology whatsoever.

What about the rest of The Pentavirate: the Queen of England, the Pope, the Gettys, and Col. Sanders!?  Looks like they recently had one of their meetings at the Meadows in Colorado. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:42:58
Nah, it’s not the first time- but just watch the growing number of down votes I get for saying so.
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:06:02
No, no kids.  Wow, something to look forward to :)
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:43:02
I see.  This is helpful, thank you.  Do we know which pools have already flipped?  (It this is a "LMGTFY" question, feel free to say so hahaha).
It looks like I need to mine with another pool for the time being.

I blame the neckbeards

No it wont

What regulations?
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:29:12
OMG it’s all I can think about!!!  /s
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:18:07
Dude, seriously, have you even heard of M-Pesa?  Believe it or not, Africa is ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to digital cash transactions.  
Also, rural Russia and US are hardly shining examples of outposts of civilization.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:37:07
Oh- and OP- I posted the same response to your question in both subs...take a look at the responses (or lack thereof in this case of this sub) and that should give you some context.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:32:26
Yeah, I agree. It's a supermarket industry site, so the details may not matter to the readers. 
But I wonder if it is an application of ETH??
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:03:58
No- but I also haven’t killed anyone, nor move to the jungle to play “libertarian commando cosplay,” nor has anyone EVER shat on me. 
So - I’d say Stos313- 1 McAfee- 0.

I don't shop at Walmart, in fact I HATE Walmart- but this is a great example of applications of blockchain tech.  I wonder what service they used.
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:02:55
Gah.  I'm in until (if?) it hits 100k.  2k down, 98 to go!
Depending on how this scaling issue resolves itself, I will probably see it before I die, but would LOVE to see 100k in lol, a decade??

Just because BTC isn't doing what you want it to do, doesn't mean it's failing. 
It may just become the "reserve currency of the internet" because for 99% of the world, their local fiat is just fine.  That's not a bad thing- nor a good thing, it's just where it is given the limitations of the tech and it's users. 
Remember- most people generally probably don't share the typical bitcoiner's view on the fed, de/centralization, etc. All most people want from their money is for it to spend.

Good stuff- thank you!
