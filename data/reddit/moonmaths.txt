What tastes better to you?  
For the curious, I think I've found their recipes.  
[Joylent]( vs. [Queal](  
Basically 
Whey protein (exactly 72 g each)  
Maltodextrin (exactly 125 g each)  
Soy Meal (~120 g)  
Oat Meal (~ 200g)  
Vitamins (inc omega 3)  
They both look all right, but I'm not sure why there's so much maltodextrin.  And so much protein.  129g per diem sounds like a lot of protein for normal people. Hmm.  Tempting.  
Answer my question if any of you have got time please.. [Why use maltodextrin at all](

piping up.  
Good question.  Ignore the hate.

**Pro**:   
-you get to ask Andreas questions and he generally has well-thought out answers  
-first class is really easy, 1 hour a week tops plus you have andreas or someone else's ear for another hour/wk  
**Con**:  
-only the first class is free (the rest are exorbitant)  
-the first class is really simple and is more business/conceptual (what is a unit of account?) than technical/techy (¬Lets do multisig with bitcoind).    
Took it last winter.  They do it all the time.

Gavin wants to increase max block size limit, because:
**Like I'm Five:**
Everyone will be shouting "issue my transaction, issue my transaction!" whilst the network gets more and more congested.  If you can't spend your money without shouting a lot and waiting a lot, why not spend it somewhere else where you don't have to get so tired shouting?
**Like I'm a little older:**
Block time variance is an issue as we approach the maximum block size.  (A block occurs every ten minutes on average, but sometimes takes an hour to be found).  
If we're close to the block size limit and it takes an hour or more to find the next few blocks, full nodes will be inundated with requests for transactions, and will drop them when they have too many requests (over 1MB).  Wallets will then have to re-transmit their transactions, and this could create tons of traffic on the network, not necessarily slowing things down, but creating a hassle for everyone.  End game: If you have to re-transmit your transaction multiple times to get it onto the network, it becomes a hassle and bitcoin won't take off.  
For example.  
Gavin is saying that if you want to buy, say, a video game online, and are stuck in this scenario.. Not only will you have to wait a few hours for your transaction to go through, but you will have to make sure that your computer is connected to the network (computer open, not asleep) for the transaction to go through.  Just another hoop to hop through.  
If I'm wrong, correct me.

Interesting. I remember trying piiko when it just came out. The pricing wasn't amazing but it's a great concept. I'm keeping my ears to the ground.

They don't, but a good addition to the list.  
It's probably got to do more with Germany than with the companies themselves.

Note: 
[BitRefll]( and [Piiko]( allow this too.  
If anyone knows of a site that lets you top up in Germany though, please tell me about it.  I've been waiting for it.

Is that the cumulative graph or monthly graph?

As a miner is calculating the POW, does it add incoming tx to the POW after every failed attempt and what kind of resources does that require for the computer?  
Similarly, how does this work when mining with a pool?  
Seems to me like it'd be easier just to mine empty blocks or ones with fewer tx so you could pump out a winning block faster, but would love have a little more detail.
