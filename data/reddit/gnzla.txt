I've never thought of it that way before. You definitely have a good point!

I'm not sure we can get our hands on any howitzers, but I'm sure we can find you something you'd like :) 
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:32:56
Awesome! We're a distributor for Benelli, stock the kel-tec KSG, and can get a hold of nearly anything else. Except mossbergs. My boss refuses to sell mossbergs for some reason. 
Anyway, I hope we're able to accept your business :)

Interesting... I haven't done any research into accepting litecoin on our site, but I don't see why I couldn't implement it if we decide to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:28:19
I sent them an email, thanks for the connection!

We're based in Illinois, and ship nationwide. You can receive a firearm from us as long as you have a FFL dealer near you that accepts transfers.

While I can't promise anything, as it doesn't fit our current model, I know I could set it up if there was enough interest in the idea. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:09:51
Good question. I'll contact them to find out later today. 
We have a different model though, as we're already a major distributor for Colt, IWI, and others and we have stock on hand :)

Hmm... The only problem I see is that the recoil might LITERALLY rip your arms off. 
I can sell them to you, but I assume no liability for your use of them ;) 
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:33:28
Hopefully! I've been hoping to do this for months, and finally had a chance to bring it up. I'll definitely keep everyone updated on his decision :)

As a bitcoiner myself, I've always found it encouraging if an merchant accepts any sort of cryptocurrency. I don't see why it's an issue if an establishment accepts multiple forms of payment, especially if bitcoin is included amongst them. 
Though you are right about the free part. That's a nice perk. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:04:46
Hey, awesome! Thanks for the heads up. They're now number one on my list of merchant services to use if this works out. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:27:29
Just xposted, thanks! Also, ammo would be sold as well. We just don't like to stock a whole lot of it, because the margins are slim and shipping is a bitch. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:00:50
Nope :) I like to keep work details off of my personal accounts for security's sake, but you'll see a post from me with all the details on my work account if he decides to accept bitcoin.

Bitpay is who I was considering using at first. Is there any particular reason I should use bitpay over gocoin? 
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:32:46
I hear it's a mess out there. Good luck, and stay safe! 
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:33:32
You'll need a destructive devices license for the 40 watt. I'll see about getting you a 20 watt model though ;)

Gold is super valuable for industrial and technological uses. It's a great conductor, resists corrosion, and has some thermoelectric properties. 
Even if it wasn't pretty, it would still have value.

Copper was a currency for a time. Not so much anymore, but it still has value. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:21:07
That, and, it sure is pretty. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:20:45
I definitely agree. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:16:22
That just seems really inconvenient to carry around. I can definitely understand why we made the switch to small shiny rocks. 
EDIT: Rai stones, TIL. Thanks for the information! That was a really interesting read. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 02:45:28
Neat, thanks for the link! 
@_date: 2015-11-21 21:32:43
This guy gets it.
