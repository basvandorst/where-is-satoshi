It does? The ATMs I use are for deposit and withdrawl.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:03:11
Forgive me, but a machine that only lets you buy bitcoin is only half an ATM. And not even the good half of an atm.
I never deposit money into an ATM. My paychecks are direct deposited to my bank account, so my only use for an atm is to get cash out.

I for one care more about search results than privacy.  I don't care who sees my searches.  In fact let me pull up some recent ones:
* How to find google search history
* iPhone 6 macromors
* fallout new vegas repair skill
* creative HN-900
* netherlands vs argentina

I'd like to reiterate what I said before, I don't care who sees my searches.  The NSA can have at it.  I'm a normal person with no connections to terrorist groups or tendencies towards anarchy.  There will not come a point when my past searches would be a detriment to any aspect of my life, regardless of who had access.

Almost Human didn't have hints.  It was a major accepted currency, and was discussed multiple times on the show.

Honestly at this point I'd prefer stability over this volatility.  Increase is all fine and dandy but it keeps crashing which is the problem.

I've had a good experience with coinbase.  Bought at $133, recieved a few days later.  Unfortunately their value has dropped considerably since, but I've made up for some of it by day trading on gox.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:27:57
Yeah, I'm noticing that people realllllllly stick to their guns, even with proof that they're wrong...

I have these awesome work shoes that I bought last year at Payless that I've since worn out and they've stopped selling.  I'd give someone the equivalent of $1 USD in bitcoin if they could do some google-fu and find them or something similar for me.  
if anyone's interested in making a quick buck lemme know.

But the real question is, would he do it for a Klondike bar?
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:36:55
Mt Gox is still the largest by far, and typically has the highest price.  That said, getting money in is a bit of a challenge.  You can do a bank wire transfer or use a 3rd party like Dwolla, but that's a hassle.  If you do choose to use Mt Gox, you can withdraw your Bitcoin once you purchase by just entering your bitcoin wallet's address.
And this is not the best place to use terms like "Bubble" or "Good investment".  This is a *VERY* pro-bitcoin community, so naturally everyone will tell you it is a good investment, and it's blasphemy to call it a bubble here, so you'll have to go with your own judgement on that.  
Best of luck!
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:19:50
I'd be interested in seeing some charts that show a relatively consistent "weekend dip".
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:41:07
I see what you're getting at here, and the answer is that it's not typically profitable to buy on one exchange, transfer to another, and then sell.  This is usually because Mt. Gox has the higher price, and withdrawing Fiat currency from Gox is next to impossible.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:08:13
Nope. I tried this a few days ago. No confirmations after three days, with an estimated time stuck at 14 hours. Then this morning I got a message saying the transaction had failed and the btc was back in my wallet. They won't hold your money longer than a few days I guess.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:24:05
Basically, yes.  IF bitcoin does become *the* standard global currency, then the "bitcoin" as we know it today would be worth an insane amount.  If this does happen, we would most likely adopt a smaller unit for pricing everyday transactions, such as the mBTC (or perhaps smaller... like nanoBitcoin).

Please, nobody *EVER* put all your chips in.  That's how people lose everything...
This is a high risk/high reward situation.  Sure you could strike it rich, and people have.  But you could also lose everything.  And people have.  I've seen stories on here about a kid who put his whole college savings into bitcoin before it underwent a major decline.  He unfortunately had to cash out before it went back up, and took a major loss.
Only put in what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:03:39
There's a significant wall at $510.  $1.37 million USD more needs to be sold to pass that.    Here's to hoping...

Say you're in college and you sell your friend a textbook for 45 bucks, buy one from him for 50, he buys one for 43, you buy another for 48.  Do you report that to to the IRS?  I highly doubt they care.  Bitcoin can be considered a commodity as much as it can be considered a currency or investment.
Besides, you mentioned you wound up slightly down.  IRS is concerned with income tax, and you didn't have any income.
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:38:42
It's annoying now, I'll agree with you, while the charts push higher and higher than they've ever been before, edging towards 500 bucks....
It's all fun and games until someone loses everything.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:59:57
looks like panic selling is catching on... 550 lasted a couple minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:45:51
The main problem is getting fiat currency out of Mt Gox is extremely difficult.  So yes, you could buy on bitstamp, transfer to Gox, and sell.  But then you can't repeat the process because it's tough to move money out of Gox.  Plus each time you move bitcoins and money there are fees, so there has to be enough of a difference in the price between the two that the fees don't eat away at your potential profit.  Then you have to consider the time you put in, and what you value that at.  After all that, you may just be better off flipping burgers for a few hours.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:42:47
Yes, and I will when I get home tonight.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:42:19
yeah, that's what I said when it passed $400.  Hindsight tells me I should have bought in then.
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:06:31
They only fail if you don't include the recommended fee. I only didn't include it because I wanted to see what would happen. However, I believe that now since the exchange rate is so high that the recommended fees need to be lowered. Right now micro transactions aren't really feasible.
@_date: 2013-05-20 01:14:29
True... Though not a problem for me. Sadface. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:50:59
Problem with this though, bitcoin is inherently *not* user friendly. The learning curve for me was a good hour or two, and I consider myself decently tech-savvy. How am I going to explain it and encourage the Home Depot guys to use it in an effective way?
What's the easiest way for them to take, say, $300 and convert it to and from bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:12:42
That's because you're looking at a logarithmic chart.  Anything volatile like Bitcoin looks nice and stable when you look at a logarithmic chart.
See April 2013, what looks like a minor bump there?  That was actually a *[significant crash]( from $260 down to $80 over 2 days.  Bitcoin went down in value by 70%, and yet it barely registers on your logarithmic chart.
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:51:01
I was curious about the weekend's effect on Bitcoin, so I looked back over the last 10 weeks.  What I discovered...
* Significant growth: 5
* Minimal change: 2
* Slight "dip": 2
* Significant "dip": 1
So I think we can dispel any theories about a "Weekend Dip" occurring on anything close to a regular basis.

No reputable institution is going to grant you a loan if you have no constant stream of income (i.e. a *real* job).  
That said, you said you're a college student?  Look into getting a student credit card from the bank you do your banking with.  It's good to get one as early as possible just to build credit, as long as you use it responsibly.  Student credit accounts are typically good for a few hundred bucks of credit with no annual fees.  My first credit card was one of these from my bank, they gave me a $800 limit.
But please don't buy bitcoins on credit.  You should only ever put in what you can afford to lose.  And if you're putting in money that technically isn't yours... well what if things go south.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:02:32
Confirmed.  It may just be time to freak out.
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:32:04
Um, see [here](  I went ahead and made the charts myself.  Only 3/10 had a dip.  And only 1/10 had a significant dip.

Newbie question: since BitStamp is typically a lower price than Gox, is it possible to buy bitcoins on BitStamp (say for $280) then sell them on Mt.Gox (for $290) and make a $10 profit?

Because people *like* cash.  They spend more money when they can physically touch their money, and are more willing to exchange it for goods and services.  Well guess what, these goods and services are nearly all taxed, so *kaching* for the government.  And they like their *kaching*.

Every American knows what an American Dollar is, how to earn one, and how to spend one.  As for bitcoin... I'm somewhat of an enthusiast, and yet I don't know how I can earn a bitcoin (other than exchanging some of my USD).  I also can't go buy a bag of chips with bitcoin (yet, here's hoping).


Orly? This afternoon I bought a sandwich, using cash.  The price was listed at $3.  Did I pay $3?  Hell no, they charged me $3.27.  A whopping 27 cents went into the pockets of my government, which contributed to the economy.  Hopefully they'll use it to help fix that pothole on Main St.
@_date: 2013-07-06 20:08:26
It is possible. Your coin base wallet has a bitcoin address just like any other bitcoin wallet does.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:35:11
So the transaction was set up to go from my wallet's address to my Mt. Gox account.  Mt. Gox generated temporary addresses for deposits.  So I assume that their temporary address isn't valid anymore?  
Does that mean that in the event that a miner DID mine my transaction, that it would just fail anyway, or do I have to constantly live in fear now that at any moment a certain amount of BTC will just transfer itself to Mt. Gox without me telling it to?
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:44:44
And I am just giving the people a friendly reminder.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:57:00

I bought my BTC on Coinbase, then transferred to Gox for day trading.  Can I just transfer the BTC back to coinbase to get it back to my bank account?
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:50:58
I'm by no means an expert myself.  But a wallet is basically where you hold your bitcoins.  You can download software that you can use to keep them on your computer (whether it be on your PC or some external hard drive for added security).  There are also websites like blockchain that can host a wallet online for you. 
Every wallet has a bitcoin address.  That's a huge long code of letters and numbers that you give to someone when you buy bitcoin from them.  When you give them cash, they send virtual bitcoin to your wallet's address, and that coin is then yours.
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:35:55
And I was right.
@_date: 2013-05-09 09:53:12


So draw all you want, as long as you don't *intend* to make it unfit for reissue.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:13:16
I am assuming though that if a miner did have my transaction in a block to be mined, it would have already been mined.  Besides, I was never high enough in the queue to even be noticed, I was always above 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:43:16
Well I don't believe it.  The transaction just went through this morning, you were right.  If you hadn't warned me, I'd probably be freaking out right now, but as soon as I saw my wallet's balance had dropped, I went straight to Mt. Gox to check, and there it was.
So thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-17 09:36:31
