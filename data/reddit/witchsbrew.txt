It's not about dividends. It's about comparing the S&amp;P, an index of income producing assets, to Bitcoin, a speculative non-income producing asset dependent on what others value it. Any asset that is non-income producing is going to be a worse 'investment' than an income producing asset.

Totally agreed, I just didn't want to conflate fractional reserve and Ponzi schemes as the same thing. I think it will come down to whether MtGox was intentionally delaying withdrawals and whether or not the Gox coins were backed up by BTC or not, and what their intent and goal was.

Why are you so sure of this? Beause you read some other uninformed user make this comment?


Experts involved are saying MtGox only lost 386 coins through transaction malleability:  
The rest were stolen by MK or thrown down a rathole he can recover them from later.
Why was MK/MtGox selling Goxcoins that weren't backed by BTC? That is clearly fraud, and they were doing so AFTER the BTC was supposedly 'stolen'. So somehow you and MK expect us to believe they lost hundreds of millions worth in BTC and then didn't notice it? BULLSHIT

Because Ulbricht agreed to it. Imagine if the price tanks and he wins his case. Then he'd have lost a bunch of money from the coins being in escrow. This way is less risky for both parties basically so they agreed to it.

Yeah he's following the advice any lawyer would give to someone about to face criminal charges, he's not going to give up more evidence or statements people can use against him court.


Of course it's a theft, it's the long-con. He steals most then returns what is left and people are happy (like you). Villain to hero and he keeps the stolen coin.
Not only that why was MtGox selling Gox coins that weren't backed up by BTC? There's other evidence to show MtGox and MK were committing fraud or theft.

In layman's terms-- fractional reserve is when someone deposits $1000 and the bank loans out $900 of it. It works so long as everyone doesn't withdraw their money at once. A Ponzi scheme is when early adopters are paid with the money of later adopters. Fraud is selling something you don't have. The MtGox situation is much closer to fraud or a Ponzi scheme.
Edit; remember a few weeks before MtGox blew up, there were all the people talking about how MtGox was delaying withdrawls? That's a tell-tale sign of a Ponzi scheme. BUT if all MtGox was selling were Goxcoins that they knew were not backed by BTC, it is a case of fraud.
