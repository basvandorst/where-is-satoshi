your teacher's economics background clearly doesn't come into play here as he is very ignorant to what bitcoin is.  But your post is very insightful to the public's perception of BTC.  A lot of redditors don't really have a grasp on just how bad the public's opinion is.  I've seen people tweets that suggested they think its literally a "game nerds play"

how is the DDoS a conspiracy?  I thought that was pretty much confirmed
edit:  nvm I see you said "secret coordinated"

he bought in at 25 dollars and is still way, way ahead?

Dunno what that is, feel free to enlighten.  This is just what I did last week to get a feel and thought it might help some folks

Yeah, I'm just saying one reason that people might reasonably correlate drastically dropping price with failure is because there are now eyeballs on Bitcoin and the volatility and or huge crash could cripple its credibility, creating at least a long term set back.  Basically just playing devil's advocate. The obvious answer to your thread title would be: there is a slew of people strictly in it to make money.  Whether they are new or an early buyer fully bought into the greater good global impact big picture, getting used to staring at a ticker and watching your fortune increase 10% a day is a powerfully addicting thing.  So people react accordingly

I'm in the same boat, free time heavily dedicated to reading up on BTC.  Definitely fascinating.  noticed you said you were a competitive sports bettor, have you checked out any of the BTC sportsbooks?  What's the story with them are they reputable?  I was thinking about posting up at one and doing all my betting through it and have that basically be my "investment" in bitcoin going forward.

Thanks, this makes so much sense.  They are going to need to be constantly getting better and that takes immediate cash flow.

I agree that its potentially world changing technology, but if Bitcoin totally crashes in grandiose fashion with this many people watching won't it really damage its credibility and thus hinder future prospects + mass adoption?  Basically making it either a punchline or a cautionary tale

if you think that's bad, check out the comments on this Winklevoss article.  Yahoo = true gen pop

can someone explain to me why these companies would sell these things versus just using them?

Money solves a great deal of problems.  Being wealthy gives you personal freedom to go wherever you wish to go and pursue whatever you wish to pursue.  The "other side of the fence" has this luxury.

Yeah, I dont get it either.  I was under the impression most people assumed this kind of mass surveillance was going down.

was the 'employee' he solicited the fed to kill actually a witness (was cooperating with LE already)?  Or just a witness in the sense that the dude knew incriminating shit?

I was surprised there wasn't already one of these set up.  How exactly would the escrow work?
