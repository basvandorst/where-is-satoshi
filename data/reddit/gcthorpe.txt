Do you have any links to this data? Neat project.

I think we’re going to continue bleeding until some kind of news or event occurs that causes people to buy. Right now the volume and order book are looking pretty low. This might be a temporary pump. I hope I’m wrong.

So you’re telling me that Bitcoin is going to be 300k and time travel will have been invented.

Noticed those fucking bastards at Bittrex randomly overlooked my Enhanced Verification today. Apparently my photo identification has been used by another account, which makes no sense at all. So, I'm furious as shit. Bittrex is the main exchange I use, all of my Bitcoins are stuck... I enhanced my account in like June, this makes no sense at all.

Looks like we’re in an ascending triangle on the 1 day chart, GDAX. This is a bullish pattern, for those who aren’t aware.

I’ve also been told that no bank in it’s right mind will even touch, let alone associate, with Venezuelan currency.
@_date: 2019-03-14 02:40:59
It has proven very difficult to export Venezuelan cash as the government frowns upon it and has heavy penalizations in place for doing so, or so I’m told.

I’ve heard both Sunday (today) and Monday, not sure though.

Don't know about this. I'm a millennial and I still have trust in current financial institutions. It's rather related to the fact that I can simply make more by investing my money into Bitcoin rather than putting it into a traditional savings account. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:18:46
She'll make it. Have faith.

Shame, maybe try taking on other jobs in the mean time so you can keep adding to your portfolio? Doesn't have to be full time, find something part time. Just a suggestion. Hate to see you miss out on some nice gains.

Oh yes, lods of emone

Keep your eyes on the charts, we may see a correction as we near or hit the 10,000 USD threshold. It's a very large psychological mark. If this is the case, your next opportunity to buy in would be during that dip.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:29:04
No, Bitcoin is becoming the new store of value. It won't replace fiat currency, that's simply not true at this time. Yes, sometime in the future we may see blockchain technology overtake and dominate fiat currencies, but this is still decades away. I'm doubtful that Bitcoin itself will dominate fiat currency. Rather, it would be something better suited to the task.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:10:11
I agree with this, until your playmate makes the correlation that this 24-word recovery phrase on your ass is actually a 24-word recovery phrase used to recover a Bitcoin wallet.

Where the hell did you hear this? I've been around for just over a year and this is the first time I've heard something this far-fetched. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:00:09
Not so much. More or less worried that I don't have anymore fiat to put into Bitcoin. Going to try and sell at the top if I see the opportunity. If not I'll simply HODL knowing that Bitcoin will retrace back to 10k and beyond.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:31:11
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:36:24
I highly doubt we'll see a loss of 80%, I think it's doubtful we'll even see a loss of 50%. I believe a 20-30% correction may occur. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:31:14

Cool story bro.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:02:36
Its truly speculative mate. Don't rely on the opinions of others for such investment purposes. There's a lot of speculation going around that we may correct some after this exponential run-up to the 10k threshold. I don't doubt the idea of this and find it valid. Regardless as to if we correct or not, I personally think we'll continue to rise thereafter. 
People are giving you materials to read so you're able to gain an understanding of the technology yourself and make a better based opinion from there.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:29:10
So, do you think that Bitcoin's price will be suppressed by the futures market?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:31:14
Anything is possible. We've seen 100 billion enter the market this past month alone, giving us a total overall market of 300 billion. Needless to say, this applies the the entire crypto-market in whole, not only Bitcoin, but it's still very impressive. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:28:00
I've only been around for about 10 months, but in all honestly I'm also growing a bit weary. With all the controversy surrounding tether I'm a bit worried about Bitcoins growth and can see a possible correction coming in the near future. I haven't found much analytical research on Bitcoin's growth but I have heard a lot of speculation with its regard in correlation to tether. I will most likely hold as I plan an 'escape route' in the case of a correction, but will also invest once the correction has occurred. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:48:16
Plot twist, what if the reason you are seeing so many of these articles and things alike is because traditional financial institutions feel threatened by the extreme growth and popularity of Bitcoin? What if they are trying to spread 'FUD' in order to maintain their current power?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:28:05
Close but no cigar. 
I've been independent now for about eight years and my mom is actually quite excited about Bitcoin. My dad has a different opinion but he never seems to be happy with my decisions anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:03:58
I've been updating my dad with regard to my gains for many months, he still doesn't believe in Bitcoin and thinks that I'm going to lose all of my money. He often tells me about his gains from invested stocks, can't help but chuckle some. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:01:23
In other terms, invest what you've made from Bitcoin into more traditional investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:08:05
The idea is that each coin will have a particular use in the real world. So while Bitcoin may be used as a store of value, something like Golem (GNT) aims to design a 'supercomputer' (in a sense) by combing idle computer power to create such things as faster rendering times. 
Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology is still in its infancy. I still think it will be many years before we see an asset used in replacement of traditional fiat money for day-to-day transactions, and I'm doubtful that asset will take the form of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:13:39
There's absolutely no telling what might happen. There is a lot of speculation in the market right now, especially as we near the psychological barrier of 10,000.00 USD. After we reach this threshold we could see a significant much-needed correction (20-30%) or we could see the price spike even further. 
We've seen enormous growth this past month alone, with around 100 billion entering the market. Regardless, I think that if we do see a correction Bitcoin will retrace back to 10,000.00 USD and even higher.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:30:33
Like everyone else has said, hodl. We may experience some slight turbulence resulting in a correction or two in the next few days/weeks/months but Bitcoin has proven to always surpass its previous all time high. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:59:54
I would first start with trying to find a source of income. In the mean time familiarize yourself with exchanges and wallets so that when the time comes you know what you're doing. Try to keep up to date with current Bitcoin and cryptocurrency/blockchain news and familiarize yourself with how Bitcoin works.
It is vital that you invest only what you are willing to lose.

The market cap for Bitcoin has increased around 100B this past month alone, giving us a total market cap of around 300B. I'd say things are just beginning to catch on. Hold long term.

God help me, this reminds of Habo hotel. Did I mention I spent 750.00 of my parents money calling in to purchase tokens and club status. Right, well that happened. They weren't to happy with my decisions that month.

Eh mate, I usually use  to purchase my Bitcoin. I typically do the same thing as you, purchase via e-transfer. However I don’t pay much attention to the interest rate. 
There’s much to learn about Bitcoin. I found this series of articles he other day and gives some pretty interesting insights about Bitcoin and historical financial systems. You can find the article(s) here:
