Ya, he lied and didn't get a dime back. LOL. 
I have a similar "Friend". Helped him use Coinbase to invest in ETH. Wanted to buy XRP so I told him to use bittrex. Apparently didn't want any help and paid 1 ETH (at $300ish) for 2.99 XRP, not a mistype.
I love those "friends" that want your help and then decide to go their own way and lose all their money.

Except it takes DAYS for your money to show in GDAX. During that time BTC will rise hundreds, if not a thousand or more dollars. If you buy on Coinbase you get to lock in the purchase price.
My biggest issue with Coinbase is that the buy price on the main page is different from the price on the buy/sell page. It's almost always $30 above the main page/gdax price. My point is that the fee is not really 1.5%

just because a Coinbase account was created DOES NOT mean they spent any money on crytpo, let alone BTC. If the do buy it's normally $25-a few hundred dollars. It's not like 100K users bought 1 BTC each or anything near that.

99% of all crypto use is in exchanges. There is still no real world use for your bitcoins. If your lucky you might find someone that will buy/sell it for actual goods but in the end it is all speculation. If you want to use those bitcoins you have to convert them to FIAT and then buy something. Crypto cards are mostly bullshit too, converting your crypto in FIAT then spending it.


So it's the same as Bitcoin and Altcoins? NOTHING changes about Bitcoin but it just goes up $500-$1000+ per day, Altcoins go up 50%-200%+ in a day with ZERO new features or anything changing with that crypto.

Some people are about to learn why you do not, ever, fuck with the IRS.
You can't just remove your coins from Coinbase. Coinbase will not "Tank" if they hand over the records. That's about the stupidest thing I've heard today. Tell me genius, Where are the maasses going to buy BTC with USDT if coinbase "Tanks"? Everyone going to wire $10K to bittrex each time they want to buy?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:10:17
You might but I doubt it. I really don't see how/why people would want to lose money. Say someone pays you for $600 in electrical work with their personal coins, a week later that $600 in BTC is worth $700. Why spend it when it doesn't lose value but only goes up? Someone could buy BTC just to pay you but I also doubt that when they could just give you cash or a debit card and not have to fuck around with buying and transferring BTC. 
You might try a more stable crypto and convert it to BTC.

Only USD funds held on Coinbase are FDIC insured. Their insurance does not cover user stupidity. You could leave your phone unattended after using coinbase app and someone could transfer all your coins to their own wallets and then your screwed.
If you don't have the passphrase/keys to the wallet where your coins are stored you don't own anything. You should either transfer coins to a wallet if holding or to an exchange if trading.

Except that China NEVER said they were closing exchanges. It was all bullshit. The exchange CLEARLY said they were VOLUNTARILY stopping trading at the end of the month. Next day 2 more exchanges said the same thing and not a single negative change in price (up $1k in less than 18 hours). Crypto needs oversight to stop this crap. Nobody wants it but it's going to get shoved down our throats soon.
Everyone thinks they are going to be rich and all the rich are going to be poor when crypto goes full mainstream.. Who they hell do you think is buying all this shit? Rich people. They will be the ones buying new lambos every day of the week. The will have mad crypto and FIAT in their possession while the plebs (us) have jack shite

Just the 6 coins this guy decided to pick on.
Bittrex has almost 200 coins up and that is not nearly all of them, cryptocompare shows 1130. 
This is just a hand picked list to make someone think that you can just invest in any coin and you will be buying lambos by the end of the year.
The prices appear to be from Oct 3, 2016, it's the past 360 days.

This thread is awesome.
Got dumb asses saying bitcoin was built on anonymity.
Others saying people are stupid for reporting taxes to the IRS. You will never see it coming, it won't be soon but later, but that huge cock of the IRS fucking you will never feel better! In 10 years when they have it figured out and that $250 in taxes you thought was worth lying about has now turned into $25K in penalties, your paychecks are garnished and any money you get automatically goes to them. Have fun
People are now claiming their bitcoins are worthless for tax purposes. Don't worry guys, the IRS can't read or use the internet to find common prices. They are so stupid you can tell them your $5K bitcoin is only worth $4 and they will agree with you and suck your cock!
You guys are way too smart for the IRS and US government.

"Vaulted precious metals"
I can all but guarantee that they have no precious metals in a vault somewhere. If it's anything like traditional gold selling, it's all digital and none of the banks actually have the physical gold to back it up.

As soon as bittrex adds USD deposits smaller than 10K coinbase is going to lose a lot of buyers.
I purchase coins on Coinbase
3 Days later they take my money
7 Days later I finally get my coins while they have had my money for days.
Coinbase shows one price and then when you click on the buy page it's $20 higher than the dashboard price, dashboard price is NEVER the same as the price on the buy page. Coinbase also charges 1.6% on top of the $20. Fees are a lot higher than they say.
And now Coinbase can ignore you on the phone while claiming they have "Support"

Try reading the news instead of reading headlines and posting more FUD. CHINA DID NOT BAN ANY EXCHANGES. The exchange is voluntarily closing on the 30th. China is probably going to try and regulate it.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:28:53
Fees, so much fees. Someone buys $20 and after the ATM fees and bitcoin transaction fees they probably only see $10. Good way to get support for bitcoin. These only seem to support buying BTC with cash and no KYC checks.

Trezor DEFAULTS to segwit accounts. Apparently recovering a segwit wallet is not as simple as using your recover seed. You have to download some third party script that does it. Nowhere does trezor talk about this, I found out about it by looking at and people complaining about empty wallets after a recovery. Most exchanges DO NOT support segwit so you cannot send BTC/LTC to most exchanges if it's in a segwit account.
This is super stupid. Segwit accounts are BETA but trezor decided to use them by default. Im lucky I found out about it before I transferred my BTC and LTC. I am seriously considering selling theis trezor and getting a ledger.
Coinbase stole everyones bitcoin cash and they will do the exact same thing with shitcoin2x. As long as your BTC is in an account you control (you have the seed) then you can split the shitcoin. Trezor will post on their blog how to do it.

    One share of GBTC today would cost you $703.50
    The market value of 0.09258535 Bitcoin is $380.90 today

So publicly traded companies stocks soared AFTER THEY RELEASED EARNING REPORTS.

It's called a scam for a fucking reason, because it is. Just make sure you make your money before it pops.
