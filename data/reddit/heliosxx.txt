Where is he getting 5% interest on that 1.9M? The annual interest on 1.9M at 2% (which is something like 99th percentile of interest return) is 38K.

You've made 20BTC mining at 1.4Gh/s for a month? Or do you have a bunch more BTC that you haven't used?

what mb can you fit two doublewides like that? Are you also doing CPU mining?
@_date: 2011-07-11 18:56:28
I've got exactly the same problem. Between that, and Slush pocketing the coins from block 135263 I'm having some serious concerns.

The explanation doesn't explain the numerous people with coins not showing up into their account. Only those where they couldn't withdraw.

make sure your client is connecting, and not blocked by firewall...  
edit: I accidentally a word.
@_date: 2011-06-18 14:59:52
how many machines (what MB?) did you fit 10 cards into?
@_date: 2011-07-08 01:33:54
still hasn't shown up and no answer to my message, in case you were wondering :)

wow, how're you getting that much out of 6K worth of hardware? The best price/GH/s I can find are the hd6870 series for $200. I figure 3 of them together can crank out under 1.1BTS a day. which is about 2 times less than how well you're doing (22ish dollars a day. you've spent 10X that much, so with no other overhead that's 220$ a day from 6000$ of hd6870s)

What vendors take btc directly?
Also what trade sites did you use?
@_date: 2011-06-16 17:01:58
been trying my hand with hardware I've already got. I'm pushing about 60M/s and that's getting me like .06 btc per day. you're doing 10X that but getting 20X the return Wonder if there's some loss with lower speeds...

that's the exact sort of thing I need to hear, thanks! Why am I already downvoted? Anyway.
Yes, it seems to say that my wallet number has received it. It doesnt' show on mybitcoin.com though
@_date: 2011-07-07 01:31:23
Others have shown up within 30 minutes. 3 days seems a bit much. But yeah, I sent them a message a few hours ago.

I was just extrapolating from what I was getting. Those numbers look about right. Does that also mean the dollar worth goes up? That is, is the Mhs about stable per dollar?
