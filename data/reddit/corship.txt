All it takes is ppl hodl the shit out of it until it gets forgotten and no one wants them anymore, then the price will drop

Especially not fool-proof secure.
Https is a good example, it's what I would consider fool-proof secure because the actual end user doesn't habe to do anything at all except having the right time set on their PC (that's propably done automatically too)

You're making promises you can not provide.
They are based on cryptography so that's what they actually are, but all of them have their flaws so they are not secure. Maybe better than paper money but well it's just not what they are.

I love it when people promote it as currency and the next meme is a hodl meme

Kinda everyone should buy a battery, a solar panel and a pi set him up for mining and let him run. No real upkeep costs, but you can still sleep knowing you did you bitcoin duty to keep it up and running.

Protecting bitcoin, verifying transaction, working against inflation. You did your part to keep bitcoin running.

What?

And they have to have capital, you don't.

Besides the comment already given, there is a scenario where one node controls more than 50% of the mining power. 
This node can then double spend bitcoins etc.
In fact this would lead to a loss of trust and thus hyper inflation. Bitcoin would almost instantly be worthless

Imagine it like this:
The highest fees are going to get verified at first. So if you put on the highest fee currently on the market your transaction will be propably verified as fast as possible. (it is possible to choose an option to not verify the highest but the oldest transaction).
But this also means by doubling the fee, you may won't get the double speed, or even more than the double speed depending on the range you are.

Children should not be involved in high risk investments /trades.
You don't want to explain cfd trading to the either

Telephony had some things to consider before
Like bandwidth etc
Plus still no database has replaced my newspaper

I dunno man, but I feel like this isn't very helpful.... 
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:30:16
I see. I never understood what those fakers wanna achieve with it. Like do they think everyone will obey Satoshi?

The argument bitcoin certainly won't loose all its value because ppl are now more interested than earlier doesn't affect the fact there is a very small chance of it reaching 100k.
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:58:01
But why, does it even matter? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:23:43

Well 1 miles is possible. But so super unlikely that it isn't worth the risk.
Just as winning the lottery is possible, but you'll loose in the average case
