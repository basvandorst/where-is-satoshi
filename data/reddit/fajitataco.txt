So I buy 100$ worth of bitcoin, with your logic in 4 years it will be x10 that. Cool i made 1k in 4 years!. How about pushing it to buying 1k.. 10k in four years...It's just not a good investment and that's supposing that it will reach 50k in 4 years! (P.S. It won't go past 19k ever again, media hype is gone). 
People believe they will get rich with bitcoin but fail to realize that only happened to the people to bought it dirt cheap or had a lot mined years ago. There's literally tons of better ways to invest your money, this is just stupid.

And why do I need that? I still don't see how that answers the question

You do know these places adjust the bitcoin price of their products to match the product USD price right? And they sell the bitcoin right after the transaction for USD, they never keep the bitcoin. That ain't adoptation that's just marketing, getting more clients.

Look dude the problem is, Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, not something that should be traded for profit. Of course it has worked before, but that was all price manipulation by the media, bitcoin was introduced to the world, it peaked and it will never rise again because people won't buy it again the same way they did in Late 2017.
Trying to live just by trading bitcoin is pure gambling, in that case get into trading other stuff, which Is also a gamble but at least you know it's not dead like bitcoin. 
Cmon people down vote me but this is the reality you guys in this sub won't accept.

I also feel like him and I bet most people as well, we want auto payments and subscriptions, it's comfortable.

Just sell it man, for real usable money. Bitcoin is useless and won't ever go back up

Okay "Playboy_BTC" keep "investing" in a dead currency, I wish you the best.

Cryptocurrency is not over, I believe in it. 
In the other hand, bitcoin is, there is no real benefit to use it compared to others, "mass adoption that will occur", i invite you to google the number of places that have STOPPED accpeint bitcoin already.
