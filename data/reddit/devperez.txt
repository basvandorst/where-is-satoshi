Doesn't Chase already do this?
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:10:27
Not much it seems. Ha
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:19:15
Can anyone fill me in on what's going on here?
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:00:51
What's LN?
It's awesome how inhospitable this could community is. I legitimately didn't know what LN was. And because of that, I got downvoted. Awesome.
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:07:01
The memes have begun...
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:04:18
And the mobile app.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:09:42
Why would we want to feed 75 people when half a bitcoin can feed 150?^^^^^MURICA
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:10:14


That's pretty much what the article said.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:55:17


You mean precedent, right?
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:55:44
You can already mine it. This date is when they do the "air drop", not when the coin is released.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:06:32
That's what the article said.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:05:14
It's not real. [This]( is the real message.
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:20:26
But the foundation pays the core devs to keep working on the client, right?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:21:15
Have you not seen /new?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:09:26
Not only does that article **not** say they're insolvent, going down doesn't mean they are.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:40:54
Google+ is a lot better than the other two. Especially since it can be auto created from your GMail account. Super quick and easy.
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:16:23
Why not just shadowban the bot with automoderator?
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:40:14
Exchanges aren't banks. People have been trying to tell others that for years.
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:22:09
3 months. Not bad.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:44:18
The "murica" was to indicate that it was a joke.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:04:41
How is Webflow? I heard mixed info during the beta.
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:53:59
50% of the coins are already mined. You can mine AUR now, but the difficulty is crazy high already. There's only a couple of pools, but I mined for over 12 hours at &gt;600 kh/s and am still waiting for 2.7 coins to confirm.
For whatever reason, they're waiting until the March date to release the coins. Maybe they need help. On their website, they mention they need developers.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:22:09
No. It means the database records indicates they do. The problem was that the records didn't match up with the wallets
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:39:46
Because it's easier to blame others 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:19:46
Good job on not feeding the panic /s
@_date: 2014-09-17 23:32:03


I'm sure the person who runs the bot actually logs into the account every now and then. Or they could easily send an alert to the owner when a ban message is received. It's not rocket science.
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:56:33
It's not a text file. It's a special database. I forget the name. But when I looked it up, there wasn't a ready made solution for that DB in C
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:14:02
I wonder how much longer he can blame the Bitcoin protocol for this massive screw up.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:58:09
No is the answer you're looking for. Everyone is spreading FUD by claiming rumors as fact. Gox has given no official word on their insolvency.
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:10:24
Doge is currently a very profitable coin. It's the reason why the value is decreasing so quickly. People are quickly mining hundreds of thousands of coins and dumping them.
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:51:50
If you think this is bad, never ever visit @_date: 2014-12-22 19:29:49


Don't do this. That's just some click bait bullshit.
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:54:52
Their website says they "have ways" of identifying true citizens. So we'll just need to see.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:58:03
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:27:19
I'm confused. Doesn't it take 10 minutes to verify a transaction? How could they have known it was a legitimate transaction?
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:01:31
What are the tax implications of short term vs. long term capital gains?
And why weren't you able to qualify it for long term?
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:14:48
His explanation is "because it is." It's best to ignore guys like this.
**EDIT** I'm saying bitcoin isn't a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:20:39
If they get insurance for the vault, then it'd be worth it.
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:50:50
I thought the addresses were stored in the wallet. But, I guess I could have the app make the user enter the wallet address.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:57:47
Why would you tell her they're gone before knowing for sure?
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:46:59
Ugh... and so it starts.
* There's been no confirmed reports that Mt.Gox is insolvent. You can freak out when we have solid info.
* Exchanges aren't banks. People have been saying this for years.
* Start diversifying and mining other coins.
Good luck.
@_date: 2014-09-12 02:10:41
I didn't say admin shadowban. I said automoderator shadowban. It will delete their comments as soon as they're posted, so they won't know it's gone, but no one will see it.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:11:55
Huh. It still has [.01 BTC]( in it for some reason.
Oh. Someone *sent* them the BTC. Weird...
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:41:21
About what? Nothing has changed yet. I double checked all info to see if anything had changed. Everything looks the same.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:20:14
This has been posted many times already
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:40:06
I'd settle for Google+.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:57:29


I have a coworker who thinks the same thing. I don't understand why people think it's a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:43:17
You're taking more speculation as fact?
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:42:21
They do hold, but a small amount. Most of it is instantly converted to USD via their provider.
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:56:34
You can't be sure right now. So hold off, just in case. I will provide this information tonight.
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:39:52
Probably to make it seen like it was an issue with Bitcoin itself and not a problem they caused
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:35:08
Thanks for the information. I downloaded the code and started to look through it. However, it doesn't look like it supports viewing wallet data from your local machine. It looks like it's more designed to view the information from a pool.
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:03:39
Nothing. It's pure speculation.
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:22:17
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:23:15
It's up
@_date: 2014-07-20 03:42:18
Your link is dead.
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:21:39
You bet your sweet ass! I wonder if they'll do something special for when we hit 100K. We're just about half way there, and only a month old.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:39:27
More speculation being taken as official word?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:44:08
I'm refreshing new like a maniac. So much popcorn.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:37:21
At least 3
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:21:49
Ah. Gotcha. Thanks
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:14:42
RemindMe! One Year
For the giggles
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:11:20
I'd be willing to bet a good chunk of that isn't liquid.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:49:04
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:59:06
Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:05:20
Because, like stocks, the price may never get that high again.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:11:25
[Any second now](
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:06:01
Hyperbole, man. $19,891 is close enough.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:13:01
Unless you bought in at 20K. Then you're still not quite happy
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:03:52
Money is given out during Lunar New Years. I'm sure a lot of young people are purchasing crypto with their money. And Lunar New Years is actually celebrated by a bunch of Asian cultures. So there's more than just the Chinese affecting the markets, I'm sure.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:17:47
It's been a month and I'm still waiting ��
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:54:50
As mentioned, it's consumed by many Asian cultures. My wife is Vietnamese and her whole family loves balut. That may or may not have something to do with China reigning over Vietnam for nearly a thousand nears, at one point.
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:47:05
They created Petro and would probably want their people to buy that instead. But that just perpetuates the current issue.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:10:43
Do you still have the HDD? There are many companies that can get data from restore HDDs. It might be worth it to go that route. Especially with how much they're worth now.
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:52:24
To be fair, anyone can add a definition for any reason.
For example, a few years ago I added [Fake Artificial Intelligence]( to screw around with a guy who was totally convinced that he had made AI software.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:26:02
Did you pay taxes on the funds?
@_date: 2013-08-17 17:19:56
AdBlock is showing me that it blocked 9 ads.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:08:47
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:06:49
Now, if they'd only implement LTC...
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:21:43
People were saying the same about BTC not too long ago
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:01:11
Great job, man. This is a great service.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:39:36
Absolutely. Which is why I was asking.
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:11:59
It's been so long since I've read that stuff. That guy is completely insane.
[Here's]( the thread where he tries to show it off and everyone tell's him he's crazy.
There's some YouTube videos in there, of him showing off his software. It's crazy. But a fun read.
