I bought a friends daughter a Bitcoin (or half? Can’t recall) when they were $30 each. I think she sold when it was near the top. Damn good present

Quantum computing.
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:09:04
The moment it exists- it will be over for non-quantum crypto. 30 seconds before that, everything will seem just fine. So you’re only worried after that first second?  It’s not going to be a slow technology adoption that happens over decades. When it breaks- it will break fast and hard

I don't know what gates you think will be just waiting for "steal government secrets" to happen. That...isn't how it works. Do you work in security, quantum and or crypto?

Sure; but when you build your house, you wanna make sure you're putting it on a good foundation. If in 2029 they can break the hashing on this trially using quantum computing, then if the economy moved 100% to Bitcoin... well, that would be bad. I hope they could make a quantum fork of it, and everyone would adopt that, but who knows.

No more than tales of your great-grandparents buying a house for $2,000USD. Currency values change over time.

Is that how you generally treat risk? Seems incredibly short sighted. Quantum computers aren't some fantasy-technology. You can go use one right now, from your computer. They are getting bigger and bigger each year. Once they hit enough qubits, it's game over.

It seems to be a problem though when the stated goals/value of the currency change just within a few years. 
Buying pizza, coffee, etc... anything retail? Forget about it. Even registering your domain name for $10? Skip on BTC.
I initially thought that since BTC was divisible to 1 satoshi (1/millionth of a BTC) that it could be great for micro things. That time has passed seemingly.  
Fortunately, we do have altcoins and such for this, but it seems that if *any* of the coins that are currently popular got as used a Visa or Mastercard for daily transactions they'd fail to scale (if there is one that will work, let me know... I might be wrong here).

| In short, you're taking a great concept, and trying to profit from it for your own selfish reasons.
What reasons does anyone else have for interacting with Bitcoin that's better? Is (semi) anonymity the only valid reason to use Bitcoin? No, people are trying to make money here- lots of people.

While I'm sure it *could* still be taken down, for front-page stuff, I'd try putting up some Varnish servers on EC2 that auto-scale based on CPU loading. Of course then your load balancer could fall over too, but if you have multiple of those up as well with round-robin DNS. In case of a DDOS that still takes down your load balancer, repoint your DNS over to an S3/Cloudfront page that gives a graceful error. 
Of course, this will *not* give you any dynamic functionality on the site, but at least provides some minimal experience. 
Also, reject IP addresses that become 'abusive' using [rack-attack! from Kickstarter]( Of course the IPs are probably a distributed botnet, but it should still (mostly) work.

Because part of Bitcoin is that its pretty much infinitely divisible. In the future, that might be like allowing only $10,000 T-Bills to trade.

I'm kinda shocked at MtGox's response to this. It just doesn't seem professional. I understand why they can't do much, but still- they could act a bit better about it. 
@_date: 2013-06-29 14:56:53
That's nice. Will believe when they start shipping reliably. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:06:33
Its an arms race. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:20:39
A poorly configured server setup at that. Put Varnish in front of it, and have it serve stale pages at least while if the backend servers fall over.  
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:36:03
Hitting the front page of a site should *never* DDOS it if the people who wrote the page have any idea what they are doing.

There's always someone who is benefitting from being in early. See: those who bought Manhattan for almost nothing. Doesn't kill the demand for it later.
