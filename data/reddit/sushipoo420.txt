If you're going to troll please explain, how does any of this sound exploitative.  I'm a 10 year combat Veteran with two tours in Iraq.  We also have 2 other combat Veterans on the team.  Who are you to say that people who are trying to do good for others are "exploitative" without reason.  
You have no idea who we are or what we have done, what have you done for your country? probably squat.  Seriously some of you need to grow up.

I kinda know what you mean also.  I saw a guy pull out some Medical Cannabis from a old school sandwich baggie and I was like WTF!?!

It is and we're serious about helping Veterans

It's not off topic as we're an online Collective only taking crypto as in Bitcoin.

Put aside what you think about the military or U.S. Government and click that link above and see what the faces of those who serve look like.  Probably look a lot like people you know.

remember this is the early days of cannabis legalization and it has to start somewhere right?  In the next few years it'll be just like that where you wont need to hand over any identifying info.  Just verify age and go.  But this is MEDICAL Marijuana NOT Recreational.

I agree, Go Trees! Go GGG!
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:34:07
bro, GGG has been actually accepting bitcoin since April when they "soft launched"
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:27:04
Show me the OFFICIAL regulations on cannabis delivery services in CA and I'll "Buy" your "consulting" service, but you can't because there are none.
It's up to the Private courier to decide what they will ship and not.  
Gov. Jerry Brown just signed bills that would make medical marijuana legal in CA officially by 2016 but only because there is pressure to legalize in 2016 and i'm 100% sure it will happen in CA next year.
You better believe because with legalization cannabis becomes one of the top 5 biggest industries in CA.  Do you not think that courier companies and credit card companies are not having backroom talks about cannabis and their plans?  bahahaha it will be an instant legal billion dollar industry.  Even for shipping and credit cards.
@_date: 2015-10-27 05:11:27
I think they might be the first in terms of seriousness of bitcoin acceptance.  Maybe a few smaller local dispensaries or delivery services but nothing like this.
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:22:13
you're absolutely right and I hope all that nonsense changes soon.  We're on the same page bro, but legally it has to be done this way in California currently online or in the dispensaries or else GGG is in violation of the laws.
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:44:23
Brother,  It hasn't been legal since the 90s. It was decriminalized for medical use but not OFFICIALLY as there were no Regulating authority.  Just a patchwork of laws and up to the Judges personal opinion on if you go to jail or not.  I had Civil asset forfeiture applied to me by local police trying to steal my money, do you see police doing that for legal TVs or legal microwaves?  TBH bro with comments like that I wouldn't use your consulting service if I were the last dispensary on earth.
@_date: 2015-10-27 15:36:27
Bitcoin does not mean you have to be anonymous.  It's just a simple payment solution for the internet.  Period.
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:51:28
their flower selection and price is good though.  I'm sure waxes and shatter will come soon.
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:55:42
you talking about those guys on weedmaps?  Bro the biggest names in the cannabis industry DON'T even list on weedmaps anymore because they get massive traffic through other sources to their main dispensaries.
what do those links prove?  That was a real comment from a real weedmaps client for GGG.  
you must be stupid, who do you think is waiting?  This site is obviously live.  
Edit: sorry, ill take that back maybe you're not stupid, I don't know you.   But these opinions and things your spouting off to make yourself look like a better "consultant" are stupid.
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:01:20
Well anyone in the state of California has to give up their driverslicense and REC to the dispensary you are using anyways regardless of if you are paying cash or any other form of payment.  It's just the state requirement.
If if make you happier, Target and Ashley maddison lost more of everyones private information than a small time cannabis website during the great years of legislation.  LOL
I 100% sure in a few years nobody will be discussing the "safety" of ordering cannabis online.  
These arguments are as useless as the ones I heard saying "why would anyone want to buy stuff on the internet when I can go to wal-mart down the street"  but you dont hear anyone saying that phrase anymore do you.
@_date: 2015-10-27 15:41:04
actually look at the date these sites were launched, you'll see GGG was accepting bitcoin before trees.  Trees has more advertising money and stupid advertising tactic as amazon with bogus "drone" delivery videos lol.  GGG just sends you Amazing pot minus the cost for expensive personalized cardboard boxes and crap.
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:34:23
yes technically because it does not cross state borders to make it a federal offense.  The DEA is blocked from using tax funds for going after LEGITIMATE medical cannabis operators now.
@_date: 2015-10-28 19:45:06
the best.  I've tried them all and absolute xtracts is top notch.  Now there are private "connoisseur" brands like shatter tanks that reach like 80%-95% THC but expensive. on the line of about $45-$55 per 600mg and use shatter from award winning groups.
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:13:58
so you're saying that because you go to one place that they are the only ones who are going to have the "BEST" Medicine?  last time I checked there were AMAZING Growers all over Cali and not everyone supplies Trees.  Obvious advantage being there are more choices and that they carry over 22 High quality strains and a line of high quality oil cartridges. Another advantage?  You don't have to spend $150 minimum to get your meds. Should I go on? I didn't go into the Trees drone reddit and say Hey fuck trees no point come to GGG even though I could have because they were already online.  So please don't do it here and try to steal their thunder.
