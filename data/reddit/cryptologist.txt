If Bernanke didn't agree with Blinder's point, he wouldn't describe it as a "key point." 
Clearly, he is paraphrasing blinder's "key point" partially because he agrees with it.

The proposal shouldn't be "inflationary" in any traditional sense.

This is immature. If you really think traditional asset classes are as risky as something like Bitcoin, you're delusional.

Skip to 22:10 where he mentions a luncheon with an 'investment bank.'
Didn't Michele Burns, a Goldman board member, join Circle's board a couple weeks ago? I wonder which 'Investment Bank' could have organized that luncheon..hmm..

Just curious, how does the terminal verify that a receipt was payed after it scans the QR code?

You can't 'double' the amount of coins. The number of core units, currently denoted 'bitocoins' that will be created will be 21,000,0000. It doesn't matter what you call it, only 21,000,000 will be created. Any change in naming conventions would be purely nominal. Please correct me if I am missing something.
The problem of inflation would only arise in so far as prices and contacts couldn't immediately adjust.

Something to consider as Jamie talks down Bitcoin:
Skip to 22:10 in the video below where Jeremy Allaire, found of Circle, mentions a luncheon with an 'investment bank.'
Didn't Michele Burns, a Goldman board member, join Circle's board a couple weeks ago? I wonder which 'Investment Bank' could have organized that luncheon...
So as Jamie talks down Bitcoin, Goldman is organizing luncheons for their clients exploring the topic, and having one of their board members use her limited time to actively participate in a Bitcoin startup.
Just something for James to think about.

I love BTC entrepreneurism. But I can't get too excited about new start-ups who don't reveal the identity of management and founders. Would you accept such anonymity from a banking institution or other business?

Actually, they finally did split one class of shares: BRK.B are $115 per share. 
And the idea is for bitcoin to be used as a currency. Berkshire shares, particularly the A shares that are unsplit, are not used as a medium of exchange.

Thank you for sharing this. It sounds like the people you interacted with simply do not have that much experience with women. Which is not all too surprising given that you met them at a Bitcoin Meetup.

I see that. I was able to find you guys with some digging, but why not put it on your site?

You're right. I think it was just the first half of one of the shows during the week Bitcoin hit an ATH -they were probably just a little bit more giddy and care free than usual. They eventually got into more technical aspects later on into the show. I definitely can see its value as a source of information on the protocol, cryptocurrencies generally, etc..

Meh, just one dude with an opinion. He may be a good trader, but there isn't a market if there aren't different opinions.

You are going to teach students that "speculation could be money making"? Is there a "right way" to speculate on bubbles? Not saying bitcoin is a bubble, but it seams that you are implying that there is a right way to speculate on momentum trading, which seems like something silly to teach children. Probably better to teach them that creating something "could be money making."
