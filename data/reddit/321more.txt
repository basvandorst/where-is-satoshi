Do not go to coinbase! Its easy to use but they tax you about 4% on you exchange (both from dollars/bitcoin and bitcoin/dollars).

Being honest I don't know. I started out on coinbase but when I realised how much of my money I would be spending on fees I switched to Kraken. You pay for the convenience with coinbase. It's easy to use and a quick way to get started but if ou wanna get serious with crypto I think you should spend time learning to use some other sites.

Yeah Im not hearing great things about that - especially bitcoin! I love crypto as an investment but I'm a long way from actually using it as a currency.

You pay what? 4% everytime you make an order? That is fucking insane and can be done much cheaper almost anywhere else.

I have nothing against gdax. I just think it's really ill-advised to use throw some money in Coinbase and use there standard setup (or their app) because you wanna get in on bitcoin as fast as possible.

Guess that's a little better but honestly that is still way too much for me.
