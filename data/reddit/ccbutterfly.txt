 Just wanted to say thank you again.  The poster arrived a few days ago and it is even more amazing than the photo. 
Happy New Year and thanks a bunch!

I've posted repeatedly about my stuck BTC transaction and today I have a happy update.  Please forgive me if you see this posted more than once, but it only seems fair to go back and update everywhere that I previously posted about my dilemma.  Skip to the bottom if you want the TL;DR without the details of how I came to fix my stuck TX.
So originally, my transaction was sent from my BreadWallet to Binance on the night of 12/8.  In the process, Bread offered me a lower transaction fee of $1.49 (92 satoshi IIRC) stating that it would take 1-24 hours rather than "up to 60 minutes" for the full-price tx fee of $11.49.  I wasn't in a huge hurry, so I decided to save $10 and wait an extra day.
To my dismay, the fee was too low and the transaction was not picked up in the blockchain that day.  Or the next.  Or the next.  Etc.  My transaction was stuck.  I have since learned that higher-fee transactions are skimmed off the top, and my transaction was probably never going to be picked up.
Over the next week, I studied-up about tx accelerators (free and paid), RBF and CPFP.  I attempted these various methods several times with the following results:
1) Transaction accelerators (FREE) -- Did not work.
2) Transaction accelerators (PAID) -- Fee was several hundred dollars.  A huge percentage of the stuck transaction.  Not really a viable option for me.  Did not attempt.
3) RBF and CPFP - Since I was sending the BTC from a wallet to an exchange, I did not have the proper Private Key of the recipient which is needed in order to initiate the RBF or CPFP transactions.  (I’m not sure if RBF was ever really an option but I kind of doubt it).  I tried everything I could think of, but without the private key on the receiving end, nothing worked.  Reminder:  If you don't hold the key, it's not your bitcoin.  You can't even redirect it if you have the sending Private Key and are sending it to yourself on an exchange.  At least that was my personal experience.
4) Contact Breadwallet Support -- Put in a ticket.  No response.  No surprise.  
5) Wait and see.  -- 11 long days later, still waiting.
After all this uncertainty, tonight I got my bitcoin "unstuck."  I am currently celebrating my victory and the relief it has brought.  It very well may have been a fluke, but just in case, I want to share what I did.  Maybe it will help even ONE person with a stuck transaction.
It started like this:  I logged in to Breadwallet to check the status as I do many times a day.  Only this time it said, "Transaction rejected" and my full BTC amount showed in my balance.
I shouted a quick HOORAY! and then began to brainstorm how I could quickly move the money (with a proper fee) and get it out of this wallet once and for all.
Within sixty seconds, Bread refreshed the screen and resubmitted my transaction.  It was pending again.  It was never going to get picked up with that low fee.  I actually thought I was going to vomit.
So I took a deep breath and started trying to think of how I could replicate the rejected transaction long enough for me to move it somewhere very quickly.  I had the idea that maybe uninstalling and reinstalling the Breadwallet would do the trick, so I decided to give it a try.  I lined everything up first.  I created a paper wallet address and had it copied - ready to paste. (Any other receiving address would have worked just as well.)  Then I uninstalled Breadwallet. 
I reinstalled the wallet and right away it showed my btc balance as available rather than in a pending transaction.  Great news!  I very QUCKLY  sent the BTC to my paper wallet before it had a chance to resubmit the original transaction.  The fee was VERY HIGH (around $40) but at this point, that was pretty much irrelevant.
And it worked.  Within minutes the transaction began to confirm and within the hour, it was 100% complete.  After 11 days of uncertainty, I now have control of my BTC again.  WHAT A RELIEF!
This may not be the solution for everyone in this predicament, but just maybe it will help someone.  Believe me, I fully and completely understand the stress that comes with having even a small amount of BTC in limbo and not sure if it will ever reconcile.
I wish you all the best - and for those who achieve success, I've already celebrated with you :)
Here's to live-and-learn.  No more low fees, no matter what.
TL;DR:  My BTC has been stuck for 11 days.  When I uninstalled and reinstalled my Breadwallet, I had a very small window of opportunity to send my BTC (with a proper fee) to an alternate location before Bread automatically resubmitted the transaction.  After much strife for the past week and a half, this worked for me.  I finally have control of my BTC again.  I sincerely hope it works for others.

Awesome! Thanks!  I emailed you my info.  Have a great week!
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:37:38
I'm 48 and they restricted me for being under age. Had to re-verify. Now it's crickets on their end.
I think their software is flagging accounts faster than they can correct it. 
Just MHO. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:43:07
Maybe we should start some hashtag like  or just anything to let people know they can buy in at $20 or $100 or any reasonable amount. 
The world needs to know that buying 
.00000001 is still buying bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:07:11
I have no doubt there are many but the first rule of BTC is you don't tell what you have. 
I will say, for clarification, that I only dabble and haven't been in the game forba year yet so I definitely am not in the category you asked about. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:23:33
Congratulations! Now you’re free. Good move. Save up, buy more and do it again - this time without the debt. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:29:59
That difference is very close to the fee I just paid. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:58:29
Are you sure?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:30
WTF is happening?!  I'm literally shaking!
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:28:39
It’s like being hypnotized. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:23:19
IIUC, it's not a capital gain until and unless you cash out to fiat. If that's true, the calculation becomes a lot easier. For example, I  bought in with $1000. I cashed out $5,000. My capital gain is $4,000 regardless of how much trading I did to get there or how long it took. 
I hope someone with a better understanding will either confirm or correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:52:46
I am definitely glad! I have to make a conscious effort not to wish I hadn't bought the VPN though. Once I realized the growth I probably should have left the $100 in there, but hey,that's all part of getting BTC to be more widely accepted. I consider it my personal contribution, lol.
I'm not even going to calculate how much my VPN is worth now, haha. Somewhere around $1000 I guess. Oh well. It's all good. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:54:04
Yep. I first bought in April then it went crazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:14:53
Meanwhile I've been stuck since 12/8. Grr. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:14:11
Still basically a noob here. Bought my first btc less than a year ago. I was shopping for a VPN and saw BTC offered frequently as a payment option. I don't think that was my first exposure to it (I think TPB may have been where I first saw it) but that's when I first checked it out.  
I decided to use my VPN purchase as a way to try it out and see how it all works. 
So I bought $100 of BTC to use for the VPN.  The price of BTC was $900-something at the time. 
I used Coinbase, so I had to wait for the tx to clear and I actually forgot about it for a while. Then when I realized I still needed a VPN, I went to Coinbase and saw that my $100 had seriously grown. I was like, "Whoa! What the heck!"
So I bought the vpn service and still had about $30 left in my account. Free money.  I just left it there and I've been watching it grow, adding to it occasionally. 
More fun than a real life roller coaster. 
I recently bought and ETH and have a little BTG and BCH by default. 
TL;DR - Bought first BTC less than a year ago to use for a VPN. The price was still three digits then. Found out by accident how fast the value was growing and now I'm hooked. First heard of it by surfing online, probably on TPB. 
Edit: lots of corrections and stuff.

Not arguing the validity of this, but honestly it's the first time I've heard it.  Have heard it my way many times.  Do you have a source? 
(Oh and are we all speaking about US taxes?)

LOL 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:54:03
That's how I originally got started. I bought BTC to use for a VPN because I just wanted to feel out the process. So glad I did.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:47:08
"Welcome back, El.  Good to see you again."
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:27:33
At first they would respond (eventually) but since I re-verified weeks ago I haven't been able to get any response. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:37:05
Awesome!  Thanks for the link!
It says they're over the limit right now but I'll definitely try again later.
Update:  i found another similar site and was able to submit there.  (confirmtx)  Fingers crossed!
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:41:50
Definitely going to look at that this morning.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:33:27
I'm not flattered anymore. I re-verified everything and I'm still restricted.  What a PITA. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:43
Hang on. You’re breaking up. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:27:21
This is going to be fun since I used btc to buy other coins. LOL. Oh well. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:47:15
Put in a limit order last night that should have filed. I didn't get an email so I'm guessing it didn't. Ugh. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:57:13
Same.  Waiting 2-3 days now.  I guess I'd better get comfy; looks like I could be at 2 for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:12:06
10 days for me (And counting).  94 sat fee.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:34:34
I'm excited to be in early enough to watch BTC go mainstream and eventually be considered an early adopter even though I bought in at $900-something. 
Welcome to the club!
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:17:50
I was watching like whoa......
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:49:50
Well, that was exactly when I bought in, so you're welcome. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:24:25
My account is currently restricted due to being under age 18. (If only that were true.). I verified my ID initially and re-verified after being restricted but they no longer respond to my support tickets. 
This started 31 days ago. 
This is not a place I really trust with my money, tbh. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:33:21
I want the $.01 BTC t-shirt. Haha
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:29:25
Man I wish I'd forgotten something like that LOL. I bought BTC right after I heard about it, but it wasn't all that early. It WAS still three digits then, though which makes me happy. 
Congrats on your found money. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:08:48
Are you confusing Coinable and Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:23:17
I can only offer the fact that I also have a stuck "send" transaction through Bread which was initiated on 12/8. The same evening I received two BTC transactions with no issues. 
Same boat. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:55:14
Not a chance. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:13:38
Gave BTC to my four sons for Christmas. Would love to commemorate our family investment this way. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:10:45
I think you've mixed up Coinbase and Coinable. Everyone else is taking about Coinbase but you (OP) keep referring to Coinable. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:02:35
When it was $900/BTC. New, but not a noob. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:25:33
My stuck transaction keeps resubmitting automatically every so often, but never gets picked up due to a low fee. I don't think it's going to get rejected because it's never going to sit still for two weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:47:07
Nothing is too ridiculous IMO.  We have no idea where this could go.  Once all the coin has been mined, it seems like the price will go even higher because there will be growing demand but no more additional bitcoin.  It seems that it could become extremely in-demand.
Ten years = anything could happen.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:52:23
I’m having exactly the same issue with Coinbase. Grr. 
I've been using Gemini and it's been great so far as long as you only want to dabble in bitcoin and etherium.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:26:56
I've seen this addressed in the FAQs or support page on their site. I didn't use it myself so I don't know what the instructions were but you should be able to find it with no problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:35:30
One great thing about btc - you don't have to hang in there long before it turns itself around. If I could just remember not to sweat when I'm buying at yard sale prices. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:22:11
Just checked on it  - not confirmed yet / no change. 
But the site says most are confirmed within 2 hours and all are confirmed within 72 hours. 
I believe they will get it done. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:45:03
Thanks. I appreciate the info.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:09:00
A few more days till mine gets here. 
Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:22:34
A dip is nice, and can be useful, but not when GDAX, Gemini and Coinbase are all DOWN.  What in the world is going on???
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:33:25
You'll need to clearly define what is considered swearing. Some words are borderline. i.e. Is piss on your list?  (Sorry, Hall &amp; Oates) Or just the basics?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:14:46
That is correct. HODL is customizable so you can choose which coins you want to see. I like it so far. 
I sound like a commercial. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:41:34
Took my breath away for a second.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:17
I know I can't sleep, but I think it's funny that the ones who did go to sleep are going to be like WTF when they see what happened overnight, LOL.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:32:07
That depends on if you want to pay $7k or $10k or more?
$7k is still a bargain. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:43:10
Ouch!  
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:15:39
I posted this right after you did. Might have been simultaneous had I not showed my pic to a family member first. Haha. Well, great minds....
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:38:29
*Granted. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:30:31
Do you want $200 today or $2,000 later?  It really is your choice.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:08:57
Hey, at least half the folks who speak English as their first language f- that up. LOL
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:39:14
Well, in that case, my idea might not work. LOL
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:42
Which exchange?  (Who's NOT down???)
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:04:24
Same. LOL
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:24:18
Thanks, “Vegeta” but I meant in the U.S. lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:24:18
That does say USD but it's def not!
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:34:19
You lost me at “...it has no other use...”
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:09:19
LOL.  Yeah, that didn't work.  Now my account is restricted. Fair warning to others. 
And when I submitted a support ticket, they said it may be several weeks before they can address it.  Just my luck.  
Thankfully they're not my only option and they don't have any of my coins.  :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:11:01
Great advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:40:13
I bought in the dip even though it was still the most I've ever paid, lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:18
Same.  Even registered with a 4th site and it's down, too.  Grr.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:47
It's the most frustrating thing ever.  I keep thinking it's probably the last chance to buy more at 4 digits -- and I can't get in.  ::sigh::

BTC wouldn't be what it is today if we hadn't spent some of it in the early days. I remind myself of that whenever I think of how I originally bought it to USE it. :sigh:  It was a small investment in BTC's future.

This is HODL app for iOS. (You can choose which coins you want to watch).

I'm not usually one to scream "conspiracy" and yet here we are ... (I sure would like to buy ... but ho-hum ...)

I watch pricing in the HODL app. I can pick which coins I want to watch.

Can't buy when the exchanges are down :(

Wowsers.  Just registered with them and then got this message when trying to buy BTC:  
Due to maintenance on other exchanges we are not able to trade or sell this cryptocurrency."
Now registered in 4 places and can't buy.  Seems shady.

Thanks for the gold anonymous user!  It’s a great day!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:10:10
Thanks for the help, though.  I didn't even know about that site.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:23:58
That is correct. HODL is customizable so you can choose which coins you want to see. I like it so far. 
I sound like a commercial.

Real life events are coming up to introduce newbies to the market (TBBT bitcoin episode on 11/30 and all the holiday parties, gatherings and dinners in December that will no doubt include BTC in their small talk.)
I believe we're on a long UP coaster.  I stopped hoping for a dip and I'm just looking forward to seeing where we're going from here.  
I ain't skeered of no dip.  LOL

Shared this post to Twitter (  Now I've gotta go get my keys from Coinbase. Hope this gets resolved quickly for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:17
Coinbase/GDAX and Gemini are down. I thought I had my Plan A and Plan B, but they're all down.  Feels shady to me, tbh.

That’s not the moon.
But it’s a nice place to visit on the way there. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:29:25
Show them the yearly chart. That seems to get a lot of attention. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:39:55
Yep. Expecting another huge escalation on and after 11/30. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:53
Someone suggested Litebit -- registered there and then got the same type of message:
Due to maintenance on other exchanges we are not able to trade or sell this cryptocurrency.
Another site bites the dust.  How is anyone else able to buy (unless they had a limit order in place already)

Caught it just before it broke $10k and the wall came tumbling down. [That sell wall tho]( 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:29:58
Tell them that’s what you want for Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:27:02
It was funny till they froze my account. WTH?!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:18:09
Yeah, I see what you mean. If it's done, it really bounced back fast. 
I wish we knew the answer to your question. With  BTC there's just no telling. 
And my 18yo son is in the same boat you are. He got paid on Friday but the amount of his check was  $0.00.   He's new (paid intern at his university) and this is his third check. All $0.00.  They fixed the first two and then the third was still messed up. So yeah, he's hoping it hangs low for a minute.
Hope you get to buy a little before it heads to the moon. :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:41:37
Hang on while I check my magic 8 ball. LOL
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:25:07
Haha, no way -- totally not your fault.  I only posted it in case anyone else was going through it.
It did work, in a sense.  It let me in, let me add and verify another payment method, then asked me to verify my email, which I did.  THEN it restricted my account.  No idea what happened.  Very, very weird, but it's automated and everything is crazy/volatile right now so I'm frustrated but not surprised. 
And definitely not blaming anyone else, lol.
Glad yours went through.  Hope lots of folks get to buy in the dip.

So much for the anonymity theory.
