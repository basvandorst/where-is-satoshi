You shouldn't invest in something on the hope's of a glass being half full, or empty for that matter \( shorting \). A lot more due diligence than that should be done before any sort of investment is made.

The only person in this post who didn't trade shit is you man. If you're actually interested in equities maybe hit your friends up and stop shitposting on so much.

Well $KBSF today was even better than $DXR so I'm sorry to hear your friends didn't get in on that. Personally I check out of trading about an hour or 2 in because volumes usually dries up so I missed out on $KBSF.  
  
It's not like $DXR is that amazing either, I've seen 500% + runs in a single day before ($DRYS / $MGT / $SUNE , etc ). So I don't know why you don't just realize this is how equities are. There's a reason prop firms and institutional trading is a thing.

This. I've been out for awhile too, it's just trending down, I'm not about to short BTC but I won't be bullish on it either. So I took my profits off the table and am back to equity trading for now.

I know you are memeing but...You can though... That's actually where that meme came from lol, from equity trading over at WSB.

1) Runescape? I've never posted anything about Runescape so you're literally tripping.  
2) It doesn't matter what you think about me, $KBSF and $DXR ran today well over 100% and there is regularly equities making volatile moves each day. It's better to trade equities than BTC and that is a fact wether you believe I trade or not, so your opinion really means nothing.

That's part of why TA actually works though, because of all the trader's ( with significant positions ) following it. That's literally one of the most basic rules of TA that you can learn it's called VOLUME. TA only really works well in a high volume equity. It's inaccurate when volume is low.

Not sure how you got that math, I took a 25% loss when I sold and if BTC got to $10,000 I'd gain 42.8% from my new cost basis. My Break Even Point is about 8,800 from my new CB, not 10,000.

**I don't want to do this all the time**. Obviously I just want the coins to go up from here.

*Invests in BTC and down 20% the next day* lul.

Those aren't the real TA guys dude, those are the fake bullshit artists. Real trader's and technical analysts don't talk publicly about this stuff. They either work alone or in small groups, or larger groups like prop firms. They don't go posting all over social media lul.
