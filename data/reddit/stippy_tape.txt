Circle? I switched to them when Coinjar had to put the 10% GST on and haven't looked back. They process payments immediately.

I totally agree. Why would someone do this though?
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:09:23
I agree, I always had that feeling too. I put up with it though for convenience (and the lack of alternatives). Now the GST and Circle have become a deadly combination for Coinjar it seems.

This is very disappointing. I have been a happy customer of theirs for months.
Obviously this means I wont be buying from them after October 3rd... Especially since I can now buy from Circle.
It appears as though they haven't put up much of a fight. I thought they might. 
I was pleased for example when they found a way around being shut off from NAB deposits, in fact I think they were excluded from all the big 4.
I thought that showed some fighting spirit. 
This blog post doesn't show any at all.
They say they are working with the tax office - could they communicate any of this publicly as others have done over the proposed bitlicence?
Could they incorporate overseas? If this is too difficult, why is it too difficult?
Why are they bothering with the swipe card and the marketing campaigns?
Surely this is the death of their business?

I would look to developing countries - find a project that can help people get access to banking services for example - or clean water, or vaccinations.
There is a lot of need out there waiting for something just like bitcoin to come along.
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:42:25
The website doesn't mention bitcoin. Or did I miss it?
@_date: 2014-12-02 05:31:22
What about bitaddress.org? Is that safe?

 I have dreams..oh..the dreams.

That's not true. 
My St George Visa debit and credit Mastercard both work. 
I have had no problems at all with Circle purchases, and I have had  instant confirmations. Actually, maybe once the confirmation took a few minutes - five maybe?
I have also transferred BTC in - no problems.
Have not tried to transfer BTC out or sell - I'm not selling for anything!

Australia - St George bank. I was charged 17.5% - $10 purchase has come through as 11.75 and a $20 purchase as $23.50. I'm not sure though, maybe I bought USD10 and USD20? How can I tell?
@_date: 2014-12-17 10:43:03
No, they let you through.. But why would they ask for 2.99? Aren't micro transactions the whole point? 2.99 seems steep for a single article.

Do I have to have Showtime? I have IQ (which is the DVR thing, right?) but I don't have Showtime.

I've been using St George visa and mastercards and have had no problem. 
I did give my full address.
I would imagine fake addresses are blocked. Don't all merchants use this information to verify?
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:00:04
I am a non-American (Australian) and use Circle. It works perfectly. Having said that, I have been buying since the start and they haven't increased my limit. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 02:47:03
and a very rude reply.
@_date: 2015-05-02 23:40:39
I think they're trying to help you out. At least that's what I would be doing. Making mistakes like that makes it looks like the post was written by a kid. It diminishes the credibility of your message.
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:12:42
I've used a St George debit visa and St George credit Mastercard. Have had no problems. The credit card charges more fees (cash advance fee plus currency conversion I think) so I only use the debit card now. Still get charged a fee of course.

I have seen mentions of this all over the place but don't quite get what it means.. why are they going negative,  and what's the impact? 
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:35:12
Yes, but isn't the point that with bitcoin we don't HAVE to make use of their centralised services?
@_date: 2015-08-07 00:06:42
what does this mean? which blockchain are they going to use?
@_date: 2015-07-03 05:44:43
Are you implying that's what's happening now?
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:27:19
Yes! Why? The ad is amazing - but that part is just confusing. Surely they could have chosen a less distracting/detracting example.
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:57:25
100% this. It is difficult to follow this format. Why are there questions without answers but lower down the page, the same questions are quoted and THEN answered? 
@_date: 2015-03-26 02:44:10
That sounds interesting...
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:02:13
Yes. That's the point. There is enough stored energy in us.
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:03:16
It's a metaphore 
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:42:53
I have been using coinjar for the last few weeks and although their BTC rates are high, I've had smooth transactions.
