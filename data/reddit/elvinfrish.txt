Lucky for you. I bought mine at $700.

You gotta pay to play!

Thank god. I was getting worried there for a second.

Well I only bought one coin when it was just under 700 so now I can cash out and make a couple bucks on top so I can quit stressing over the bitcoin market every week.

Now if only it would go back to 750 so I could cash out this damn bitcoin I bought back in the day when I thought it was going up to like 2500

Thanks for the replies guys, I'm going to transfer my BTC to Bread Wallet today for sure. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:36:11
ok good point. i'm sure it will be secure enough in a fire proof safe then. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:40:51
ok cool thanks

I have a physical gun safe I can keep it in. Would it be a bad idea to keep the 12 words in my password app that I keep all my computer passwords in?

So is it better to use the bread wallet app on iPhone instead of the coinbase or blockchain app? All three apps are labeled as "Bitcoin wallet" on the App Store. 
I bought a small amount of BTC about 2 years ago and have never transferred it out of Coinbase. I'd like to keep my BTC safe during this bubble but I'm not sure what app would be best to use.

so where are the lucky bastards that bought into Bitcoin with a thousand bucks or so back when each coin only cost a few cents?
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:34:26
haha well keep at it and i'm sure you'll make more. 
definitely don't loan any money to friends. If they're good friends, they'll understand. If they get pissed at you, then you don't need em around anyways. 
If you were making millions it'd be one thing to hold out on them. but i'm sure you made a couple grand or so and that's enough for you, not you're entire family and circle of friends
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:25:53
So how much did you make in the bitcoin game?
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:26:34
ain't that the fucking truth
