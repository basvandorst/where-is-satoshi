That was 2 weeks ago they made that payment. They acquired enertech from microtel-enertech which makes durable electronic devices for adverse environments, I'm pretty sure some of that technology and know how bled into the making of the anteater.

Very simply put, bitmain has been rumored to have the same financial clout as alibaba. DPW holdings is in its infancy and heavily debt ridden, they have been backing that debt and the interest payments with bitcoin. Dpw cannot weather a storm like bitmain can. This miner runs cooler than any before and would be perfect for african ckimates and power shortages, using Samsung nanochips 17.4tb/s hash rate

At 60 cents a share I'm buying dpw stock. I read where dpw paid a 500k debt payment using bitcoin to secure yhe transaction so you know the anteaters are working as we speak

I still don't think normal fibinaci rules are gonna apply when bitmain and avalon are trying cut their new american competition off ar the knees by depressing the price. DPW stock will either be the next microsoft or.the next sears depending on how long bitmain and.avalon can keep BTC price down.

Thats the plan, as well as selling to the public the anteater miners. Could work if the market holds. Bitmain and avalon should be worried. Cloud mining could be the future

DPW HOLDINGS OWNS COOLYSIS THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE 17,.2tb/s Anteater cryptominer. Read about it at superminer.com

The very main reason for the price slump is the introduction of the. New anteater miner by coolysis, bitmain is dumpling bitcoin into the market to crush them before they hit the market in 4 weeks.. The anteater smokes the ant miner 9 in all ways of efficiency, speed and reliability and they are based in california.

I think it's because bitmain is dumping bitcoin into the market to artificially suppress the price to try to take down DPW, the company that will be releasing the Anteater in 4 weeks. They are financially weak and may not be able to withstand a long price drop. The thing has a hash rate off 17.4Tb/s and runs cooler than anything ever made. It's also indestructible for African climates.made in california. Don't know how much is gonna cost.

Look, I'm just trying to say that something stinks. I've noticed some things about this stock and its movement that are not typical of a company its small size. Someone is either scared of this company or it is a complete scam. It has the reputation of a pump and dump tech. However, it's not behaving like one. DPW claims to be in production of a 17+tb/s hash rate miner shipping in 3 weeks. That's 20% faster than bitmain's antminer9, a.huge, huge player rumored to.be worth as much as alibaba. Rather than being focused on promoting its new miner, DPW seems to be focusing on the acquisition of a BTC kiosk venture, buying an accountung firm and a new  Cloud mining facility that has secured enough megawatts for 20k miners

Anyone have any inside information on the DPW coolysis anteater cryptominer?

Eventually, BTC price is going to become static with the cost of mining the remaining few. Big tech will fight it out with monster processors. What do you think the price will plateau at?
@_date: 2018-07-04 14:09:18
Do you think bitcoin will establish dominance and eventually be the only crypto after it establishes a static value and begins to.behave like a currency?
@_date: 2018-07-04 14:06:02
Is this just a guess? Or based upon a theory?
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:42:23
It's really hard to express everything that I see and all the new information I've gathered trying to educate myself to the BTC world. It doesn't make sense, but it does. I see the utility, I also see the hurled it needs to cross for permanence.. I also see the great wealth possibilities for some. I'm attempting to secure some niche that doesn't involve a ton of risk with small reward.
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:35:07
That's quite a claim. Now if you were bitmain and someone made a significantly faster miner, wouldn't you do anything to protect your position if that type of value were at stake?
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:39:53
Lol, it's rather obvious
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:38:24
Worth fighting for top position of fastest miner for sure. If DPW anteater is real, theiir company is in.jeopardy from larger interests.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:27:10
This may sound ignorant, but listen. There are a little over 2 million BTC remaining to be mined at an ever increasing difficulty. Mining costs may begin to dictate a static value, which would be a good thing. BTC lacks fungibility. Advanced miners may be the new arena of the fight to grab the reamining untapped wealth which could exceed 100k BTC before its done. DPW is in a precarious position trying to bring the USA into this fight. After announcing its next generation miner crypto tanked and the stock began to receive an onslaught of shorts, trolls and rumors. This leads me to believe that BTC price is still in its infancy if you can believe that. Tech stocks blow up on the rumor of the CEO having a good morning bowel movement. This onslaught of shorts is costing someone big. DPW still looks good to break out tomorrow. I bought in but the odds are on the monopoly I fear.
