"BTM" is kind of a weird name for it ^((I totally get why ATM, bitcoin, BTM)^) because some people will here this, and think "business technology management"
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:07:06
or is that against the rules?
@_date: 2014-07-11 01:13:37
thanks a bunch!
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:50:50

@_date: 2014-09-26 02:32:07
someone on posted this link and i thought it was an alt account
@_date: 2014-08-17 04:05:54
idk sorry.... do you have RES?
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:37:51
i hate to say this but i dont really mine now for i dont have the hardware (i have a mba) but i think [this]( may be good (i dont really know but it seems legit and super easy)
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:04:24
lol i meant NOT transferring to fiat 
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:57:41
but still if someone entered the first/third/whatever key and put btc in it, doesnt that mean anyone can take them? (this may sound stupid but thats illegal right?)
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:22:49
but when the price goes up it can be worth $100
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:28:47
this wasn't a repost - send me a link to where someone else posted this BEFORE i posted it - i'll remove this once you send it
it didn't say "link already submitted"
@_date: 2014-07-11 01:24:46
do people do it as much as they tip dogecoins on @_date: 2014-07-11 01:02:37
@_date: 2014-12-24 21:46:41
I just went to buy a $10 Amazon card, and Bitcoin also gives you the most points back! (you can buy gift cards with your points)
@_date: 2014-09-26 02:31:32
HOLY shit im sorry didnt mean to post that here
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:39:31
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:53:16
but even tho the first key had transactions, does that mean someone could enter the private key and give themselves btc?
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:16:18
Plz tip me and I will be forever greatful ;)
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:50:25
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:33:57
Am I late by a few days? lol plez? i wanna get into btc
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:03:33
i scanned the qr on my phone... says "2.279 btc"
@_date: 2014-10-10 00:28:19
interesting concept.....
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:21:29
this one hasn't been posted yet ;)
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:07:04
ok....sorry..... i'll delete it
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:37:07
well, it hasn't
@_date: 2014-10-10 03:30:53
so this isn't a stupid question? ok
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:27:51
yeah i've taken an old asus and hackintoshed it.... it didnt really workout given the fact the wifi card didn't work and i would have to buy a new one.  I already have a MBA (and it's way better than a hacintosh) so i just installed ubuntu on it.  The hole "Hackintosh" thing is interesting though
@_date: 2014-10-19 02:52:33
"You can usually build an equivalent system yourself for much cheaper" - kind of like Macs!
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:05:21
lol i thought bitwallet was a little reliable at least....
@_date: 2014-07-10 04:10:47
a pool, but it took to long so im not doing it anymore... i just checked it every once in a while...
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:32:19
dude..... tipping doge insnt allowed here....
@_date: 2014-10-10 03:22:27
you don't know i'm a human.......we are on the internet......lol is it really that far away?
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:34:10
Sure thing, I'll make it when I get home
@_date: 2014-10-16 12:44:28
@_date: 2014-10-21 00:44:11
its embarrassing....lol
@_date: 2014-08-17 04:06:06
its working for me
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:30:42
I'll be sure to post about it (should take about half a year at what I'm mining at lol)
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:01:46
the first one has btc
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:16:12
Haha I only have a fraction - i'm just wondering if it is worth keeping them
@_date: 2014-10-19 02:51:37
A little strange, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:37:23
this is crazy that people are buying properties in btc
edit: dont get me wrong i love the idea!
@_date: 2014-10-06 21:44:09
This is awesome!  If only I could read Swedish... Anyone have a translate?
@_date: 2014-07-10 02:06:11
@_date: 2014-07-11 01:13:22
lol thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:17:24
ok... sorry
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:40:23
maybe bing just doesnt want to translate it? it could maybe work in every english speaking country...even the US has no national language...
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:16:37
why not?
@_date: 2014-10-16 23:39:55
I mine alts and get paid it btc
@_date: 2014-10-14 14:04:45
only like $5 or so, and that includes any changes you need/want, etc
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:48:18
lmao rip38
@_date: 2014-10-10 01:08:47
haha yes i remember that
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:00:27
imma check the balance of the first one (im NOT going to use it)
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:59:59
wait so we can enter any of these keys and use it? even if they have btc?
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:06:46
there is a reason we use google chrome for web browsing....
@_date: 2014-10-19 11:35:13
oooo good point. i didn't think of it this way. thats a really good point. upvoted
@_date: 2014-07-10 02:05:50
@_date: 2014-07-11 01:18:27
no way.... is that also somewhat saying altcoin prices will go up as well?
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:32:46
sorry.....RES worked for me, i refreshed the page and everything and it still worked
@_date: 2014-08-17 03:49:30
ik lmao
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:05:44
pm me ur btc address i can try to send some to you
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:05:32
oh ok thx i understand it now
@_date: 2014-10-14 11:38:20
Price depends on difficulty (usually not a lot anyway)
You tell me the company/what you want the logos to be (colors etc)
@_date: 2014-10-19 11:25:55
It's not that it's necessary but it would be nice since I already have digekeepee- I would like my bitcoin wallet in the same place
@_date: 2014-10-19 04:35:08
does it use block.io?
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:22:57
lol ill try hard not to XD
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:32:13
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:30:03
i just searched the sub and didn't find anything so go away
@_date: 2014-10-19 04:19:00
the app already exists?
@_date: 2014-10-14 14:08:56
Yeah so I'm starting and want some actual work, so just comment here
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:21:02
Ok, so that just says they are making accounts - forbid the lord that means they are trying to get themselves ranked, but If I bought it, was I scammed?
@_date: 2014-11-21 00:05:19
i wasnt attempting to troll, i just wanted to know if there was a way to buy stock without converting to USD and just buying it with bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:22:24
Alright, thanks so much!
@_date: 2014-10-15 01:59:51
its nothing ik but is it a scam?
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:06:05
You can build computers with the same specs as a Mac can't you? they might not be perfectly laid out....
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:43:07
ahhh thanks so much! (i figured someone would tell me)
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:11:48
ok so i got a script error - what is a reliable app?
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:31:17
no it hasn't!
@_date: 2014-07-11 01:17:03
@_date: 2014-10-19 04:51:57
Thats what I mean - we need an app that uses block.io
@_date: 2014-07-08 17:22:41
i scanned the private key's qr code
@_date: 2014-10-19 02:52:46
Kind of like Macs!
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:23:44
thats exactly what i wanted, thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:35:31
well NOW i use multibit
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:28:01
Will do! Thanks for the advice! 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:46:12
Haha ok
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:46:33
Mega Hash my bad
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:42:08
i swear i've been [here]( over 100 times and i always get google
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:49:44
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:24:05
Do you feel a spending problem coming up due to the fact it's almost easier than using a credit card?
Also, good luck!
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:22:59
i havent but now ill be sure to stay away from it ;)
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:18:06
I'm not looking for anyone to buy them, I'm just wondering if the price will go up - its a yes or no question
@_date: 2014-07-10 17:43:57
too much ;)
@_date: 2014-10-10 01:09:38
well, we have time to build that up, now don't we ;)
@_date: 2014-08-17 03:59:47
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-05-26 23:02:23


-__- I understand what credit cards are.  I was curious to see if they spend more money because it's bitcoin and it's easier to pay like that, versus (and I already feel the downvotes from me saying this next thing), paying CC and signing a check. It sounds crazy it does, but I feel people will spend more not needing to do the extra step, with verifying their ID and everything. I'm fully aware of how


works.  I have a bitcoin account ;)  I just don't have 70k in bitcoin.
I was curious on that matter.  Thank you anyway!
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:16:46
10 bits I've received them before, so lets try this...
Now how little amount of bits can you send?
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:06:35
Good point.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:22:02
this has a link w/ more information
@_date: 2015-05-27 01:48:47


a &gt; and then text after it
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:54:22
But honestly, isn't there a chance this is a scam?
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:03:44
As in a thing where you spend too much too fast, you know, what some people do with gambling? They keep putting more and more in.
ninja edit: only because it's super easy to spend vs a cc
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:02:54
awesome i'll do that - thank you!
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:48:24
What are the chances it's a scam?
@_date: 2014-08-13 04:06:59
@_date: 2015-05-27 01:21:33


simplicity.  people, NEWS REPORTERS, are by accident already buying things with the iWatch.  i just think people will be like "hey, if I just scan a QR code and pay, its easy and fast!" and I think people might get carried away, with it being this new, big thing.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:14:13
I REALLY like the simple design! Signing up was super easy!
When I made the password to start out with, I didn't use a symbol. What was nice was I went to another page which told me why, and it was SUPER easy, which is a huge part of websites today!
Just one thing, instead of having your address next to my name, I would like it to be in the middle of the Send/Recieve/Request/etc. navigation bar.
Maybe it's just me, but other then that, dude you are golden!

@_date: 2015-11-12 11:44:57
I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:07:14
hmmm....do we try it?
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:38:03
See now I saw this little bit ago.... is it actually legit?
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:36:41

@_date: 2015-03-09 17:52:44
I have a Mac....darn!
Wait I have Windows 10 in boot camp!  Even better! A newer OS!  (the fact that it's not released yet doesn't matter....newer is better!)
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:06:15
Ohh. I like that :P
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:51:28
Why don't we drag and drop it into Command Promp as administrator as well?
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:25:13
Oh yes, random executable files off the internet are always safe!  They aren't phishy or anything!  I'll tell you how it goes!
