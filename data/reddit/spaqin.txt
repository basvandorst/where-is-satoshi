But he's not saying that these problems can't be overcome, at the end he says exactly:


Saying that it's perfect now, and forgetting its cons is stupid.

Won't be a success unless they give up the silly ActiveX/million "security" programs/physical certs to access your bank account.

There are four main mobile operators in Poland, and they all have similar numbers. No wonders, because if you are loyal to any of them, they treat you like shit, but new customers are given much better terms.

Oh, looks like something I did for a university project, except I made an Android app which was more universal - any messages or files. The idea's really cool, but the problem is that the images must be stored in a lossless format, like PNG, which significantly increases their size (useful information cannot be compressed efficiently), and with that, can be sent only by mail which won't recompress them into a JPEG. Obviously, if you find a strangely big picture in PNG format on someone's device, there's high probability that it has something hidden inside. Encryption will keep it more safe, but still, everyone will know you're hiding something there.
Something better would be steganography working with how JPEG files are made (like jstego doest that), but it would be harder to do and would let you keep less info. I considered that option for my app, but since it was silly uni project and I was rather lazy, I didn't do it :e
