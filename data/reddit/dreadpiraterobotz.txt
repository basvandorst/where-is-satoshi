No, you cannot withdraw crypto from robinhood, only buy and sell. Use cashapp for easy way to buy &amp; withdraw to your own wallet ��

Coinbase does same thing it's nothing new

thats how all bitcoin atms work.. u have to look at the bitcoin price displayed.. its not a ripoff exactly
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:13:47
Yes. Cashapp easy n way better than coinbase.. u will have to verify identity before u send to other wallet but only takes 48 hours max
@_date: 2019-01-10 01:22:34
Have u used it? Look up address on the blockchain n check balance
@_date: 2019-01-10 01:24:35
Well there are presumably hundreds of different companies/types of Bitcoin atms.. im sure they do not all work the same.. from my experience it would be a new address everytime
