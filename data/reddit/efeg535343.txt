or bitcoin-24.com - they're actually incorporated in the UK but have a polish bank account for cheap SEPA transfers via transferwise.com;  - for SEPA it's a fixed fee of eur1.24 and transferwise is less than 1% for the gbp/eur conversion plus their fee of £1. Also the market is denominated in EUR so no need for a further useless fx back to USD like at bitstamp (even though it's pretty cheap) and no trading fee.

for £10 it's probably cheaper to use  -- they support direct domestic GBP bank transfers.

ahh. well honestly from the UK I wouldn't use mtgox, I'd use one of the euro exchanges - possibly bitcoin-24.com since they're a british company (even though they transact through a polish bank acct).

How would a distributed exchange set the price? or rather, what would stop people from fibbing about the price a trade happened at or indeed whether or not a trade had even occurred? People rely on information about other people's trades to decide where to put their bid and ask.. without a central exchange there is no reliable way to collect this information.
To see what I mean, imagine localbitcoins - which aside from it's website is fairly distributed. Now imagine that mtgox didn't exist. How would localbitcoin users know what price to transact at? The localbitcoins site could publish trade information since it is infact centralized, but there's nothing stopping users from making fake accounts and making fake trades between them to render that information useless. Also, without a central escrow not everyone's coins are worth as much since their trust levels are not the same. I don't see how this could ever work as a replacement for a centralized exchange.. it might work ok along side one, but it actually relies on the central exchange for price discovery.

eh. i think that's pretty wrong.. you certainly can't ping cloudflare's IP and get back the closest node - and they absolutely do use the anycast IPs as the source of packets.. of course they're also not using IPv6 but I doubt if they were they would comply with these RFCs.
It might be possible for attackers to find the original IP the site was on before they started fronting with cloudflare and then DDOS that - sidestepping cloudflare entirely, but you could always move the site to another IP and never tell anyone but cloudflare what it is.
