They were being audited by a respected auditor but halted it once they, you know, started actually looking into stuff. Their press release on the subject was pretty amusing:


What a load of utter bollocks.

Presumably they can only print so much Tether before it starts impacting the price of Tether itself (price has been less than $1 since Saturday) so to answer your question "why has the price been dropping", well they can't get away with printing enough to stop it dropping.

The writing has been on the wall for weeks now. Tether has been injecting a lot of "money" into this space and when it becomes apparent to everyone that the money isn't real, sums far greater than MtGox, then things are going to take quite a tumble.
I get the impression that the suspicious behaviour of Tether/Bitfinex is news to you? From an outsider's perspective, I don't have any money invested in crypto currency but find it rather interesting/weird, I would say this subreddit is an echo chamber and recommend you find additional places to keep up to date with this scene.

My understanding is that Tether alleges to have 1 USD for each USDT in circulation so if the price fell below 1 USD they could take 1 USD from their pile, use it to take 1 USDT out of circulation and pocket the remaining USD. They \*know\* it's worth 1 USD because they're in possession of the proof so it's easy money for them if the price falls, right? Well maybe not. They're under no legal obligation to exchange 1 USD for 1 USDT and there's absolutely nothing in the way of proof that they have a financial reserve to back each USDT in circulation.

I believe they might have honoured requests to exchange in the beginning and their obligation to buyback was setout from the start but it's still a house of cards.

Um, you were saying?

They aren't random bits of data though. They're bits of data that someone specifically crafted to encode an image and can use a tool to get the raw image back. I'm not saying possession of the blockchain is possession of CP because some idiot decided to encode some data that would be illegal to possess in its decoded form and added it the blockchain. However using phrases such as "random bits" is as ridiculous as the comparison to extracting information from the pi constant.
I think any court that adopts common sense wouldn't convict for it but whether it would meet the definition of possession under strict liability is an interesting question.

What an utterly baseless statement. Pull that one from your arse?

Unfortunately that's incredibly difficult. If someone is tearing off your fingernails because they want access to your coins then, for the vast majority of people, your only protection is difficulty in accessing the funds. Best case scenario is a hardware wallet stored inside a bank safe. Bank staff might get a bit suspicious seeing someone with two black eyes being escorted to their safety deposit box by two large gentlemen. However that awkward situation is avoided with threats of violence against family members instead. Not the mention this kind of protection being impractical for the majority of people holding coins. A password-protected offline wallet or hardware wallet that is easily accessible is as good as it gets and that isn't protection against someone willing to beat you over the head for a couple grand. The inability to undo transactions obviously has its advantages but it's also very attractive to criminals.

That is true. However that might be something outside of your control. If an exchange you've used becomes compromised then your details could leak out.

Greed no doubt.

- Adoption
- Convenience
- Ease of use
- Fraud protection
Pretty compelling reasons for using a credit card over bitcoin in my eyes.

Or perhaps people aren’t comfortable using a currency that has massive swings in value, inconvenient to actually use for anything other than being a vehicle for speculative investing and massively put off by the rampant scamming within the cryptocurrency scene.

There's no obvious justification for this sudden momentum. If I were you I'd be quick to sell if it starts dropping by a couple hundred.
