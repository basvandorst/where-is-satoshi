Bascially they're all pulling these numbers out of their asses. There's no way of knowing what the market will do. These are just (un)educated guesses at best. You don't see any of them going all in. If they're so sure that this kind of grow is certain, wouldn't that be the case? People need to stop posting this sort of stuff..giving the flock hope when you nor anyone else has the faintest clue what will happen is just bs. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:50:38
Hence why the regulations being discussed aren't as bad of a thing you think it to be. With it comes somewhat balance and stability and real investors will feel a lot safer investing in it and with it all, the coin will grow and stabilize. Then, you might get the cup of coffee you want so much for a reasonable and stable price instead of paying "10 cents" today only to find out you could've as well bought a house with the same amount 4 weeks later, for example.

Taking the piss is also a legitimate, quantifiable psychological effect. They're just throwing numbers into the wild. And I too get that the more people see this thebkore likely they will invest and the more likely the prices will rise, but nonetheless, this is still pulling numbers out your ass. Just looking at the list proces this very fact. Everyone has different predictions. The underlying fact remains that no one, not you nor I nor any of these fine people on this list have the faintest clue what will happen. And to say they do is just a load of horseshit.

News flash; cryptocurrency in general get a ton of bad rep and have had so since the start and most definitely after the climb craze last year. By your statment we should have nothing but dips then... And "prove you wrong"? I'm sorry buddy, I've been doing nothing else for the past hour. Now, if you don't mind, I have more entertaining things to attend to. Have a good night/day

What's with all these panic posts about the dip? After the 19k drop we had a dip in February and recovered. We had a dip in April and recovered. Why is everyone so dramatic about this one? Mind you, we haven't dipped as low as the two mentioned ones above (yet). So why all the panic posts? Calm your tits. I'm not saying I KNOW the market will recover, but we have seen this in the past.. so calm down, maybe? Wait and see what happens.. that's all any of us can do. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:38:49

@_date: 2018-05-27 11:46:58
There are 600 + altcoins out there that have very little to no value at all. There's really no point in investing in anything below the top 50 and even then it really only remains a gamble. BTC is the biggest and baddest and no one has the faintest clue of what will happen with the market. 
So if the biggest and baddest has an "uncertain" future.. there's even less "hope" for the rest.  
As for any investment possibly turning into profit in x years.. again, no one knows or can tell you with absolute certainty that "y" coin will be "x" worth in "z" time. 
So take any and all advise or (un)educated guess with a grain of salt.

Please point out the "news" where they specifically state that this regulation is due to its decline.

Exactly. Also wouldn't the manipulation have happened, if at all, during it's rise instead of it's decline? That would be much more realistic if manipulation was indeed the case.

I have and this is nothibg more than a speculation by the author with "sources" pointing towards an article from the very same site with more speculation. There are 0 statements there as to why exactly the investigation and regulation will be taking place. People just assume its due to the decline in price when really they should be looking as to why it went up as high and as fast as it did in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:56:47
I'm tired of these statements. 
No one knows what will happen and if they claim they do they're full of sh*t. 
All anyone can do is, at best, give an educated guess. And even so, it'll still remain nothing more than a guess. And no one should blindly follow it like law.
BTC reaching 100k... Hell..Why not make it 500k? If we're pulling numbers out of our asses anyway.. might as well go with a bang. 8M by June 2019! Time to get a second mortgage on the house, sell all assets. Sell your grandma and buy all the BTC you can!! Trust me I can see the future. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:07:08
First off, this is becoming a tad childish. Second of all, you're derailing from the initial point of discussion in which you stated that the decline is due to manipulation. I have yet to see any legitimate sources to your claims. Clearly, you must have a glass ball on your table which grantss you access to information the rest of us don't have. I mearly pointed out that if manipulation was indeed a thing to begin with, it would have made a lot more sense for it to have taken place during the price climb instead of its decline. You're taking this to a "my dad can beat up your dad" scenario with your beloved Bitcoin cash. Which wasn't the point of this to begin with, I might add.
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:12:41
Honestly mate, can we give the whole "manipulation" bs a rest? If manipulation was indeed a factor, it would have made much more sense if it took place during btc's climb instead of its decline. If anything, its correction at it's finest.

@_date: 2018-05-28 20:23:35
Thing is we had a lower dip in February. We had people like yourself claiming all sorts of stuff then too. Then, we had a lower dip in April too, and again more like you showed up stating that was the end of bitcoin. Isn't the record getting a little old by now? Isn't it time to play a different card? I'm not saying I KNOW the market will recover, but unlike you I'm not saying it will die out either. Truth is, no one knows what will happen and at the end of the day all we have are (un)educated guesses to go with. But to be stating things as if they are facts is a bit of a dodgy road to take, isn't it?

Be glad it was $30 and not $300 or $3000. I honestly can't believe people still fall for the get rich quick scams out there. There's no way in hell you can double or triple your investment as easy as these cunts make it sound and there's always a (huge) risk involved in ANY investment. Take the loss and be glad it was only a small amount. Hopefully, you now know better.
@_date: 2018-06-30 21:48:36
But electricity, the refrigerator and the mobile phone were all insanely expensive in their early years of adaption. Hence why it took so long for it to be "mainstream". If smartphones were as cheap as say, bitcoin, when they first came out the adaption curve would have been months instead of years. Also, we can't really compare word-to-mouth back then with the easy and fast way we consume information nowadays. If we take these things into consideration then it should take way less time now for anything huge to become "normal/mainstream".

There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the site itself. Just the 3rd party they have handling their crypto payments seem a bit dodgy from the reviews I could find. 
But it's a common thing to have a 3rd party handle your payments though, they just have to be a bit cautious of whom they choose to have it handle it for them.

Again, the amount of usage (using it as fiat replacement) as opposed to the actual amount of hodling is incomparable. To assume this is the reason it grew in both popularity and in price is honestly baffling. Both the tech and it's exclusivity had a huge part in that. The fact its being minimally(compared to the amount of hodling) used around the globe is a welcomed treat at best at this point. It has little(for now) affect as of yet. This does open doors to a wider usage group and it is and will always remain a very good advertisement for btc, but it is not(by far) the reason for its price surge.

@_date: 2018-07-30 10:08:30
Ah yes, because the few transactions that took place as opposed to the massive amount of hodling really spiked up the price.. the technology in general or exclusivity in terms of it being finite had nothing to do with it. It was the average Joe buying useless and cheap shit with BTC that made sure the price soared.
@_date: 2018-07-02 20:54:24
Yeah but is it a good idea though? As long as there isn't a form of stability to the coin then I feel most people just want to hodl. Imagine buying groceries with bitcoin while a month later you could maybe buy a car with the same amount spent(or vice versa). As long as there is such a huge shift in prices, I don't think the majority wants to pay or be paid in btc yet. Ofc I could be wrong.
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:47:49
Predictions.. predictions.. I find that word a little heavy for what these are tbh. How about rottenguesses instead? Cause quite frankly that's all any of these are. 
No one knows what will happen and to claim they do is just an outright lie. 
For all we know it could go down to 0 tomorrow, or shoot up to 100k.
Any and everything out there are just (educated) guesses at best. All these 'experts' pulling figures out their asses don't actually mean anything. 
There are reasons to support it going either way and even then, we have no clue what or how the market will do/go. 
That being said, it's honestly a treat seeing how this sub shifts with the prices. Down: "it's over" "I've been out for x months, you should get out too". Up: "lambos incoming" "to the mooon". All these "predictions" do, is feed the gullible.

If you have access to the wallet, make a Coinbase account for instance, transfer the BTC to Coinbase(depending on the amount of btc, i suggest you do it gradually over a period of time just so they have no reason to block your account due to "suspecious activities") once your KYC stuff gets accepted and start selling bit by bit, i would advise not to just yet, since the upcoming ETF ruling might soar the price if it's approved, but if you're set on selling, that would be one of the easier ways to do it.
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:17:56

Assuming that the 21million would never move in terms of ownership, yes, you have a problem. But if(and I for one don't think it will happen, or at least not any time soon) bitcoin replaces current fiat those 21 million will rotate from owner to owner just like current fiat does. You'll be paid in btc you'll buy in btc so it is very likely you will accumulate btc just as you'd do with fiat. Plus btc would not be the only form of cryptocurrency in such a case so you'd probably be able to pay in eth or whatever else there is.
