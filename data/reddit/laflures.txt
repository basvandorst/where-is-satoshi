Regardless if I made money mining (spoiler alert: I didn't), the fact that I could [zip tie ASIC miners to a fan and mine internet gold]( was too silly of a bet not to take.

My lil 3ghz miner has gone from generating $1.80 to almost $20 in a week.  The amount of btc mined hasnt really jumped considering difficulty etc. While not a ton of cash, the % increase has been surprising to say the least.  i just wonder if the math is scaleable to like an 85ghz miner.....

Checking account owners of Reddit, how many dollars do you own, and what do you do with it?

After more than a week of not hearing from them I have to call my CC company to issue a chargeback.  Has anyone received any items from bitcoinrigs.com ?

while incredibly informative, the layout of the graphic could use some help.

You think 1 employee in a well funded company is running the largest US marketplace for BTC?

Very much this.  I see BTC as a tool for freedom from the oligarchs.  We no longer need them and their system.  
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:15:02
No problems on my end.

I think I may have misread your comment...and I did.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:08:27
exactly this.  
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:07:46
not disagreeing, just could use some help is all.

Why do these threads keep cropping up?  Do you ask people about their checking accounts, 401k or IRA?
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:41:20
I think this is part of the problem.  They just got a rather large round of funding.  Not hiring is the same as not fixing a problem they admittedly know they have....
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:42:00
samesies.

Seems like there is a typo on your product pages "Once size fits most"
Also are these all dead stock?

No, I got that part.  His title says BTCC and CB are "run" by the same "family".  Charles is part of the CB team, sure, but running the show? doubt it, Brian Anderson would probably have something to say about that.
