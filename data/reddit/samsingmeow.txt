Explain more

They need to educate themselves and do things in $1000 chunks. $10 fee is 1% which is still way too high but better than doing low value transfers.

Stop guessing and sniping. Rub one out.

It's important to trade the coins and tokens, not just hold them.

How is this only at 8% after 2 years?

They'll accept it once the NSA figures out an exploit.

Then why are miners still in business while Blockstream has a burn rate of $3.4 million a month.

Quoting u/armchaircryptologist in part--
when I say "economic" nodes I'm talking the nodes run by Bitpay, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitfinex and so on that are central for the economic activity in the ecosystem. These are the nodes you need to have running the USAF if you want to force the miner's hands with a mining minority.
Though it is certainly true that if the USAF does cause a fork, and the hashpower for the segwit fork is only slightly below that of the legacy fork, it would not take much for the segwit fork to overtake the legacy fork and become the majority chain. This could happen any number of times over the 1915 to 3931 blocks it would take to lock-in Segwit, but it would take fairly significant miner support to have any chance of getting there in the first place. (Of course, if the segwit fork has higher hashpower than the legacy fork, the legacy fork will be short-lived if it even forms at all.)

Now we're investing our life savings and buying on margin! ��
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:05:06
Because confirmations take about 6 hours these days?

Finally a use case where the long confirmation times won't really matter!

AML will apply. So this doesn't help all the Bitcoin bought to avert capital outflows  and currency controls. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:54:58
Also the non fucking girl scouts. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:29:31
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:59:58
Or just Core

Unless they buy Bitcoin with their fiat and Bitcoin goes up in the future. It might not.  Look at 2014 to 2016.

You're raising friction to downvote so these scam projects can just hire cheap labor to create lots of upvotes.

It's a linear improvement. We need to think exponentially. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:20:40
What could go wrong? ��
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:39:23
Brian Armstrong's blog, BitPay announcement, common knowledge, completey different economic interests. They need scale. Bitcoin Core Dev is risk averse, overly obsessed with transaction malleability and security. Safest is zero transactions. No risk!
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:44:09
Unless they file for patents under the revokable ruse of defense only! If true, put it in a smart contract with personal liability to the Inner Core devs and large punitive and liquidated damages upon violation.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:00:43
Then why hasn't it happened after 2 years? That doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:23:01
Well if they use assurance contracts then I'm sure it works! ��

Reimder that AXA is not a bank. They are the world's largest insurance company. They owns Alliance Capital $700 billion aum and are the biggest investor in Blockstream.

It's like an ICO for the community.

It's a defensive patent like Blockstream's patents.

Money laundering?
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:41:30
Which is happening thanks to the  Blockstream Core dev cartel.
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:00:06
Why are you on this subreddit?
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:13:50
Similarly, if most major changes to the Bitcoin Core code is controlled by Blockstream developers then you have centralization at the developer level too.

All of them (Coinbase, BitPay, etc.) hate Bitcoin Core. You're screwed.

Wrong. You can cancel your Kickstarter VISA  anytime or complain even after they ship your stuff to you.  You can also vomlain to Kickstarter. Here you will never see your Bitcoin again.

Cryptos are agnostic. The people who use them can do so for good or evil.
