Also, I feel that money has just been shifting around and getting recycled - when BTC is stagnant, money goes to alts &gt;&gt; get some gains in alts, flow back to BTC. Once the year-end bonuses come in on Jan 15, I think that the "fresh money" will get things going again.

@_date: 2017-12-11 14:49:58
Agree. The keyword Pharaoh106 you used is "storing".
Exchanges are where you can buy/sell, but the coin amounts you see are just credits. Only when you transfer externally will the exchange be forced to give you your portion of coin from their stockpile.
You only hold your coin(s) when you hold them in your own external wallet.
Now, if you want to buy/sell quickly - then keep them on exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:39:51
Agree. Would be nice to read!

Consolidated yesterday around $16.5K which was nice. I prefer these slower % rises. Gut is that if we can edge over that ~$17K high you mentioned (something like $17,200?) we keep going up rest of week.
I think after today, the next corrections will be to $16.5 as the new support (we are past the $13). All speculation of course and not financial advice :)

Everyone has their "moon" and surprise life circumstances. While one person might be waiting for $1M/BTC, another is ready to sell at $100K/BTC. Also, some will have life-changing events (whatever they may be) that could require them to sell their BTC.
I don't think there is such thing as everyone, hodling forever. The fact that there is a trading price is proof that there are buyers and ... sellers.

If you believe in BTC, then you should believe that inflationary currencies are not good (i.e., you like that BTC has a hard cap of 21M). These forks embody inflation - they copy-and-paste the BTC core code, tweak one parameter, and create "value". Maybe it's free money, but I wouldn't buy any of them - I would exchange them for more BTC.
It's up to your wallets to support the forks. Claiming air drop coins is not something beginners should try on their own.

It's interesting to compare the desire/interest in these cryptocurrencies depending on the stability of the country's currency and trust in government. 
Small sample set, but, for example, Wences Casares an early adopter/Bitcoin entrepreneur is from Argentina so he grew up with rampant inflation and government control on bank accounts - this drew him to Bitcoin. 
Perhaps, does Belgium have a very trusted government by it's people leading to a lower interest in these decentralized currencies (I really don't know - just an inquiry)?

Each bitcoin block is 1MB (1,000,000 bytes). 
Number of transactions per block varies but can be viewed here: 
When 21M coins are mined, the incentive for continuing to create blocks will shift to being paid in transaction fees. Note that the cap is 21M, but estimated that 3-4M coins are lost, therefore there will only be 17-18M ever bitcoins in circulation.

*not tax advice - go to your accountant/CPA
the gray area is whether the transfer from your exchange wallet (e.g., coinbase/kraken/gemini) to your local hardware or desktop wallet counts as a "sale" for tax purposes. Why? B/C once it leaves your exchange, they do not know whether you kept or sold it and could err on the side of caution to report it as as sale to the tax authorities.
i'll leave the answering of that to your CPA/accountant.

What do you mean by "get it out": (a) sell for fiat; or (b) transfer to hardware wallet for safekeeping?
If (a) sure you can sell it for cash on coinbase or GDAX
If (b) transfer to GDAX, then transfer to wallet with no additional transaction fee (i.e., transfer 0.006 BTC to wallet and receive 0.006 BTC with no loss due to txn fee)
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:51:11

An additional note/point of thought for xAlpha_101: "the code" itself is an agreement (consensus) because it is open source. To make any changes, there is discussion then agreement.
I have no doubt that as we near the 21M mark there will be heated discussion. One side will say "add back" the 3-4M that are lost so that we have 21M. Other side will say "no", nothing changes we already do have 21M just some are lost. Each side will outline why they are correct and discuss the merits.
I have no side in this yet, but believe this will be a point of contention.

4% is high for a fee (I think that's the credit card fee).
If you believe in BTC, timing should be the least important since you expect it's value to increase drastically.  Wait for your bank deposit then go all in.
Going forward have money already in your USD wallet on coinbase/GDAX so that you can buy the dips immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:39:08
Are you talking about the "depth chart" (green on left half; red on right half)?
There might be more people willing to sell at prices higher than people are willing to buy. So, the buys are only at the low-hanging fruit prices. Thus, not enough actual sales to break the "sell wall" at whatever high price and cause further dip.

GDAX has no fee to transfer from online wallet to hardware wallet (I assume they are eating this for now, or account for it in the 0.25% purchase fee).
When you deposit crypto into a wallet, you will pay the usual network transaction fee needed to include in a block. So, you will pay usual network txn fee whether it is to GDAX or any other online exchange wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:30
Not "everything" - don't forget that you can increase how much you pay for the transaction fee to get included in a block. 
Notice that the higher paying fees get included in the blocks first (miner's choice). It's the lower paying fees at the bottom of the mempool chart that get stuck in pending.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:21:45
Yes - GDAX is an exchange. You can buy BTC on GDAX, and then sell it on GDAX for USD. 
But, to withdraw into your checking account you will of course have to exchange your BTC for USD. This will incur a sell fee which is normal, just like selling Amazon stock on ScottTrade or any other platform.

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:57:16
Depends on the wallet. 
Most online exchanges do not allow you to set your transaction fee (i.e., if willing to pay more satoshis/byte, you can incentivize a miner to include your txn in a block sooner).  You just pay whatever they set behind the scenes - which, I assume, is whatever amount they believe will guarantee it to get confirmed.
Other wallets do allow you to select what you are willing to pay. For example, a mobile Bitcoin wallet called Mycelium offers several possibilities for Bitcoin transaction fees: low-priority, economic, normal priority and high priority.

They can't help it - Pensions, Endowments, SWFs, etc have to put a portion (even if just a 5% sliver) in cryptos as a hedge against missing the boat, otherwise their returns might be left in the dust - conversely if everything tanks, they only had that miniscule proportion invested.

I see it as weeding people out. The underlying principle of BTC is "don't trust anyone" - hence decentralization.  This article will do one of two things: (1) scare someone away who does no research; or (2) encourage a curious person to learn more about the protocol itself. It's tough for anyone to believe in BTC if they always rely on other people's knowledge (like this article), but easy if you do your own research. I'd rather have the "do your own research" people join and hodl.

Question remains what is the remaining 67% of OP's net worth???

Aah, okay.
Either way, good luck - I hodl BTC and have traditional retirement holdings, but don't have your guts to go all in on BTC with my traditional investments. You're a hero!

More people definitely know about it, but the chatter doesn't mean adoption - at this point (as has already been stated) it's mostly speculators. I do look forward to when BTC gains mass adoption.

Though, I worry about advertising that I hodl crypto. Do you  all keep that under wraps or share it with the world?
