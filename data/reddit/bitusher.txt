Many people really do have slow connections around the world. My Average speed is 2-2.5Mbps down and between 0.5 to 0.7 Mbps up with a 60 USD a month plan. What is worse is that this isn't just a cost issue because I literally cannot get faster internet no matter how much money I spend a month as I'm paying for the best this region has to offer. 
I'm a reasonable guy and am perfectly ok going along with increasing capacity if it kicked of a few nodes due to price or location. Increasing capacity too quickly could kick off whole regions(in my case more than half the country) and potentially whole countries however which I believe to be unacceptable.
@_date: 2016-08-24 00:45:26


Perhaps a start is not restricting half a country from verifying txs which is a very modest request? I have never lived in Africa, but from what I have seen you may also be restricting half a continent as well if you increase capacity too quickly.

Their bonuses/salary are paid in timelocked btc. Lets assume this wasn't true and they are only incentivised by the stock they own as far as Blockstream is concerned as a hypothetical. These are mostly early adopters with large savings in bitcoin. They have much more to gain from btc growing in value than their few % in stock growing in value even if you were to make the naive assumption that blockstream will be the next MSFT. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:36:22
No, I clearly and repeatedly suggested there should be a compromise where some users with poor internet (I.E. - 3g in my country) or some users with older HW (an older laptop or raspberry pi) can be kicked off their nodes. The cutoff we should be concerned about is when whole countries and extremely large regions can no longer run full nodes. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:43:26
Even if you ignore all other motivations they have and just focus on money, Bitcoins success and their timelocked bonuses paid in bitcoin present a much larger opportunity than any IPO , even if you naively assume Blockstream will become the next google/MSFT

cherry picking your facts ? Most of the other cofounders of blockstream  are indeed early adopters. Some of them are already millionaires because of bitcoin and don't even need to work for blockstream at all . They are merely doing so because it provides the environment where they can continue working of a project they deeply care about for selfish and unselfish reasons.

PBFT databases have existed for many years before "block chain" or bitcoin. You keep using these terms interchangeably when they aren't necessarily correlated.


How specifically does packaging txs in blocks reduce overhead vs simply validating them in real time? 
Where is the evidence of this? Do you understand the specific reason bitcoin validates batched txs in blocks ? Hint-- it has absolutely nothing to do with reducing overhead.

 I cannot dedicate half my bandwidth to a full node. 2.5Mbps / 3 people using it in any given moment from a larger family already really restricts what is available and that is before sharing with other housing in the future. What you are suggesting is setting aside 1.25 Mbps for a node and leaving around ~420kbps for each of three users. This is unacceptable. 
There are multiple threat models one should be concerned about if one runs an SPV client, I shouldn't have to recant these to you. Satoshi's description of SPV clients in the whitepaper isn't anything like what we have now either because we don't have working fraud proofs yet. 
If you think a mere 20-40k validating nodes is sufficient for 1-2 billion users worldwide in the future we have a radically different vision of bitcoin that is irreconcilable because it would be trivial to regulate those nodes. That represents a horrible ratio of validating nodes. We went from everyone validating to a ratio of ~1:500 and now you suggest a ~1:66,666 is fine? Wow.

Follow the link I was referring to and you see it refers to this cmd- 
certUtil -hashfile bitcoin-0.12.1-win32.zip SHA256
instead of this 
certUtil -hashfile bitcoin-0.13.0-win64-setup.exe SHA256
So if a noob was following its advice they would fail to verify the sig of 0.13 . I was basically giving a tutorial for technically illiterate people that is common sense for people like you. One should not edit the file name of the downloaded file but the file name within the example linked tutorial to match what they downloaded.

You are still leaving off multiple BTC early adopters. Here they are  - Matt Corallo, Mark Friedenbach, Jorge Timon, Gregory Maxwell, Gregory Sanders, Ben Gorlick, Andrew Poelstra, Patrick Strateman, Glenn Willen, and Pieter Wuille. (10 early adopters)
Thus more than half of the Blockstream Team are definitely early adopters. Additionally, there are other team members not listed here who also may secretly be early adopters because they worked on many digital currency projects  before bitcoin and were closely communicating with bitcoin devs during those early days. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 10:46:29
Indeed, but there are indeed other tradeoffs so I should clarify that my contention isn't just validating my own txs. For example , I could rent a VPS and validate my own txs on my SPV client which was configured to only use my full node on a VPS. The problem with this, outside of the extra complexity and costs, is it centralizes nodes within a narrow range of datacenters instead of a broader range of DHCP issued ips on a wider set of class C subnets.

Why are you making the assumption that I have the liberty to use most of my bandwidth for a full node? There are multiple users in this house and we use the internet for much more than just running  a full node. 
Whats worse is there is no way for me to increase this bandwidth or even buy a second plan, even on my other houses nearby, in fact I will be forced to share this plan with those houses in the future. The only other option is 3g wifi hotspots at 200-350 kbps which isn't acceptable for 1 person surfing the net. 
I'm not some isolated or extreme case either, as around half this country has the same problem I do! Do you want to force half a country off of their nodes? I'm all for increasing capacity, but have you actually studied the bandwidth in regions across the world and realized how many regions will be forced off of their full nodes and it isn't just a matter of money either?
Tip -- you cannot simply take the averages of all speed tests in a country into consideration because there are often wide discrepancies between the speeds you find in the largest cities and surrounding neighborhoods and regions. Additionally, there are many more complex nuances to consider like soft/hard cap bandwidth limits and the fact that many of the speedtests aren't realistic because they measure burst speeds and not sustained bandwidth speeds.

Costa Rica, but there are many countries that have the same issue from my travels. Whenever you cannot run fiber optic and have to provide internet with cell towers or wimax it is really bad/oversold . But even the closest city 15 minutes away (i live in a residential community) to me that has fiber optics for both cable modem or DSL service isn't much better averaging around 2.5-7Mbps in the city, I live in a residential area , but there are definitely people worse off than me who only can get 200-350 kbps. Thus we are already in a situation where some users , regardless of money cannot run a full node. Which is fine , we have to make certain tradeoffs. Are you suggesting that it would be fine preventing large sections of countries and even large sections of continents from being able to validate their own transactions?

Me??? We are discussing half a country here within this country alone and there are many other countries that have similar problems in large regions.


Seriously? It is bad enough that most users cannot affordably mine anymore and now you think it is irrational for me to want to run a full node?
I am a perfectly reasonable person and am not an absolutist who believes in never increasing capacity and never performing a HF. It is perfectly fine that a few peoples nodes get booted because their hardware isn't up to task or they live in a area with extremely bad internet. There are many houses here that get around 250-350 kbps because they have no line of site with the ISPs towers so they cannot even handle a full node right now. But suggesting it is fine to kick half my country off of running a full node isn't reasonable and paints a much different vision of bitcoin than I invested in.

The Market of economic users should decide(and is) on what the tradeoffs between capacity and decentralization are.(Not miners  or devs , although they are users themselves). They "vote" by choosing what implementation they run and not some gimmick that petitions devs or miners like with BU(although users should be free to use any implementation they choose). 
Personally, I will never follow a fork where I couldn't validate my own transactions. Bitcoin is no longer interesting or worth pursuing if it was centralized "paypal 2.0" with a horribly inefficient PoW database.

You still haven't clarified why you need "blocks" , "in a chain" to accomplish this . Everything you suggest can be accomplished with PKI and linked databases. What specifically is the advantage of creating blocks where validation occurs in intervals rather than just validating tx instantly between the shared validators  ? Are you suggesting that there is some technical improvement with batching these txs with PoS? Please elaborate because I believe this claim is extraordinary especially since we already see fintech companies pivot away from block as being pointless with their projects like corda. 
There are very specific reasons Bitcoin uses blocks and ~10 min intervals they all have to do with PoW , when you remove the work all I see is a buzzword.

There are plans to use more decimal places within the LN and other payment channels. Some exchanges already use sub satoshi fractions than round up when a client withdraws. This is trivial to do within layers and slightly more difficult to do within the main protocol. It is likely never to be needed in the main protocol because that will remain a "settlement" layer.

Your question isn't clear but if you intend to ask if there is a merchant processor that will Take CC FIAT and instantly convert it into BTC that will be deposited into a personal BTC address than that doesn't exist and really shouldn't because the merchant processor would be taking a huge risk by going from a fraud ridden and insecure payment method (CC's) to a secure bare instrument (bitcoin). 
This is the same reason you should never sell your real btc for forms or digital fraudulent and reversible fiat currency(paypal/money orders/credit cards/ect..) from strangers.

@_date: 2018-01-03 00:50:11


No such place exists because no one can predict the future price and sources of information typically are used to mislead you while the whales , or oracles giving the information trade into their advice. 
Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
	
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading 
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying
No one can predict the longterm or short term price. All we can say is this is the early adoption phase of bitcoin and some very exciting things are happening in bitcoin this month and next year to make bitcoin far more mainstream.
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 1-3 months fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both . 
Think long term. IMHO Try an accumulate as much as you can before 2020 to 2024.

The largest exchanges are slow to implement segwit, Once they do there will be a large spike.
In The interim you should use a segwit wallet.
**Wallet recommendations:**
Store it in a segwit wallet for better security and much less expensive transaction fees **saving 30-50% off fees** for the same confirmation priority.
**Wallets with segwit:** 
Armory (PC Advanced Full node Wallet)
trezor (Hardware wallet) Fee bumping only with electrum or Greenaddress/GreenBits use with wallet
ledger (Hardware wallet) Fee bumping only with electrum or Greenaddress/GreenBits use with wallet
Green address (Android, IOS , Web )   RBF Fee bumping 
 Greenbits (Native Android wallet) RBF Fee bumping
Samourai wallet (Android wallet)  RBF/CPFP  Fee bumping

Yes, but I would set it for 3 sats a byte , 1 sat a byte could take a while to confirm.

agreed, there are many people caught in thee mix for those years as well. It was also quite common for many to have made smaller investments of 2-15k during a year and never traded and just withdrew the BTC. These people lucked out. Ever after 2015 these rules basically apply -  in the US , which means now day traders have it rough, and if you simply buy and sell under 200 txs in a year and don't make any large purchases with BTC(homes, cars, land) than chances are you won't get caught. Of course this could all change with the IRS getting greedy and retroactively changing the rules again. Personally , I think they will have their hands full with daytraders alone , but we will see.

here is an analysis I did a while ago
**Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro vs Cash App** 
All these companies are insured and very easy to setup and verify with great UX. Due to its simplicity Cash App is a little easier to use out of the 3. All these methods require AML/KYC verification, cash app delays this until you withdraw the BTC.
**Pros**-- Easier to Use than coinbase pro. Allows you to lock in a price (but have to wait ~1 week) for BTC to be released which is helpful during a bull market.  
Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading=  ~1 week delay on withdrawing Bitcoin, more complex to use than cash app, highest fees with 1.49 % bank transfer and 3.99% debit card fees, overcharges on withdrawal fees or onchain transactions 
**Pros**-- Lowest fees of the 3 when you use a buy limit order = 0.15%, unlike coinbase pays for your onchain withdrawal fee(But the week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on fiat arriving preventing buying can make you lose BTC unlike the other 2)
Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading=  ~1 week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on depositing fiat with bank transfers before you can buy BTC, most complex to use of all 3
**Square Cash App**
**Pros**-- Easiest to use of the 3, Best alignment with Bitcoin politically, Allows you to lock in the price immediately and withdraw quickly(once verified), No fees to buy Bitcoin or withdraw bitcoin
**Cons**-- Only available in USA, despite having no fees their spread is slightly wider thus making them slightly more expensive that coinbase pro typically
Here is a complex price analysis comparing cash app to Coinbase, to coinbase pro I did a while ago.
So lets assume a 100 USD as a typical transaction for most. So when I do this on cash app I get 5295.75, and on coinbase pro I get 5236 (100-0.15%) so 0.01888 btc cash app 0.01906 coinbase pro = 0.00018 BTC difference or 94 cents higher on cash app ... but also keep in mind that cash app lets you instantly purchase BTC with a deposit showing instantly where you lock in the rate like coinbase which has a 1.49% fee instead of waiting 1 week so a better comparison would be 5227 (100-1.49%) =0.01884 BTC so cash app actually has lower fees in this regards.
Thus , if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar , but also likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount in a bull market.
Good idea to setup an account with either "Cash app and coinbase pro" or "gemini and cash app" if you are in the USA. Unless you live outside the USA , you should never use regular coinbase due to the fees. 
Use cash app during a bull market where you need to instantly lock in the price. Perhaps use coinbase pro in a Bear market where the delay won't hurt you or if you need to sell some Bitcoin.
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange. You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys. After buying your bitcoin withdraw them to your personal wallet**

For other readers here is the answer . 
1-2 sat per byte is an extremely low fee and no segwit used ... so that tells us there is no hope that the tx will ever get added to a block by waiting . Thus you need to manually use RBF or CPFP to bump the tx . Keep in mind that using -zapwallettxes and / or -rescan flags to clear the tx in core doesn't mean you actually solved the problem because every node within btc has its own separate mempool and while it may clear the tx and allow you to resend it you still run a risk that both may get confirmed .
Thus you can either do this -
which goes over the complicated manner in order to manually do the RBF fee bumping or follow this advice -
run bitcoin core with -zapwallettxes flag and than
Find all of the deleted unconfirmed transactions which you sent using some block explorer. (You don't need to do anything about deleted unconfirmed transactions which you received.) For each of them, do the following steps.
On the block explorer, note down all of the input addresses.
In Bitcoin Core, go to Settings -&gt; Wallet -&gt; check enable coin control features.
Go to the send tab. Click the inputs button. Select "tree mode"
Check any one of the input addresses found above. You'll want the one which results in the lowest fees. Do not expand any of the addresses to select only some of the address's coins -- you need to spend them all for this particular maneuver to work. (It's possible to do it by selecting just one input, but it's complicated to explain how to find the exact one you need.)
Optionally, you can add additional inputs if you want.
Send a transaction with a reasonable fee. You can send it to either yourself or to someone else -- it doesn't matter.
Here are the fees -

Lightning is a decentralized payment channel layer built ontop of bitcoin with popular wallets like eclair -
**Éclair** LN wallet for Android and desktop
Benefits are instant confirmations and fees per tx between 0 to less than a penny.  In the future all small purchases will be done on other layers like lightning
more info - 


Some exchanges like hodlhodl have integrating lightning trading and other exchanges are testing lightning like bistamp. Still a bit early for direct exchange support so you will have to withdraw onchain and open your own lightning channel in many cases. This is easy to do if you watch the video above on eclair.
 Some hardware wallets allow you to buy Bitcoin but grossly overcharge, so you want to buy on a regular exchange like cash app or coinbase pro and than withdraw to your hardware wallet.


Some hW wallets allow you to buy , I don't know any that allow you to sell as well right now but even if you could you never want to use these exchanges because the rates are horrible.

In most US states exchanges like gemini and coinbase only report to the IRS if you have 200 transactions with a value traded at least 20k USD ... **this means this primarily focuses on daytraders as most hodlers will never make 200 trades a year**
Here are the details - 
So if you are a daytrader you better file your taxes and good luck figuring it out when every single trade is a taxable event.

re-read my statement as you seem to be misunderstand. In no way did I claim that Bitcoin uses less energy now than years ago. The statement speaks about a specific concern as to how more energy needs to be used to secure BTC if the price increases which is untrue. You realize that more resources and energy is also needed to secure fiat as well if more value is held in it as well , right?

carousel fraud is one way large companies and cartels can avoid taxes in a VAT system among many other tools that medium to small businesses lack due to scale. 
I am doing my research as you suggest here - 
Nowhere does it suggest VAT only applying to some corporations. It says :


and 


Thus those 2 statements contradict/confuse each other so I have to assume perhaps 5-15% VAT with an average of 10% VAT? Or 5 to 10% VAT for everyone depending upon the goods or services sold? This sounds like everyone has to pay VAT.
Why doesn't he say anywhere VAT is only for a few large corporations as you suggest?
Are you familiar with the privacy implications of VAT vs sales tax as well?

I am not suggesting they going to start a new token distribution, just that they are planning on creating a new blockchain(with the same state) that is easier to design fresh than simply hardfork off existing codebase.

I already addressed New Zealand and Costa Rica  ... you seem to have a very short memory. Currency in general has an environmental impact to secure . Bitcoin is no worse to secure than fiat/PoS coins and thus its environmental impact is the same. If you are against all currency and the cost to secure anything of value than that is your prerogative but keep in mind barter is far worse for the environment than using currency.

Notice I said they are both the aggressors and make no excuses for horrible US behavior in the past(I am not from the USa and my country is a peaceful one without a standing military)
It is very naive to believe Iran when they suggest they simply want clean nuclear power when it would be far cheaper for them and easier to simply allow other nations to make bids on fuel. They don't even have to buy reactor fuel from the USA if they want as there are plenty of other countries that will sell to them from china to russia to france. 
They want a nuclear bomb. Do I believe they will immediately want to use a nuke on Israel like Hezbollah does? No, but nuclear proliferation will force more countries in that region to acquire nukes and certainly encourage more aggressive behavior from a dangerous state in that region

Reminder that premined Ethereum is a Scam-
1)	Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense  to the credulous. 
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine ignoring the 60 million they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus.
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) Advertising immutability and unstoppable contracts that were than immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. 
6)	For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.
Additionally, there are plenty of ICO's who have locked up Ethereum's and need to constantly sell them for fiat to pay for their burn rate going into next year which places a constant negative pressure on ETH price

I expect many altcoins to persist as we have seen , and for them to come and go as we have seen(lose most of their value).


Merchants and platforms supporting coins has a support and integration cost. They naturally will pick the ones with most users =Bitcoin , or just force their own token (paypal, libra, googlebucks...)


Sure, a Black swan even can happen. No one is denying this. Is it likely? No. 


Market cap doesn't mean much as most of scams like XRP and ETH have most their liquidity locked up. If any other decentralized cryptocurrency burned more security or had more users than Bitcoin that would be a better metric to see Bitcoin no longer being dominant. If this did occur , it would permanently ruin any suggestion of "store of value" as a long term investment in any cryptocurrency as we would always doubt furture altcoins that became dominant would go the way of Bitcoin. Not a huge deal , but definitely a blow to certain value propositions in this ecosystem as these tokens would merely become temporary stores of value people did not trust longterm.

**Bech32 (Addresses that start with BC1)**
Pros -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~36-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
Pros -
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
Cons -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32

As the Coinbase reward(nothing to do with the company but referring to Bitcoins inflation rate) drops a greater percentage of Bitcoins Block reward will be composed of transaction fees to pay for security. This means that on other layers like lightning millions of transaction fees will remain low (0 to less than a penny) and consolidate to larger fees onchain to cover the diminishing inflation. This will be a slow and gradual process that is already occuring and we may start to see instances in as soon as 2020 where total collected tx fees are larger than the coinbase reward.

I agree we need some privacy improvements onchain like dandelion , schnorr sigs and MAST , but unless CT can be made more efficient I don't think its a worthwhile tradeoff onchain.
personally I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi) than the base layer because:
1)	The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain.
2)	It is important to give users the option of transparency and audibility onchain, at least for accounts they choose to expose.
3)	In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
4)	privacy  tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs

These technical limitations often aren't limitations but features and many altcoins are simply benefiting from the fact that they are not targeted from attackers because they are worth much less , very illiquid, and get the scaling benefit of simply not being popular and low fees because their token is unpopular and not worth much(fees are priced in the innate token)
Take Ethereum as an example that could barely handle one silly app (cryptokitties) when it is supposed to be the world computer handling millions of apps and almost no one including Vitalik dares to run a full archival ETH node now.

One of the best ways to impress family and strangers of the power of Bitcoin is not preaching them about it but either:
1) Take them to a restaurant or bar that accepts BTC and has staff trained to know how to use it(you will need to test them beforehand) . Eat at the restaurant with your friends and family and pay the bill with Bitcoin and they will be the one asking questions and impressed because they are almost always under the false impression that you cannot spend the BTC for everyday goods and services. 
2) Give them some BTC as a gift. Easy way is to send it to them with coinbase where they don't even need a wallet to receive it . Years later when your 50 or 100 usd gift is worth 1000 usd they will start asking about bitcoin and be interested in buying more.

Cartels are still almost completely using US dollars and banks to money launder. Believe me , we would notice if they starting using Bitcoin as the price would shoot up way past 100k a BTC overnight.
Part of the reason I think cartels are still using US dollars -
1) transitioning their very large infrastructure and distribution system will take time
2) They have contracts with corrupt banks in place to money launder and breaking these contracts will make many people upset 
3) Bitcoin lacks liquidity and ease to quickly convert large amounts of fiat into BTC in a fungible way . 
Number 3 is the main reason IMHO, so we just have to wait for Bitcoins market cap to grow and than the cartel will begin using it. Should take at least 1-4 more years IMHO

Certain attack vectors can occur where the malicious party prompting a non cooperative channel closure can use CPFP to increase the size of a tx by chaining another tx and increasing the weight but only moderately increasing the fee where the tx still exists in the mempool but has a lower priority despite the small increase in fee and forcing the victim to pay a higher fee. This is essentially a way to perform a temporary DDOS /grief attack. This is costly for the attacker as well, but these changes are intended to address these concerns

This is a well propagated Myth that sergio started that isn't backed up by good evidence(the evidence he presented even contradicts itself at times). Media ran with it because its a provocative story. The reality is :
1) We have no idea who satoshi is and how many Bitcoins he has if he is alive and if he controls the private keys
2) His "supposed" coins that he controls have never moved , and no one has claimed one of the 100+ UTXO split altcoins on them
3) A more thorough analysis shows there might have been a dominant miner / or mining group early on but at most these have around 700k BTC , not 1-1.2m BTC
This analysis does not conclude a single miner mined these BTC as there are multiple explanations for why we see this ExtraNonce pattern that have nothing to do with a single miner. 
4) There were multiple people mining early on 
5) The only 2 blocks that we definitely know belong to satoshi (block 9 and genesis) do not fit the pattern of the dominant miner 
that might have 700k BTC , only 11 blocks fit the pattern that we know satoshi controls .
IMHO whoever mined those coins either lost the private keys(very common back than as BTC was worth nothing and few expected it to last. large sums of BTC were lost all the time) or is dead because Bitcoin has had many scary moments over the years and for someone to control that amount of BTC and not move them to more secure addresses at least once, claim utxo splits , or even cash out on a little during one of many bubbles has an almost inhuman amount of willpower.

Under the gear icon on top right &gt; click experimental features &gt; Native segwit to allow bech32 addresses as well which are even better , but you may want to also use a regular p2sh segwit account because some businesses have not upgraded to accept the newest address types. 
**Bech32 (Addresses that start with BC1)**
Pros -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~36-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
Pros -
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
Cons -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32
**Legacy P2PKH Addresses (addresses that start with 1)**
Pros - none 
Cons-  slower confirmations and higher tx fees , bloats the blockchain unnecessarily

This isn't my whole argument , and its a well accepted economic principle


Than I would suggest simply admitting you need to do more research and investigate more rather than make assumptions with topics that you lack understanding in. 


My country of costa rica supposedly has no military either... guess what? ... its a lie , we have Militaries, just pathetically weak Militaries.. The "military" is just a mixture of what people in the USA call a bunch of SWAT teams with weapons and some military vehicles, also countries like New Zealand and my country of Costa Rica are largely protected under the umbrella of the USA and NATO, at a cost of sovereignty and privacy. We are essentially colonies of the USA in many ways.

There are fundamentally different security assumptions. Bitcoin trades most of its human security and consensus for ASICs/Energy. Both Bitcoin and Fiat require "nodes" for processing and validating and developers to maintain their infrastructure so pretty much a wash there. Fiat on the other hand has large teams of lawyers, accountants, regulators, economists, fraud investigators to secure it (not including the military I already mentioned), Bitcoin doesn't require any of this overhead. If armies start attacking Bitcoin mining farms that will simply better secure Bitcoin by further decentralizing the location of ASICs, so there won't be a need to have high security at ASIC farms in the future either as those miners that don't have this overhead will be more efficient than miners that do.
Further reading - 


In order to account for this environmental externality with fiat you would need to add up all the human effort in order to secure fiat , calculate their total carbon output of these humans , than take a % of that based upon their efforts at work in order to secure fiat to account for the wasted resources due to the need to secure that form of PoS

Currency has value because the collective set of users give it value. This value can be amplified by the network effect of users making a currency more useful= Metcalfe’s Law
Bitcoin has value because its users find it useful and this value is amplified by its scarcity


Ethereum is absurd because there is no censorship risk in code execution thus is an act of supererogation that is unscalable and with a large attack surface.
Bitcoin has an innate scripted language for smart contracts, and being "turing complete" is not a feature but a huge security vulnerability and only useful to scam the credulous who don't know better. 


Before you invest in Bitcoin you should investigate the inelastic demand for it and its circular economy of users who need to use it.

sender pays the fee not you, unless you are withdrawing from an exchange and they charge you a fee to withdraw. Protip- coinbase **pro** charges no withdraw fee and pays the onchain tx fee for you. 
Thus if you send your btc to a p2sh segwit address instead of native segwit this means that any future txs you make will have a slightly higher fee for same priority(notice the numbers I cite)


The opposite is true. The earlier you get the BTC into a native segwit the better as the general trend is BTC fees to go up simply due to the fact that the more valuable BTC is the more in dollar terms the fees are. Thus even if you pay the same 1/sat a byte tx fee with btc = 10k , the moment BTc = 100k fees in USD terms will be 10x higher so you want your BTc to be sitting in a native segwit address and have some preloaded lightning channels before the next appreciation bubble. 


You create 2 accounts , one native segwit and the other segwit , get the receive address from native segwit , and than send btc from regular segwit to native segwit

Bitcoin is the least volatile cryptocurrency(except perhaps some stablecoins but those can barely can be defined as a cc)  now and thus is the best unit of account as a day to day currency unlike altcoins. Bitcoin also has the most users, merchants, and network effect so is the best cc as a currency in that respect as well. Bitcoin has some of the lowest tx fees on L2 so is an excellent currency there as well.

Because barter is worse for the environment and the impact to secure BTC is the same as fiat


There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus **decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin** even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

There are 2 motivations:
1) CPFP is a legit usecase to lower fees on multiple txs and miners are not simply motivated by profit

It all sounds pretty crazy to me , especially with everyone of them raising their hands in the first debate for forcing tax payers to pay for illegal aliens healthcare. I'm a tico from costa rica , and this sounds crazy to me. Most countries will arrest you and deport you if you are illegal. Why do people in the USA allow people to illegally come in their country? If someone wants to come in they should apply like anyone else and follow the laws. If I wanted to move and  become a US citizen  I would be pissed off at others skipping the lines and breaking laws.  
There has been only a few small test cases of UBI from what I understand, so the fact that it isn't well studied at scale is an issue in itself. Not a good idea to jump directly in it with the largest economy in the world. 
My country just switched from sales tax to VAT and it is horrible, and the cartel and larger companies will still be able to commit tax fraud with the carousal method while small stores not have a much larger burden. I'm sure those VAT databases will be hacked and corruptly sold for anti-competitive ends as well.

Securing any currency , Bitcoin, PoS coins , or fiat is directly related to their underlying value. There is no way to get around this. Directly or Indirectly the costs to secure assets and currencies are high. These costs always use real resources and have an effect on the environment
Fiat currency is a form of PoS coin. Ultimately militaries secure a fiat currency. Do you understand how bad militaries are on the environment?
You need to understand the economic principle of "rent" when it deals with PoS staking and bonds to understand why this is true. 
If are too lazy to read and try and understand the material just skip down to your oracle Vitalik where he goes along with Paul's math(because he cannot refute what is demonstrably true and proven) that PoS = PoW ultimately in the environmental impact and efficiencies of staking vs mining and than attempts to change the goal posts by suggesting PoS could be more secure which I would disagree with but is beyond the discussion in the article and our discussion right here

You are not stuck with a false dichotomy of either only using Bitcoin or only using fiat. You can leverage the strengths of each when appropriate to your benefit. Bitcoin is a useful tool to use for many use cases. Lets explorer a few of them:
1) **Saving money** - Buy 500 USD of BTC on coinbase pro for 0.15% , transfer BTC to purse.io for 0 fee , Buy products on amazon for 18% off(after purse fee). Total saved is 90 USD - 0.75 USd (total spent on fees) = 89.25 USD saved with Bitcoin
2) **Regulatory Arbitrage** = Capital flight , Buying less expensive and higher quality drugs on the DNM in a much safer manner , avoiding civil asset forfeiture, effects of bail ins and bail outs, insurance for frozen bank accounts, etc.. 
3) **Timestamping** - Rather than driving to and paying a notary to authenticate a contract or statement you can do so for a very small tx fee or free with opentimestamps or other services like tweetstamp that is even more trustworthy than a notary
4) **Payment Rail** - Many merchants use Bitcoin as a payment rail where they auto convert to fiat so have piratically 0 risk from volatility and get the many benefits like no merchant credit card processing fees and no chargeback risk
5) **Digital Gold** -Some people treat Bitcoin as an investment, where they Buy some and wait for it to mature in a couple years than take profits . Bitcoin is disinflationary so over the years has appreciated a lot making it one of the best investments one can make -

Thank you for all your thoughts and contributions. I enjoyed reading your article and have some feedback.


100% agree which is one reason among other I oppose wallet like blockchain.com


Yes, with the different repos peer reviewing each other and contributing upstream


Perhaps a 2 of 2 multisig between secure element in smartphone and well vetted HW wallet is the solution here to mitigate these concerns


Good idea. Here are some of the best ways to monetize wallets and pay for support and maintenance :
1) Premium support. Issue here is this competes with free support elsewhere and doesn't scale well as we don't want devs to be focused answering emails. Perhaps business support for larger companies with higher paying contracts?
2) Additional features like coinjoin mixing found in your wallet wasabi and others like samourai
3) Premium features like Bitcoin satellite txs and liquid which likely will be found in blockstream green in the future 
Many wallets these days are monetizing by producing a shitcoin or ICO or integrating horrible exchanges that overcharge ignorant users which I do not like. 
The closest we have these days too a perfect wallet is electrum+HW wallet+electrum personal server or Blockstream Green+HW wallet+full node or coldcard+wasabi+full node
The three solutions above are far better than anything we had before but still suffering from major UX issues and all have some shortcomings. Electrum when they release lightning integration might be able to get a bit closer to an ideal wallet.

You aren't insinuating they are going to buy the bags of altcoins are you? These companies may create their own token(like libra), if allowed, but that is about it. 


unlikely, they already have the mindshare , why do they need to buy into another project when they can launch their own? Also, legally , they and the government have to control the coin so cannot use an existing altcoin


that app did not come preloaded on most samsung phones but in a very restricted region


they will want to control their coin , as they have to , and it will be heavily regulated , so perhaps Libra will eventually get approval, but they won't be using any existing altcoin. 


USD is what is dominant, and fiat isn't going away anytime soon.

**Wallet recommendations:**
Store it in a segwit wallet for better security and much less expensive transaction fees.
**Wallets with segwit:** armory, trezor, ledger, Green address , Greenbits, Samourai wallet , core (manually) 
If you use an insecure OS like windows or OSX and cannot afford a HW wallet store your BTC in Samourai wallet, Green address , Greenbits  on a cell phone.
If you have a lot of bitcoins you will want to use either paper wallets or hardware wallets.
Paper wallets are not for beginners but if you want to educate yourself read this- 
If you need a multi currency wallet the only three secure ones available now are ledger , trezor and digital bitbox .

I would stay away from that project. You understand their are many altcoins with lower fees than bcash right?
You will not get a non biased perspective from anyone regarding BCH and BTC . I am biased towards bitcoin so keep that in mind as I explain to you the differences - 
**Bitcoin (BTC) –**
99% of developer/specialist support with deep knowledge in cryptography, development, security with a proven track record of release secure well tested code and an ethos in minimizing centralization and maintaining compatibility, fungibility and privacy
Far more hashrate - 
Larger community of users with much better network effect
99% of merchant support
Far less mining centralization
Far more node decentralization
Most devs Road map is for conservative scaling and focus on security , privacy and fungibility.
Current capacity allowance is 14 TPS (transactions per second) average with most txs using segwit and millions of txs per second for LN payment channels (used right now but awaiting GUI development finished for widespread use)
LN wallets we are testing right now –
**B Cash (BCH)**
One of 10+ UTXO altcoin spinoffs from Bitcoin
Few developers that are far less competent 
Roadmap is focusing on cheap tx fees and many hard forks for larger capacity blocks at the risk of centralization and lower security. Favors externalizing costs onto full nodes and users 
Currently doesn't have transaction malleability fixed so is stuck with a mere 56TPS max throughput. Their focus is primarily on onchain scaling but do open the possibility up for L2.
Introduced another vulnerability with the HF called EDA that caused wild erratic difficulty swings and more inflation. They Hard forked to try and fix this with the DAA but thus far their difficulty is still more erratic than bitcoin.
Is still vulnerable to this PoW vulnerability -  which is largely neutralized in bitcoin with segwit
Still has not balanced UTXO costs and no plans to do so.
High likelihood of a price crash once some exchanges like Coinbase/GDAX free up coins and users can sell them . An estimated 10% of all Bcash coins are still held within CoinBase

Since you are concerned with fees You will not want to transfer to mycelium as it lacks segwit so fees will be 30-50% higher . 
**Wallet recommendations:**
Store it in a segwit wallet for better security and much less expensive transaction fees.
**Wallets with segwit:** armory, trezor, ledger, Green address , Greenbits, Samourai wallet , core (manually) 
Withdrawing your btc from gdax is free , from coinbase a few dollars , therefore best to  transfer from gdax to coinbase for free , than to your personal wallet

than you can reduce your tax exposure by capital gains losses. This doesn't mean you get back 27k usd in taxes or a refund , but that you have 27k less in taxable exposure. Thus if you income was 100k after all writeoffs and deductions , you will only have to pay taxes on 73k
edit - this is only if you made a single trade from one coin to another or fiat that realized this loss , if you made many trades sliding down from 50k to 27 k than you need to calculate the loss or gain with each trade and figure out the total which is an accounting nightmare

Several reasons - Legacy nodes validate only 99% of the rules and segwit nodes validate 100% of the rules
Using segwit tx within a hardware wallet is more secure by speeding up tx signing and simplifying it 
segwit txs also make the whole network more secure by rebalancing UTXO costs

This is nonsense. It will cost 20-50 cents with segwit to load a channel as there doesn't need to be high priority. Worst comes to worst and if txs end up costing 100 dollars(not going to happen) as you suggest one could always simply allow exchanges to amortize the costs of loading the channels for users and than selling those preloaded channels at a cost of 10-20 cents each user.

Bitcoin is more fungible than fiat and provides regulatory arbitrage. Bitcoin with l2 layers allows for micro txs between trust minimized machines or humans. Bitcoin allows for digital scarcity.

But ETH is fundamentally absurd at it very core and makes some intrinsic mistakes that cannot be undone and will not possibly lead to any efficiencies. It is rotten at its very core and not understanding why this is the case will lead to a ton of wasted effort of misallocation of resources. It is absolutely absurd to pay the highcost of cryptocurrency "fuel" to run some simple code that doesn't have censorship risk 


I am not predicting short term price as there exists a ton of dumb money and credulous investors . I am saying there technically cannot be an efficiency found because there is no censorship risk in code execution and blockchains are extremely inefficient by design. 
Are you suggesting there is censorship risk in code execution? Are you suggesting there is a possible efficiency that can be found?

Cheers. Here are some other problems with leaving BTC on exchanges:
Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit

ethereum is fucked either way. Rootstock and simplicity are better products and ethereum cannot scale. 
Additionally, there are plenty of ICO's who have locked up Ethereum's and need to constantly sell them for fiat to pay for their burn rate going into next year which places a constant negative pressure on ETH price
Since Jun 17th ethereum has been crashing against bitcoin value week after week and I expect this trend to continue.

I believe so , but that is essentially the same thing as eth PoW fees as rootstock is merge mined
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:57:08
2 issues , Coinomi is not a very secure wallet and lacks segwit so either tx fees will be 30-50% higher or will take much longer to confirm . As you can see from the price movements bitcoin is at the start of a large bubble of mass adoption so the mempool is really full further delaying matters and increasing the need for higher fees for quick confirmations
You will eventually get a confirmation but in the future use a segwit wallet and preferably one with rbf that allows fee bumping
RBF allows fee bumping where you can manually set a very low fee and than bump it up if you get impatient and want a quicker confirmation . Wallets like green address have this . 
**Wallet recommendations:**
Store it in a segwit wallet for better security and much less expensive transaction fees saving 30-50% off fees for the same confirmation priority.
**Wallets with segwit:** armory, trezor, ledger, Green address , Greenbits, Samourai wallet , core (manually)

I don't understand what you are trying to suggest here. Ethereum has 0 chance of being a useful project besides facilitating scams and taking money from credulous investors. 
This is a fundamental design flaw that cannot be solved by any patch or trick if you understand there is no censorship in code execution , nor can there effectively be in the future . There is censorship in value transfer , but no one will be able to prevent you from running code on your computer. 
More details here- 
Joseph Lubin is still too scared to take up Jimmy in his bet that ETH will be a useful project 5 years from now, thus even ETH greatest investors deep down know that Eth likely won't lead to any efficiencies or solve any real world problems -

Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading -
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying

You are redefining the term developer here to include amateurs just starting to learn to program. Most real developers work on bitcoin.


So its on the threshold of forcing users running the standard 240-250 GB SSD to upgrade to a larger hard drive . So another ~200 usd for pc users and apple users to spend ~480 usd without installation. Sounds fantastic. Great way to encourage a diversity of full nodes .

There are many reasons why both are better. For one thing neither of them have a premine of 72 million tokens. Than there are many aspects like simplicity not being "turing complete", and it can be verified with static analysis before the smart contract is run to determine the range or upper bound limits of any contract before execution which is critical for security.

which is why a gift from custodial solution like coinbase is a good starting point. You don't need to waste their time setting up a wallet, they get the email saying so and so gave them 100 usd of BTc and the click on it and validate their email and done. Than they forget about it for 2 years until the hear about the price of BTC and than rush to log back into coinbase who is managing their private keys and than come asking you what to do and how to buy more which is than when you help them withdraw the BTC and teach them about Bitcoin and security. If they don't verify the BTC in 60 days it goes back to your wallet(which is nice as they know you tried to give them 100 USD gift even though they were to lazy to verify an email)
I have gifted hundreds of people Bitcoin this way when it was worth much less and they are all really happy years later. Some either spend the whole amount on a nice vacation , and others start learning and buying more. More than half start their education and investing more in BTC from my experience, and thee others who spend it all still find a newfound respect for BTC.

We shouldn't assume it was a state setup, but it may have been and at least looks as if it was a setup where the 16year old girl was lying about her age to extort money from sugar daddies later. 


Really is a shame that prostitution is illegal. It is extremely unethical that it is illegal and places everyone in danger. minors should not legally be able to prostitute but the fact that prostitution is illegal in many jurisdictions means that "johns" need to use shady dating sites without proper oversight.


We need more facts before making judgment. She at least lied about her age to the site because it was 18 and up. It is also hard to tell the difference between a 16 year old and an 18 year old by looking at them. Did she tell him her age? Why did she go to the cops if she consented to prostitution?

It has always been my position to avoid tether even if it is a scam or not. 
1) Tether is not well regulated and not FDIC insured. Fiat in gemini and coinbase are FDIC insured up to $250,000 usd per person. Tether has no obligation to make someone whole or redeem their tokens for fiat or btc as per their terms 
2) Tether is mainly used to invest in scams , and use sketchier exchanges thus the fact that you may be using it means you are more likely going to lose money anyways
3) Tether is used by daytraders often . Don't daytrade and keep your funds off exchanges . You own 0 BTC if tether controls those private keys

Proof of Stake is not new or very interesting, and exists as a form with fiat currency already.
Proof of stake has many more attack vectors(nothing at stake attacks, long range attacks, short range attacks , stake grinding attacks) than proof of work and ultimately is either less efficient or less secure.
Further reading -
There doesn't seem to be any foreseeable solutions to making proof of stake secure either besides obscuring the flaws. Bitcoin is deliberately made inefficient with proof of work as using provable work that is external to the blockchain is the only means to create real costs where the game theory supports a model where it is both profitable to secure BTC and extremely costly to attack it.
With PoW (proof of work) you would need to be a tremendous amount of effort in order to censor 1-2 blocks with building many asic mining farms, and than burning the electricity continuously in order to attack bitcoin.
With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before) to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff such an attack because it involves outside resources.
There are many different variations of proof of stake but the simplest way to understand this is by looking at those blockchain's as a democratic consensus mechanism where everyone's vote is weighted based upon how many coins or stake they control. Their staked coins than have an opportunity to create a block without proof of work and a dev controlling 51% of the coins gets to virtually mint ~51% on average of all the blocks . This presents another concern as the coins typically need to be in "hot wallets" to do so instead of cold storage leading to a more insecure environment.
Since most PoS coins have massive premines where only a small number of devs control most of the coins this also presents another concern as those devs can be targeted by states , hackers, or attackers or as we often see with altcoin devs they pump and dump a project and than move onto a competing project to repeat this cycle over and over again thus have an incentive to attack their old project.
With Proof of work , seizing the coins or stake of any individual or group of people doesn't effect the process of mining or securing the network directly at all . They can only try and spook the market by dumping coins at a discount while individuals like myself will happily buy up all the discounted coins.
PoS is being sought because it is a clever marketing ploy to attract environmentalists who are concerned about the electricity used in PoW mining. They may have valid concerns that I also share but they fail to see all the external costs in PoS.
It is akin to not adding up all the inefficiencies in coming to a consensus in a democratic presidential election.
Watch this video -
There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

Most likely scenario based upon the circumstances IMHO is she lied to the site and him about her age. There is no reason he would be so stupid to sleep with a minor when he is so actively targeted and hated. Than she tried to blackmail him using her real age as leverage and he turned her down. Than either she went to one of many people who want him taken down with an offer to assist with payment or simply turned him in for revenge due to him not giving into extortion. 
Either way , we should not call him a rapist like the media and others are doing. Legally it can be called "statutory rape" but when someone is being conned into sleeping with a minor that really isn't a fair judgment either. Either way , they are going to throw the book at him if he is extradited and he will see prison time due to him openly antagonizing the state so much. There is nothing governments hate more than those who openly show how hypocritical they are.

Having a base protocol that can be transparent if the user so chooses is important as well and one reason why xmr isn't listed on many exchanges. It is more than likely that regulators and states will simply outlaw and restrict coins that have privacy as their key focus which indirectly will ironically reduce their privacy due to a lower subset of users and garner more scrutiny to anyone using XMR or buying and selling it on onramps and offramps. We are already seeing this happen with services like changely and shapeshift where they are freezing funds from people using XMR at times

Miners have gradually been collecting a larger percentage of the total block reward in fees every 4 years than the inflation reward. Thus there is already a slow and gradual transition from inflation to tx fees occurring as inflation drops. There will only be ~21 million BTC minted by 2140 , never any more. Bitcoin is already divisible by 1/1000 of a satoshi on lightning thus there are no concerns with divisibility as 11+ decimal places is more than enough for worldwide adoption.

not much as market cap is a mostly misleading number.
market cap becomes a meaningless number if new altcoins with massive premines get introduced weekly where all the liquidity is locked up. With proof of work a miner must spend almost as much as we gets in value. Not the case with massive premines and PoS where the artificial value is created out of nowhere and it is trivial to create a large marketcap.

Hopefully you aren't so credulous as to believe that Bitmain spent all that extra money on the patent , attached FPGA and development to support ASICBOOST and not use it themselves especially since the evidence from their odd block creation is explained by the use of covert ASICBOOST which they admit is integrated into their miners after others discovered it.

Counterpoints- 8) In the extremely unlikely scenario that governments pull a 180 and outlaw bitcoin on the white market, bitcoin can still exist on the grey and black markets and be extremely successful. Lets make the wild assumption that every country outlaws bitcoin and imposes extremely stiff penalties discouraging grey market use. If bitcoin would simply encompass a very small marketshare of 5% of the blackmarket than each coin will be worth over 100k usd.

2) Any attacks on the network can be dealt with by developers rolling out a quick change to regain power to the users. I.E.. If a miner controlling over 51% of hash power attacked the network we could roll in PoS with PoW to lower the influence of mining alone. This is just one solution among many. Additionally, I would rather deal with a hypothetical potential attack on the network rather than a continuous attack (bail ins , bail outs, ect...) that we currently have with fiat.

I may agree that a compromise may be a good idea, but your assertion is false. There are multiple lines that would need to be changed because of this -

I am perfectly prepared for this to happen but at this stage I believe it to be unlikely(at least for the US) because-
1) It would be politically embarrassing for them to pull a 180 on federal guidelines. The most I can see is many local states start to impose their own versions of the bitliscence and than Bitcoin would start to simply default more towards a currency used on the internet. 
2) There are already many large businesses and wealthy businessmen who are heavily invested in bitcoin. They are the same people who are politically connected and bribe politicians as the banks do. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:23:24
1) Almost all of the community agrees that disinflation and 21 million cap is intrinsic to the properties that define Bitcoin. Any divergence on this principle would be a betrayal to earlier investors. This can never happen in practice because we define bitcoin as having these properties and any change in distribution would simply be considered an Alt being forked off and unlikely to attract many followers wanting to purposely lower their value of savings.

Full nodes who still have to process the higher capacity but due to be sourced from the same "airport" can conveniently handle the extra less necessary luggage (signatures) as opposed to using full node trains/boats processing the segregated data (signatures) which represent the complexity and difficulty in rolling out these important changes with a hard fork.

As with most open source repositories including XT and linux. It isn't like this hasn't been tried before.

@_date: 2015-12-08 09:22:29


Satoshi's opinion is moot at this stage although his expectations and vision was amazingly accurate in this respect. You incorrectly insist upon miners controlling consensus where the current status quo balances consensus between developers/nodes/miners/merchants and exchanges who each control different layers of influence and none can unilaterally control the outcome independently. This doesn't mean that I don't agree with some of your concerns with mining centralization. There are steps we can take to decentralize mining a bit further by focusing on the natural advantages and incentives small and independent miners have over the liabilities large miner farms have.   
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:38:29
4) Difficulty is self adjusting so efficient miners will always be profitable. If tx fees don't adequately replace block rewards than more efficient ASICs will be rolled in and used which require less electricity. There is already an incredible amount of hashing security- 1000x + all of googles servers and even a slight drop in difficulty would be fine. The greater concern is a balanced distribution of hashing power... and there are incentives that will decentralize this in the future.
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:45:07
Do we really want democratic "mob rule" deciding individual features? The current balance suggests that one must be at least technically competent to maintain a repository codebase in order to offer an alternative. This creates a minimum level competency test to insure the proposed features are being added by someone with a minimum degree of ability. The actual vote happens when people decide what implementation to run. I support an environment where multiple implementations exist and compete and believe this is healthy. Forcing volunteers that work on core/XT/UL/ect.. to do our bidding isn't how open source projects work and isn't fair to them.  
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:42:20


Agreed, but bitcoin has always had and still does have a scripting language.

Ethereum is a premined scam.
1)	Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense  to the credulous. 
2) ETH is an highly centralized illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.
Additionally, there are plenty of ICO's who have locked up Ethereum's and need to constantly sell them for fiat to pay for their burn rate going into next year which places a constant negative pressure on ETH price
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:51:25

1) ASIC's are actually extremely efficient at converting electricity to heat. 98-99% efficient. This heat can be recycled.
2) Almost all mining is being done with renewable energy right now. Most principally unused hydroelectric in china that would simply go to waste without those ASIC farms capturing the energy
3) When comparing the energy used in mining to traditional fiat you must analyze all the energy consumed in regulation, auditing, accounting, building infrastructure, security, ect to fairly compare the two 
There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

@_date: 2015-12-07 23:43:43
Satoshi did expect and intend for this level of mining centralization- 
"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate." 
I don't agree completely with his vision or think his opinion should matter much at this point, although I do respect his foresight. There are other incentives that may decentralize mining soon and I can see a balance in the future between p2p nodes and large factories of asics.

Full nodes validate the rules onchain. 
Miners order transactions onchain. 
Even if 100% of the miners attempt to change the rules or remove some of them they have no effect upon my bitcoins directly. 
This is not the case with drivechains. 


Or simply split the coins to separate the new altcoin the miners created , dump their new coin to single digits and reinvest in the original chain while waiting for sha256 to come back and mine the chain that is paying them. 
This is why many of us oldtimers weren't intimidated with the segwit2x attack a year ago , we have plenty of BTC to vote on the chain we have skin in the game with and have worked hard to build bitcoin over the years where we won't be so easily intimidated and are willing to sacrifice to insure bitcoin survives and grows.

Potentially, but there is a distinction between bitcoins distribution inflation rate which will be cut in half and the true inflation rate which is influenced by adoption. What Trace is essentially suggesting is if no new adoption (unlikely) occurs than bitcoin will have a better inflation rate than 20% of countries. The reality is more complex than that as the amount of liquidity plays into matters but you get the general idea.

Keep in mind that the developers who are working on Bitcoin Unlimited or Core or Libbitcoin are volunteers. They are incentivized to volunteer principally because they have control to shape the code as they prefer. If the users can directly recommend features and over-rule their opinions with direct democracy than 3 problems occur- 
1) You remove the fun and pride they have in their own work. Now they are just the employees(actually slaves) of the users where they are expected to write code they may have technical or philosophical disagreements with. Like most open source projects this marks the death of the repository and most volunteers will simply lose interest and walk away. 
2) Many users aren't technically competent enough to make informed recommendations directly. I.E... I repeatedly see that many keep reporting the myth that raising the block limit is as simple as changing one variable when in reality other lines of code would need to be changed to prevent dangerous attack DDOS validation attack vectors- "In 2MB blocks, a 2MB transaction can be constructed that may take over 10 minutes to validate which opens up dangerous denial-of-service attack vectors. Other lines of code would need to be changed to prevent these problems."
3) There are unaddressed sybil attack vectors that would be introduced with this proposal.
If Bitcoin unlimited allowed the users the popular vote and they decided to decrease the block limit do you really think that the developers would happily go along with this vote?

Here is some general info for starting out as well – 
Do not store your bitcoin on exchanges or webwallets
Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are familiar technically with bitcoin.  99 % of alts/ICOs are scams and it is best to understand the basics before investing.
Do not daytrade
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 
Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well 
Do not mine until you have done at least 100 hours of research

Mostly true, but it depends upon what you are relating the fiat to. For example the Israeli Shekel appreciated against the dollar around ~2% in 2015. As a general rule of thumb all fiat is inflationary and has a negative return rate with regards to a general basket of goods and services.
In 2014 Bitcoin was the worst performing currency but in the other 5 years has been wildly the best performing currency by far.

This new research and work simply attempts to solve the underlying security problems by adding complexity which is typically disastrous for a secure platform without addressing the underlying weakness. It is critically important for there to be a tangible, objective, and external cost to security. 


If even 100% of the BTC hashrate attempts to change or modify the rules this has absolutely no effect upon my full node. Miners simply order txs and economic full nodes validate txs and blocks. 
Also as explained there is an objective external cost with PoW that doesn't exist with PoS.


You would have to physically hold hostage these people and managers which would be noticeable, unlike with PoS.

An Airline only allows you to bring a limited amount of weight and bags onboard a plane for your luggage. They have to be fair and have a consistent policy for their passengers while at the same time recognize real life physical limitations and risks. There is a careful balance to be made where they make their clients happy with allowing them more luggage but at the same time keep the weight considerations reasonable for speed , limiting fuel costs and safety.
They previously had a policy of allowing 2 carry on bags weighing 10 Kg in total, but overtime with a growing economy their clients grew more wealthy and needed to travel with more bags because they were flying to Aruba for 2 week vacations, instead of 1 week. The clients were demanding more bags and up to 40 Kg of luggage weight. They had a choice to increase the size of the plane but the accountants and engineers were concerned because the fuel costs would increase and the safety of the planes may be compromised as well with so much weight. The sales department also voiced an objection that larger planes would cut down on their flying routes leading to less possible destinations clients could visit.
It was known since 2011 a safe and effective solution would be to separate the less critical luggage on a train or boat and the important luggage could go with the client to solve these problems but the airline kept delaying these changes because of distribution and contract problems with the railroad/shipyard companies. Redirecting every railroad or shipping route would be a logistical nightmare. Another concern is passengers didn't want their luggage being mixed or misplaced within the trains/boats as they were keen on some of the new quick luggage check-in and fraud protection processes the airlines were developing and there is no way they could get any of that with dumping their luggage on a train or boat.
One day a bright young engineer recommended a novel approach to solve these concerns. He indicated, "Look, we already have shipping agreements with Fedex/DHL and lease out a certain amount of space on their cargo planes that flyout from the same airports. We would have to increase capacity on them but they are efficient and we won't have to reroute all the trains or deal with the nasty railroad companies and our passengers could still bring their important luggage through our new fraud protection and quick check-in processes. Our passengers won't have to pay more and get everything they want. We will have to secure larger contracts with the airfreight companies but ultimately they will benefit from more business and we will benefit from more flight routes and clients." ... followed by an applause from the board of directors and some quick recommendations to roll out the long awaited changes immediately.

Proof of Stake is not new or very interesting, and exists as a form with fiat currency already.
Proof of stake has many more attack vectors(nothing at stake attacks, long range attacks, short range attacks , stake grinding attacks) than proof of work and ultimately is either less efficient or less secure.
Further reading -
There doesn't seem to be any foreseeable solutions to making proof of stake secure either besides obscuring the flaws. Bitcoin is deliberately made inefficient with proof of work as using provable work that is external to the blockchain is the only means to create real costs where the game theory supports a model where it is both profitable to secure BTC and extremely costly to attack it.
With PoW (proof of work) you would need to be a tremendous amount of effort in order to censor 1-2 blocks with building many asic mining farms, and than burning the electricity continuously in order to attack bitcoin.
With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before) to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff such an attack because it involves outside resources.
There are many different variations of proof of stake but the simplest way to understand this is by looking at those blockchain's as a democratic consensus mechanism where everyone's vote is weighted based upon how many coins or stake they control. Their staked coins than have an opportunity to create a block without proof of work and a dev controlling 51% of the coins gets to virtually mint ~51% on average of all the blocks . This presents another concern as the coins typically need to be in "hot wallets" to do so instead of cold storage leading to a more insecure environment.
Since most PoS coins have massive premines where only a small number of devs control most of the coins this also presents another concern as those devs can be targeted by states , hackers, or attackers or as we often see with altcoin devs they pump and dump a project and than move onto a competing project to repeat this cycle over and over again thus have an incentive to attack their old project.
With Proof of work , seizing the coins or stake of any individual or group of people doesn't effect the process of mining or securing the network directly at all . They can only try and spook the market by dumping coins at a discount while individuals like myself will happily buy up all the discounted coins.
PoS is being sought because it is a clever marketing ploy to attract environmentalists who are concerned about the electricity used in PoW mining. They may have valid concerns that I also share but they fail to see all the external costs in PoS.
It is akin to not adding up all the inefficiencies in coming to a consensus in a democratic presidential election.

There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

Do you really think these exchanges are banning their paying clients and spending millions of dollars on coinanalysis for nothing? 
They understand that even if the regulations don't explicitly say how they must comply that when the NSA, FBI, DEA, or LEO make a request they better comply or repercussions will occur. Without coinanalysis they will not be able to give satisfactory answers to regulators and there will be sever repercussions henceforth

He was the only developer who coded the hard fork that created the altcoin bcash  as he was paid by Bitmain to do so. This is what miners and users used to created the altcoin. 


This is not true at all. There was no proof of burn or trade in of BTC for BCH on a sidechain. All BTC holders literally where given a BCH altcoin airdrop when the hardfork copied the BTC UTXO set just like with all these other altcoins that airdropped their coin - 
Perhaps you mean to make a distinction between a airdrop that is centrally distributed and one where the user splits their coins? If so please do not ignore the few UTXO split altcoins that preceded bcash

Coinbase and Gemini have been closing accounts retroactively for some time now by coinanaltics tracing txs onchain more than 2 hops later. They do this because they have to show active enforcement.(It isn't profitable banning your clients normally) Monero would prevent them from doing this and bring fines and likely force them to shut down their exchange as they would no longer be able to do coinanalytics after the first hop. KYC cannot help with this.
There is a reason Bitcoin is still the most used currency on the DNM despite privacy coins existing. Bitcoin is private enough and liquidity and stability is more important . Now I am not satisfied with onchain fungibility and Schnorr/MAST/Dandelion is needed , but hard forking in ring signatures which will destroy bitcoins scalibility and cause regulators to freak out causing a liquidity crunch which is not the best tactical approach

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

Many exchanges don't list Bitconnect so they left it as BCC on many exchanges including some very large ones like Binance even to this day. I have no idea what Bitmain/VIABTC was thinking being that Bitconnect was overtly a scam and at the time ~ in marketcap at the time which is pretty hard to miss.

You are correct sir about other devs contributing to this altcoin, He was merely the main developer to create Bcash. This is why I originally said that amaury's comment was only partly true. 


Bcash literally doubled the amount of tokens out there and awarded them to all BTC users. That is exactly what an airdrop entails. The combined market cap of both coins was higher before and after the flag day Hard fork as well also reinforcing this was a new airdrop created

Exactly. Blocks are needed because of the latency added in the Poisson Distribution curve as a consequence of Proof of work
Proof of Stake is not new or very interesting, and exists as a form with fiat currency already.
Proof of stake has many more attack vectors(nothing at stake attacks, long range attacks, short range attacks , stake grinding attacks) than proof of work and ultimately is either less efficient or less secure.
Further reading -
There doesn't seem to be any foreseeable solutions to making proof of stake secure either besides obscuring the flaws. Bitcoin is deliberately made inefficient with proof of work as using provable work that is external to the blockchain is the only means to create real costs where the game theory supports a model where it is both profitable to secure BTC and extremely costly to attack it.
With PoW (proof of work) you would need to be a tremendous amount of effort in order to censor 1-2 blocks with building many asic mining farms, and than burning the electricity continuously in order to attack bitcoin.
With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before) to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff such an attack because it involves outside resources.

Since its the early adoption stage than it may very well be a smarter strategy to focus more on investing directly in Bitcoin but one should also diversify their investments.
Say your take home is a modest 8k a month and like many companies they match your investment into the 401k where you decide to invest 5% per paycheck or 400 USD a month 
400x2(match) = 800 USD a month(9600 yr) with 80% stock returning 10% and 20% BAKKT returning 300% a year = 9600 +6528=16,128 USD after a year
**Skip the 401k and spend the 400 on BTC**
400x12=4800  returns =4800principle + 19,200 = 24,000
Thus you can see you will be better off investing in BTC assuming a bullish outcome but you won't get the tax benefits from the 401k and it will be a much riskier investment . Best strategy is to hedge your bets and invest both in the 401k with a % in BAKKT and buy BTC directly to have a balanced portfolio

Right now the block reward or inflation is at around 3.89% or 12.5 BTC every 10 min on average or 1800 new BTC mined a day worldwide. 
In mid 2020 this amount is cut in half dropping inflation down to 1.79% or a mere 900 BTC daily . As a point of comparison the USD has around 2-3% inflation a year and most other fiat currencies much worse. 
This means that there might be a bull market because of an ETF or BAKKT before 2020, but if not than its likely there will be one after inflation drops due to increased scarcity

3) While it is true that LN and sidechains will handle many of the txs in the future and absorb some of the tx fees, the main blockchain will still rise correspondingly because every other chain will be dependent upon it due to the security of having most of the hashing power.

Here is the detailed math on how 100TWh was calculated .
As you can see it doesn't include the other overhead I suggested, merely raw electrical use at the branches and atms. Granted to be fair we are comparing apples to oranges here because fiat currency serves far more clients and we need to also consider the human overhead to secure Bitcoin as well. L2 capacity doesn't increase PoW overhead at the same rate though so we have yet to see how well BTC can scale.
All I am saying is that fiat currency is extremely wasteful and is ultimately secured by the extremely wasteful and environmentally hazardous military. As Bitcoin grows in marketshare security of mining farms will also need to increase but this would also be offset by individual miners competing without such security overhead keeping these costs reasonable unlike fiat.
Thus the bottom line is this topic is far more complex than any study has conducted and we cannot make assumptions without looking in further detail

Than this merely reinforces how secure PoW is . Despite segwit2x and despite Bitmains intentions miners still secure BTC instead of directly attack it due to the incentives in BTC. 


Than you don't quite understand the security assumptions in Bitcoin. 100% of hashpower could enforce rule changes and my nodes will simply ban and ignore them and not peer their blocks automatically as an immune reaction. 


This rests upon the false assumption that the "total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin."

This is the distinction between us , you are merely focused on a slightly better return by gambling with altcoins and aren't focusing all your efforts into Bitcoin to insure it is a success. This is also why many of these altcoins will come and go as we have seen historically. Your ideals are more focused on short term gains , while ours are more ideologically committed to this project.

Only for those that don't become more efficient, reduce, reuse, or adopt renewable energy. You see, Bitcoin is incentivizing people to become better and pollute less. 


The cost of ASICs to produce is much less than what consumers pay and most mining is done by the manufacturers and their partners. As time goes on and commoditization of ASICs occur the cost of ASICs will keep dropping and previous generations will take much longer before becoming obsolete(Therefore there is no longer a rush to mine 100% during the first 3 months for consumers). Thus most of the costs has to do with electricity and this will only become more pronounced with each year

Most of the development happens in Bitcoin and many altcoins regularly continue to copy this work. 


Anyone can submit a pull request. There are many implementations in BTC to choose from and if you are asking about who decides to merge code in the 1 implementation called "core" than the simple answer is it is a consensus process where any regular contributor can veto or "NACK" a pull request and this will likely delay or stop it from being merged

Here is the detailed math on how 100TWh was calculated . 
As you can see it doesn't include the other overhead I suggested, merely raw electrical use at the branches and atms. Granted to be fair we are comparing apples to oranges here because fiat currency serves far more clients and we need to also consider the human overhead to secure Bitcoin as well. L2 capacity doesn't increase PoW overhead at the same rate though so we have yet to see how well BTC can scale. 
All I am saying is that fiat currency is extremely wasteful and is ultimately secured by the extremely wasteful and environmentally hazardous military. As Bitcoin grows in marketshare security of mining farms will also need to increase but this would also be offset by individual miners competing without such security overhead keeping these costs reasonable unlike fiat. 
Thus the bottom line is this topic is far more complex than any study has conducted and we cannot make assumptions without looking in further detail

The limit was raised to 4MB of weight last year . 
Here are the concerns with too large of a blocksize \- 
The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:
1\) Block propagation latency \(causing centralization of mining\)
2\) UTXO bloat \(increases CPU and more RAM costs\)
3\) Bandwidth costs [
4\) IBD \(Initial Block Download \) Boostrapping new node costs 
5\) Blockchain storage \(largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner\)
This means we need to scale conservatively and intelligently. We must scale with every means necessary. Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains must be used. 
Bitcoin has gone from a network 7 transactions per second and confirmations taking between a second to hours \(10 min avg Poisson distribution curve\) to \~14 TPS onchain and millions of TPS with instant and secure confirmations with LN channels.

play stupid games daytrading shitcoins , win stupid prizes.
Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading \-
Day traders find that they become obsessed with checking the price and end up spending most of their productive time looking at charts instead of working for a salary.
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying

Perhaps, but I am much more conservative and despite being an Agorist who hates using FIAT , I also recognize the importance that liquidity and stability has in a currency and Bitcoin will remain far less liquid and far more volatile for many years to come. 


I see no evidence of this. Merely virtue signalling the word "blockchain" for marketing reasons , scams, or to encourage investment. The cryptocurrency ecosystem is still an insignificant economic participant in the world economy. To those that understand the trend this is good news as it means we are still nascent and the upside potential is great

Multiple competing "smart contract" altcoins are beginning to eat away marketshare from Ethereum; principally Cardono and EOS with EOS being a large ETH stakeholder being that it was a parasitic ICO off of Ethereum and its creators are antagonistic to Ethereum thus have a lot of ETH to dump remaining... estimates are around 100k eth left with EOS alone and that is merely one of thousands of ICOs

You merely have IOU's because those btc can be seized, lost or stolen at any second. 
Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with \~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit

The reason financial planners recommend one to diversify their assets is to hedge with different **safe** assets , especially assets that have **low or no correlation**. Cryptocurrencies in general are highly correlated and since 99% of altcoins are scams , diversifying ones investments in cryptocurrency is worse than having a portfolio of diversified penny stocks. Additionally, one of the principle raison d'être of Bitcoin is to create digital scarcity, being a multicoiner undermines this are re-introduces hyperinflation and undermines your principle investment in Bitcoin.

fee pressure is good because it encourages batching , use of segwit , and driving more txs to L2 solutions like the LN . Satoshi invented payment channels but work languished on this until blocks started to become full and fees increased. Exchanges like coinbase initially were doing 2 onchain txs for every withdrawal , and now fee pressure has finally encouraged them to stop externalizing all these costs on users and full nodes and they now batch txs and use segwit. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:05:42
Miner is rewarded 12.5 BTC \+ 1\-3 BTC in fees in coinbase block reward , they than transfer this BTC to exchange with an onchain btc tx . They can either use this tx to directly load the BTC into a LN channel or tx some in LN and leave some with a regular address \(yes this can be done with a single onchain tx\) or allow the exchange to load the 13.5\-15.5 BTC into a channel.
Either way :
1\) There will always be demand for onchain txs even though most txs will happen offchain or other L2
2\) The end user doesn't even need to worry about really high onchain tx fees in the future . For now they are a mere few pennies , but lets assume btc gets really busy  a couple years into the future and the fee market creates 10 dollar fees onchain as a hypothetical. That fee will be covered across the whole \~14 BTC the miner loads to a LN channel , thus a user buying 0.1 BTC from an exchange would have a fee of 1/140 of 10 USD or 7 US pennies for that purchase

Very valuable information is gained by seeing which wallet development teams are incompetent or have their priorities off. The fact that wallets like bread and mycelium still lack segwit reflects that we should avoid them at all costs.

If you have a technical understanding of these altcoin projects one can quickly understand which ones are scams(not all of them are) and know for a fact that they have no efficiency and will eventually capitulate in value. They are simply supported by dumb money and speculation and this dumb money will jump over to the newest project as we have seen time and time again. 
I don't disagree you can make greater returns by getting lucky and investing in the right altcoin at the right time and than exiting at the right time as well but this is merely speculative trading and certainly has significant risks and costs
Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
	
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading 
Day traders find that they become obsessed with checking the price and end up spending most of their productive time looking at charts instead of working for a salary.
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying


One can just evaluate the incentives , economics, and technology and make the best decision

One of the most important aspects of cryptocurrency is the creation of digital scarcity and sound money. This is explained in satoshi's comments , the design of btc, the code, and the message in the genesis block.  Being a multicoiner throws this all outside the window.

Even if BCC HF in a solution for transaction malleability they have three problems using and adopting LN scaling solutions
1\) The whole ethos of bcash is to always have low onchain tx fees  regardless of other scaling solutions and to keep HF blocksize increases  to insure this happens therefore there will never be any motivation to  do the hardwork of building LN on BCC
2\) Because many of the LN solutions are dependent upon aspects like  segwit , RBF and the codebase keeps diverging between BTC and BCC it  will become increasingly more difficult to copy the work from LN  implementations without creating bugs
3\) One key aspect of LN securely is users being able to run their own  full nodes or watch towers which will become very hard to do if Bcash  keeps increasing their blocksize limit

There is always a spectrum of safety and it is relative to the value of forked coins I am splitting. First of all make sure you transfer your btc to a new wallet with different private keys so your btc are never at risk. IMHO if I was dealing with claiming an extremely small amount of split coins value like under 10k usd worth I would feel comfortable claiming them in a VM instance I create or even in an android or ios device . For larger sums I would suggest going through the effort of doing so in a clean environment like fresh OS install or live OS instance

They are , and why people complain when their monero gets "stolen" from them on a regular basis. Please read their TOS- 


DEXs have existed for sometime like BISQ , the trouble always lies with the fiat onramps and offramps like always. Submarine swaps are great , will make LN more private , and make exchanges less costly and more secure -   but still do not solve the fiat problem . Privacy coins may also become obsolete with a BTC sidechain(Example , liquid sidechain already has CT and more sidechains will have other solutions) as well so submarine swaps don't necessarily help them. 


I hope this is true , but am far too pessimistic as I have seen time and time again people will forego privacy and security for UX. IMHO The better approach would be to make privacy easier to use so at least we get a higher % of people taking advantage of it.

Agorists often have a more nuanced view of fiat currency . They understand the network effect leads to many benefits of fiat currency that are useful and efficient over barter or less stable currencies but also recognize much harm done by the corrupt that control the currency.
Fiat currency is here to stay in the short term \(at least for the next 100 years\) and we need to understand that it isn't innately evil but merely a stepping stone in our understanding of economics and currency

What Luke likely means to suggest when **successful** HFs cannot occur without ~100% of users is that there is an extremely high probability in bitcoin that both coins will survive after the HF splitting the community and this is why its not **successful**. Thus success has a very specific definition. 
Of course in reality 1 person or a small group can HF whenever they want and they can do so with success but than since the original chain survives that would generally be considered the true bitcoin 
and the new fork is an alt-coin by definition.
I would argue with Luke that a successful HF may indeed occur with less than 100% , perhaps 99.9%  of users if all the exchanges refuse to list the original coin on the exchange and the remaining set of users quickly lose interest, but this is up for debate

Many are so invested into the narrative of big blocks and BU provides them a permanent solution by handing over this decision to the miners that they are in denial. 
Others really don't support BU and thus you see other implementations like Classic and XT persisting. 
Others still don't want any of the above and simply want to use BU as a negotiation tool for a second compromise. 
Some miners are using BU to profit off the ideological motivations of a small group by selling them cloud mining contract scams and ICO scams. 
Others are using BU to troll and create division in the community. 
There are many motivations.

If you don't control your private keys you don't own your bitcoin
If you don't personally control your hash power you cannot guarantee your vote or a ROI.
100% of cloudmining should be avoided because few make ROI, if any, and it weakens the security model of bitcoin by further centralize mining. Many of these operations fractionally reserve mine and are set up as ponzis as well so you also cannot guarantee your money is buying any hashpower at all. 
Read this for more information - 
Keep in mind that those not considered a ponzi or fraud will likely become one in the future in this list.

2) Buy and control your own ASICs

Almost 2 years of testing segwit on various testnets is helpful , but testing it on a high value coin like litecoin would be even more helpful.

That isn't how it works. The flaw you are making is "the repository" , there is no "the repository" but many repository's.
Every dev can commit code to their repository, and than a dev can make pull requests to one of many repositories. 
What code gets merged and what doesn't is a matter of consensus. 
If you don't like your fellow devs opinions because they keep disagreeing with you than you are free to create your own repository where you have commit access or are your own maintainer. 
Nothing is stopping open development where anybody can modify the code in any way and than propose it to the community.

฿tcDrak and a few other core devs are also mostly anonymous. Might be a good idea for one of the Core Maintainers to be anonymous as well (at least to others besides the maintainers themselves ).

You misunderstand. I am not suggesting either fork will change the limit, I am suggesting that the moment a HF "fails" and 2 coins survive than everyone has twice as many coins (instant Hyperinflation) . Thus there will be ~32 m coins instead of ~16 m and a combined limit of 42m.

I don't agree with this as a simple sustained 51% attack would/could invalidate many of the rules which define a block.  Ultimately its the economic majority of users that define bitcoin , and if a PoW change is needed in the future due to the advent of corrupt miners or quantum computers than so be it. There are many more important aspects that define bitcoin vs merely the 21 million schedule and most proof of work chain that Gavin is ignoring. By his definition a cabal of miners could institute blacklists and it would still be considered bitcoin.

Withholding segwit won't stop us improving and building Bitcoin. We are patient and can maintain the status quo with the base protocol and merely build out layers that work on layer 0.

Segwit will be adopted in time , and the status quo , while not ideal isn't the end of the world either. We see the fee market working as intended and while some lower fee payments get delayed , mine always get through on the next block with the right fee.

Perhaps , but we should still try. Perhaps a Sidechain where we merge mine both chains for backwards compatibility could work on an upgrade. This would also preserve the 21 million limit unlike a "failed" HF.


I don't insist on anything. Users should be free to HF whenever they want. All it takes is 1 person to fork off the network. I am just discussing the reality and consequences of HF's, If 0 to +1% of economic users (not sybil accounts) decide to stay on the original chain or not participate in a HF than exchanges will very likely add their coin to profit off the trading fees. ETH saw massive volume , but is won't be anything like the volume we will see in speculation trading within bitcoin which has a far greater userbase.

Both coins would free float in value on exchanges and not maintain or ever see the weight you assign. Initially ETH/ETC was worth slightly more combined than prefork, than dropped to less. This would leave a stain on bitcoins store of value and immutability and could lead to market confusion where some users lose all their value when they attempt to guess what chain the economic majority will favor. Than what will happen, Certain shops accept Bitcoin A , Others Bitcoin B , and other Bitcoin A and B ? With Ethereum there was no use cases and it was still 100% speculative and never intended to be cash. Bitcoin is p2pcash/gold with a circular economy of realworld use cases so is much different than ETH.

Segwit is a long term solution to many problems but not capacity and never has been marketed as a permanent solution for capacity.


I'm not opposed to further increasing the blocksize if need be beyond segwit but this statement isn't exactly correct either. 
There are many solutions from LN , sidechains, rootstock, lumnos , sprites that all may be useful to properly scale bitcoin in the future. most recent - 
I won't pretend to know which will prevail or multiple solutions will be used , but we should add the large capacity increase segwit provides , implement MAST/Schnorr sigs for more tx throughput, and than see how these technologies emerge and access from there.

If there is no block reward or sufficient tx fees to incentivize PoW than a crucial part of the security model breaks down.


From Their FAQ- 


Yes, but it is far worse than what you imply. The whole world is in the USA jurisdiction if one single IOTA is sold to a US client or one single IOTA tx is sent to a server located in the US. I'm not suggesting this is ethically right or fair , but just reality as practiced. Whether IOTA is fined , shutdown , sued, or people go to jail has more to do with how successful IOTA is in scamming people. If IOTA becomes popular , expect regulators to come. If IOTA never becomes popular but breaks a clearcut violation that is easily legislated expect the law, If IOTA ever steps on the wrong toes , expect consequences from the state.

It is entertaining so worth a watch but...
Ethereum(at minimum premine) and ICO's are securities, and a generally illegal because they didn't file the right paperwork.
There is a distinction between being in the business to sell something like a product or service or subscription and selling securities. 
Securities are defined primarily by applying the Howey test -- simply put is there a solicitation of money that will be in control by a third party where the buyer has an expectation of profit. 
Ethereum cannot hide behind the "donation" fine print with their premine token sale.
Bitcoin is not a security(because its mined and not controlled by anyone).
Just because regulators haven't started making arrests right now doesn't mean they won't in the future. They will tend to gather evidence(DAO) and build a solid case before sending the first cease and desist order. They don't want to set a bad precedent and want to win the case.
Hiding in another country won't protect you from regulation. If one of your clients or investors is located in the US , than US jurisdiction applies , If none than other countries regulations apply. 
Developer kickbacks as seen in zcash might fall under franchise law.
**IF an organizer or group/company decides to push for a Bitcoin HF and solicits investments with the promise of returns in the value of Bitcoin going up in the future than they could be sued under the idea that they would be manipulating the underlying asset where the original investors may lose value.**

Thanks for a reasonable discussion. Whether we get there with a 2MB HF or Segwit doesn't matter much to me, but I do believe Segwit is superior . I wouldn't actually have a problem with classic if it had a higher threshold and didn't pile on dangerous things like headers first spv mining features, but we should be prepared for a HF if there are problems with segwit and I'm sure the community could rally behind a HF maxBlockSize increase if there was indeed some problems.  Classic supporters are shooting themselves in the foot if they try and block a capacity increase.

Core is not in charge , and a group of devs from various backgrounds opinion on the matter is completely besides the point of this topic. If we need capacity improvements we should be open them, regardless of politics or who is proposing it. A segwit softfork does not prevent a 2MB maxBloxSize HF.

A few concerns with this token -


2) You think Bitcoin has scaling problems , Ethereum's blocksize is already over 10GB and no one is using it. Even if they "sharded up" and pruned the blocksize they are going to have much larger problems because there currency isn't a currency but fuel for cpu cycles, thus a popular DAPP would both drive up the cost of cpu cycles and clog the network
3) 12 sec blocktimes is absurdly small and leads to too many orphans or forks. This is why Monero devs are increasing from 1 minute block times to 2 or more
4) Lack of practical use case of any Dapps , mainly a novelty right now. 
5) Once ethereum switches to PoS, there will be strong incentives to simply fork the coin to either create a sidechain or clone with the same properties but better security because the fuel distribution can be bootstrapped like clams as proposed by æthereum. Losing PoW will remove any advantage ethereum has over other ethereum forks/clones. Why would anyone want to pay for ethereum fuel when they are given free æthereum DAPP fuel and than subsequent fuel purchases are both more secure and less expensive?

Your sense is incorrect , otherwise Classic would have gained consensus quickly. The only reason a small blocksize increase is intresting with segwit is because it is a softfork and includes many other improvements. 
An increase in capacity itself for a HF isn't something I'm interested in unless it includes aspects that improve scalability, take into consideration costs, and include other hf wishlist items.

3) Do not keep bitcoins on exchanges. Only use trusted ones to onramp and offramp
4) Do not invest everything into bitcoin, keep some fiat handy so you are never forced to sell at a loss if an unexpected expense comes up. Use purse.io to save 15-20% off of amazon(but never buy digital items or giftcards on purse.io)

NACK, Controversially low 75% activation threshold , and lack of supporting data and tests, and little to no concern of externalized costs miners can impose upon full nodes with exponentially increasing block sizes.

A fee market still needs to compete with both free off chain txs and if on the chain txs rise too high most dust txs will drop off freeing up space. Whether we increase the block size or not, bitcoin will be fine. There are indeed tradeoffs with each but tx will go through.
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:54:23


4-8MB blocks are too large now, perhaps in the future they will be fine based upon the evidence. 
Thus a compromise HF proposal where we agree to it for political reasons instead of what is safe for bitcoin sets a very dangerous precedent where we open up new attack vectors by placing either miners or developers in charge, at the cost of decentralization , and them being corrupted or placed in duress by attackers. Thus we need to insure the community of economic users maintains control with HF decisions.

First of all , I am not against all HFs ... secondly there is a distinct difference between being for a HF to protect against miners attacking a minority chain , a HF fixing a fundamental bug in bitcoin  like 2013 , and a HF which doesn't have a big payoff and makes us all more insecure.

Gives a good breakdown of bandwidth averages per city, country, or ISP. 


I don't mind cores UI , but we must empathize with that fact that most users prefer easier to use and better looking UI found in other wallets. Just because both of us have acclimated to the look and feel of core over the years doesn't mean a newer user is going to like it vs other wallets UI now. We have to empathize with these users. 


If they want to be an archival node or not leach off others than yes, they need better bandwidth. I would like to see many more full archival nodes and many more users simply validating their txs on pruned nodes as well. I think that a better looking wallet and some unique features might increase node count, but yes we need to be conservative with scaling too as segwit is really pushing the limit IMHO.

There will guarantee be a split where 2-3 coins exist for one thing which will cause short term havoc due to uncertainty, loss of immutability , breaking the 21 million limit promise, moral hazard , social hazard, ect...(Remember Bitcoin is actually used for things unlike Ethereum which is 100% speculation, thus a split is far more damaging to bitcoin)  
The ETF follows the most worked chain only, thus if the miners are swayed back to the originally chain after many of us dump our split coins all those ETF investors lose their investment value. 
4-8MB blocks will lead to centralization, increase miner and node centralization and force me to shutdown my personal node. 
There are several academic studies that show that after the network can safely handle up to 4 MB with certain concerns researched(Which one reason segwit allows up to 4MB blocks and not 8MB as the above proposes)
BU supporters have every right to promote and fork the chain, and I encourage them to do so if they are doing it for principled reasons, but this doesn't mean it will be good for bitcoin and doesn't mean I will follow their unwise path.

After splitting my coins safely with the help of some BTU , the strategy would be to set multiple sell limit orders on exchanges just below the current hashlimit on the BU fork. 
This means that If BU fork activates at 75% I will keep selling BTU at market price until the price of BTU altcoin is slightly less than 1/4 the real bitcoin price and all during this time immediately buy back Bitcoin with fiat and the BTU trades. 
As miners begin to move back slowly , I will raise my sell limits on BTU till it matches just below the hash rate ratio, Thus at 60% BUfork  / 40 % Original I would set my target sell  price to slightly less than 1/3rd bitcoins value.

Each individual person can be that authority . There is no central authority , which is why anyone can hard fork at any time for any reason without anyone's permission in bitcoin. 


Not all , Satoshi made plenty of upgrades without BIP9 or hashrate vote , and Gavin did a flag update with BIP 16 as well. Using hashrate to signal an upgrade is just an indirect means of determining consensus and a safe UASF would be better if we can figure out all the details.

Soft forks  and hard forks  are completely different animals with different means of activation and different risk factors. They absolutely cannot be "bundled together". 
What you are likely suggesting is lets forget about a Segwit SF, and do a segwit Hard fork with MAX_BLOCK_SIZE increase to 2MB. 
problem with this is that 
1) There would need to be 6-8 more months(minimum) in testing with any newly created HF proposal 
2) Many in the community would reject such a HF proposal because the risks aren't worth the benefits and 4-8MB blocks are too large for now so the HF would never gain consensus.
Personally, I would never go along with a HF chain unless it offered a permanent scaling solution that addressed security and cost concerns (BU fails miserably here ) and included many HF wishlist items. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 04:18:17
Perhaps you are right about micro txs being a potential usecase.. But bitcoin isn't exactly suitable for micro txs now with the real costs of txs being 7-10USD per tx... we need payment channels to roll out first for those to be useful, and having Open Bazaar throw all those micro tx on the main net would be disastrous. Thus I think its a good thing that Bitcoin is avoiding facilitating that use case and instead preparing to scale as a settlement network to allow for microtxs to be properly handled in the future. Any alt that is adopted by openbazaar and becomes popular will have the same problem. The reality we must admit to ourselves in blockchain technology is horribly inefficient and needs to be treated as a settlement network in order to scale.

Almost every core dev is strongly suggesting we increase the blocksize with segwit which will eventually grow the average blocksize to 1.7MB to 2.1MB averages.

I can help find someone to do a public audit and think it can be done quite quickly. I think the stumbling block is there is some ethical or legal restriction from having an open audit where financial details are opened to the public(I'm not suggesting internal memos and notes need to be disclosed)? If the audit cannot be done in a public manner than I agree  with your original premise that it is a waste of time.

Segwit will increase the blocksize to over 2MB in time. 
These studies reflect an analysis of certain concerns with scalability , there is more evidence outside them that even 2MB has certain risk factors and it in itself will lead to further centralization and security risks. This is one reason why segwit allows up to 4MB blocks and not higher.

There won't be a delayed flag date set until consensus is met , thus there would be no UASF unless almost all businesses wanted segwit. 


No, segwit is backwards compatible, even in the event anonymous users who do not object openly to the UASF , they still can carry on using bitcoin like normal and completely ignore segwit txs , blocks , and fully validate all non segwit txs even the signatures as well. Miners can also choose to not upgrade their mining nodes  as long as they run a border node. 


First , consensus in the community must be found , and its likely that miners will activate with BIP 9 with this trend but lets assume they don't:
If the miners do not choose to either upgrade to either a segwit node or use a segwit border node sometime within the 6-12 month window , than they will be forked off the network. 
Keep in mind that this essentailly means the miners are not mining the chain that the almost complete community supports so if a large percentage of miners don't follow consensus of the users than we have a much bigger problem at hand because they are antagonistic to the community and we will need to perform a PoW hardfork to likely PoW SHAW256/PoS or PoW SHAW256/PoW Keccak

LN is working hard on testing and working all the time. 


I assume you mean why don't they pivot and redesign LN without tx malleability fixed? Reason - This would undo a lot of their work and efforts and we will eventually see segwit adopted one way or another whether it is UASF or the BU forks off and we immediately get strong support for segwit. I know many are impatient with segwit , but even the opponents of core tend to think it is great code and are merely blocking it as a negotiation tactic. It is 100% clear that BU isn't a viable option otherwise we would see Jihan and other pools use their code(It is highly likely that ViaBTC is false signalling and running core still) , Jihan and other businesses aren't coming out and supporting segwit because they are waiting to see how the community comes together around segwit -- 
Thus , once we see 
1) 95%+ of wallets on this list adopt segwit and support it - 
2) 95% of major exchanges upgrade and support segwit 
3) 80-90% of full nodes supporting segwit - 
Right now we have 68% nodes signalling segwit 
and 91% signalling core
4) 95%+ of devs supporting segwit - already done 
We will see strong pressure for remaining miners to signal segwit. This is how it should be, miners should withhold the vote if they dont see strong support in the community.

We should pursue a safe UASF process regardless of the miners activating segwit or not because using miners to activate upgrades has always been an indirect and rough means of determining consensus within bitcoin and it would be far better allowing the economic users directly determine upgrades to the network.
This being said, there are still many problems that need to be resolved first with UASF.
Additionally, we should also pursue a well tested and PoW HF as another backup option. 
The mere threat of these may keep the miners honest but only if we are honest and prepared to use them. "Speak softly but carry a big stick"

This is a dangerous precedent giving control to miners or developers without community consensus. Hard forks should be a matter of last resort and when a SF is on the table that offers the same essential blocksize increase as classic we should be greatful and take it instead. 
There is significant moral hazard and social hazard in forcing a HF on the community and how that will make us all insecure in the future. If the Developers or miners are viewed as a group that is perceived they can change the protocol without overwhelming consensus of the bitcoin users than they can easily be manipulated and attacked by bad actors like states and others.

Perhaps you haven't thought this through. Core supporters have no problems with temporary delays in confirmation times and will use this to their advantage.  
 A really neat aspect to this is the minority hash chain would have several advantages in this trading. First advantage is the original coin would have 25% or less hashpower therefore it will be easier to transfer the BUforkcoin to an exchange. BU supporters wanting to dump their original btc on exchanges will have to wait for seriously delayed confirmations while the original chain supporters will be able to get quicker confirmations to quickly devastate the price of BUforkcoin. BU miners will lose a lot of money here. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:43:51


This question doesn't make sense because core isn't a monolithic entity and UASF is still a work in progress , and it wasn't a core dev that proposed UASF. 


There are many aspects to a node verifying txs outside signatures. Old notes will be able to verify the long list of what is valid even for segwit txs without upgrading , just not signatures , and if they don't want to upgrade they can simply ignore segwit txs and only accept regular txs if they really want to verify ~20 aspects of a tx and not merely ~19 aspects of a tx. There is also no risk for old nodes if they receive a segwit tx and not verify signatures because it won't even appear in their wallet until 1 confirmation.


Of course you can ignore it or block segwit txs. 


Speaking to the people themselves and allowing anyone in public to come forward and bring up concerns. The internet is a big place and exists outside of theymos's properties.

@_date: 2017-03-07 21:05:45


First of all , seeking a compromise with a group of individuals who won't consider a compromise because they want control Bitcoin and to fire all of core is foolish task. Thus even if I agreed to 2MB + segwit this would not stop BU supporters from their attacks on Bitcoin. 
I am perfectly fine considering future HF proposals. One that suggests 4-8MB right now is technically irresponsible so will I will definitely not run that software. I am also completely against politically motivated HF's that do not reach consensus. We should adopt what is technically best for bitcoin and not what is easy but insecure. 
This also doesn't address the moral hazard and social hazard in forcing a HF on the community and how that will make us all insecure in the future.

If segwit dowenst get activated in a couple years , we can always change the total weight to 6 or 8 million units with devs doing 6 months of testing and we find it safe which would make the blocksize between 3-6MB for 6 million units of weight or 6 to 8MB for 8 million units of weight. 
It isn't wise to do  this now because it isn't safe for the network , but would avoid the need for a HF altogether. The best solution is just to activate segwit as is , than work more on Schnorr sigs , MAST , LN , ect...

Why not simply say "most worked" to avoid confusion because at one time longest chain literally meant longest chain?


Yes, I never indicated the two are related , but both are what defines bitcoin. This isn't merely my opinion but a simple fact as to how the bitcoin network runs . If BU forks with 99% hashpower and has far more accumulated work than the minority chain over 92% of all nodes will instantly consider it a malicious altcoin, ignore their blocks , and ban any peer nodes that are relaying BTU . This is just a simple fact of how bitcoin actually works in reality ... thus Bitcoin is the most worked **Valid** chain and economic nodes determine what is valid!
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:26:59
Depends on your definition of Bitcoin. If your definition rests on bitcoin always following the most worked chain than yes, bitcoin would be broken.

What's the difference from the decentralization point of view? 
There are differences.
Allowing L2 to more quickly develop will take a lot of tx pressure off of 2MB segwit blocks vs 2MB classic blocks without tx malleability fixed. 
Shnorr and MAST benefit from segwit allowing further scaling without any negative effects of decentralization. 
Segwit balances UTXO growth and fixes bitcoin to have Linear scaling of sighash operations making 2Mb with segwit much safer in terms of decentralization than 2MB with MAX_BLOCK_SIZE variable change

Yes, it is clear that we have very different viewpoints of Bitcoin as simply following the most worked chain would easily allow manipulation from outside actors and we would need to call all sorts of future variations "Bitcoin" regardless how different they are to what we have been working towards and signed up for. 
To me "Bitcoin" is the most worked **valid** chain with emphasis on valid. We cannot assume that the most worked blockchain will always be valid to everyone and that isn't how bitcoin was designed or how it works in practice regardless. Economic nodes don't simply follow the most work, they reject invalid blocks and ban peers that relay them like they are a hostile virus as a matter of fact. 


You are not picking up my nuanced position. I absolutely support the free market, absolutely support an individual or group Hard Forking bitcoin at any time, I am actually actively suggesting BU supporters go ahead and follow through with their principles and realize their hard fork. 
All I am asking for is a bit of honesty for the new users so they understand the pros and cons of hard forks. This isn't fear mongering but an accurate reflection on the risks and benefits-- BU HF off will allow us to watch them experiment with their project, It will honor their sovereignty and make them happy instead of complaining on reddit, will likely make some people wealthy in the chaos that ensues, ect...

Never rent hashrate, it weakens bitcoin security by centralizing mining and you will likely get scammed by these cloud mining companies. I appreciate your intentions , but only mine when you physically control the equipment yourself. If you want to support Segwit and core the easy way than - 
1) Run a core full node and use it to make economic txs
2) Correct any inaccurate statements on the internet and in person you hear concerning segwit - 
3) Continue buying and holding bitcoin offline- best a HW wallet(for savings) and if a BU fork occurs than there will be instructions for you to split your coins to dump your forked coins on an exchanges. A good reason a HF hasn't happened is the price keeps rising , therefore we all must keep buying bitcoin to keep bitcoin headed in the right direction so segwit eventually gets adopted.
4) Contribute to documentation , translations , or help fund development or UASF research- 
Core is open source and anyone can contribute.

With hard forks , the original contract is destroyed and rules changed. The sheep will be forced off the network and what they invested in will no longer apply. Sure , the sheep can take no action in such a scenario but will be left with nothing. Not listening to the sheep and not allowing bitcoin to be immutable with backwards compatibility also opens multiple vulnerabilities to the wolves side. Everyone loses. But we must respect those peoples sovereignty that want to fork. Go ahead. Just don't call it consensus , and add bitcoin to the list with all the other democratic currencies. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:19:20


Softlimits were raised after core optimized the codebase, hard limits after 1MB never, but yes, perhaps segwit will be adopted to increase the blocksize. 


This we can agree on , changing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE variable to 2MB, 4 , or 8 as a onetime bump is indeed ridiculous with a HF. It is simply kicking the can down the road and will immediately get filled up with txs. The only HF I would be interested in is one that included many HF wishlist items and solved the scaling issue once and for all in a safe and secure manner otherwise I prefer we just focus on scaling offchain after segwit/MAST/Schnorr sigs.

There are good reasons to sell BTC and buy it at the moment. I am buying because I want to accumulate more BTC to dump BTU if the HF occurs , but I suppose if you kept the fiat in the exchange and simply repurchased original BTC post fork with fiat it would essentially amount to the same effect and be simpler than splitting ones coins with the tradeoff of losing ones stake if a HF doesn't occur.

Raising the softlimits has not directly solved any problems directly but a result of core increasing scaling by optimizing code. This is verifiable true and you can test it yourself by running any old node software before miner softlimits were raised and see how they handle 1MB blocks today. 


This is also not true.

Cost % per tx volume has gone down - 
And there has been multiple moments where USD tx fees have spiked - 
Additionally, we have seen incidents where the blocks were "congested" and full long before this

There is almost no way core will endorse BU because :
1) Core isn't a monolithic entity, but represents a diverse group of developers where consensus will not be found supporting BU because it is fundementally broken by design. 
2) BU proponents have aggressively and repeatedly attacked core devs as a whole and in targeted manners . There is almost 0 chance that many of them will support that project because of this .
3) Many core devs have many bitcoins(as most early adopters have) and can easily fetch high paying programming/network administrator jobs anywhere. Thus are motivated to work on bitcoin for ideological reasons and are more principled thus are unlikely to compromise on bitcoins security.

You are describing consensus here... listening and addressing each others concerns. 
Are you suggesting that core and those rejecting this HF compromise aren't listening to the r/btc community? Look we empathize and understand your arguments and I can write out a long list of detailed reasons for why we should HF and compromise as well(The list I have to the reasons why we shouldn't is much longer).... but there are a couple flaws with this analogy as how it applies to our circumstance. 
1) most users are unaware of the blocksize debate and don't have an opinion and will simply follow the crowd or majority of specialists and oracles (who overwhelming are conservative) 
2) The sheep in this analogy represents the small group of of classic/XT/BU supporters that we have indeed listened to and thus why segwit was adapted to conform to classics doubling the blocksize. It fit what classic supporters were wanting and was safe in regards to what the science recommends. 
4-8MB blocks is not safe now - 
P.S.... yes , I understand that what many want is not the 2MB to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE but a HF under any circumstance to set a precedent that we can force a contentious hard fork through without consensus. Many are not explicitly requesting this but I can read between the lines as to what the motivation is. I and many others will never compromise for these reasons .

Vaporware isn't the right term because it refers to products that don't exist, LN exists right now and is actively working on testnet , anyone can use it on testnet as we speak , it just hasn't been deployed on mainet because we are waiting on segwit.

It has never been about 2MB , Those 4-8MB blocks (far too big for now to start) will quickly get filled in a few months and that there will be demands for another Hard fork that reject consensus like how people are trying to force a HF on a community now.

Yes and No . VPS nodes have a lot of fast bandwidth so in a sense do indeed help new IBD (initial block download ) and peer nodes and we do indeed want a diversity of nodes in all subnets and with all ISPS, so yes a few nodes per VPS is also great but ....
Non economic nodes not used for testnet are essentially a sybil attack that have multiple negative effects from distorting market perception , centralizing nodes within datacenters , allowing un monitored nodes that can become compromised to persist and effect other nodes, ect,..
Economic nodes that are used are by definition excluded from being sybil nodes and it aligns the incentives so the user has a vested interest in patching it and looking out for odd behavior and reporting bugs. Thus it is very important they are economic, if not that is fine if simply used on testnet. 
Thus we should not be spinning up nodes in VPS to "vote" for a proposal like BU supporters are doing.

With the status quo or soft forks the minority can indeed ignore the majority by actively forking off and selling their coins. With a Hard forks , unless the minorities concerns are sufficiently addressed than the minority or sheep has to respond and cannot ignore the "wolves" as one group is attempting to force changes upon the other group. 
This is not the same with soft forks .
Soft forks have always occurred in bitcoin , an intrinsic part of its design, and miners and developers working together to make the rules stricter in no way obligates users to follow those rules. There will be individuals that simply ignore all segwit txs and not accept them and carry on as before with old transactions free from outside coercion. These people will be able to completely validate old transactions as well, just as before , while the rest of the community moves on. No moral hazard, because its backwards compatible.

That is not how development in open source and bitcoin works. Every dev has their own repo , than posts their code and documentation to the mailing list for preliminary review as you can see luke did here - 
If it doesn't get interest or pass preliminary review it will just remain and unless the concerns raised are addressed or significant interest is acquired it will be dead in the water. Merging code comes much later in the development cycle. 
Miners themselves can help address the concerns raised with the HF themselves even and help move it along but they have expressed little interest in any of cores HF proposals.

1) What's the worst that can happen to current holders who do nothing?
As long as you don't use an SPV node, leave your coins on an exchange, or make txs during the HF you will be fine if you wait it out.


If you are unsure what to do than see above. 


The price of both chains is likely to crash if miners pull this stunt , so sellers will be effected. 


The economic majority HF the PoW algo , making the miners equipment mostly worthless or the miners waste a lot of electricity mining an alt that quickly crashes in price before they can sell it. 
 &gt; Can failure of BU benefit holders?
Yes, those BTC holders that safely split their coins and reinvest can make a profit in the longterm but everyone is likely to be hurt short term. 


BU is a dead end that at most will only provide short term success if they are lucky but has no future.

Core is still in Beta. BU has already gotten out of beta according to their release numbering bitcoinUnlimited-1.0.1.1 insinuating its out of BETA. 


No its about the fact that this bug existed for almost a year , was merged only one hour after the commit, with no commit description of what it was, There was one reviewer on that particular pull request:  , and than to make this all worse was patched in the most insecure manner possible which alloed the attacker to take down 2/3rds of all BU nodes ... 
How many levels of fucked up is this? ... and BU supporters are simply brushing it off like nothing happened and this should be normal with a 20Billion dollar network .... which is another level of what is disturbing with this.

Bitcoin core is an open source group of many diverse people with different backgrounds , where anyone can participate and contribute , even you . 


All software projects need to be maintained , and Bitcoin core has slowly been improving the performance and scalability of Bitcoin. The key principles that make bitcoin great don't change however. 


Bitcoins code can and does get altered but in a way that is backwards compatible. I.E.. There are users still running 0.5.4 versions of bitcoin fine. 


Many different developers contribute . 
In 2016 there were 516 different contributors , MIT media LAB and Blockstream fund the most full time developers , but many are also unpaid volunteers. 


All developers can do is write code and propose it , users can than voluntarily upgrade or not, nothing is forced on them , and there are no auto updates.
This means that code that isn't backwards compatible is extremely hard to gain consensus on. 


It exists in the last few versions , but isn't activated yet , until it finds 95% hashrate support which is a very high degree of miner support. 


The code is open source , yes anyone can change the code , but if you break the consensus rules that everyone agrees to than you just created an alt and are no longer bitcoin. 


Bitcoin protocol is extremely secure and stable , been running without an issue in a hostile environment without a problem since 2013 when there was a protocol problem that was corrected in hours with no one losing money. Anything can be hacked or have flaws though.

Luke Jr suggested several HF proposals, I assume you refer to the one where 17.7% a year till 31MB ?  
Keep in mind that he intended a long activation window so the reversal below 1MB hard limit was never to be realized. 
The biggest problem I have with this proposal is :
1) It assumes 17.7 % growth will remain constant , where we are already seeing ISP's place bandwidth softcaps 
2) It doesn't include HF wish list items 
3) It is too soon as I want to see what improvents we can see from segwit, schnorr sigs, MAST, tumblebit, luminus, sidechains, LN, Rootstock, sprites, ect... first before such a HF

If we don't insist that miners work for economic users and developers merely suggest code and don't force HF changes on the community than Bitcoin is headed down a dangerous and insecure path.

Tests typically come later after some interest and problems are resolved when posted on the mailing list. It must be depressing when the miners and users aren't interested in the proposed HF and than a small group of people who continually attack you keep demanding more work on a HF proposal that has no chance of getting consensus because users around them keep suggesting the HF isn't interesting and not worth the effort. 
A HF with most HF wish list items and that permanently solves the scaling problem in a secure manner (unlike BU ) would interest me.

No one really know if a Transaction fee even would be a good thing or bad thing for bitcoin . A longer "stress test" or analysis of a fee market could give us some very valuable data. This may have to be carried out on the livenet because simulating it in testnet accurately is extremely difficult.

not doing that either - 
My Plan is to:
1) keep buying BTC
2) In the event of a BTU HF , split my coins, dump my BTU , reinvest in BTC keeping the price of BTU below the hashrate ratio(75/25 ratio in hashrate= keep BTU below 1/4 btc price as long as possible) to give miners one last opportunity to come back to the economic majority
3) If my assumptions are wrong or outside actors are subsidizing BTU support to attack BTC, than I will go along with a PoW HF - 
I have been in bitcoin long enough and taken enough profits to not worry about my btc investment (have diversified investments anyways) so can think ideologically and have no problem with a poW HF if needed.

The primary reason bitcoin is interesting to me is because it was supposed to be non political money that wasn't controlled by a centralized cartel. BU does exactly this by handing control over to a mining cartel and centralizing bitcoin. The decision is thus simple that I would never use BU , other than split my coins to dump on an exchange.


I believe the economic majority supports core vision of bitcoin, and thus am willing to take this bet. Regardless, I will be fine as my investments are quite diverse- land, index funds, fiat, gold, businesses. Thus I would recommend others to hedge their bets and seriously consider their investment decisions if they are 100% invested in bitcoin alone.... I don't have to hedge though and can do what I believe is right in principle to win the miners back.

Core devs and many users generally aren't opposed to changing the PoW algo and HF under a 51% attack like this. To be fair to the miners not attacking we would likely choose one of our backup plans that included combined mining SHA256/PoS or SHA256/Keccak. I'll happily dust off my old gpus I used to mine bitcoins with.
This would result in 3 coins as I'm sure MP and crew won't agree with core and their supporters. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 01:19:07
They are only in charge insomuch as the miners and economic nodes agree with them. Developers have no power over us or the miners if we disagree with them, we simply choose not to upgrade or use another implementation. Miners do understand some of the trade offs, and it is of no surprise that many miners in china are concerned with block 
propagation times and orphan rates as well. Even if we ignore the concerns that block sizes have upon full nodes and just focus on the miners concerns, smaller miners in china could be vulnerable to an exponentially increasing blocksize (Bitpays proposal) created by larger miners with better bandwidth and lower latency which could be manipulated by these miners stuffing spam on the network and making it more difficult for small mining pools and p2p miners to compete. Additionally , Why is a 2MB HF so critical when segwit gives us 1.8-2MB effectively....and all the other benefits? I'm onboard with a 2MB HF in time , but Segwit seems much better now being that it has many other benefits as well.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:00:40
The BU devs noticed the attack occurring within 30 min of merge because reports and their test nodes were effected. Bitnodes stats wont be as accurate.

No flextrans only attempts to tackle TX malleability , therefore everything else on that list segwit offers that flextrans lacks.


If there is already a well tested (almost 2 years) solution to malleability that is peer reviewed extensively , why are you suggesting other devs waste their time working on a completely other untested version? It makes no sense. 
Perhaps you want core devs to do the work for an under-represented and under qualified team that hates them and personally attacks them on an ongoing basis? Am I understanding you correctly?

Right now we have status quo, perhaps in the future this will change , perhaps not, there are plenty of other ways to work around this if Jihan continues to block activation. 


You seem to be under the impression that many of us simply will follow core if they suggest any HF. This is incorrect, as I carefully analyzed segwit before coming to the decision that it is the best path forward. Thus it isn't up to developers , but the community as a whole. Core devs have suggested many HF proposals thus far , and I wouldn't use any of them and actively reject all of them , not just XT, Classic, BU. This doesn't mean I'm not open to a HF in the future, but it better be really good to get me interested(secure solution that considers externalities and all costs and includes many HF wishlist items), otherwise I prefer SF's because they are backwards compatible and we have securely done many of them in the past.

While I do not support this group , they are indeed insignificant in numbers , My estimate ~100, but many of these individuals are very early investors so not insignificant in economic weight. One of these users Mircea Popescu is rumored to have a fortune of 800,000 bitcoins. I personally believe it is grossly exaggerated but he likely does have at least 100k-300k and would attack any HF with all his wealth-

There is no central committee to carry out your recommendations. Bitcoin is still a currency , asset, speculative instrument , payment rails network , and settlement network , and will continue to be so in the future depending upon the user. It is and can be all these things. When payment channels like the lightning network are developed people can still have the choice to pay higher fees and pay with the traditional on the chain payment method.

A really neat aspect to this is the minority hash chain would have several advantages in this trading. First advantage is the original coin would have 25% or less hashpower therefore it will be easier to transfer the BUforkcoin to an exchange. BU supporters wanting to dump their original btc on exchanges will have to wait for seriously delayed confirmations while the original chain supporters will be able to get quicker confirmations to quickly devastate the price of BUforkcoin. BU miners will lose a lot of money here.

No , as segwit + MAX_BLOCK_SIZE 2MB = 4-8MB blocks. 


Of course I am including the witness data , that is literally part of the block and we are talking about blocksizes not single variables. You aren't trying to purposely mislead others by ignoring part of each block are you?


My larger concern is giving miners control over the validation rules instead of economic users. This is a radical shift in Bitcoin security model and opens us up to a wide attack surface - 


I also don't want developers to assume the role that they can force changes for assumed or anticipated events (we have no idea if 4-8MB will be safe in even 2-3years) upon the users. This sets a very dangerous precedent.

With segwit this problem may be exacerbated though as 1.7-2.1MB blocks will really start to strain my bandwidth. (but I will sill be able to run a full node with my pathetic 2.5-3Mbps down and 0.5 - 0.7Mbps up)

1 person can decide and has the right to fork, this wouldn't be consensus. 


No, Consensus isn't democracy with a slightly higher threshold. It is a conversation that occurs where the community can come together on 
a path forward with hearing all voices and concerns and than these concerns are addressed or solutions are found. If 2-3% of the community disagree and have legitimate concerns with a HF this isn't consensus and the HF is a "failure*"
HF of this nature can occur very quickly if there is a catastrophic bug or problem that endangers us all , but are very difficult(as they should be) otherwise. 
   *Failure is defined where 2-3 coins will definitely survive and the original chain will maintain the moral high ground and keep the legitimate use of the name bitcoin where the new fork is considered an altcoin. Both sides will likely call their own chain Bitcoin however, but there will be a great social and moral hazard created that will haunt bitcoin and open this project up to various different attacks. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:22:05

There are different degrees of positions ... 
One group only wants to see hard forks for bugs or protocol failures = perhaps a ~1k  btc users of 10+ million
Second group never wants to see a HF ever and still runs patched 0.5.4 nodes -   ~ users 
Core devs are conservative when it comes to HF's but most of them are ok with them occurring if needed or consensus is found.
Both positions are extremely rare but the interesting aspect is these conservative groups tend to be early adopters who have many bitcoins and treat bitcoin as digital gold so their opinion matters in the sense of the economic vote.

Segwit does indeed have some scalability improvements but doesn't address the fact that blocks will average 1.7-2.1MB and thus be far more data I need to upload and download which will be a tremendous strain on my bandwidth. I will likely have to run my full node part time with segwit.

Jihan may be bluffing , but we must prepare for the worst. Take you bitcoins off exchanges and we will give tutorials to safely split your coins when the time is right. 
After the chain splits we can still win back a majority of hashpower by dumping our BUfork coins and reinvesting in the original chain. Exchanges will list both coins as there are profits to be made and miners also follow profits so Jihan may come running back to the original chain with a lot less resources when he finds out he made a mistake by turning on the economic majority.

One reason many dont run full nodes is the poor UI and look found in a core node and/or the lack of HW wallet support. I prefer running full node to validate my txs but most people place UX above security. 
As far as the 1MB number being ok for now , I get that because most people have the bandwidth to support 1MB from studying average speeds around the world -  , but I do indeed have some neighbors on 3G that cannot run full nodes now so your point is partially valid.

The minority chain will use this weakness to their advantage as only they will be able to get confirmations to load their BUforkedcoins on an exchange in order to dump and rebuy original btc while BU supporters wait long times for confirmations.

My download bandwidth is ~2.4Mbps down average and 600kbps  up average. I cannot get faster internet regardless how much I pay because of lack of infrastructure in my country(Not completely true as I could pay over 40k USD for fiber optic to be run up to my house). 
I have neighbors who currently cannot run full nodes with 1MB blocks because they are stuck on 3g internet as well.
I have not only studied my countries bandwidth in costa rica but averages around the world - 
4-8MB blocks have a profound effect around the world in very large regions and even possibly some whole countries. 
Here is a calculator to help you - 
compact blocks help much of the peak bandwidth constraints shown in the calculator above but do not address byzantine scenarios where one needs to validate their own txs the most.

Asking a member to propose a BUIP doesn't remove the fact that they cannot directly submit the BUIP. BU has blocked many very important contributions from more qualified developers like Jonny1000. 


Core has a better process where anyone can submit a BIP , get assigned a BIP number and a process of peer review occurs where the BIP doesn't move forward if it doesn't address the technical objections from any other reviewer . This insures that BIPs must be battle hardened and technically mature before being accepted rather than just be accepted by a majority vote of like minded groupthink.

You are trying to explain the benefits of registered value but glossing over the many problems. No , solving a problem often isn't a simple phone call with Fiat.




Merchants need to validate their transaction or use lightning to eliminate this concern, or at minimum have a payment processor take on this risk for them .


Only If the merchants are silly enough to accept 0 confirmation txs directly without additional protections. Almost no merchants do this, and for good reason, so you are discussing bad practices and not problems with the way Bitcoin was meant to be used.

With regards to altcoins discussed in this debate -
1) The cryptocurrency ecosystem is highly correlated thus you are technically not getting any more diversification by investing in risky altcoins. You should have a diversified portfolio, but in uncoorelated asset classes like stocks, land, and a fiat emergency fund.
2) 100% bitcoin outperforms the returns of top 10 index fund, top 5 index fund, or top 20 index fund even if you reindex and even if you invest a % per market cap or % per liquidity during the last 2 years .
3) You are exposed to far more attack surface and risk and complexity by investing in many altcoins
4) You are undermining your principle investment in BTC by treating the whole ecosystem like some risky penny stock list instead of digital scarce money and ruining the network effect. Digital scarcity is a principle innovation and investing in altcoins is akin to adopting hyperinflation instead.
5) Most altcoins are scams or temporary memes that will come and go, thus you are playing hot potatoes where you constantly need to re-index into new altcoins instead of investing long term. There is a very long history of many examples of Bitcoin/blockchain 2.0 that were supposed to be better or overtake Bitcoin and quickly lost most value. Altcoins will always exist due to people with short term time preferences but this set of altcoins will come and go and be replaced by a newer fad.
6) There is a single cryptocurrency that has proven itself thus far to be truly decentralized against a formidable set of attackers during the segwit2x attack (most miners and most larger companies and some prominent oracles) and Bitcoin shrugged off the attack due to the right incentives being in place. No other coin has been tested or survived such test and the main reason why many of us out here is censorship free **decentralized** currency

Your scenario doesn't exist for BTC either, please let me know of a case where this has occurred in the last 10 years....bottom line is that yes , the attack vectors do indeed vary a bit but you seem to be whitewashing all the rampant fraud that occurs with credit cards
A BTC merchant can simply isolate their network or lookup the tx on their second cell network with a block explorer if they want to be extra careful and this can be automated to reduce your hypothetical concerns. They should have 2 networks regardless for redundancy as many already do. 


One of my first statements to you explained that fiat/registered value has certain unique advantages over BTC ... also disadvantageous as well. They have different attack vectors and considerations.
Overall your security concerns with BTC are moot compared to the real problem BTC has, that will take many years to solve when using it as a currency = volatility undermining its unit of account due to low liquidity compared to stable forms of fiat.

It should walk clients through it step by step like most wallets do. 


I'll test knots and let you know.


Many wallets allow the user to choose the preferred exchange. without fiat besides the btc balance UX is severely harmed. Humans are familiar with pricing things in fiat and 0.00087542 BTC is unintelligible to most humans especially since bitcoin is still so volatile.
ok thanks for opening these issues, but this list is just the tip of the iceberg in bad UI , I know this from experience as I onramp many users and see them struggle with core and they prefer other wallets looks and UI far better. All wallets I have used have advantages and disadvantages (I.E... copay UI with regards to scanning QR codes is too minimalistic and sometimes difficult to find but the HD backup and sending and receiving is superb).  
I think I will go ahead and do a study by testing new users with wallets and testing ease of use and speed at execution of tasks within various wallets.

Immutability from changes is also bitcoins greatest asset. Just like IPv4 we want the base protocol to be simple and not changed easily. Other layers can continue to adapt and change. This is a far better security model as it allows users to opt in to different levels of risk and allows the base protocol to be far more robust. I'll be happy if bitcoin adopts segwit and it will be 100% fine if this is the last SF or HF within bitcoin. LN alone can scale to infinite txs with segwit alone as one just needs to keep the channels open longer. It will be great if we can continue to change the base protocol after segwit but entirely not needed. 


This doesn't make sense in the context of scaling. Monero is far worse at scaling than bitcoin. 


LN should be used and tested by individuals that are familiar with testing and or coding right now. Creating a GUI wallet isn't the difficult part and can come together fairly quickly , but yes, they already started doing that too.

UASF is still a work in progress , but consensus is at minimum made by directly asking every company and exchange in the space to find consensus at minimum and to take any objections to a proposal from the public at large under consideration. There is no node count vote involved although that can also be a weak and insufficient bit of evidence to show support as well.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:43:37


This is the tricky part. One way is to literally ask all known businesses running full nodes. Another method is a coin vote , but the latter is difficult to do securely where miners cannot censor and privacy is maintained. Perhaps UASF will use the first method , perhaps a combination of the two, we will see . Still a lot to work out to make UASF safe though. 


Which is why the miners will come running back to the economically viable chain when users begin to dump their forked coins . See I agree with you they are related , but you have cause and effect backwards. Just go back over the first day of the Ethereum fork and look at the hashrate swings as miners switch back to the original chain when users began to dump ETH and buy ETC. The reason that ETH kept a majority of the hashrate in the end is because the economic majority chose to follow the majority of oracles and specialists. The same thing will likely happen with Bitcoin , and most oracles and specialists support the core roadmap.

Depends upon the definition of "successful". A HF can be "successful" with one person or a small group. When I discuss "success" I am referring to almost everyone moving over to the new chain without 2 to 3 coins being created. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:33:44
The great news is the Holders can wait a very long time if security is needed, while they continue to reinvest in only the original chain after they sold off the split forked coins , while temporarily not transacting on the chain and continue accumulated bitcoins in the exchange until it is safe to withdraw. 
Thus even if a HF is state sponsored and involves millions of outside capital we can hold out a bit before even considering a PoW change, in this case if Jihan does attempt to steal coins or 51% attack we should change the PoW regardless since he sells over 70% ASICs.

Several options - 
1) 2 way atm  (you can filter by 2 way atm )
2) sign up for an exchange like gemini or coinbase pro, verify yourself, than connect your bank account , and withdraw the cash once sold 
IMHO unless you need to sell over 5k usd of BTC , it is much smarter to sell it by spending it directly because- 
1) instead of paying a fee to tx it to fiat you get a discount on goods and services 
2) you don't have to worry about tax exposure like selling on an exchange 
3) You don't have to go through AML/KYC verification 
Here are some options - 
1) Buy gift cards with BTC
2) Get 20% off amazon 
First tx you are restricted to  5% discount , so make a small one to test than a larger one later  
3) Get discounts from dominos, starbucks, target , wholefoods, uber,  dunkin donuts
It may also be wise for you to save some BTC till at least late 2020 as we have just finished a long bear market and now is the best time to accumulate before the mid 2020 halving when bitcoin becomes much more rare and thus making another large bull market very likely.

Here is some research to consider. -


stagnation with L0 is far better than a HF of this nature. L1 can still be developed without segwit and core is still improving bitcoin regardless segwit being currently blocked. Additionally many are working on UASF so segwit will likely eventually get activated one way or another.

99% of altcoins are scams , based upon discarded tech or just temporary memes that people pump and dump. 
There are numerous examples of devs that are serial altcoin creators who create a project with a bagfull of instamined or premined tokens, pump it, dump it secretely , than leave and repeat this process over and over again.
One of the most prominent ones is Daniel larimer or bytemaster is his old username on the forums back in the day.
He started with BitShares(which had several iterations and funding rounds where he pressured the community to buy more and also debased the currency when the original promise was a fixed supply) , than he moved onto Steem, than worked on EOS for about a year. He is not working on EOS much anymore and already starting another project. 
He has at least 600-700 million USD from pumping and dumping these projects. I imagine he is already having to bribe many people to stay out of jail.
Altcoins are a distraction because :
1) There is a limited amount of liquidity and the more of it that flows into them the slower a single cryptocurrency like Bitcoin can achieve enough liquidity to be a stable unit of account. 
2) One of the principle reasons cryptocurrencies were created was to solve a monetary problem and create **digital scarcity** and treating cryptocurrencies like penny stock investments instead of a scarce digital asset undermines this and thus we regress to hyperinflation where altcoins are constantly created and adopted. 
3) For almost all projects there are literally 0 reasons to need a native token outside of printing money for the creators. Even if these projects have the best of intentions the ability to print money with an illegal security (anything that isn't 100% PoW) creates misaligned incentives and will almost guarantee the project will fail 
4) There is a limited amount of mindshare and developer time and any idea that is difficult to be adopted on the base layer of bitcoin can easily be integrated in on the client side through wallet , a sidechain like liquid, or another layer such as lightning. We have such an uphill battle that we need to remain focused on a sovereign currency instead of distracted with all these side projects that many times have no possible hope of finding an efficiency.

There are multiple academic studies that have reflected this and it would certainly prevent me from running a full node as well. 


I believe the economic majority supports core's roadmap and any miners that decide to perform a 51% attack(what they would be doing because consensus for a HF definitely doesn't exist) will quickly run back to the original chain when many users like myself dump our split coins and rebuy the original chain.
This isn't risky in my mind because I am confident that allowing political hard  forks to determine bitcoins future will undermine everything I have been working for over the years. 
I am not against all HF's in principle , but definitely against all politically motivated HF that do not find consensus.

I disagree with Luke that it needs to be 100% (Otherwise there will always be be a failure because there is a small group that reject all HFs in principle), and these numbers aren't exact but will give you a rough idea - 100% large exchanges onboard (that reject listing the original coin) and 98-99% of all exchanges, 98-99% of all full nodes, 98-99% of a bitcoin businesses , 99% of hashrate, and 99% of developer support. There should be exceptions if we notice someone is sybil attacking to block the HF with fake nodes , where we than poll with a coinvote instead to judge the economic majority (as long as privacy is maintained.) 
Under this scenario , the HF will also likely be a "failure" if failure is defined 2 coins surviving, but because the lack of support on the original chain , it will be so insignificant that it would not be visible anywhere. 
Additionally , any group or individual has a right to HF at any time without the consent of others but this wouldn't be consensus.

The only thing I ask for is honesty from others ...don't call it consensus , and be realistic with the risks associated(One can almost guaranteed there will be 2-3 coins remaining after a HF that doesn't reach consensus) , social risks , technical risks , and moral hazard . If the users are aware of these things and still want to go ahead than great, go for it , I won't follow though.

This is a false narrative. Core devs delivered though regardless of some miners immediately breaking the agreement.

It was made 100% clear to miners and the community that they could not force any HF on the community and clearly the community has rejected all HF coming from core or other developers.

so you setup your coinbase account with the old aol email address, and sent the btc to yourself?
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:12:58


It is the most worked **Valid** chain (not simply longest). Even if the miners fork BU with 75%, 90% of all bitcoin nodes will simply reject those blocks and ban all BU nodes relaying those blocks and treat the BUcoin as a hostile alt. This isn't a matter of opinion , but simply a fact of the way bitcoin was designed.
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:24:16


A majority of the hashrate doesn't necessarily represents a majority of the users. If BU sets HF activation to 75% hashrate alone it will indeed be the minority forcing a HF on the majority which is a 51% attack that the majority will reject.


Sure, in principle I am not interested in another democratic currency that wishes to force its will without consensus and can easily be manipulated by a mining cartel. I already have fiat for that. I would happily stay with the minority chain even if 99% of hashrate and 99% of real users(not just nodes) adopted BU. This is extremely unlikely and most users IMHO support cores roadmap directly or indirectly as I previously suggested but I will entertain your hypothetical. There are many people that I know who would have the same exact opinion in Bitcoin as well and conviction to follow through.
You may consider this position irrational and not in my economic self interest, but I disagree as 
1) There are other things that motivate me than simply profits
2) I sincerely believe that BU is a dead end and will end in a eventual disaster where it is in my self interest for the long term benefit of bitcoin and my personal investments to not follow it.

Completely Unmoderated presents the problem with scams , slander , and spam. Bitcointalk.org solves this partially by allowing you to ignore certain users, but than fails to follow through because this breaks up the conversation and than others can quote the users you are ignoring which exposes you to spam and or troll comments regardless. This is a tricky problem to solve and perhaps needs some form of btc deposit that a user can lose under certain circumstances and some form of proof of work integrated to slow down the noise.

Alts forking off of bitcoin is nothing new. People should have the right and sovereignty to make stupid decisions, and we have a right to not follow their flawed forks as well.

UASF is attempting to determine this either by directly polling or a coin vote. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:26:08
The side that more passionately sells the coin they don't wish to follow will win the miners back. Miners follow profits and when jihan sees the economic majority supports the original chain he will come back to follow the vote and profits otherwise he will destroy his whole business. It is therefore critical we sell all the BUfork coins immediately (we have the advantage as BU supporters will have a hard time getting confirmations when transferring BTC) to drive the price close to 0 on the forked chain.

This is somewhat what a UASF tries to accomplish but the importance is in the details of how the vote can be done accurately and maintain individuals privacy. If we can devise a method of a coin vote that miners cannot censor and secure with respect to privacy than I am all game. 
This doesn't mean the 5% minority has to follow the majority and should have a right to opt out as they do right now. For example , if 95% of economic users support BU(extremely unlikely) , I will absolutely not follow them and continue on the original chain (but likely need to Fork PoW algo myself)

More info in case you are confused- 


You cannot unless you mine the blocks yourself (another option for "free" fees) I said you can reduce your fees , and since fees are already low , you can dramatically reduce the to clean up small balances.
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:59:50
In the peak of 2017 Tx fees were around 2-4 BTC per block and coinbase reward 12.5 BTC for a while , but you are making projections as to what tx fees will be in the future and I don't pretend to know what they will be. 
It is somewhat reductionist to say Bitcoin will have low security if it isn't popular... sure , the same can be said about any coin. Right now Bitcoin is the most secure , in the future we will see if it remains such

@_date: 2017-03-07 17:42:42


Everyone running a full node does, which is why one person has the right and ability to fork the chain. 


No. We are not discussing philosophical distinctions here or opinions. It is just a plain fact that ~90% of all bitcoin nodes will reject and ban invalid blocks even if a majority of the hash rate supports it. 
There is nothing in the whitepaper suggesting that we must always assume Bitcoin = most worked cryptocurrency otherwise miners could change the inflation rate or china could create chinacoin and out compete bitcoin in hashrate and than we would need to call chinacoin bitcoin because it is the most worked chain.

Technically we should create and test sufficient fraud alerts(Luke created the first novel one thus far -  ) but this is just one of many fraud proofs that are needed to realize a true SPV node.
... before we even consider raising the blocksize too high where we start forcing whole countries and regions off of home validating full nodes. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:35:40


Of course lite clients are effected by blocksize changes. During a HF a lite client can be left on the wrong chain where his entire value is destroyed. This problem is exacerbated with lack of replay protection and wipeout protection on BU. Airbitz and some other lite clients are planing on only supporting the strongest hash chain therefore not only can all the users value on the original chain be stolen but their value on the BU chain disappear due to lack of wipeout protection. This Fraud proof would protect these lite clients from dangerous HFs like BU.
This is just one of many fraud proofs that will be needed for true SPV clients.

Yes, it does slightly hurt bitcoin network security. Non economic nodes not used for testnet are essentially a sybil attack that have multiple negative effects from distorting market perception , centralizing nodes within datacenters , allowing un monitored nodes that can become compromised to persist and effect other nodes, ect,..
Economic nodes that are used are by definition excluded from being sybil nodes and it aligns the incentives so the user has a vested interest in patching it and looking out for odd behavior and reporting bugs. Thus it is very important they are economic, if not that is fine if simply used on testnet.

Another reason among a long list for securing your own BTC and not keeping it with custodians. 
More specifics -
The OP is referring to this company -  which allows you to take a 10k and up fiat loan and use BTC as collateral which you can get back in a year . They are basically making a cut between the interest they pay out and the interest they make from their loans. This is dangerous as they could be working fractionally.
So say you need 10k in fiat, you put up 20k in BTC in collateral(5.28BTC) and than start making monthly payments for the next year paying a little over 10% in interest.
Do not use this loan service!
1) if BTC dips in value you have 72 hours to meet the margin call and put in more btc or quickly pay off the loan or you lose the collateral
2) 10% interest is high, higher than many cc "loans" where you can consolidate your debt much lower APR
3) If you need fiat than simply sell some BTC rather than paying interest on a dangerous loan . It is irresponsible to not have a fiat savings account for emergencies.
Don't use the BIA interest savings account service either. Why? This is akin to storing your BTC on an exchange which can become insolvent. 6.2% is not worthwhile for the risk of losing all your BTC. Invest in the SP500 that will average 9.8% if you need to get interest , or just hodl BTC securely and it will appreciate in value.
**More general principles as to why you need to secure your own BTC**
Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

Or simply be a tech that works for an ISP that can issue a certain client an IP address of their choosing. 
Or walk into a store and physically take over someones LAN. This can be done with as simple as task as dropping a piece of equipment in the store.  


This is much more difficult to do than the taking over someones LAN. Also you can get feeds from multiple satellites in many regions. 


They are acting as another ISP to choose from. **People should not be dependent upon one uplink.**
 &gt;Full nodes instead are connected each other through a p2p network, making it more decentralised and harder to censor/taking down.

The reasons we shouldn't hold to exact numbers is that if there is strong evidence an attack is occurring sybil wise or hashrate wise specifically intended by an extremely small group we can take further steps to investigate and than lower the threshold or ignore those nodes but this must be done carefully. One way we can do this is ask those that oppose to come forth publicly with their objections and concerns and to hear them out.   
This threshold is high by design, because it would make HF only possible if there is a catastrophic bug or failure in bitcoin or if the HF proposal is so amazing everyone could get behind it(Solving most HF wishlist items and permanently solving scaling in a secure manner is one example). we want Hard forks to be difficult so bitcoin is extremely resilient to attacks.

By ordering the smallest inputs (those of which you'd need lots in a future transaction) in ascending order and then build transactions to yourself just small enough to avoid paying fees you will end up with a few large inputs which can then be used in future transactions, therefore paying a lower fee.

@_date: 2019-03-29 13:56:52


Nope. Segwit does not reduce tx sizes at all but is literally a block limit increase. 1MB limit was increased to 4million units of weight or ~2MB blocks with 100% segwit txs. 


50% is a very high number . Are you familiar with the adoption rates of P2SH ?


There is no reason to mandate it, the incentives are such that they will use segwit when needed because it is smart to do so.

Consensus code needs to work in lockstep but modularization through libbitcoinconsensus is allowing multiple implementations to safely exist and in fact add security to the network as we just saw with the CVE-2018–17144 bug which effected newer version of core and many altcoins but not other BTC implementations or older versions of core. 
This is why many exchanges and security researchers run multiple implementations to test for consensus and bugs and simply running one increases risks.  
At minimum any business handling large amounts of BTC (such a a payment processor , or exchange) should run an up to date full node from core (0.17.1) and older version of core (0.13) and another implementation like (BTCD, bcoin, or libbitcoin or ...) and check for consistency while at the same time having multiple independent ISP uplinks or datafeeds.(satellite or ISP or mobile or alternative ISP)
Satoshi's point is somewhat valid however as having multiple implementations does also introduce some security concerns and consensus problems so ideally the consensus code alone should be very consistent (written in C++ also) while less critical aspects of an implementation can be written in other languages and have unique features.

There are plenty of plans, but nothing will ever be formal as Bitcoin is decentralized and no one directly controls it 


It isn't bold at all. Bitcoin has already had 3 hardforks and almost all Bitcoiner's are in agreement that catastrophic bugs are a good reason to hardfork , and if not we can always migrate to a sidechain/drivechain with these changes for backward compatibility. At minimum the status quo of ~14TPS or higher would be set and IMHO this would be a good time to increase the weight limit as well.

Could be related to their server being overloaded due to everyone testing the app at the same time, I can use it but am having connectivity issues and just tested creation and restoration of a 2nd wallet in android and both failed. 
Since this is a 2 of 2 multisig setup the app will have to communicate with Blockstreams server at least upon setup. They don't have your private keys but their server needs a public key and chaincode for thee 2fa feature. 
If you use your own full node with this wallet does this solve the problem with Blockstream server uptime issues or does the wallet always depend upon blockstreams server for wallet creation and sending txs? If the answer is yes, we always depend upon blockstreams server ro send txs, create or restore wallet, than will the non multisig version alleviate this concern by not requiring communication with your server?

Bitcoin txs have always been extremely expensive . This isn't a ponzi scheme where we can ignore the true costs of txs by offloading the costs on speculators. We need to be honest with ourselves and acknowledge that the block reward covers the cost of security of these txs and thus is part of the tx fee overhead. 
The cost per tx was once as high as 16USD , and now as low as 8.9 per tx . Even if we were to add up all the legal, regulatory, infrastructure , and personnel costs with traditional banking their costs would be far more efficient than bitcoins costs. Decentralized systems naturally are less efficient than centralized ones by design. This is fine, because they offer a product not found in traditional finance.

We are just talking past each other on the definition of what constitutes wealth for the average person. The point I am trying to make is if a person chooses to avoid having kids early, avoids addictions, works hard, and invests early it is fairly easy to save up 3 million USD to retire on.
Even if you made a very conservative investment of a SPDR where 9.8% average is normal and 7% after inflation that leaves someone with 3.4 million USD in todays dollars adjusted for inflation after 37 years (18 to 55) with a small investment average of 20k a year. 10k average a year gives you 1.7 million in todays value. Most people would consider 1.7 million in the bank and owning a home and land outright to be "wealthy". This means one does not have to work for the next 30 years and can spend 68k a year without a mortgage which is akin to making over 100k a year for many if you had 1.7 million . 3.4 million would be akin to a salary of 170k a year for the next 30 years. Sure this is not in the top 3% But near the top 5% income earners in the USA and definitely top 1% worldwide.

Perhaps I am missing something and need you to elaborate on the matter. If I am an attacker I don't care if they are holding altcoins, gold, or BTC only. What I care about is if they have untraceable bearer assets I can steal and because it isn't registered value the transaction cannot be reversed easily or traced easily. 
If anything an altcoin holder is a better target as they likely have less security than a maximalist thinking as a criminal. 
There are plenty of BTC maximalists that have low amounts of BTC or are late adopters. A criminal forcing a maximalist to send a tx from their hardware wallet is just as much effort as a criminal forcing an altcoin holder to login to their exchange and send the altcoins out. A btc maximalist isn't going to have their BIP39 backup on them and altcoin holders are just as likely to have a crypto wallet on their phone like maximalists with spending cash.

There will be plenty of selling on both sides , but from what I have seen thus far many in r/btc are suggesting they are hedging their bets and holding onto both coins. This and the fact that many of the early adopters support a conservative approach and core means that the economic majority likely is aligned with the original chain... but we will see.  


Depends upon what motivates you.
It is economically safer to hedge ones bets and keep both coins as the dust settles. I will definitely be selling all my BUfork coins on day one though because I am more motivated to encourage the miners back to the original chain because I am invested longterm into the survival of bitcoin and my technical opinion believes that BU is a non starter. 


Many BU supporters don't want a compromise and instead want control thus negotiation is already dead. There are also some fundamental differences between the two groups that are irreconcilable. BU believes that miners control bitcoin and we believe that the economic users ultimately do.  


Payment channels were invented by Satoshi Nakamoto yet almost no business uses them after all these years. Why? If we keep kicking the can down the road and onchain tx fees remain 1-5 cents each there is no motivation to finish LN. We need to finish building bitcoin in a secure and scalable multi layered manner, and if we have to pay higher tx fees for another year than so be it. 
This also doesn't address the moral hazard and social hazard in forcing a HF on the community and how that will make us all insecure in the future. If the Developers or miners are viewed as a group that is perceived they can change the protocol without overwhelming consensus of the users bitcoin can easily be manipulated and attacked by bad actors.

3) If my assumptions are wrong or outside actors are subsidizing BTU support to attack BTC, than I will go along with a PoW HF -

Not really. I would say that electrum might temporarily have more independent peer review on the code. (Although Blockstreams devs are top notch and they did bring onboard new help to complete this so this is very subjective)
Both Green wallet and electrum allow hardware wallets and connecting to your own full node. Green is simpler to accomplish this than electrum though. 
coin control on electrum gives slight privacy advantage to electrum  if you use this functionality.(coin control is coming to green though in future)
Green wallet has better forms of 2FA though

The segwit upgrade(That Bcash lacks) in Bitcoin solved many problems one of them is balancing UTXO costs by switching the block limit of 1MB to a weight limit of 4 million units where different part of a block are weighted differently. 
Segwit improves the situation here by making signature data, which does not impact the UTXO set size, cost 75% less than data that does impact the UTXO set size. This is expected to encourage users to favour the use of transactions that minimise impact on the UTXO set in order to minimise fees, and to encourage developers to design smart contracts and new features in a way that will also minimise the impact on the UTXO set.

The attacker creates two different X block extensions of the current chain tip. Half the nodes are given one chain by the attacking miner and the other half the other chain. After this point the nodes are on separate chains and they will never converge.

First of all you are describing only the USA, Europe and a select few other countries. Those of us that travel and use banks in multiple countries have a much different and worse experience. 
For the USA, a credit card means the person makes a phone call, pays a 50 USD deductible, and perhaps has more of a hassle later on where the cost of the fraud impacts the merchant directly and amortizes across everyone where the consumer ends up eating the costs indirectly.
For debit card fraud its a much worse experience.

Some of these nodes may indeed switch over, but switching over requires effort. What I know about the current landscape of opinions and human psychology is many of these nodes will not switch over. 


Multiple reasons :
For better or worse most humans tend to follow specialists and oracles advice and most these oracles support the core roadmap(just like how most users followed specialists in ETH during their HF)
Many nodes simply will not upgrade because the users are unaware of the circumstances or unsure what action they should take so will stick with the "team" they are comfortable with. 
Some users want no changes at all , HF or SF , and thus will stick to the original chain. 
I have been around a while and know of many of the 100k and up "BTC club" early adopters, some do indeed support BU , yet most are conservative and  support core's roadmap 
Many regular users see that giving up control to miners is a bad direction for bitcoin and will not follow that path as they are justifiably concerned their is a miner cartel where Bitmain produces 70% of sold ASICs
The original chain will only temporarily have a minority hashpower 1-3 days I predict as miners follow profits
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:47:26


Of course I cannot be completely confident but I do have a good reason to believe the economic majority supports core based upon many facts I have accumulated over the years. The market will sort everything out with an advantage given to the minority hash chain as they can get confirmations far quicker for the BUforkcoins they will dump on exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:41:58
They have an active campaign to appeal to miners fears and desires to wrestle control from bitcoin users. They are waiting for 60-75% hashrate support . I suspect Jihan is merely using Bu as a negotiating wedge though and isn't serious about it , but he could be this reckless , and we need to take his threats seriously and prepare.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:21:13


Because the economic majority doesn't want a centralized miner controlled coin which has no future.


You fundamentally don't understand bitcoin. It is the most worked **Valid** chain (not simply longest). Economic nodes determine what is valid , not hash rate. Even if the miners fork BU with 75%, 90% of all bitcoin nodes will simply reject those blocks and ban all BU nodes relaying those blocks and treat the BUcoin as a hostile alt. This isn't a matter of opinion , but simply a fact of the way bitcoin was designed.

Don't be too hasty, miners will come back to the economic majority very quickly during the coin vote . 
A really neat aspect to this is the minority hash chain would have several advantages in this trading. First advantage is the original coin would have 25% or less hashpower therefore it will be easier to transfer the BUforkcoin to an exchange. BU supporters wanting to dump their original btc on exchanges will have to wait for seriously delayed confirmations while the original chain supporters will be able to get quicker confirmations to quickly devastate the price of BUforkcoin. BU miners will lose a lot of money here.

@_date: 2017-03-05 22:59:15
We should pursue a safe UASF process regardless of the miners activating segwit or not because using miners to activate upgrades has always been an indirect and rough means of determining consensus within bitcoin and it would be far better allowing the economic users directly determine upgrades to the network. 
This being said, there are still many problems that need to be resolved first with UASF.

**Coinbase pro**
Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They have a fee of 0.5%
OK- they receive with P2SH segwit 
Bad-  they dont batch anymore on withdrawls. It takes a week for you to ACH them fiat 
**Cash App**
 Good - they send with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you. They batch txs as well in a sophisticated manner where you don't have to wait.(last time i waited 1 min for a confirmation and the UTXOs where batched with a bunch of txs). You can instantly lock in the price
OK- The fees are higher than coinbase pro being at ~1.7% but actually lower than coinbase(1.49%) because their spread is higher (cash app is usually cheaper market price than coinbase ). Being that you can instantly lock in the price unlike with coinbase pro there is a role here even at the higher fee. 
Bad-  to deposit BTC they still use legacy addresses (not even P2SH segwit)  which is silly

I am a user and do not want a blocksize HF increase of this nature. Developers and miners cannot force this on the community regardless, they can try , but their attempts will fail.

@_date: 2017-03-15 04:32:20


Segwit is great , but I am patient and there are plenty of other things we can work on to improve bitcoin while we wait. 
Setting a precedence that we force users off the network or give either developers or miners control above users is a far far worse outcome that will lead to multiple new attack vectors. 
The fact that bitcoin is becoming more difficult to change is a good thing as its showing it is maturing and becoming resistant to outside attackers.

This seems like common sense and what most other countries do. It is very weird that the US is allowing illegal aliens to abuse so much of their infrastructure and entitlements. 
Some interesting ideas you have. I think one of the issues is the wealthy can afford to be very creative about avoiding taxes so if you tax them too heavily they will just not end up paying them and why many countries with large welfare programs are forced to focus on heavily taxes the poor and middle class(also due to the simple fact that not enough capital exists in the 1% to pay for the programs) 
So lets take one of your examples-


Right now long term capital gains was lowered to 0,15,and 20% which is progressive but no where near as progressive as you suggest. Your Idea of allowing the middle class to keep more of their stock earnings can help bolster the middle class but the sharp hike at 1 million to 75% will simply insure that the wealthy take an income with large tax deductions instead of a small salary and mostly stock options. No one will be declaring capital gains income above 1 million USD in this example. This might be really great for Bitcoin as the wealthy look for an alternative to stocks that doesn't have a 75% tax rate so I appreciate your suggestion. 


I like this idea , but it already occurs in many companies with 401ks and stock options that automatically reduce tax exposure. I assume you mean for the USA federal government to incentive the smaller companies to do this like the larger ones? If so , I think this is an excellent idea

The OP is referring to this company -  which allows you to take a 10k and up fiat loan and use BTC as collateral which you can get back in a year . They are basically making a cut between the interest they pay out and the interest they make from their loans. This is dangerous as they could be working fractionally.
So say you need 10k in fiat, you put up 20k in BTC in collateral(5.28BTC) and than start making monthly payments for the next year paying a little over 10% in interest.
Do not use this loan service!
1) if BTC dips in value you have 72 hours to meet the margin call and put in more btc or quickly pay off the loan or you lose the collateral
2) 10% interest is high, higher than many cc "loans" where you can consolidate your debt much lower APR
3) If you need fiat than simply sell some BTC rather than paying interest on a dangerous loan . It is irresponsible to not have a fiat savings account for emergencies.
Don't use the BIA interest savings account service either. Why? This is akin to storing your BTC on an exchange which can become insolvent. 6.2% is not worthwhile for the risk of losing all your BTC. Invest in the SP500 that will average 9.8% if you need to get interest , or just hodl BTC securely and it will appreciate in value.

To be fair , I have to evaluate all projects individually but I have reviewed many and have yet to see any reason for a native token to exist outside of printing money for the creators. Using their own native currency creates additional unnecessary complexity , overhead and creates a strong set of incentives for early adopters to exit even if their intentions are good. This is the same exact thing that happens when a wealthy parent dumps a ton of money on their kids "business plan" without any discretion... it ruins the business and their kid in almost every case.
There are good reasons investors look to see a company struggle to find initial marketshare and initial profitability before investing a seed round in their company. When they do this they often have many restrictions and very slowly issue out the money based upon metrics as well. Another key thing is these are typically qualified investors who can properly evaluate a project and not teenagers and get rich quick millennials simply buying into an ICO to dump it later where they get no real and enforceable equity in tangible assets of a company like traditional investing. 
There are plenty of businesses that are successful without creating an ICO. They just need to create a product that people want and use, they just need to find an efficiency. Traditional investing is always easy to find if they need up front capital and have a good idea , and if they cannot find any angel investors or VC funding from qualified investors it tells you the project is likely bullshit. 
At minimum a project should be 100% proof of work , and in due time if it serves a purpose than the original creator and investors will be wealthy. This insures long term incentives and an alignment to the project like you see with many BTC devs who often work for free on improving Bitcoin

The market will likely price in the scarcity beforehand and price will increase to compensate them. If not than you must understand that many large scale miners have sunk costs in renewable energy and or electrical contracts and warehouse contracts where they have no incentive to shutoff their ASICs even if they are temporarily unprofitable.

My guess is the 24 words can likely recover on another BIP39 wallet but fails to recover the green wallet because at the time of creation blockstreams server never got one of the 2 signing keys due to what amounts to a naturally created DDOS on their server. 
This is a huge problem with 2of 2 multisig because if blockstreams server is down you cannot create a new wallet, recover a wallet, or send a transaction even if you have your own full node. Sure many light clients have the same problem but with wallets like electrum you can at least switch servers. This is why single signature is really important feature on their roadmap.

Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
	
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading 
Day traders find that they become obsessed with checking the price and end up spending most of their productive time looking at charts instead of working for a salary.
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying
For most people the only advantage they have is patience and long time preference over those that are greedy and impatient. 
For day traders this is the general order of who has the most control and therefore an unfair advantage over you (or why you will likely lose money)
1) **Creator(s) who developed the coin** with a massive premine or instamine. This does not apply to Bitcoin because Bitcoin is 100% PoW and has way too many developers with no one in control but does apply to most altcoins. They directly make changes or can leave the project for others so have inside knowledge and can manipulate the market. Their massive premine/instamine can also allow them to easily pump and dump the market like a mega-whale.
2) **Exchanges** and employees of an exchange get more market information than any trader, often manipulate the market to profit off of others in many ways, insider trade, and are often massive whales themselves because many altcoins bribe them with a massive premine to get listed. 
3) **Whales** or Very large investors - have an advantage because they are more capable of creating bear or bull traps with coordinated fake media campaigns 
4) **Oracles , boiler room trading advisers** - These are the classic pump groups that you find on telegram and elsewhere where they will get a large group of investors to buy in on something while they make trades against them at the last moment. The investor see's the coin blowing up so think the advice given was right and than the coin crashes in value and they are left holding the bag and blaming themselves because they think they didn't get out soon enough when the cards were stacked against them from the very beginning 
5) **Professional day traders** who spend 50-60 hours a week trading and researching. These people have a slight advantage over the typical trader because they know more due to their efforts.
6) **Amateur day trader** (or you) with the least amount of information of the group and all the disadvantageous
Of course you can make a profit with luck but the odds are stacked against you and its more akin to gambling in a casino where the longer your play, the more likely you are to lose money. 
Unless you decide to invest the effort in becoming a professional the Best advice is not to play, and use the single advantage that you do have - **long time preference and patience** over those that are greedy and impatient.
When investing in Bitcoin you should always wait at least 2-4 years before taking a profit or wait till the top of the next bull run where you have at least realized a 10x gain.

The attack can be completed the same , whether the checkpoints are hardcoded or rolling. It is the checkpoint itself that aids in the attack. The mere fact that a reorg is prevented deeper than the checkpoint is what aids in the attack.

When adding Native segwit addresses for receiving please leave an option to generate legacy P2SH segwit addresses as well. 
Electrum and Brd choosing to force users to use only native segwit has made the wallets unusable due to the fact that native segwit is still unsupported in many services and the transition will be a slow one. 
Ideally native segwit should be default with a link to generate a legacy P2SH wrapped segwit. 
**This is super critical for proper UX**
Thanks for your hard work. 
P.S... Would the weight of a native segwit address be similar to a P2SH segwit address due to the fact that this wallet is still a 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 multisig?

I hope so, because being 100% dependent upon Blockstream's servers (until nlocktime expires) is a huge problem. This wallet is shaping up to be a perfect wallet but forcing 2 of 2 and all of its downsides from higher fees, more blockspace use, and usability when server issues arise is a deal killer for many.
I have been following greenaddress for a while, and remember the occasional server downtime problem so this is an ongoing concern.   
Ideal UX IMHO ---
1) One should have the functionality where you can setup your default node with a single sig
2) Than if your personal node falters be able to switch to blockstream's server if need be on the login page so you can use the wallet even if your personal node is down. 
Wallet can still query blockstreams servers for advanced features but basic functionality needs to remain functional.  
Bonus - have sub accounts with independent master keys where one account can be 2 of 2 with 2fa and another account single signature without
Another must have is remain open source for wallet and be able to compile its binaries from source. 
Most users really don't care about you profiting from premium services like sms or phone 2fa or liquid integration and use. In fact I would prefer you guys get wealthy from these premium services so you can maintain a good wallet the community really needs.... just would be disappointing seeing another wallet that really screws up on some aspect of critical UX like every other wallet does.

With checkpoints you don't need to maintain a majority of hashrate to pull off this attack, you can start with nearly half and bifurcate the network and quickly drop down to a lower amount of stake to remain dominant in each smaller split that you further divide... specifically because of checkpoints ... **Whether they are long or short**, because the initial effort in the attack occurs before the attack is even noticed with stake grinding and every split aided by the checkpoints allows for less effort to remain dominant on any individual chain because the checkpoints themselves insist they remain separate unless manual action is taken , and than what was the point of the checkpoint in the first place?

For the data showing you the shift in the last 2 generations perspectives read these - 
71% of millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to what banks are saying.
68% say that in 5 years, the way we access our money will be totally different.
70% say that in 5 years, the way we pay for things will be totally different.
33% believe they won’t need a bank at all.
millennials believe innovation will come from outside the industry
millennial's and Generation Z grew up in the digital world and have little interest in investing in gold or silver and typically  don't trust banks. People investing in gold and silver(or gold mining companies) I meet are typically in their late 40s or older. What is interesting about this shift is the key aspect of gold that these older gold bugs appreciate about their investment , being tangible and physical commodity that can be used and held physically , is the same thing that these 2 last generations reject and see as a burden or something that takes up space or inconvenient to store or secure.

@_date: 2019-11-14 04:31:24


This is a very basic question thus I am assuming you must be misinterpreting what I am saying. Since Bitcoin has no conflicting checkpoints there won't be a consensus split and miners will naturally converge on the most worked chain unlike with checkpoints. This is what I am referring to , the unconfirmed txs in the orphaned chain in BTC will be re-added to the mempool and than merged in at later blocks on the single chain ... thus the 2 chains "converge". 
 Regardless it is offtopic as you wanted to focus on a specific attack with checkpoints and even criticized me for going offtopic, now you seem to be the one that doesn't want to talk about checkpoints.

Yes you can claim any UTXO splits with your coins stored there. 
3 rules in claiming any Split coins 
1) Never claim an altcoin spinoff with private keys that have btc . tx them off to a new wallet first and never reuse those keys again
2) Don't trust any of this new altcoin software on your computer or cell phone . Use another computer , linux usb live drive, or VM instance
3) don't use online web wallets to claim , only use offline wallets
UTXO split shitcoins is an old fad that isn't popular anymore(late 2017 , early 2018 fad) and a Hardfork with Bitcoin isn't likely anytime soon however (most upgrades can be done with softforks)
@_date: 2019-11-17 02:01:26
Some other details - 
1) segwit2x was misleading "upgrade" in that it suggested merely doubling the blocksize , when it really was about allowing almost up to 8MB in blocks or a 4MB block average with 8 million units of weight limit. As we can see now , not everyone is even using current capacity with segwit that increased the limit to 4 million units so segwit2x was completely unnecessary 
2) Jeff Garzik (one of the only devs supporting segwit2x) specifically designed the code to deliberately place everyone who ran a light/SPV wallet(most people) original Bitcoins in jeopardy with the way he designed the hard fork without the knowledge or consent of most BTC users (you don't get both sides of the coin unless you are very careful thus don't have choice as an individual) . Even when other developers offered to help add and coded replay protection Jeff (lead maintainer of repo for segwit2x) refused which meant that users could have their BTC stolen and replaced with segwit2x coins instead of getting both sides 
3) The group promoting segwit2x kept suggesting that their code was safe and well tested... which turned out to be completely untrue with when many bugs were discovered and even an off by one error prevents the HF from even occurring.
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:39:00

Buy support includes market buys as well , not just buy limit orders. Including market order depth is a good measure of how much one can dump on the market before price slips. This is what I mean by liquidity. You appear to prefer to include wash trading.
All cryptocurrency exchanges have Bitcoin, and a smaller subset of these even offer tether. Tether has to compete with fiat and other stable coins. You know that exchanges , especially sketchy ones that use tether instead of fiat will regularly fake volume and bots exist.

Ok, yes, good security is expensive. We can agree on this. 


I never suggested anything of the sort. In fact I openly say decentralized Block Chains are extremely inefficient by design (with or without PoW)
With regards to PoS:
Proof of Stake is not new or very interesting, and exists as a form with fiat currency already.
Proof of stake has many more attack vectors(nothing at stake attacks, long range attacks, short range attacks , stake grinding attacks) than proof of work and ultimately is either less efficient or less secure.
Further reading -
There doesn't seem to be any foreseeable solutions to making proof of stake secure either besides obscuring the flaws. Bitcoin is deliberately made inefficient with proof of work as using provable work that is external to the blockchain is the only means to create real costs where the game theory supports a model where it is both profitable to secure BTC and extremely costly to attack it.
With PoW (proof of work) you would need to place a tremendous amount of effort in order to censor 1-2 blocks with building many asic mining farms, and than burning the electricity continuously in order to attack bitcoin.
With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before) to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff such an attack because it involves outside resources.
There are many different variations of proof of stake but the simplest way to understand this is by looking at those blockchain's as a democratic consensus mechanism where everyone's vote is weighted based upon how many coins or stake they control. Their staked coins than have an opportunity to create a block without proof of work and a dev controlling 51% of the coins gets to virtually mint ~51% on average of all the blocks . This presents another concern as the coins typically need to be in "hot wallets" to do so instead of cold storage leading to a more insecure environment.
Since most PoS coins have massive premines where only a small number of devs control most of the coins this also presents another concern as those devs can be targeted by states , hackers, or attackers or as we often see with altcoin devs they pump and dump a project and than move onto a competing project to repeat this cycle over and over again thus have an incentive to attack their old project.
With Proof of work , seizing the coins or stake of any individual or group of people doesn't effect the process of mining or securing the network directly at all . They can only try and spook the market by dumping coins at a discount while individuals like myself will happily buy up all the discounted coins.
PoS is being sought because it is a clever marketing ploy to attract environmentalists who are concerned about the electricity used in PoW mining. They may have valid concerns that I also share but they fail to see all the external costs in PoS.
It is akin to not adding up all the inefficiencies in coming to a consensus in a democratic presidential election.
There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

The yuan is already a "cryptocurrency" because its mostly digital and cryptographically secured . If Nation states want to use buzzwords like "block chain" and deliberately add latency instead of T+0 already achievable with fiat than they can play this game that was already done by Canada, Venezuela , Ecuador and others and failed. Blocks without work make little sense, but it will be entertaining what they plan on doing.

Likely because the US has a "progressive" tax system where the wealthiest 3% pay most taxes. Simply printing more money is more akin to a fairly distributed tax where everyone pays an equal amount.   There are also other complications from this as there will be more capital flight, less people using USD as a reserve currency, and more people using BTC if all taxes were collected with inflation.

No space is saved by this and all the data still exists in the block, segwit just moves the data to a different location in the block. 
Segwit separates the signature specifically to fix tx malleability 
Segwit is a literal block size increase by changing the limit from 1MB in size to 4 million units in **weight**(~3.7MB max blocks or ~2MB average blocks with most segwit txs) 
Segwit makes Bitcoin more secure and scalable but **does not allow for more txs because it saves space**, more txs are allowed because the limit increased

Segwit simply includes the signatures in a merkle tree(not extension block) within the input field of the coinbase transaction in the same exact block as everything else.

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

You are not alone. 
Consensus is a process used in anarchistic communities and very foreign to most people perspectives,who are more familiar with democratic governance models where 2 wolves and a sheep decide whats for dinner. 
Bitcoin is very different in the sense that it is completely voluntary and non -coercive. Developers working with Miners can tighten the rules with Soft Forks but the community can ignore those new stricter rules and carry on if they want and many do indeed do this. Anyone can contribute to bitcoin , opt in or opt out at any moment , fork the repo , and run any variation of software they choose to. 
This is a far different system of "governance" than democracies. It is a complete lack of "governance" and therefore very anarchistic. Notice the similarities with political anarchy's, rules and laws can exist within bitcoin but there is no force or coercion or leaders imposing the rules on others. These rules and laws exist because we have all opt in to them voluntarily and can change them through means of consensus.

It says they do not "fully" support pruned nodes. This simply means the devs don't want to deal with the headaches of someone incorrectly pruning their full node(keep in mind that the blockchain is always growing so you need to make sure you don't start pruning after March 2018 by accident) but technically anything before March 2018 is not needed. 
Lightning support is a bit offtopic as well as one can run a full node without using lightning.

 &gt; So.. Why are exchanges listing the current Ethereum as ETH?
All the exchanges were dangerously bamboozled into believing the original chain was going to immediately die (some lost many coins because this mistake) and there are indeed lawsuits being pursued because the HF and DOA split. Additionally, The Ethereum foundation is likely actively being investigated for securities fraud by the SEC. The SEC takes its time to build a waterproof case as we have seen in the past. 
Since the example of ETH, many exchange legal teams will likely be risk averse as we are now seeing. 
Bitcoin is much , much larger economy than ethereum and thus the legal ramifications are much more profound.

alts like grin and monero are interesting projects and not scams ... this doesn't mean I have any interest in investing with them because ultimately they are unnecessary IMHO. I'll continue to follow them and Bitcoin can take any useful ideas out of them if they occur. 


There are always fundamental tradeoffs with these solutions, many of which cannot be resolved and will never be resolved. 


Not with lightning payments which is what people will be using with everyday txs in the future and many are already using. 


The idea is to taint most of the chain with coinjoin making coin analysis a gimmick that gets only the dumbest criminals caught. 
personally I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi/samourai) than the base layer because:
1) The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical
2) I want to use a coin where people can choose to be transparent or private
3) In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
4) Placing tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs and resource requirements
5) One critical aspect in how privacy is maintained is higher onchain txs fees. With focusing privacy onchain and lower fees onchain you open yourself up to attacks that can deanonymize users. This is one reason , among many why its wiser to focus on privacy on other layers

The Bitcoin **tx throughput limit** onchain is currently 53 TPS(transactions per second) with batching and 20 TPS without batching, and will increase with Schnorr aggregation and MAST and future improvements. Additionally, most transactions should occur in payment channels, sidechains, and statechains and not onchain. Suggesting 3TPS is misleading to say the least in this context because it doesn't reflect the current transaction throughput reality when offchain txs far exceed onchain transaction and it isn't desirable to have everything onchain.

**12195/600 = 20 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max**, thus my 14 TPS is very conservative average

Of course you know as well as I do Blocks are often found quicker than 10 minutes so these TPS numbers are variable and sometimes it will be higher than this. Also this doesn't include tx throughput on other layers which allows for millions of TPS.

I am the original one who photoshopped that image above many years ago(I did not come up with the concept but created the images as often reused by many ) and I partially agree with you. 
Where you are absolutely correct is people need fiat to be a stable unit of account for short term spending. This means that as long as it can hold its value for a couple months than it is fulfilling its intended purpose and any long term savings should be done in investments like stocks or bitcoin. Thus quarterly inflation of ~0.5% is negligible. 
Here are reasons it matters:
1) USD is king for fiat, so the image would be better represented by showing other country inflation rates. Even if we ignore the extreme examples of Venezuela with inflation as high as 80,000%, many countries like Argentina have had increasing economic problems of inflation growing from 30% to over 50% per year. This means that If someone is trying to save up for a large ticket item over 3 months this still means their purchasing power has severely been robbed. 
2) Even at 0.5% per quarter that is a tax on anyone using it and robbing their purchasing power. Just because it is less noticeable to the average person doesn't mean that in aggregate a great theft and misallocation of resources is not occurring. 
3) Everyone should have at least 3 months of a fiat savings account but preferably 12 months of living expenses for emergencies. It would be irresponsible to place this in less liquid or more volatile assets. This savings account is taxed at 2% per year. (The average savings account interest rate is 0.09% APY, hardly a dent in inflation)

Any mining /refining platform could service  more than one asteroid and would  also service as a space docking station, military outpost, scientific station , and have residents .

You were scammed by one of the most prolific and common scams ever called advanced fee fraud. 
There are many different versions of this and they target greedy individuals who lack common sense.(I don't mean to attack you for your mistake but it is important to understand exactly why you fell for this scam to avoid in the future).
Never give strangers on the internet large sums of non refundable bearer assets. At minimum you should have used escrow , but even this is unwise as the altcoin you wanted to speculate on was also likely a scam.
This type of fraud is commonly used with fiat as well as you would notice if you ever placed an ad on craigslist. Receiving a check , money order, or paypal transfer in fiat does not mean you have secured those funds even if the bank says they are fine. Those funds can be reversed anytime in the future leaving you with a negative balance that the bank will legally go after you for. Only accept cash in person or BTC from strangers!
Bitcoin and fiat have different security tradeoffs and it is important that you understand the distinctions to leverage the benefits of both bearer assets and registered value like fiat.

Newbies to Bitcoin should start with one of many custodial lightning wallets which are extremely easy to use. Than eventually learn about non custodial wallets

no , the correct software will checkpoint itself, where the PoW or Bonds/staked coins can move elsewhere after the checkpoint is created and keep that orphaned chained segregated. 


yet all these implementations can coexists without choosing one checkpoint or central party to agree with 


The same principles apply to PoS , you are just replacing ASICs with Staked coins or bonds . A PoS chain would equally fracture with this type of attack ,  long or short. Spacing out checkpoints longer creates a whole new set of problems and largely defeats the point of checkpoints as explained in the link

This isn't anything new and opens a chain up to new attack vectors where an attacker with sufficient hashrate can insure a split is created that can never converge as one example among others. Bcash is currently vulnerable to this attack with its checkpoints

My country has its own currency , perhaps you assume I'm from the USA just because I cite a poll there ?  


Great. I hope that remains the sentiment among banks and regulators as long as possible.


This is a little confusing as worded. Perhaps you mean to ask if Bitcoin will ever go mainstream if a large superpower like the USA pulls a 180 and makes it illegal with severe penalties?
First, I doubt this will happen as enough large banks and billionares in the USA are invested in Bitcoin trading or investing from the CME, fidelity, TD ameritrade , ICE/NYSE, etc ... These people have spent a significant investment and want their pound of flesh where new startups and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges are making hundreds of millions to billions of dollars without them. Also even totalitarian countries like China have reversed many restrictions recently heading in the opposite direction you are suggesting.
Lets assume this occurs, and there is a near 180 degree switch and countries like the USA reverse their position and promise jail time and  felonies to those participating in Bitcoin. Than, no I do not expect mainstream adoption to occur in these countries that make Bitcoin Illegal to such a degree. This doesn't prevent Bitcoin  from being used , It will just be driven to the blackmarket which is fine as well. It would be a dark period for any "free" country to be so restrictive and a very violent one as well which no one wants to encourage but we must fight for our rights of association and speech and Bitcoin is one and the same.

Poisson Distribution  
is used where the average **range** when a block is found **during a random moment in time** is actually **20 minutes**
 
This means that the target is 10 minutes average with a Poisson distribution with some blocks found quicker and some taking hours to find leading to an average spread from a random point in time of ~20 minutes. 
This is another reason why 2nd layer solutions like Lightning are so important. Even if one reduces the block target time to 20 seconds(Huge problems and tradeoffs with such a short block generation target) like we see in a popular altcoin blocks can still take much longer to find due to the Poisson distribution in mining blocks and in person retail needs a reliable instant confirmation of 1 second or less like we get with a LN confirmation.

Yes, I'm merely suggesting that disk space requirements are the least of our concerns in the size of blocks. 
Hard drive capacity is the least of our concerns due to –
Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is ~210+GB for an archival node
Pruned nodes can get down to around ~5GB , and have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it (It actually prunes as it validates)
The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:
1)	Block propagation latency (causing centralization of mining)
2)	UTXO bloat (increases CPU and more RAM costs)
3)	Bandwidth costs 
4)	IBD (Initial Block Download ) Boostrapping new node costs 
5)	Blockchain storage (largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner)

1) Batching when you can (electrum and core wallets has sentomany built in )

3) Follow the fee market and manually set thee right priority 
4) Make sure you use a wallet that uses RBF (Replace by fee) so you can easily bump the fee if need be. Examples are Bitcoin core, electrum, blockstream green, so you can set the fee very low manually and than bump it up as needed

Repeat this back to yourself a few times and ask any database engineer. This is one of the principle tasks databases do.


You don't need "blocks" to create permissioned databases that need to be validated by multiple parties. This is nothing new and widely used in the industry.


Sounds to me that you lack an fundamental understanding of why blocks in blockchains exist in the first place.

Exactly. 
Blockchains have very narrow use cases.The only reason Blocks within a Blockchain exist is specifically because the Poisson process used in proof of work. There is no need to batch together transactions in blocks without this as doing so merely adds latency which is completely unnecessary as one can merely cryptographically link together a chain of transactions if one wanted to . This is also the reason many other projects that do not use proof or work are pivoting away from using the term Blockchain and using the term DLT instead.
Some people promote "Block Chains" as this transformative technology that will magically improve everything in society which is completely misleading. Block chains , with or without proof or work , are extremely inefficient "databases" by design. This inefficiency is a specific tradeoff to pay for censorship resistance. Therefore if something does not need censorship resistance than it most likely has no need for a blockchain.

**Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro vs Cash App** 
All these companies are insured and very easy to setup and verify with great UX. Due to its simplicity Cash App is a little easier to use out of the 3. All these methods require AML/KYC verification, cash app delays this until you withdraw the BTC.
**Pros**-- Easier to Use than coinbase pro. Allows you to lock in a price (but have to wait ~1 week or longer if its your first transaction 14-18 days) for BTC to be released which is helpful during a bull market.  
Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading=  ~1 week delay on withdrawing Bitcoin, more complex to use than cash app, highest fees with 1.49 % bank transfer and 3.99% debit card fees, overcharges on withdrawal fees or onchain transactions. They dont batch anymore on withdrawls.
**Pros**-- Lowest fees of the 3 when you use a buy limit order = 0.5%, unlike coinbase pays for your onchain withdrawal fee(But the week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on fiat arriving preventing buying can make you lose BTC unlike the other 2). They send or change to with native segwit and pay the tx fee for you and they receive with P2SH segwit.
Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading=  ~1 week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on depositing fiat with bank transfers before you can buy BTC, most complex to use of all 3.  They dont batch anymore on withdrawls.
**Square Cash App**
**Pros**-- Easiest to use of the 3, Best alignment with Bitcoin politically, Allows you to lock in the price immediately and withdraw quickly(once verified), No fees to withdraw bitcoin. The fees are higher than coinbase pro being at ~1.7% but actually lower than coinbase(1.49%) because coinbase’s spread is higher. They batch txs(mini batches) as well in a sophisticated manner where you don't have to wait.
**Cons**-- Only available in USA, despite having no fees their spread is slightly wider thus making them slightly more expensive that coinbase pro typically. To deposit BTC they still use legacy addresses (not even P2SH segwit)
Cash App charges no fee but has a larger spread of ~1.7% compared to coinbase pro on average. Thus you will pay 1.45% more than coinbase pro. The retail side of Coinbase allows you to buy with 1.49% with an ACH but will typically make you wait a 7-10 days to withdraw your BTC. This rate might seem cheaper than cash app but their spread is different in the retail side(coinbase.com) thus it comes out to around the same rate or slightly worse than cash app. Cash app allows you to withdraw BTC much quicker than coinbase as well.
Thus , if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar , but also likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount in a bull market.
Good idea to setup an account with either "Cash app and coinbase pro" or "gemini and cash app" if you are in the USA. Unless you live outside the USA , you should never use regular coinbase due to the fees. 
Use cash app during a bull market where you need to instantly lock in the price. Perhaps use coinbase pro in a Bear market where the delay won't hurt you or if you need to sell some Bitcoin.
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange. You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys. After buying your bitcoin withdraw them to your personal wallet**
If you need BTC slightly quicker or need to pay in cash than  or  but fees are at least 7% and higher
If you are out of the US than look into coinbase pro, bitstamp, or kraken

This sunk cost would be worthwhile however because the mining and refining platform could move onto other asteroids once psyche was processed and would double as a space docking station, science station, and military outpost thus be subsidized in multiple ways. It is not a coincidence that NASA will launch psyche 16 satellite in 2022 and is reaching this asteroid in 2026 as a priority.

The beauty of Bitcoin is we do not have to guess if his intentions are good and pure. The game theory and incentives are such that he will support it and defend it once he owns enough simply due to selfishness and greed. The only distinction I would make is that he is different than many in the sense that he is showing he has long term time preferences and doesn't need to immediately make a quick dollar. Good for him.

**Bitcoin (BTC) –**
99% of developer/specialist support with deep knowledge in cryptography, development, security with a proven track record of release secure well tested code and an ethos in minimizing centralization and maintaining compatibility, fungibility and privacy
Far more hashrate - 
Larger community of users with much better network effect
Far more merchant support
Far less mining centralization
Far more node decentralization
Most devs Road map is for conservative scaling and focus on security , privacy and fungibility.
Current capacity allowance is 14 TPS (transactions per second) average with most txs using segwit and millions of txs per second for LN payment channels
**B Cash (BCH)**
One of 50+ UTXO altcoin spinoffs from Bitcoin 
Few developers that are far less competent
Roadmap is focusing on cheap tx fees and many hard forks for larger capacity blocks at the risk of centralization and lower security. Favors externalizing costs onto full nodes and users
Currently doesn't have transaction malleability fixed so is stuck with a mere 224 TPS max throughput(but miners only allowing 56TPS now). Their focus is primarily on onchain scaling but are open the possibility up for L2.
Introduced another vulnerability with the HF called EDA that caused wild erratic difficulty swings and more inflation. They Hard forked to try and fix this with the DAA but Bitmain was still able to instamine many BCH/BSV
Is still vulnerable to this PoW vulnerability -  which is largely neutralized in bitcoin with segwit
Still has not balanced UTXO costs and no plans to do so.
Has different oracles suing each other and attacking each other from BCH and BSV camps.
Has a community that markets lies and deception primarily to promote their coin.

Excellent Article. Here is one of my quick summaries on the power dynamics within Bitcoin:
Ultimately economic users hold the most value and determine the immediate outcome in a Hard fork split. 
**Miners** have invested a lot in infrastructure , but have tight margins and typically have electrical and rental contracts where they cannot afford to mine coins that are unprofitable for long due to the community rejecting it. 
**exchanges** Have a lot of influence upon the naming of tokens or at least their ticker and act as somewhat of a large investor. This is another reason among many that we advise you to store your BTC yourself because we want users to be in control and not large centralized exchanges exchanges. They can also help predict an outcome of a split with future trading pairs. 
**Merchants and payment processors** give legitimacy to a chain , increase its network effect and influence more users to use that chain in the long term 
**Developers, specialists and Oracles**  They cannot force code upon the users and since nodes don't self update economic users can reject their proposals with as little as inaction. These people indirectly influence economic users indirectly because the whole ecosystem depends upon them for security fixes and updates. Many developers are extremely large stakeholders due to being involved in Bitcoin since 2010 and 2011. 
**economic Users** have the most control. Ones that validate the rules with a full node cannot be coerced into new rules even with 100% of hashpower deciding upon something. Since miners have such high overhead they will typically quickly follow the lead of these users because they buy their product and it is quite costly to ignore their wishes. 
Not all economic users are equal however and there are different types of economic users. 
1) **Spenders** tend to use bitcoin for its utility and buy it just to spend instead of long term investment. These cannot influence HF split outcomes much because they typically do not have many BTC at any given time thus aren't awarded many BTC split tokens to wield their influence with
2) **Hodlers / Investors** These individuals have a great power and there are approximately ~70 large whales in our ecosystem who have between 10,000 and 100k BTC . Since they are given both sides of the coin in HF they can quickly determine the outcome in a speculation war . These people tend to be conservative IMHO with scaling as they have greatly profited from the years of stability and have a lot to risk by any proposal that damages bitcoins key characteristics or security. With every passing year the amount of large whales will drop and BTC will become more evenly distributed.
In reality we want bitcoiners to be both spenders and investors and there is a spectrum in the two above with how much one fits in each category
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:51:20
That isn't how bitcoin works . I decide when to upgrade my full node , and I decide on the consensus rules . No miners or devs can impose changes I disprove of and was willing to allow the miners to fork off during the segwit2x fiasco last year. full nodes do not auto update by design. 2nd layer solutions I can simply ignore or choose to use. I will ignore many 2nd layer solutions and sidechains (bakkt and liquid) but love LN thus far and use it all the time.

Which is exactly why devs specifically don't encourage it, but technically is 100% fine to prune before march 2018 as long as you pay attention to it. So , yes it is unsafe for an amateurs wanting to use a lightning full node, but someone experienced that puts in a slight buffer and than readjusts once or twice a year is perfectly fine. All of this is a bit offtopic to running a full node as lightning is optional, but I am happy to entertain the conversation. 
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:17:30
TL;DR : Privacy is a spectrum and not absolute. Bitcoin allows you to be private or transparent depending on how you use it. 
I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning, or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi) than the base layer because:
1)	The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain. With certain privacy coins like monero their inflation resistance relies faith in the future of ECC security which might need to be upgraded in the future thus casting serious doubts on an inflation bug existing undetected.
2)	It is important to give users the option of transparency and audibility onchain, at least for accounts they choose to expose. 
3)	In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
It is far more likely they outlaw or restrict privacy coins (because they choose to market themselves as a privacy coin onchain instead of just giving users the option of privacy on wallets and other layers) as you can see here


4)	privacy  tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs and much higher resource demands leading to more centralization and greater inefficiencies.
5) Schnorr/MAST incentives most wallets to coinjoin because coinjoin txs become cheaper than regular onchain transactions and lightning is designed to be extremely private from the get go. There is still an option to have transparency and give the allusion to regulators that they can track coins onchain however. 
6) Coinjoin with a wallet is private enough, Look at what an employee of leading coinanalytics company says about coinjoin - 
Read this - 


7)	Here is a presentation on how Taproot can allow for UTXOs with untraceable swaps and indistinguishable payment channels. Taproot allows privacy txs to share the same anonymity set as regular onchain transactions thus eliminates the concerns with everyone forced to opt into a privacy Bitcoin wallet to have a larger anonymity set.
 
8)	Privacy is a complex topic that has many nuances. Many privacy coins have lower tx fees(Bitcoin has lower tx fees on other layers) than Bitcoin onchain(mainly because they are hardly used and have low value) . Lower onchain tx fees can lead to the risk of very inexpensive attacks to deanonymize users as well. Bitcoin being designed where onchain fees will grow to cover the cost on security (and as explained privacy)  and inexpensive txs occur on other layers(that are very private like lightning which is multihop and onion routed by default which makes coin analytics practically impossible) is the better balanced solution IMHO.

There are many nuances to security from 
1) Not having the whole network adopt new code at once and potential consensus bugs like we saw with CVE-2018–17144

3) Creating legal and security concerns that reflect a Single implementation of Bitcoin has the ability to force consensus changes on the community

Attacks can still occur, mining decentralization is indeed important , but even a centralized mining cartel will be severely punished with all their equipment and investments becoming obsolete if they attack or upset the users.

Nope. SF are backwards compatible and can introduce new features and improvements just fine. Hard forks need consensus from the community and if they don't they are considered altcoins.

In the end consensus  needs to be found in the whole community whether a roadmap is from years ago or last month. 


this is an odd question because most new implementations released have scalability and efficiency improvements , especially segwit which made many changed so its block weight increase is safer and future ones as well. 


No one is suggesting this. This is a false narrative created by altcoiners who hate Bitcoin. Bitcoin must scale in  many ways , onchian and offchain. Most Bitcoin enthusiasts are excited about sidechains, payment channels, statechains, MAST, Schnorr aggregation , and yes future block weight increases as cited 


Bitcoin is not ready for mainstream adoption but its delusional that much of mainstream is ready for Bitcoin as well.
This isn't a sprint but a marathon we must struggle to win. Sloppy patches to intrinsic scaling problems at this stage will lead to an inefficient and attack-able chain. We must be smarter than this and scale wisely.

Yes, the fact that it would potentially invalidate txs by breaking scripting makes it a non starter. 
We really need more testing on a Keccak POW HF and a Keccak POW / POS hybrid HF (which balances out miner centralization concerns and secures against an initial low hashrate as we ramp back up). and include as much on the HF wishlist as possible(If we are going to HF might as well fix those things as well ) 
None of these things will likely be necessary but the Real honest threat of them (like countries with nukes) should keep miners from performing a 51% attack. Additionally, if a 51% attack occurs this should not be the default first consequence as a speculative attack(coin vote by dumping the split alt) on exchanges should first occur to drive the miners back to the best chain.

P.S.. personally after such an attack I would suggest reinstalling the OS. Most of the time these attacks occur from getting involved in altcoins or downloading some form of crypto related software other than a trusted Bitcoin only software. Also be very careful to only upgrade electrum (this can be used with HW wallets too) from trusted sources-

If the "hardcoded" checkpoints are part of  the protocol than peoples full nodes will indeed automatically create a checkpoint , allowing for this type of attack. 


I explained to you how it happens and how it is different than a normal 51% attack. 51% attacks do not need a majority of hashrate either BTW, it simply helps. 
Let me be very specific with you for clarity. 
**Hardcoded Checkpoints in protocol every month**= pointless because any month long reorg attack that double spent or removed a whole months of tx history would never be tolerated and the community would simply manually reject that alternative history even if checkpoints never existed. Everyone would hardforked to reverse that imposed alternative history which would be embarrassing like with what we  saw in the DAO attack or at least attempt to reverse the reorg besides and than if unsuccessful follow the nuclear route. 
**Shorter checkpoints (ever day to hour)**= 
1) Sufficient Stake or bonds to create an alternative history is created to control the chain 
2) combined sybil attack reduces necessary stake needed to bifurcate the network and keep both chains divided 
3) Checkpoint sets in as designed in the legit hard coded node software 
4) The attacker than leaves the orphaned chain with a checkpoint alone after a sufficient lead is established and focuses their stake of creating more splits 
5) The checkpoint itself ensures that the orphaned chains never converge back with all the new chains 
6) The attacker keeps their eye on all the orphaned chains to make sure they remain sufficiently segregated and than reverts back any stake to keep them in their control 
This is much different than a normal 51% attack

Buy support is flawed as well as I said upfront , just far better than including all that wash trading in pump and dump altcoins. Go look at the exchanges that trade tether and sort by highest volume and see how transparently fake it is. 
The top 16 "exchanges" that trade tether are unknown exchanges almost no one uses  but have more tether volume than the real largest trader of tether = Binance(whose  numbers are also inflated, but has the real most use of tether)
Are you suggesting the top 16 exchanges listed there have more users than Binance?

Any hardware wallet that never connects to an internet connected device or at minimum never connects after the private keys are generated is a "cold wallet"


Stands for partially signed Bitcoin transactions. Allows you use a cold HW wallet , and sign and send txs without making it a hot wallet 


No need to do this, you are introducing unnecessary risks and attack vectors. If you want a paper wallet just write down the 12/18/24 words or better yet stamp/add them to a metal wallet or better yet make a paper/metal mutisig wallet 
Never make obsolete paper wallets that include a single private key for these reasons( paper wallets should be backup seed words) -

You do not need to redirect them with any speed if wanting to move one and could simply mine them out there and refine the materials to send along instead. 
From your PDF - 


rendezvouses with a target asteroid"
No , this is not what we are suggesting and inefficient. One would at least  build a mining station and refinement lab near the asteroid. 
Of course the amount of energy to get a shuttle out of earth is tremendous, but what we are discussing is building and processing materials as much from local resources found on the moon in combination with earth(remember NASA has expedited building a moon orbiting station and boon base ) and not sending individual shuttles for each mining operation. This effort will come at a great initial sunk cost and requires a moon base that is processing and building from resources on the moon.
 This is effort that must be done for any superpower regardless the mining opportunities, for military reasons alone which is why NASA is expediting our visit to psyche 16 and laws are being changed to allow mining in space - 
This means that asteroid mining will not occur anytime soon, but it also means the market will start to price in the future impact of this mining as progress is made.
The price of PMs as a speculative investment would simply slowly stop appreciating in value relative to fiat as it has historically done once NASA confirms what we know in 2026 due to multiple reasons -
1) Gen Y and Z just aren't interested in Specie and PM investments like boomers where and they are dying off
2) Countries will slowly start offloading their gold reserves to hedge in more scarce assets like Bitcoin
3) Speculators will begin to price in the effects of asteroid mining as progress is made. Landmarks like confirming the % of PM in psyche 16 , finishing the moon station and moon base, more investment and contracts for asteroid mining, initiation on building the station to mine asteroids, etc .. all would start to price in the effects beforehand.

There are a ton of altcoins and most of them have no privacy considerations 
The first steps to privacy is not associating addresses to IDs and changing addresses with each tx
Advanced Chaumian coinjoin with coin control is actually very well thought out privacy with a lot of work over the years-
The worst form of privacy would be linking KYC to addresses or accounts on a public ledger... but you know this
There are many nuanced differences **and tradeoffs** between ring signatures, CT, coinjoin, coin shuffle, SK-snarks, payment channels with onion routing, sidechains, etc ... and making blanket statements like yours simply signals cheerleading in a misleading manner.

Pick native segwit , but  its always good to have another spare wallet with some spending btc in SegWit-P2SH (addresses that start with 3 ) as well
**Bech32 native segwit (P2WPKH and P2WSH ) (Addresses that start with BC1)**
**Pros** -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~39-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
**Pros** -
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
**Cons** -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32
**Legacy P2SH Addresses (some addresses that start with 3, common with multisig addresses)**
**Pros** - 
1)	Like P2SH-segwit addresses compatible with all addresses and most wallets
**Cons** - 
1) 26 -58% higher fees than using a segwit transaction for the same priority
2) larger txs than segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32
**Legacy P2PKH Addresses (some addresses that start with 1)**
**Pros** - Like P2SH-segwit addresses compatible with all addresses and most wallets
**Cons** - 
1) 26 -58% higher fees than using a segwit transaction for the same priority
2) larger txs than segwit so more block congestion

1) BIP39 is only one standard, there are no official standards. Electrum allows you to use BIP 39 as well , which comes in 12/18 or 24 word options. 12 words is enough entropy. The first 10 minutes Thomas (lead dev of electrum) explains why he prefers his standard over BIP 39
2) You can reuse addresses , but for privacy its better to simply use the new addresses the wallet provides with each tx, but if your plan is to use electrum with cold storage than generate a set of addresses before removing it 
3) You can setup a watch only wallet . here is a solution 
4) You don't need to if you are just using cold storage , just if you are using a hot wallet
5) Electrum is an open source project therefore the software will never cease to exist. If electrum becomes unpopular in the future(very unlikely) than at worst you simply would start up your own electrum personal server to connect your electrum spv wallet to in order to use it

You start off by stake grinding 2 alternative histories before launching the attack and with the aid of a sybil attack split the network, than repeat this process **with the aid of the checkpoints** insuring that the previous chains never converge to split the bifurcated network further than 2 chains.

Garzik was deliberately leaving out built in replay protection as an attempt to coerce SPV clients to follow a new coin , where their BTC would be stolen without their knowledge or consent.

Do not store your bitcoin on exchanges or webwallets
Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are familiar technically with bitcoin.  99 % of alts/ICOs are scams and it is best to understand the basics before investing.
Do not daytrade
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 
Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well

Poorer countries typically only use one of the top 3 fiat currencies as their reserve .  The usa does have oil reserves like most countries but that pales in comparison to their gold

Please re-read the link I provided. The sybil attack on new nodes being fed the incorrect chain is an **additional** attack that assists the attacker. 
Focus on this paragraph - 


The fact that the checkpoint exists in the first place allows the attacker to know beforehand when the checkpoints will occur and than they have an opportunity to exploit the attack when a certain % of the community manually upgrades with the checkpoint , feeding a shadow chain and repeating this every time their is a manual hard coded checkpoint.

Under such a scenario, accepting digital fiat would be just as vulnerable which undermines your principle distinction.

The massive disruption occurs from the attack itself , checkpoint or not. 


Stake grinding and long range attacks are not related to a very specific attack I am referring to here that are a direct result of checkpoints. These long range attacks are pernicious because you don't have to expend any real world expenses that are outside the chain an objectively verified. The NaS problem exists. You don't even need to buy into a coin to attack it or directly own much stake . 
With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before), distribute a special staking wallet that half the network adopts to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff such an attack because it involves outside resources.
This is not the case with PoW. Owning stake is unrelated to transaction ordering , which is unrelated to validation. There is a much different game theory and incentive structure.

Technically, HW wallets are not cold storage if they are ever connected to a device with internet connectivity. They are quasi cold storage insomuch as they allow you to securely transact on insecure devices where all tx signing occurs in the HW wallet and your private keys don't leave it. Using cold card HW wallet without even connecting it to another device with PSBTs is an example of true cold storage .
HW wallets with a full node is one of the most secure and private hot wallets. 
here are some instructions - 
1) Setup electrum personal server(this is your full node) on that linux box 
 
2) Use electrum with your nano s and configure electrum to use your personal server you setup above (Full node plus HW wallet) -
ledger nano S crash course:
3) Record your 24 words on paper + record your passphrase on a separate paper you keep private and secure and separate from your hardware wallet and each other. You will both memorize your passphrase and pin + keep it in writing but not with your 24 word backup. Never store passphrase or mnemonic backup digitally. 
Consider upgrading to metal backup - 
4) Withdraw a small test amount of BTC from coinbase pro(not coinbase) to your receive address on your electrum + ledger wallet. You can tx those btc from coinbase to coinbase pro for free with deposit button in coinbase pro than withdraw from coinbase pro to avoid any overcharged withdraw fee. You are going to send BTC to your hidden wallet with the passphrase.
5) Confirm you got the BTC, reset your ledger nano S, recover it with 24 words + passphrase . Now you have trained yourself how to recover a wallet with backup and 100% confident you did everything right once you see the BTc again in your hidden wallet. 
6)	Send a small amount of BTC to your non hidden wallet(protected by pin) , and the rest to your hidden wallet(protected by passphrase). Done and send more BTC to hidden wallet account addresses.

This is factually inaccurate. It just is far more expensive to make gold in a supercollider than mine it in earths crust 


NASA scientists claim those numbers and are going to verify their claim in 2022 (arrive in 2026). Are they making up these numbers ?


It takes time to mine a 200+KM asteroid and its very easy to regulate the scarcity of these PMs as so few of these metallic asteroids exists and you need very high upfront costs to mine them creating monopolies much akin to De beers that regulates the supply. This means the price of gold and other PMs are not going to crash but also unlikely to appreciate like they have historically. 


You are arguing a strawman , This has never been my position. 


Any nation state that doesn't create these research, outpost, mining platforms will be doomed to be subservient to the nation states who do.

Avoid day trading . You will likely lose money. It is very professional. Most people make far more money buying and holding for a couple years in bitcoin.

Don't get too greedy. Avoid alts, avoid gambling, avoid daytrading , avoid altcoin index funds, avoid ICO's , avoid cloud mining.
Be patient and prepared to wait 6 to 18 months for bitcoin to recover or grow if it decides to dip as it will likely remain volatile for the next couple dis inflationary periods.

You are mostly correct, and the core slack certainly isn't the best place to discuss development but many technical discussions do occur there and core devs Drak, Luke Jr, and Eric Lombrozo are common contributors with some other core devs occasionally using it. 
Thus it certainly doesn't represent bitcoin core , but Bitcoin core isn't monolithic and I don't think can be represented by any one platform regardless. 
also keep in mind that the core slack has a bitcoin-core-dev bridge that many use so its more of a matter of different UX for dev discussion. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:39:04
A good way to keep miners honest with their fees is to :
1) Decentralize mining more so a cartel cannot be created
2) Implement LN where miners need to compete with payment channels delaying settlement if fees are too high.

There is no logical sense why a company would seek to pay for the overhead of support for thousands of "investors" and the affiliate kickbacks often associated with cloud mining when they could easily get 1 or a few investors if they lack capital to mine.


The way mining works is you always initially get a higher payout so it appears you are ontrack for profits but than difficulty increases and either the payouts decrease/stop or fees get too high. 
Think about it for a moment and than you will quickly understand that the only way you will ROI is if you get a bunch of affiliate signups which is simply another word for a pyramid scheme


Most cloud mining companies fractionally reserve mine to keep up appearances. Cloud contracts are in no way associated with actual mining occurring. Cloud mining is also dangerous for Bitcoin as it further centralizes mining

Ways to get involved without being a coder. (you are already doing number 2 ) Just item 1 , bitcoin never gets boring, as there is a wealth of knowledge that would take a few lifetimes to  read and much of it doesn't involve coding
1) educate yourself more-
2) Run an economic full node - 
3) Possibly mine with an ASIC after doing 100 hours of research - 
4) Perform translations-
5) write documentation 
6) Start a blog , or write articles on medium about bitcoin. 
7) Participate more on social media websites and forums educating others 
8) Attend local meetups and discuss Bitcoin IRL
9) Sell Bitcoin locally
10) manage a bitcoin atm 
11) Set various buy limit orders (In addition to buying Bitcoin at regular intervals)  on an exchange you use with deposited fiat. This will decrease Bitcoin's volatility by increasing buy limit support which is critical to both investor confidence and Bitcoin maturing into a stable currency and a less volatile unit of account. The side benefit is you can auto pickup any dips and save money.
12) Help answer new user questions on r/BitcoinBeginners
13) Help test open source bitcoin software by reporting any bugs you find to the developers. Most projects have a github page which has an issue tracker.
14) Donate to open source bitcoin projects and other bitcoin-related volunteer efforts.
15) Provide liquidity in joinmarket

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

Avoid this service . Not your private keys , not your Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:58:20
The larger the blocksize, the more difficult it becomes to properly secure the network
The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:
1)	Block propagation latency (causing centralization of mining)
2)	UTXO bloat (increases CPU and more RAM costs)
3)	Bandwidth costs 
4)	IBD (Initial Block Download ) Boostrapping new node costs 
5)	Blockchain storage (largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner)
This means we need to scale conservatively and intelligently. We must scale with every means necessary. Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains/statechains must be used.

I understand the law. Bitcoin was created primarily for regulatory arbitrage, and its security assumptions place it in dire risk if custodians control too much of the supply. The main reason why the segwit2x attack was dropped is there were enough independent early adopters and whales who controlled their private keys to insure the attack would not be successful. (many of which attackers were custodians with large amounts of BTC) 
Whether I like it or not ( There are good reasons why ETFs or custodial accounts are dangerous -    ) it will happen regardless so the best I can do is educate new users why they need to control their own private keys and the purpose of Bitcoin and the  pros and cons of registered value vs bearer assets. We should be encouraging millionaires to invest in BTC directly and not buy into ETFs or custodial accounts. We should be telling people to avoid day trading and immediately withdraw their BTC from exchanges as well. 
Insured BTC is nothing new either, we had it all the way back in 2013

Perhaps his investments in Zcash and Monero will be his backup plan for bitcoin 2.0 if bitcoin 1.0 fails due to a dangerous HF.

Yes, the numbers vary slightly every year. The point is many people in the USA have been misled into thinking that these countries pay for their welfare programs by taxing the rich and corporations more which is very far from the truth. The reality is even though the USA has the most billionaires in the world, and even if we used the flawed assumption we could tax them 100%, there is no way taxing the top 1% can pay for large social welfare programs. The only way to do it is by following the Models of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden which heavily tax the poor and middle class as well.

Most core developers really don't want to appear that they are leading or forcing a hardfork on the community for multiple reasons:
1) It places their lives at risk legally and in the way of coercion if they can be manipulated to force changes on the network. If they leave consensus to miners and the community than they are partially insulated from this. 
2) A hard fork has a greater chance of splitting the community and creating damage to the ecosystem. They don't want to be responsible for this , and I cannot blame them. A small group of BU supporters forking off with a minority hashpower is completely different than 75% hashpower getting the economic majorities opinion wrong.
3) Hard forks are less backwards compatible than softforks and thus more technical problems can arise and more individuals can lose bitcoins , devs don't want to be responsible for this and I cannot blame them. 
Therefore I believe a SF triggering a delayed HF is extremely unlikely to occur. If segwit doesn't activate in 17 the next step is to remove the 2 contentious issues about it: blocksize increase, and Blockweight change (that opponents like to call artificial discount but really is a innovative manner to reduce UTXO bloat) and retry segwit as a SF with everything else and than try other scaling solutions and proposals. 
BU and classic won't gain a majority as miners would be very foolish to ignore the expertise of 99% of specialists.

mining is very proffesional which means tight margins unless you are an established ASIC manufacturer, and there is a lot of research one should do before they start to heavily invest in mining.

Doing heavy research means you are less likely to make mistakes or aware that you aren't ideally situated to mine in the first place and will certainly increase the odds you will ROI and perhaps be profitable

All the incentives with ICOs are to exit without responsibility or a strong incentive to deliver , thus the very structure of ICOs are setup where even well intentioned efforts encourage a business to fail. The investors that ICO's attract simply are looking to pump and dump thus the liquidity that ICOs provide is also its undoing. Most Businesses end up failing , thus most VC investment fails and the few winners end up paying for the losers. There is a big distinction with Venture Capital however because with traditional VC there are regulations , qualified investors, stock and real assets typically acquired, and specific contracts drawn up unlike with ICO's. Many people don't like the restrictive nature of traditional investing but there are good reasons why these regulations exist as Illegal securities are not a new concept. Perhaps in the future someone can design a way for ICO's to be safer and with better incentives but that is a difficult task IMHO as one needs real world enforcement in some manner that cannot be replicated by a DAO.

we can estimate the amount of gold and PMs in earth , that asteroid, and the universe. The psyche mission that was moved up from 2030 to 2026 (launching now in 2022) is just going to confirm what we already know. 


No, as the asteroid is over 200km in width and would take a while to mine. Since the asteroid is a core of a planet it is mostly iron/nickel and not PMs. These materials are valuable for building other structures and stations in space , but the whole asteroid is not made of PMs. PMs exist in much higher quantities than on earths crust so we could more efficiently extract them but any mining outfit would control the supply like De Beers does which would be trivial to do because this is a metallic asteroid not everyone can simply walk up and start mining, and metallic former planetary core asteroids are not common either. 


Setting up a mining and refining operation would be extremely expensive and not happening anytime soon (but will happen for research and military reasons regardless the mining benefits), the price of PMs as a speculative investment would simply slowly stop appreciating in value relative to fiat as it has historically done once NASA confirms what we know in 2026 due to multiple reasons - 
1) Gen Y and Z just aren't interested in Specie and PM investments like boomers where and they are dying off
2) Countries will **slowly** start offloading their gold reserves to hedge in more scarce assets like Bitcoin 
3) Speculators will begin to price in the effects of asteroid mining as progress is made. Landmarks like confirming the % of PM in psyche 16 , finishing the moon station and moon base, more investment and contracts for asteroid mining, initiation on building the station to mine asteroids, etc .. all would start to price in the effects beforehand.

What is important is security in general. 


LTC has a history , which is a benefit from the lindy effect but as we can see with namecoin isn't enough in itself


most of LTC code is simply merged over from BTC core and 99% of development is simply updating to keep in sync with BTC. Basically no novel or unique development


Also dropped to  in volume as well and becoming more irrelevant every month 


nothing unique about this nowadays
LTC used to be unique because 
1) Scrypt algo was supposed to be asic resistant to keep mining decentralized. No longer the case as LTC is more centralized asic mining than BTC
2) LTC was supposed to be a backup for quicker confirmations and lower fees which is now obsolete with LN 
3) LTC was supposed to act as a backup with a serious issue in Bitcoins infancy , Bitcoin is mature enough where this is no longer needed

We don't even need to discuss hypotheticals because Bcash already has this problem. 
They have a minority hashrate averaging around 3 % Global SHA256 hashrate . Thus any number of pools with 3-6% global hashrate with a small Sybil attack could ensure that a split occurs where half the network is unaware of the other half and the attacker retains control of both chains double spending, or tx withholding and oscillating his hashrate between both chains to ensure more confusion and an easier ability to retain 51% on either chain where they never converge **to start**.  The checkpoints themselves assist in the attack because they can use the checkpoints to create many more than 2 splits that don't converge shattering the network into many chains. If the checkpoints are 12 blocks deep the attacker maintains control till the chain is checkpointed and than leaves to repeat the cycle keeping an eye on any orphaned blockchain splits 
Another problem - Checkpoints create a central authority or implementation to choose which is and isn't the valid chain which, if you remember UASF/UAHF in 2017 would create problems during a split battle which empowers users to defend their chain when changes that lack consensus are being forced upon them 
Other reasons -

It largely nuetralizes covert ASICBOOST by 2 methods- 
1) In order to covert AB Bitmain/ViaBTC will need to mine 1MB blocks and miss out on the tx fees from 1.7-2.1MB Blocks thus losing profitability . What they gain with 15-20% with AB they lose on less fees with 1MB block limit and an occasional empty block
2) If Bitmain/ViaBTC only mine 1MB blocks than their use of AB will be even more apparent and thus reflecting their dishonesty. Remember, They claimed they went through all the effort of testing and integrating AB in all their miners but have disabled this free source of revenue because AB is bad for the community and they are so virtuous.

This is indeed important for an ETF , and ETFs may temporarily have their place but too much Bitcoin held in ETFs places the whole ecosystem at risk. 
There are some circumstances where investing in an ETF is wise in the future (vs buying BTC directly) such as -
You are investing in Bitcoin directly but your 401k with fidelity is now allowing you to diversify your portfolio more with a BTC ETF. Since your occupation company matches 100% of any % you invest in an ETF (common in the USA) you decide to allocate 10% of your 401k to a BTC ETF. Thus even if you decide to withdraw early and get hit with the penalty, the company doubling your investment is still worthwhile. 
In almost all cases people should be controlling their private keys directly though and even in the exceptions like the one listed above one should also make direct investments in Bitcoin as Bitcoins advantages are mostly muted when someone else controls their private keys.

Both BCH and BTX as shown do not ignore tx history up until the snapshot point . There is no distinction between a UTXO snapshot and a HF spinoff in this case.


So does BTX. If you are asking if BTC nodes will peer or bootstrap BCH nodes that have split off , than no, they wont. BTC nodes will ban BCH nodes. BCH nodes literally have a UTXO snapshot that they peer among themselves. BTC nodes technically treat BCH nodes as a hostile altcoin. Right now BCH nodes are treating each other as hostile altcoins and banning each other as well.

You should not be buying bitcoin unless you have an emergency fiat fund , payed off all your high interest debt and are willing to hold for at least 18 months. 
Breaking these rules means that you are much more likely to be a weak hand and sell at an inopportune time and also damage your health due to stress. 
This being said ... here is some good news for you. Many investors saw their cumulative value increase after the BCash HF Split , therefore are no longer concerned about any potential Nov Split . If the segwit2x HF dies before activation their will likely be a price rally . If the split occurs the cumulative value will likely be higher as we have seen multiple times . Therefore don't sell any bitcoins till at least december. Investors are beginning to understand this and therefore I expect this rally to continue.

This only assumes one loading a channel immediately, which isn't needed. People can easily pay 1 dollar and wait a day to load a channel and than use it 1k times or more after that for fees of a couple pennies per tx and no waiting
It also ignores the unusual circumstance that is increasing fees right now.

Agreed. But so far I haven't seen any promising alt. 


As a fan of EMH theory I repeatedly tell people to invest in index funds. Index funds like the SP 500 are wiser investments than picking a single stock or handful of stocks and will generally average to 9.7% returns. 
An index fund of crypto is an entirely different animal due to the unregulated nature in the space and thus the amount of scams and nonsense being sold. 
Therefore if ICO/ALTs became heavily regulated to the degree the companies traded on the SP500 are than perhaps I would recommend an investment in them in due time.

Bitcoin is a disinflationary currency with a controlled supply meant to mimic the gold distribution. All of the BTC will be mined by 2140.  Unlike Gold bitcoin is highly divisible, much easier to validate, and transportable so there is no fear it cannot be used as a currency still. Thus Bitcoin will likely keep appreciating in value and you will still be able to buy coffee with it
1) Bitcoin is divisible by 8 decimal places onchain and 1/1000 of a satoshi on lightning network today . Thus even if 1BTC grew to 1 million usd , onchain 1 satoshi(smallest denomination onchain) would equal 0.01 usd or 1 penny and 1/1000th of a penny on layer 2 BTC which allows for micro-txs
2) Another concern is how will miners be paid to secure the network once mining ends in 2140? There will be a gradual shift where the accumulation of millions of transaction fees pay for the security when coinbase reward(nothing to do with the company) ends. In fact this has already started to occur as we saw last year when coinbase reward per block was 12.5 BTC and tx fees were 2-4BTC per block . In 2020 when the coinbase reward drops to 6.25 BTC we will likely thereafter start to see instances when the total cumulative fees for txs per block exceed this coinbase reward. In 2140 it will be 100% tx fees to secure the blockchain

As the value of BTC goes up that should prompt you to invest in a hardware wallet. If someone is buying a very small amount of BTC , say 100 usd worth , it would be wiser to first buy more BTC before getting a hardware wallet as that 170 usd worth could easily become 1,700 usd worth in the next bull run as we have seen many times before allowing the investor to buy a hardware wallet and pocket an additional 630 usd in value.

No because with PoW , the cost to create fungible value closely tracks the cost of burning registered value and why courts have decided that BTC is not a security. With an ICO premine the value is arbitrary set by the founders that often manipulate demand by also buying into their own presale.
During a split the issuance is also being given to opponents of a competing chain. This is why the cumulative value of BTc post split is somewhat close to the value presplit. We witnessed the same thing occur with ETH /ETC split. With a premine , it is all controlled by insiders and early investors , not opponents.

The difference is with PoW you have to burn registered value to create fungible value and thus the snapshot represents a distribution issued to users on a competing chain where the market can determine true price discovery unlike the ETH premine where developers and ICO investors can lock up their tokens creating a bubble. 
Thus the market will quickly price in the split (as we are seeing by BTC slightly dropping and the value of BCH corresponding to the difference) unlike with premines.

segwit changes the limit from 1MB to a weight of 4 million units which allows blocks to be up to 4MB in size , but realistically we won't see blocks larger than 3.7MB like this segwit block
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:39:37


Agreed, The segwit2x proposal is absurd because B Cash already gives them their 8MB limit they want.


This would set the precedent that developers could and would give up their principles and what they genuinely believe to be best tech decisions to appease a few businesses(20%) . This is the far worse outcome and It would instantly discredit any dev who reverses their opinion for political means.

The reason some blocks are barely over 1MB now is because so few people are using segwit. The more people that use segwit the larger the blocksize. If 100% of txs were segwit we would see blocks averaging around 1.7-2.1MB and peaking around 3.7MB. 
Right now ledger and trezor are the only 2 wallets with segwit easy to use now , but electrum , greenbits , and greenaddress will be allowing segwit addresses soon so the blocksize will really start to grow. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:27:36
Almost no one is running full nodes with BCH as B Cash users don't care much about decentralization or security. So any spam attack to bring down full nodes or increase full node resource costs isn't really worthwhile. 
I better attack (not suggesting anyone do this) is to mine empty blocks every hour and 50 minutes to prevent the EDA kicking in and than really slow tx confirmations from occurring.

Ultimately we want to empower and educate users rather than tricking light clients into accepting rule changes they are unaware of or disagree with.
One very big problem, among many,  with segwit2x is that Jeff is deliberately not adding full replay protection because he is attempting to subvert and trick light wallets into simply following the most hashrate instead of knowing the rules are changing and making a decision for themselves. 
Ultimately , all users need to be informed for hard forks that impose rule changes.

Bitcoin is still volatile so you shouldn't invest what you cannot afford to hold for 1-5 years. 
1) Do not buy any bitcoin unless you are willing to do at least 1 hour of research.
2) First buy a small amount to test and use it . Good place is to save 15-20% off amazon on purse.io with those test bitcoins.
3) If you are buying over 1 BTC worth than get a hardware wallet
4) Do not ever go full in bitcoin because even though its much more stable these days it is less stable than USD fiat
5) YEs, do indeed set limit buy orders in between 1 to 10 % below spot price to buy on the dips but also buy in with some of your investment at market price otherwise you may never get in.

No. First of all ~89.56 of full nodes all are segwit ready -  
Secondly, signature validation is only one aspect of many to full node validation. So you would be more accurate to suggest that in order for the remaining 10.5% of nodes to **fully validate** they need to upgrade ... but not necessarily to btc1 as bitpay misleadingly implies.  They can upgrade to one of many different versions of core or any alternative segwit ready implementation over the last year.

Import keeps the Bitcoins on the original private key, while Sweep sends the Bitcoins to a whole new private key connected to the software wallet. As a rule of thumb, sweeping is more recommended than importing.
There are privacy, loss and security concerns with importing - 
Importing a private keys advantage is it removes an onchain tx fee but fees are very low right now so it isn't worth it .

tether is used by many shitcoin exchanges for illegal securities around the world.

Many exchanges don't even accept direct fiat deposits, where only the coins on exchanges that accept fiat directly will be less effected, but the whole market would further crash.

13. If the transaction is a coinbase transaction then it must have a maturity of 100 confirmations.
14. For each input the output must exist and not have been spent.
15. Check that each input value is in the required range.
16. Reject if the input value is less than the output value.
17. Reject if the transaction value is to low to get into an empty block.

Segwit doesn't stop covert or overt ASICboost. Antpool can still mine covert AB with 1 MB blocksizes . Segwit just undermines it by 
1) Antpool can have a 20% mining advantage but misses out on fees for doubling the average blocksize. Fees right now are 2-6BTC for 1MB blocks so they could lose out on 1-5BTC per block in tx fees 
2) If they continue AB once blocksizes start to grow over 1MB their lies will become even more  apparent

AB is likely being done on all of Viabtc, antpools, btc.tops blocks , the side effect is an occasional empty block to do so covertly. To avoid this empty block they need to forgo spy mining and covert AB.

Segwit is a fantastic piece of engineering. It does have some disadvantages however... being that it increases the block size for more tx by almost double. This of course is an advantage as well because it allows for more capacity , and luckily segwit improves scalability to mitigate the negative impact of increasing the blocksize. 
Some miners are taking longer to upgrade because making the changes is more work than upgrading a full node alone. 
Other miners are apprehensive because they want to see more of the community rally behind segwit first. This may take another month or two , or longer.

Most txs would need to be offchain if we saw widespread adoption now, but there are good reasons why we don't want to see widespread adoption until LN payment channels exist. 0 conf txs are insecure.

And the value of BTc during that time was also trivial or none. 


The difference is during a split the issuance is also being given to opponents of a competing chain. This is why the cummalative value of BTc/BCH post split is somewhat close to the value presplit. We witnessed the same thing occur with ETH /ETC split. With a premine , it is all controlled by insiders and early investors , not opponents.

If the checkpoints are manually set by developers with each update or at planned set updated like monero with their HFs , than what happens to all the old unupdated nodes? Are you suggesting that full nodes will be forced to update via automatic updates? If not than this attack will still occur because some of the nodes will have the newest checkpoint and other will not and a range of different checkpoints will exist between nodes. If all nodes are forced to auto update to the newest node software than you just opened yourself another can of worms.  
If the protocol automatically sets a checkpoint at a periodic basis automatically , this is a rolling checkpoint whether its 10 blocks, 100 blocks , or 1000 blocks.

Your using the term "application" in a non standard manner. LN is absolutely incompatible with most blockchains. Sure you can redesign it where it can be made compatible with something else but that requires a lot of changes and testing.(years of work)


Bitcoin has the longest history of working. Onchain txs fees are a few pennies , and if future onchain fees increase it doesn't directly effect LN txs as one does not need to directly make any onchain BTC tx to load or reload a LN channel. 


I agree there remains a ton of work to do. Don't believe the marketing hype in altcoins either. Stick to understanding the technology and limitations of such.

Ln is private for many reasons. Onion routing is just one aspect.
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:53:48


But they can receive segwit txs.
Non Upgraded nodes don't validate one aspect (amoung many) of txs thus when they receive a segwit tx they will validate everything but signatures and than wait to even show the txs till included in the block(one conf.) unlike when they receive a txs from a non segwit wallet/node. 


You are ignoring the many ways full nodes validate still. The non-upgraded nodes no longer are considered full because they do not validate **signatures** of **some** txs but they still validate many other aspects within a txs as I listed for you.
@_date: 2017-01-21 04:23:32


If LN can do 2000 TPS per channel(Not the whole network , just one channel) and higher that means we can surpass Visa levels of tx capacity with only 2MB blocks and may not need any HFs ever. I am not opposed to a HF if one is needed but rather do one to take care of everything flex cap + HF wishlist or not do one at all because their is a certain value in not HF itself (Immutability, backward compatibility). There is also so many other scaling solutions that need to be explored that I rather not go down a path where we take the easy way by simply increasing the block without accounting for the externalities.

Miners also dont decide upon hardforks for users either. Miners can choose to HF if they want but cannot force economic nodes to HF.
13% of companies in our ecosystem are against segwit2x and 79% have not agreed to it . There are plenty of large companies in both those categories .
NYA signers haven't even bothered to ask their clients yet either and some like bitpay have already started lying to their clients. 
If a split occurs in Mid November than over 99% of the bitcoin nodes (110k nodes) would ban btc1 segwit2x nodes and invalidate all their blocks instantly as the code is designed with no human node operator involvement needed. NYA signers created and altcoin.

we need to have tx fees eventually excede block reward. this has always been the plan. some naively believe this can be done with many small fees all on chain,while others who have done the math think the best way forward is settling smaller amounts of txs for high fees onchain and payment channels with low fees for regular txs.
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:26:10


great, but most txs can be sent through a LN channel 


Yep, supporting the UX issues I am talking about we need to work on . Lets get them to accept Ln 


more existing users using LN and sidechains doesn't mean this will happen anytime soon. We don't know this time around what to expect during the next massive appreciation bubble. 
also you can already buy BTC directly from a lightning channels without any onchain tx. 


There is an long list of existing exchanges that allow you to buy btc directly to retop a channel


I'm suggesting the greatest concerns right now , not that there 
aren't more concerns of lesser priority


Yep , it was there all along 
Not smart to increase blocksizes now when we have plenty of excess space due to unupgraded nodes , and the fact that its wiser to increase onchain capacity first with Schnorr aggregation and MAST

Many of us consider segwit2x an attack on bitcoin. What good is a Majority hashrate if it is attacking our rules we agreed to? Additionally, your numbers don't match up with reality as hashrate will be rapidly oscillating between 3 chains if they fork.


I care about the longterm health of bitcoin. introducing an attack vector where a small part of the ecosystem (20% of businesses ) can decide on changing the rules without the community consent is unacceptable. I would rather go through a temporary rough patch now with lower hashrate as I dump my barrycoins like I am still doing with my BCash (will take me months to offload these due to lack of BCH liquidity) or change the PoW than to follow segwit2x.

Unless it is your full time profession you should not day trade at all.
Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
	
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading 
Day traders find that they become obsessed with checking the price and end up spending most of their productive time looking at charts instead of working for a salary.
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing(remember long term cap gains in the USA is 1 year or more), but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying
Insiders, full time professional day traders, and oracles will tend to eat part time amateur day traders lunches

It is the way the code, even from the first release, functions and is designed, but yes , also in the whitepaper in section 8. 


vulnerable   if   the   network   is   overpowered   by   an   attacker.     While   network   nodes   can   verify
transactions   for   themselves,   the   simplified   method   can   be   fooled   by   an   attacker's   fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.   One strategy to
protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid
block,   prompting   the   user's   software   to   download   the   full   block   and   alerted   transactions   to
confirm the inconsistency.  **Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.**"


The way the code has always worked is it doesn't matter how much hashrate an attaker has. If they create or relay a block with changed rules all full nodes immediately ban the attacker node(mining or non mining ) and mark the block as invalid.

    how does segwit stop it?
Segwit doesn't stop covert or overt ASICboost. Antpool can still mine covert AB with 1 MB blocksizes . Segwit just undermines it by
1) Antpool can have a 20% mining advantage but misses out on fees for doubling the average blocksize. Fees right now are 2-6BTC for 1MB blocks so they could lose out on 1-5BTC per block in tx fees
2) If they continue AB once blocksizes start to grow over 1MB their lies will become even more apparent

Merchant processors use coin analytics, fraud algos , and many distributed listening nodes, and CPFP to fee bump as needed in addition to the 2 items you cited. This is why 0 confirmation is much more dangerous when not using all the above methods. 
"high enough txs fees" is not a good method as many people like me always spend 1-2 sats a byte so you would essentially be waiting for a confirmation for all of us. 
The main security aspects of 0 conf txs for low priced items are :
1) Too risky for in person merchant txs as cameras and witnesses deter multiple fraud attempts
2) Items than ship online tend to be sent out after the double spend is attempted 
Thus the main concern is digital items and subscriptions(remember Todd easily buying reddit gold with a doublespend without RBF and the mempool wasn't large) and other concern is merchants with efficient supply chains like amazon that begin the delivery process immediately upon purchase

No problem here is more analysis focusing on 8MB and only full nodes in the capital city with highest speed connections.- 
8 MB requires 2.987Mbps up minimum for 8 peers unrestricted. 
I see many countries in this list with average upload speeds lower than this , and even if you look at peak speeds in capital cities you have to consider that home users cannot use all of their bandwidth for their home node as they have multiple users and devices sharing the uplink.
Lets take one of many examples and drive down on the evidence to only focus on the speeds in a capital city-
 1.3MB upload ... so even if one would to use 100% of the bandwidth it couldn't handle the above.
Here is another capital city -
 588kbps up
Almost the whole continent of Africa would be forced to use a VPS as well. Wow!
Also I don't agree we should force all nodes offline outside of capital cities either, but even if we consider the whole country you would be forcing users to rent VPS's in many countries or severely limit their full node.

Agreed, but there is a bit of confusion with the UX . Too late now , but since segwit is regular bitcoin and a softfork having distinct wallet interface like separating the blockchain with the altcoin BCH conflates the two and causes confusion. 
I would have preferred to simply have the same bitcoin wallet where I can choose between segwit and non segwit addresses within the same wallet.

Since Bitcoin retained majority hashrate it was wiser to expect the followup pump which occurred exactly as expected. Many of us have too many BCH to dump all at once , and its wiser to have BCash supporters to pay top dollar for them so we can reinvest in more btc.

xtremely large blocks = When the block size grows to where all home users in many countries are forced to only run full unrestricted (8 peer default setting) nodes in expensive VPS's I would call it xtremely large. 
This is a rolling definition dependent upon worldwide infrastructure and scalability solutions being coded that make bitcoin more efficient.    
Right now 1.7 to 2MB is pushing it and I would consider large because it further centralizes nodes regardless the scalability improvements in segwit .
4-8 MB is very large and will force many regions and some countries to only run unrestricted nodes in datacenters. 
8MB and up is extremely large because it will force almost all of africa( a whole continent ) as well as many other countries to run unrestricted nodes in datacenters.

In fact the first released software from satoshi had mining disabled by default. 


No he is discussing what would happen if an attacker (51% attack) attempted to change some existing rules without full nodes consent and how both full nodes and SPV nodes can guard against an attacker. 
You don't need to take my word for it , look at the code from every release since the beginning , setup a testnet with at least 2 nodes , one mining and one nonmining. Than see what happens to any blocks with different changed rules that attempt to be relayed to the nonmining node. The node with 0 hashrate will ban the node with 100% "network" hashrate and mark the block as invalid

It should NOT be the exclusive indicator but one among many. Miners should hold off on activating segwit until companies , exchanges, and developers are highly supporting its adoption in addition to a high node adoption. Right now I see extremely high support among developers, good support with companies and wallet makers (but this could improve a bit more first), and ok support among exchanges (coinbase just said they approved, bitfinix supports segwit ,  BTCC supports, and others but would like to hear from other exchanges as well)

It makes perfect sense in game theory and this outcome was perfectly predictable. You can read between the lines they want a compromise with an included HF giving the blocksize up to 8MB max size and are trying to force the compromise. It would be wise of us to stick to the first compromise of almost doubling capacity. 
It is also predictable that BU will fail like all other coup attempts because both the economic majority, majority of users, and majority of oracles and specialists support the core scaling roadmap. All that the noisy few will do is delay capacity progress and developers and the rest of us can improve bitcoin in ways that don't depend upon segwit activating. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:33:14
Its possible but highly unlikely because of both the rules of a 30 second delay and that the first tx must be equal to greater fee per byte. One of the best ways to easily double spend 0 conf is by having a larger tx fee on the 2nd tx so this makes it difficult . Being that the attacker in reality doesn't have these restrictions what is the point of this bet?
1) Curiosity as to how easy it is to double spend under unique conditions?
2) Trying to suggest that 0 conf payments are more secure than they are by placing these unrealistic restrictions?
3) Fine tuning a 0 conf approval algo?

I am ok with sacrificing more mining and node centralization as a temporary measure until layer 2 solutions get better tested but the fact that we have around ~2000 lite clients (without compact fraud proofs as originally intended in the whitepaper) to every 1 full node is disastrous.

Bandwidth speeds are increasing worldwide as quickly as in the past. Additionally, many ISPs are introducing softcaps on total bandwidth per month. Please verify yourself by looking at the data below.
Before advocating for larger blocksizes please plug in the numbers into this calculator and pay careful attention to the upload bandwidth needed with larger block sizes.
At 2MB you need at least 0.747Mbps upload speed . Keep in mind that most peoples upload speed is significantly lower than their download speed with their ISP.
Than look at what peoples upload speed is around the world:
Than realize this upload bandwidth must be shared with other users and other devices than running a full node.
Than keep in mind that these are averages including the higher speeds inside capital cities and large metropolitan areas and many people outside these areas have even lower speeds than the averages above.
Thus at
At 2MB blocks you need at least 0.747Mbps up
At 4MB you need at least 1.493Mbps up
So the questions you need to ask yourself are:
1) Is it ok to block whole countries from running full nodes?
2) Is it ok to block large regions within countries from running full nodes?
Segwit is already going to be preventing some people from running full nodes , to ask for larger blocks than 1.7 to 2MB at this point in time isn't a good idea.

You cannot just ignore the fact that there are many implementations, with completely different sets of devs , and tons of choice. Many people run different implementations as well. 




I see many different opinions in the bitcoin ecosystem. You think it is peaceful here? No, its contentious specifically because no one controls it and we don't all agree. 


I encourage anyone to run software they want. Developers in bitcoin don't choose the direction of bitcoin, users do. Right now there are many choices and the users are free to run whichever implementation they want.

xthin, compact blocks , and FIBRE help with propogation relay but wont effect these numbers at all. Remember, that a user still needs to send and receive all the data including signatures unless they are no longer 
are running a full unrestricted node.
Even running a restricted node the numbers don't look good for many countries as one needs to protect against worst case scenarios. In reality segwit isn't only 1.7MB to 2MB but can allow some 3MB and higher blocks to be generated thus nodes need to be prepared for these to occasionally occur(FYI a 3MB segwit block holds the similar amount of txs as a similar 3MB maxblocksize HF non segwit block) 
I am being very generous with these numbers as well because in all likelyhood a user will not want to saturate 100% other their bandwidth . 50% max is more realistic.

they don't , many stable coins exist , and more regulated exchanges have fiat pairs . Wash trading occurs with BTC to alts as well which is why I don't trust those numbers for btc either. Since btc/ustd is a subset of tether liquidity on exchanges than it will naturally make those wash trading numbers look higher... but than again wash trading occurs with fiat and other stable coins too.
Fiat wash trading has higher liquidity than tether if you want to consider wash trading as a useful way to measure liquidity

1) Segwit with a HF wasn't a priority until Luke Jr had the brilliant idea how it could be rolled out with a SF making it much safer and quicker to deploy than with a HF. This changed the priority to focus on segwit. 
2) If blacklisting started to become a thing I would want all devs to ignore any work on tx throughput and only focus on fungibility as fungibility is much more important. 
3) Satoshi's original idea of SPV clients was to couple them with Fraud Proofs for security. We have never had fraud proofs and it is doubtful a good solution will be found to this which in turn indicates that full nodes are much more secure than SPV nodes. If someone found a solution to fraud proofs than we as a community would be much more comfortable increasing the blocksize to a point which further centralizes full nodes to a degree.

Off chain and payment channels have existed since 2010. They are tested and proven. We aren't speaking about hypotheticals, If 15 pennies is too much for you than just do offchain or try and convince miners to adopt segwit.

Doing that would allow B Cash supporters to buy their tokens back at pennies on the dollar and it is more profitable for me to ensure they pay top dollar for 2 reasons : First to make more btc , second to drain them of resources.

Ok, I'll accept that , but this is always a moving target due to increasing P2SH, so perhaps 1.7 to 4MB blocks should be stated.

0.13.1 is actually quite quickly being adopted. one shouldnt expect a majority of nodes using 0.13.1 when segwit activates as nodes are typical slow to never be upgraded
@_date: 2016-11-15 12:11:22
This is bad advice because we never know when the next appreciating bubble will occur . The price could stagnate due to some people blocking segwit and uncertainty building . I don't think this will occur but you would be gambling.

Xthin helps , but not nearly as much as FIBRE + compact blocks which is far superior. Both don't solve the problem , just help mitigate it. 


If all the building is full with their latest ASICs it would equal 75% of worldwide mining power today. They would more than likely slowly fill it up and rent out space , and not all the ASIC's will be the latest generation.


No, its always a factor regardless the size on the mining pool/farm , this is why individual miners like to join larger pools. The factor is amplified the more centralized and larger the blocks are however.

It is too early to suggest it is inevitable. There is good evidence that the BU supporters are a really small group that may eventually give up by selling their coins, moving to an alt, or changing their mind when core's roadmap fulfills their dreams of p2p currency with LN wallets.

Unlikely to be trolls or haters because you need to invest real money in mining. Also I doubt state or bank outsiders even care about bitcoin enough now to disrupt it(we are still an insignificant gadfly to them that they are watching out of curiosity). 
I would suggest those mining B U are doing so primarily for these 2 reasons :
They are misled by a few people and emotionally invested in the narrative 
They want segwit but are trying to force a second compromise(which is going to fail as their bluff is so transparent and many of us are patient and fine with the status quo)

I have been watching that group for over 4 years. Being that most of them are early adopters and at least one of them(but likely multiple individuals) has a fortune in Bitcoin you should be aware of them. 
Their wealth alone will insure that a minority chain survives in the event of a HF. If we did want to hard fork the best we can hope for is somehow survey all nodes, miners, exchanges, devs, and users to see if 95% or higher agree and than the hard for will likely result in a 90% to 10% split like we see in ethereum. Simply allowing the miners to vote on a HF with insanely low numbers like 51%-75% will insure that the split will be much more even,.

completely false. 
First of all nodes take a very long time to upgrade. It has taken a year for 90% of nodes -  to become segwit compatible with one of many versions of core. There is absolutely no way 90% nodes would upgrade in 3 months even if core supported the silly segwit2x HF. 
Additionally , many users can and do think independently, and core devs would mainly lose credibility within our eyes if they supported segwit2x.

You are correct , you cannot guarantee placement in the next block but you can have a very high probability of getting in the next block with this using this setting to determine the appropriate fee-
estimatefee 1 
returns the fee estimated to result in confirmation within 1 block.
estimatefee is calculated in bitcoind locally based upon statistics in the mempool. Thus if some miners set an unreasonable high fee in a recently mined block(? not sure if a recent block needs to be mined or just enough miners need to request this)  than that could throw off the fee estimate into assuming that one would need to pay an unusually high fee to(most likely ) get in the next block

We should expect drama to increase as bitcoin's market cap grows, not decrease. It is reasonable to believe the evidence suggests the existing drama comes mainly from trolls, altpumpers and some genuine bitcoin users. Just wait till states start attacking bitcoin directly instead of mainly ignoring it and keeping a watchful eye. 
This is why core developers want to set a precedent where they 
aren't in control of bitcoins future and we need a very high degree of consensus for soft forks and almost everyone agreeing on hard forks to be a standard. They don't want to be targeted by states to manipulate the bitcoin protocol. Inevitably some will , or we will see some(or more) state paid developers attempting to change the direction of the protocol.

There is a chasm of difference between signalling for BIP91 and HF occurring in 2-3 months. I am not disputing their signalling. I am explaining the fact that it is extremely unlikely most economic nodes will switch to segwit2x in a short time period of 2-3 months . This isn't the way upgrades happen even if segwit2x was supported by core who the community trusts. 
These 100k nodes will reject the HF and block any nodes peering segwit2x blocks if a Hf ever occurs - 
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:36:14
Because they want to appear reasonable by suggesting a modest increase of 2MB with changing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant but in reality what they are after is 4MB to 8MB Blocks(what is the case with segwit+ 2MB HF) to start and than many more HF to keep rapidly increasing block bloat thereafter.

There is a difference between wanting regulation from states and feeling vindicated for the expected regulation. I am an ancap , but wasn't delusional enough to believe that states would not attack this ecosystem. It is fantastic news that the SEC keeps reinforcing the courts decisions that Bitcoin is not a security and it is also great news that Satoshi had the insight from many years of governments attacking private currencies to insure bitcoin is 100&amp; proof of work with no premine or token sale to insure it would not be considered a security. You are correct that the whole ecosystem will likely go into a bear market when a liquidity crunch occurs. Many oldtimers like myself playing the long game and don't care about getting rich quickly or lambos. We won't sacrifice bitcoin's security and a prolonged bear market is actually good for many reasons:
1. Bitcoin will do the best in such a bear market and when the market enters a bull phase more liquity will rush into bitcoin first
2. Instead of worrying about price and a speculative frenzy we can focus on fixing the many problems bitcoin has
3. more time for LN to develop , so we are prepared for the next speculative bubble
4. More time to buy cheaper coins
5. Prolong bear markets Clean out may corrupt companies, ponzis,  or scams
We have long time preferences and will do what it takes to make sure bitcoin remains secure regardless of the price swings.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:34:43
People with short time preferences will have a long opportunity for future regrets . Might be a good idea to spend or at least invest that fiat as well, as it will lose 45&amp; purchasing power in a mere 20 years. This is assuming USD remains the dominant currency as well with a mere 3&amp; average inflation which is the best case scenario so your definition of safe is a bit misguided as well. Perhaps sell your BTC and invest in a index fund that tracks the SP500 if you want safe , modest returns? There is nothing wrong with wanting a safer investment that sees 9.8&amp; and inflation vs a riskier investment like bitcoin with much higher returns but calling holding fiat "safe" reflects a deep misunderstanding of investment. You should have 3\-12 months of living expenses in fiat for emergencies , more than that is not wise.

sure. If segwit2x goes off and ignores most nodes and HF to a 8MB block limit than they could attack the minority chain by splitting off some of their hashrate.
If this occurs it is advisable to wait for a short time period, not tx, and continue to invalidate their blocks as this would be a 51% attack.  If this attack continued than a PoW change would be needed. Anything less than 15% is dangerous to tx on for a minority chain using the same SHA256 PoW algo
But again , this has nothing to do with the longest chain , but most cumulative worked chain

Why would we need a hard fork? Since the community seems to be fine avoiding the capacity upgrade doubling the blocksize and throughput there seems no urgency in even discussing any HF to do the same. The status quo appears to be fine. If segwit is activated and we need more capacity than we can discuss the next steps for on the chain scaling.
I would highly suggest all developers and users to not even entertain any 2nd compromise at this moment as segwit is already a large compromise and the community appears fine delaying it which is strong evidence that all this urgency was a bunch of hot air..

Here is the data to backup my claims- 
Before advocating for larger blocksizes please plug in the numbers into this calculator and pay careful attention to the upload bandwidth needed with larger block sizes. 
At 2MB you need at least 0.747Mbps upload speed . 
Keep in mind that most peoples upload speed is significantly lower than their download speed with their ISP.
Than look at what peoples upload speed is around the world: 
Than realize this upload bandwidth must be shared with other users and other devices than running a full node.
Than keep in mind that these are averages including the higher speeds inside capital cities and large metropolitan areas and many people outside these areas have even lower speeds than the averages above. 
Thus at 
At 2MB blocks you need at least 0.747Mbps up
At 4MB you need at least 1.493Mbps  up
So the questions you need to ask yourself are:
1) Is it ok to block whole countries from running full nodes?
2) Is it ok to block large regions within countries from running full nodes?
Segwit is already going to be preventing some people from running full nodes , to ask for larger blocks than 1.7 to 2MB at this point in time isn't a good idea.

According to legal case law and the Howey test it matters greatly. Proof of work was one of the main reasons why bitcoin was deemed to not be a security in the  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  v.
TRENDON T. SHAVERS AND BITCOIN SAVINGS AND TRUST case.
Here is the Howey test:
1. **It is an investment of money**  \-\-\- *With proof of work you don't need to invest in money , you can burn electricity. Any token sale forces one to invest in the sale with currency.*
2. **There is an expectation of profits from the investment** \- *Was there insinuation that the token*s sold will go up in value\*?
3. **The investment of money is in a common enterprise** \- *Proof of work removes a centralized company from issuing the token. Anybody can create the token freely with electricity*
4. **Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party** \- *There is no centralized promoter or third party with Bitcoin or a proof of work open source project unlike all these token sales who are fundraising in order to create a dev and marketing budget to promote their security*

Perhaps , but not likely. It is more likely that an increase to 4, 8 , or even 20MB would quickly be consumed and txs and fees would be still 2-7 pennies which is unsuitable for micro txs. There are a ton of business right now who would love to use the ledger for time stamping purposes where they weren't aware or intrested in bitcoin in 2012 and before. 


Luke has been clear for advocating for a blocksize increase with segwit but just advocates for miners to temporarily mine smaller blocks as a safety precaution. I think that 1.7 to 2MB is pushing the limits but is fine for miners to mine. 


This is silly. The devs have absolutely no control over the miners (as evidenced by 2 miners immediately breaking the contract ) and no control over what software you choose to run. Increase the blocksize for all we care on your nodes/miners, just don't force us to follow you.

Miner signalling is different than node signalling. Why are you conflating the 2? Most miners understand that a majority of those signalling for XT/Classic/BU would like segwit and are merely holding out as a negotiating wedge. I hear BU/classic proponents beg all the time for a 2nd compromise asking for (segwit plus a 2MB HF or segwit as a HF). Thus if miners do decide to to activate segwit with only 85% of nodes running core they aren't technically betraying the supermajority of users desires.

You have this backwards. Most users don't have much of an opinion and just follow specialists (I'm not saying this is a good thing, as I would prefer users to be educated, but just is the reality we face and unlikely to change because its a matter of human nature and psychology.) Most specialists are pro core roadmap and in overwhelming numbers, from the thousand+ developers to oracles like Andreas, to owners of the most popular bitcoin websites. Therefore the crowd will likely follow them. All the evidence thus far supports this as well , from looking at activity numbers of live users, to content, to polls of developers, to node count, to blocks mined, ect... 
Than the next largest group is those that understand the details and support core. 
Than is a very small group of vocal supporters of big blocks at any cost. 
The smallest group (but very wealthy old timers )are those that follow MP and  and they are extremely conservative and basically want no changes , not even segwit, and will definitely avoid any HF at all costs .

Using nLocktime or CLTV too far into the future is dangerous because hardforks or potential quantum computers can make these locked btc vulnerable. Thus setting a CLTV more than 1 year into the future isn't advisable.

The hostile party can keep the status quo if they continue to burn 6% or higher hash power (variance) to block SF's. A hostile party can block HF with the combined effort of sybil nodes, hashpower and shill accounts. All this does is keep the status quo, which isn't the end of the world because bitcoin will continue to grow and improve on different layers while the delay occurs. There are so many other tasks we can focus on improving that don't involve the consensus layer so we are OK.

Bitcoin is a decentralized public ledger that allows people to securely transfer value in a private way that cannot be censored. Bitcoin is a sovereign currency.


It exists in the software that everyone runs which comes to consensus 


Like any asset, gold or fiat currency, the value comes from what people are willing to place on it and exchanges with trading pairs BTC/USD or BTC/GOLD are examples help determine exact price. Bitcoin is valuable because it is scarce and very useful. 


Bitcoin is legal in most countries. In the USA courts have already determined it is not an illegal security , and the IRS considers it an asset where capital gains taxes applies


Bearer assets like Bitcoin and gold have very different security assumptions than registered value like fiat. Bitcoin is certainly more secure than walking around with cash or gold however. One must understand because Bitcoin is nowhere near as liquid as USD or Euros, it is much more volatile. This means that you can buy it short term to use to save money like 15% off amazon, but if you plan on investing you should also have a fiat savings account because bear markets can last a little over a year at times. Also keep in mind that the cryptocurrency ecosystem is filled with scams and con artists trying to take your Bitcoin because its more private and transactions are generally non reversable unlike fiat so be very careful and skeptical.

changing maxBlockSize to = 4000000  is much different than segwit and much more dangerous as it doesn't solve the problems with UTXO bloat , quadratic scaling of sighash operations, and give these benefits that segwit provides :
Additionally, changing maxBlockSize will require a HF which will almost definitely split the chain in 2 coins which we may avoid simply by focusing on the chain scaling with SF's like MAST, Schnorr sigs , extension blocks , ect... and layer 2 solutions like LN. 
So no, they aren't anything like each other as you seem to imply.

You are in luck, Segwit does raise the blocksize!

Additionally, any HF with a low threshold of 75% miner only vote would split the community in 2.

I don't agree with this statement. There is strong evidence to reflect otherwise as well. Segwit not being quickly adopted is a bit of the evidence and users are willing to pay extremely high premiums on the spot price of BTC shows that 12 pennies per tx isn't a major concern. 


You are correct , as many models reflect that raising capacity and the blocksize can decrease miners profits due to less of a tx fee market but this will likely be temporary as I expect segwit blocks to quickly fill and that fee market to be recreated for the benefit of miners and users.


Core is committed to on the chain scaling , but one should not "trust" them. I don't trust them as "leaders" or "authority figures" and have come to my own conclusions after reviewing the data that their roadmap is best for bitcoin and we should avoid any unnecessary hard forks where better solutions can be rolled out with soft forks. 


There is a false impression that there is a sense of urgency from many pro segwit to activate segwit quickly. I see some hints of that , but also see many individuals who don't want any blocksize increase that segwit creates and are fine with the status quo, and other individuals who have a ton of work on their plate and are perfectly happy working on fungibility and other tasks like improving the wallets for the next year or longer if needed.  
Personally, I respect the right to choose to block segwit, and urge core and most users not to consider lowering the threshold or make a second compromise(Haven't seen any evidence of this being even considered). Lets allow the free market to decide as a supermajority and when it wants more capacity it will choose to upgrade to segwit.*
*I'm not mentioning more capacity with BU as their support is atrociously low in block signalling, node count and user support.

It is indeed technically true that Core correctly suggests when a certain miner demands a high fee it becomes the set rate to guarantee to get in the next block because even if a mining pool had only 2% of the hashpower there is still a 2% probability that they could find the next block. 
Perhaps you could redefine priority txs to be in included in the first 2 blocks and normal txs to be within 3 blocks to prevent a single miner from manipulating the fees?
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:09:09
**Exactly.** The Cipher punks and crypto anarchists wrestled with this problem for many years when regulators shutdown many of their previous projects  before bitcoin was invented (liberty dollar, digicash, egold, ect...)
Everyone focuses on the "Block Chain" as being the innovation when Blocks are merely a consequence of Proof of Work.  The only reason Blocks within a Blockchain exist is specifically because  the Poisson process used in proof of work. There is no need to batch  together transactions in blocks without this as doing so merely ads  latency which is completely unnecessary as one can merely  cryptographically link together a chain of transactions if one wanted to  .  The innovation of satoshi and Bitcoin was linking together the right incentives and game theory with Proof of work.

Bitcoin will likely absorb some of the value in ethereum (which is why I suggest Bitcoin will fair the best) as many seek safe harbor, but the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem is often correlated where liquidity tends to run for fiat in general when uncertainty or regulatory oversight occurs.

Forcing all users within countries and continents to either use a 40 dollar or higher VPS or severely restrict their node with 8 MB isn't clean. Splitting the network in 2 coins with a 51/49% or 75/25% split isn't clean either. 
Before advocating for larger blocksizes please plug in the numbers into this calculator and pay careful attention to the upload bandwidth needed with larger block sizes. 
At 2MB you need at least 0.747Mbps upload speed . 
Keep in mind that most peoples upload speed is significantly lower than their download speed with their ISP.
Than look at what peoples upload speed is around the world: 
Than realize this upload bandwidth must be shared with other users and other devices than running a full node.
Than keep in mind that these are averages including the higher speeds inside capital cities and large metropolitan areas and many people outside these areas have even lower speeds than the averages above. 
Thus at 
At 2MB blocks you need at least 0.747Mbps up
At 4MB you need at least 1.493Mbps  up
So the questions you need to ask yourself are:
1) Is it ok to block whole countries from running full nodes?
2) Is it ok to block large regions within countries from running full nodes?
Segwit is already going to be preventing some people from running full nodes , to ask for larger blocks than 1.7 to 2MB at this point in time isn't a good idea.
8 MB requires 2.987Mbps up minimum for 8 peers unrestricted. 
I see many countries in this list with average upload speeds lower than this , and even if you look at peak speeds in capital cities you have to consider that home users cannot use all of their bandwidth for their home node as they have multiple users and devices sharing the uplink.
Lets take one of many examples and drive down on the evidence to only focus on the speeds in a capital city-
 1.3MB upload ... so even if one would to use 100% of the bandwidth it couldn't handle the above.
Here is another capital city -
 588kbps up
Almost the whole continent of Africa would be forced to use a VPS as well. Wow!
Also I don't agree we should force all nodes offline outside of capital cities either, but even if we consider the whole country you would be forcing users to rent VPS's in many countries or severely limit their full node.

Hardware wallets can be used with cell phones and you can verify the address from other devices as well outside the infected computer. HW wallets also prevent other attacks as well. 


One reason OSs like TAILs or Qubes are so secure is simply because the users running them are more security minded and don't install a lot of unknown programs. Yes, there are other reasons as well , but the weakest link is typically the user in security.

A Soft Served hard fork doesn't easily fit into either category. It is similar to a soft fork in the sense that it merely takes a majority of miners/hash rate to initiate the change(miners can orphan blocks from the minority hashrate but the more miners onboard the better), but is more akin to a hard fork in the sense that eventually all users would need to upgrade their full nodes or they would be stuck on a chain that cannot be used. A soft served Hard fork is a means that would allow an upgrade without everyone being forced to change software on the same day (Because Bitcoin is very decentralized this would be a nightmare)

Roger Is missing the point here. I am suggesting Roger , and all the companies and the ecosystem as whole have been ignoring efficient scaling through payment channels because there was plenty of blockspace available. The reason Roger or Blockchain.info didn't hire Matt is because it was in their business interest to continue to externalize the costs of txs on the network. Now that a tx fee market exists the transactions fees are partly being paid by the people responsible for making them giving an incentive to everyone to fix this underlying problem within bitcoin. Roger wants to keep delaying this event but it must come one day or another and the longer we put it off the worse we are off.

IMHO ETH is indeed a security , but I likely see a situation where they treat it slightly different and simply lay a massive fine on the creators and the ethereum foundation instead . This is due to the massive 72 million premine being a security and subsequent pow making it less security like.

No BTC is volatile even with other trading pairs like GOLD/BTC. 


If there was a BTC/Egg trading pair Bitcoin would be just as volatile as BTC/USD. Not understanding this reflects a deep misunderstanding of how the CPI is calculated. The CPI is fairly accurate despite any small flaws as evident over the purchasing power of the dollar over many years. Some simply math can quickly verify this
Bitcoin doesn't have to remain volatile but at minimum needs a much higher market cap to compare to the stability of gold or many fiat currencies

Market cap is extremely misleading because most of these coins are premined ICOs where the founders and initial investors temporarily hold onto most the liquidity unlike pure PoW coins with no premine. 


If you care about hard money and digital scarcity (main reason BTC was created in the first place) than don't or at minimum only invest in the altcoin you trust and stick with that . Your other investments should be outside of the cryptocurrency ecosystem because they are uncorrelated which is the whole point in creating a diversified portfolio. You don't reduce your risk by investing an a ton of scam coins that are all likely going to fail or at least heavily capitulate.

Yes, open dime allows better privacy and unlimited txs. 
There are many scenarios where this is useful, lets take 2 examples of bitcoins key demographic users-
1) A group of friends and acquaintances get together weekly for high stakes texas holdem poker and since they are dealing with larger sums of btc and sometimes dealing with acquaintances and even sometimes strangers they prefer to use open dimes instead of chips/coins . Since debts and balances switch back and forth often as players win and lose large amounts each week the open dimes quickly pay for themselves and are easier to settle at the end of the night without having to wait for a confirmation and offer better privacy for their illegal games. 
2) Buying large amounts of drugs for distributors makes open dimes great as 12 USD for instant and private tx is really a great deal under such circumstance

Ethereum has a massive premine that the devs likely bought into the crowdsale as well.
1) Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and was previously involved in a quantum mining scam right before starting ethereum.
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time noobs are misled into believing ETH is decentralized.

Where the UX can improve is with receiving BTC on a lightning wallet. It is very easy with custodial LN wallets 
like Blue wallet and others but with eclair you must start to open channels and spend BTC before getting any inbound liquidity and this is what can confuse some people.
I think the ultimate solution to this is to have a hybrid wallet which is custodial and non custodial for new users where they instantly get inbound liquidity to start but as they open channels the wallet switches to non custodial and does not need to use any custodial inbound liquidity feature for a more seamless UX

It would be less misleading if we focused on % in volatility. -2.61 % is what occurred, which is normal for many stocks. 
Compared to USD it is volatile. Compared for currencies like the bolívar it is very stable. Bitcoin stability right now is akin to a small cap security which indicates that it has indeed grown much more secure/stable over the years.

You are creating a false dichotomy. I want a strong layer 0 that acts as a settlement network with very large on the chain tx fees, and other layers like payment channels that have extremely high volume and pass on a bulk of the fees to settle on layer 0. When people use payment channels like the LN they will have very small fees 1-5 pennies and there will be extremely high volume , the code that developers are testing right now is already doing 2000 TPS bidirectionally and be able to provide us with secure instant confirmations instead of insecure 0 confirmation txs. 
 When you do the math scaling everything onchain doesn't make sense and leads to a version of bitcoin that is centralized, bloated , inefficient and still cant perform as many transactions per second as using payment channels. 
This means that the blocksize on layer 0 will continue to grow but at a much slower rate than you probably desire.

Let us keep repeating this to be 100% clear. LN is absolutely working right now in a testnet, including simple routing. LN will likely come out in 2017 if segwit activates quickly. LN won't likely start to be used by regular users for at least 6 months if not 1 year. 
This is absolutely fine, as segwit gives plenty of breathing room with 1.7 to 2.2MB averages ... yes, we will see block averages above 1.7 --   and if people don't keep distracting the developers with nonsense we will likely see MAST and Schnorr sigs increasing onchain capacity in 2017 as well.

If most UTXOs are tainted than exchanges will just be forced to scale back how many hops they do chain analysis(or give a taint % analysis) or risk banning 100% of their clients. Privacy coins will have an assumption that they are 100% tainted as we see from the link I provided. Bitcoin has a better chance to skirt outright bans because there is enough plausible deniability where you can withdraw or deposit from an non blacklisted address to satisfy regulators. You could be making the suggestion that regulators will simply ban all cryptocurrency altogether which is indeed a possibility, albeit with large institutions adopting Bitcoin this is becoming increasingly unlikely.

With enough of a technical background you can properly vet any projects claims to see if a project is being marketed honestly or not. Those of us who have done this work should inform others and help them become more educated. Not all projects are scams. Some are pointless, some are interesting, some are well intentioned but destined to fail due to not providing an efficiency, and others simply have misaligned incentives.


What? Many altcoins/ICOs have lost over 95% of their value in a couple years... far more than stable fiat being devalued at 2-3% a year.


This is simply not true and the main problem. Have you properly done an analysis of the security tradeoffs and assumptions between registered value and bearer assets?

You can get these figures from tx amounts(Bcash's blockchain is dead when you review the blocks) and estimates suggest that between 40-60 % of Bcash has even been claimed or split which causes unnatural scarcity artificially increasing the price of that alt. 


It cannot be avoided . Most of the reason people invest in altcoins is because bitcoin is "expensive" and these people want to get rich quick with  pump and dump "penny stock" altcoins.

Great, lets keep bitcoin lean and efficient and those wanting to add timestamps on the blockchain and consolidate their hashes so they only pay one fee instead of many. Increasing the blocksize to much will remove the motivation to use the blockchain in a efficient manner as many businesses are also motivated to keep the timestamps distinct for better granularity and to allow clients to use public block explorers to reference distinct txs.

**Bech32 (Addresses that start with BC1)**
Pros -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~36-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
Pros -
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
Cons -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32
**Legacy Addresses (some addresses that start with 1)**
**Pros** - None
**Cons** - 
1) 26 -58% higher fees than using a segwit transaction for the same priority
2) larger txs than segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32

Why do you assume this? I see strong economic pressures for some mining farms to remove all softlimits to take advantage of block propagation latency which will further centralize mining.   Have you see Bitmains new proposed mining center which can store enough ASICs to match up to 75% of current hash power? If you don't rent from there you will have a huge issues propagating larger blocks in a timely matter outside of the LAN in that facility.  


In 2010 we were still mining on CPUs. In 2011 GPU's became a thing and it wasn't till 2013 that ASICs started to come out and at that time the softlimit of 750kbps was being lifted. Therefore the mining topography was completely different during those periods.

This is a valid concern longterm but completely exaggerated short term. Not going to be a large problem in our lifetimes. There is going to be a slow transition where certain sectors get automated and new job categories are created. 


Example - IT tech teams that repair all of the automated fast food machines for the smarter young employees. For the older , lower IQ employees working in retail and fast food they will have to move onto other trades that cannot be automated like construction or handiman/repair/plumbing/electrician/pestcontrol /mechanic/ect... 
Higher efficiencies allow for more disposable income in these other sectors.

Bitcoin developers are typically at the forefront of development and altcoins typically copy the work from Bitcoin. Sometimes altcoins will release some features before Bitcoin but it will usually be unfinished work created by Bitcoin developers (like we see in Schnorr Signatures recently). Other times altcoins will use work created and discarded by Bitcoin developers because they don't meet the standards of Bitcoin and have unreasonable tradeoffs.
It is a complete fallacy to insinuate that Bitcoin is not on the forefront technically when you look at examples like simplicity, betterhash, taproot, graftroot , musig, MAST, Schnorr sigs, CT, minisketch, dandelion, and many more examples. Altcoins are better off marketing their differences because they operate more like a centralized company with a marketing budget funded by a premine to fool the credulous

Businesses simple will raise the cost of goods and services, decrease the product size, and/or not hire more people to make up for this higher burden which will directly effect the poor and middle class. 


This will mainly benefit the wealthy as less a % of their budget needs to pay VAT, they can more easily avoid paying VAT, They can make purchases in jurisdictions without VAT easier.
I understand Yang suggests there will be slight differences in VAT depending upon if the item is luxury or not, but the wealthy have creative ways of avoiding these taxes. I.E... If you charge a 15% VAT on yachts the wealthy can simply have their yachts purchased and or registered in a country that does not have the jurisdiction where this high VAT is imposed. 
As a general rule the more complicated and byzantine you make taxes the harder it will be for the lower and middleclass to avoid them and the greater burden in time and resources it will be to comply with these taxes and the greater administration inefficiencies will occur. It will be easier for the wealthy to have an advantage over the other classes in tax avoidance as well. 
If anything one should be proposing simplifying and reducing taxes and not taking away privacy from small business owners that can be stolen by corrupt government employees , outside hackers , or bribes from the wealthy.

Lets assume that tx fees were 1-2 pennies as an example to make the best case for users wanting to spend their BTC on coffee.
Bitcoin still needs to compete with debit/credit cards in many locations that have these features that encourage spending with merchants - 
1) Usually attached to more stable currencies, Bitcoin is still more volatile than most fiat 
2) Included insurance and other protections like chargebacks
3) Cashback or reward points 
4) More familiar to use and often times easier to onramp
5) Ability to spend money they don't have on loan automatically (credit)

Most users (for good and bad consequences) don't have much of an understanding or care with this whole debate. Their decision making process is more emotionally driven like the elections. They want bitcoin to be secure and continue to gain in value. Because of this many will simply follow the advice and guidance of oracles and specialists. Personally, I would much prefer they took the time to understand why segwit is great but can also empathize with the fact that most people don't have the time to do the many hours of research.
 An overwhelming majority of specialists and oracles support segwit. This means that segwit will indeed activate eventually because the pressure from the userbase will continue to grow and the miners won't be able to ignore this.

Before advocating for larger blocksizes please plug in the numbers into this calculator and pay careful attention to the upload bandwidth needed with larger block sizes. 
At 2MB you need at least 0.747Mbps upload speed . 
Keep in mind that most peoples upload speed is significantly lower than their download speed with their ISP.
Than look at what peoples upload speed is around the world: 
Than realize this upload bandwidth must be shared with other users and other devices than running a full node.
Than keep in mind that these are averages including the higher speeds inside capital cities and large metropolitan areas and many people outside these areas have even lower speeds than the averages above. 
Thus at 
At 2MB blocks you need at least 0.747Mbps up
At 4MB you need at least 1.493Mbps  up
So the questions you need to ask yourself are:
1) Is it ok to block whole countries from running full nodes?
2) Is it ok to block large regions within countries from running full nodes?
Segwit is already going to be preventing some people from running full nodes , to ask for larger blocks than 1.7 to 2MB at this point in time isn't a good idea.

Bitcoin is definitely more risky than gold but you reduce your risk by reducing your exposure to risky asset classes and hedging. Gold simply isn't a useful investment anymore because smuggling gold is much more risky than Bitcoin. 


Than we can fix the bug and move on. Also if SHA-256 is exploited than we will have much larger problems in society to deal with than Bitcoin. 


I was one of these people, but no longer. In an extreme SHTF black swan scenario gold would be very low on the list of useful currencies as well. Bullets, medicine, and food are much more useful. The writing is on the wall with Precious metals as well too because the market is going to start pricing in the diluted future value of Gold and other PMs in 2026 when NASA lands on the PM asteroid Psyche


Disagree with all of this. Bitcoin is as fungible as gold and a much better medium of exchange than gold. Bitcoin is more "durable" than gold as well if proper backups are made. 


Why do I need a store of value when my portfolio is hedged? I want investments that are uncorrelated to hedge for any outcome. Gold is a horrible investment and after 2026 will become a much worse store of value

(But perhaps you mean non human oracle) . If This is the case than CLTV is indeed a "smart contract" but I don't like to conflate that term as many use it to refer to more complicated AI/contracts  that is insecure.

It is not the Java language itself that I have a problem with (this can be written as secure as any other language) but the fact that one will need to depend upon java plugins or out of date java software on the local computer. Oracle has a long history of leaving 0 day exploits on the table as well for extended periods of time so many of us simply prefer to uninstall Java altogether.

I have a feeling that with each passing day that the possibility of a planned HF is becoming increasing more and more impossible. Bitcoins main selling point is quickly becoming an immutable , stable , secure blockchain that is backwards compatible and a HF undermines this. 
We will continue to scale , but it is likely that it will be with softforks, sidechains, extension blocks, payment channels only.

If one waits around forever for the big selloff they may never buy BTC , therefore it is important to buy at market price and place your limit buy orders in for the dips. Buying at market price also helps create a new floor or support.

What is wrong with preferring a different set of ideals? 
Ethereum is set to turn into PoS, something Bitcoin users know is insecure while Rootstock will be merge mined. 
Ethereum breaks the contract of disinflation with a 21 million limit while rootstock allows bitcoin owners to maintain this and thus avoid diluting the value of their currency. 
Ethereum is inflationary for ever, Bitcoin/thus rootstock is disinflationary till 2140 than has 0 inflation. 
Ethereum is much more centralized while rootstock will be less so.

I am older than you probably assume and have traveled a lot and mostly lived outside the USA. Connection speeds will slowly improve but not nearly as fast as in densely populated areas in US and Europe. This is simply a fact that it isn't cost effective for ISPs to run fiber even if I bribed them with 50k USD. The reason is because many countries have communities that are between 20-300 houses. Therefore infrastructure will take at least 5-10 years because the population needs to grow that quickly. Cell towers dont help much either , because even though they are installing 4G LTE here it isn't much faster as they aren't installing enough towers to handle the speeds needed because it doesn't make business sense to do so with lower populations. 
 &gt; Beside that your millionaires/neighborhood could put sth like 1m$+ together, pretty sure you could get decent connection for that.
You have got to be kidding, talk about rising the costs of being able to run a full node. It isn't just about my ability to run a full node either. I believe BU is fundamentally broken because it leads to mining and node centralization with floating block limits and has no future thus will not follow it for any reason. The fact that I personally cannot run a full node from home with very large blocks is only a small part of the evidence I am putting forward. Look at all the data I am providing from countries and ISP's worldwide. I would rather invest that money in ASIC miners or bitcoin than getting a faster internet connection.

3-4MB occasional blocks are fine because the more critical aspect segwit solves for security is reducing UTXO bloat and removing quadratic sighash scaling. This is why segwit changes the calculation from blocksize into "blockweight" to better account for resource costs. Understanding, this puts everything into perspective as to why the blocksize limit post segwit isn't a static number like it is now and why 4MB blocks under segwit are much safer than simply changing maxBlockSize to 4MB.
Yet , I understand your skepticism with increasing capacity at all. Segwit making blocksizes 1.7- 2MB on average is a great sacrifice for capacity in order to satisfy those that are disgruntled. There are good arguments to be had for miners to reduce blocksizes with a softlimit to 750kb

This is due to attacking liquidity of these nodes and doesn't take into account the benefits of AMP to route sufficient liquidity around these nodes.

There is no way to know if they are false signalling or just running a custom version of BU, this is why I merely said "likely" , the reason I said likely is because it is extremely dangerous to run mostly untested implementations if you are a large mining pool (we all saw when Bu forked off classic in testnet) and I doubt they are this reckless.

A little context here for new users. Stephen's post was filled with not only misleading statements but outright lies . Segwit2x was a contentious HF proposal that had 8 million units of weight or up to 7.4MB max block size and not an increase to 2MB. Signatures are in blocks and the code doesn't make a distinction between "base" limits and signature limits as being separate categories or seperate blocks.
Segwit2x supporters were often lying by suggesting they were being reasonable by merely doubling the limit when what they were trying to do was more akin to 4x the limit(100% segwit txs would create blocks ~4MB in average  size and 7.4MB max with segwit2x, not 2MB)

I have seen recent handwaiving that segwit doesn't increase blocksize either because the blocksize is simply defined by the limit constant you to linked as well. 
This goes beyond bike shedding and either represents dishonest manipulation or an extreme level of ignorance from those individuals. 
Whether or not that constant is ever changed or a majority Hard fork will occur is unknown. I do see some honest attempts to conduct a hard fork from Peter Todd and Luke Jr. The problem I see is many over in r/btc appear to interpret their actions as stalling because they have lower standards of security than core devs or simply aren't aware of all the dangers with a hard fork.

Appears that very few people oppose segwit upon closer inspection. If Segwit was offered in combination with the change of MAX_BLOCK_SIZE to something higher they would quickly jump at the opportunity. The Whole blocking of segwit and claim that they don't have an official position on segwit is merely an attempt to try and force a 2nd compromise with the blocksize. Thus they aren't opposed to segwit in principle but merely using it as a negotiation tool. This attempt will fail because we are patient and don't need for segwit to activate as the status quo is also fine.

Good point, although there is enough entropy within a single language and derivation path of BIP39 and IMHO it would be better UX to simply have one standard and more entropy(24 words instead of 12 or 18) 
I believe the main reason for this inconsistency is simply due to the fact that Bitcoin is always changing, many wallets support multiple altcoins, open source and decentralization cause people to create their own standards based upon preferences. 
I really don't know of any solution to this UX nightmare other than have certain wallets accept any backup standard and than attempt to find the right version without much human involvement. Electrum allows their own standard + BIP39 but the UX fails because the user has to know they have a BIP39 backup and check it to import the backup seed. 
We really need wallets to be designed for people below average intelligence before we are ready to go mainstream.

Yeah , many of us don't notice the need for recording a derivation path because we are constantly upgrading our wallets and backups. When I help users recover their backups from years ago and they don't even remember the wallet they used than this becomes a big issue because some wallet backups become obsolete and address types/accounts/passphrases change which is why recording the derivation path is important along with the seed +potential passphrase
From a UX standpoint a passphrase added to BIP39 should be sufficient enough for the multiple accounts to address privacy and security considerations
I am not advocating for a unified standard because dealing with open source for many years I know this is impossible(There is no way Thomas will adopt BIP39 for electrum as a default and for some valid reasons), which is why I think ultimately beginner wallets need to intelligently figure out the backup standard in the backend to not confuse users . This really reflects how much work we need to do because I'm not aware of a single wallet that does this.

I see this happen all the time. Where it gets trickier is when they are older than 50 however.  


Say you are upper middle class and own 5 franchise fast food stores and decide to automate which allows you to get rid of 30% of your employees for a more efficient self serve machines that take orders and can process more people at once. The customers are happy because they either get cheaper food or quicker service. This increases productivity (which is one of the most important methods of increases a societies standard of living and not to be feared). Now its a shame that 30% of your employees have to find other work but now there are more positions in higher paying jobs that build, program, market, and maintain the machines you installed that did not exist before. Also , now that you have an extra 30k USd a year from saving on employees (Subtract human labor from the cost of machines and their upkeep) you go ahead and decide to renovate your vacation home and hire a bunch of blue collar construction workers to do the plumbing , electrical , and construction. You would have never done this renovation unless you had that saving from greater efficiency. After your vacation home has another extension put on its value appreciates and you need to pay more local taxes that help roads , schools , libraries , police and other resources which everyone benefits from. 
You see how this helps everyone?

Developers and miners do not decide, economic users ultimately do, and I want nothing to do with a HF that you suggest. Activation will never be reached for at least 1 year on a HF and when a HF does occur it will likely include much more HF wishlist items or flexcap. We have so much work to do with Schnorr sigs, MAST, LN  first that should be our priority.

lightning is instant and you cannot compare the security onchain of Bitcoin vs alts as one is much more secure and the time it takes to find a block is tied to this security(why exchanges require more confirmations for altcoins)

I'm in no hurry to activate segwit , and perfectly fine seeing them slowly become irrelevant. I'm not threatened by them and they hold little bargaining power because it is very clear that most miners(more miners are signalling for segwit than BU), developers, users, and economic users support the core roadmap.

I mine a bit as well. I don't see how it is relevant however as the more important aspect is how many bitcoins I own and how many future bitcoins I will buy on which chain. Miners follow profits.

It is a joke that doesn't make sense because Bitcoin has checksums so a typo won't send it to a wrong address and the amount paid in tx fee has nothing to do with the dollar value of BTC sent. The weight/size and priority of the tx determines the cost of the fee, not how many millions of dollars worth of BTC sent. A tx fee of sending 50 usd of BTC can be higher than 10 million of BTC if that 50 dollars if filled with dust.

You are discussing merge mined sidechains. There are also federated ones. 


More like break even mining on p2pool for many which isn't too much to ask if we really want to activate segwit. Additionally, we can always create a segwit pool that has 0 fees and donates the txs fees to miners. This isn't ideal but far better than the "orphan attack"

**Step 2 Buy BTC and transfer it to your personal wallet**- If you are in the USA than the best way to buy BTC is with cash app -

As long as you backup your hardware wallet with a 12 or 24 word seed and keep that secure you are fine. This is all part of the normal setup process and isn't hard. Thus hardware wallets make it easy for non technical people who get viruses on a regular basis to secure large amounts of btc. Place the backup seed (paper) in a secure place that cannot easily be stolen or damaged and you are done. All of your money can be recovered with the seed if your hardware wallet gets stolen or damaged.
Store a couple hundred on a cell phone wallet like copay, greenaddress, mycelium , and the rest on a hardware wallet for savings. Never invest your btc in ICO, cloud mining, alts , investment schemes, ect as well. Never leave large amounts on exchanges or online wallets either.

Use native segwit , so you have lower fees. Using a legacy address is pointless as it simply means slower confirmations and higher fees.  Under the gear icon on top right &gt; click experimental features &gt; Native segwit to allow bech32 addresses as well which are even better , but you may want to also use a regular p2sh segwit account because some businesses have not upgraded to accept the newest address types. 
**Bech32 (Addresses that start with BC1)**
Pros -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~36-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
Pros -
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
Cons -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32
**Legacy P2PKH Addresses (addresses that start with 1)**
Pros - none 
Cons-  slower confirmations and higher tx fees , bloats the blockchain unnecessarily

Running a full node by itself doesn't really do much except perhaps assist some new nodes bootstrap Bitcoin(If its an archival listening  full node) . If you want to help Your own security and privacy than run an economic full node where all your transactions full validate the rules.
This is Typically done with Electrum Personal Server + Hardware wallet(Ledger or trezor) + Electrum
 
For best privacy you can run electrum personal server and tor
What you want to do is setup a direct SSH tunnel-
Here is a guide to setup electrum personal server -
Your home ISP uplink will not be able to see anything but encrypted data. If you are even more paranoid you can host the EPS(Electrum Personal Server) at home or your own cabinet with your own server in a datacenter
Electrum works with ledger and trezor hardware wallets as well.
Blockstream Green might be a simpler setup as it allows for you to use tor and your own personal full node.

I prefer "dumb contracts" personally.... like CLTV and CSV, but we shouldn't assume there is no potential use case for "smart contracts".  I am highly dubious however as it is hard to fathom what utility it will have. 
I have to strain myself to imagine a use case but the best I have come up with is a decentralized exchange that facilitated cross atomic swaps within the contract for altcoin trading on RSK. This doesn't interest me much however as I don't see much use for alts in general. 
Another use case is it could open a way for projects like OB and dropzone to use extra space and not be limited to 80 bytes in OP_RETURN, but who knows... 
I am skeptical but at least it isn't an ICO.

Respectfully disagree. 
Privacy and anonymity is never absolute or 100% but a spectrum. Even physical cash has serial numbers that are recorded with OCR money counters with bank deposit and tracked by organizations like the FBI. Bitcoin is not anonymous but "pseudonymous" which essentially means you get to choose to being private , transparent or a mixture of the 2 depending upon what wallet you use. This is why most transactions on the dark net market are still done with Bitcoin despite privacy coins existing and why you have coin analytic employees admitting Bitcoin can be extremely private like here-


I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning, or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi) than the base layer because:
1)	The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain. With certain privacy coins like monero their inflation resistance relies faith in the future of ECC security which might need to be upgraded in the future thus casting serious doubts on an inflation bug existing undetected. 
2)	It is important to give users the option of transparency and audibility onchain, at least for accounts they choose to expose. 
3)	In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
It is far more likely they outlaw or restrict privacy coins (because they choose to market themselves as a privacy coin onchain instead of just giving users the option of privacy on wallets and other layers) as you can see here


4)	privacy  tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs and much higher resource demands leading to more centralization and greater inefficiencies. 
5) Schnorr/MAST incentives most wallets to coinjoin because coinjoin txs become cheaper than regular onchain transactions and lightning is designed to be extremely private from the get go. There is still an option to have transparency and give the allusion to regulators that they can track coins onchain however. 
6) Coinjoin with a wallet is private enough, Look at what an employee of leading coinanalytics company says about coinjoin.
7)	Here is a presentation on how Taproot can allow for UTXOs with untraceable swaps and indistinguishable payment channels. Taproot allows privacy txs to share the same anonymity set as regular onchain transactions thus eliminates the concerns with everyone forced to opt into a privacy Bitcoin wallet to have a larger anonymity set.
 
8)	Privacy is a complex topic that has many nuances. Many privacy coins have lower tx fees(Bitcoin has lower tx fees on other layers) than Bitcoin onchain(mainly because they are hardly used and have low value) . Lower onchain tx fees can lead to the risk of very inexpensive attacks to deanonymize users as well. Bitcoin being designed where onchain fees will grow to cover the cost on security (and as explained privacy)  and inexpensive txs occur on other layers(that are very private like lightning which is multihop and onion routed by default which makes coin analytics practically impossible) is the better balanced solution IMHO.

Agreed, Bitcoin needs much more liquidity to be a stable unit of account . Thus the early investors(per fiat invested) will be mostly in these two categories ~2100 Billionaires in the world and at least ~36 million millionaires. These two categories will slowly start hedging 1-5% of their portfolios with uncorrelated asset classes like Bitcoin and because only 7-8 million BTC will be on the table for possibly being sold in the next 10 years they will be fighting over it while driving up the price of Bitcoin. 
Others who understand this will become wealthy along with these early adopters as well.
@_date: 2016-12-12 12:35:14


Within Ethereum most of the devs supported the hardfork , within Bitcoin the opposite is true. 


I disagree, The amount of development has exploded, but individuals obsessed with the blocksize are blind to all the work being done. 


Excellent, The way bitcoin was designed. 


Segwit gives us 2-4MB blocks but with a safer , backward compatible upgrade. Are you advocating 4-8MB blocks?


Agreed , and they will tend to follow the developers and oracles advice. Bitcoin won't "work" as expected if inflation doubles due to a chain split either, and any HF for merely a kick the can will definitely leave 2 surviving coins with a permanent scar on bitcoins immutability.

value is allocated into acquiring Bitcoin , whether it be energy , money , or other goods and services
The context here is countries reserving Bitcoin as a % in their reserve currency allocation though so market cap and volatility do not matter much since Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class that has a promising future.

When it comes to regulating finance in general the policies and laws are such that they are intentionally ambiguous to insure they can use discretion in enforcing the rules. This will never change regardless who is president as doing so will allow clever accountants and lawyers to manipulate loopholes in a far easier manner which the state will never tolerate.
For regulators and politicians , All I want them doing is ignoring Bitcoin and sneering at it as being pointless and pathetic. I don't want them understanding it and would rather them have the hubris to avoid any concerns to the true threat Bitcoin poses for their ability to regulate finances and commerce in the corrupt way they prefer. Fiat is unlikely to disappear anytime soon , but states will eventually be forced to start being more responsible with it.

Ethereum is a premined scam.
1) Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense to the credulous. 
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.
Additionally, there are plenty of ICO's who have locked up Ethereum's and need to constantly sell them for fiat to pay for their burn rate going into next year which places a constant negative pressure on ETH price

Running software that fully validates all the rules like \- [
Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is over \~170GB for an archival node
Pruned nodes can get down to around 5GB , and have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it \(It actually prunes as it validates\)
You are only truly p2p if you are running a full node . running light clients depend upon you trusting a middleman and typically only validate block headers. Light clients are exposed to many more threats full nodes are not. There are also privacy concerns with light clients that full nodes are secure against. The whitepaper only suggests SPV "light" nodes in the context of fraud alerts\(proofs\) existing but thus far none exist and therefore you shouldn't trust large amounts of btc with a light client.
The most secure , "active" wallet would be a hardware wallet integrated with a full node . Unfortunately, the only way to indirectly do this easily is to run your own electrum server and than integrate electrum wallet with your HW wallet and connect to your electrum server. The HW wallet devs are working on integrating with core now.
There are over 87k full nodes on the bitcoin network .\(Some sites show much lower numbers because they exclude most non listening full nodes. \)

This might help you define the power dynamics in Bitcoin -
Here is a breakdown of the power dynamics in bitcoin when it comes to the rules of the protocol.
**Miners** have invested a lot in infrastructure , but have tight margins and typically have electrical and rental contracts where they cannot afford to mine coins that are unprofitable for long due to the community rejecting it. 
**exchanges** Have a lot of influence upon the naming of tokens or at least their ticker and act as somewhat of a large investor. This is another reason among many that we advise you to store your BTC yourself because we want users to be in control and not large centralized exchanges. They can also help predict an outcome of a split with future trading pairs. 
**Merchants and payment processors** give legitimacy to a chain , increase its network effect and influence more users to use that chain in the long term
**Developers, specialists and Oracles**  They cannot force code upon the users and since nodes don't self update economic users can reject their proposals with as little as inaction. These people indirectly influence economic users indirectly because the whole ecosystem depends upon them for security fixes and updates. Many developers are extremely large stakeholders due to being involved in Bitcoin since 2010 and 2011. 
**economic Users** have the most control. Ones that validate the rules with a full node cannot be coerced into new rules even with 100% of hashpower deciding upon something. Since miners have such high overhead they will typically quickly follow the lead of these users because they buy their product and it is quite costly to ignore their wishes. 
Not all economic users are equal however and there are different types of economic users. 
1) **Spenders** tend to use bitcoin for its utility and buy it just to spend instead of long term investment. These cannot influence HF split outcomes much because they typically do not have many BTC at any given time thus aren't awarded many BTC split tokens to wield their influence with
2) **Hodlers / Investors** These individuals have a great power and there are approximately ~30 to 70 large whales in our ecosystem who have between 10,000 and 100k BTC . Since they are given both sides of the coin in HF they can quickly determine the outcome in a speculation war . These people tend to be conservative IMHO with scaling as they have greatly profited from the years of stability and have a lot to risk by any proposal that damages bitcoins key characteristics or security. With every passing year the amount of large whales will drop and BTC will become more evenly distributed.
In reality we want bitcoiners to be both spenders and investors and there is a spectrum in the two above with how much one fits in each category

The Market will start to price in the value of gold by nation states and investors reducing their exposure to gold before mining occurs. If the USA has a head start on mining psyche than other nation states will want to hedge with another asset than gold. 


Gold bars are registered and certified as well unless you melt it down which few people do. Bitcoin with lightning and coinjoin is very fungible. People do not have a problem spending or using Bitcoin after getting them from ransomeware or DNMs either. 


You cannot restore your gold with 12 /24 words if you lose it like Bitcoin. You cannot create a multisig of gold either.


You have to be more specific than this for me to address your concerns. 


Because that was one of the main reasons many invested in gold, as a hedge against crisis, not because it has ever been a good investment. If you are buying gold because you think its a great investment you might want to try to understand compound interest and re-evaluate it compared to other investments . 


Bitcoin is much easier to secure than gold as well

Ethereum has proven itself not to provide immutability and the proposed solution is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. 
What code do you have problems running on your computer or server? Do you currently have issues with people censoring your code? Can you imagine one day in the future where this would be a concern and if so what theoretical means could someone censor your code? Do you know how inefficient ethereum is for executing code?
People who are not programmers have some fundamental misunderstandings as to how things actually work in this space and basic computer science problems. Are you aware that censoring code execution is an impossibly impractical task?

Here is a writeup on various attack threats with Bitcoin and how they are mitigated -
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:52:45
99% of Cryptocurrency investment schemes or projects are scams. 
**Common types of Scams to avoid**
**Advanced Fee Fraud-**  This is one of the most common forms of fraud, and is popular even outside the cryptocurrency ecosystem. With cryptocurrency it often takes to form of these variations:
**a)** The con artist will claim they have a large amount of Bitcoin "stuck" in an exchange because of legal reasons or some other excuse and need your assistance to withdraw the Bitcoin. They offer you their username and password to log into their account and claim that you can even keep a large reward and than send them the difference of Bitcoins to their personal wallet. When you login to withdraw the Bitcoin you will notice a high withdraw fee or deposit that needs to be made for verification  before you are allowed to withdraw the Bitcoin that cannot be subtracted from the balance. Since the fee is much less than your expected reward and the exchange looks legitimate despite being one you are unfamiliar with you pay the fee and than realize that the exchange is a fake one that will never allow you to withdraw the Bitcoin. 
**b)** You are trying to sell something online and someone offers you a pre-payment in fiat with a payment service, a cashiers check,  or a regular check and than "accidentally" overpays and asks for a refund to be sent to them in Bitcoin or by other methods. You are confident you receive the money because you deposit the check and it appears to clear and shows up in your bank account or digitally shows in your paypal account or other platform and so you are happy to send them the difference in over payment. One key aspect is international money transfers, gift card payments, or Bitcoin are typically non-reversible while most other payments are reversible and this can occur at almost anytime in the future. The check or payment can be involved in fraud or be fake and the payment platform or bank will reverse the deposit(possibly leaving you with a negative balance) and you will be legally liable to reimburse the bank. You will than be left with having to reimburse the bank and be out of Bitcoin and the product you sold the scammer. 
**c)** A company offers you an investment or mining opportunity and to gain your trust is even willing to send you some Bitcoin up front to gain your confidence. Problem is the Bitcoin is frozen in their platform , a watch only wallet, represented in a fake blockchain explorer, or you did not wait for a confirmation to insure that you can use it and you invest in them not knowing that the Bitcoin they sent you is unusable. 
**d)** A contest or free giveaway usually promoted by a celebrity(typically a fake account on twitter) offers you free Bitcoin or cryptocurrency if you make a small bitcoin deposit up front to enter. The grifter will take your BTC and run.
**Investment Opportunity-** These take the form of a company that allows you to make an investment and has promised guaranteed returns due to them trading cryptocurrency, mining cryptocurrency, or any other investment enterprise such as real estate. Some will simply take your Bitcoin and run and others are ponzi schemes which will slowly payout rewards to their platform that you can never withdraw or make payouts but these never add up to your total investment.
**Altcoins, ICOs, Security tokens** 99% of these are pointless projects or scams which make dishonest marketing claims that most people don't have the technical ability to evaluate. Even projects that have the best of intentions fail because the incentives are all misaligned for an exit when you give 100% funding upfront without regulation, contract with preconditions, and invested from unqualified credulous investors. Sticking to projects that are 100% proof of work with no premine or instamine from the start is a way to filter through most of these projects but in the end you should do your due diligence and learn about the project before investing. This applies to Bitcoin as well. People should be free to invest in whatever project they wish but one should do so with an understanding in what they are investing in. 
**Cloud Mining Contracts** Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees which mean you will never ROI. Cloud mining typically falls into 3 categories
**a)**	legit mining company that actually mines what you invest, but is misleading to clients the harsh reality of hashing difficulty increasing and fees = You will not profit and not make a ROI
**b)**	Cloudmining company that fractionally reserve mines to keep up appearances and prove they actually are doing some mining but in reality do not mine the hashrate that they are contractually obligated to = You will not profit and not make a ROI
**c)** Straight up ponzi scheme with no mining = You will not profit and not make a ROI
Mining is very competitive and if miners need to both pay for marketing, profit sharing , affiliate revenue, and management of many small clients or partners this overhead will quickly drive them out of business.
Keep in mind that BTC mining difficulty is typically increasing , which means the payouts are fine initially but than naturally get smaller and smaller as the months go on. So at first everything seems fine than you notice later you start to get less and less until there is no payout.
So people that cloud mine either come away from the experience bitter and don't return , or they make a profit , but not from mining but from the appreciation of Bitcoin during their contract. I.E... They invest 500 USD , cloud mining company pays back 300 USd of BTC over the next year , but because Bitcoin appreciated in value that BTC is now worth 800 dollars and the client is happy because they don't have the know how to compare what that investment would be worth if they simply sat on it and waited for their bitcoin to appreciate in value.

Data in Bitcoin is stored in a "Block Chain" with chains of blocks that includes data like signatures. You are suggesting that blocks won't be larger because signatures are "no longer count towards that total." which is factually incorrect and absurd because whether or not signatures are counted they are still needed and fill the blocks in full nodes. Blocks in segwit will indeed be larger averaging 1.8MB instead of 1MB and can be as large as ~3.6MB, as mined on testnet.
In your imagination where is signature data stored? A separate chain of blocks?

Look at the numbers above, half of all millennial's are currently in the "early career" demographic where they have ~30% of their income to invest in part in Bitcoin. There are many wealthy Millennial's that started investing in Bitcoin from 2011 to 2014 already. I am not from the USA , but from my research their economy is extremely healthy right now with low unemployment and higher wages across the board. The US economy is so healthy my country had to blow through all our USD savings(hundreds of millions) used as a hedge last year to keep our USD/CRC trading pair from slipping further.

Correct, and people like me will notice this behavior and will take action to attack such pool that chooses to follow through with this controversial practice. I want segwit to be activated as well, but it is better we have this activated with a high degree of support so we can win a large "PR battle" as well. This is the same reason why lowering the activation threshold is out of the question as well. Segwit will activate when it is time and companies like viabtc are merely shells for bitmain testing the water and seeing how the community reacts. Once segwit gets over 50% the resistance will quickly start to fade.

Interesting point, but unfortunately I don't believe there will be  a major shift in power dynamics because many wealthy family home offices are already investing in a little Bitcoin and they can buy more Bitcoins than many other folks. So the shift is mainly going to be with a small group of Nouveau riche that got into Bitcoin anytime from 2009 to 2013, and than perhaps a shift from the wealthy that are more statist in their political leanings to the wealthy that are more capitalistic or libertarian in their politics as a higher %(but not all ) of the 2100 billionaires and 36 million millionaires worldwide that invest in Bitcoin earlier tend to be more "free market" and libertarian with their politics. There will be a larger shift that has already begun long before Bitcoin as well where programmers , engineers and men (unfortunately very few women are interested in cryptocurrency and divorce courts will have a hard time finding and seizing BTC) have greater amounts of wealth IMHO
The earlier estimated from mtgox data reflected around 70 BTC whales that had between 10-100k BTC, my estimates as this number has been cut in half with many taking profits since 2014 and spending BTC or just losing it gambling and starting up businesses. Of these Nouveau riche I suspect this number to further drop to perhaps 10-15 in the next 10 years as taking profits and diversifying ones portfolio will be to tempting for many of these early adopters, thus an early whale will reduce his stake for 20k BTC to 5-10 k BTc and bee selling primarily to the 36 million millionaires and billionaires that exist

What will likely happen is either a slow adoption to segwit, or a few core devs release an updated HF code in a couple months (that the community will naturally refuse because the activation threshold will be high) but just the release of it will encourage them to jump on board with segwit.
Either way , there is no hurry to activate segwit, we can improve bitcoin in many other areas as we wait , even if it is 6 months, 1 year , or longer. BIP 9 allows for concurrent softforks.

I haven't published it yet but there are many articles that discuss this topic in general. The key concept to understand is you need to calculate the total environmental impact of all the human energy used to secure fiat which is much more when you add up all the auditors, bank managers, bank employees, regulators, central bankers, accountants, lawyers, etc.. Of course this is a very complex calculation that is difficult to do(because some of these roles involve multiple objectives) but humans are some of the least efficient means of coming to consensus. Bitcoin does indeed involve human security as well but nowhere to such a degree as fiat in general. 
There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

All of those projects are very naive as well. Can you clearly explain to me how a blockchain solves the security concerns in voting specifically, even hypothetically? If you are aware of the security concerns , having people vote on a cellphone would be a security nightmare. Blockchains are not some magical panacea that you can throw at any problem. IF you don't believe me than start asking some basic questions as to why voting booths are private and why receipts with who you voted for are not given to voters but collected by the staff at a local precinct to be counted manually by people of different political parties if the vote was close or fraud is suspected.

I don't care about the short term price fluctuations. 2020 will likely be an amazing year for Bitcoin but I'm not selling any and just buying more. My horizons are at least 8 years out before considering taking profits. 
There is a generational change occurring with not only investing but preference in banking and currency usage. 
millennial's and Generation Z grew up in the digital world and have little interest in investing in gold or silver and don't trust banks. People investing in gold and silver(or gold mining companies) I meet are typically in their late 40s or older. What is interesting about this shift is the key aspect of gold that these older gold bugs appreciate about their investment , being tangible and physical commodity that can be used and held physically , is the same thing that these 2 last generations reject and see as a burden or something that takes up space or inconvenient to store or secure.
Generation Y or Millennial's (born ~1982 to 2002) are now 37 to 17 and will begin to replace generation X as the new group with thee greatest investing and spending capital (ages 45-54). This means in as little as 8 years you are going to start to see the transition of millennial into peak spending/investing ages and start to push out gen X who is more ambivalent/mixed to digital era. Baby boomers will be well into retirement and not be investing/spending and more living off their IRAs and pensions and their lack of familiarity and confidence of cryptocurrency will have little consequence. Thus in 8 years you will have gen Y enter their peak spending and investing and gen Z fill the next greatest category of spenders/investors(early career).
The other key takeaway is that these age groups also shift from not only spending more but investing more which is critical. Lets look at the breakdown averages in the USA-
1) Less than 25 Years Old – $31,102 in spending (94.6%% of total income)
2) Between 25-34 Years – $48,928 in spending (**70.8%** of total income)
3) Between 45-54 Years – $64,781 in spending (**64.6%** of total income)
4) Over 75 Years Old – $40,211 in spending (95.6% of total income)
Notice from 25 to 54 these individuals have the most money not only to spend but also to invest. Baby boomers retiring are spending almost all their income surviving (healthcare) and/or vacationing and no longer investing. Once gen Y and gen Z dominate these 2 age brackets than a heavy bias towards Bitcoin will occur.

Running software that fully validates all the rules like - [
Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes  to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is  over \~170GB for an  archival node
Pruned nodes can get down to around \~5GB , and have all the same  security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially  download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it (It  actually prunes as it validates)
You are only truly p2p if you are running a full node . running light  clients depend upon you trusting a middleman and typically only  validate block headers. Light clients are exposed to many more threats  full nodes are not. There are also privacy concerns with light clients  that full nodes are secure against. The whitepaper only suggests SPV  "light" nodes in the context of fraud alerts(proofs) existing but thus  far none exist and therefore you shouldn't trust large amounts of btc  with a light client.
The most secure , "active" wallet would be a hardware wallet  integrated with a full node . Unfortunately, the only way to indirectly  do this easily is to run your own electrum server and than integrate  electrum wallet with your HW wallet and connect to your electrum server.  The HW wallet devs are working on integrating with core now.
There are close to 88k  full nodes on the bitcoin network .(Some  sites show much lower numbers because they exclude most non listening  full nodes. )

Do not daytrade
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 
Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well

This is mostly true . Economic nodes are what matter the most which is one reason among many we tell people to withdraw their BTC from exchanges. Non economic full nodes have some utility in bootstraping new nodes however.


This statement seems to contradict your follow up comment though. Large whales hodling 10-100k BTC in their full node absolutely have a large amount of influence on the network and their decision to reject certain blocks in a fork war is something many people did care about in 2017 and will care about in future disagreements.

This might be true, but I suppose one could argue the SP500 has a longer history of expected returns .  That sub tends to hate Bitcoin is the true reason you are flagged though.

This is an important concept that you understand and many people don't. Fiat is a form of registered value, and Bitcoin is a Bearer asset like gold. They have fundamentally different properties and security assumptions. Bitcoin can be made to act somewhat like registered value if you setup a Bitcoin Bank and use them to arbitrate your txs and perform "chargebacks" on your behalf but than loses some of the benefits and features of Bitcoin as designed. It is more than likely that Bitcoin and fiat will play different roles where fiat is used by credit card companies and businesses that need to conform to tax laws, and Bitcoin acts more as a 2nd global currency(more akin to physical cash tax wise) that many people use and save , including the states as a hedge against their currency instead of gold or other fiat. There are many countries today that retailers transact in 2 currencies as the norm like in central and south america .

That is the average , and why Bitcoin txs onchain are very inexpensive. This also doesn't account for batching either. 1 BTC onchain tx can have many outputs


More tx batching and more segwit usage will occur if the fee market grows .

This is already possible(and what is being done as the paper ballots are only hand counted under certain conditions) with electronic machines that have paper receipts as a backup. Keep in mind that this does not address the security concerns with voting on a cell phone. How do you know the person voting on a cell is the right person and not a compromised account
? How do you know the person voting on their cell phone is not being coerced? 


No the exact opposite would occur. A private voting booth without giving the voter any voting confirmation(Giving the voter the receipt of who they voted for can allow for coercion as well that is why paper receipts are kept at the voting precincts) is specifically designed to avoid coercion. With voting at home on a cell phone :
a) husband can force their wife and other legal family members in household to vote for their preferred candidate
b) Employer can force all their employees to sit in their conference room and vote a certain way 
c) outside hackers could teamviewer or remote connect to persons phone and force them to vote a certain way or vote for the person. 


No, without a physical printed receipt to verify and do recounts going 100% digital encourages more manipulation via coercion or a bug/exploit in the software

this malware typically changes the address in the clipboard , not on the QRcode or address within a web browser, thus a HW wallet does indeed prevent these attacks for the most part because you verify the address on the hardware wallet itself before clicking send. Before clicking send you compare the address in your HW wallet outside the infected machine with the address on the website that has not been modified.

This is not a hypothetical. China has already banned (in some form) Bitcoin and unbanned it many times over the years and we have seen exactly the effects. Large countries like India and China already have a banking ban on BTC... china might soon lift this ban. Yes, I know you are suggesting a total ban , but a ban in commerce really doesn't cause a liquidity crunch in bitcoin as bitcoin is mostly used for savings and capital flight now and people will still buy it even if they cannot spend it in stores. 


Volatility is a huge problem for bitcoins use as a currency , for the consumer and merchant and everyone. Volatility has been going down over the years, and in the interim Bitcoin is a useful currency for arbitraging censorship and capital controls


As previously discussed, I can spend my Bitcoin even without merchants knowing I am spending it. 
Very useful for people in countries that have hyperinflation or for people avoiding asset and civil forfeiture or just traveling. 
There is no doubt that bans create friction and thus liquidity crunches in Bitcoin. I don't think its realistic that the whole world becomes totalitarian and bans the use of Bitcoin however and if they do we have much bigger problems at hand and there will be a lot of violence.

cash app can be cheaper because you can instant buy on a dip even if you lack the fiat . Thus if Bitcoin dips 5% (common ) you can pay 1.1% more but not have to wait a week where if BTc recovers or goes higher you will pay ~4% of more with coinbase pro 
Thus -
1) If you are buying large amounts and have the fiat up front than wire the funds to kraken and use a buy limit order = 5 usd deposit + wire fee + 0.16% + 5 usd withdraw fee 
Thus if your bank charges 15 usd for a wire than any purchase above ~6k use kraken 
2) If you already have money preloaded in coinbase pro , use coinbase pro 
3) If you don't have money preeloaded in coinbase pro than use cash app on dips

Thank you. 11  is another item that takes 0 effort -
11) Set various buy limit orders (In addition to buying Bitcoin at regular intervals)  on an exchange you use with deposited fiat. This will decrease Bitcoin's volatility by increasing buy limit support which is critical to both investor confidence and Bitcoin maturing into a stable currency and a less volatile unit of account. The side benefit is you can auto pickup any dips and save money.
12) Help answer new user questions on r/BitcoinBeginners

Slow and steady wins the race. I will keep converting my fiat to btc , and have plenty of limit buy orders in for the last few frustrated rage quits when they can't get their way. My "pain point" is the introduction of better BIP's that offer better solutions. If other implementations out compete core developers with better code than I'll happily run their software. I care about the longterm health of bitcoin, therefore do not need "to get rich quick" by going mainstream on an insecure platform tomorrow.

Why do you need to use solidity which is one of the worst choices one could choose.


You do not need a blockchain to do this. How do you think servers did this before ethereum? Ethereum is an act of supererogation . You do not need to execute the same code across thousands of nodes to have certainty that it has been run. I would suggest you start from the basics and learn about cryptography and how PGP works in particular and how this relates to servers or nodes being able to validate code running or information and timestamping.

The cost to secure fiat is much higher than Bitcoin due to the amount of human time and energy spent in security. Have you done a comprehensive analysis on the energy used to secure fiat?
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:26:04
It is far more complicated than you explain. 
Amazon paying less taxes allows us to buy lower cost items and them to continue to pay out to their affiliates at a higher rate and hire more people. Governments regularly give tax breaks to corporations to incentive them to hire more people of build more offices/warehouses in certain jurisdictions. It is also comparing apples to oranges to compare human individual tax rates to nonhuman corporation taxes.
Even if you wanted to target corporations and have them pay more taxes , VAT does not effectively do this.

I encourage them to save 3-6 months in living expenses of a stable fiat even before buying Bitcoin. (If they just want to spend and replace to use BTC that is a different story and they can do this right away). Not having stable forms of fiat like USD or euros is a very dangerous situation to be in. Investors should be properly hedged. If you are suggesting people give up all fiat and use cryptocurrencies entirely than this is dangerous and reckless and reflects a deep misunderstanding of the differences between registered value and bearer assets and how important liquidity is.

Latency is a concern, unless this external hard drive is usb C  and an ssd , it might be wiser to run the full node on your osx hard drive and just prune it so its to ~5GB , but than if you are trying to run a LN node that will be a problem 


1) Setup electrum personal server(this is your full node) on that linux box 
 
2) Use electrum with your nano s and configure electrum to use your personal server you setup above (Full node plus HW wallet) -
ledger nano S crash course:
3) Record your 24 words on paper + record your passphrase on a separate paper you keep private and secure and separate from your hardware wallet and each other. You will both memorize your passphrase and pin + keep it in writing but not with your 24 word backup. Never store passphrase or mnemonic backup digitally. 
Consider upgrading to metal backup - 
4) Withdraw a small test amount of BTC from coinbase pro(not coinbase) to your receive address on your electrum + ledger wallet. You can tx those btc from coinbase to coinbase pro for free with deposit button in coinbase pro than withdraw from coinbase pro to avoid any overcharged withdraw fee. You are going to send BTC to your hidden wallet with the passphrase.
5) Confirm you got the BTC, reset your ledger nano S, recover it with 24 words + passphrase . Now you have trained yourself how to recover a wallet with backup and 100% confident you did everything right once you see the BTc again in your hidden wallet. 
6)	Send a small amount of BTC to your non hidden wallet(protected by pin) , and the rest to your hidden wallet(protected by passphrase). Done and send more BTC to hidden wallet account addresses.

Which is precisely why I suggest that mining decentralization will solidify and stagnate development on the base protocol.

This is a comparison between physical cash and Bitcoin as most fiat txs are digital in nature. Bitcoin technically can be transferred in the same way as physical cash with opendimes or coins but this is less common. 


Onchain txs are instant, its the confirmations that take time , but thats why 2nd layer solutions like lightning were created for instant confirmations. when you receive a cc , debit or check you don't get an instant confirmation either BTW... chargebacks can occur at anytime in the future and very common. 


Bitcoin requires the sender to spend a few pennies (or much less with lightning ) and 0 fee for the receiver or merchant unlike credit cards that have 3% + 30 cents and higher typically or in many countries 7 to 9% not including all the loss from chargebacks. It is important to tell the whole story here. 


Privacy is much more nuanced than this. Bitcoin txs on lightning for example are extremely private. Digital Fiat is not private at all , and physical fiat cash is far less private than you suggest, due to fiat sniffing dogs, OCR that reads serials on bills and links bills to your ID at most ATMs and all Banks, and the fact that you need to deal with a merchant typically in person with cash thus have witnesses and security camera footage of your tx. There are unique tradeoffs and distinctions with privacy when comparing fiat and BTC.


You will need to define your terms here and be more specific as this is too broad.

If you mean that we should change maxBlockSize = 2MB in addition to segwit this would require a dangerous HF and would mean Blocksizes could be as big 8MB which would be too large- 
Here is more analysis focusing on 8MB and only full nodes in the capital city with highest speed connections.-
8 MB requires 2.987Mbps up minimum for 8 peers unrestricted. 
I see many countries in this list with average upload speeds lower than this , and even if you look at peak speeds in capital cities you have to consider that home users cannot use all of their bandwidth for their home node as they have multiple users and devices sharing the uplink.
Lets take one of many examples and drive down on the evidence to only focus on the speeds in a capital city-
 1.3MB upload ... so even if one would to use 100% of the bandwidth it couldn't handle the above.
Here is another capital city -
 588kbps up
Almost the whole continent of Africa would be forced to use a VPS as well. Wow!
Also I don't agree we should force all nodes offline outside of capital cities either, but even if we consider the whole country you would be forcing users to rent VPS's in many countries or severely limit their full node.

The more tether is a scam (not 100% backed by BTC or leveraged) the less it effects Bitcoin. Also keep in mind the primary purpose of tether, providing liquidity to sketchy exchanges so that users can daytrade in altcoins. Tethers possible downfall will hurt Bitcoin, but altcoins more buy drying up liquidity as many alts need tether to be purchased unlike with Bitcoin. 
TL;DR = Tether should be avoided but Bitcoin will be fine and survive this as we have with Mt Gox.

This is where we disagree and why our viewpoints differ so much.

Thin clients nowadays, simply require you to trust another and than makes bitcoin not "peer to peer".

They both help , compact blocks + FIBRE is far more important, but in a race to find a block, every single ms helps and therefore miners renting out space within Bitmian's insanely large farm will have an advantage. Because mining is so competitive and profit margins so narrow we see mining companies looking for all sorts of ways to increase their profits from BTCC selling complete 25 and 12.5 Ti engraved virgin blocks and coins to Bitmain getting in the business of renting out warehouse space for mining.  
This is akin to the problem with wall street High frequency traders where they purposely locate all their datacenters close by and run the most expensive OC10 lines and still have to have regulations where everyone needs to have the same length fiberoptic cable as other competitors because even a slight amount of latency can give your competitor and advantage. The larger blocks gets the bigger this will be a problem.

Not interested in PoS as its insecure, not new or novel, and antithetical to why blockchains where created in the first place. Many people fail to realize why "blocks" even technically need to exist.


5% is rather high, so i would suggest you avoid this exchange. Cash app allows you to use your card and has no fee but the spread means that you will typically pay ~1.49% above coinbase pro. These smaller exchanges also typically have a larger spread as well so the "fee" might even be higher than 5%

It doesn't matter if you are pro and against Bitcoin. What matters is if you are aware of the security benefits and weaknesses of Bitcoin as many of your concerns do not apply or are similar with gold. Gold has some properties that are superior to Bitcoin and vice versa, but you only slightly broached on them.
Gold has better UX when trading physical gold coins and can easily be validated with a special tool in person. Gold has some industrial use cases as well. Gold has a much longer history as a store of value. Gold has more liquidity than Bitcoin for now. Gold is less volatile than Bitcoin for now.

when I read much of the "tech analysis" suggesting that Bitcoin is not very advanced or altcoins are 2nd generation or more advanced it mainly comes from regurgitated propaganda and marketing instead of any real understanding of the technology. Most altcoins are pump and dump memes or solutions looking for a problem. We don't want Bitcoin to simply adopt features because it helps market it to luddites. The design and engineering decisions need to actually address problems and security considerations that exist.

It is fair to consider Bitcoin a risky investment, but many people in  r/personalfinance are not properly hedged(many are 100% stocks, 0 gold, 0 Bitcoin, 0 bonds) they are actually promoting risky behavior by not hedging in a diverse portfolio with uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin.

**Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro vs Cash App** 
All these companies are insured and very easy to setup and verify with great UX. Due to its simplicity Cash App is a little easier to use out of the 3. All these methods require AML/KYC verification, cash app delays this until you withdraw the BTC.
**Pros**-- Easier to Use than coinbase pro. Allows you to lock in a price (but have to wait ~1 week) for BTC to be released which is helpful during a bull market.  
Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading=  ~1 week delay on withdrawing Bitcoin, more complex to use than cash app, highest fees with 1.49 % bank transfer and 3.99% debit card fees, overcharges on withdrawal fees or onchain transactions 
**Pros**-- Lowest fees of the 3 when you use a buy limit order = 0.5%, unlike coinbase pays for your onchain withdrawal fee(But the week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on fiat arriving preventing buying can make you lose BTC unlike the other 2)
Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading=  ~1 week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on depositing fiat with bank transfers before you can buy BTC, most complex to use of all 3
**Square Cash App**
**Pros**-- Easiest to use of the 3, Best alignment with Bitcoin politically, Allows you to lock in the price immediately and withdraw quickly(once verified), No fees to buy Bitcoin or withdraw bitcoin
**Cons**-- Only available in USA, despite having no fees their spread is slightly wider thus making them slightly more expensive that coinbase pro typically
Cash App charges no fee but has a larger spread of ~1.6% compared to coinbase pro on average. Thus you will pay 1.45% more than coinbase pro. The retail side of Coinbase allows you to buy with 1.49% with an ACH but will typically make you wait a 7-10 days to withdraw your BTC. This rate might seem cheaper than cash app but their spread is different in the retail side(coinbase.com) thus it comes out to around the same rate or slightly worse than cash app. Cash app allows you to withdraw BTC much quicker than coinbase as well.
Thus , if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar , but also likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount in a bull market.
Good idea to setup an account with either "Cash app and coinbase pro" or "gemini and cash app" if you are in the USA. Unless you live outside the USA , you should never use regular coinbase due to the fees. 
Use cash app during a bull market where you need to instantly lock in the price. Perhaps use coinbase pro in a Bear market where the delay won't hurt you or if you need to sell some Bitcoin.
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange. You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys. After buying your bitcoin withdraw them to your personal wallet**

Bitcoin bear markets can last 1 to 1.5 years and if an emergency comes up you are not forced to sell your btc for a loss if you lose your job or an emergency occurs. It also makes you a more rational investor since you become immune to volatility. 6-12 months of fiat living expenses is preferred , but a goal of at least 3 months should be a target
Fiat savings also allows you to take greater risks like ask for a raise , or leave jobs for a higher paying one if the opportunity presents  itself

Thanks for the article. Here is my opinion on some of the opinions expressed therein -
**BREADWALLET** 
This is an OK wallet, but has a couple problems. Lacks RBF for fee bumping , doesn't implement segwit by default, and has a much larger attack surface. It also preloads bcash which is a UX nightmare for new users. 
IMHO if you like the UX of BRD , better use hodlwallet which solves most the concerns above - 
or better yet use blockstream green if you need a wallet for ios
**edge** Has many of the same issues as Brd so should be avoided
**SAMOURAI** - This is an ok privacy wallet. Main concerns are-
1) Their developers have been too defensive with fair peer review which is a concern 
2) No fiat balance so harder to use for newbies 
3) Coinjoin feature is great but you essentially need to trust your privacy with them unlike joinmarket or wasabi
IMHO wasabi is a much better privacy wallet , but Samourai is easier to use and is available on android

Many people here have studied the explanations for why slight inflation is desirable, one of them being to encouraging lending and investment in other asset classing rather than saving. 
We also know that a volatile currency is a poor unit of account and Bitcoin needs to mature much more in usability and stability before it can fit this particular role effectively mainstream. 
There are valid arguments that can also be made that slight deflation or 0 % inflation is the ideal target to reduce misallocation of capital and for a more efficient economy . 
From that paper - 


This well researched paper reflects that 0% is the ideal target. Also understand that lending can still occur with 0% inflation or slight deflation(You just need to account for this in the loan interest rate ), as its the volatility and unpredictability which is the true enemy of lending. Also keep in mind that investments will still occur under these scenarios as well as people will always have an interest in a higher rate of return or control and oversight in a direction of a company. A slight deflationary currency  would mainly be competing with some low yield investment options and not stocks, VC  or angel investments regardless. 
Now you may disagree with the above but it is reasonable to suggest that high deflation and high inflation are clearly **not desirable targets for a currency** and more research is needed on the topic as to the nuances and differences between low deflation, 0% inflation , and low inflation. It is possible there is not a clear winner and tradeoffs with each as well. 
This is what Bitcoin provides, an open and transparent project that is testing some economic assumptions that we can all learn from.

One of the principle raison d'être of Bitcoin is regulatory arbitrage therefore it is quite absurd that states would try and undermine their own regulations. 


I could indeed see a future where states begrudgingly accept the fact that Bitcoin exists and allow local banks to regulate bitcoin's onramps and offramps. I can also see a future where governments pivot almost 180 and directly attack bitcoin in a hostile matter (time is running out quickly for any chance of success with this however)

There are 2 main problems from running a pruned node:
1) New users cannot bootstrap off you , therefore there needs to be a certain percentage of nodes that remain archival 
2) If you corrupt your node you may need to resync , which includes redownloading the whole chain and revalidating it, which takes longer with a pruned node. This is rare but annoying if it occurs. 
Other than this a pruned node is just as secure as an archival full node.

Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading 
Day traders find that they become obsessed with checking the price and end up spending most of their productive time looking at charts instead of working for a salary.
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:29:04


All that effort is foolish because block chains are extremely inefficient by design to pay for security.

This has been the case since 2011 and later. As soon is bitcoin started to grow in users differences of opinions started to occur, which is healthy and expected. Part of the wonderful thing about bitcoin is individuals define the consensus rules and no one , not miners or other devs can impose these rules upon economic users.


Perhaps if this was their first bubble. Those of us that have gone through many speculation bubbles expect to go through many more and do care about the longterm success of bitcoin


This has always been the case and simply means that we are still in the early adoption phase. Remember , since Bitcoin follows the Austrian school of monetary economics , most people will actively oppose it naturally as they hate competing currencies that undermine fiat.


Those people are in for a rude awakening as shorting bitcoin is extremely dangerous. Best to avoid day trading in general.

Fees go to miners to secure the network, where anyone can participate as a miner in an open system. 
Miners order transaction priority.
Economic full nodes validate block/tx and the consensus rules.
This might help you define the power dynamics in Bitcoin=

This is misleading as there is also state sales tax ontop of the proposed federal VAT. Thus it is more akin to a 14 to 23% tax on everything not including all the other taxes which will be a burden that effects the middle class and poor the most. 


1k a month in more spending money simply means the cost of goods and services will increase. What matters is not how many units of fiat one has ultimately, but how much spending power their income is. Just look at Argentina and Venezuela as examples. You don't get prosperity by taking away peoples money and giving it back to them either. What you want is low unemployement (something UBI does not help) and productivity increasing.


VAT is not some novel or new concept but has existed in Europe for many years. You cannot just assume Yang has some secret answer to the way the wealthy avoid these taxes. If he does , he should answer it on his website. 
Also VAT gives the government a dangerous level of information which is tyrannical in nature and leads to corruption and lack of privacy unlike sales tax.

My opinion is merely they should take effective and practical solutions at solving their problem as a banking ban on Bitcoin does not stop the wealthy from buying Bitcoin and does not stop capital flight.

I live and travel in many countries in Latin america and stable coins are impractical and pointless for the most part. These are just tools for degenerate day traders using sketchy exchanges that cannot touch fiat because they don't meet the regulatory burden or fads for other exchanges to profit off of using a token for capture(similar to gift cards or points to keep people spending with a certain service)
 Bitcoin can be used as a store of value and capital flight, but what we need and use is stable forms of fiat for day to day currencies. Most latin  american countries are dual fiat currency countries as well where stores will accept USD just fine and Us locals have wallets filled with local fiat and USD the same.

Yes its rather true, many millennial's and Generation Z grew up in the digital world and have little interest in investing in gold or silver. People investing in gold and silver(or gold mining companies) I meet are typically in their late 40s or older. What is interesting about this shift is the key aspect of gold that these older gold bugs appreciate about their investment , being tangible and physical commodity that can be used and held physically , is the same thing  that these 2 last generations reject and see as a burden or something that takes up space or inconvenient to store or secure.
Generation Y or Millennial's (born ~1982 to 2002) are now 37 to 17 and will begin to replace generation X as the new group with thee greatest investing and spending capital (ages 45-54). This means in as little as 8 years you are going to start to see the transition of millennials into peak spending/investing ages and start to push out gen X who is more ambivalent/mixed to the digital era. Baby boomers will be well into retirement and not be investing/spending and more living off their IRAs and pensions and their lack of familiarity and confidence of cryptocurrency will have little consequence. Thus in 8 years you will have gen Y enter their peak spending and investing and gen Z fill the next greatest category of spenders/investors(early career). 
The other key takeaway is that these age groups also shift from not only spending more but investing more which is critical. Lets look at the breakdown averages in the USA-
1) Less than 25 Years Old – $31,102 in spending (94.6%% of total income)
2) Between 25-34 Years – $48,928 in spending (**70.8%** of total income)
3) Between 45-54 Years – $64,781 in spending (**64.6%** of total income)
4) Over 75 Years Old – $40,211 in spending (95.6% of total income)
Notice from 25 to 54 these individuals have the most money not only to spend but also to invest. Baby boomers retiring are spending almost all their income surviving (healthcare) and/or vacationing and no longer investing. Once gen Y and gen Z dominate these 2 age brackets than a heavy bias towards Bitcoin will occur.

RAID 1 and a cron backup is recommended for these types of LN nodes for businesses. This is usually done anyways because many businesses use BTCpay on a server for accepting lightning and don't need to worry about power outages in the first place like the OP (data centers have batteries and backup generators) . Businesses with a lot of liquidity in their node need to take further steps than most consumers with lower liquidity of course, or simply use one of many lightning payment processors and not worry about it

Monero is unnecessary and far less scalable , and most DNM txs are in Bitcoin. 
personally I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi/samourai) than the base layer because:
1)	The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain.
2)	I want to use a coin where people can choose to be transparent or private
3)	In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
4)	privacy  tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs

Higher risk and lower market cap simply mean you allocate a smaller % of ones portfolio or reserve assets into Bitcoin. In fact since Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class you can actually reduce your risk profile with a 1-5% allocation and increase alpha.

The more tether is a scam (not 100% backed by BTC or leveraged) the less it effects Bitcoin. Also keep in mind the primary purpose of tether, providing liquidity to sketchy exchanges so that users can daytrade in altcoins. Tethers possible downfall will hurt Bitcoin, but hurt altcoins much more by drying up liquidity as many alts need tether to be purchased unlike with Bitcoin. 
TL;DR = Tether should be avoided but Bitcoin will be fine and survive this as we have with Mt Gox.

To fill users in. This wasn't due to a tx backlog but was a miner setting an unusually high tx fee amount which forces wallets that have a priority fee option to assume the possibility that the next block might be mined by this miner therefore in order to **almost** guarantee placement in the next block to conform to this higher fee .
Therefore , when using wallets pay attention to the highest fee before sending and in this case setting a normal priority would have gotten in immediately (as blocks were not full ).
In the future wallet developer could resolve this issue by changing their fee estimate to treat priority to mean getting in within 1 or 2 blocks(but most likely the first block ) to prevent miners creating mischief for the express purpose of collecting higher fees
FYI-- larger blocks would not help at all in this circumstance as the miner demanding a higher fee would mine the whole block whether it is 1MB , 2MB or 20MB

That is the target avg, but what makes it even more confusing is the actual average tends to be even less than 10 minutes due to hashrate increasing faster before each difficulty retarget over and over again .

This is a lie for many reasons. 
1) Bitcoin doubled the onchain block capacity in 2017. We no longer have 7TPS (1MB) limit but have 4 million units of weight or ~2MB blocks if mostly segwit txs are used.
2) Batching can occur where 1 onchain tx can represent hundreds of txs 
Here is the exact math  = 


3) This assumes Bitcoin doesn't change where many onchain (MAST, Schnorr sigs and future forks)  and 2nd layer solutions exist  (statechains, lighting payment channels, sidechains like liquid, eltoo)
4) You don't need to make an onchain tx to refill an established lightning channel , you can already buy BTC directly to your lightning channel without any onchain tx at all

It is far more likely they outlaw or restrict privacy coins (because they choose to market themselves as a privacy coin onchain instead of just giving users the option of privacy on wallets and other layers) as you can see here


4)	privacy  tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs
5) Schnorr/MAST incentives most wallets to coinjoin because coinjoin txs become cheaper than regular onchain transactions and lightning is designed to be extremely private from the get go. There is still an option to have transparency and give the allusion to regulators that they can track coins onchain however. 
6) Coinjoin with a wallet is private enough, Look at what an employee of leading coinanalytics company says about coinjoin -

Hopefully one day Bitcoin will be a better unit of account with less volatility. We can help this by having many buy limit orders on exchanges to increase Bitcoin buy limit support so when a whale tries to dump the market Bitcoin will barely move.

Segwit allows approximately double the amount of txs as before if 100 % of tx are segwit within a block or ~14 TPS (transactions per second) onchain average(keep in mind onchain throughput can increase beyond 14 TPS due to the poisson distribution in finding blocks or increases in hashrate)
It depends upon the transaction size, but for the theoretical current max without MAST or schnorr sigs here is the math
**12,195 transactions** per block max **without batching** (unlikely we will ever see this reached due to the variety of transactions within a block that are normally included.) Schnorr sigs and MAST can both increase these numbers though. Also transaction batching can greatly increase the amount of "transactions" per block as well, thus your question is a difficult one to answer because it really depends upon how you define a transaction.
I know your question includes batching so hopefully someone else will take my preliminary info and do the math

Additionally XMR has some huge scaliing problems and is being scrutinized by regulators and politicians and might get a huge liquidity problem soon(because they choose to market themselves as a privacy coin onchain instead of just giving users the option of privacy on wallets and other layers) as you can see here

Bitcoin only touched 20k in 2017 for a brief moment so almost no one bought in at this peak. But you could easily consider people buying in at the 2 previous bubbles in 2013 @ 1200 usd a BTC and 260 USD a BTC and ask them how they feel now.
The bottom line is that you should not expect to take profits or get rich in less than a year (For multiple reasons as you should avoid short term capital gains taxes as well ) , before investing BTC you should :
1) pay off all high interest debt 
2) have 3-6 months of fiat savings 
3) Do some research 
4) expect to take profits in 2-4 years at the earliest

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

1) Forget where the gold is secured or buried is akin to this concern . There is a reason why it is recommended to write down the 12/18/or 24 words on paper or metal as those can recover all your BTC without any need of a password so forgetting things is not a problem . 
2) The beauty of multisig or SSS is that you don't need to recover every fragment, some can be lost , stolen or destroyed and you still can recover your BTC unlike with gold and cash which doesn't even allow you this ability , someone finds your gold/cash they can steal it. 
3) It is always recommended you setup your wallet and record the seed word , tx small amount of btc , reset wallet , than recover it with the seed words to solve this concern. Additionally a typo in a seed word can easily be solved as a single wrong word can easily be brute forced if you do not follow the recommendation of testing your backup.  
4) people have misplaced gold because they have multiple hiding spots over the years ... how is this any different than multiple BIP 39 backups?
5) Family fights , stolen or destroyed gold/cash in a rage
6) Fake gold(tungsten) or fake bills 
7) HW wallets and or PSBTs  solve this concern 
8) HW wallets and or PSBTs solve this concern
9)  Sure , this is a concern that doesn't exist with physical gold, but there are other concerns like psyche in 2026 you should be aware of  .

Mining pools are made of many investors and separate miners. Miners do not control Bitcoin as was proven in 2017 with the segwit2x fiasco. The control of Bitcoin is dividing by many groups from miners, developers, exchanges, merchants, and economic users. Economic full nodes have the most control ultimately. Even if 100% of the hashrate gangs up on me and colludes to change the consensus rules my full node will simply ban them and reject their blocks as an automatic immune reaction.

Almost every one is a scam peddled to technically illiterate people who cannot evaluate the claims. Even the well intentioned creators accidentally become snake oil salesmen because they are selling tokens (illegal securities) without sufficient legal and technical knowledge that their project is futile. In almost everyone of these cases a token is useless , a blockchain not needed, and even worse selling an ICO makes the project even more likely to fail as it creates strong incentives for an exit , a pump and dump, and mis aligns incentives with a quick cash injection without the right qualified investors and protections in place.

Here are some much better options - 
**Best Advanced Bitcoin Wallet= Bitcoin Core**
Pros= Great privacy and security 
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires ~5GB minimum disk space if prunned
**Best High Privacy Bitcoin Wallet = Wasabi**
Pros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in 
Cons= mixing coins costs more fees 
**Best wallets for securing small amounts of BTC**
**electrum** For Desktop and Android
Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control 
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets, make sure you only upgrade from official sources like play store or  as malicious servers or adverts can tell you to upgrade malware from other sites
**Éclair** LN wallet for Android and desktop
Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees
Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental ,Some users may want to use other LN wallets. 
**hodlwallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Much better UX than other wallets and slick look as it’s a fork of the original Bread wallet
Cons- lacks some privacy features found in electrum 
**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration, RBF, HW wallet support and advanced 2fa options
Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers.

ICOs have almost nothing to do with Bitcoin. "Toxic" maximalists who hate scams drove away all these securities to other platforms for the most part. Why the hell would they assume a ban on ICOs would have much an effect on Bitcoin?


There isn't a predictive signal for investing in stocks or currencies either, unless you are an exchange, a whale, or  have some sort of inside trading knowledge that others lack. Bitcoin is no different. If you have more information than others you can use this information to profit more regularly than others. It appears that Selbert is merely an outsider so is bewildered.


One reason for greater uncertainty is bitcoin is so scarce and so illiquid that all it takes is a single millionaire or billionaire making a large buy in secret to move the market.

We have to agree on definitions first , and you don't like my definition of PoS even though it fits the criteria so we will just  talk past each other. If it makes you happy , I will suggest that fiat is a much different form of PoS than many altcoins, but there are many varieties  and differences between PoS altcoins themselves as well.


Permissioned , but open to competition if you have enough staking reward to run a fiat PoS "master node". Start your own bank today with the right forms and right amount of stake. The more stake you have the more "too big to fail" and benefits you will get as well.

A soft served hard fork is also known as an evil soft fork or a forced soft fork because it allows miners to essentially perform any changes to existing consensus rules found in a hard fork with a soft fork. This can be very coercive as unupgraded nodes would have no way to spend their btc or mine without "upgrading".
The benefit is  if you can get the community (economic users, exchanges, businesses , developers) to mostly agree to the upgrade before the forced soft fork than you can guarantee old nodes do not accept invalid txs to protect them while they decide to upgrade and it insures there will be a single chain moving forward (barring some group doesn't hard fork into an altcoin themselves in protest)

This is not a custodial LN wallet. This is a lite LN wallet for android. You control the private keys and do not need to trust any third party
Start testing now-
1- Enabling receive over Lightning with 2 week timeout window
2- Background watcher automatically warns you if fraud is attempted or you don't connect to internet at least once every 2 weeks . This watcher runs even if the app isn't started and will only bother the user if the cell has no internet for over 2 weeks
3-Inbound liquidity feature to automatically allow the wallet to receive 10, 25, or 50 mBTC (39 usd to 194 usd )
This means that if you have 39 cents of BTC you can receive 39 dollars just fine with this liquidity service.

The simplest way to use Bitcoin in the future will be to buy BTC directly from an exchange that sells to users lightning channel(already possible on  many exchanges) and use lightning which is extremely private by default. Some exchanges will not be private and some will be private DEX's but once the BTC leaves the exchange they will be hopeless in tracking the money.


not practically possible with lightning


Users will be unaware of how this tech helps their privacy, it will protect them without any effort and by default. Taproot and MAST will be used with lightning enabled wallets because it is critical to keep onchain costs low and efficient and censoring txs that open a payment channel impossible

You should never download wallets from untrusted sources.

Pro security tip for everyone -
Never click on a link in an email , ad or popup, as you can be directed to a different URL than you type. Accidentally clicking on a link might even infect you with a browser 0 day exploit.(although unlikely as most attacks require extra steps)
At most copy and paste the URL manually , but pay careful attention to the domain for misspellings. Much safer to go directly to the site with a bookmark or typing it in yourself. Phishing attacks can also be done over the phone by con artists misrepresenting themselves as a bank, IRS , or government employee thus if someone calls you asking for money or personal details than get their info , but never trust their callback number and simply lookup the the correct number for the department they say they are from and call back instead of talking to someone on an inbound call.
Unrelated security tip (especially for people in Bitcoin subreddits) - Be extremely careful of anyone trying to start a private chat with you via chat or DM or asking you to join a telegram group as there is an extremely high chance they are trying to scam you. The whole reason we have this subreddit is so new users can ask questions in the open so others can correct misinformation , give different opinions , and mods can clean up any offtopic material, sketchy info, or scams ... this all needs to be done with peer review and thus why scammers will try and have a private conversation with you.

Registered Value has its place in society and advantages(and tradeoffs) over Bearer assets.
Bitcoin is by default a bearer asset, but can be represented as registered value with multisig or custodial solutions.
volatility due to lack of liquidity is the primary reason bitcoin needs time.
This is why institutions like Fidelity and BAKKT are creating "sidechains" of Bitcoin. BAKKt is partnering with NYSE, MSFT, and starbucks not simply to allow institutional investors to speculate on Bitcoin but to create a "sidechain" that allows consumers to spend it with a custodial solution which would mimic registered value. There are some intrinsic risks if too much capital is tied up in a few custodial solutions but a small amount could be fine for wider adoption

If energy prices are increasing , if all other variables remain the same, the amount of electricity used to mine a block decreases. This is because miners will turn off unprofitable miners or upgrade their ASICs to more efficient ones if their principle capital costs (electricity) increases.
**In reality the cost of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin because difficulty dynamically adjusts and miners will not mine unprofitably for long. The amount of electricity used has no direct correlation with the price of Bitcoin**
Thus Bitcoin is very green because:
1) It competes in a free market and facilitates energy arbitrage , thus mining will typically always use the cheapest source of electricity . In this case it is mostly green energy from unused overbuilt hydroelectric energy in china and canada. Renewable energy with sunk costs tend to be better suited for mining whether hydro or geothermal 
2) ASICs are 99% efficient in converting electricity to waste heat and we are seeing a transition where this waste heat is being recycled for heating

Both investments are not mutually exclusive and one can make a very cogent argument that not having some exposure (1-5%) to BTC is reckless because it is an uncorrelated asset class. 
USD is a good short term store of value which slowly losses its purchasing power, thus is ideal for short term savings, day to day spending, or an emergency fund. 
BTC is a better long term store of value which is better suited for keeping its value with large swings in appreciation when one looks at investing at least 1-2 years minimum (One should wait at least 1 year of maturity regardless for long term capital gains classification)
Use the advantageous of each to the fullest.

A piece of paper does nothing to enforce ones rights . Many countries routinely ignore their own constitutions at their convenience and people need to struggle for their rights. Guns are not the only tool , but certainly an important tool and a backstop and reminder to tyrannical states. 


I agree that people should spend less time in the voting booth and more time with improving themselves and the local community. 


Guns alone sitting in a closet merely create the fear of a potentiality just like the ability to print guns these days to states. This does act somewhat as a deterrence when states decide to do unpopular actions that degrade individuals rights. This is not enough in itself however. In the case cited above encryption is a useful tool (specifically Bitcoin) in preventing these abuses, and not guns themselves. Draconian laws that degrade the rights of individuals to use encryption like found in Australia is even more alarming as that country also has a large problem with respecting peoples property rights and abuses asset forfeiture laws as well. thus weakening privacy rights is extra damaging. Guns would help empower individuals in Australia to secure themselves and their rights but is merely one tool among many.

Block Reward = coinbase reward + tx fees (not merely inflation from coinbase reward)
Large miners often have fixed electrical contracts or sunk costs in producing electricity which means they might not immediately remove ASICs if total reward drops. 
Of course if no one pays for security than Bitcoin does indeed have a problem, but security is far more nuanced than you make it out to be. 
There are even circumstances when total block reward drops but overall bitcoin is more secure. There are many variables to consider.

We have no idea whether electricity costs will increase or decrease in the future but this has no effect upon your concerns because there is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.
Watch this video -


Difficulty adjustment is dynamic up and down therefore it will always be profitable for some efficient miners to mine Bitcoin regardless the cost.


As inflation drops (coinbase reward) fees will pay to secure mining. We have already seen fees collected between 2-5 BTC per block for long sustained periods in the past which means we will likely start to see instances where tx fees are more of an incentive than coinbase reward/inflation for miners after the next having when coinbase reward drops to 6.25 BTC per block in 2020

Keep in mind that we are speaking about a hypothetical in the year 2140, and Bitcoin is still an evolving project so we don't know exactly how Bitcoin will develop and how popular it will become. 
Also keep in mind the amount of energy spent and the costs associated with this with Proof of Work is merely one aspect to Bitcoins security model. 
Thus it is more realistic to talk about, and make some hypothetical projections in the nearer future.  
So lets talk about what might happen in the next 15 years from now in 2034. 
Now lets make a conservative estimate that the price of appreciation of Bitcoin goes through one  10 x bubble per 4 years and than crashes 70% in a large correction in the subsequent year. This is assuming Bitcoins growth is rapidly slowing compared to the previous 10 years. Here is the drop in coinbase reward compared to the projected price. 
2020 Block reward drops to 6.25 BTC  = Price 9k USD x 10 - 70% = 90k to 27k USD per BTC the coinbase reward is between 562,500 to low of 
168,750 per block after the large crash
2024 Block reward drops to 3.125 BTC =Price 26k USD x 10 - 70% = 260k to 81k USD per BTC the coinbase reward is between 843,750 to low of 253,125 per block after the large crash
2028 Block reward drops to 1.5625 BTC =Price 81k USD x 10 - 70% = 810k to 243k USD per BTC the coinbase reward is between 1,265,625 to low of 379,687 per block after the large crash
For this next period , lets get even more conservative and assume much less growth occurs and Bitcoin becomes more stable and boring.
2032 Block reward drops to 0.78125 BTC = Price 243k USD x 5 - 50% = 1,215,000 to 607.5k USD per BTC the coinbase reward is between 949,218 to low of 474,609 per block after the large crash
Now lets compare what we have above to what we have right now. 
12 BTC coinbase reward x  8960 = 107,520 usd 
Thus you can see that in the short term while we are alive Bitcoin is likely going to become much more secure. But wait , it gets even better than this as I am not including tx fees as well which will increase and as we have already seen people were willing to pay 2-4 BTc of tx fees(in 2017 already achieved) easily per block so the above levels of security will likely more than double due to us seeing more collected in fees than in inflation from coinbase reward. 
Now lets discuss your question about a much different future where we will all be dead and our children mostly dead too after the year 2140 when no coinbase reward exists. 
Lets say Bitcoin blocks are very small 100MB(this is extremely big for now , but very small for bandwidth after 2140) in size because we want low latency between earth and colonists on Mars . 
Math time. 
Maximum amount of batched txs is 32,252 per block for ~2MB segwit blocks today without the soon to be upgraded improvements from MAST and Schnorr sig aggregation so lets add another 30% to this and be pessimistic that there will be no other improvements in 120 years (unlikely). Thus 41,927 tx per block at 2MB and 2,096,380 txs per block with 100MB segwit blocks(or 200m w/u). 
So lets assume that we want at least 10 million in todays USD to secure each block with 100% txs fees.(or much higher security in the future than now) These are not fees most users will pay but what exchanges and miners will typically pay as users will be mostly transacting on other layers as we are seeing being developed and used today (lightning, sidechains, eltoo, statechains). 
10 m USD / 2,096,380 txs = 4.77 USD (in todays value of USD) per settlement fee
10 million usd per block = 1,440,000,000 USD  per day in tx fee across 8 billion humans (assuming only part of our species will adopt Bitcoin as humanity will be larger than 8 billion) or **18 cents a day spent per human BTC user in tx fees** (This is the average, some people will spend less than a penny , others 30 cents)
Notice I say settlement fee here as users will be paying under a penny usd per tx and many of those txs will aggregate to settle larger batched txs that are amortized across all these users to pay for the larger onchain tx fee

TL;DR of current BTC privacy and future BTC Privacy. (there are many other technical nuances as to how the protocol is designed with privacy in mind that I will not list here as its a very long list and complicated)
BTC is pseudonymous , which means you get to decide whether you want to attach your identity to a tx/address or not. By default your identity is not associated with any address or tx
Most BTC wallets change the receive address with every transaction
Certain wallets like electrum and core have **coin control** to avoid mixing UTXOs
**Lightning Network** is extremely private by using **Sphinx**, an multihop onion-routing system and deliberately not broadcasting every tx to all nodes
Privacy focused wallets like Wasabi have sophisticated built in  Chaumian coinjoin and an anonymity set up to 100 unlike monero which has an anonymity set of less than 10 (to be fair , you cannot directly compare the 2 as there are nuanced differences however)
Privacy wallets like Samourai  has STONEWALL , PayNyms , Whirlpool coinjoin , and Ricochet privacy features
**Future Upgrades to Privacy likely occurring in 2020 or earlier**
**Schnorr signature aggregation** where **MuSig** leads to better privacy because verifiers don’t actually need to know the original participants’ public keys anymore - they can just be given the aggregated key instead.
**MAST** allows only executed smart contracts on Bitcoin are revealed, reducing the amount of other information that would otherwise be exposed. 
**Dandelion**  changes the way txs propagate thus making it extremely difficult for onlookers to decipher valuable information about the original node.
**Taproot**  this upgrade make regular and multisignature transactions look completely identical on the blockchain making it more difficult to identify details of txs

But he qualifies his statement suggesting its very risky. This was before the last bear market when Bitcoin was in a massive bull market so he appears to just be very ignorant about Bitcoin in general and following the latest trend and since we still have not reached past the previous ATH he thinks Bitcoin is over without doing his research 


This quote from him does have a sliver of truth in the sense that he seems to begin to understand the distinction and security threats of registered value vs bearer assets. Where his ignorance shines is with the fact that Bitcoin can be secured in manners where attacks and torture are ineffective unlike gold or jewelry. He also dishonestly leaves out the constant theft that occurs with registered value which is unavoidable and for the most part can be avoided with Bitcoin or Gold.

Yes, but privacy in other layers or in the wallet is better IMHO than onchain in many cases due to -
1)	The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain.
2)	I want to use a coin where people can choose to be transparent or private
3)	In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
4)	privacy  tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs
Privacy can and should be added onchain when the tradeoffs above aren't too much

Ohh , are you suggesting 1000% over 10 years is unreasonable for Bitcoin? I thought you meant per year. I would disagree. There are 3 halvenings between now and than, I would expect more than 1k% returns for the whole next 10 years. BTC would have an inflation rate of 0.5% and a mere 220.5 BTC mined a day in 10 years. Of course if you were expecting some altcoin to overtake BTC you would likely disagree and in such a case we are both speculating

Its not that it is less effective against the wealthy , but has 0 effect as the wealthy will not be buying on a local exchange regardless as that would drive up the price of BTC too quickly due to lack of liquidity. Wealthy people buy with OTC trades. This regulation cannot stop these OTC trades.
The argument is that they should focus on the most effective laws and regulations. Perhaps they are not doing this because they want to target the poor from hedging in BTC?

There is a directly coorelation between scalability and privacy. In most instances when scalability is improved , privacy is also improved. 
The reason is because to increase scalability(not merely capacity) you necessarily need to distribute less data to everyone thus improving Privacy.
Thus improvements like unidirectional channels , sidechains, schnorr signatures, and lightning network all improve both scalability and fungibility/privacy as a result.
I understand you are speaking about watchtowers specifically , but my comment applies to this topic as well as a general principle.

Agreed. The average layman in general doesn't care much about security and privacy. 


Just like how most people use custodial exchanges and wallets onchain for BTC right now which defeats many security assumptions and some of the principle reasons Bitcoin was created, doesn't mean that all is for naught. As long as a certain % of people control their own private keys and as long as a certain % of diversity of watchtowers remains decentralized than Bitcoin can be OK.


plenty of people will provide free and private watchtower service for others simply to support the network just as we see plenty of people donating their time and resources altruistically now in other areas. I'll be one of them...and we are motivated for selfish reasons as well because we are directly incentivized to insure Bitcoin is private and secure long term

Its a miner/RSK controlled drivechain , with a high tax and Bitmain is highly invested in. Smart Contracts or DAPPs in general are still a long way off from having any utility, if ever.

@_date: 2019-10-03 12:28:10
I believe Bitcoin is going to be over 1 million USD per BTC in value in the future. Around 2-4 million BTC have been permanently lost or burnt. This means that you have around 14 million to 16 million BTC will be fought over in the next few years , but many Bitcoin users are long term hodlers so at least half of those BTC are trapped in their savings. Thus you have a situation where 7-8 million BTC could potentially be purchased with ~2100 Billionaires in the world and at least ~36 million millionaires. If even a small percentage of these wealthy investors wanted to hedge 1-5% of their portfolio in Bitcoin they couldn't without dramatically increasing the value of Bitcoin. These days it is actually dangerous not to have at least 5% exposure to Bitcoin because it is an uncorrelated asset class and one needs a balanced portfolio.
Read this for more details - 
I have no plans on taking any profits(I am just going to spend and replace while keep increasing my BTC savings every year) for at least 8 years due to this -
There is a generational change occurring with not only investing but preference in banking and currency usage. 
millennial's and Generation Z grew up in the digital world and have little interest in investing in gold or silver and don't trust banks. People investing in gold and silver(or gold mining companies) I meet are typically in their late 40s or older. What is interesting about this shift is the key aspect of gold that these older gold bugs appreciate about their investment , being tangible and physical commodity that can be used and held physically , is the same thing that these 2 last generations reject and see as a burden or something that takes up space or inconvenient to store or secure.
Generation Y or Millennial's (born ~1982 to 2002) are now 37 to 17 and will begin to replace generation X as the new group with thee greatest investing and spending capital (ages 45-54). This means in as little as 8 years you are going to start to see the transition of millennial into peak spending/investing ages and start to push out gen X who is more ambivalent/mixed to digital era. Baby boomers will be well into retirement and not be investing/spending and more living off their IRAs and pensions and their lack of familiarity and confidence of cryptocurrency will have little consequence. Thus in 8 years you will have gen Y enter their peak spending and investing and gen Z fill the next greatest category of spenders/investors(early career).
The other key takeaway is that these age groups also shift from not only spending more but investing more which is critical. Lets look at the breakdown averages in the USA-
1) Less than 25 Years Old – $31,102 in spending (94.6%% of total income)
2) Between 25-34 Years – $48,928 in spending (**70.8%** of total income)
3) Between 45-54 Years – $64,781 in spending (**64.6%** of total income)
4) Over 75 Years Old – $40,211 in spending (95.6% of total income)
Notice from 25 to 54 these individuals have the most money not only to spend but also to invest. Baby boomers retiring are spending almost all their income surviving (healthcare) and/or vacationing and no longer investing. Once gen Y and gen Z dominate these 2 age brackets than a heavy bias towards Bitcoin will occur.

No. Proof of stake isn't a new concept and isn't secure. 
Fiat is essentially a form of proof of stake. 
1) ASIC's are actually extremely efficient at converting electricity to heat. 98-99% efficient. This heat can be recycled. 
2) Almost all mining is being done with renewable energy right now. Most principally unused hydroelectric in china that would simply go to waste without those ASIC farms capturing the energy
3) When comparing the energy used in mining to traditional fiat you must analyze all the energy consumed in regulation, auditing, accounting , building infrastructure , security, ect to fairly compare the 2 .

It is trivial to lend money even with a slightly deflationary currency. The reason BTC isn't ideal for lending **right now** is due to volatility. If BTC had mild steady deflation averaging 2% a year than the APR on loans would simply be 9% instead of 5% as an example to take into account inflation being ~2% for USD now. 
Thus Bitcoin could be a fine form of credit in the future as long as volatility continues to drop

2)	Not open source
3)	Lack of peer review
4)	Forces address reuse and lacks advanced features like RBF and privacy features
5)	allows insecure passwords
6)	Desktop apps without hardware wallets tend to be much less secure than mobile wallets

Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and than use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading - 
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying

GPU mining ended in early 2013 for bitcoin. You should only mine BTC if you do at least 100 hours of research -  
As mining is very professional 
understand difficulty  
Avoid cloud mining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI)
Use an accurate calculator like this and set at least 4% difficulty increment or higher- 
and only use modern ASICs like - 
Not following these guidelines means you will almost be guaranteed to lose money

I often pay a few pennies per tx onchain . And fees for ccs are not merely 3% , but 3% plus some minimum like 0.30 . My fees onchain are typically less than 30 cents . Regardless , other layers like lightning , eltoo , and statechains are specifically made for small txs

Hard drive capacity is the least of our concerns due to –
Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is ~202+GB for an archival node
Pruned nodes can get down to around ~5GB , and have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it (It actually prunes as it validates)
The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:
1)	Block propagation latency (causing centralization of mining)
2)	UTXO bloat (increases CPU and more RAM costs)
3)	Bandwidth costs 
4)	IBD (Initial Block Download ) Boostrapping new node costs 
5)	Blockchain storage (largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner)
This means we need to scale conservatively and intelligently. We must scale with every means necessary. Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains must be used.

Take this example - 
ethereum had a massive premine of 72 million Eths(Yes around 3/4 of all ethereum was created out of nothing in an instant) , 12 million went to the creators of ethereum and 60 million were sold off anonymously where the creators pocketed the free money as well. No one knows who bought those ethereum and it very well could have the development team of ethereum purchasing half or more of those 60 million ethereum with no risk to themselves(they are paying themselves BTC in doing so) and a very big benefit of locking up supply to manipulate the market and create more scarcity.

You will not get a non biased perspective from anyone regarding BCH and BTC . I am biased towards bitcoin so keep that in mind as I explain to you the differences - 
**Bitcoin (BTC) –**
99% of developer/specialist support
Far more hashrate - 
Larger community of users
99% of merchant support
Far less mining centralization
Far more node decentralization
Most devs Road map is for conservative scaling and focus on security , privacy and fungibility.
Current capacity allowance is 14 TPS (transactions per second) average with most txs using segwit and millions of txs per second for LN payment channels (used right now but awaiting GUI development finished for widespread use)
LN wallets we are testing right now –
**B Cash (BCH)**
One of 7 altcoin spinoffs from Bitcoin
Roadmap is focusing on cheap tx fees and many hard forks for larger capacity blocks at the risk of centralization and lower security.
Currently doesn't have transaction malleability fixed so is stuck with a mere 56TPS max throughput. Their focus is primarily on onchain scaling but do open the possibility up for L2.
Is still vulnerable to this PoW vulnerability -  which is largely neutralized in bitcoin with segwit
Still has not balanced UTXO costs and no plans to do so.
Introduced another vulnerability with the HF called EDA, They are attempting to fix this soon but due to lack of competent devs they will likely screw up again.

Andreas seems to place too much emphasis on Bitcoin Maximalism = Single platform or single currency worldwide which I think is absurd. I cannot think of one person who defines Maximalism in such a manner. 
Most Maximalists don't tend to suggest altcoins will dissapear, simply that they will become increasingly irrelevant because using them adds friction, costs, slippage, and risk. The reason why many fiat currencies exist is because this inefficiency is deliberately added to give local control to individual states at a cost. Whether it be loyalty points , local currencies, local fiat ... these will continue to exist and compete with BTC as it grows and eventually overtakes the USD as the reserve currency of trade and perhaps one day becomes the most stable unit of account.
Maximalists don't suggest that people should not have choice or be restricted from creating their own coin(remember with UASF many maximalists were going to create and follow a new chain even if it was a minority one.) The recognition that there will be one dominant currency (just like we have now with USD) is simply an understanding of economics regardless the benefits or tradeoffs.
Some misconceptions people have about maximalists-
1) maximalists do not suggest altcoins will cease to exist
2) many maximalists are perfectly happy to leave Bitcoin if it fails and support another chain
3) few maximalists suggest that fiat currencies or competing currencies will cease to exist at least anytime soon
4) maximalists do not suggest that it is inevitable that Bitcoin will become the dominant currency , simply that it is the most likely project at this time to fulfill this role (just like the USD is at this time). Bitcoin can indeed fail and is indeed an experiment

It is a misspelling from a drunken emotional rant that became a meme. Here is the original source - 
@_date: 2019-02-09 13:57:23
Yes, mostly anytime - 
Personally, I would suggest a portfolio allocation of a mix of SPDR index (sp500) + land + Bitcoin(at least 5% now) while maintaining at least 6 months of living expenses in fiat for most. Of course pay off all your high interest debts before investing as well.
 Bonds and CD's are now worthless asset classes as 5 year bonds don't even outperform inflation and anything longer barely beats inflation.
What is interesting here is this might be wise allocation for a senior 55+ where they need liquidity and want to reduce risk. I would readjust the allocation to 95% fiat + 5% BTC due to Bitcoin being much more secure than pre 2012 however.
This may seem controversial , but I would suggest that it is now irresponsible to not have at least 1% of ones portfolio invested in Bitcoin. The reason for this is one needs diversified and uncorrelated asset classes to hedge against themselves and reduce risk and since interest rates remain so low (and unlikely to be raised to acceptable levels anytime in the future) the traditional hedge of Bonds/CDs against stocks is no longer useful and ones needs other uncorrelated asset classes to take their place.

You are not investing in Bitcoin but a derivative with Robinhood. Robinhood buys and secures no Bitcoin when you buy this token thus your investment with Robinhood does not benefit the probability that Bitcoin will appreciate in value unlike with what Fidelity or Bakkt will be offering.

The bottom line is that when you do the math you cannot scale Bitcoin to be currency for the world all onchain securely so we need to design it efficiently where it scales in layers (like how the internet is designed)
The concern with larger blocks isn't so much related to hard disk space.
Hard drive capacity is the least of our concerns due to –
Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is ~200+GB for an archival node
Pruned nodes can get down to around ~5GB , and have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it (It actually prunes as it validates)
The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:
1)	Block propagation latency (causing centralization of mining)
2)	UTXO bloat (increases CPU and more RAM costs)
3)	Bandwidth costs 
4)	IBD (Initial Block Download ) Boostrapping new node costs

This means we need to scale conservatively and intelligently. We must scale with every means necessary. Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains must be used. 
The bitcoin blocksize was increased in 2017 from 1 MB of size to 4MB of weight (2MB in size if most txs are segwit) . Bitcoin has gone from a network ~7 transactions per second limit and confirmations taking between a second to hours (10 min avg Poisson distribution curve) to ~14 TPS onchain **average** limit without batching and millions of TPS with instant and secure confirmations with LN channels.

Blockchain.com wallet has a long history of having bugs and security problems , horrible UX problems such as allowing 0fee txs , malleated txs , sending unconfirmed inputs . lacks segwit , so tx fees are much higher
The company lately have also been contradicting itself and misleading users.
I have been telling people to avoid them for over 3 years.
**Wallet recommendations:**
Store it in a segwit wallet for better security and much less expensive transaction fees.
**Wallets with segwit:** armory, trezor, ledger, Green address , Greenbits, Samourai wallet , core (manually) , and electrum 3.0(currently not compatible with win 7 and 8)
If you use an insecure OS like windows or OSX and cannot afford a HW wallet store your BTC in Samourai wallet, Green address , Greenbits  or electrum 3.0 on a cell phone.
Green address and Greenbits are both excellent wallets with segwit but since have 2 of 2 multisig aren’t the first choice to go for if you want to easily split your coins for the segwit2x split 
If you have a lot of bitcoins you will want to use either paper wallets or hardware wallets.

You have a choice in Bitcoin with being transparent or opaque . These are the reasons why I prefer this arrangement on the base layer -
I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning, or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi) than the base layer because:
1)	The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain. With certain privacy coins like monero their inflation resistance relies faith in the future of ECC security which might need to be upgraded in the future thus casting serious doubts on an inflation bug existing undetected.
2)	It is important to give users the option of transparency and audibility onchain, at least for accounts they choose to expose. 
3)	In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
It is far more likely they outlaw or restrict privacy coins (because they choose to market themselves as a privacy coin onchain instead of just giving users the option of privacy on wallets and other layers) as you can see here


4)	privacy  tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs and much higher resource demands leading to more centralization and greater inefficiencies.
5) Schnorr/MAST incentives most wallets to coinjoin because coinjoin txs become cheaper than regular onchain transactions and lightning is designed to be extremely private from the get go. There is still an option to have transparency and give the allusion to regulators that they can track coins onchain however. 
6) Coinjoin with a wallet is private enough, Look at what an employee of leading coinanalytics company says about coinjoin - 
Read this - 


7)	Here is a presentation on how Taproot can allow for UTXOs with untraceable swaps and indistinguishable payment channels. Taproot allows privacy txs to share the same anonymity set as regular onchain transactions thus eliminates the concerns with everyone forced to opt into a privacy Bitcoin wallet to have a larger anonymity set.
 
8)	Privacy is a complex topic that has many nuances. Many privacy coins have lower tx fees(Bitcoin has lower tx fees on other layers) than Bitcoin onchain(mainly because they are hardly used and have low value) . Lower onchain tx fees can lead to the risk of very inexpensive attacks to deanonymize users as well. Bitcoin being designed where onchain fees will grow to cover the cost on security (and as explained privacy)  and inexpensive txs occur on other layers(that are very private like lightning which is multihop and onion routed by default which makes coin analytics practically impossible) is the better balanced solution IMHO.

Why are you changing the topic when I am discussing a reasonable compromise?


This isn't true. Bitcoin difficulty is dynamic thus insuring efficient miners remain profitable, many professional miners have fixed upfront investments and sunk costs and contracts, miners often hedge their investments to protect against downturns, miners are often diversified in other ways to profit from selling asics to running an exchange , etc..

Ok, Yes , I think you are right. They are re-balancing their ratio's every year 99% to 1%. If they kept their original BTC and let it ride the whole time increasing their returns and risk it would only need to appreciate ~100% per year on average. 
I think it is reasonable to assume at least 3 more 10x bubbles over the next 10 years on the conservative side(remember 2017 we saw ~20x which far overshot everyone's expectations of a 5-12x bubble ) thus they might be looking at 3.5k to 35k - 80% = 7k to 70k -80% = 14k , 14k to 140k per BTC is sill lowered than their projections of a 350k usd BTC . So they are expecting more bubbles than 3 in the next 10 years 
Another issue is that I believe BTC is far less risky than pre 2012 thus one needs to account for less risk and less returns as well so a 95 to 5 ratio would be better

**Bech32 native segwit (P2WPKH and P2WSH ) (Addresses that start with BC1)**
**Pros** -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~39-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
**Pros** -
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
**Cons** -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32
**Legacy P2SH Addresses (some addresses that start with 3, common with multisig addresses)**
**Pros** - 
1)	Like P2SH-segwit addresses compatible with all addresses and most wallets
**Cons** - 
1) 26 -58% higher fees than using a segwit transaction for the same priority
2) larger txs than segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32
**Legacy P2PKH Addresses (some addresses that start with 1)**

Typos in wallets will get a response that it is an invalid address in wallets. It is extremely unlikely to type in a valid address that is not yours by mistake because of the checksum. With bech32 standard addresses can be designed to not only detect a typo like the older checksums but also tell the user where the typo is. Native segwit(bech32) also is all lower case to make typing it easier and make telling someone over the phone/verbally easier.

Not all altcoins are scams, Ethereum is.


This is 100% false and not how ethereum was sold to investors. Please cite me where Vitalik before the launch was talking about delaying the difficulty bomb if they needed more time. The whole promise of the difficulty bomb was to insure that PoW mining would become increasingly more difficult to force the transition at a certain date even if developers wanted more time


There are many things that are madness and many ridiculous design decisions in Ethereum like leaving checksums out of original address types , Gavin not getting simple multisig right, and picking a state model instead of UTXO model


Ethereum had a 72 million premine unlike a 100% PoW coin where a centralized business sold securities to investors. Promises were made and broken. 


my main problem with ethereum is inherent in how ridiculous the whole concept of "turing complete" code on a blockchain is because there is no censorship risk in  code execution... all the lies and scamming just makes it worse

That is not how the OED works, the OED has 3 definitions of the term fiat and the complete etymology with prescient variations throughout time . The OED will always use the original recorded use of that definition in history discovered with etymology for each of those definitions
You can assume some previous unrecorded usage of the term fiat but you are just making assumptions when I am going by the official records that is supported by evidence to draw my conclusions
This means the first recorded definition of fiat was in 1636, the second definition first instance used was in 1631, and the third use case was in 1880

Privacy will be a natural consequence of people choosing wallets that have low fees and instant confirmations. People won't use lightning wallets for privacy but they will get it.
As far as onchain is concerned , Schnorr/MAST incentives most wallets to coinjoin because coinjoin txs become cheaper than regular onchain transactions . Users won't pick these wallets because they are private for the most part but will get this as an added benefit.
Taproot allows privacy txs to share the same anonymity set as regular onchain transactions thus eliminates the concerns with everyone forced to opt into a privacy Bitcoin wallet to have a larger anonymity set.

The ease of use and adoptability of any one solution is a different matter than scalability. When I refer to scalability I am referring to the resource needs and network efficiency. What you are describing is a UX issue that can be polished to automatically be created with a single click. FYI- watchtowers don't need to run unpruned full nodes btw. 
Some of what you suggest is correct. As a single watchtower with eltoo can scale O(1) per user and is basically limited by the UTXO set itself(can service almost everyone) thus potentially less private and more scalable than everyone having their own watchtower. Thus the exception to the general correlation I cite, but if everyone's watchtower was servicing everyone else instead of just their own channels this would be an example of a network that is less scalable, less private, and more (albeit unnecessary) redundant. (tradeoffs, but reinforcing the correlation I cite between scalability and privacy)

Its not simply a matter of casa using multisig thus an inherent bias as the points therein are correct and acknowledged by many people.
IMHO multisig is easier to use than SSSS, the one benefit of SSSS has over multisig is exchanges can have a consistent security policy of using SSSS for all their altcoins and bitcoin, so I agree with you insomuch as SSSS is easier if you need to secure many different types of alts.  Since I'm not and exchange and don't use altcoins this advantage has no bearing upon me.

While not initially, It intentionally became one of many scaling/capacity solutions when Luke discovered how to soft fork in a blocksize increase. The rest of the developers instantly became very excited for this as a scaling solution

Saving fiat is still common and recommended , especially with older people. Inflation is a tax on them. 


Everyone should invest in stable forms of fiat, at least for an emergency fund of 3-12 month in living expenses. Perhaps you don't call this an  "investment" but the  reality is inflation is taxing these assets regardless. Some Studies reflect that an inflation target of 0% is optimal, which of course is nearly impossible to achieve , but instead of 2-6% like many countries target it is reasonable to target 0% and achieve a window of  -1% to 1% IMHO 


Bitcoin is testing many principles in economics and doesn't belong to any one particular school of economic theory. Keynes for example had many nuanced and diverse views, some of which even would agree with those who advocate for Austrian economics

There is no cherry picking here because you can see every data point during Bitcoins complete history - 
A more valid criticism would be to suggest that the past historical returns of Bitcoin are unlikely to continue at the same rate, which is true. What is also true is Bitcoin is a far safer asset than Pre 2012 as well and its still in an early adoption phase so has a tremendous potential for future appreciation. Thus one would adjust for these changes by adjusting ones exposure to 95% Fiat and 5% Bitcoin going forward. 
FYI - I believe in this interview they suggested rebalancing ones portfolio allocation every year to keep the 99% to 1% ratio

you are cherry picking part of a definition and ignoring the reality that most people think "government decree currency" or "nation state currency" when they hear fiat


Intrinsic value in context of speaking about currency usually means -
1) melt value of the underlying PM or value intrinsic to the currency outside of its utility of a currency 
If you  use this definition than Bitcoin does not fit well because -


Bitcoin only lacks "intrinsic value" here is you narrow the definition to lacking specie or being digital instead of physical. So yes, Bitcoin shares this quality with fiat. 
2) intrinsic utility 
This is so broad because everything has intrinsic utility 
So your focus more has to do with Bitcoin being digital instead of physical which is very broad way to categorize it as "fiat" because many useful things we use daily are digital
@_date: 2019-12-16 15:56:44

The US has record GDP, low unemployement, low inflation, and other fiat currencies are dropping in value relative to it. 
My country had to sell off all their reserve currency in 2018 just to help keep their fiat from sliding further than 520 to 640 colones a dollar because the US economy is doing so well and our reserve assets were in dollars as well so we are taxed with your inflation to boot. 
If you just focus on the concerns within the US, plenty, you will not get a wider picture of all the economic concerns elsewhere and the US just has to do  slightly better than other countries and this is easy to do because the US dollar is the largest reserve asset so everyone else it subsidizing the US economy via inflation

Others are right about many nocoiners losing their  gifted private keys but at least this becomes a donation to everyone else by slightly raising the scarcity of our BTC
Several ways to gift btc - 
1) If you have a coinbase account , you can simply send btc via Email, even if he doesn't have an account, and if he doesn't claim it it will automatically come back to you in 60 days 
2) Create a paper wallet and gift it to him . Paper wallet should be 12 or 24 word seed phrase and not the obsolete standard that includes a BTC private key
3) Buy a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor and place some btc on it and give to him 
4) Consider more secure means of backing up your 12 or 24 BIP39 backups in case of floods or fire - 
Or 
or  or 
or a metal backup plate like safe seed
and than load up a wallet with btc that you backup to it 
5) Buy a btc physical coin that you send btc to -
 In person or bulk only 500 for 0.39 BTC
 105 USD - ~2k USD
 various prices
 179 to 339 USD per coin
 19.9 € to 2199 € per coin

Withdraw them to your hardware wallet


No, you can always spend them in a lightning channel later or coinjoin them with wasabi later for privacy


Electrum personal server (uses bitcoin core full node) + HW wallet + electrum on mobile phone


most people run several types of wallets with different security thresholds for security/convenience tradeoffs. The most secure and private hot wallets is using a full node + hw wallet though


Do not reuse addresses , use a full node, use a lightning wallet when you can , and coinjoin any btc you buy off an exchange that you don't plan on using in a lightning channel
**Best High Privacy Bitcoin Wallet = Wasabi**
Pros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in 
Cons= mixing coins costs more fees 
For best privacy you can run electrum personal server and tor
What you want to do is setup a direct SSH tunnel-
Here is a guide to setup electrum personal server -
Your home ISP uplink will not be able to see anything but encrypted data. If you are even more paranoid you can host the EPS(Electrum Personal Server) at home or your own cabinet with your own server in a datacenter
Electrum works with ledger and trezor hardware wallets as well.

Basically, buy from an exchange, withdraw , than use wallets like wasabi

I love me some privacy and fungibility but prefer most of it to occur on layer 2 as long as layer one can mask the txs onboarding the base layer for these reasons -
1)	The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain. With certain privacy coins like monero their inflation resistance relies faith in the future of ECC security which might need to be upgraded in the future thus casting serious doubts on an inflation bug existing undetected.
2)	It is important to give users the option of transparency and audibility onchain, at least for accounts they choose to expose. 
3)	In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
It is far more likely they outlaw or restrict privacy coins (because they choose to market themselves as a privacy coin onchain instead of just giving users the option of privacy on wallets and other layers) as you can see here


4)	privacy  tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs and much higher resource demands leading to more centralization and greater inefficiencies.
5) Schnorr/MAST incentives most wallets to coinjoin because coinjoin txs become cheaper than regular onchain transactions and lightning is designed to be extremely private from the get go. There is still an option to have transparency and give the allusion to regulators that they can track coins onchain however. 
6) Coinjoin with a wallet is private enough, Look at what an employee of leading coinanalytics company says about coinjoin - 
Read this - 


7)	Here is a presentation on how Taproot can allow for UTXOs with untraceable swaps and indistinguishable payment channels. Taproot allows privacy txs to share the same anonymity set as regular onchain transactions thus eliminates the concerns with everyone forced to opt into a privacy Bitcoin wallet to have a larger anonymity set.
 
8)	Privacy is a complex topic that has many nuances. Many privacy coins have lower tx fees(Bitcoin has lower tx fees on other layers) than Bitcoin onchain(mainly because they are hardly used and have low value) . Lower onchain tx fees can lead to the risk of very inexpensive attacks to deanonymize users as well. Bitcoin being designed where onchain fees will grow to cover the cost on security (and as explained privacy)  and inexpensive txs occur on other layers(that are very private like lightning which is multihop and onion routed by default which makes coin analytics practically impossible) is the better balanced solution IMHO.

If you buy with coinbase you can lock in the rate . Withdrawing through gdax allows you to avoid any tx fees . 
If you use a segwit wallet that allows you to manually select the fee you can get away with paying 5-10 cents per tx .
Wallet recommendations:
Store it in a segwit wallet for better security and much less expensive transaction fees.
Wallets with segwit: armory, trezor, ledger, Green address , Greenbits, Samourai wallet , core (manually)
If you use an insecure OS like windows or OSX and cannot afford a HW wallet store your BTC in Samourai wallet, Green address , Greenbits on a cell phone. If you have a lot of bitcoins you will want to use either paper wallets or hardware wallets.
Paper wallets are not for beginners but if you want to educate yourself read this-
If you need a multi currency wallet the only three secure ones available now are ledger , trezor and digital bitbox .

Everything you are saying is related to onchain  fees that are not going to be used for everyday txs. A single onchain tx can represent thousands of layer 2(lightning, sidechains,drivechains,statechains,offchain) txs.

Exchanges can sell people BTC directly in  an existing  lightning channel as well

Andreas seems to place too much emphasis on Bitcoin Maximalism = Single platform or single currency worldwide which I think is absurd. I cannot think of one person who defines Maximalism in such a manner.
Most Maximalists don't tend to suggest altcoins will dissapear, simply that they will become increasingly irrelevant because using them adds friction, costs, slippage, and risk. The reason why many fiat currencies exist is because this inefficiency is deliberately added to give local control to individual states at a cost. Whether it be loyalty points , local currencies, local fiat ... these will continue to exist and compete with BTC as it grows and eventually overtakes the USD as the reserve currency of trade and perhaps one day becomes the most stable unit of account.
Maximalists don't suggest that people should not have choice or be restricted from creating their own coin(remember with UASF many maximalists were going to create and follow a new chain even if it was a minority one.) The recognition that there will be one dominant currency (just like we have now with USD) is simply an understanding of economics regardless the benefits or tradeoffs.
Some misconceptions people have about maximalists-
1) maximalists do not suggest altcoins will cease to exist
2) many maximalists are perfectly happy to leave Bitcoin if it fails and support another chain
3) few maximalists suggest that fiat currencies or competing currencies will cease to exist at least anytime soon
4) maximalists do not suggest that it is inevitable that Bitcoin will become the dominant currency , simply that it is the most likely project at this time to fulfill this role (just like the USD is at this time). Bitcoin can indeed fail and is indeed an experiment
BTC maximalists tend to believe some altcoins are not scams like grin, ltc, monero, namecoin, and others. This does not mean they want anything to do with these altcoins. Some maximalists use and invest in these , others just want to focus on Bitcoin. There are literally only a few exceptions to this with JWW calling everything a scam but BTC , and some people like Luke calling LTC a scam (but I doubt he considers everything but BTC a scam). Most "maximalists" tend to simply want to focus on Bitcoin though and fall under the description I present , not the caricature that Andreas refers to.
@_date: 2019-02-20 00:10:57


Agreed , there is a spectrum and some exceptions


This is the point I am making. Many of these people that Andreas refers to that argue with him about supporting scams have the same views I present above. I know most of these people on twitter and Andreas is merely assuming their viewpoint not understanding they have similar nuanced views. 


Yes, this does not refute any of my statements. Stable fiat like USD and Euros are very useful tools in this transition period. Hopefully BTC will one day become liquid enough to be as good of a unit of account and until than it is completely reasonable to use fiat and BTC


Acknowledging scam projects exist and scammers exist does not mean to suggest that we think they will disappear. People will keep gambling with altcoins and scaming each other. Altcoins will come and go(become irrelevant) as we have seen many times in the past

Correct , but economic deflation is also caused by demand exceeding available supply. 
The key here is to separate **economic inflation/deflation** from **monetary inflation/deflation**
Fiat is almost always inflationary economically (in the market) and as a monetary policy. 
Bitcoin is **disinflationary** till 2140 from a monetary policy and than has 0 inflation thereafter. In the market Bitcoin historically has been  highly deflationary (bull market)  or highly  inflationary(bear market)

Unlikely any fiat will be 100% reserve in the future. More likely fiat will just start to transition away from gold or another countries fiat(indirect fractional gold with a small inflationary fee payable to said country) as their fractional reserve in part or all in BTC
The economics are such that they might not have a choice in these matters either. Look into what happened to the economies  of countries that used silver instead of gold as their reserve asset

Of course we will not see 50 TPS anytime soon but Onchain capacity "limits" is useful to understand how one can make improvements to optimize , like coinbase batching txs like cash app does as an example. Further onchain demand will push for these optimizations like batching, schnorr/mast, segwit usage, etc... 
In 2017 there were no L2 tx solutions in mainet use, so fees will remain low for those that use L2 solutions in the future if Bitcoin has another appreciation bubble.

It depends upon the definition of currency. I use the term "reboot" to reflect that there is a major failure on average every 27 years or the currency is completely changed to a new standard, or is abandoned. 
Lets take the USA as an example. 
1) Pennsylvania Colony Notes - abandoned and replaced
2) Continental Currency promissory notes - - abandoned and replaced
3) many private bank notes issued by private banks - abandoned 
4) Confederate  dollars - abandoned after the civil war
5) Currency backed by 100% gold and silver on demand - replaced by partial fiat in 6
6) Currency backed partially by gold and silver - replaced by full fiat in 7
7) No obligation to back any of the currency, 100% fiat (but the USA still has a little gold to protect itself as a reserve asset)
Thus every time a country like Argentina or Venezuela have a hyper inflationary moment  = failure of currency 
Everytime there is a large government seizure like the bail in of cypress = failure of currency 
every failed currency like canadas mint chip, venesuela petrodollar , or Ecuador's cryptocurrency = failure of a currency  
To be fair , you  could correctly suggest that Bitcoin has failed multiple times due to hyperinflation ... I would suggest its even worse than this due to volatility and lack of acceptability, Bitcoin is quasi a currency today and acts more like an speculative asset. 
I am not trying to suggest I prefer this to be the case as I use BTC as a currency and believe it will mature in due time once volatility drops with more liquidity. I just want to be honest about the reality we now face and what work needs to be done.

The cybertruck is a masterpiece in design where form follows function. Other automakers have been salivating at creating X/Y oragami designs to reduce production costs(complex stamping and painting) and increase space and strength but no one had the courage to do so until now.
Some key aspects-
1- the triangle shape great increases aerodynamics 
2- not having a bed on frame reduced towing capacity compared to other unibody trucks like ridgeline suffers from and the shape makes up for this reduction 
3- More in bed capacity
4- Allows you to use stronger materials like cold rolled stainless steel and "metal" glass. You cannot easily stamp this steel 
5- allows them to standout in a crowd of entrenched brands with strong loyalty 
6- plenty of free marketing ... we are talking about it as you can see and everyone else is too 
7- All other trucks now seem dated and old stylistically while cybertruck looks modern even if its too modern and you hate the look 
The biggest concerns with this truck is the fact that the advertised range will be 1/3rd when you actually tow something so this truck is not for everyone.(If you live in wyoming and need to tow a boat long distances definitely don't get one.)

I agree that some pro-gun people in the US treat guns as a panacea for most security which is a very dangerous way of looking at matters .

I envy the rights the people in the USA have and will continue to fight for these rights in my home country of Costa Rica(which is much safer than most countries in central and south america but you would be foolish to not be armed here).

Privacy is a spectrum , and bitcoin can be private enough if used right. 
just withdraw to a regular wallet before sending to wasabi
If exchanges start blacklisting users that indirectly have taint from characteristics of possible coinjoin than excellent, their clients will start using DEXs and other exchanges who do not penalize them
I look forward to the day when most addresses have "taint" in them, this is what we want for fungibility
Simply using a coin like Monero won't help because exchanges will start delisting these coins if they are trying to enforce AML/KYC
In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
It is far more likely they outlaw or restrict privacy coins (because they choose to market themselves as a privacy coin onchain instead of just giving users the option of privacy on wallets and other layers) as you can see here

The correlation between larger txs(thus larger tx fees) has more to do with dust (you received many small txs into your wallet instead of a single one) and nothing to do with the value of the tx directly (although very valuable txs typically are larger because they need to cover multiple inputs to fund the total amount, but not necessarily)
Thus a tx of 1 million usd in BTC can technically have a lower tx fee (because the weight/size is smaller ) than a BTc tx worth 50 USD (because its filled with dust)
Here is some advice:
1) Batching when you can (electrum and core wallets has sentomany built in )
2) send from native bech32 segwit addresses (your BTC address starts with bc1) 
3) Follow the fee market and manually set thee right priority 
4) Make sure you use a wallet that uses RBF (Replace by fee) so you can easily bump the fee if need be. Examples are Bitcoin core, electrum, blockstream green, so you can set the fee very low manually and than bump it up as needed

I respectfully disagree, 0% should be a target with a realistic window of -1% to 1% realized. I understand this is a heated and complex debate however. 
Here is the evidence in a comprehensive study which supports this - 


One example of an exception is for fiat currencies which are used as reserve assets/currencies like USD worldwide which allows for low inflation to tax the rest of the world for the benefit of the people of that nation.

Sorry you lost your job and going through hard times. Some lessons-
1) In your position you likely should not have been "investing" in Bitcoin at all. Unless all high interest debt is paid off and you have at least a 3-6 month fiat savings account its not a good idea to invest in Bitcoin. **you can use Bitcoin for its utility(like saving 15-20% off amazon), just not speculate on it**
2) Now is the time to take a negative life experience and turn it into a positive. You have a tremendous opportunity to cut expenses and make a budget and a life plan. This experience can make you lean and focused and prepared for a strong return.
**The choice is yours to either stay depressed or use this pain to make yourself stronger. Rise up comrade, we are all cheering for you in solidarity**

I prefer institutional investors to continue to buy BTC with family offices. I have always been concerned with large institutions like exchanges or BAKKT holding too many UTXOs. BAKKT suggests that they will eventually offer "physically" settled BTC and this is just an introductory product but the longer they delay this the better IMHO. Gives me more time to accumulate BTC.

Robin hood is a horrible way to buy Bitcoin because -
1) You cannot  withdraw Bitcoin thus have no idea if you are actually buying any 
2) not your keys , not  your  bitcoin
3) they have a large spread  because low liquidity 
Use a real exchange like gemini, bisq, coinbase pro, kraken, bitstamp, cash app instead and withdraw your btc  after buying it
2% volatility isn't very volatile for Bitcoin regardless , 5-10% is a very volatile day

Excellent. 
Here is other research that supports the same conclusions -
@_date: 2019-12-16 13:51:21
If you aren't a developer than here are ways to contribute.
1) educate yourself more-
2) Run an economic full node - 
3) Possibly mine with an ASIC after doing 100 hours of research - 
4) Perform translations-
5) write documentation 
6) Start a blog , or write articles on medium about bitcoin. 
7) Participate more on social media websites and forums educating others 
8) Attend local meetups and discuss Bitcoin IRL
9) Sell Bitcoin locally
10) manage a bitcoin atm 
11) Set various buy limit orders (In addition to buying Bitcoin at regular intervals)  on an exchange you use with deposited fiat. This will decrease Bitcoin's volatility by increasing buy limit support which is critical to both investor confidence and Bitcoin maturing into a stable currency and a less volatile unit of account. The side benefit is you can auto pickup any dips and save money.
12) Help answer new user questions on r/BitcoinBeginners
13) Help test open source bitcoin software by reporting any bugs you find to the developers. Most projects have a github page which has an issue tracker.
14) Donate to open source bitcoin projects and other bitcoin-related volunteer efforts.
15) Provide liquidity in joinmarket
16) Provide liquidity on Bisq
17) Buy Bitcoin and securely store it
18) Spend money (BTC) with merchants that accept Bitcoin and replace the spent BTC. Better yet , go to a bar or restaurant that accepts Bitcoin with friends and family and pay the bill with Bitcoin in front of them to show them how easy it is.

The point is you are using the term fiat to denote something that lacks "intrinsic value" whether its a digital currency or paper one like BerkShares (local private currencies are not new and existed long before BTC). 
"Intrinsic value" to you must mean without a physical commodity matching its value backing it because I already explained how Bitcoin is not  just a currency but derives value as an asset in multiple ways so you are not using that definition of "intrinsic value". 
I am explaining why lack of "specie" or physical commodity backing a currency isn't going to be a useful term now or the future as only a few gold bugs even dream of this happening and gen Y and Z prefers things that are digital and has little interest in investing in PMs

200k is on the edge as people ussually use the OTC markets when buying over 250k of BTC 
If you are not using an OTC market than you will need an account with coinbase pro but with have initial restrictions that you can in time raise to over 20k USD a week worth of buying.

Another thing you can do is open accounts with kraken , coinbase pro, and gemini , and cash app to increase your weekly spending limits but some OTC markets allow for 100k minimum

I agree the US has plenty of problems as well but relatively speaking they are better off than most countries for now. 


Many Austrian economists have repeatedly gotten this wrong , despite getting so much right. Fiat currency has no real competition right now because currencies like Bitcoin are so volatile thus not stable units of account so don't directly compete with them. Thus fiat currency serves a crucial role in society for the time being and one must compare the relative strength of each against others and the US dollar is looking very strong right now.

Bitcoin is useful for people to speculate with. 
Bitcoin is useful for regulatory arbitrage. Not possible with fiat unless work for the cartel and can bribe banks like HSBC and even that its limited
Bitcoin is useful for microtipping as I do this all day and cannot with fiat. Can you tip small fractions of a penny with Zelle?
I can easily send payments internationally which I do. Higher fees with fiat and restrictions for many countries
Bitcoin is useful for capital flight. Not possible with fiat easily
Bitcoin is useful for timestamping. Better timestamping than using Notary
Bitcoin is useful for smart contracts like multisig and more. Making certain forms of fraud impossible and offering better security 
Bitcoin saves me 15-20% off amazon and discounts from many other stores. Arbitrage amazon points and giftcards
Bitcoin is useful to avoid civil and asset forfeiture. Even fiat cash is at risk due to inspections and money sniffing dogs.

I would suggest either sending that fiat to your bank account or spending it directly on ebay or another service and than buying Bitcoin with your debit card or bank account on cash app or a regular exchange like coinbase pro.
You get really close to spot price 0.5% to 1.7% buying this way instead of 20-30% premium
If you must insist on buying Bitcoin in the most inefficient manner possible than use purse.io as an option to buy btc if you have a paypal debit card otherwise

1) Setup electrum personal server(this is your full node) on that linux box 
 
2) Use electrum with your nano s and configure electrum to use your personal server you setup above (Full node plus HW wallet) -
ledger nano S crash course:
3) Record your 24 words on paper + record your passphrase on a separate paper you keep private and secure and separate from your hardware wallet and each other. You will both memorize your passphrase and pin + keep it in writing but not with your 24 word backup. Never store passphrase or mnemonic backup digitally. 
Consider upgrading to metal backup - 
4) Withdraw a small test amount of BTC from coinbase pro(not coinbase) to your receive address on your electrum + ledger wallet. You can tx those btc from coinbase to coinbase pro for free with deposit button in coinbase pro than withdraw from coinbase pro to avoid any overcharged withdraw fee. You are going to send BTC to your hidden wallet with the passphrase.
5) Confirm you got the BTC, reset your ledger nano S, recover it with 24 words + passphrase . Now you have trained yourself how to recover a wallet with backup and 100% confident you did everything right once you see the BTc again in your hidden wallet. 
6)	Send a small amount of BTC to your non hidden wallet(protected by pin) , and the rest to your hidden wallet(protected by passphrase). Done and send more BTC to hidden wallet account addresses.

**Some foundational Principles of security**
If you don't own much value in Bitcoin these principles are not for you. There is no one solution and most people have different risk profiles and make multiple trade offs in a risk vs convenience spectrum. 
1) **Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**
2) Diversify your BTC storage either split between multiple wallets from small spending amounts in a smart phone for convenience to one or multiple hardware wallets. The more Bitcoin you have the more you should begin to consider using multiple hardware wallets and BIP39 paper wallets and or multisig 
3) Buy your hardware wallet directly from the producer or amazon site under the producers name. Verify the integrity of the hardware wallet if you are extra paranoid :
4) Never brag about your wealth to others 
5) Never invest in any investment scheme or get greedy thinking you can quickly increase the amount of Bitcoin you have with daytrading
6) Consider more secure means of backing up your 12 or 24 BIP39 backups in case of floods or fire - 
Or 
or  or 
or 
Use steel , brass, or copper or other durable metals. Wood and aluminum are unacceptable.
7) Setup your hardware wallet , transfer a small amount of btc to it, wipe it clean , and restore it to give you confidence that the backup was done right and give you experience in the recovery process.
8) Keep your Mnemonic 12 or 24 word seed secret and private and show to no one.  Never use premade 12-24 word backups , you create new keys and backups upon setup. 
9) Lastly **Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**
10) Do not store these digitally
11) At minimum secure the backup 12/18/24 words on paper in a sealed plastic bag to protect against moisture or flooding. Do not laminate as certain adhesives can damage the ink.
12) Pin you will just store in memory as that is not needed to restore a backup, but if you use the advanced passphrase feature you will need to back this up in memory and best to backup written down as well (paper or metal) . Passphrase should be kept separate than your backup 12/18/24 words

Bitcoin is inefficient as well (much less so than ethereum) but does solve a needed problem = censorship resistance in value transfer.  This same problem doesn't exist in running turing complete code however, as its  impossible to censor people running code.
The original marketing of ethereum was  "censorship resistance" and "unstoppable code" which turned out to be a lie ... if this is what you are referring to than what code does someone having a problem running on their computer or server? What exactly is the problem ethereum is  attempting to resolve?

They won't and can't because Bitcoin has lower acceptability and is too volatile. Agorism is not 100% or 0 , its the conscious action of counter economics where one attempts to limit their use of fiat in protest.

The fact that BTC is so little used for war and terrorism basically shows how dominant USD is and how liquid it is and how far BTC has to grow.


If a BTC tx is meant to buy drugs on the DNM or gamble illegally than its not an inefficiency in itself but accomplishing the task as intended so does not add to any extra "pollution" and could in fact reduce pollution.  I.E.. allowing someone to efficiently buy drugs online saves a lot of wasted time(every unnecessary moment in human time pollutes the environment indirectly) and fuel driving to a drug dealer , not to mention the horrible legal overhead and all the pollution that is created if the drug dealer or user gets caught.

That is exactly the problem . The principle design decisions of ethereum are absurd and pointless. Its like demanding to use a bubble sort algo and promising that future improvements to hardware will make it scale. Sure faster hardware will help , but why not use the right solution for the right task and be much more efficient from the get go. 
Ethereum is a fantasy castle built upon sand and filled with marketing word salad and false hopes. It is a stack of lies sold to the credulous, most of which aren't technically competent to understand. 
I could get into very technical details as to why most design decisions are absurd and pointless as well, but I'm sure you don't want to listen to them... Here is one example to ask yourself -

2) upgrade the firmware before setting up a wallet
3) Generate your own backup words and Do not store these digitally
4) Never write down the pin or passphrase together with the 12/18/24 words
5) At minimum secure the backup 12/18/24 words on paper in a sealed plastic bag to protect against moisture or flooding. Do not laminate as certain adhesives can damage the ink.
6) If you can afford , upgrade to a metal backup (steel , copper brass... but aluminum is unacceptable)
7) Keep backup private and secure , whoever gets a hold of this can steal your BTC!
8) Pin you will just store in memory as that is not needed to restore a backup, but if you use the advanced passphrase feature you will need to back this up in memory and best to backup written down as well (paper or metal) . Passphrase should be kept separate than your backup 12/18/24 words

Here is a breakdown of the power dynamics in bitcoin when it comes to the rules of the protocol.
Ultimately economic users hold the most value and determine the immediate outcome in a Hard fork split. 
**Miners** have invested a lot in infrastructure , but have tight margins and typically have electrical and rental contracts where they cannot afford to mine coins that are unprofitable for long due to the community rejecting it. 
**exchanges** Have a lot of influence upon the naming of tokens or at least their ticker and act as somewhat of a large investor. This is another reason among many that we advise you to store your BTC yourself because we want users to be in control and not large centralized exchanges. They can also help predict an outcome of a split with future trading pairs. 
**Merchants and payment processors** give legitimacy to a chain , increase its network effect and influence more users to use that chain in the long term
**Developers, specialists and Oracles**  They cannot force code upon the users and since nodes don't self update economic users can reject their proposals with as little as inaction. These people indirectly influence economic users indirectly because the whole ecosystem depends upon them for security fixes and updates. Many developers are extremely large stakeholders due to being involved in Bitcoin since 2010 and 2011. 
**economic Users** have the most control. Ones that validate the rules with a full node cannot be coerced into new rules even with 100% of hashpower deciding upon something. Since miners have such high overhead they will typically quickly follow the lead of these users because they buy their product and it is quite costly to ignore their wishes. 
Not all economic users are equal however and there are different types of economic users. 
1) **Spenders** tend to use bitcoin for its utility and buy it just to spend instead of long term investment. These cannot influence HF split outcomes much because they typically do not have many BTC at any given time thus aren't awarded many BTC split tokens to wield their influence with
2) **Hodlers / Investors** These individuals have a great power and there are approximately ~70 large whales in our ecosystem who have between 10,000 and 100k BTC . Since they are given both sides of the coin in HF they can quickly determine the outcome in a speculation war . These people tend to be conservative IMHO with scaling as they have greatly profited from the years of stability and have a lot to risk by any proposal that damages bitcoins key characteristics or security. With every passing year the amount of large whales will drop and BTC will become more evenly distributed.
In reality we want bitcoiners to be both spenders and investors and there is a spectrum in the two above with how much one fits in each category

**Best wallets for securing small amounts of BTC**
**electrum** For Desktop and Android
Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control 
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets, make sure you only upgrade from official sources like play store or  as malicious servers or adverts can tell you to upgrade malware from other sites
**Éclair** LN wallet for Android and desktop
Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees
Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental ,Some users may want to use other LN wallets. 
**hodlwallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Much better UX than other wallets and slick look as it’s a fork of the original Bread wallet
Cons- lacks some privacy features found in electrum 
**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration, RBF, HW wallet support and advanced 2fa options
Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers.

Most everyday BTC txs will occur on other layers. With sending BTC in a lightning wallet fees are  0 to a fraction of a penny and will remain low. This is far better than  3% and up + chargebacks


You are right that Bitcoin has much different security assumptions than  fiat or registered value. I would suggest that Bitcoin is more secure from the ground up and you can always add human security like ccs if  you want a different type of security with BTC but not the other way around, fiat will never have the security Bitcoin provides

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.** 
This rule applies with or without splits occurring.

It is counter intuitive but true as long as hashrate isn't constantly increasing faster than expected retarget(which it normally is thus if you have 8-9 min avg blocks the answer would be around 18 minutes)
The key here is to pay attention to the wording and notice that it is picking a random point in time and looking for the difference between when blocks are found. 
Due to the Poisson Distribution curve in mining-
Some blocks take 30 minutes to be found , and others can take an hour ... thus the average is really much higher than 10 minutes and represents a perfect example of the hitchhiker’s paradox. You may say that blocks can be found quicker than 10 minutes too , and while this is true , the poisson curve has a much longer tail on one side than the other because blocks cannot be found quicker than a little more than 0 seconds

Privacy will be a natural consequence of people choosing wallets that have low fees and instant confirmations. People won't use lightning wallets for privacy but they will get it. 
As far as onchain is concerned , Schnorr/MAST incentives most wallets to coinjoin because coinjoin txs become cheaper than regular onchain transactions . Users won't pick these wallets because they are private for the most part but will get this as an added benefit. 
Taproot allows privacy txs to share the same anonymity set as regular onchain transactions thus eliminates the concerns with everyone forced to opt into a privacy Bitcoin wallet to have a larger anonymity set.

My  comment has nothing to do with their recent hard fork.
The difficulty bomb and Ice age was intended to force the project regardless of any decisions from the ethereum foundation or developers to transition over to PoS by a set time. 
It was deliberately sold to investors(remember the massive 72 million premine sold off as a security ICO and by the eth foundation?) this way as a guarantee that they would transition over to PoS quickly. As we can see with the constant delays which deliberately undermine the whole purpose of the difficulty bomb and Ice age in the first place this is another example in a long list of lies sold to investors.

I'm an Agorist and support the general idea of seasteading but sometimes my fellow Anarchist and libertarian friends can be very naive when it comes to the state. Ethics and the Law do not matter much due to how byzantine and contradictory regulations can be. We have seen time and time again if you upset the powers that be than the violence of the state will seek vengeance, especially if you are smart, ambitious, and charismatic.  
Bitcoin inherently recognizes it must exist in a hostile environment in spite of well armed adversaries, thus all of the proof of work. Why can't seasteaders also recognize that their sovereignty will not be respected unless they also can defend themselves from militaries ? The laws and regulations regarding international waters is moot, as states will always drum up some alternative reason to attack your community or even fabricate one. 
This means the first step in seasteading is owning a well armed battleship so you can at least defend against pirates, let alone a country like Thailand.

People think that Block Chains are magical panaceas to every problem. Block chains are deliberately inefficient and with very narrow use cases in order to secure the network where strangers who don't trust each other can come to consensus.
Blocks without Proof of Work tend to all be scams because the whole point in adding latency to transactions and batching them within blocks is specifically to insure enough work in a verified manner is done before allowing unknown/decentralized miners to include the transactions within a block.
This inefficiency, which exists with or without proof of work, exists to allow uncensored transactions and trusting value from strangers. 
Ethereum was pitched as "fuel" for immutable and uncensorable transactions. We both know this is nonsense after the DAO hack and whats worse is there is absolutely no need to execute code in the first place in such an unscalable and insecure manner when there is no risk for censorship in code execution. 
No programmer or company has any problem executing "turing complete" code on their home computer or server. Also there is no foreseeable means of censoring code as any knowledgeable programmer will tell you even if the CPU kernal is completely in control by an attacker or regulators.  
Almost every single design decision from ethereum creators were done for marketing reasons and is insecure, inefficient and ultimately pointless. It is worse than a supererogation, but represents a Rube-Goldberg machine to impress the non technical credulous.

1) There are 50+ clones of Bitcoin trying to scam new users with brand confusion , 44 examples here - 
2) One of them is BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) that forked off from Bcash which was created by Craig Wright(faketoshi) who is a proven scammer and fraud -  , that has managed to fool people like Gavin Andresen , Roger Ver, and many others. The more technical and proficient developers quickly identified CSW was a fraud however.
3) Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright are threatening to sue everyone who educates others that CSW is a fraud in hopes that they can censor education by threats of litigation.
4) Binance and Kraken and other exchanges under popular demand will delist BSV as punishment for this unethical behavior

In 2017 tx fees for a month did indeed become too high due to a combination of a high price, spam attack, and just heavy use. I remember paying fees between 1-8 usd for a transaction personally and these were for low priority txs. 
Here is why transaction fees are now very low now and **what has changed since than**--
1) most services and wallets did not implement segwit in 2017 which changed the block capacity from 1MB of txs to 4 million units of weight. 
20 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max, or basically doubling the tx capacity 
Now most wallets and services have upgraded to this capacity and even to this day not all of its being used leaving room to grow.
2) Lightning was not on mainent that allows people to transact with instant transactions , network capacity of millions of transactions per second, and fees at a fraction of a penny. Now many stores accept lightning transactions and many wallets support it. 
3) Many businesses weren't batching in 2017 and now more are .
53.76 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max for maximum batching in a block for onchain 
4) Sidechains like RSK and liquid were not in use in 2017 , and now are 
Going Forward -
Schnorr sigs and MAST will be soft forked in increasing scalability and onchain capacity. 
Future hardforks are still planned to dynamically increase the blocksize as discussed here-

Most late adopters were buying in the run up from 2k to 20 k so bought in multiple times on the way up at different price points. Like previous bubbles the peak was fleeting and BTc remained above 19k for ~1 day ... very few people bought in at that level and if they did it is unlikely they only bought in during that single day and more likely they DCA multiple days. 
People unlucky enough to buy at the 2013 bubble peak of almost 1200 usd are now up over 6x on their return for 6 years ago which is an incredible return. With a stock portfolio one hopes for a mere 9.8% a year average

Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
	
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading 
Day traders find that they become obsessed with checking the price and end up spending most of their productive time looking at charts instead of working for a salary.
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying
For most people the only advantage they have is patience and long time preference over those that are greedy and impatient.
For day traders this is the general order of who has the most control and therefore an unfair advantage over you (or why you will likely lose money)
1)	Creator(s) who developed the coin with a massive premine or instamine. This does not apply to Bitcoin because Bitcoin is 100% PoW and has way too many developers with no one in control but does apply to most altcoins. They directly make changes or can leave the project for others so have inside knowledge and can manipulate the market. Their massive premine/instamine can also allow them to easily pump and dump the market like a mega-whale.
2) Exchanges and employees of an exchange get more market information than any trader, often manipulate the market to profit off of others in many ways, insider trade, and are often massive whales themselves because many altcoins bribe them with a massive premine to get listed.
3) Whales or Very large investors - have an advantage because they are more capable of creating bear or bull traps with coordinated fake media campaigns
4) Oracles , boiler room trading advisers - These are the classic pump groups that you find on telegram and elsewhere where they will get a large group of investors to buy in on something while they make trades against them at the last moment. The investor see's the coin blowing up so think the advice given was right and than the coin crashes in value and they are left holding the bag and blaming themselves because they think they didn't get out soon enough when the cards were stacked against them from the very beginning
5) Professional day traders who spend 50-60 hours a week trading and researching. These people have a slight advantage over the typical trader because they know more due to their efforts.
6) Amateur day trader (or you) with the least amount of information of the group and all the disadvantageous
Of course you can make a profit with luck but the odds are stacked against you and its more akin to gambling in a casino where the longer your play, the more likely you are to lose money.
Unless you decide to invest the effort in becoming a professional the Best advice is not to play, and use the single advantage that you do have - long time preference and patience over those that are greedy and impatient.
When investing in Bitcoin you should always wait at least 2-4 years before taking a profit of wait till the top of the next bull run where you have at least realized a 10x gain.
No one can predict the longterm or short term price. All we can say is this is the early adoption phase of bitcoin and some very exciting things are happening in bitcoin this month and next year to make bitcoin far more mainstream.
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 1-3 months fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both . 
Think long term. IMHO Try an accumulate as much as you can before 2020 to 2024.

Nope. 9.8% compounded yearly puts gold to shame. Do the math. At most you can say that gold is a good store of value compared to fiat, but this is a very low standard as an investment


Bullets are a much better currency than gold in these circumstances. Gold is merely a burden to carry and secure with little utility under such conditions.

Sending and receiving Bitcoin with lightning wallet is extremely private. 
BTCpay server changes the receive address with each transaction to insure privacy and accepting lightning txs. 
If you need to wash Bitcoin  with onchain transactions that you have already tainted than it is simple to do with coinjoin tools -
 for small amounts use samourai -
for larger amounts of 0.1BTc and more use wasabi -
You do not need to do this is you bought BTC without ID. You just need to do this if you are not making a lightning transaction (onchain only) , need good privacy, and bought the BTC with an ID.
Buying with one of the methods privately or receiving bitcoin with a lightning wallet needs no coinjoin -

Onchain or on other layers?
**Maximum capacity** onchain today assuming 10 minute block averages=
32,256 transactions per block
4,644,864 transactions per day
53.76 TPS (transactions per second)
math and further explanation
Maximum capacity on other layers = millions of TPS 


Currently we are not even using the alloted network capacity onchain and have plenty of free capacity on other layers as well. 
Next expected capacity increases will come onchain from Schnorr/MAST and offchain from developments in lightning/eltoo/statechains

Some banks already having to hold bitcoin to deal with ransomware alone. In the future banks more banks will likely invest in Bitcoin as an ongoing trend but banks are not going away either. Banks serve many different functions and registered value is different than bearer assets with different security assumptions and tradeoffs. 
State governments will likely have to eventually at least partially hedge their reserve assets in bitcoin as well if not completely but this is a long way out. 
The transition we are likely to see which is already occurring is consolidation in the banking industry where more local branches are closed down and a few big tech banks, square/cash app, venmo, paypal, facebook, and new ones like coinbase will take a large market share away from traditional banks and have much less physical overhead. Many of these tech companies that will replace a significant marketshare of traditional banks are already involved with Bitcoin as well
Here are the studies that further support this trend-
@_date: 2019-10-31 13:49:42
This switch will happen automatically when Bitcoin becomes a more stable unit of account for a period of time than the national fiat by reducing volatility.  We hope that simply a very large market cap and more liquidity will accomplish this which is thus far looking to be the trend as volatility slowly decreases. 
Merchants and businesses that issue loans will always tend to prefer a more stable unit of account to denominate their goods and services in.

 Mining rewards are comprised of inflation + tx fees, but we still have sometime before disinflation drops to such a level that miners are mostly dependent on tx fees.
 If Bitcoin is unpopular it will have lower security than it being popular, This is a while off however when you do the math so we could speculate what happens 20  years from now but the idea is  that enough sub penny L2 fees will pay for the larger onchain fees in due time

~~Their intentions are not deception~~ but simply allocating the right exposure for a risky asset. It is a good idea to expose yourself to uncorrelated asset classes. They should be more clear about is disclosing the total expected returns per year of 1000% and 10,000% over 10 years , as we had to extrapolate that so there is a bit of a white lie in what they are promoting. They are not assuming conservative returns for BTC. 
BTC falling to 0 in 10 years is completely unrealistic due to the lindy effect and the fact that we see extremely old altcoins that are outright scams still trade for value. At most one could say BTC is risky and can drop dramatically in value but 0 while possible, unrealistic. 
I would say Bitcoin has the risk profile of a risky individual stock investment , but not as risky as a penny stock. Most altcoins are riskier than penny stocks.

You should come to my country because we have no military since we abolished it in 1948
There is a bit of a lie here though because when Nicaragua invaded our country years ago due to a google maps bug we chased them out with our special police... which is akin to to the DEA or SWAT team in the USA in power 


It is a bit more complicated than this because that 23% in defense spending goes towards foreign aid, healthcare for vets, and protecting many other countries. 
So a country like mine and many others are protected by the USA military. You cannot so easily reduce spending because of obligations to old vets and thee negative externalities that has on cutting them off, and the political impact the US has on being the welfare donator to the whole world(while it manipulates and takes as well). Also keep in mind that budget is used for a lot of pure science and research that the whole world benefits from and many private corporations do as well. There are all sorts of externalities and consequences. 
I am all for reducing the centralization of power and size of the USA military as well, but don't assume that in doing so this will only benefit the average US citizen in the middle class either as many of them directly and indirectly benefit from the military.
An apt analogy would be akin to understanding that one can only protect ones wealth and resources if one is willing to spend an equal amount to secure it , much akin to the high cost of PoW with Bitcoin. Thus further reducing the military is fine , but it will open the door in for another superpower to take its place and all of the responsibility , liabilities, and benefits that come with such

12195/600 = 20 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max, thus my 14 TPS is very conservative average

Of course you know as well as I do Blocks are often found quicker than 10 minutes so these TPS numbers are variable and sometimes it will be higher than this. Also this doesn't include tx throughput on other layers which allows for millions of TPS.
Are you suggesting the math is wrong and we can currently tx over 54 TPS onchain with batching?

There are at least 55 countries out there with worse income inequality than the USA which is impressive because the USA has the most amount of billionares in the world by far (609 of 2153) thus one would expect the USA to have one the greatest income disparities due to this fact alone and they don't.

Costa Rica has very different politics than the USA and many political parties.(there are even 4 of the 57 legislative seats held by the libertarian party) In certain aspects it is free-er(personal growth and consumption of marijuana is legal, certain drugs legal, prostitution legal, ect..) than the USA , in certain aspects it is less free. 
Costa Rica was the last country to sign CAFTA in 2009 , which forced them to finally allow competition in for electricity and  telecommunications, but banking is still extremely regulated by the government. Before 2009 all electricity , Internet, and phone service was handled by 1 government department called ICE. 
All banks have a local Costa Rican S.A. (corporation) and the ones that aren't specific to Costa Rica like BCR, BanoNational, ect... pay for the international banks brand. If you have a citi or scotia bank account elsewhere like in the USA , your debit card will charge you two 5 usd fees(like you transacting with a diff bank) even if you visit the same bank in our country because they technically are separate banks legally .
Paypal was just allowed to come into costa rica a few years ago and with the international tx fees you will get hit over 8% as not to compete with local bank cc processing which is around 5.5% + extra fees so 7-8%
So technically speaking a S.A..(sociedad anonima) is a private corporation, but the banks are so heavily regulated here and cannot be independently controlled that they may as well be considered part of the government

That is an intrinsic difference between bearer assets and registered value. So physical cash , gold, paintings, Bitcoin all have different security assumptions and benefits and tradeoffs with digital fiat ownership or stock ownership
One way to thwart that concern like I do is use multisig where most of the keys are offsite and difficult to get to so even if I was kidnapped and tortured I would not even be able to facilitate this crime even if I wanted to. Or you can lock the BTC with CLTV

You are asking a complex question which doesn't have simple solutions. Socialism leads to much larger problems like we have seen in Cuba and Venezuela in regards to wealth inequality. 
More individual capitalism and empowerment and less crony capitalism and a realistic realization that wealth inequality will always exist and should always exist (although IMHO is a bit too high now)
This can be done by the state trying to empower the individual and small business owner. The specific solutions to this are many as there is no panacea or magic bullet  so I will give one example to address global warming and wealth inequality - 
Give further tax incentives for wind, hydro, solar power for individual consumers. This has another side effect of increasing energy independence. modernize the electric grid and pass regulation forcing public electric companies to buy back green energy created from homes and businesses into the grid. (In the USA some jurisdictions allow this , others do not). 
What this can do is empower individuals to not be dependent upon  the resources of the state and corporations and actually get a check for any excess green energy produced raising a families income. 
Another solution is Bitcoin , because it removes the power of the state, banks, and insiders to tax the poor and middle class with inflation and create perverse incentives where people are incentivized to take on debt rather than save.

Last year with the introduction of LN. LN txs are a type of BTC tx and you can make 1/1000 of a sat txs. 


That is preferred as its another tax , no evidence it needs to be. IMHO slight deflation would be better due to incentives promoting savings and angel/VC investing instead of people becoming debt slaves. 


And we see the damage it has done. 


I disagree, frivolous spending has all sorts of negative externalities. Regardless Bitcoin has proven spending increases with rapid deflation. I prefer slight deflation which is the target we are aiming for when liquidity grows


There are many schools of economics from MMT, Keynesian, Austrian, ect... and nuances within all of them. Bitcoin is advancing our understanding of economics. 


They do when they need to , and that is the way they should spend as it reduces waste and increases wiser buying decisions. 


Fiat will not be replaced anytime soon, if ever, as registered value is very different that bearer assets. Bitcoin will likely keep eating away at market share from fiat though. 


But people spend and give more during rapid deflation undermining this concern

This is exciting for 3 reasons :
1) Even intels latest processors are still at 14nm , and they are delaying switching to 10nm reflecting how advanced the Bitcoin ASIC industry is 
2) Moore's cliff is fast approaching which means further improvements beyond 5nm will be slow which means we are starting to see the transition to commoditization of ASIC  equipment where the equipment doesn't immediately become obsolete and prices will eventually start to drop. 
3) Canaan is a solid ASIC company with Bitcoin interest aligned and this further reflects how missteps from other ASIC manufacturers like Bitmain that aren't 100% committed to Bitcoin are punished by the market

As long as the intolerant minority like us exist they will be far less likely to take away our rights of free expression with Bitcoin.
One of the great things about Bitcoin is it allows us to more peacefully prevent theft, where the state in many circumstances would have to torture or threaten torture and death among loved ones to possibly find cooperation, and at this stage I don't think many agents are psychopathic enough to carry out such actions to steal some bitcoins.
Potential enforcement may include jailtime where upon release you Bitcoins are much more valuable, and now the state has a very wealthy enemy.

With regards to ethereum -
Ethereum is a premined scam.
1)	Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense  to the credulous. 
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine ignoring the 60 million they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus.
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) Advertising immutability and unstoppable contracts that were than immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. 
6)	For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.
Additionally, there are plenty of ICO's who have locked up Ethereum's and need to constantly sell them for fiat to pay for their burn rate going into next year which places a constant negative pressure on ETH price

Ethereum is a bigger scam than Bcash. Exchanges profit greatly off of scams.  Petitioning them to remove them is pointless. We should vote with our dollars , like me buying BTC with cash app. 


Amateurs who don't understand Bitcoin believe this propaganda. Satoshi created the first payment channel proposals, created the first variations of RBF, and the whitepaper is clear on what defines Bitcoin(most worked valid chain and BTC has both the most cumulative work and its nodes are backwards compatible with earlier consensus rules unlike bcash ). BTC also is far more cash like than BCH with lightning. Bcash checkpoints and centralization also make BCH less "peer to peer"  


Faith is not needed, bitcoin is growing through some growing pains and needs a lot more work , especially on UX... but our focus should be on improving Bitcoin and not supporting scammy projects.

Most maximalists correctly believe Ethereum is a scam (This doesn't mean all altcoins are scams) and have very good reasons to believe so:
The Ethereum ethos is contrary to much of the Maximalists ethos as well. 
I apologize if this is offensive to ethereum investors but part of what defines many maximalists is their terse honesty.
Many of us tend to be very skeptical of "smart contracts" and "Dapps" and for good technical reasons, but are open to the eventual utility in efforts that have some hope for secure and efficient smart contracts. Such as with non turing complete scripting creating more complicated smart contracts(smart contracts already exist within BTC) - One example - 
This doesn't mean that maximalists will never test or study other altcoins, we often do, as sometimes there is something to learn but mostly they are discarded ideas from Bitcoin or temporary memes so finding useful information or code we can roll into Bitcoin is not common.

opening a lightning channel doesn't need have a priority as it is done way before I need to buy something so I always pay 1-4 sats per byte onchain, than this fee of 2-10 cents USD is amortized across many lightning txs making the fee per tx less than 1 penny each. Keep in mind when I say 1 to a few sats on lightning I am not referring to sats per byte but sats total or a small fraction of 1 US penny. fee is 0 if you have a channel open directly with merchant.
Use native bech32 segwit with RBF and manually fee input for best results in onchain txs
If you check the mempool 1 sat per byte txs have no problem confirming  even today onchain
Credit cards cost merchants 2.9% to 8% and that is not including all the other fees like chargebacks and more. Consumers have to pay these fees indirectly with higher prices!

Otherwise here is what "experts" typically want in a roadmap if you must - 
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:20:44
IMHO, this would be an ideal process--
1) Consensus is found within developers to first address any valid concerns . Bitcoin ultimately is a software project so this is the starting point. 
2) Once devs have consensus they should solicit the wider community of businesses , miners, exchanges for any input, objections, or concerns 
3) Once a rough consensus is found here they should release the code for testing as an RC, than final version to be slowly adopted by nodes and miners 
4) activation code should generally follow BIP 8 
Where soft fork (not hard fork as that requires much stronger levels of consensus) lock in for new upgrades can occur fairly quickly once 95% of hashrate within a set window activates the soft fork 
Otherwise a ~6 month delay occurs before a lower threshold of 80% of hashrate can activate the soft fork
If this is not met another ~6 month delay (total 1 year) before a flag upgrade UASF of all upgraded nodes occurs where the uncooperative miners either decide to go their own way or comply with users wants like we saw before with UASF148/segwit2x

The gist of the argument is that golds industrial "intrinsic" value is dropping already and its value can rapidly degrade just as the price per oz of Aluminum,salt,purple dyes did. 
Its usefulness is going to fall back on jewelry and a store of value for gold bugs, but even there many younger generations aren't really into precious metals like previous generations are. I could see a slow transition as we already are witnessing of Bitcoin becoming a better SoV and reserve hedge than gold.
It will always have certain small value because its a useful element, but I could see a scenario where those gold vaults are slowly sold off and dumped on the market.

Bitcoin will not replace Fiat. Registered Value and Bearer Assets exist as very different assets. Countries will also not give up fiat so soon either. 
The best we can hope for is massive adoption where Bitcoin unseats the USD as the number 1 reserve currency/asset with higher liquidity and more stability than the USD. Thus we will see something like Bitcoin , USD fiat, EURO, Yuan in that order for reserve capitalization status.
Bitcoin also will help keep good fiat currencies more honest due to competition. Stable forms of Fiat currencies are unlikely to stop having a target or being slightly inflationary(try and get politicians to spend less, I dare you!) so Bitcoin doesn't have much of a concern that they will compete as a disinflationary currency.

Beautiful wallet UX. Downloading to test now
Thus far , I notice one issue that is a security concern. Desktop Wallets should not have the BIP39 password in plaintext as that encourages copy and pasting it digitally which is dangerous. People need to manually write down these words physically and not store them digitally.

1) Basically if you are setting the fee yourself that is the amount you will pay but your tx will get confirmed much faster than the same fee coming from a non segwit tx . 
SegWit-P2SH addresses start with a 3
SegWit-Bech32 addresses start with bc1
2) here is a useful tool to estimate fees in segwit 
As you can see you want to pay around 84 sats a byte right now or more due to VBK shitcoin spamming BTC. If you payed 84 sats a byte from a non segwit address than it would take much longer than the fee scraper indicates
3) Make sure you use a wallet that uses RBF (Replace by fee) so you can easily bump the fee if need be. Examples are Bitcoin core, electrum, blockstream green, Samourai

We have plenty of time to discuss the best proposals , properly test , and get consensus. 
It is first critical we gather enough data about 4MB of weight increase we had in 2017 and how the fee market works before deciding. 
Here is some existing research and code with proposals - 
IMHO , it should first be designed as a sidechain/drivechain or extension block for maximum backwards compatibility. Might be nice to include Lamport signatures for future proofing quantum resistance and other hardfork wish list items -  Better yet , design where Lamport signatures could quickly be added as necessary with a soft fork later because efficienct quantum computers might never be a concern.   If there is a critical bug onchain we could always do an emergency hardfork with the prepared and tested sidechain/extension block upgrade earlier .

Other advice - 
1) Store your BTC in either a SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees or beetter yet native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~39-58% in fees

28% health care

Sure, and they are barely spending at all during bear markets , but are more likely to accumulate or just sit on their savings. If you have been paying attention over the last 10 years you would have seen this over and over again through the market cycles. 


Some are , other are spending over 50% of their BTC savings, as I have had some friends make large purchases over the years. 


Also the previous bubbles like the Two in 2013


So now your claim is that only in very modest deflation do people spend less instead of rapid deflation? The reality is people spend when they need to and its akin to buying a cell phone or laptop ... Sure you can wait 6 months and get the latest better model or buy the out of date model for a significant discount , but most people will spend now because they need the products now. People aren't going to stop spending on things they need, and it is highly improbable that a slight 2% inflation causes people to run out and spend their fiat either.

lightning is designed to avoid hubs. Research into "autopilot"


Lightning nodes have nothing directly to do with mining bitcoin so the question doesn't make much sense. Thus I'll answer the first part, if large node suddenly disappeared forcing all channels to do a force close than that BTC would be held up for ~144 blocks before being available for onchain. it would not effect lightning much because people naturally have several channels open with different nodes and lightning is multihop. 


ok, so you are suggesting a large miner being also coincidentally a popular full node ? Got it. Yes the mempool would fill up quickly , creating higher fees , which other asics would quickly come online to cash in filling the hashrate void in such a scenario. 


lightning is designed to automatically route over even less popular nodes. Autopilot picks channels to insure that "hubs" don't get too popular

Proof of Stake is not new or very interesting, and exists as a form with fiat currency already.
Proof of stake has many more attack vectors(nothing at stake attacks, long range attacks, short range attacks , stake grinding attacks) than proof of work and ultimately is either less efficient or less secure.
Further reading -
There doesn't seem to be any foreseeable solutions to making proof of stake secure either besides obscuring the flaws. Bitcoin is deliberately made inefficient with proof of work as using provable work that is **external** to the blockchain is the only means to create real costs where the game theory supports a model where it is both profitable to secure BTC and extremely costly to attack it.
With PoW (proof of work) you would need a tremendous amount of effort in order to censor 1-2 blocks with building many asic mining farms, and than burning the electricity continuously in order to attack bitcoin.
With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before) to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff cartain attacks because it involves outside resources.
There are many different variations of proof of stake but the simplest way to understand this is by looking at those blockchain's as a democratic consensus mechanism where everyone's vote is weighted based upon how many coins or stake they control. Their staked coins than have an opportunity to create a block without proof of work and a dev controlling 51&amp; of the coins gets to virtually mint \~51&amp; on average of all the blocks . This presents another concern as the coins typically need to be in "hot wallets" to do so instead of cold storage leading to a more insecure environment.
Since most PoS coins tend to have massive premines where only a small number of devs control most of the coins this also presents another concern as those devs can be targeted by states , hackers, or attackers or as we often see with altcoin devs they pump and dump a project and than move onto a competing project to repeat this cycle over and over again thus have an incentive to attack their old project.
With Proof of work , seizing the coins or stake of any individual or group of people doesn't effect the process of mining or securing the network directly at all . They can only try and spook the market by dumping coins at a discount while individuals like myself will happily buy up all the discounted coins.
PoS is being sought because it is a clever marketing ploy to attract environmentalists and liberals in silicon valley who are concerned about the electricity used in PoW mining. They fail to see all the external costs in PoS.
It is akin to not adding up all the inefficiencies in coming to a consensus in a democratic presidential election.
Watch this video -
There is a fallacy and rests on a false assumption that **total amount** electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost of electricity burnt** will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

So now the narrative is Ethereum is supposed to be decentralized cash instead of fuel for running smart contracts? If so than it is designed completely wrong and fraudulently promoted. 


I don't see any technical need one needs to run "turing complete" code on a blockchain. You understand you can run the code off the blockchain right? Code can interact with p2p cash on a blockchain. Why would you want such an inefficient way to execute code with such a large attack surface specifically?


There aren't even any projected use cases that are viable. Technically it is as absurd as Vitalik's first scam he pitched with Quantum mining to credulous investors. Its nonsensical technobabble used to impress those who are not programmers. 
 &gt;And your argument that your node sets the 21M supply in stone. That is all well and good until the miners don't agree.
its always possible Bitcoin fails. Bitcoin is the only Blockchain that has gone up against this concern where most miners and largest companies tried and failed to make a change without consensus and failed. So it has already proved itself once and I am going to do my best to remain secure in the future.

The max size is 3.7MB as already tested long ago - 
The size of the block doesn't matter much in the context , what matters is the tx throughput, so here is the math if you are curious- (not including future improvements with MAST and schnorr)
4 bytes version
1 byte input count
36 bytes outpoint
1 byte scriptSigLen (0x00)
0 bytes scriptSig
4 bytes sequence
1 byte output count
8 bytes value
1 byte scriptPubKeyLen
22 bytes scriptPubKey (0x0014{20-byte keyhash})
4 bytes locktime






**12195/600 = 20 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max**, thus my 14 TPS is very conservative average
**32256/600 = 53.76 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max for maximum batching in a block**

Bitcoin is deliberately made inefficient with proof of work as using provable work that is external to the blockchain is the only means to create real costs where the game theory supports a model where it is both profitable to secure BTC and extremely costly to attack it.
With PoW (proof of work) you would need to be a tremendous amount of effort in order to censor 1-2 blocks with building many asic mining farms, and than burning the electricity continuously in order to attack bitcoin.
With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before) to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff such an attack because it involves outside resources.
There are many different variations of proof of stake but the simplest way to understand this is by looking at those blockchain's as a democratic consensus mechanism where everyone's vote is weighted based upon how many coins or stake they control. Their staked coins than have an opportunity to create a block without proof of work and a dev controlling 51% of the coins gets to virtually mint ~51% on average of all the blocks . This presents another concern as the coins typically need to be in "hot wallets" to do so instead of cold storage leading to a more insecure environment.
Since most PoS coins have massive premines where only a small number of devs control most of the coins this also presents another concern as those devs can be targeted by states , hackers, or attackers or as we often see with altcoin devs they pump and dump a project and than move onto a competing project to repeat this cycle over and over again thus have an incentive to attack their old project.
With Proof of work , seizing the coins or stake of any individual or group of people doesn't effect the process of mining or securing the network directly at all . They can only try and spook the market by dumping coins at a discount while individuals like myself will happily buy up all the discounted coins.
PoS is being sought because it is a clever marketing ploy to attract environmentalists who are concerned about the electricity used in PoW mining. They may have valid concerns that I also share but they fail to see all the external costs in PoS.
It is akin to not adding up all the inefficiencies in coming to a consensus in a democratic presidential election.
There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

**Bech32 (Addresses that start with BC1)**
Pros -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~36-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
Pros -
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
Cons -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32

100MB blocks are technically possible to do for a server in a data center. Those of us who cannot validate 8MB blocks will obviously oppose it for technical reasons. 
Perhaps you misunderstand what my argument is. I am not restricting you from Segwit2Mb or 8MB blocks . By all means, have 16MB blocks if it makes you happy. I will not run that software though and many others will not follow that fork... for technical reasons.
@_date: 2019-12-20 21:09:56
Running software that fully validates all the rules like - 
Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is ~255GB for an archival node
Pruned nodes can get down to around 5GB , and have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it (It actually prunes as it validates)
You are only truly p2p if you are running a full node . running light clients depend upon you trusting a middleman and typically only validate block headers. Light clients are exposed to many more threats full nodes are not. There are also privacy concerns with light clients that full nodes are secure against. The whitepaper only suggests SPV "light" nodes in the context of fraud alerts(proofs) existing but thus far none exist and therefore you shouldn't trust large amounts of btc with a light client.
The most secure , "active" wallet would be a hardware wallet integrated with a full node . One way to do this easily is to run your own electrum server     
  and than integrate electrum wallet with your HW wallet and connect to your electrum server. A new solution is Blockstream green which works with ledger , trezor one , and trezor model T 
There are close to 55k  full nodes on the bitcoin network .(Some sites show much lower numbers because they exclude most non listening full nodes. )
Here are all the rules that full nodes validate that light clients almost completely skip-
Thin client / Psuedo SPV weaknesses
This is not an exhaustive list and there are many more concerns than this -
1.	As we saw in 2017 year Garzik and segwit2x supporters were deliberately attempting to undermine pseudo-SPV nodes/light clients by imposing rule changes that users did not necessarily agree to or where even aware of . Full nodes were immune to this attack vector. light clients would simply follow the most worked chain even if they disagreed with these changes and would also lose out on their ability to claim both sides of the split thus also losing money. 
2.	light clients fail in privacy for many reasons . They are using a backend server to show you your wallet balances. This immediately links together all your wallet addresses to them. Bloom filtering SPV wallets like Bread wallet, AirBitz are however different, they don’t use a backend server, rather they are leaking information to every blockchain analysis company, who are crawling the Bitcoin network for their bloom filters. 
 
3.	Light clients fail to validate most of these security rules  and therefore must trust a middleman or third party and thus can essentially be manipulated by this company and a multisig of large miners unlike full nodes. This is no longer p2p cash by definition. If you are running a full node it doesn't matter if 100% of the miners try and subvert the rules you agree to , they cannot force you to accept blocks or changes you don't agree to . It is absolutely critical we enforce and respect the rights of individual bitcoin users.
4.	Various sybil attacks can be used in conjunction with lie by omission and say that a block isn't there when it actually is--a sort of denial of service attack.

No, a big reason those fork altcoin spinoffs lost so much money against Bitcoin is many maximalists split their coins, dumped the altcoin, and reinvested in Bitcoin to defend BTC. There are also some maximalists that I personally know that still have yet to split their altcoins UTXO airdrops and cash in, but this is simply because they don't want damage their privacy and security with their cold storage.

Gold will likely become less of a valuable asset much akin to salt, aluminum, purple dye and many more examples. This is due to newer materials having superior properties like carbon nanotubes being far better heat conductors and electrical conductors than gold. The other thing to consider is in the next 100 years asteroid mining will be very prevalent(could start happening in as soon as 20 years commercially) which would dramatically flood the market with gold making it far less scarce unlike Bitcoin

Great , a country should descend into ~~anarchy~~ chaos with reckless mismanagement and unjust wars. Bitcoin being a hedge against fiat keeps them more honest and corruption down. 
Also it would not happen overnight where a country immediately falls apart. They could start an unjust war, than slowly try and spend their way out of it with taxes being increasing more difficult to collect and than start to realize they cannot sustain an unjust war because inflation is getting out of hand as they overspend and overprint fiat which would likely end an unjust war prematurely.

IMHO the much larger problem with Bitcoin as a currency is lack of liquidity creating a poor unit of account due to volatility. Bitcoin is much less volatile and much more liquid than altcoins but compared to USD or Euro it is pathetic. The hope is Bitcoin will eventually become more stable with increased liquidity. 
Many maximalists tend not to be concerned with fees as much as Bitcoin and realistically any cryptocurrency(even Stephen Pair admits almost all txs are with Bitcoin) is still in a stage of being a speculative asset/investment or SoV(Store of Value) , rather than **primarily** a MoE (Medium of Exchange). Maximalists understand that Bitcoin can scale because most txs will occur on other layers and tx fees will remain very small on these other layers as they are today. 
The eventual goal is for Bitcoin to be an excellent SoV, MoE, and MoWT(medium of wealth transfer), but we have a lot of work to do, which is a big reason why we want to focus on Bitcoin and not be distracted.
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:05:08


Most of that illegal tx activity is intended and should not be illegal and why Bitcoin was created in the first place= regulatory arbitrage.


Unfortunately, Bitcoin isn't used much for the unethical funding like war, terrorism, and torture like fiat is. Bitcoin's principle illegal use is for more nuetral illegal activities that should not be illegal like gambling, drugs, capital flight, and, prostitution.

There are technical reasons for the 21 million limit , but economically it is arbitrary , but known and agreed upon which allows markets to price in value and have expectations. 
We do not have this with Gold.


The OP directly defines this comparison. It is relevant because if BTC were to supplant the role of gold as a reserve asset held by countries and banks(were most gold exists now) than it is a perfectly valid comparison to get an idea of the projected value of ones 1/21,000,000 of a network ownership would be. To be fair , it is unlikely that Bitcoin would ever replace gold in this capacity completely in our lifetimes(just take a certain % market share away), also gold is used outside this role as well, but than again Bitcoin has many other use cases too.

**Cloud Mining Contracts** Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees which mean you will never ROI. Cloud mining typically falls into 3 categories
**a)**	legit mining company that actually mines what you invest, but is misleading to clients the harsh reality of hashing difficulty increasing and fees = You will not profit and not make a ROI
**b)**	Cloudmining company that fractionally reserve mines to keep up appearances and prove they actually are doing some mining but in reality do not mine the hashrate that they are contractually obligated to = You will not profit and not make a ROI
**c)** Straight up ponzi scheme with no mining = You will not profit and not make a ROI
Mining is very competitive and if miners need to both pay for marketing, profit sharing , affiliate revenue, and management of many small clients or partners this overhead will quickly drive them out of business.
Keep in mind that BTC mining difficulty is typically increasing , which means the payouts are fine initially but than naturally get smaller and smaller as the months go on. So at first everything seems fine than you notice later you start to get less and less until there is no payout.
So people that cloud mine either come away from the experience bitter and don't return , or they make a profit , but not from mining but from the appreciation of Bitcoin during their contract. I.E... They invest 500 USD , cloud mining company pays back 300 USd of BTC over the next year , but because Bitcoin appreciated in value that BTC is now worth 800 dollars and the client is happy because they don't have the know how to compare what that investment would be worth if they simply sat on it and waited for their bitcoin to appreciate in value.

No, the very difficult math is being done right now with examples in zksnarks, taproot, graftroot, MAST, Schnorr sig aggregation, HTLCs, Simplicity, Musig , ect ... 
There exists many examples of developers currently working on Bitcoin with a far better understanding of cryptography and complex mathematics. 


Satoshi's code was average at best. Most core dev's are far more competent coders than Satoshi. 


Many developers also are well educated in economics and many other topics... this is what drew them to Bitcoin in the first place and not unique to Satoshi.
Satoshi was indeed Brilliant and a Polymath but the evidence reflects he was building upon the work of others like Wei Dai, Adam Back, and Nick Szabo and his writing , corresponding times reflects the likelihood of a single individual.(Understand that satoshi immediately started working with other devs and his bitcointalk persona matched his email correspondence , matched his code on sourceforge and his code is written in such a way that it reflects a single individual)

Much akin to file sharing , Bitcoin performs regulatory arbitrage by dramatically raising the costs for enforcement where it simply is not profitable to continue punishment as a means of deterrence. 
We have already seen this tested with the unethical arrest of the website owner Ross Ulbrict. It took years of effort from teams of agents between multiple departments in order to punish this man and steal his Bitcoin where the cost to enforce such action was much higher than the amount taken unlike with many DEA drug busts. The hope was to send a message and scare the market but Bitcoin was unaffected , and several DNM sprung up in their place, and we saw increased traffic in online illegal sales with BTC thereafter.
Enforcement Agencies cannot sustain the operational costs for controlling Bitcoin long term , it simply is not feasible. Unless these agencies can profit off of theft from Bitcoin directly(they cannot), they must depend upon taxpayers to shoulder the high cost to pay for enforcement for these "victim less" crimes. Any state that takes such draconian measures against Bitcoin is also signalling to their populace they live in a totalitarian society and this could actually spur capital flight as well. 
Enforcement agents also need to recognize that attempted theft of our BTC will be met with maximum levels of hostility as we are discussing them attempting to take away sovereign wealth outside of their creation and management. I would personally rather die than the succumb to the fate of theft, kidnapping, and torture that victims like Ross has been subjected to. To us, Bitcoin is akin to an inalienable right much akin to the first amendment, that cannot be stripped away. 
Good luck.

Keep in mind when I say 1 to a few sats on lightning I am not referring to sats per byte but sats total or a small fraction of 1 US penny. fee is 0 if you have a channel open directly with merchant. 
Use native bech32 segwit with RBF and manually fee input for best results in onchain txs

While this is technically true due to the nature of the fractional reserve system which creates more fiat with debt, the FED also has an inflation target so if more than expected amounts are created because of this debt than they will take steps to reduce inflation as well.

Agreed, but it still needs to compete with other fiat currencies and also compete with bitcoin. 


Yes, currencies fail all the time. USD had at least 3 past failures in its short history and this is ignoring all the private currency before central banking. (Confederate dollars, 100% Gold standard, Partially Asset backed all failed now we have fiat)  They just change and reboot them. 


I get what you are saying with fractional reserve banking deliberately designed to create fiat from debt but you are taking this principle too far. Too much debt and spending certainly does matter and can destroy an economy.


Cryptocurrencies have much bigger problems than this. The largest problem is lack of liquidity and thus a poor unit of account due to volatility. This is why they are more treated as speculative Assets 
at this time and it matters not if the UX was perfect in the software when the currency is volatile thus making a very poor UX IRL. 


Bitcoin has had rfid payment abilities for years now. Again, not Bitcoins biggest problem

Well yes, as far as Classic Devs are concerned , they are forking off of 0.11.2 , and Core is already on 0.12.0 RC 2 which is shortly going to be deployed in the ecosystem. In the unlikely event that Classic is adopted(Minimum  2 months from now) Core would have released 0.12.0 in the wild with many users and deploying a softfork of segwit in April. 
There are dependencies with all the features and upgrades, and they must be done **in succession**. If core were to follow your advice they would have to throw away thousands of man hours of labor and switch to classics 0.11.2 fork or conduct a second rushed HF of their own.  The likelihood of either happening is extremely small.
A far more likely scenario occurring during the Classic grace period is Core promising a HF of 2MB HF 6 months from now - 
3) Classic gets 75% and during the 28 day countdown Core devs commit to a future date for a 2Mb HF thus attracting enough miners to drop Classic support below 51% and prompting classic devs to warn user to patch their implementations so they don't HF with a minority amount of hashpower
I don't think anyone has to worry about this because many Chinese miners believe that 75% threshold is too small. f2pool wants 95% , and most other Chinese pools want 90% or higher.
Read for yourself their thoughts-

There is nothing set in stone , but they really do want to do a HF early 17' if they can complete all the other tasks. They have discussed this with Wang Chun in  on the 12th and 19th - 
 and recently re-affirmed their position here - 
Essentially, they are planning on a HF increase for either kicking the can or flex cap but cannot make promises on a specific date because there are known unknowns and probably unknown unknowns that could interfere with such a schedule.

Changing the block weight limit is certainly fine in the future if needed and if it finds consensus and part of the original scaling "roadmap"


incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls** based on allowing miners
to produce larger blocks at some cost. These proposals help preserve
the alignment of incentives between miners and general node operators,
and prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee
market behavior that will eventually fund security."
Keep in mind that Bitcoin is required to eventually hardfork regardless so we may as well include many wish list items including a permanent scaling option-

Commodity backed currency is a thing of the past and has shown to be deeply flawed time and time again. Gold bugs are also a dying breed and ussually over 50 years old.

exchanges typically require 6 confirmations for BTC and 12 confirmations for BCH. So about 2 hour before you can sell with BCH.  In reality due to BCH having 5% the SHA256 hashrate means  that exchanges are foolish and should require many more confirmations than BTC for the same degree of security as its very easy to reorg BCH now. 


This makes sense, since you aren't using BTC as p2p cash to buy things than you aren't using it with merchants who accept 0 confirmation onchain txs . Use a wallet that supports native segwit and look here for fee priority -  to help you in the future.

the most amount of tx will be achieved with segwit is a ~1.7MB block =12195/600 = 20 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max or 2256/600 = 53.76 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max for maximum batching in a block


no , its more akin to doubling the capacity if most txs are segwit. 20 TPS is the maximum but will not be typical because of different tx types. 14TPS is more realistic avg with mostly 95+% segwit. This will improve greatly with schnorr and mast though

There are no "hubs" , just some merchants like this long list  that have slightly more liquid nodes with more channels. 
Even if hubs were to be created(the way LN is designed this likely won't occur) than the hubs have no idea what the tx volume is simply because every LN node is onion routed where no node knows how many hops exist , where the ultimate destination is, how many hops before , or who sent the transaction.
Thus reliable stats cannot be gathered because LN was built with privacy in mind.

I keep seeing this lie being repeated by young and naive people in the USA... just tax the wealthy more , just tax the corporations more when all they have to do is see that their favorite countries heavily tax the poor and middle class in Scandinavia and entitlement programs are over extended and going to have a huge problem due to low childbirth rates.

Do not store your bitcoin on exchanges or webwallets
Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are familiar technically with bitcoin.  99 % of alts/ICOs are scams and it is best to understand the basics before investing.
Do not daytrade
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 
Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well 
Do not mine until you have done at least 100 hours of research

For clarification this is 400 million onchain total history, excluding batching , excluding offchain and other layers 
For those who are interesting in the exact numbers of **maximum** transactions possible per block here are the numbers-
The max size is 3.7MB as already tested long ago - 
The size of the block doesn't matter much in the context , what matters is the tx throughput, so here is the math if you are curious- (not including future improvements with MAST and schnorr)
4 bytes version
1 byte input count
36 bytes outpoint
1 byte scriptSigLen (0x00)
0 bytes scriptSig
4 bytes sequence
1 byte output count
8 bytes value
1 byte scriptPubKeyLen
22 bytes scriptPubKey (0x0014{20-byte keyhash})
4 bytes locktime






**12195/600 = 20 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max**, thus my 14 TPS is very conservative average
**32256/600 = 53.76 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max for maximum batching in a block**
Of course you know as well as I do Blocks are often found quicker than 10 minutes so these TPS numbers are variable and sometimes it will be higher than this. Also this doesn't include tx throughput on other layers which allows for millions of TPS.

Yes, this only suggests bitcoin will likely remain more volatile than stable forms of fiat for some time. The question is if the total liquidity is high enough and the amount of Bitcoin well distributed than the volatility could foreseeably be lower than any small fiat currency with a lower market cap. The idea is Bitcoin becoming the new world reserve currency in time and thus possibly becoming more stable than fiat


A disinflationary currency simply encourages saving and investing rather than taking on debt. A change I welcome. 


No , we tried a world were individuals had to trust many competing banks. We never tested a currency were one could easily trust the currency in a verifiable manner with code. 


Some improvements and some downsides from this change. this is not to suggest that we cannot keep improving either however. Code is going to eat central banks in time. This might not happen in my life but will eventually happen as it is an unavoidable future due to new technologies simply being more efficient.

Yes, slightly different UX. 
Native segwit should be default without opting in immediately for best ease of use because most users will not opt in thus slowing down the adoption of bech32. (ckicken- egg dilemma on them waiting)
Thus when you click on the receive page to generate a Bech32 address there should be a link below the QRcode that says something akin to "Problems? Try a Legacy segwit address instead." which when clicked generates a SegWit-P2SH instead. 
This is the best of all worlds where there is still pressure for native segwit to be adopted but you can still fall back on old standards. 
Companies like purse.io already do this and it works great.

Thank you for the explanation. What many people do not realize is that it is trivial to doublespend with or without RBF when dealing with 0 confirmation transactions. I suppose what you are concerned about is casual users being able to doublespend that aren't technical who need a GUI UX? This is a valid concern.
The real solution is adopting solutions like BTCpay that have lightning integration but I am also sympathetic to the fact that many users/merchants still are not ready for lightning. 
The issue is that we need to move to a world where all onchain transactions can use RBF and or CPFP because we are slowly moving to a situation where tx fees pay for more of block reward and the fee market will always be somewhat unpredictable.  
Couldn't the merchant simply ask for ID to be copied in the event of an RBF flag in the interim until users start using lightning to reduce fraud? IMHO, they should do this with or without RBF when dealing with larger txs in person with 0 conf. Most merchants ask for ID for credit cards anyways in person.

It wouldn't if the implementation included in it already, but since they didn't and decided to delay copying Core's work they are delaying in 2 ways - 
1) If classic never sees 75% they are delaying Segwit by causing an unnecessary distraction by politicizing an inferior option and distracting developers from the work at hand coding and testing instead of putting out fires and correcting misleading information 
2) If Classic reaches 75% , than it will delay segwit even further by pushing the integration of segwit as a Classic HF in a much later date than April (Remember classic will take at least 2 months from now at the earliest to be fork the chain ) and than there will be another several month delay before Classic creates another HF for segwit(Their devs prefer HF over softforks for some odd reason) so expect segwit to be implemented in Classic towards the end of 2016(remember that it will be 2 months min once they plan and deploy the code ) 
P.S... this also doesn't address all the other improvements that Classic will delay like libsecp256k1, because they aren't forking 0.12.0

Bitcoin is has no central group adjusting interest rates or the amount inflation... no, the developers do not do this either as the inflation rate was set from the start and developers would be hopeless to change it after the fact

BTC would lose ~25% a year most years if it wasn't for ~10 days a year of unexpected large gains like we say on april 1st. 
This means that one cannot easily time the moments when to get in and get out , and one should typically have an investment horizon of 2+ years before taking profits 
It is unlikely Bitcoin will appreciate past 1 million USD per BTC with mainstream adoption **first**, mainstream adoption will likely occur after a few billionaires invest 1% of their portfolio in Bitcoin as a hedge 
This can occur much faster than anyone anticipates , and may start this year with BAKKT or Fidelity
The last 23 % appreciation we recently saw came from around a mere 100 million USD in fiat coming in. This may seem like a lot of money but to a single billionare that could be less than 1% of their investment portfolio. There are 2,153 billionares in the world now

It is just a practical reality and the security differences between bearer assets like BTC and registered value like fiat. You cannot directly compare the two as there are different risk profiles. 


A more trusted exchange is safer than a less trusted exchange but still very risky as you can see from this very topic. We have also seen some of the best exchanges get "hacked" multiple times


This simply isn't the case. The problem above fits this profile and isn't as uncommon as you think.

Courts in the USA have already decided that pure proof of work coins cannot be securities. Ethereum on the other hand premined 72 million eth , and the devs sold a 60 million ICO , and than kept another 12 million themselves on top of that

This is a very complex topic with many nuances that are always changing so there doesn't exist a comprehensive report. What you do have is many specific studies like this old one -
That reflected 4MB blocks could exclude 80% of all nodes due to RAM limitations alone. Of course much has changed since than but some of the premises remain. 
There are already some valid concerns that even ~1.2MB blocks have caused some centralization concerns as we saw a drop off of between 150k-200k full nodes to a mere   100k full nodes 
When it comes to block weight/size here are the principle concerns - 
Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is ~220+GB for an archival node
Pruned nodes can get down to around ~5GB , and have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it (It actually prunes as it validates)
The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:
1)	Block propagation latency (causing centralization of mining)
2)	UTXO bloat (increases CPU and more RAM costs)
3)	Bandwidth costs 
4)	IBD (Initial Block Download ) Boostrapping new node costs 
5)	Blockchain storage (largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner)
Thus if you wanted to focus on another aspect like bandwidth than - 
8 MB full blocks would need with 8 peers- 
	
Down:	0.447 Mbps
Up:	3.132 Mbps
Some would suggest that tech like compact blocks or xthin mitigate these concerns, but unfortunately only work in situations of cooperative nodes and not certain attacks , which is precisely when you need to have a full node validate your transactions the most. There are also other concerns from being able to efficiently use a full node over TOR, satellite, and many other concerns. Keep in mind that most altcoins are barely used and have not adequately been tested with consistent sustained full blocks or any attack scenarios so are very poor examples.

Yes , you are agreeing with me that Indians and Chinese  have a predilection for PM's ... the market determines its true value thus the price is exactly what it is worth. In the west this is changing though, much less demand for PM's , even older men like me sold all our gold once we realized that it is obsolete and doesn't have a bright future. 
Gold is no longer needed as a hedge as we have Bitcoin
Gold is a horrible investment with horrible returns 
In a mad max scenario, I have no interest in gold but prefer bullets, food, medicine and a long list before any PM's


You need to read this book to find out why using 2 PM's as reserve assets did not work out and why silver had to be dumped-- 
Governments and banks can and do play speculation attacks on each other and if one is using a much less rare PM as a reserve asset they will lose such a speculation attack and destroy their economy

I agree that income disparity is growing in the USA and I think the gap will continue. The reason for this is because there are many more billionaires in the USA. Part of the reason for this is the USA has tax policies that are less regressive than many other countries allowing people to become millionaires and billionaires, they tax most of the world due to the dollarization and reserve status of the US dollar, and the other reasons include the USA allowing its corporations to prosper principally because they can enforce their jurisdiction upon the whole world. The last 2 aspects go back to my original point of why that 23% military spending is so important so they can impose their will on the world. 
IMHO , this trend will likely continue. I'm just a tico from costa rica , and we have far worse income disparity here but I am bullish on the US economy and bullish on the US dollar impart because the US economy and military are strong and them holding the reserve currency status isn't going away anytime soon. 
I expect more millionares and billionares in the USA , and Bitcoin will play a part of the reason for this trend to continue as well. From the way things look another reason is taxes will remain lower in the US encouraging more income mobility into the ultra wealthy because Trump is likely to win 2020. Exciting times ahead for those willing to invest and work hard.

Cons- UX suffers due to lack of Fiat value displayed
**Éclair** LN wallet for Android and desktop
Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees
Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental , Some users may want to use other LN wallets. 
**hodlwallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Much better UX than other wallets and slick look as it’s a fork of the original Bread wallet
Cons- lacks some privacy features found in electrum and samourai
**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet

Whether you buy one troy oz of gold, or 1 kg of gold your % ownership of all gold will be diluted while your % ownership of the  Bitcoin network will not. 
If you buy 1 btc = 1/21,000,000 of a network ownership

Good idea. If Coinbase/Bitpay don't get on-board and quickly start to expedite the development of payment channels (whether Impulse , LN , or others) they are going to be in a world of pain because Peter Todd is soliciting interest for someone to create a nice GUI for his double spend scripts(Which has nothing to do with RBF). The fact that Classic supporters don't see this as a problem and believe that ignoring the implementation of payment channels (Segwit fixing Malleability is crucial to progress in this arena) is fine by delaying segwit in favor of a 2MB HF is dangerously irresponsible and ironically places their supporting payment processors in jeopardy of losing everything. 
P.S... I think it would be wise if Coinbase/Bitpay fork the open source LN and implement their own variation of payment channels that is compatible with LN for more diversity in the codebase. In either case fixing malleability is crucial to payment channels working properly.

Some of the FUD surrounding lightning comes from a technical misunderstanding of the solutions widely discussed like this example- 
 
A big part of the problem is most people don't have the capability to understand these solutions and it is easier to simply believe the FUD from political propagandists than comprehend well thought out technical solutions to problems. It also takes much more time correcting lies and misinformation while con artists continue to Gish gallop propaganda to those not technically savvy enough.

Ok, so you are discussing securities(legal or illegal) and not company shares. 
Yes , illegal securities have mostly wrong incentives which promote scams and an exit and increase the risks for a project to fail. 
Legal securities do not need blockchains to register their ownership. What is the purpose of using a block chain with legal securities?


One big reason why so many ICOs used ETH instead of the bigger community of Bitcoin users to launch their token on is specifically because they needed a very large pool of credulous investors to scam from. ICO's launched on Bitcoin were more carefully scrutinized by "toxic" Bitcoin users (or skeptical technical people who can evaluate a projects claims and willing to call out scams)


The mining fee would be 0 with this as you would open a lightning channel with the game company or the software(if the game was a decentralized project)
What I am missing is why do you need to represent the sword as a colored coin in such a game on a blockchain? What purpose other than marketing "block chain" hype does this serve specifically?
If the game is controlled by a single company than the ownership of that sword is tracked by their servers, if its a decentralized game than you can peer this database between various nodes rather than use an external blockchain.

3) short term volatility makes BTC less of a unit of account

Do you also realize that topping up any existing channels even without eltoo require no direct onchain txs? A single onchain transaction can top up a million different unrelated nodes and channels. With splicing that single onchain tx can perform many different txs simultaneously as well in addition to this.

FYI, you are sending from a non segwit address so overpaying for your tx. I just spent a few pennies ad got a quick confirmation , you spent 71 cents because you are overpaying on fees.  Send from a segwit address. Time to update your wallet. 
**Bech32 (Addresses that start with BC1)**
Pros -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~36-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
Pros -
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
Cons -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

Sure, but rather than allowing Core to release SegWit in April they believe a 2MB HF kick the can approach is more important to focus on . They are literally delaying all the benefits of Segwit and 0.12.0 in order for 0.3MB more capacity. This is obscene. 
I'd have more respect for their position if they forked 0.12.0 (with of without RBF) and claimed that they would attempt to release the HF implementation after Segwit.

My decision to stay on the original chain has little to do with what the others decide to do for "political" reasons. If good evidence reflected that 8MB blocks could be safe and wouldn't centralize nodes and miners too much than I would be fine with the HF... as it stands right now I believe that 8 MB is far too large because the current evidence from research, the fact that I would be unable to run a full node , and the fact that tested fraud proofs don't exist if I'm forced to run a lite client only.
So yes, I will absolutely stay on the original chain and sell all my forked split coins as it stands right now. I would love for this not to be the case but I may as well use fiat if I need to trust third parties.

This simply reflects how insecure Bcash is. One must spend a similar amount of security to insure the amount in wealth is protected. Bcash has almost no usage and people don't and shouldn't trust it for large payments. This is why coinbase requires 12 confirmations with BCh instead of 6 with BTC (in reality they should require much more.)
0.7 BTC in security = 3,640 usd in security per block , thus you couldn't trust large transaction in Bitcoin unless you waited many confirmations

Most users will just choose the wallet they trust or are like for UI or feature sets. The wallet devs are the ones choosing to incorporate segwit or not. The users still have the choice to select a wallet that doesn't have segwit or use a earlier version of the wallets software. That is the beauty of a soft fork , all previous versions of wallet software are still compatible and work. (I understand that they will not see signatures like normal after 95% , but that detail will be transparent to users.)
The bottom line is that simply Increasing maxBlockSize allows for malicious users to spam the network(I understand the 4MB argument against segwit ... but that has been addressed in the FAQ and isn't a concern like some are alluding too.) and with segwit , users have the choice and the network is protected by incentivizes for users to Reduce UTXO and reduce blockchain bloat through pruning the signatures along with all the other benefits you ignored and pretended didn't exist.

Points of clarification. 
1) Yang isn't clear on how he wants to tax Bitcoin, just that he wants the federal government to standardize regulation which is very vague. 
2) Yang is clear that he wants to introduce a 10% VAT tax in addition to current taxes like state sales taxes on all goods and services to help pay for UBI
Thus the current people on welfare would not likely see any benefits but have a 10% added burden from VAT tax. 
3) Yang would not remove current welfare programs but **add UBI in addition to welfare programs** where the US citizens could choose between the 2 , but the inefficient burden of the government managing both would increase
4) It is questionable that UBI could be paid for because he makes all sorts of incorrect assumptions beyond the VAT tax bringing in 800 Billion of the 4 trillion needed from assumptions that GDP would dramatically grow with UBI, to assumptions that peoples health would dramatically improve

This doesn't pay for the proposed programs even with 100% tax on the top 1%(no way you would even be able to collect this but for the sake of argument lets assume this reality can exist). Not even close. 
Additionally, now you are talking about capitalism with large entitlement programs **paid by the poor and middle class primarily**... not socialism


Scandinavia is not socialist, their leaders have to constantly remind people from the USA this fact.
Scandinavia is more capitalistic than the USA in certain respects.
The US has much higher typical average corporate taxes (39.1%) than Denmark (24.5%) , Norway (27%) , and Sweden (22%). I find it hilarious how so many US citizens complain about the evil corporations and at the same time hold the ideal of these social democratic countries to such a high regard while they pay for their welfare programs by heavily taxing the poor and middle class and giving tax breaks to corporations.
Yes, I understand that the USA recently (into effect 2018) cut corporate tax rates but this narrative we are discussing goes back 20+ years where the USA typically has much higher corporate taxes.

Huh? So your suggesting is to avoid a split by forcing a split with a flag day HF? What percentage of the community in your opinion is it fine to leave behind with HFs?
edit to reply to your post (Reddit doesnt allow me to right now)
You likely are already aware , but there are different opinions when it comes to HF's generally broken down as follows- 
1) ~ 50-100 btc users who don't want any changes at all.  and  They run patched versions of 0.5.4 and while very low numbers are old bitcoin investors some of which have large investments
2) ? Perhaps 1% of users who never want a HF unless it is absolutely critical bug fix (I.E... similar to 2013 crisis) 
3) A much larger amount of bitcoin users, larger than 5% IMHO who do not want political HF but only HF that are the best option and technically make sense. 
Some devs like Luke-JR believe that HF can only be "successful"(Meaning 2-3 coins don't exist after the event) if 100% of the community agrees. I don't personally know if this is true and think that perhaps if 99% of the community agrees on a HF and almost  100% of exchanges agree than a HF could be successful without 2 or more coins surviving. 
Personally, I believe that your proposal would likely get less than 75% community support, but thanks for clarifying your position with the fact that you are fine leaving 5% of the community on the original chain.

@_date: 2019-04-28 19:46:07
Burn addresses + miner mistakes or genesis block represents proof of loss where we know those UTXOs are unspendable.
Many old coins that have never been moved during 2009 to 2011 are likely lost. Many of us know this because we were the ones losing them back than when Bitcoin wasn't worth much.
It would take an incredible degree of fortitude to not move BTC mined from 2010 during the last 9 years to claim the UTXO altcoin airdrops, secure in a better wallet for security, or simply spend. Thus it is a very safe assumption to assume that many of these coins that have never moved will likely never move. 
In the early days when Bitcoin didn't have any value it was very common for people to download the "Bitcoin" wallet which would automatically start mining on their CPU and than they would delete it later without even making a backup. There are other incidents of our hard drives failing as well. Less care was taken to secure BTC back than because it wasn't worth much.

More info for you-
100% segwit = maximum 32,252 outputs per block right now without schnorr sig aggregation or MAST or future onchain capacity increasing (yes this will happen)
With splicing, one can open channel, close channel, and send Bitcoin outputs on-chain in a single transaction.
Eltoo allows users create channels and send txs **offchain** and integrates nicely with LN and onchain-  . This means that eltoo has a slightly different trust model than sidechains like liquid and Lightning channels with penalties but suitable for most use cases.

Altcoins like Bcash have many proponents who have to lie to others to promote their coin and shill their bags. Here is one example of an often repeated you will see all the time - 
By all means Bitcoin should compete with altcoins and people should be free to choose their preferred blockchain or fork Bitcoin as they want as its open source. What we oppose is lies to confuse new users.


Every full node in Bitcoin contains a local mempool -
 
This is a temporary memory cache where transactions are stored until they are included in blocks as you can see here 
When you send a transaction in Bitcoin it instantly shows up in a wallet because of this mempool and than later gets confirmed by the miners . Full nodes(even non mining) will reject invalid transactions even before a confirmation

It still is the same where the BTC and fiat are shown at the end. Seems a bit dangerous to price things in Bitcoin as that means the price of items can swing 80% in value , or 25% in value during the day to day fluctuations. IMHO BTC price should only be shown at the end with a timeout window. If the timeout window is kept to 5 minutes or under that would only expose merchants to perhaps 1-5% volatility instead of 23% that we saw within an hour on april 1st

A tremendous amount of pollution. All of the costs from cc fraud , check fraud , corruption, and chargeback fraud have to be amortized across the whole ecosystem which is very damaging to the ecosystem and economy. Not only this but every single building and all the employees , investigators, enforcement , and regulators that are required to investigate fraud and correct it with registered value like fiat creates a tremendous inefficiency and therefore indirectly creates a tremendous amount of pollution. 
The single best thing you can do for the environment in almost every case is not having a child, and what happens when that child is forced to drive to work and work all day trying to apply band aids to an insecure system instead of placing ones efforts towards something more productive?
With Bitcoin's security model most of the effort is on one securing their private keys themselves upfront instead of cleaning up messes after the fact in an inefficient manner. 
Not to mention all of the consequences from registered value like Identity theft(not really a concern for bitcoin) and how much damage that does.

Median welfare package in US per family is ~28k a year, so dropping that and accepting 24k a year from 2 adults + burden from 10 % VAT tax isn't an improvement . If they keep the welfare, now they have to pay a new 10% VAT tax in addition so the average welfare recipient is harmed either way. 


Government programs/taxes rarely end once they are created , and being that VAT only brings in 800B of the 4 Trillion needed I am skeptical to his promises when he makes all sorts of unfounded assumptions on such an untested economic policy.

Proper regulation involves the consensus rules within Bitcoin, and not him imposing a 10% VAT tax on Bitcoin every time someone uses it. 


He isn't clear on getting rid of that and it appears if anything he will simply increase taxes like with VAT being added ontop of sales tax. 


Are you aware that almost no one is claiming taxes on Bitcoin? Are you aware that US exchanges like coinbase do not report you to the IRS if you sold under 20k usd of btc in a year and had less than 200 transactions? This means you can sell 100k usd of BTC with a few txs and not be reported to the IRS thus only daytraders trading shitcoins are reported. Are you aware that if you spend your BTC with bitcoin companies they aren't reporting it but might start to with the VAT requirements that people like Yang are proposing(because that is how VAT works)


the regulations are clear in the USA, capital gains applies.

This sets a very bad standard if either developers or miners can force hard forks on the community. HFs must find a way to gather approval from the community first. 
Something akin to this - 
Step one , should be to discuss a HF with all companies or larger economic nodes in the bitcoin ecosystem like this - 
To see if there is consensus around a HF proposal.
Step 2 is to solicit opinions and feedback from all devs of all repos and implementations
Step 3 is to open it up to feedback from all bitcoin users to gauge support

No , If the blocks are 8MB than they will contain 8MB worth or tx data. The weight balances the tx data according to their resource usage thus 8MB under BU can be far worse than segwit with 8million units of weight and a 8MB size.

What is being asked to be compromised has nothing to do with the "number of lanes" but a HF activation proposal which fundamentally shifts at least 1 rule that economic users control over to the miners where consent from economic users is ignored. 
1) If it was about wanting 4 to 8MB blocks instead of 2-4MB blocks than what would be proposed is simply raising the MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT to 8000000 instead of 4000000 as a segwit SF. 
2) If it was just to prove to the world that a HF can be done with Bitcoin than they would be pitching a much better HF proposal like JL spoonnet -  where economic users still control the validation rules and HF with a flag day. 
This is all about forcing through a controversial HF, make no mistake about it. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 05:59:26
HFs after segwit are safer because segwit balances resource concerns.
Segwit does increase the resource cost and blocksize which is both negative and causes centralization pressures. 
Read this for more details on the risks and costs -
But segwit is far safer way of increasing the blocksize than other proposals that merely increase  MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE and limit sigops because it balances resource considerations by adding the concept of weight which reduces UTXO bloat which is one of the greatest concerns ones has among other concerns. 
It appears you are stuck into thinking that 8MB segwit = 8MB non segwit in terms risk which is not true. Blocksize isn't the only concern!
Increasing the blocksize before segwit is more dangerous than increasing it after segwit.

Do not store your bitcoin on exchanges or webwallets
Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are familiar technically with bitcoin.  99 % of alts/ICOs are scams and it is best to understand the basics before investing.
Do not daytrade
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 
Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well 
Do not mine until you have done at least 100 hours of research
Do not invest your bitcoins in any investment schemes

Some misconceptions people have about maximalists-
1) maximalists do not suggest altcoins will cease to exist. Scams, fads, and pump and dumps will come and go.
2) many maximalists are perfectly happy to leave Bitcoin if it fails and support another chain if they have a good reason, as evident in the UASF movement. They just tend to prefer to focus on a single currency.
3) few maximalists suggest that fiat currencies or competing currencies will cease to exist, at least anytime soon
4) maximalists do not suggest that it is inevitable that Bitcoin will become the dominant currency , simply that it is the most likely project at this time to fulfill this role (just like USD is at this time). Bitcoin can indeed fail and is indeed an experiment.
5) Maximalism is simply an underlying understanding in the recognition that there will be one dominant currency (just like we have now with USD). Maximalism is simply an understanding of economics regardless the benefits or tradeoffs. It is simply more secure and more efficient to deal in one currency than barter between many currencies. 
6) Maximalists prefer to spend their efforts on one project because they have a greater understanding of the stakes and risks and rather insure one sovereign and secure currency succeeds rather than diluting ones efforts in many insecure and incomplete efforts which all fail

Those economic theories aren't matching with the data . Not only does onchain and offchain volume spike during periods of rapid deflation/appreciation(this can go on for a while as we have seen multiple times in the past) , but merchant processors like Bitpay and coinbase see more spending on goods and services as well. We also see a sharp uptick in charitable giving.
During a boring sideways market we see people spend their BTc when need an item , and during inflationary periods like the bear markets during 2014 and 2018 slightly less likely to spend their BTC. 
The reality is people spend when they need to and its akin to buying a cell phone or laptop ... Sure you can wait 6 months and get the latest better model or buy the out of date model for a significant discount , but most people will spend now because they need the products now. People aren't going to stop spending on things they need, and it is highly improbable that a slight 2% inflation causes people to run out and spend their fiat either.

You don't need a blockchain to insure scarcity of digital game assets.
either your game is centralized than you place the asset in your companies database 
Or its decentralized , than you use a solution like IPFS (like open bazaar uses) to insure all your hosts keep track of the game assets and they are scarce and unique.

The OP is referring to this company -  which allows you to take a 10k and up fiat loan and use BTC as collateral which you can get back in a year . They are basically making a cut between the interest they pay out and the interest they make from their loans. This is dangerous as they could be working fractionally.
So say you need 10k in fiat, you put up 20k in BTC in collateral(3.575BTC) and than start making monthly payments for the next year paying a little over 10% in interest.
Do not use this loan service!
1) if BTC dips in value you have 72 hours to meet the margin call and put in more btc or quickly pay off the loan or you lose the collateral
2) 10% interest is high, higher than many cc "loans" where you can consolidate your debt much lower APR
3) If you need fiat than simply sell some BTC rather than paying interest on a dangerous loan . It is irresponsible to not have a fiat savings account for emergencies.
Don't use the BIA interest savings account service either. Why? This is akin to storing your BTC on an exchange which can become insolvent. 6.2% is not worthwhile for the risk of losing all your BTC. Invest in the SP500 that will average 9.8% if you need to get interest , or just hodl BTC securely and it will appreciate in value.

Earlier versions of the code were distributed in Nov 2008 and it appears to be quite a coincidence that he chose the times out of all the newspapers in the world(many of which are more popular than that newspaper)
At minimum we should fall back on "we don't know", rather than assume it was merely a coincidence. 
Satoshi's exact politics seems to be unclear but there is a lot of evidence that he was very skeptical of governments and possibly libertarian leaning.


This being said, Satoshi's opinions and politics don't mean much as Bitcoin is a much bigger project than 1 man and very useful to people of many political persuasions.

You are likely talking about Dave at

This only works if you are missing one or 2 words or if you have a vague idea of a passphrase protecting your HW wallet and have a vague idea what it might be than he sometimes can brute force it. Of course it would be impossible to brute force the 12 or 24 word backup as that has an impressive 2048^12 or 2048^24 set of combinations. actually since BIP 39 supports 8 languages you can multiply the above by 8 for a far larger number. These numbers might not seem big, but that is simply because humans are horrible at understanding large numbers or high entropy such as this.

Than why did you insinuate that 90% could be collected? What is the point in a 90% tax rate if only 42% is collected? Setting it high doesn't mean you magically are more efficient at collecting taxes.

A proper study would create several planned communities that would accept volunteers where aspects like age, race, sex, income were all controlled for between tests. Communities would need to live in equal environments and with equal access to resources. It would be better if the study was a double blind one where the direct researchers and participants were misled into the intentions of the study that would later be revealed.

Ahhh, you believe that Core will simply roll over and keep producing code and maintaining bitcoin if Classic take over governance at the direction of JToomin. This isn't likely. 
These are the far more likely scenarios if classic ever reaches 75% - 
1) Bitcoin Splits and 2 alts are created "ClassicCoin" and "Corecoin" where one has to make changes to the consensus mechanism to protect against 51% attacks of the dominant one(multiple solutions)
2) Some core developers join Classic, some leave and develop for another alt , some leave cryptocurrency altogether. This will slow progress and segwit/LN. ect...
3) Classic gets 75% and during the 28 day countdown Core devs commit to a future date for a 2Mb HF thus attracting enough miners to drop Classic support below 51% and prompting classic devs to warn user to patch their implementations so they don't HF with a minority amount of hashpower

This sets a very bad standard if either developers or miners can force hard forks on the community. HFs must find a way to gather approval from the community first. Having either miners or devs lead HF opens us all up to new attack vectors. Additionally, there isn't good evidence that shows 8MB blocks is safe in 1.5-2 years. 
Perhaps before setting a flag date one should at least seek consensus first like 
Step one , should be to discuss a HF with all companies or larger economic nodes in the bitcoin ecosystem like this -

Here is some general info for starting out as well – 
Do not store your bitcoin on exchanges or webwallets
Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are extremely familiar technically with bitcoin
Do not daytrade
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts
Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI)
Do not mine until you have done at least 100 hours of research
Do not invest your bitcoins in any investment schemes
and for a larger list of resources go here –
**Wallet recommendations:**
Store it in a segwit wallet for better security and much less expensive transaction fees.
**Wallets with segwit:** armory, trezor, ledger, Green address , Greenbits, Samourai wallet , core (manually) 
If you use an insecure OS like windows or OSX and cannot afford a HW wallet store your BTC in Samourai wallet, Green address , Greenbits  on a cell phone.
If you have a lot of bitcoins you will want to use either paper wallets or hardware wallets.
Paper wallets are not for beginners but if you want to educate yourself read this- 
If you need a multi currency wallet the only three secure ones available now are ledger , trezor and digital bitbox .

r/btc is a subreddit filled with people who support the Bcash altcoin and hate Bitcoin and use lies and propaganda to get people to buy into their coin. 
Bitcoin does indeed have higher onchian fees than BCH , but ...
1) BTC has much lower tx fees on lightning network 
2) BTC is much more secure and decentralized
3) BTC is much less volatile and more liquid
4) Fees are priced in BTC , so if BTC is much more valuable than an altcoin it will have higher fees in fiat 
5) Many other alts have lower fees than BCH, low fees are a symptom of a blockchain that almost no one uses and is insecure


Sure, best bet for lowest fees is use native segwit and RBF to bump a fee if needed , and lightning when you can

My statements were 100% factually correct, and the reason I specifically gave the example of miners choosing to include Tx's or not is because what you were alluding to. Let the users choose whether or not they want to pay more or less for tx's, just the same as miners can choose not to collect of tx fees in favor of smaller blocks even if the blocksize is increase to 8MB. You are attempting to take away user choice in this process and have the whole network subsidize spam with a HF increase rather than using segwit which rewards users with more capacity who reduce network impact.

This article is sponsored by BlockFI which allows you to take a 10k and up fiat loan and use BTC as collateral which you can get back in a year . They are basically making a cut between the interest they pay out and the interest they make from their loans. This is dangerous as they could be working fractionally.
So say you need 10k in fiat, you put up 20k in BTC in collateral(5.28BTC) and than start making monthly payments for the next year paying a little over 10% in interest.
Do not use this loan service!
1) if BTC dips in value you have 72 hours to meet the margin call and put in more btc or quickly pay off the loan or you lose the collateral
2) 10% interest is high, higher than many cc "loans" where you can consolidate your debt much lower APR
3) If you need fiat than simply sell some BTC rather than paying interest on a dangerous loan . It is irresponsible to not have a fiat savings account for emergencies.
Don't use the BIA interest savings account service either. Why? This is akin to storing your BTC on an exchange which can become insolvent. 6.2% is not worthwhile for the risk of losing all your BTC. Invest in the SP500 that will average 9.8% if you need to get interest , or just hodl BTC securely and it will appreciate in value.

1) Schnorr sig aggregation and MAST will allow many more transactions onchain without raising the blockweight limit
2) People migrating to Bech32 native segwit allows for more tx per block and thus lower fees 
3) Excess fee rate will encourage more txs to occur on payment channels like lightning, sidechains like Bakkt and liquid, and offchain which will free up space thus lower fees 
4) Most companies and individuals are still not batching txs.

The onchain fees can be amortized across many users. If a block can onboard up to 4 million users (without a hard fork) to use Bitcoin offchain with eltoo than fees will remain low. If you bother to research the info I provided you can see that a user can use eltoo without any direct onchain tx... and no this doesn't mean that onchain txs will not be needed anymore either as there will always be occasional channels closing and miners selling block rewards to exchanges and those exchanges loading payment channels

**Bech32 (Addresses that start with BC1)**
Pros -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~39-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block 
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
Cons- 
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now 
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
Pros - 
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
Cons -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion 
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32

Here are 2 suggestions for an easter egg games-
**Scavenger Hunt 1**
1) Create one or multiple BIP39 12 word backup(any wallet) wallets and tx some BTC into it. If you created 1 wallet print out all 12 words twice with the order number on little slips of paper so essentially you have 2 backups split one word per egg with a little candy in there as well. (minimum 24 eggs)
2) hide the eggs , and allow kids to recover the eggs. Since you duplicated the 12 words they will likely be able to find enough eggs to reconstruct the wallet together  and recover the BTC

Yes, one variable that would lead to more accurate 12 and 24 hour pessimistic time frames is by looking at the past week and seeing what the lowest fees cleared was. If a sustained fee market exists + a large mempool block depth than one would not likely expect the mempool to clear in 24 hours. Looking back during all of last year we do not see sustained elevated fee markets like we did at the end of 2017. 
Another variable one could take into account is too look at the relationship between Bitcoin volatility and the mempool as there is a correlation there as well.
It is also critical that users and wallets use a variety of fee estimators because using one algo will lead that to be gamed by spammers or miners.

I was using BU as an example to clarify that with segwit we have 8MB worth of txs data in 8MB worth of blocks to directly address your question concerning tx throughput.
Let me put it this way to clarify your question further ... 
Yes, if we didn't weigh resources accurately we could indeed include more or less txs in the same size block. Thus having a MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 8000000 could indeed have more txs than a segwit MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT = 8000000 block (or less depending on what txs are included) but the segwit block would be safer becuase it considered weight so I would be happier with a segwit MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT = 10,000,000 than a nonsegwit MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 8,000,000

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

Just like we are seeing with Ethereum right now where only a few full archival nodes exist as they are prohibitively expensive to sync and maintain. 
The Drop of 150k-200k Bitcoin Full nodes to a mere 100k Full nodes is a bit concerning as well, when we should be encouraging more full node adoption. Not everyone needs to run a full node, but right now the best we have is 300 light/web clients to every full node, and many of these full nodes are sybil nodes, users running multiple full nodes , or privacy destroying coin analytics full nodes making the ratio likely as bad as 1000 to 1.

Just mostly native segwit to see 14TPS averages
We are discussing limits here , and I made it really clear ~3.7MB is the limit.
With 4 million weight units the average limit of TPS on bitcoin with a 95+% segwit filled block is ~14 TPS If blocks are found 10 minutes apart from each other. If blocks are found sooner(happens all the time) this TPS limit can be much higher.
None of this includes future improvements which will increase onchain throughput like Schnorr sigs and MAST 
For maximum limits today the number is 20TPS per 10 minute blocks and 53.76 TPS for 100% batching

@_date: 2019-04-29 16:03:45


With batching , a single tx can represent thousands of txs and with splicing these can represent multiple actions. 


Without schnorr , mast , or further capacity increases . Thus this isn't the limit. Also batching is already occuring now so one should not assume this . One should say 32,252 is the maximum limit right now , but due to  mix of different txs in blocks the number is below this but above 12195.


The "roadmap" has never changed. The original proposal people signed off on included a future hard fork(which needs to occur anyways due to  ) 
We may decide to simply use an extension block or sidechain instead  however, but a hardfork will eventually be needed too. 


All this means is we have plenty of onchain capacity that people will be encouraged to use when fees start to rise. 


If they want to pay more to use outdated software that is their prerogative . Eventually I expect 90-95% segwit though due to the incentives 


The idea was to reflect the true UTXO costs by balancing the UTXO set and reducing UTXO bloat . 


There would be no advantage to do so as a hardfork and a large % of the Bitcoin community didn't want a hardfork. 


People should have a right to not use segwit if they want


This doesn't make sense, you are saying that the incentives are created to coerce segwit usage but than want to force them to use segwit with a hard fork? Are you listening to yourself?

Such a platform wouldn't be very useful IMHO because all those types of rudimentary tests are done independently by many people in the release candidates.
To answer you question though , all you need to do is setup a testnet wallet , get some free testnet coins from a faucet , and send BTC back and forth to do this test. Thus no need for a platform. 
Keep in mind that Bitcoin core has many "Unit tests" that auto test most of the code within itself which address your concerns. Many of the lines of code in new versions are the actual built in unit tests and not the code for new features. Thus the code itself has a built in "testing platform" that is automated and if anything we simply need more unit tests or better auditing of the code instead of setting up a testing platform because having the code itself automatically self check the functionality in real time is far better

I have never heard myself or other maximalists suggest that Bitcoin won't change. Almost all of the code in the Bitcoin project has changed during the last 10 years and there will be many more changes in the future. 
Perhaps this might be where the confusion lies - 
We are not suggesting things cannot change, as that is absurd because we are talking about software here, but that **we** consider a list of certain intrinsic properties of Bitcoin **prohibited** from changes , other properties as needing **unanimous consent**, and certain changes to be controversial. 
Here is an overview- 
What this means that if someone tries to change any of these Prohibited properties than we will either - 
1) Ignore the change and consider this an altcoin like the 50+ UTXO airdrops that already exist and carry on using Bitcoin . What matters(to us) is how we define Bitcoin, not others.
2) Consider Bitcoin a failed project and move onto other things 
Notice that SHA256 is not an intrinsic property to Bitcoin, thus maximalists could see themselves in a situation like we saw in 2017 with UASF where they are prepared to possibly switch PoW algos if miners do not eventually come back to Bitcoin.

Best way is for every country in the world to legalize everything and remove all regulations. Bitcoin would be practically worthless than. Bitcoin, ironically, is a hedge against anarchism. 


Bitcoin is a global currency so all it takes is a single government to have a problem with inflation or bail ins/bail outs to encourage a certain % of their citizens to run to Bitcoin with capital flight. 


Bitcoin will not replace Fiat in our lives. The best we can hope for is massive adoption where Bitcoin unseats the USD as the number 1 reserve currency/asset with higher liquidity and more stability than the USD. Thus we will see something like Bitcoin , USD fiat, EURO, Yuan in that order for reserve capitalization status. 
Bitcoin also will help keep good fiat currencies more honest due to competition. Stable forms of Fiat currencies are unlikely to stop having a target or being slightly inflationary(try and get politicians to spend less, I dare you!) so Bitcoin doesn't have much of a concern that they will compete as a disinflationary currency.

I'm a Tico living in Costa Rica , have helped several businesses accept Bitcoin here , and many people invest , but they are all extranjeros living here full or part time.

Cash app in the USA is pretty close with 0 fees
Here is a complex price analysis comparing cash app to Coinbase, to coinbase pro I did a few days ago.
depends upon the amount you buy. A more reasonable amount would be 100 as a typical transaction for most. So when I do this on cash app I get 5295.75, and on coinbase pro I get 5236 (100-0.15%) so
0.01888 btc cash app
0.01906 coinbase pro
= 0.00018 BTC difference or 94 cents higher on cash app ... but also keep in mind that cash app lets you instantly purchase BTC with a deposit showing instantly where you lock in the rate like coinbase which has a 1.49% fee instead of waiting 1 week so a better comparison would be 5227 (100-1.49%) =0.01884 BTC so cash app actually has lower fees in this regards
Thus , if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar , but also likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount

It depends, many people in India and china still love gold, and some baby boomers and older like it... but there has been a general trend away from wanting it. Just watch the videos I linked to see. 
Millennials and Generation Z individuals grew up in a digital era , and dislike precisely what gold bugs love - specie or physical things over digital. 


That is part of the reason as banks and governments horde gold and not silver. 


I agree, no way they will completely get rid of gold. It will be a very slow transition. Where I doubt myself is some countries may be forced to dump their gold quickly because that is what they needed to do with their silver when governments where speculating on the reserve PM.

This is a good start. PoW security is a bit more complex than this as there are a few other considerations such as -
1) How decentralized mining is as having confirmations coming from many independent pools is prefered over a few pools. 
2) Does the coin share an algo with another coin with a much larger hashrate 
3) Can a botnet easily attack your coin 
One great thing about Bitcoin is that SHA256 requires the newest ASICs which can only mine a small list of SHA256 coins. This means Bitcoin is immune from botnet attacks unlike many other coins . It also means that competing SHA256 coins can easily be attacked by a bitcoin pool so the security exists to the coin with the most hashrate. Memory hard GPU coins also have another problem of having a small % share of total GPU hashrate due to so many coins competing for this hashrate with a very large amount of outside available hashrate for rent that can be used to attack them.... often referred to if a coin is nice hashable or not .

All you are saying is that Bitcoin blocks are more efficient with more txs on 1.73MB blocks and less efficient throughput if blocks hit 3.7MB... GREAT! Also keep in mind , since segwit balances UTXO costs a 3.7MB segwit block is nowhere near as bad as a 3.7MB non segwit block(like on an altcoin)

Gold is an excellent store of value but a horrible investment. Even the SP500 at ~9.8 % compounded yearly beats gold by almost 4x, Thus an investment like Bitcoin puts gold to shame.
In the short term(1-2 years) Bitcoin due to volatility is worse as a store of value than gold. In the long term , its not only a better store of value , but one of the best investments you can make.
I sold all my gold for BTC after realizing this. Also gold isn't very divisible, is harder to secure, is harder to validate, is more difficult to send , and almost no one accepts it as a currency unlike Bitcoin.
Gold will likely become less of a valuable asset much akin to salt, aluminum, purple dye and many more examples. This is due to newer materials having superior properties like carbon nanotubes being far better heat conductors and electrical conductors than gold. The other thing to consider is in the next 100 years asteroid mining will be very prevalent(could start happening in as soon as 20 years commercially) which would dramatically flood the market with gold making it far less scarce unlike Bitcoin
In a mad max scenario I would want to trade in bullets, fuel, and medication primarily. Gold would be very low on my priority list of items to want and secure.

Gold is an excellent store of value but a horrible investment. Even the SP500 at ~9.8 % compounded yearly beats gold by almost 4x, Thus an investment like Bitcoin puts gold to shame.
In the short term(1-2 years) Bitcoin due to volatility is worse as a store of value than gold. In the long term , its not only a better store of value , but one of the best investments you can make.
I sold all my gold for BTC after realizing this. Also gold isn't very divisible, is harder to secure, is harder to validate, is more difficult to send , and almost no one accepts it as a currency unlike Bitcoin.
Gold will likely become less of a valuable asset much akin to salt, aluminum, purple dye and many more examples. This is due to newer materials having superior properties like carbon nanotubes being far better heat conductors and electrical conductors than gold. The other thing to consider is in the next 100 years asteroid mining will be very prevalent(could start happening in as soon as 20 years commercially) which would dramatically flood the market with gold making it far less scarce unlike Bitcoin

personally I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi) than the base layer because:
1) The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical 
2) I want to use a coin where people can choose to be transparent or private 
3) In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC

The  definition and historical use of the term fiat are intrinsically tied to an authority declaring it a currency. Bitcoin lacks this authority.. and some people don't even use it or consider it a currency and others consider it a currency and an asset.


Pieter is one of the best developers we have but I disagree with his suggestion that Bitcoin doesn't have any intrinsic value. This is an old myth spread by gold bugs. Value is subjective and what humans place upon it. Bitcoin's intrinsic value is tied to its utility for regulatory arbitrage. Yes , I'm aware that "intrinsic value" is often referred to melt value or value independent from its use as a currency but Bitcoin has value independent from its use of a currency as well because its used as a smart contract asset and time stamping asset as well or digital gold store of value asset outside its currency uses. 
Fiat has plenty of intrinsic value because its a very useful unit of account as well
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:09:32
Bitcoin primary raison d'etre is regulatory arbitrage or skirting around regulations to find efficiencies. Without laws, regulations, and states stealing wealth with taxes and corruption around the world Bitcoin would be mostly useless. Thus , indirectly, States subsidize the value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not depend upon white market use cases (although those only assist Bitcoins utility) and has a circular economy of inelastic demand from the black and grey markets .
Thus, ironically, Bitcoin becomes a hedge against Anarchy where it should continue to do fine as long as regulations(ethical or unethical) exist to warrant the need for Bitcoin. The more corrupt and byzantine governments become the more valuable Bitcoin becomes in order to protect the people within the jurisdiction as well.

Here is some general info for starting out as well – 
Do not store your bitcoin on exchanges or webwallets
Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are familiar technically with bitcoin.  99 % of alts/ICOs are scams and it is best to understand the basics before investing.
Do not daytrade
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 
Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well

depends upon the amount you buy. A more reasonable amount would be 100 as a typical transaction for most. So when I do this on cash app I get 5295.75, and on coinbase pro I get 5236 (100-0.15%) so 
0.01888 btc cash app 
0.01906 coinbase pro
= 0.00018 BTC difference or 94 cents  higher on cash app ... but also keep in mind that cash app lets you instantly purchase BTC with a deposit showing instantly where you lock in the rate like coinbase which has a 1.49% fee instead of waiting 1 week so a better comparison would be 5227 (100-1.49%) =0.01884 BTC so cash app actually has lower fees in this regards
Thus , if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar , but also need to likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount

One source would be the tx volume onchain and within exchanges but of course many would say that is speculative activity. My source comes from Coinbase and Bitpay merchant processors who reported that they see increased buying goods and services during rapid appreciation(deflation). It is also very obvious to anyone who has been paying attention as people are buying vacations, buying new cars and homes,  huge charity donations like we see with pineapplefund and tetherisfiat giving away millions during the time of a massive bull market. People spend their money because they feel wealthier , because they are wealthier.

**Economic Full nodes validate transactions and enforce the consensus rules of Bitcoin**(spinning up thousands of non economic sybil nodes has little effect upon your personal economic node)
**Miners order transactions in blocks and validate transactions as well**
More info -
Running software that fully validates all the rules like - 
Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is ~210GB for an archival node
Pruned nodes can get down to around 5GB , and have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it (It actually prunes as it validates)
You are only truly p2p if you are running a full node . running light clients depend upon you trusting a middleman and typically only validate block headers. Light clients are exposed to many more threats full nodes are not. There are also privacy concerns with light clients that full nodes are secure against. The whitepaper only suggests SPV "light" nodes in the context of fraud alerts(proofs) existing but thus far none exist and therefore you shouldn't trust large amounts of btc with a light client.
The most secure , "active" wallet would be a hardware wallet integrated with a full node . One way to do this easily is to run your own electrum server     and than integrate electrum wallet with your HW wallet and connect to your electrum server. A new solution is Blockstream green which works with ledger , trezor one , and trezor model T 
There are close to 98k  full nodes on the bitcoin network .(Some sites show much lower numbers because they exclude most non listening full nodes. )

75% of miners is merely an indirect and imprecise representation of the bitcoin economy. The Bitcoin economy is represented by investors, users, merchants, miners,  pymt processors, and exchanges. When a fork occurs with a **low consensus** threshold there are many potential problems. Anybody has any "right" to fork at any threshold between 51%-100% , but just be aware of the consequences when a low threshold is set. I understand that some may be under the impression that we are merely scaremongering but the threat is real. Please research into the 2013 hardfork crisis. During the ~1 hour hard fork crisis in 2013, double spending did occur and if a contentious fork occurred this year the split will last much longer than 1 hour. What do you think the exchanges and merchant processors do, lose all their money or shutdown until consensus is met? What happens to the price of both coins in the interim? How would an attacker exploit this hardfork?

For good and bad consequences, Bitcoin is first going to be adopted by the wealthy before going mainstream. Thus there will be a tremendous wealth transfer but not as dramatic as many are expecting. The Nouveau riche will be some of the few early developers and crypto anarchists, but we are already seeing examples of wealthy buying into BTC.  A good percentage of millionaires and billionaires will remain in control because they are wise enough to invest in Bitcoin. 
This is especially true with the fact that there are 2,208 billionares in the world and all it takes is a single one to invest a modest 1% of their portfolio in Bitcoin as a hedge and that is enough to send Bitcoin skyrocketing in price due to its rarity. Since none of these billionaires will likely telegraph their intentions beforehand because they want to get the lowest price for BTC , Bitcoin is likely to continue to be volatile for some time.
In a sense , having the establishment buy into Bitcoin is both a risk and tremendous advantage to our security.

THe statement is not inaccurate, but can be a little misleading due to the fact that there are nuanced differences. Another distinction is that since Bitcoin has a much larger community of users and transactions and on and off ramps BTC is afforded a little more privacy than monero as BTC is not a privacy only coin and I am sure there is more scrutiny with the monero on and off ramps than BTC because of this. Merely using monero brings more suspicion where using BTC doesn't because BTC isn't a privacy coin. This doesn't mean BTC+ wasabi is more private , just that there are differences between the 2.

Good article , to add to it :
1) ASIC's are actually extremely efficient at converting electricity to heat. +99% efficient. This heat can be recycled.
2) Almost all mining is being done with renewable energy right now. Most principally unused hydroelectric in china that would simply go to waste without those ASIC farms capturing the energy
3) When comparing the energy used in mining to traditional fiat you must analyze all the energy consumed in regulation, auditing, accounting, building infrastructure, security, ect to fairly compare the 2 
There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

Blockstream is a major contributor to Lightning development with multiple developers contributing to the ecosystem including 2 full time paid ones like Rusty Russell and Christian Decker, so I don't think they need to "acknowledge" Lightning since they are one of the few companies that is actively developing it. 
The reason why they likely avoided answering the question "when lightning" is the company has a better history of delivering working products rather than making promises and failing to deliver and LN integration is dependent upon many other variables so they could not possibly accurately give any ETA.

Why does spending and charitable giving rapidly increase in Bitcoin when there is an appreciation bubble or when so many "expert" economists predict a "deflationary death spiral" due to hoarding? I am not refering to wash trading on exchanges or speculative txs , but higher amounts of charity and merchant processing for real goods and services during these bull markets of rapid appreciation.

I agree this should be a feature when it is useful = Bitcoin is not volatile and a good unit of account. Right now I can't really comprehend too many businesses that would find much use for it besides moral signalling and if they care so much than they should submit the code(PR for code are welcome) instead of just asking others to code for them. 
Personally, I don't want to see the BTC amount before the shopping cart as its way too volatile and can add to support costs. I.E... Client sees an item with a 0.01 BTC price than comes back to cart an hour later and sees the price is now a much higher 0.0125 BTC for the same item which in turn will lead to a unhappy customer and possible support ticket. But perchance you mean to say that fiat is not even shown at all? If this is the case you don't really need a merchant shopping platform and can simply have a QR code with order form

One of their most damaging principles to society is their fight against birth control and condoms throughout the years. I agree with much of Christian ethics and also agree with their stance on abortion for the most part , but fighting against birth control has done immeasurable harm, and brought more suffering and poverty on the world. Perhaps you disagree....

Physical USD in some aspects is currently more fungible than BTC and some aspects less fungible. 
The very fact that it only exists physically, thus any deposit to convert it digitally is traced and far less fungible than BTC . 


The article explains how fungibility is damaged and the consequences of such. Having the DEA issue blanket subpoenas to the merchants and operators of these ATMs is indeed a burden with many costs from time , to legal fees and also likely illegal.

All exchanges have a spread . Here is a complex price analysis comparing cash app to Coinbase, to coinbase pro I did a few days ago. 
depends upon the amount you buy. A more reasonable amount would be 100 as a typical transaction for most. So when I do this on cash app I get 5295.75, and on coinbase pro I get 5236 (100-0.15%) so
0.01888 btc cash app
0.01906 coinbase pro
= 0.00018 BTC difference or 94 cents higher on cash app ... but also keep in mind that cash app lets you instantly purchase BTC with a deposit showing instantly where you lock in the rate like coinbase which has a 1.49% fee instead of waiting 1 week so a better comparison would be 5227 (100-1.49%) =0.01884 BTC so cash app actually has lower fees in this regards
Thus , if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar , but also likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

In my experience , even the poorest of us have expensive smartphones. Even those making 1,500 c an hour (2.50 usd) have an expensive smartphone as everyone simply gets a loan here.

If people are mostly using Bitcoin as a currency in a nation , governments cannot simply print more fiat to fund a war as they will be at a much greater risk from destroying their economy with hyperinflation. This means that Bitcoin will never eliminate wars but just make unpopular or unjust wars much more difficult because they will need to be funded by taxes, tariffs and war bonds rather than just spending.

Capital Gains are included in these numbers as that is considered income with the IRS. The reason why the wealthy accept stock shares more often than the average person is to reduce their tax exposure because it is much higher burden than the average US american. The top 5% of those in the USA pay around 58% of all income taxes , and they pay most the other forms of taxes as well.

What is being asked to be compromised has nothing to do with the the exact desired blocksize but a HF activation proposal which fundamentally shifts at least 1 rule that economic users control over to the miners where consent from economic users is ignored.
1) If it was about wanting 4 to 8MB blocks instead of 2-4MB blocks than what would be proposed is simply raising the MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT to 8000000 instead of 4000000 as a segwit SF.
2) If it was just to prove to the world that a HF can be done with Bitcoin than they would be pitching a much better HF proposal like JL spoonnet -  where economic users still control the validation rules and HF with a flag day.
This is all about forcing through a controversial HF, make no mistake about it. They want to set a standard where HFs are trivial and occur often where either devs or miners can impose changes upon unwilling users. There is no compromise to be made with HFs controlled by either devs or miners instead of users because it centralizes bitcoins control and makes it much more vulnerable to many attacks in future.

Very, For others , here is why :
**Bech32 (Addresses that start with BC1)**
Pros -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~36-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection -  (Wallets can be developed to tell you where you made a mistake in addition of mistakes that allow for valid addresses being created much more unlikely)
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
5) Removing characters that are easily misread
6) able to render QR codes in alphanumeric mode, making them smaller/lower resolution.
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now

Those who spend their BTC on small items and sell it p2p often do not pay cap gains taxes. One main point of bitcoin is regulatory arbitrage so wanting to pay 10% VAT + 7% sales tax for every tx rather defeats most of the reason BTC exists. Also, making it commonplace to establish a standard like VAT that tracks much more information than sales tax is a dangerous precedent for consumers and merchants. My country just switched from sales taxes to VAT and its disastrous , and you are promoting both at the same time?

Yes, very nice and useful tool , would be great to incorporate some of the values of crypto51.app as well. Another aspect that people don't consider is security is much bigger than merely PoW.

I spend a few pennies for onchain fees all the time
Most of the people complaining about the long confirmation times are day traders that also want to pay a few penny tx fees , because retail merchants typically accept 0 confirmation txs. Thus we have issues where people want to pay a low priority rate of a couple pennies and than get upset that their BTC is available to daytrade on shitcoins in a day instead of ~1 hour with bcash. Speculating on shitcoins isn't what interests me but I suppose tools like liquid can help you with arbitrage.

Yes, I personally prefer client side privacy instead of protocol level privacy due to -
1) Using privacy on the protocol level has scaling tradeoffs ... monero is much less scalable than Bitcoin 
2) Pseudo-anonymous allows plausible deniability where you can best of both worlds by having some wallets transparent , and others private 
3) Monero and other privacy coins are much more likely to be banned by governments and exchanges or not be supported I the first place and liquidity is crucial 
This being said , monero has cheaper tx fees than using wasabi... but this again is not directly comparable because Bitcoin is much more secure. Also more wallets are implementing coinjoin so fees for mixing will drop on BTC - 
Lightning has great privacy as well so LN integrated with Samourai and wasabi will be amazing

The policy suggestions are ridiculous in the GND and will actually be harmful to the environment. It is patently obvious that the GND is merely virtue signalling without any serious solutions.
More realistic solutions would be a comprehensive plan to
1) Give further tax incentives for wind, hydro, solar power for individual consumers. This has another side effect of increasing energy independence.
2) More nuclear power
3) Building up sea walls in places like South Florida/ New Orleans because climate change is going to occur regardless of what the USA does because they make up around 15% of CO2 output worldwide and China and India are growing in pollution. The sea wall can be in part privately funded by incentivising businesses building ontop of them. 
4) Giving large tax credits to cruise ships or sea platforms that want to test some of the global dimming proposals (creating more cloud cover with sea water)
5) modernize the electric grid and pass regulation forcing public electric companies to buy back green energy created from homes and businesses into the grid. (In the USA some jurisdictions allow this , others do not)

You are making a fair point that perhaps there should be more disclaimers. As far as making X more fungible, that is a complex topic , because when I take my "clean" UTXO's and mix them with UTXOs coming from a drug dealer on the DNM I am indeed making his BTC more fungible, at the price of tainting my UTXO's. Thus the general idea is to taint most UTXOs in order for coin analytics tools to become far less useful. There is a transition to this where coinjoin is still not widely used and some temporary consequences can occur in which we should be forthcoming with others about. I myself am happy to slowly take my clean BTC and taint them in this effort knowing full well what I am doing.

What infrastructure is Elwar using without paying? He still needs to pay cell phone service and all applicable taxes. He still needs to pay for any boat insurance , taxes, and registration fees to come to the mainland. On the mainland he needs to pay for sales taxes. If he flies out of thailand he needs to pay entry and exit taxes. He needs to pay for road infrastructure indirectly when he rents a cab to get around. 
As we can see , he certainly should not pay for any security from the state as they are actively attacking him and want to kill him despite him not breaking any laws because his platform is in international waters.

**hodlwallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Much better UX than other wallets and slick look as it’s a fork of the original Bread wallet
Cons- lacks some privacy features found in electrum and samourai
**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration and advanced 2fa options
Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers.

These reasons :
1) In a bear market altcoins tend to suffer greater as liquidity goes to fiat and BTC
2) LTC primary reasons for existing are now moot. It is mostly centrally mined by a few asic farms (ASIC resistance was proven untrue) , the fees and confirmation time are much worse than BTC with LN txs 
3) The silver to bitcoins gold marketing has always been nonsense. In the digital world where BTC can already be divided to 1/1000 of a satoshi there is no need for silver unlike with physical gold and silver

This is a fine stance to take once you have investigated bitcoin , know how to secure it and are doing so for idealogical reasons. Unless you are a high risk banking client however than bitcoin is still riskier than USD fiat or getting 9.7% returns out of a US index fund. High risk , High return.
 I agree with your sentiments though because I'm an agorist therefore I'm not principally involved in BTC as a speculative asset, in fact it is more of a hedge against my political beliefs. Let me explain - The success of cryptocurrencies (and bitcoin in particular) is intrinsically tied to States and laws existing in the future because states heavily subsidize the price premium of btc for regulatory arbitrage, just like with illegal drugs. Thus I don't mind aggressively investing in btc because I'm doing so for ethical reasons and simultaneously taking a very practical and realistic hedge against my political beliefs(If society turned to anarchy than the value of BTC would dramatically drop)

You are correct that 1 node per community would be a huge improvement over the current status quo. since Bitcoin is intended for adversarial environments we have to make sure individuals might possible start up and verify their own txs. There are many scenarios where this may be prudent- community node blacklisting , censoring , poor security from those who run it, it being malicious, ect. I am not saying everyone needs to run a full node , far from it , but some people may need it more than others.

It also takes much more time correcting lies and misinformation while con artists continue to Gish gallop propaganda to those not technically savvy enough.

The idea is to eventually remove the variable MAX_BLOCK_SIZE altogether as weight is the only value we care about. Size doesn't represent an accurate picture of resource costs , weight does. 


Nope, If the weight allows 8 million units, than that is 8 million units worth of tx space. You are insinuating that there will only be 4million units of tx space for 8MB blocks which is false.

Ok, you have an odd definition of "base blocksize" because didn't the original "base blocksize" have signatures included? Now you must be redefining base blocksize to omit signatures , right?

Well there are many people who don't mind the risk of jailtime. I would rather do what is ethical than do what is legal personally, and if I am kidnapped and tortured so be it. 
Bitcoin has distinct qualities that are far superior than cash , more secure against asset forfeiture, able to take payments online, able to transfer large amounts easily, agorists prefer it for ethical reasons, ect...
So criminals will still choose to use bitcoin (and continue using cash) , even if one is penalized and the other not.
You keep repeating all the ways regulators can enforce laws, ignoring the fact that criminals care little about laws. Laws present an externality on them. Is it safer or  more efficient to money launder with bitcoin or cash? Is it easier to transport 100k accross state lines in cash or a micro sd card? Also you are ignoring that many of us are truly offended ideologically (something really important to humans ) that states have any say in our use of certain forms of communication and mathematics.

Average is less than 1% empty as you can see from the supplied data in OP. This means that it isn't a significant factor for empty space, we just aren't using up all capacity.


In context it is meaningless because in practice most miners have the limit at 1MB and the topic at hand is why there is unused capacity.  Take a look at   and see for yourself , blocks that are 750Kb are very rare. You can see tons of unfilled blocks.

I definitely agree that 1 confirmation is superior to credit cards in most cases for the merchant(remember bitcoin is still very volatile compared to USD ) . Merchants do not have to necessarily cover fraud with credit cards and users don't win all chargeback requests either , there is a dispute process that occurs. I will concede that a 0 conf btc tx done through coinbase or bitpay may incidentally and temporarily be more secure because the generous and good nature of our very small community that wants to encourage merchant adoption. This will quickly change as bitcoin grows in usage and more criminals figure out how to double spend. Thus 0 conf btc tx are inherently less secure than credit cards/chip and pin. This is why it is so important to secure instant tx before we start going mainstream.

I don't think this will have the intended effect you want. Bitcoin has always been "illegal" before certain states classified it and made it "legal". States reversing this position will have the following effects - 
1) Dry up most VC funding for bitcoin companies. Therefore less whitemarket services and products. Bitcoin than has to focus on what it does best - regulatory arbitrage.
2) Reflect some deep insecurities and fears within existing currencies and states and bring greater attention to bitcoin
3) Bitcoin will quickly transform into something far more secure and fungible (most important feature)
4) Business converting giftcards and point systems for btc (purse.io) will keep bitcoin trading and liquidity alive rather than regulated and sanctioned exchanges that allow transparency to regulators
5) decentralized marketplaces like openbazaar and dropzone would become more secure and explode in activity
Many of us would welcome efforts to make bitcoin illegal because we see the above points as something to be welcomed.  We all saw how effective "shutting down" napster was with file sharing, I welcome and encourage them to try and shutdown bitcoin.

To me it does, you just have a very different definition of what is radical and what tradeoffs you are willing to make. doubling capacity with segwit is already going to have negative effects due to larger blocksizes. Schnorr signatures may bump up on chain by another 33%. More than this is indeed radical before solving the problem with secure instant txs.

To start a safe and smart savings here are some of the most important tips- 
1) Get a Hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor
To secure your bitcoins. 
2) Do not get greedy and start investing in alts (bitcoin is a risky investment as is and alts are like very dangerous penny stocks) 
3) Do not download dangerous software that promises free btc or invest in schemes that promise returns like cloud mining sites or ponzi schemes. You should use a HW wallet and for day to day spending copay or mycelium on your cell phone . 
4) Spend btc on sites like purse.io to save 20% off amazon(no digital items , just physical items) , but always rebuy more btc first with trusted exchanges like circle/kraken. 
5) Do not day trade , there is a high chance you will lose money. Just buy on a regular basis or set limit buy orders in to grab the dips and hold to accrue a nestegg.

When you see extreme stability in currencies and the Bollinger bands tighten for a few days it is an indication that there will be a breakout either up or down soon. This is due to buyers and sellers fighting in a heated manner where one side has to give way. Once this happens human psychology and the bots take over. 
After about a week of unnatural stability if a breakout up or down doesn't occur than it becomes less and less likely with each passing day indicating a trend toward new plateaus of stability .

I gave several examples to answer your question , and we are not just discussing purse. You appear to be fixated on purse.io and I cannot of course quell your speculative fear based upon really poor evidence (a couple anecdotal examples) . cc fraud within purse.io could be as low as 0.1% or much higher. The volume of purchases online and the lack of many complaints appears to reflect that the percentage is low however, but this still won't placate your fears so don't use it and there is no point belaboring the point. 
Now to address your question without any fear of you participating in illegal activities(regardless of you committing felonies all the time- look it up but don't veer off topic in this discussion) lets take this common example. 
You live in the USA and are a savvy consumer. You understand the benefits and risks of both BTC and Fiat and how using the strengths of each can save a lot of money. You log into your gdax acct and place limit order buys at 5% below market price to buy on the dips because you understand that volatility isn't always a bad thing. Than you purchase electronic giftcards to almost any store for 3-5% discount that BTC provides. Even with the exchange fee of 0.25% and under this insures that you always make things 8% cheaper when you spend BTC. But you also can leverage BTCs volatility to your benefit and since you don't invest 100% in BTC you aren't at risk when BTC drops in value temporarily as you always save an equal portion of USD fiat. You make more and larger purchases when bitcoin spikes in value like what just happened yesterday which makes that discount more like 13% off everything.
Is this not reason enough to use bitcoin?
P.S...there are many more reasons to use bitcoin but I get the feeling you don't want to do anything illegal , don't value privacy, don't care that fiat supports some pretty unethical institutions , ect..
@_date: 2016-09-06 12:25:32
Go on Purse.io and use the giftcard to purchase some items for btc . Anyone would be a foolish for taking you up on this offer as they can get Giftcards with  cashback with amazon where they don't have any risks of fraud and exchanging an amzn card for btc is indeed dangerous. Amzn gift cards are non fungible and reversable payments and btc after a confirmation or two are much more fungible and non reversable which is the reason that you should never buy gift cards from strangers with btc

No the SF is cleaner way to implement Segwit.


Do you know that you can scale on chain without Hard Forks and without even touching the variable maxBlockSize?
Segwit does increase the blocksize(doesn't change the maxBlockSize variable though), Schnorr signatures will increase onchain capacity. There are multiple ways to increase capacity onchain with Soft Forks.

@_date: 2016-09-30 07:57:00
excellent rebuttals by nullc  - 
    I saw someone mention earlier that the Closed Captioning feature doubles as a transcript
AWESOME, thank you for the transcript.
    The reason, naturally, is that we can only have about 2 transactions a second[...] While all over the world people are sending about 5 transactions a second.
So I should be able to find 1800 MB of unconfirmed transactions created in the last 5 days alone? Where are they? ... They don't exist, these figures are untrue. Zander has understated the performance for median sized transactions by a factor of more than 3, and overstated the load relative to the capacity.
It's natural and expected for Bitcoin to always be at it's maximum. Though not its purpose, Bitcoin unavoidably provides a public highly replicated perpetual data store, with all costs externalized onto unpaid node operators. At a price of zero the demand is practically unbounded-- everyone would back up their computers into it (and some have tried).
If Bitcoin is to be successful as a decentralized currency it cannot afford to be burdened by acting as everyone's backup or messaging service, because -- due to physical limitations -- that could only be seriously attempted at a heavy cost to decentralization. But market forces control the usage, neutrally, by letting users bid fees for access to the capacity. This creates a revenue stream which we must have to support security as the subsidy goes away-- unless Bitcoin were to become perpetually inflationary like Monero or Ethereum. The fee mechanism is working and, in spite of claims by other Classic and XT creators there has been no "crash landing" or "death spiral", as a result. Instead, we find, the system works fine as designed.
    It's a bit like on a Bus stop and every 10 minutes a bus comes by with a maximum capacity, you can ask people to pay more fees to get onto the bus but that doesn't change the fact that people will be left in the cold and there is no way around that.
The late Ted Stevens might be impressed with the analogy here. But the Bitcoin blockchain is not like a bus in pretty much any way, nor are transactions like passengers. When someone creates a bus it isn't a single use event where every participant in the transit network needs to store a duplicate of that bus in their backyard forever. :)
A better analogy is to to compare the blockchain to a court. In the land of imagination people were worried about being defrauded in their transactions, to prevent this they were sure to take all their trades before the land's court so that the perfectly trustworthy judge would not allow anyone to spend funds they already spent or fail to deliver the funds that they promised. Over time the court became heavily used and courts do not scale especially well and so the people of imagination land instead realized that they could arrange their business engagements with contracts and record keeping so that in the rare event of a dispute they could visit the court and obtain justice. But ordinary they wouldn't-- saving the court for disputes and other infrequent procedures and ceremonies (like name changes). Not only does this improve capacity, but it improves latency too-- you don't have to wait for the court to hear your case to make every purchase!
Likewise, in Bitcoin-- it's possible to transact without putting all our transaction data up for decision of the court (the whole network). In doing so, we can achieve true scalablity and improved privacy. There are many ways to accomplish this-- stemming back to the original channel mechanisms suggested by Bitcoin's creator (which Zander's 'flexible transactions' proposal attempts to remove), through things like transaction cut-through, or digital cash servers, and up to lightning-- the latest and most advanced of these tools. And just like for the courts of imagination, these systems also improve Bitcoin's latency dramatically-- something no amount of block size twiddling can accomplish.
    They never actually give any facts.
In fact a great many facts have been given, including measurements of the changes in network over time, testing on test network (in fact Bitcoin Classic's original developer finally tested larger blocks and concluded 4MB were the maximum, after which he was apparently kicked from the project), to simulation tools. But you Zander doesn't seem to care about these things.
    that ran a full import of Bitcoin's 7 years history. Using default settings and a modern, definitely not a super computer. The entire 7 years of history was parsed and imported in less than 7 hours.
The system in question was a six core 3.3 GHz system, at 19.8 total CPU*GHz it is the fastest CPU that Intel sells that works in a consumer motherboard. It benefited from the introduction of libsecp256k1, a product of years of hard work by Bitcoin Core, involving novel algebraic optimizations and number theory insights -- which had just made the signature validation more than 5 fold faster and which had been cited in the Core Capacity roadmap as one of the offsetting improvements that make the two megabyte blocks of segwit viable.
And yet it still took 7 hours. That is a lot of time to be tying up your computer just to get something installed and running. Many people don't have the patience for it, yet for decentralization we need many to participate. 7 hours would be a long time for your business to be down if you needed to reinitialize its node(s).
Worse,"7 years of history" is misleading: through most of Bitcoin's life Bitcoin had a 250k hard coded soft-limit. The whole history of Bitcoin is only as large as 1.5 years of the current rate of growth and less than 9 months of growth at the segwit rate. So his figure should have been 7 hours on a state of the art computer for 9 months of data. 7 hours now, then 14, then 21.... multiple days to sync after only a year or two of additional traffic... On today's state of the art processor, on a machine doing nothing else, and on an internet connection faster than many people in the US have available to them (7 hours is beyond what ADSL2+ could do).
For the last several years Core has put in heroic efforts to improve performance... and we now sync orders of magnitude faster than the original. Through these efforts that the growth of bitcoin hasn't pummeled the network. But the days of low hanging improvements are over and while a few improvements remain there won't be another libsecp256k1-- so it's a real shame that people like Zander exploit our hard work to use it as an argument that performance isn't a concern.
    What this home node managed is 650 times that.
Yes, a node must process blocks at many times faster than realtime to have any hope of catching up in an acceptable interval when starting or after being online... and for miners it must be many times faster too, or it creates "progress" in the mining process, making it more like a race where the fastest participant always wins rather than the lottery that Bitcoin's incentives and security depends on. Like other engineered works, the system also must have a safety margin, because it isn't acceptable for it to catch fire the first time something unusual happens or if there is a DOS attack.
What Zander doesn't mention is that Bitcoin Classic has now "accelerated" their syncup by cutting out validation: If a block's header, created by the miner that authored it, claims that the block was &gt;24 hours old (per cpu), all its signatures are just /assumed/ valid. This change undermines the incentives of miners to be honest about their timestamps: since fudging them would allow the miners claim large amounts of "lost" Bitcoins to share among themselves. This doesn't sound like an optimization that would be implemented by someone who thought the syncing performance was acceptable relative to the current load, but it's what bitcoin classic did.
    It is like arguing we should not run, or heaven forbid, get on a bicycle
For someone who complained about emotional arguments, our presenter sure seems to spend a lot of time with vague and distant analogies.
    is called XThin and it only sends about 42 kilobytes. Which is 24 times as small as the actual block size.[...] Well, first the obvious. The bandwidth needed for a node is cut in half.
The "24 times" is super disingenuous, ---
Long before Bitcoin Classic had "xthin", almost all miners were running the Fast Block relay protocol, which was created in response to orphaning induced mining centralization (that "lottery becomes race" issue). FBRP reduces the transfer time much more than xthin -- and the similar BIP152, which also predated Bitcoin Classic using Xthin. So for miners these later improvements have no effect, and without these improvements there might have been a single entity controlling mining now (at the time FBRP was created a single mining pool had amassed a majority hashrate)-- just due to the current load.
FBRP wasn't great for many peers, so it wasn't used by non-miners. For everyone else BIP152 was created. Tom's number of 50% however is impossible to achieve. The reason for this is because the amount of data sent and received by a node is roughly NumTransactions36peers + TransactionBytesPeers/10 + 2Transactionbytes ... and the best these protocols could possible do is reduce that last 2* to 1*. As a result, even perfect block compression has been measured to be only about a 15% bandwidth reduction.
It's a good reduction and it makes the nodes bandwidth usage less bursty and less likely to irritate its user-- it's an improvement that was cited as one of the justifications for segwit being an acceptable load increase back in December before any work on "xthin" (the BU's version of this technique) began. But it's important to not overstate it.

    Surfing Facebook watching pictures, movies can lead to 20MB usage every minute.
Facebook surfing on your web browser is not a globally synchronous consensus flooding system, and Bitcoin's operating cost isn't paid for by a huge company with billions in advertising cashflow-- it's supported by individual node operators that receive no payment for their participation. If the facebook load glitches, millions of dollars aren't potentially stolen. Facebook isn't decenteralized, it's not a bad thing that only one company runs it and can support its resource costs-- but if Bitcoin became centralized like facebook, Bitcoin would lose most of its purpose and be out-competed by systems that were designed to be centralized. I understand that inside Google-- a huge multibillion dollar company with tons of bright minds at it, that spares no infrastructure expenses-- there is a global consensus system which they use to track critical data like system mastership. This system lives in a trusted environment and doesn't need to be secure against strongly adversarial conditions. ... and yet google services are limited to store only a few hundred bytes per service in it and keep updates to a few kilobits per second.
The requirements of a global trustless decentralized consensus system for transactions are very different from the requirements of webpages.

I would agree they were different versions of PoS , but many of the security considerations are the same essentially since so many PoS altcoins have most of the stake controlled by a small group of developers and partners making the minority stake controlled elsewhere moot from a security aspect.

2) Don't trust any of this software on your computer or cell phone . Use another computer , linux usb live drive, or VM instance
3) don't use online web wallets to claim , only use offline wallets
Start with the highest value split altcoin first -

No, segwit is actually effectively doubling blocks. It doesn't happen all at once because of wallets transitioning over but Blocks will starts to be 1.8-2MB or bigger in time. There are other ways to double blocksize rather than just increase maxBlockSize variable, segwit will effectively double blocksize by adding a second merkel tree to the block.

I empathize with you that there probably isn't money to be made right now, but the last thing we need is more "open minded" interviews and podcasts. With the amount of scams and bullshit in our ecosystem we need way more cynical and skeptical podcasts and interviews. You don't have to scream scam or be obnoxious either and can even subtly reveal the flaws and problems with subtle questions and many of the people being interviewed would probably not even notice. The interviews on Epicenter aren't just open minded but you lap the shit the interviewers push up and even smile and agree with it often. I don't mean to suggest you are intentionally trying to deceive your audience but merely always giving the benefit of doubt to your guests and trying to be pleasant and nice... this is the last thing you should do.

Ethereum is a premined scam.
1)	Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense  to the credulous. 
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.
Additionally, there are plenty of ICO's who have locked up Ethereum's and need to constantly sell them for fiat to pay for their burn rate going into next year which places a constant negative pressure on ETH price

There is a significant difference with immutability with PoW and PoS .

One of the limiting factors with nodes crashing is RAM. 2GB of RAM is now recommended as a minimum for Full nodes to prevent this from happening with a 1MB block limit in place . Can you get VPS for 3.50 a month with 2GB of RAM allocated? Would you be ok with forcing whole countries or large parts of countries to only use VPS based nodes for 20 dollars a month(higher if we raise the blocksize limit)? Personally, I would like a diversity of full nodes controlled by businesses and individuals in every country. Full nodes are important to properly bootstrap new users. Perhaps in the future we can have better fraud proofs or a sharded blockchain with fraud proofs but lets create that tech first before bumping more nodes offline. The trend needs to be reversed. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 14:42:17
Most bitcoin users don't care about the blocksize debate or know much about it. There is a spectrum of opinions and even a large group of bitcoin users who could care less if fees even creep up to 50 pennies per tx as their primary concern is fungibility and privacy. 
what is undeniable is that a majority of nodes use bitcoin core, a super majority of mining mines with bitcoin core, a supermajority of developers support bitcoin core , a super majority of nodes of  banks, processors and exchanges use use bitcoin core, and most users either don't care or choose to follow the specialists lead. 
The only category that may be the exception is payment processors who have high sensitivity to tx fees in their business model. Bitpay a few months ago switched and supports cores roadmap but circle and coinbase and some other banks and processors prefer a more aggressive capacity approach regardless of using core nodes.

1) This happens naturally - 
There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the cost of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.
Watch this video -
2) They are not related directly. The amount of energy in value spent with ASICs or other means outside ASICs will always tend to correlate with the value of Bitcoin.
Ask yourself this question:
If anyone is open to mint money , would they not be willing to spend at least 99%+ of the cost to mint it to realize a profit even if it didn't involve buying ASICs or burning electricity?

But it isn't . Its a really old idea and working with digital currencies predates bitcoin by many years. 


There are distinctions between both however. Certainly Pow has many attack vectors; I am merely suggesting that PoS has a much wider attack surface and is less efficient. 


As of yet. Perhaps another means to objectively secure a blockchain will surface that is better, but a big part of the misunderstanding is that people don't seem to understand that the work and expense in PoW is what objectively secures the network. The security mechanism must be objectively measurable and trustlessly measurable. It must be easy to validate and granular in adjusting. It must also be simple enough for competition to enter the ecosystem and disrupt. This is no small feat, and automatically will make other provable work solutions like proof of hard disk space to be less ideal.  When PoS proponents attack the cost or waste of Pow it reflects a deep misunderstanding of what is trying to be accomplished here.

Segwit allows approximately double the amount of txs as before if 100 % of tx are segwit within a block or ~14 TPS (transactions per second) onchain average(keep in mind onchain throughput can increase beyond 14 TPS due to the poisson distribution in finding blocks or increases in hashrate) 
It depends upon the transaction size, but for the theoretical current max without MAST or schnorr sigs here is the math
**12,195 transactions transactions per block max** (unlikely we will ever see this reached due to the variety of transactions within a block that are normally included.) Schnorr sigs and MAST can both increase these numbers though

They are not arguing for decentralization of everything. In fact most maximalists I speak to have a very nuanced opinion of decentralization and can and will discuss the benefits , costs and tradeoffs of such. Many would specifically say that centralization is preferred in many matters. 


Maximalists don't suggest that people should not have choice or be restricted from creating their own coin(remember with UASF many maximalists were going to create and follow a new chain even if it was a minority one.) The recognition that there will be one dominant currency (just like we have now with USD) is simply an understanding of economics regardless the benefits or tradeoffs.

Difficulty is Dynamic and goes up and down ever 2016 blocks. 
Miners often have fixed electrical contracts and thus will continue mining even if temporarily unprofitable due to these sunk costs 
Many miners use green energy which has no costs to use besides an initial sunk costs and small maintenance. 


You are now changing the subject now. Yes, of course Bitcoin is less secure if the value goes down, this has nothing directly to do with profitability in mining . Keep in mind that hashrate for Bitcoin is still extremely high due to improvements in ASICs


I expect a long a healthy future for fiat and the US. Fiat currencies and economies compete with each other and the US will not be dominant forever however. Bitcoin will continue to do great as long as Governments exist and laws exist. Bitcoin is a hedge against anarchy, thus the best way to destroy the value proposition of Bitcoin is for all governments to legalize everything and dissolve themselves.

Yes , most of these in person payments are being secured by the nature that bitcoin is still a small mostly unused payment method which has a userbase that wants to promote it among merchants and some of the fraud is eaten up by payment processors , and very few in person merchants accept it. Merchants can also rely on security through potential security cameras or eyewitnesses which will discourage double spending for really inexpensive items . As bitcoin grows there will be many people who use it simply as another currency and not for ideological reasons, coupled with the fact there will be more merchants to target thus increasing the risk exposure for double spend attacks on 0 confirmations for more expensive items 50-500 USD ... merchants accepting in person anonymous 0 conf tx over 500 USD are really crazy IMHO.

Proof of Stake is not new or very interesting, and exists as a form with fiat currency already.
Proof of stake has many more attack vectors(nothing at stake attacks, long range attacks, short range attacks , stake grinding attacks) than proof of work and ultimately is either less efficient or less secure.
Further reading -
There doesn't seem to be any foreseeable solutions to making proof of stake secure either besides obscuring the flaws. Bitcoin is deliberately made inefficient with proof of work as using provable work that is external to the blockchain is the only means to create real costs where the game theory supports a model where it is both profitable to secure BTC and extremely costly to attack it.
With PoW (proof of work) you would need to be a tremendous amount of effort in order to censor 1-2 blocks with building many asic mining farms, and than burning the electricity continuously in order to attack bitcoin.
With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before) to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff such an attack because it involves outside resources.
There are many different variations of proof of stake but the simplest way to understand this is by looking at those blockchain's as a democratic consensus mechanism where everyone's vote is weighted based upon how many coins or stake they control. Their staked coins than have an opportunity to create a block without proof of work and a dev controlling 51% of the coins gets to virtually mint ~51% on average of all the blocks . This presents another concern as the coins typically need to be in "hot wallets" to do so instead of cold storage leading to a more insecure environment.
Since most PoS coins have massive premines where only a small number of devs control most of the coins this also presents another concern as those devs can be targeted by states , hackers, or attackers or as we often see with altcoin devs they pump and dump a project and than move onto a competing project to repeat this cycle over and over again thus have an incentive to attack their old project.
With Proof of work , seizing the coins or stake of any individual or group of people doesn't effect the process of mining or securing the network directly at all . They can only try and spook the market by dumping coins at a discount while individuals like myself will happily buy up all the discounted coins.
PoS is being sought because it is a clever marketing ploy to attract environmentalists who are concerned about the electricity used in PoW mining. They may have valid concerns that I also share but they fail to see all the external costs in PoS. It is akin to not adding up all the inefficiencies in coming to a consensus in a democratic presidential election.
There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.

Incorrect. The first blocks were the most expensive to mine as one had to expend effort and electricity before Bitcoin had any value.


What makes you believe this? Block reward = Block subsidy + tx fees , thus block reward is unlikely to ever go away unless everyone stops using bitcoin

most of Bitcoins largest periods of appreciation happen in a few days each year thus spreading out ones investments over a month will lower the probability that you invest in before these events occur. 


Investing small amounts in different less trusted exchanges is part of the research process to test the trustworthiness of an exchange and not really a DCA strategy. 


Agreed , but this is all part of the learning and research phase before one makes a decision. Thus I agree , new users need to initially buy a very small amount of BTC to learn how to use it and secure it and spend it .
The question is , once you understand Bitcoin and believe it is scarce and will appreciate in the long term what do you do when you inherit or get a bonus of a small amount of 10k USD? Do you DCA it over a month or do You immediately invest all 10k between BTC and other investments you have already decided upon?
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:56:47


spend and replace is a form of hodling. When I do this I never decrease my BTC savings and often increase it. 


Not all merchants dump BTC for fiat, some keep the BTC and some sell a % of BTC. Thus when I rebuy it can actually can help Bitcoins price. 
I also have another strategy to help Bitcoin become less volatile (this is critical for a the utility as a currency) . I rebuy back at market price and than any additional BTC I want I put in various BTC buy limit orders which decreases volatility =  Buy support is an important aspect of liquidity
@_date: 2016-09-01 22:20:48
I do that as well but there are several problems with everyone doing this. First one is the added cost. For VPS' you are looking at around 20 usd a month for enough kit to get the job done. Second problem is this is more insecure than hosting at home because it concentrates all these nodes in central points of failure(regulation, outages, attacks, hacks) in datacenters and under a limited  amount of class C subnet ranges. For the bitcoin network to be healthy we want nodes to be located at home and in datacenters.

In all fairness , there is one very useful immediate aspect with Rootstock. It is a useful marketing gimmick to win back some credulous from other projects with clever marketing and buzzwords and increase the value of bitcoin. 
I am sorry, but even though I have a tremendous amount to gain from these deceptive marketing pumps I cannot lie to new users and tell them this has shown any use case worth getting excited for. 
I would love to be proven wrong and invite any to do so by showing me some utility. The only thing that is slightly interesting is a different trust model and higher capacity onchain to supplement bitcoins growth but than again the security is questionable and the 20% tax kills it for me.

A donation to the network would be akin to sending BTC to a burn address. Accumulating BTC certainly is an investment , as no one expects you to never reduce your investment in the future. Hodl does not mean never sell , simply people with long term time preferences instead of short term speculators and daytrading gamblers

purse.io insures against that and I have done over 30 purchases without incident. There are many reasons why people need to buy bitcoins at a 20% premium -- 
As Purse.io gets more popular this discount will drop as competition builds up but right now consumers can really benefit from the fact that there are so many unbanked that get amazonpoints and the unused giftcard market.
But if you are still skeptical , why don't you address the benefit of appreciation for consumers? Bitcoin appreciates 5% or more spend btc , bitcoin dips , spend fiat and wait for a rebound to spend btc and save off everything.

Stable coins are absurd and simply a way for exchanges to profit off of idiots and avoid certain regulations. 
Why use much riskier "stablecoins" when you can just use fiat which is more secure, better accepted, and more stable?
Stable coins are not even a new concept... paypal "coin" , venmo "coin" ... you are just using a trusted third party and not getting all the benefits sometimes like FDIC insurance. With Coinbase and Gemini your fiat is insured up to 250k usd in the US and much more secure and stable than any "stablecoin"

Some misconceptions people have about maximalists-
1) maximalists do not suggest altcoins will cease to exist 
2) many maximalists are perfectly happy to leave Bitcoin if it fails and support another chain 
3) few maximalists suggest that fiat currencies or competing currencies will cease to exist
4) maximalists do not suggest that it is inevitable that Bitcoin will become the dominant currency , simply that it is the most likely project at this time to fulfill this role (just like the USD is at this time). Bitcoin can indeed fail and is indeed an experiment

Cheers. 
TL;DR for those not wanting to watch the video. 
DCA (Dollar Cost Average) is often used by those who lack upfront investment capital and a fine tool to use for this purpose because not investing something is worse than inaction. 
DCA when used as a hedge to simply average out buying high and buying low is foolish strategy if one has the upfront capital and often used with uncertain investors and for emotional reasons. 
DCA is foolish for these reasons:
1) One cannot predict the future short term price of an asset because the intelligentsia of the market will always have more information than any individual or subset of people. The exception to this is in insufficiently liquid markets where you control the market(altcoin developer with majority premine that pumps and dumps) . Thus one should evaluate an investment and make as large a purchase one can do as quickly as possible so the compounded returns with time can be the highest. 
2) Delaying in making an investment means that you will not only be losing 2-3% per year at the best due to inflation but opportunity cost from the compounded returns from the investment over time 
3) DCA is good from the aspect that it trains one to remove emotion from investment but it does so using a crutch that restricts an investor from making wise investments at the right time . One should evaluate an investment logically and make a decisive decision. Whether this calculated risk wins or fails is less important. What is greater importance is you are training your mind to act decisively and without emotional biases and even if you make the wrong bet you will learn from your mistakes and make wiser decisive investment in the future. DCA reinforces indecision and uncertainty which is not what one should train their mind with. 
This does not mean that one should not lack and stable fiat savings. Minimum 3 months, but better a year is recommended. This is critical because not having any buffer will make being a rational investor almost impossible and one needs to have insurance for life's unexpected surprises.

Bitcoin is volatile , but not that volatile. When I go to spend it I rebuy within a minute so this isn't an issue. There is a huge problem with spend and replace though and its UX related. I wish I had a wallet that automated this for me every time I spent. 


If you ever used a merchant processor like bitpay or coinbase you will see that they include tools to allow you to autodump a certain % of BTC for fiat. Some companies like overstock auto save 10-15% of Bitcoin instead of selling it. Companies that use merchant processors like BTCpay tend not to sell because it isn't automated. 
in both these cases the price of Bitcoin would increase with spend and replace . It only is a wash if the company I spend my BTC with autodumps 100% of my BTC. 


buy limit orders alone can be dangerous because in a bull market they may never be filled. This is why I at least cover what I spent with a  market order(In reality I do a simulated market order with coinbase pro to remove any exchange fees = Buy limit order for 1 penny less than market price means it always is filled and I remove fees)

Yes, he can and does program and has a good technical background.


Many core devs believe the SF version of segwit from a coding perspective is "cleaner", so with this definition of clean it is more about aesthetics because there isn't really any added technical debt added that isn't found in a HF. 
segwit as HF is messier for 2 reasons - 
1) Politically it will be a mess with many attacks occuring and 2 chains being created 
2) With a SF only the miners nodes and some wallets need to be upgraded and the transition in upgrading wallets can occur gradually with all old software and code working. With a HF everything needs to be upgraded besides thin clients and all at once which is very messy and difficult to coordinate.

# Release 3.1 - (March 5, 2018)
 * Memory-pool based fee estimation. Dynamic fees can target a desired
   depth in the memory pool. This feature is optional, and ETA-based
   estimates from Bitcoin Core are still available. Note that miners
   could exploit this feature, if they conspired and filled the memory
   pool with expensive transactions that never get mined. However,
   since the Electrum client already trusts an Electrum server with
   fee estimates, activating this feature does not introduce any new
   vulnerability. In addition, the client uses a hard threshold to
   protect itself from servers sending excessive fee estimates. In
   practice, ETA-based estimates have resulted in sticky fees, and
   caused many users to overpay for transactions. Advanced users tend
   to visit (and trust) websites that display memory-pool data in
   order to set their fees.
 * Capital gains: For each outgoing transaction, the difference
   between the acquisition and liquidation prices of outgoing coins is
   displayed in the wallet history. By default, historical exchange
   rates are used to compute acquisition and liquidation prices. These
   values can also be entered manually, in order to match the actual
   price realized by the user. The order of liquidation of coins is
   the natural order defined by the blockchain; this results in
   capital gain values that are invariant to changes in the set of
   addresses that are in the wallet. Any other ordering strategy (such
   as FIFO, LIFO) would result in capital gain values that depend on
   the presence of other addresses in the wallet.
 * Local transactions: Transactions can be saved in the wallet without
   being broadcast. The inputs of local transactions are considered as
   spent, and their change outputs can be re-used in subsequent
   transactions. This can be combined with cold storage, in order to
   create several transactions before broadcasting them. Outgoing
   transactions that have been removed from the memory pool are also
   saved in the wallet, and can be broadcast again.
 * Checkpoints: The initial download of a headers file was replaced
   with hardcoded checkpoints. The wallet uses one checkpoint per
   retargeting period. The headers for a retargeting period are
   downloaded only if transactions need to be verified in this period.
 * The 'privacy' and 'priority' coin selection policies have been
   merged into one. Previously, the 'privacy' policy has been unusable
   because it was was not prioritizing confirmed coins. The new policy
   is similar to 'privacy', except that it de-prioritizes addresses
   that have unconfirmed coins.
 * The 'Send' tab of the Qt GUI displays how transaction fees are
   computed from transaction size.
 * The wallet history can be filtered by time interval.
 * Replace-by-fee is enabled by default. Note that this might cause
   some issues with wallets that do not display RBF transactions until
   they are confirmed.
 * Watching-only wallets and hardware wallets can be encrypted.
 * Semi-automated crash reporting
 * The SSL checkbox option was removed from the GUI.
 * The Trezor T hardware wallet is now supported.
 * BIP84: native segwit p2wpkh scripts for bip39 seeds and hardware
   wallets can now be created when specifying a BIP84 derivation
   path. This is usable with Trezor and Ledger.
 * Windows: the binaries now include ZBar, and QR code scanning should work.
 * The Wallet Import Format (WIF) for private keys that was extended in 3.0
   is changed. Keys in the previous format can be imported, compatibility
   is maintained. Newly exported keys will be serialized as
   "script_type:original_wif_format_key".
 * BIP32 master keys for testnet once again have different version bytes than
   on mainnet. For the mainnet prefixes {x,y,Y,z,Z}|{pub,prv}, the
   corresponding testnet prefixes are   {t,u,U,v,V}|{pub,prv}.
   More details and exact version bytes are specified at:
   
   Note that due to this change, testnet wallet files created with previous
   versions of Electrum must be considered broken, and they need to be
   recreated from seed words.
 * A new version of the Electrum protocol is required by the client
   (version 1.2). Servers using older versions of the protocol will
not be displayed in the GUI.

**12,195 transactions** transactions per block (unlikely we will ever see this reached due to the variety of transactions within a block that are normally included.) Schnorr sigs and MAST can both increase these numbers though

DCA is a fine strategy if you don't already have the fiat upfront to make a large immediate investment. If one had a large windfall or inheritance the wisest strategy  should not be DCA. 
One should immediately set aside a fiat savings account of a year of living expenses and than invest the remaining amount in stocks , bitcoin and other investments as soon as possible.

No need to reject the payment . merchant processors simply warn merchants and customers when pymt is made based upon many variables and than wait to give the all clear sign to merchants. Ideally they will want to support a more secure means of getting instant confirmations like lightning (another problem with bitpay in a long list)


Merchants and merchants processors get at least an email address and have the senders BTC address already , so refunds are not a problem and inputting a separate "refund" address is not needed

2) Bitcoin's volatility is a large negative for currencies importance as being a unit of account but can be leveraged for your advantage. I.E... Buy 1k usd of BTC , BTC appreciates a week later spend BTC or BTC dips a week later than spend fiat instead and wait till BTC appreciates before spending it . This can magnify the savings in item 1 
3) We need to create more liquidity, usage, merchants , and tx velocity thus spending BTC is important. 
4) Some vendors don't immediately sell all their BTC for fiat

Maximalists don't tend to suggest altcoins will dissapear, simply that they will become increasingly irrelevant because using them adds friction, costs, slippage, and risk. The reason why many fiat currencies exist is because this inefficiency is deliberately added to give local control to individual states at a cost. Whether it be loyalty points , local currencies, local fiat ... these will continue to exist and compete with BTC as it grows and eventually overtakes the USD as the reserve currency of trade and perhaps one day becomes the most stable unit of account.

There are many examples for regulatory arbitrage in the most prosperous countries.

You don't seem to understand mining and difficulty. Mining is always profitable for efficient miners regardless the price of Bitcoin.
 &gt;Bitcoin won’t ever exceed USD or become a reserve currency, this is complete fantasy, just like saying the USA will go Bankrupt,
We have no idea what the future holds for Bitcoin. This is an experiment. Also keep in mind that Fiat currencies fail all the time. The USA had 3 currency failures at least in its very brief history. 


There is a feedback loop where as Bitcoin appreciates in value its inflation per USD goes up which stabilizes the price. This alone + a large market cap could lead to a very stable currency in the future without a group of people manipulating interest rates. We don't know if this will work as this is an experiment.

3)Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class, thus it becomes irresponsible not to invest in this. The OP said quite clearly said they are investing in both an roth IRA and 401k at a higher percentage than BTC as well.

What you are saying is True. The average person does not care about privacy or decentralization. They just want something that works and is easy to use. This also means that when traditional fiat doesn't work for them or prevents them from processing a transaction they will move to use solutions like Bitcoin as a means to solve there problem. We have seen this occur many times for many different groups of people (From prostitutes being forced to use Bitcoin because operation chokepoint to Venezuelans buying groceries and medicine. ). This means that Bitcoin will have slow adoption as a currency because certain fiat currencies like USD or EURO work most of the time.
Another characteristic of an average person is greed. If they see Bitcoin keep appreciating in value they will tend to invest and speculate with it . This have multiple consequences, good and bad. The hope that once Bitcoin grows in market-share where it exceeds USD in the future it will be a more stable unit of account and less volatile. If this ever does occur than Bitcoin will be easier to use than fiat for most cases , especially since it is a world currency and not geographically limited like fiat is .

There are many Bitcoin ETFs that have been proposed by different companies. IMHO, none will likely be approved anytime soon by the SEC.
The TL;DR or ELI5 of an ETF is :
A tradeable fund that is backed by secured and regulated Bitcoins which allows institutional funds to invest in Bitcoin indirectly with greater confidence and security.
Many people want an ETF because it will allow for pension funds, brokers, institutional investors , employees with 401Ks, and IRAs to invest in Bitcoin thus driving up the price. The risk with this is the same risk that exists when too much BTC is held by exchanges and banks... they can have undue influence upon Bitcoin if it centralizes in so few hands. This might not be an immediate concern because Bitcoin already is highly decentralized and new entrants holding BTC would simply make it more decentralized but could eventually become a problem if too many early investors sell their BTC to these institutional investors.
There are two funds that essentially do the same thing as an ETF that do not need approval from the SEC and will be allowing institutional investors to indirectly buy BTC (thus driving up the price) :
1) BAKKT = Created by ICE , the parent company of NYSE -

Hard drive capacity is the least of our concerns due to –
Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is ~200+GB for an archival node
Pruned nodes can get down to around ~5GB , and have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it (It actually prunes as it validates)
The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:
1)	Block propagation latency (causing centralization of mining)
2)	UTXO bloat (increases CPU and more RAM costs)
3)	Bandwidth costs 
4)	IBD (Initial Block Download ) Boostrapping new node costs 
5)	Blockchain storage (largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner)
This means we need to scale conservatively and intelligently. We must scale with every means necessary. Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains must be used. 
Bitcoin has gone from a network 7 transactions per second limit and confirmations taking between a second to hours (10 min avg Poisson distribution curve) to ~14 TPS limit onchain and millions of TPS with instant and secure confirmations with LN channels.

In the future this is the type of question to ask in &gt; i scanned the QR-Code from the waiter with my coinbase app
Do not store your Bitcoin in web apps or exchanges. You need to use a personal wallet where you control the private keys. 


Likely another change address controlled by coinbase. When you use an exchange you are trusting them and don't own the BTC but simply have IOU's . After you buy BTC , always immediately withdraw them to your personal wallet where you control them. 


Most wallets (personal or exchange) change the address with every transaction for privacy reasons. This is normal. Just check your coinbase account to see if the BTC has been refunded and if not contact them.


Txs propagate typically in a second or two around the network, but onchain confirmations can take 10 minutes on average(could be 1 second or even an hour as 10 minutes is merely an average). Most merchants use merchant processors that accept 0 confirmation transactions however so you do not have to wait. 


Coinbase batches transactions and thus may delay sending it at times.

The number one way that clients learn about other clients is by connecting to another client and issuing the 'getaddr' command. The standard client has always had that ability. However, there's a problem with this - how do you learn about client 
IRC seeding. This is something that's been in since the first version too. It was simple to implement, but ultimately didn't scale. The first version connected to freenode. Then, bitcoin nodes started getting k-lined. Later versions connected to lfnet. Then, lfnet went down, and IRC support was removed entirely. DNS was around by this point, so that was fine.
IP addresses of well known nodes. This has been in the client since June 2010. Still in the Bitcoin client, though the exact IP addresses change every so often.
DNS seeding. This has been in the client since March 2011. This is easier to scale, because DNS is already built to handle tens of thousands of connections.

Contradicts this-


Not being able to validate your own txs is a degree of centralization. Having a community share resources allows for regulators to focus on these nodes as targets. I am not suggesting we should not have a minimum threshold of requirements. Already many in my community cannot run a full node regardless of money(This is not great but OK). I am suggesting that we shouldn't block out extremely large regions from running a full node. 


I am not talking about simply price , but infrastructure. There are many people in my community that regardless of money cannot run a full node outside of renting a VPS. ... and guess what that is centralizing nodes in specific datacenters users a smaller subset of class c ip ranges.

A sharp shift in node topography leads to problems in the peer to peer consensus layer. Garzik's concerns are unfounded as it sometimes takes years for nodes to transition over to newer versions. We only have seen 90%~ segwit nodes after a year and many versions deployed. There is no problem with btc1 peering with nodes earlier than 0.15 versions. Since NYA supporters are so interested in splitting the network again than we need to start the transition now so both segwit2x altcoin and bitcoin will be better off and waste less resources.

Yes, if mining was more decentralized than this would be a non issue , but if 50-70% of the hashrate was controlled by a few mining pools working in collusion as many suspect than spam to raise the tx fees would be more profitable than the loss of fees to minority mining pools . Keep in mind that if ~60% of the hashrate is working in collusion and decides to spam the network to raise fees they can recapture ~60% of the fees thus paying themselves for such an attack.

Ethereum is a premined scam.
1)	Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense  to the credulous. 
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.

The size of the "ledger" is the least of our problems due to pruning. You can enjoy the full security and privacy of a full node with 5GB of disk space. 


Ok, Gotcha...
we call this IBD (Initial Block Download) or bootstrapping and it is indeed a concern that can discourage more full nodes as pruned wallets still need to download the whole chain and validate all txs before deleting part of the history. 
The solution to this is core devs are getting close to finishing a full node/SPV hybrid that starts in a usable SPV node while the full node syncs in the background. 
Your concerns are indeed valid however and why we are so concerned with increasing the blocksize to quickly.

This is exactly my point. Those that are investing in ETH don't understand that block chains(yes, bitcoin as well) are extremely inefficient protocols and have extremely limited use cases. Having Turing complete scripting language on a block chain can only be justified if you need censorship resistance in running code which is absurd. In what foreseeable future will running code on computers or servers be able to be censored effectively? Those that suggest this don't understand the nature of programming and how censoring code is an impossible task.
The only code thus far or "smart contracts" with any foreseeable future are things such as mutisig, CSV, CLTV , and  HTLCs. Ideally you don't want something that is "turing complete" either as that greatly increases the costs and attack surface

Slippery slope fallacy , right? Well in this case those concerns are valid , especially with the horrible precedent as to how "consensus" was found within NYA. 
In my and many other users cases , there isn't much of a choice, I literally cannot validate 8MB blocks and 4MB averages will be very difficult to maintain due to bandwidth concerns. 


I don't know about this. Some users are so foolish to believe to want to use bitcoin for onchain coffee txs by everyone which is insane. 


But it would not be producing the desired results. I am no longer using peer to peer currency if I have to depend upon a trusted third party. The whole project is an act of pointless supererogation if we cannot use p2p currency. It is also pointless if a mere 17% of companies in the ecosystem  can decide upon new rules without even asking their own clients let alone seeking consensus within the community at large and other developers.

Im am open to hearing your ideas and have my doubts removed. 
The link you just provided I have read and doesn't include any details as to how block chains can help in this case. 
Can you be a bit more specific as to how a "Block Chain" can help against centralized third parties who need to remain centralized as designed? Keep in mind the topic is equifax and not a general conversation of decentralized identity. Securing against equifax breaches would mean you would destroy their complete business model and thus what you are essentially arguing for is equifax not to exist . Is this your position? 
I apologize I am coming off as "closed minding" but there really isn't any easy solution to the problem with equifax as trusted third parties are security vulnerabilities.

f2pool said they walked away so it isn't 95% but lets assume it is for the sake of worst case scenario exploration. 
1) the legacy chain will have extremely slow block times. This isn't a problem because one can still split the coins and easily trade the barrycoins on the chain with 95% hashrate to dump it on an exchange. If anything lack of hashrate is an advantage initially because it makes it almost impossible to dump Bitcoin for barrycoin giving an assymetric advantage to bitcoin
2) We will begin slowly selling off our altcoin bringing hashrate back to the legacy chain due to miner profitability , all we need is a minimum of 15% sustained hashrate to start feeling confident that we can make txs with bitcoin
3) If 15% is not achieved in a few weeks we will of course need to PoW hardfork to an altcoin of our own, which is already ready 
Under no circumstances will I follow segwit2x chain. I will slowly sell off my barrycoins over months like I am doing with my Bcash due to lack of liquidity on exchanges.

Altcoins will continue to have a future. There are two major flaws in peoples reasoning when it comes to altcoins:
1) They can predict the right ones to invest in and know when to exit 
2) They don't fully consider the reality that altcoins tend to pump and dump and new and more interesting ones can quickly replace older ones they have invested in 
Thus investing or holding onto altcoins in the middle of a bear market is a gamble

It may likely be a wise investment , but we shouldn't be recommended people to take loans to buy btc because ...
1) Bitcoin could crash and remain low for 1-3 years at least , or never recover. There is moral hazard in telling people to destroy their finances with gambles. There is no guarantee that bitcoin will keep going up.
2) Even if an investor does well financially , you are encouraging behavior that is reckless and may turn into a full on gambling habit in due time 
It starts with a equity loan ,the rush of quick returns in a bull market ,  than they start daytrading and leveraging on exchanges to feed their habit of the thrill of amazing returns on such short notice. It really isn't health.

In any which case it is more complicated to recover split coins if they don't support it, thus you shouldn't store many of your btc in these wallets (its a mobile wallet , not something that should be done anyways), and if a large split is about to occur you should withdraw your btc to your core full node- advice I would give for all mobile wallets regardless.

This isn't how validation works . 100% of miners can switch to BTC1 and 99% of full nodes will reject them as the protocol is designed.

There are already more altcoin spinoffs than this technically . 5 UTXO spinoffs and in Nov perhaps 2 more if they decide to split mid NOV. 


This would only occur if a minority chain didn't get at least 15% hashrate after a few weeks of dumping their segwit2x altcoins. 


That is a very wise trading strategy, regardless what you want to invest in post November , going 100% in BTC before the split means more of an airdrop and the cumulative value post split is always higher from what we have seen.

Perhaps another means to objectively secure a blockchain will surface that is better, but a big part of the misunderstanding is that people don't seem to understand that the work and expense in PoW is what objectively secures the network. The security mechanism must be objectively measurable and trustlessly measurable. It must be easy to validate and granular in adjusting. It must also be simple enough for competition to enter the ecosystem and disrupt. This is no small feat, and automatically will make other provable work solutions like proof of hard disk space to be less ideal. When PoS proponents attack the cost or waste of Pow it reflects a deep misunderstanding of what is trying to be accomplished here.


To clarify , its not the amount of electricity/ASICs used but the cost of such resources that correlated with price of BTC. This subtle distinction is important because it means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

txs fees for many txs with Bitcoin are extremely low .
Some wallets allow you to set the fee per category like economy , normal , fast at different fee rates
Others allow the above but also allow you to manually type in the exact fee to get much cheaper rates . Thus checking here  tells you on average how many blocks to get your first confirmation .
You send a tx , it shows instantly , but it is unconfirmed until included in a block.
Thus by manually setting the fee you can see that its fine to wait 2 blocks at 10-20 sats per byte , thus avg tx size 226 bytes x 10 sats = 2260 satoshis tx fee or 11 cents instead of a couple dollars other wallets might charge you due not being as precise with the fee market
If you are dealing with small amounts it is critical that you control the amount of the fee manually so you aren't overcharged. Therefore you need to use airbitz or green address that allow this. Trezor/ledger/core allow this too. study this page - 
If you are paying high fees in bitcoin right now it means you are using a wallet that guesses the fee wrong and just need to switch wallets.
Also keep in mind that txs fees are priced in bitcoins and not USD , therefore when bitcoin is very valuable the fees can go up as well.
just keep in mind tx vary in size and some can be 400-600 bytes , but that simply means 22-60 cents to get it in within 1-2 blocks.
Added bonus If you move your btc to a segwit address with the ledger, trezor or armory wallets , you can get fees up to half the above as well!

2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.

No central planners here. I'm counting ~25% of blocks that have plenty of free space for txs. Remember even if blocks are 100 MB in size than a confirmation can still take over an hour to occur regardless of how much money is paid as a tx fee. This is the nature of the poisson distribution of blocks. Bitcoin was always a settlement system where 0conf tx take time to settle to the chain. I use bitcoin daily and have never had an issue of even waiting 2 blocks for a confirmation. All my txs immediately get in the next block for extremely cheap fees ranging from 5-10 pennies which means that their are plenty of users purposely and manually setting lower fees of a couple pennies referencing back to my original point.

I see a lot of misleading propaganda which assumes maximalists or those who suggest Hodl should never spend or use their BTC. Hodl is simply the confidence one has in themselves and their community where we have long term time preferences and will insure we see this project succeed through effort. Part of this effort is on supporting the price which indirectly pays for security and encourages more trust in Bitcoin. This is merely one important task among many that we have to work towards.  
The reality is what is suggested is Spend and replace. I use Bitcoin almost daily but always replace it and buy back more each time.

I'll have to agree with Peter here, I like the idea with multiple implementations in principle but not when it comes to the consensus or peer to peer layers.

You never know which is the winning chain or losing one before hand as hashpower follows profits. What can me the most cumulative worked chain can quickly reverse and bitcoin is also defined but what is **VALID** and not simply most worked.

People can hard fork whenever they want if they want new rules. I can't stop , nor want to prevent their ability to do so and this has little impact on what values I have with the rules I enforce. 


CB or xthin don't work under byzantine conditions. Validating txs must work, especially under attack scenarios . Thus you should use the calculator -

I know over 20 of them personally. Why would it be weird that a bunch of cipherpunks , anarchists and libertarians want privacy, especially when it comes to their wealth stored in  BTC? What would be extremely stupid and odd is if many of these BTC millionaires openly disclosed their wealth to tax authorities or the public.


This would be the exact same scenario if all the millionaires in the US instantly sold their USD fiat for BTC or another currency in the forex exchange. In fact because Fiat and traditional millionares assets are highly leveraged it would be far worse and would only take a small percentage of these millionaires cashing out their fiat to drive the USD to the ground.

It takes years for even intelligent and competent programmers to begin to get up to speed with working on core. Bitcoin also requires a broad range of background knowledge to grasp a basic understanding and this really limits who can work on it effectively.

The people who have the most bitcoins and are mostly opposed to segwit2x are the exact people who can patiently wait a couple weeks while we dump our Barrycoins. We are conservative due to are large amounts of bitcoins and treat bitcoin as digital gold first and foremost.

Bitcoin should not have governance. What you suggest is a weakness is aits strength and proves it is decentralized unlike Ethereum

Bitcoin doesn't have a centralized coherent marketing budget created by a team that just fundraised with a premined ICO to make a fancy website to brainwash users into thinking they are the next big thing .

Slippery slope fallacy , right? Well in this case those concerns are valid , especially with the horrible precedent as to how "consensus" was found within NYA. 
In my and many other users cases , there isn't much of a choice, I literally cannot validate 8MB blocks and 4MB averages will be very difficult to maintain due to bandwidth concerns. 


I don't know about this. Some users are so foolish to believe to want to use bitcoin for onchain coffee txs by everyone which is insane. 


But it would not be producing the desired results. I am no longer using peer to peer currency if I have to depend upon a trusted third party. The whole project is an act of pointless supererogation if we cannot use p2p currency. It is also pointless if a mere 17% of companies in the ecosystem  can decide upon new rules without even asking their own clients let alone seeking consensus within the community at large and other developers.

If segwit2x fails before split mid nov than btc will likely rally due to uncertainty removed and network effect preserved . 
If split proceeds than the cumulative value post split will likely be higher (as we have seen in all past splits BTC/BCH and ETH/ETC) at the cost of moral hazard /volatility/ market confusion/ and loss of network effect..... but to an investor they have more value short term.

Just look at what Coinbase did during all the previous splits. Of the 8 previous splits they only payed out 1 (ETC) and are still pending paying out the second one (BCH). This means you will need to wait till early 2018 for coinbase to give you your BCH because you made the mistake of leaving btc on exchanges . In the interim the value of Bcash will continue to drop as we have seen during the last 2 months . Thus Coinbase's laggard response is costing you value and opportunity costs. What makes this worse is the more BTc you have the more BTG and B2X you can claim so they are costing you even more opportunity costs to profit
Sorry for sounding like a broken record.
**Never Store your Bitcoins on exchanges or web wallets!**
I recommend electrum , a hardware wallet (ledger/trezor/digital bitbox) or core.
There are so many risks when you don't treat bitcoin like p2pcash and control the private keys , splits or no split

Sharding is being discussed but might not be necessary with bitcoin due to the fact that you don't need that many archival nodes with the whole history to bootstrap from and bootstrapping nodes can peer with other nodes bootstrapping as well during this process.

make sure your wallet allows you to set manual fees 
Segwit fees are 30-60% less than shown here :
I am paying 5 - 10 sats per byte per tx . Dirt cheap. 


Than they should be working with one of the 5 LN implementations not pursuing a HF. Payment channels solve all their concerns and much more. Onchain scaling increases their support costs because tx finality is unknown due to the Poisson process .  


they have had since May since they signed the NYA . If they were so concerned about capacity and fees they would have implemented it thus far. They are hypocrites.

I understand you want to to help . I understand identity theft is a large problem. I am just explaining to you I cannot see any hypothetical use case that could solve the problem you are presenting with the use of block chains.
Perhaps you can elaborate as to how a block chain can help?
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:33:57
Hash rate dominated can quickly change. Cumulative hashrate as well. The original chain is the one we have right now as SF's do not create altcoins. If a PoW change happens than that would be an altcoin. There would than be 3 altcoins and the original chain with extremely slow blocks and fairly insecure.  
Whats even more interesting is if the segwit2x maintains a majority of the hash rate between the 4 splits using same SHA256 it will have little development from core or any of the LN teams. This means that they will keep trying to copy the work from more talented devs but the codebases may start to diverge due to the fact that it will be likely changes will be made to the chain with most development that is more difficult to remove without introducing bugs as most of the development will focus on the new PoW chain which would have a much different algo. 
The more you play out the game theory the more likely segwit2x just falls apart based upon the circumstances.

there are other , better means of increasing tx throughput than increasing the blocksize= MAST , Schnorr sigs , payment channels.

What an idiot, hasn't he heard of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:34:16


IMHO- 
Here is some more nuanced opinions as well. and why I am buying as much as I can before November:
There might be another HF split in mid NOV. We have see splits occur before (notably ETH/ETC and BTC/BCH)
In all cases the cumulative value of both tokens was higher after the split. This is because daytraders love volatility and fresh fiat comes in and those supporting each side buy more.
This isn't free money though as there is a cost in market confusion, higher volatility , new users being harmed, brand dilution, moral hazard, more support, ect...
Thus it is my opinion it is silly as an investor to sell any bitcoin before mid November because
A) The HF split never happens - market rallies due to network effect being preserved and uncertainty being removed
B) Split happens , all the negative effects above but your cumulative value is temporarily higher
Thus I am still buying as much btc as possible every week and not spending anything
This would be a contentious HF if it happened because consensus isn't there in the users therefore if it occurs there is a guarantee split that will occur. It is theoretically possible to HF (hard fork ) without a split but difficult.

NYA signers primarily have an obligation to their clients and shareholders and Barry misrepresented to the group how much support such a Hf did have and would have due to his lack of understanding of how consensus is formed in bitcoin and misjudging the community. 
It is thus entirely justified and ethical that companies walk away from the NYA to support their primary obligation that supersedes everything else = shareholders and customers. They can make this easy for themselves if they simply informed their customers honestly what the HF means and the associated risks and benefits and asked for their feedback.
 If not an overwhelming amount of their customers supported the HF they should walk away from it.

Lack of replay protection doesn't prevent you from splitting coins. Also no txs are needed to split coins as well


Depends upon the light client . some will not follow segwit2x , some give users a choice , and others will trick users into new rules without consent 


Even Bcash occasionally dips to 1.3% of total hashrate at times... but i wouldn't want to make larger txs unless I was on a chain with at least 15% of total hashrate


That won't likely be necessary. It would be extremely unlikely for the minority chain to remain below 15% for over a couple weeks. If Anything I see the opposite occurring with the legacy chain winning most the hashrate back after we split and dump/


This I agree with .
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:48:12


There is no way to heal this division . Core does not dictate what software I choose to run. There is absolutely no way I will accept a dangerous and uninteresting HF like BTC1 even if 100% of devs support it.

Personally , I would buy before Oct 25th in case BTG Bgold is worth anything.
the cumulative value of both coins post split has always been higher. Therefore if you are concerned than just buy bitcoin , wait for the split , split your coins after Nov 18th , and wait before selling either one . Or simply wait till after Nov 18th(late Nov) to buy bitcoin.
The reason why the cumulative value increases short term is because speculators and day traders love high liquid volatility and both sides shore up their coin in a speculation war

The blocksize avg space allowed is doubled with segwit and limit increase by 4x.


This isn't about the devs alone as there are many non core devs who would not follow segwit2x even if 100% of core supported it . All that would happen is  core devs would lose credibility for supporting something dangerous and unnecessary. 


Volunteers can work on any project they want.... and Bitcoin ceases to be interesting if it can be so easily manipulated by 20% of businesses and without wide consensus. Good for them to want to support a version of bitcoin that is secure against these forms of attacks.

We? These companies didn't even bother asking their customers and only represent 17% of the ecosystem.


The majority doesn't support it and their is no way it will kill off B Cash , Alts don't die , XPY and paycoin still exists. 


B cash exists for asicboost and because a certain part of the community hates core and wants to fire core. Many of them hate segwit as well. Few of them are coming back even if we get everyone on board with the joke that is segwit2x 


Game theory suggests there is a better chance it does not happen 


Even if 100% of core and reddit gets on board with segwit2x right now (never going to happen) there will be a split and people will lose money. This is due to the nature of people being slow to upgrade. 2 months is impossible. 


We obviously don't need it , blocks aren't full and many NYA companies aren't even bothering using the extra capacity segwit allows. 


28 TPS average with segwit2x cannot take care of amazon alone .

More complicated than this unfortunately -
4-5 TPS was the avg , but 7 TPS was peak for 10 min block times , but with quicker confirmations we sometimes saw over 9TPS with a 1MB blocksize limit pre segwit 
With segwits 4MB weight limit , this would average ~2MB blocks with 90 % segwit adoption or 8-10 TPS avg and 14or higher TPS peak (but remember 2MB was the avg with wide adoption and blocks can be even larger so it is possible to see over 20 TPS)
... but it is even more complicated than this as there exists tx batching which allows many more "transactions" than you see charted
Add to this lightning network being used on mainet which allows millions of txs per second right now with the most rudimentary solved routing

This is false as segwit is a blocksize increase.


Core has no authority. The software doesn't self update and every individual has a right to run any software and enforce any rules they want without devs permission. 


This already exists. There are many different dev teams and implementations from knots , btcd, bcoin, bitcore, libbitcoin, ect who all cooperate and influence each other 


According to Jihan, this is exactly what they are trying to do, which is ridiculous as core devs will continue to work on our version of bitcoin without the existing miners if needs be. There is almost no chance any of the existing core devs will ever work on btc1

Yes a fixed disinflationary supply. 
This is only monetary disinflation. How currencies act economically in the market is a matter of supply and demand . Right now bitcoin is economically inflationary.


You would need to go back many years for USD to be economically deflationary. It typically has economic inflation of 2-3% and that is because the whole world buys it due to its reserve currency status in many countries otherwise inflation would be much higher.

Since she rarely does porn now(only private videos for wealthy fans) her demographic has shifted more towards sport fans so these pictures will probably be promoting Bitcoin to the sport demo more than arab demo these days

I respect the consistent content you produce and effort you place but it certainly isn't fair to hide behind the fact that your aren't journalists as an excuse not to be more skeptical and ask slightly better questions. From the questions you do ask you do indeed do some research into your guests so its not a time issue, but more of an issue you are going out of your way to be "nice" and be "open minded" and not assume the worse. You don't even have to be an expert either and I see this is an excuse because its trivial to do a keyword search for accusations and flaws that these "projects" have and glean from them before an interview. Not being fluent in the manner or specialized will only sometimes allow the guest to slip out of the question in reply but at least you asked the difficult question and anyone watching who is familiar can quickly determine if the guest is a charlatan or not.

So I think you are asking how to buy BTC and not get a wallet
1) Ask your parents or another adult to help you. Most parents are reasonable if you come to them and say you want to work part time , make a budget , and save some fiat currency, invest in a IRA/stocks , and Buy some Bitcoin to make money for college or a future business.
2) Coinatmradar.com - If you have a cellphone , many atm's will allow you to buy with sms verification instead of ID verification (7-15% premium)

Here is a securities lawyer explaining how EOS and ETh are illegal securities with regards to the Howey test- 
This was further reinforced at the senate hearing with the SEC who confirmed all ICOs were illegal securities -
The location of the foundation has no bearing on whether or not the SEC fines the foundation or takes other legal action . What matters is if either 1 person in the US purchased the illegal security and / or if ETh was ever marketed in the US by Vitalik or eth foundation (It was , heavily)
Yes, I think the SEC will eventually heavily fine the ETh foundation and EOS like they did with ripple.

Visa averages around 1,700 TPS, what you are citing is peak numbers sometimes seen. 
Most Bitcoin txs occur offchain(exchanges, web wallets, liquid and lightning) so that 5-7 number is wrong. Also there is batching(1 tx can represent hundreds of txs) onchain and segwit doubled the average capacity limits as well so I am afraid you have been misled. I know I and many others were buying BTC from coinbase and than purchasing items from amazon with purse.io by going directly from coinbase to purse and eliminating the onchain fee especially during the last appreciation bubble to avoid the higher onchain tx fees.
Your statements are also a bit misleading as tx throughput doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the % of currency usage going up during rapid deflation either. 
The most you could suggest is due to Bitcoins relatively low liquidity and only 2 major depreciation bubbles where enough merchant processors could confirm an uptick in usage during these bubbles we simply lack enough data points to draw a conclusion. 
Thus at most one would suggest that the current evidence should make one skeptical about any economist spreading fear concerning "deflationary death spirals" and we will see in the future if these economists are in time further proven wrong

This is a good chart for investing and speculating in Bitcoin but there are some exceptions:
1) If you have low interest credit card debt or mortgage debt it still might be wise to invest in Bitcoin. Any high interest debt should be paid off first before investing in anything from stocks, bonds, Bitcoin
2) Investing and speculating is different from using/spending and replacing. Someone in debt would be wise using bitcoin to save 15% off amazon with a budget to get out of debt with services like purse.io, or many other companies that offer discounts with bitcoin
3) Bitcoin involves a lot more than just speculating and investing and most people should be learning about it and the technology that underpins it. Testnet wallets and faucets allow people to test bitcoin as well.

segwit2x is far from consensus though and yes , even if it did have  a "super majority", it would be legally problematic for exchanges to list an altcoin as bitcoin unless everyone followed the HF. 
Here is the current breakdown -
1) Over 99% of full nodes users are not agreeing with segwit2x or btc1
These 110k full nodes will all automatically ban and reject btc1 (segwit2x ) nodes mid November if segwit2 activates.
2) 99% of developers oppose segwit2x and will not develop on that chain no matter what.
3) Only 17% of companies agree to segwit2x (down from 21%) , 17% of companies oppose segwit2x , and 83% of companies did not agree to it.
Of the companies that agreed to segwit2x , they didn't even bother asking their customers and evidence exists that many of their clients oppose segwit2x
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:13:37
I suppose the things left to fix mainly have to deal with GUI UX. 0.15 has a great fee estimator but users still are waiting on wallets that perform automatic fee bumping via RBF. 
I imagine a UX where a max fee per category can be set and than Users selecting from several predefined tx fees groups like economy, normal, and expedited makes for far better UX. The wallet could automatically bump the fee to attempt to get in a desired time window with RBF
Right now users having to go to this 
and do the math and estimates for every tx is a big burden.

Before announcing it they make a release which will only be valid on S2x by virtue of being nearly 1MB in size.
The big s2x release transaction will require a fairly high total transaction fee due to size... but it's not like exchanges are free. It's comparable to exchange fees if the amount traded is over about $10k.

BIP91 activated segwit , not segwit2x/btc1
Even if we incorrectly assume your comment is factual , it is impossible to enforce subsequent changes with prior ones and signalling for "NYA" means little and carries less of an importance or risk than spinning up sybil nodes and EC2 or wearing a funny hat on twitter. Example - f2pool has indicated withdrawal from NYA but still signals it because the owner said he wasn't going to bother changing the signal until next reboot of his nodes .

**Bitcoin (BTC)** -
99% of developer/specialist support
Far more hashrate - 
Larger community of users
99% of merchant support
Far less mining centralization
Far more node decentralization
Most devs Road map is for conservative scaling and focus on security , privacy and fungibility.
Current capacity allowance is 14 TPS (transactions per second) average with most txs using segwit and millions of txs per second for LN payment channels (used right now but awaiting GUI development finished for widespread use)
**B Cash (BCH)**
One of 5 altcoin spinoffs from Bitcoin
Roadmap is focusing on cheap tx fees and many hard forks for larger capacity blocks at the risk of decentralization and security.
Currently doesn't have transaction malleability fixed so is stuck with a mere 56TPS max throughput. Their focus is primarily on onchain scaling but do open the possibility up for L2.
Is still vulnerable to this PoW vulnerability -  which is largely neutralized in bitcoin with segwit
Still has not balanced UTXO costs and no plans to do so.

whether or not this is a wise fundraising method is an entirely different topic altogether and nothing directly to do with the design of ethereum. You can fundraiser ICOs with  Bitcoin , and ethereum is principally targeted simply because it had a larger base of credulous investors that would not attack their scams and warn people as quickly. 


What efficiency is there to be found if no censorship risk exists in running code? Why write a Dapp if it can never scale or compete with code running on a server?


It is not a desirable feature to have programmable money using "turing complete" language which just introduces a much  larger attack surface. Bitcoin was  built  with a scripting language from day one and many of us are  still amused why anyone would want a "turing complete" currency as anyone with experience in programming and security knows this is very foolish.

Also one of the main value proposition and why Bitcoin was created was for digital scarcity, thus jumping from one altcoin to another with instamines and massive premines undermines this. 
Also most are not proof of work. PoS and other variants is not very interesting and are insecure. 
Many of the people most skeptical about blockchains are programmers , pen testers and engineers who understand the tech they are developing and testing. Those that simply promise everything and not realistic with the limitations of this technology should be regarded as snake oil salesmen, not to be trusted. The problem is many people unfamiliar with the technology are incapable of understanding the marketing word salad being sold to them and rather than understanding the technology which underpins what they are promoting are simply repeating misleading or false propaganda.
Most people I speak to still have no idea why "blocks" in block chains exist and how that relates specifically to PoW and why many companies are switching to the term DLT because of embarrassment when they realize those of us that are technically capable know how absurd it is to deliberately include unnecessary latency by batching transactions into "blocks"

Have them suggest they will get paid slightly more under the table if they pay their own caja, and than demand they show the receipts they are actually paying the caja monthly. They will pay under 40 usd a month and have just as good coverage if you paid the much higher fee . The reasons caja costs so much when employers pay it is 2 fold :
1) It also covers their retirement , like social security in the US
2) Costa rica price gouges employers because they can 
As long as they have health insurance (but you have to verify as many will stop paying) than most of the concerns are removed. I still advise being 100% legal but the above is the minimum that should be followed

You need to qualify your statements. Most people are using BTC as an investment or speculating , but many people are using BTC as a currency as well; services like purse.io are extremely popular. I for one pay employees in BTC, tip people in BTC , and buy things daily. 


The evidence for this is not only lacking but reflecting the opposite thus far as I have shown
Are you aware that fiat currencies like USD, euro, and yuan  because their reserve status are also treated as investment hedges where they are saved by many countries instead of gold? You might argue about the definition of "investment" but the bottom line is they save large amounts of fiat to insure they are secure in the future just like many people do with BTC

Many lawyers and individuals would disagree with this. There is moral hazard and market manipulation when you replace the BTC ticker with an an altcoin you fraudulently call bitcoin.

As long as Bitcoin's volatility is low enough (hopefully due to a very large liquidity in the future) credit is very simple to issue.

Ok, I understand, you are suggesting that the paper you cited gives the rationalizations for a target between  2-4% inflation but also argues why they are flawed. I agree, the arguments I have read are severely lacking and inflation is principally desired for a whole list of other reasons not explained in this paper.

Employers secretly know that bitcoin is more likely to appreciate and thus will never lock in a contract in BTC if they have any common sense. Thus his sentiment doesn't even come into the equation because there is no chance they will denominate the payout amount in BTC within the contract. Gold would be more reasonable
Perhaps in 20-50 years Bitcoin will be less volatile and only slightly appreciating in value like gold against fiat , but that day is not here yet
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:50:01


Deflation can be bad in certain situations and context, but some of their assumptions about deflation in itself have thus far shown to be incorrect as we have seen in Bitcoin. This doesn't mean everything they suggest is flawed, my opinion is we have a lot to learn from many schools of economics. I am not just some austrian school mises fan , but actually have more of an affinity to EMH theory.


All it takes is a single unexplained data point to cast doubt on an underlying economic theory, which I have provided , and even you provided with that initial paper. 


No, the paper specifically suggests a target of 0 is desirable. Inflation being slightly above that target or below may have subtle tradeoffs that is  not adequately explored in that paper however. Any research papers that studies the negative effects of fiat and deflation are not properly isolating out the effects of deflation in itself. Deflation in itself can be a symptom of a larger problem like stagflation where a deflationary monetary policy can lead to more short term pain. 
IMHO mild inflation isn't necessarily a undesirable outcome either, as I believe that the greater focus is on predictability and stability where contracts can be made and a currency maintains a stable unit of account . This means that Bitcoin , albeit having some qualities that make it superior to fiat , fails in one of the more important aspects due to its volatility. Thus Bitcoin , at least for the time being is principally used as a currency insomuch as friction is introduced in fiat via censorship or for moral reasons.

Most of bitcoins value still comes from speculation but yes, there is a growing market of inelastic demand from a circular economy of users who need bitcoin to survive. 
Unfortunately, Bitcoin hasn't eaten much market share from the US dollar with arms trading and terrorism but it has been slowly eating away market share in these categories:
Drugs, gambling, prostitution, ransomeware, money laundering , capital flight.
This makes bitcoin somewhat of a blackmarket ETF where state governments heavily subsidize the value and premium of bitcoin by introducing regulation and laws which make bitcoin a valuable tool to route around these restrictions. 
Therefore the best way to destroy much of the value of bitcoin is to make everything legalized and for all governments to become anarchistic. Thus Bitcoin is a hedge against anarchy and if you think governments and laws will continue to exist bitcoin has a bright future ahead.

The larger issue is consistency . Multicoiners are essentially treating their tokens as penny stocks and supporting hyper inflation like we see with fiat... which is fine if that is what they want.

The market has already spoken with Bcash (BCH) continuing to lose value against bitcoin ( btc ) but....
You will not get a non biased perspective from anyone regarding BCH and BTC . I am biased towards bitcoin so keep that in mind as I explain to you the differences - 
**Bitcoin (BTC)** -
99% of developer/specialist support
Far more hashrate - 
Larger community of users
99% of merchant support
Far less mining centralization
Far more node decentralization
Most devs Road map is for conservative scaling and focus on security , privacy and fungibility.
Current capacity allowance is 14 TPS (transactions per second) average with most txs using segwit and millions of txs per second for LN payment channels (used right now but awaiting GUI development finished for widespread use)
LN wallets we are testing right now -
**B Cash (BCH)**
One of 7 altcoin spinoffs from Bitcoin
Roadmap is focusing on cheap tx fees and many hard forks for larger capacity blocks at the risk of centralization and lower security.
Currently doesn't have transaction malleability fixed so is stuck with a mere 56TPS max throughput. Their focus is primarily on onchain scaling but do open the possibility up for L2.
Is still vulnerable to this PoW vulnerability -  which is largely neutralized in bitcoin with segwit
Still has not balanced UTXO costs and no plans to do so.

This is a fair concern. The general thought is that Bitcoin is going through these stages -
Collectible &gt; Speculative investment &gt; Long term Store of Value &gt;  Currency &gt; Unit of account 
Very stable forms of currency like USD or Euros that have a large percentage of dominance as reserve currencies worldwide are units of accounts because their lack of volatility
We are hoping that most of Bitcoin's volatility disappears with a much larger market cap / more liquidity. While we are headed in the right direction thus far with slowly becoming less volatile as liquidity increases , we have to be honest with ourselves that we are still testing the effects of a disinflationary currency with a controlled fixed supply. 
If Bitcoin fails as a unit account in time than it doesn't mean that the project is a total failure either because it could still be a great store of value(digital gold) , MoWT (Method of wealth transport = capital flight) , MoE (Medium of exchange for censored transactions) , and Timestamping and smart contract platform. 
Of course we are hopping it also becomes a day to day currency. 
Here is how you can help matters with your DCA investing = 
Thus if you get paid twice a month than what you should do is buy some Bitcoin immediately twice a month and also in addition set buy limit orders on an exchange for 5-10% below spot price. If those orders do not get filled by  the following paycheck than buy your set amount and reset the buy limit orders for 5-10% below spot price from the current market price.
The reason for this is 2 fold:
1)	you can auto pickup savings with BTC volatility on the dips which is psychologically rewarding
2)	If a large amount of people create large amounts of Buy limit support than BTC becomes more stable unit of account and more liquid leading to more investor confidence and making BTC more of a currency(less volatility = better unit of account) and thus increases the likelihood your investment will continue appreciating in value.
 shows buy support that makes Bitcoin less volatile
Until Bitcoin becomes a great unit of account than BTC wallets will simply have to show the local fiat currency besides the BTC amount for usability and merchants use a shopping cart that shows both values updated iin real time which isn't a big deal.

If the utility needs to build infrastructure specifically for the miner , sure, but electrical costs supposedly cover the cost of the infrastructure and if miners use the same exact infrastructure as consumers because they rent existing commercial space than why would they need to shoulder the burden more?


that is the root of the problem, fixing the market , and not allowing floating rates and market forces. 


Why? If consumer demand increases to such a degree they should want the miners to leave and seek cheaper rates elsewhere

There is no guarantee Bitcoin will return 100% , thus it may make better sense to pay off that  credit card debt with 7% interest during a BTC bear market and than start to invest a year later .

An ad hominem fallacy is when one simply makes personal attacks without supporting evidence unlike what I am doing.
In the link I give out a very detailed explanation with further links showing evidence and reasoning why ethereum is a scam.
There are many contributing reasons why ethereum is a scam , but the crux of the problem rests in the reality that there is no censorship risk in code execution thus the whole project rests on tricking the credulous into believing there is any underlying efficiency to be found in a "turing complete" blockchain

I suppose Occam's razor would make cash the logical choice being that is how we normally did it , and we typically took extensive steps to hide where it was mailing from back than as well when registering domains. Satoshi being one of the most searched for person by admirers, governments, charlatans, and journalists means that it is very unlikely he would make such a sloppy mistake being that it has been over 10 years and no one has any clue who he is. 


Some of us get slightly annoyed by those researching his identity because it might be dangerous for Bitcoin at least from certain attack vectors as we have already seen from the cult of CSW.

More details of how you can measure it found here - [
Here is some basic math .
Presegwit is 1MB is the equivalent of 1,048,576 bytes.
166 bytes for the minimum-sized Bitcoin transaction
maximum rate is thus 10TPS even without variance increasing this number higher(10TPS assumes 10 minute block averages and often blocks are found sooner thus the maximum is over 10TPS with variance)
More typical txsize is 180 bytes inputs + 40bytes outputs + 50 bytes overhead=270 bytes
1,048,576 bytes/270 = 3883.6/600= 6.47 TPS

I am suggesting there are many schools of economics who tend to disagree with each other, even your own cited article disagrees with the IMF one that inflation is a desired target.

There is a long history of different unique attack vectors for each wallet. As a general rule - exchange/web wallet &lt; desktop SPV &lt; mobile SPV &lt; mobile SPV + personal full node &lt; HW wallet &lt; HW wallet + personal full node &lt; SSS/multisig cold storage or multisig of HW wallets with personal full node 
There are all sorts of exceptions to this and nuances as well. Blaming electrum for being an advanced and feature rich wallet that new users would ignorantly use incorrectly is not addressing the root of the problem. It would be much more dangerous to suggest luddites to try and secure their BTC with the glacier protocol - glacierprotocol.org which is one of the most secure ways to store your BTC. What you are saying is that perhaps electrum isn't the first wallet new users should use until they learn more.
Suggesting electrum is the "most hackable wallet ever" when many people use it properly to secure billions of dollars of BTC is misguided to say the least. It isn't even the most targeted wallet to attempt to exploit right now if you are in the opsec community and watching the scams occur.

This sounds great on the surface but we must consider that "Banks" are given an asymmetric advantage in lending due to the nature of fractional reserve currency and the discount rates from the fed. 
If the principle currency was mildly deflationary (0-2%) and not give any special privileges to banks, private individuals could choose to either save up for starting their Business or realty investment or seek better rates from private individuals or companies competing for loans. Perhaps people would be able to not be forced to pay double the price of their home with 30 year mortgages in a more competitive market?

Exchanges should wait for 20 or more confirmations with that low hashpower. Scary low at ~1% total hashrate . Anything below 15% is frighting and the only reason BCH gets away with this in past is because the miners hashing Bcash  control more ~50% of bitcoins hashrate as well. 1% means that over 10 different pools not partnered or sympathetic with bitmain can attack BCH.

I as well and am an agorist. 


I agree we are past the point that Bitcoin can be stopped, the point I am trying to make is some forms of marketing do more harm than good and this is a perfect case. Try and empathize with a non - bitcoin user/average person or congressman for instance. What do you think their reaction is when they see this graffiti?
Perhaps your logic is "there is no such thing as bad publicity" , but this isn't technically true and usually a policy for someone that has a very specific target demographic like a rock and roll band or pop star. Bitcoin doesn't have a specific target demographic and is trying to find mainstream adoption.
I am not even opposed to graffiti as an art form either and would love seeing someone  graffiti on property they own. US fiat is not property we own , but is owned by the federal reserve. Whatever happened to respect for property rights? We don't need to steal or damage other peoples property to be successful. Bitcoin is good enough to survive and become dominant without this.

99% of them are scams , pump and dump memes , or pointless projects that don't solve real problems
Also one of the main value proposition and why Bitcoin was created was for digital scarcity, thus jumping from one altcoin to another with instamines and massive premines undermines this.
Also we want are humble to how high the stakes are and how much work that needs to be done , so we would rather focus on one project than be distracted by many. 
Also most are not proof of work. PoS and other variants is not very interesting and are insecure.
Many of the people most skeptical about blockchains are programmers , pen testers and engineers who understand the tech they are developing and testing. Those that simply promise everything and not realistic with the limitations of this technology should be regarded as snake oil salesmen, not to be trusted. The problem is many people unfamiliar with the technology are incapable of understanding the marketing word salad being sold to them and rather than understanding the technology which underpins what they are promoting are simply repeating misleading or false propaganda.
Most people I speak to still have no idea why "blocks" in block chains exist and how that relates specifically to PoW and why many companies are switching to the term DLT because of embarrassment when they realize those of us that are technically capable know how absurd it is to deliberately include unnecessary latency by batching transactions into "blocks"

This has yet to be shown , but for the sake of discussion lets assume that one day this is the case where courts acknowledge smart contracts in any way. 
Why would you need the ethereum blockchain executing these DAPPs or smart contracts when you can simply execute the code on the participants computers or servers participating in such contract and skip the ethereum fuel tax? In such a hypothetical scenario where the smart contracts have any legal enforceable, wouldn't the logical step be between the courts server and the participants computers? 
Otherwise if you are discussing a scenario where the enforcement of the contract is tied up in a simple bond of some cryptocurrency being lost with a multisig than why would you need the ethereum blockchain executing these DAPPs or smart contracts when you can simply execute the code on the participants computers or servers participating in such contract and skip the ethereum fuel tax? You simply do not need a full "turing complete" blockchain to carry out a multisig contract where the multisig is censorship resistant and the more complex code is carried out on individual computers enforced with a HLTC
If you still don't understand , please provide a specific example of a hypothetical smart contract you want to discuss in more detail.

This would need to be calculated based upon fractional reserve debt and central bank loans + quantitative easing - destruction of older currency and other variables... but is pointless to do  since fiat is slightly inflationary it typically is not used as much as an investment so % wise isn't saved to as high of a degree with the exception of reserve currencies like USD, euro, and yuan where many countries actually do hedge with them as savings making calculating the divergence between economic inflation and monetary inflation more complicated but it can be done. With Bitcoin calculating monetary inflation is trivial because of the planned controlled supply , and calculating economic inflation is simply a result of the markets trading pairs correlated with a basket of goods and services with measurements like the CPI

Many maximalists I know typically categorize coins in these categories:
1) Legit coin with promising future but still experimental and might fail but has the best chance of success = Bitcoin 
2) Not a scam, interesting project and development but not worth investing in outside of following development = monero, grin (or other Mimblewimble projects)
3) Not a scam(but might include some dishonest elements) but pointless project that has no future and not worth buying or following = litecoin,namecoin, etc...
4) Scam , but not a shitcoin because enough people are fooled by dishonest marketing = ripple, ethereum 
5) Shitcoins = low value and pointless scams = 99% of alts

These can be run very easily on a server or computer you set up unless you are foolish enough to block your own attempts to run this malware by installing antivirus software. 


This can easily be bypassed and are you aware that there are open source distros? Are you aware that most servers  run open source OSs where you have complete control over what code executes?


Bitcoin is indeed inefficient(on a network level) by design, but it needs to be to create an efficiency(In an external manner) by **avoiding censorship in value transfer**. If there was censorship risk in code execution than this would justify  ethereum to some degree(although not all their design decisions). But there is not censorship risk in code execution. Worse than this, if you are a programmer you would understand that it is trivial to obscure code in such a way that censorship is practically impossible even if all CPUs had microkernels specifically designed to censor certain code. Thus I cannot even fathom a dystopain future where ethereum makes sense and creates an **external efficiency** or **overall efficiency to avoid censorship**  . 


There is  a long list of problems with ethereum but this is the crucial flaw and makes the whole project nonsensical. You claiming that I cannot run code on my server or malware on my server is really ignorant.
I don't mean to come off as mean or rude , so please don't take this personally. There are plenty of well intentioned people in the ethereum community who are bamboozled by some of the nonsense from ethereum's creators and grokking some of these concepts is  difficult to grasp for many.

Make sure you avoid cloud mining(other people mining for you) as many scams exist. Mine with your own ASICs.
Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees which mean you will never ROI. Cloud mining typically falls into 3 categories
a) legit mining company that actually mines what you invest, but is misleading to clients the harsh reality of hashing difficulty increasing and fees = You will not profit and not make a ROI
b) Cloudmining company that fractionally reserve mines to keep up appearances and prove they actually are doing some mining but in reality do not mine the hashrate that they are contractually obligated to = You will not profit and not make a ROI
c) Straight up ponzi scheme with no mining = You will not profit and not make a ROI Mining is very competitive and if miners need to both pay for marketing, profit sharing , affiliate revenue, and management of many small clients or partners this overhead will quickly drive them out of business. Keep in mind that BTC mining difficulty is typically increasing , which means the payouts are fine initially but than naturally get smaller and smaller as the months go on. So at first everything seems fine than you notice later you start to get less and less until there is no payout.
**Right Now there are many con artists targeting people into cloud mining contracts and "investment opportunities" , by asking this question many may DM you, so you should be careful and avoid all private DMs.**
So people that cloud mine either come away from the experience bitter and don't return , or they make a profit , but not from mining but from the appreciation of Bitcoin during their contract. I.E... They invest 500 USD , cloud mining company pays back 300 USd of BTC over the next year , but because Bitcoin appreciated in value that BTC is now worth 800 dollars and the client is happy because they don't have the know how to compare what that investment would be worth if they simply sat on it and waited for their bitcoin to appreciate in value.

Did you even read my replies to you ? I have been clear that **historically** gold has been a fine hedge. You cherry picking those dates can even show some cases where a 50/50 portfolio will outperform a more stock heavy portfolio, sure. 
I don't believe gold will perform as well as a hedge vs newer uncorrelated asset classes like Bitcoin **going forward**. 
I gave these 4 reasons - 
1) Millennial and generation Z have shown far less interest in precious metal investing than older generations and this trend is not likely to reverse but get stronger
2) Any hopes of going back to the gold standard is now foolish where it used to be a very small probability 
3) There is no need for gold as a censorship resistant currency anymore with Bitcoin 
4) In 2026 Nasa will confirm the large amounts of gold soon to be mined causing speculators and states to further lose confidence in gold as an asset 
Gold has still not recovered from the peaks during 2011 and 2012 and while it might eventually find those prices again it will not perform as well as it has (lackluster unless you cherry pick the days) historically.

~17.5 TPS average @ 10 minute blocks , if blocks are found quicker you will see peaks above this, and depending upon the txs included in blocks you could see above 40% improvement so at times higher peaks. 
Also keep in mind that with onchain tx batching with 1 input and many outputs done by many companies 1 tx = hundreds or thousands of txs thus calculating the true amount of onchain txs is very complicated
Most altcoins never batch so people often compare apples to oranges when they are looking at onchain tx throughput. Onchain tx throughput with layer 2 solutions is also becoming less relevant.

My *guess* is a multi pronged approach.
1. seek consensus among devs
2. Write up more unit tests and more detailed spec and test more
3. Devs ask all companies and miners if they have any concerns or objections(like what was done with segwit before BIP 9/91 voting ) and also have an open request for all users to bring forward any valid concerns
4. Deploy code to get a supermajority of nodes upgrading and than a flag day UASF as long as a majority of nodes signal
The downside of this is an attacker could sybil non signalling nodes at the last moment to delay but this would be apparent and than we could simply flag day

What code do you have a problem executing on your server or home computer that could possibly be censored specifically? What hypothetical dystopian future are you suggesting where code can be censored if this is not the case? If you are a programmer you should be aware how futile such endeavors would be. 


Seems you completely missed my argument altogether. The point is that distributed blockchains are extremely inefficient by design, with or without proof of work and the reason for this is censorship resistance. If code cannot be censored in the first place Ethereum represents an inefficient, unscalable , large attack surface 
"world computer" that is a supererogation or a solution looking for a problem to  solve. 


I appreciate your honesty , but this is the crux of the problem. Con artists like Vitalik are selling a load of bullshit to people that are less technical and cannot evaluate the claims. UTXO model is vastly more scalable than a state model. 


Again, if there is no risk of censoring code on my server and the cost to run a smart contract is basically measured in computing cycles (next to free) than in comparison running that "smart contract" on ethereum is grossly insecure, costly, and inefficient. 
Smart contract = code that uses a bearer asset (simplest definition for modern use of this term ) 
Since traditional bearer assets like gold cannot easily be used in an automated way with code Bitcoin was the first currency to enable smart contracts with its scripting language. 
Efficient code can be used in an scalable and uncensorable manner on any server that can interact and  use Bitcoin or any well designed cryptocurrency thus running said code in an inefficient and unscalable manner within a blockchain is nonsensical. 


This is false - 
Also you cannot compare PoW to a premine and in fact mining back than was less profitable than now because bitcoin was worth nothing and one had to expend resources to create something worth nothing.

There is already onerous regulation in certain states regarding Bitcoin. Hawaii and New York are examples. This places a liquidity crunch on Bitcoin. There are already certain congressman in that country besides the president that have attacked Bitcoin and if many of these people start seeing this stamp on the fiat they handle daily this might be the straw that breaks the camels back causing them to focus on BTC instead of just some scammy ICO. They could start to impose regulations in their local state making it difficult for merchants , miners, atm operators, and exchanges in that state.

Yes , and part of the reason Bitcoin is secure is flying under the radar and not pissing off governments too much this early. It is better banks and governments are naive about Bitcoin and view it as insignificant rather than fear it for the time being. They certainly cannot stop it at this point but they can really slow growth down and make bitcoin much more insecure with a liquidity crunch. Better to keep governments focused on ICO's and privacy coins rather than Bitcoin, let them continue to believe that Bitcoin is controllable and traceable.

This is a problem with the "commons" and is a valid concern. Tactically speaking, damaging state property is counterproductive and often is a state and media propaganda vehicle to denounce anarchists or political dissidents . Typically it is anarcho-communists or collectivists that lack respect for property rights and they do a disservice to their message when they damage public or private property.
A much better tactic is the continual effort to reclaim public property into the hands of private individuals

u/Dominator477 make sure you avoid cloud mining(other people mining for you) as many scams exist. Mine with your own ASICs.
Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees which mean you will never ROI. Cloud mining typically falls into 3 categories
a) legit mining company that actually mines what you invest, but is misleading to clients the harsh reality of hashing difficulty increasing and fees = You will not profit and not make a ROI
b) Cloudmining company that fractionally reserve mines to keep up appearances and prove they actually are doing some mining but in reality do not mine the hashrate that they are contractually obligated to = You will not profit and not make a ROI
c) Straight up ponzi scheme with no mining = You will not profit and not make a ROI Mining is very competitive and if miners need to both pay for marketing, profit sharing , affiliate revenue, and management of many small clients or partners this overhead will quickly drive them out of business. Keep in mind that BTC mining difficulty is typically increasing , which means the payouts are fine initially but than naturally get smaller and smaller as the months go on. So at first everything seems fine than you notice later you start to get less and less until there is no payout.
**Right Now there are many con artists targeting people into cloud mining contracts and "investment opportunities" , by asking this question many may DM you, so you should be careful and avoid all private DMs.**
So people that cloud mine either come away from the experience bitter and don't return , or they make a profit , but not from mining but from the appreciation of Bitcoin during their contract. I.E... They invest 500 USD , cloud mining company pays back 300 USd of BTC over the next year , but because Bitcoin appreciated in value that BTC is now worth 800 dollars and the client is happy because they don't have the know how to compare what that investment would be worth if they simply sat on it and waited for their bitcoin to appreciate in value.

Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class .
Data - 
 one hedges or de-risks by having diverse portfolio with uncorrelated asset classes . Thus investing in altcoins does not give one this peace of mind because the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem is highly coorelated, but a small exposure to bitcoin is extremely wise. Russia or china rapidly growing in power and the yuan starting to become used more as a reserve currency and in trade could rapidly devalue the euro , pound and usd (somewhat coorelated ) therefore not hedging with gold and btc would be unwise. There is also the risk from bitcoin itself which could become a liquidity vacuum as nations and banks themselves start invest more (thus far I only see banks invest very small amounts to test and for ransomware). 
You could make the argument that all countries should resist the urge to buy bitcoin in unison , but the temptation for some may be all to great for a rapidly appreciating asset class that is free from the coercion of the petro-dollar. Once one country starts to hedge you may see others being forced to due to the economic implications of not.

A few points to consider -
1) Satoshi having 1 million BTC is a myth created by sergio which was quickly shown to be flawed and contradictory -
2) The most accurate estimates of BTC owned per person are from the mtgox leaks giving us some assumed estimates -
This shows around 70 people have between 10k - 100k BTC in April of 2014. Many of these early whales have spent , given away(here are 2 examples -  , or lost large amounts of their BTC so this number is likely half these days.
Thus if ~30-50 whales have between 10k - 100k BTC right now the next whale status would be 1k -100k BTC which might occur as soon as the next couple bubbles when we see the 10k and up whale count drop to 15-30 people

deadalnix is the handle for Amaury Sechet who is the lead developer funded by Bitmain who created the bcash altcoin in 2017 with the bcashABC implementation . 
There has been multiple growing feuds between bcash supporters/investors where part of them followed the con artist CSW on a new altcoin bcashSV , and now the devs between the BU implementation and bcash ABC implementation and the liar  roger are fighting. 
Part of this has to do with different roadmaps and perspectives, another part has to do with deadalnix pointing out when roger and other developers lie and being slightly more honest with the serious problems in bcash (BCH), and it is all exacerbated by the general stress that bcash is losing value compared to Bitcoin and failing to be a relevant project with each passing month.

Mostly speculation due to one day being a currency or speculation of being a more stable store of value. One cannot discount its use as a currency for regulatory arbitrage today as well, this is a circular economy of people who need Bitcoin thus an inelastic demand. It is unlikely that this demand for a uncensored currency in this category of transactions will disappear and is likely to grow larger

From that paper - 


Since Bitcoins monetary inflation policy has a long tail of disinflation it is very likely that Bitcoin will slow in appreciation (deflation) to a very slow growth or slow deflation in time. I would suggest that either modest inflation under 2% or modest deflation under 2% a year both allow for currency to excel at being great "units of account" which is critical and supports the above research that one should target 0% economic inflation(although it is impossible to consistently achieve 0%, states could target much lower inflation instead of 2-3% minimum) 
The other subtle distinctions between mild deflation and mild inflation have not been studied sufficiently but perhaps as Bitcoin grows in liquidity and drops in volatility we will see this experiment play out. 
There could be subtle changes in spending habits like people buying more reliable and durable goods with a currency that has mild deflation and less likely to invest in low yield bonds (the currency would essentially act as the secure bond)

Anything relating to Peter Joseph or the Zeitgeist movement you should be very skeptical about. He tends to focus on "structural violence" (Poverty/corruption) and his solution is essentially communism where instead of central planners deciding on resource allocation , a central computer or algorithms determine resource allocation.
The main problems with this is :
1) Human desires are near infinite and resources are scarce which he doesn't seem to fully grasp 
2) a central computer needs external inputs and its algorithms need to be designed and updated by human programmers thus you are replacing one set of central planners for another set of technocratic rulers 
3) He doesn't understand the main problem with communism and why capitalism will always be superior. Communism cannot solve the economic calculation problem as efficiently or accurately as capitalism thus resources and services are misallocated and misused to a much greater degree. A group of central planners does not have the combined intelligence  as all humans on earth and our tools(computers) in aggregate
4) while he is correct that humans are motivated to work , invent, and create for many reasons, one reason he doesn't appreciate is due to human selfish motivation with accumulation of capital , power and resources and removing this variable in order to achieve "equality of outcome" instead of merely "equality of opportunity" will lead to less productivity in a given society

There is a fallacy which rests on a false assumption that total amount electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost** of electricity burnt will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin.
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

I am not trolling but patiently explaining you the technical problems with ethereum. If you look at my post history I have a long history of explaining technical nuances to new users. 


There are many reasons for this but you are missing the point. The point is I can execute any code, including malware, on my server or home computer and no one can stop me. The fact that no one can stop me doing this means that ethereum is pointless 


Running code on the ethereum blockchain is extremely inefficient compared to me running code on one of my servers with raid 1 or 5 and an offsite backup. If I was concerned about censorship I might want the inefficiency of a blockchain to run my code. Since I have no fear of this than running code on a blockchain is a gimmick that is inefficient and expensive. 


No , ethereum is inefficient at running any code compared to a normal server, whether it is malware or not, remember you brought up malware initially. 


That is what it was marketed as by ethereum developers and creators and  still often marketed as this. 


You are forgetting the definition of smart contracts that I explained. You do not need to run "turing complete" code within a blockchain to run smart contracts. Bitcoin runs smart contracts without running Turing complete code for many years now. It is actually desirable to run non turing complete code to reduce the attack surface area, runaway tx fees from loops or recursion bugs. This is why Simplicity was created -  this more full featured scripting language might someday be useful but most things can be done in Bitcoins scripting language as is. If one wants or needs a turing complete language than all they need to do is code up script on there far more secure and efficient server and have that interact with their Bitcoin and this is their "Smart Contract" that is also turing complete. 


even the ethereum devs are admitting this is nonsense after the DAO fiasco. 


why not run your smart contract without a gas tax?


that is a major problem, a bug or a ddos can exhaust your ethereum making running dapps extremely expensive. This problem doesn't exist with smart contracts run from my server because I pay no gas tax. 


You are really missing the point when I discuss censorship. censorship would justify ethereum. The lack of censorship in running code means its pointless. 


Everyone can run code on their server or home computer and not have to worry about the high price of gas. If you think fees on ethereum are getting high now just wait till one Dapp becomes moderately popular. Cryptokitties was not anywhere close to being popular and it drove up fees and "crashed" ethereum 


Bitcoin can do smart contracts and complex accounting just fine. Why do you need loops and recursion on the blockchain? This is better suited off blockchain. 


This is untrue, Bitcoins scripting language is actually quite complex. 


ethereum is solving a problem that doesn't exist thus is more akin to carrying around a 50 kg battery to power a simple calculator when a 10 cent solar panel integrated within would suffice.

 There are a bunch of different Bitcoin git repos and implementations and they have different groups of developers. Since its an open source project than anyone can contribute and fork an existing repo and create their own implementation without permission. Many changes can be done without 100% consensus , but the consensus rules  across all implementations need to work within lockstep or that implementation will fork offchain, have all nodes reject it and essentially create an altcoin that no one uses until they change back to reach consensus.
Satoshi Nakamoto started Bitcoin and wrote the first working implementation. Developers like Sirius and Hal quickly started contributing.
Here is the original whitepaper - 
The first code was released before Bitcoin was launched for review- 
Different implementations(core, knots,btcd,bcoin,libbitcoin, ....) have different ways of coming to consensus. The most popular implementation called core  follows these guidelines 
 
where anyone is free to contribute , merges typically depend upon the consensus of the most 20-40 most active developers and there are typically at least 3 maintainers that simply act as janitors to merge what has already been agreed upon by all the most active contributors(this is in flux with people coming and going with their contributions). This is for any non consensus code changes. For any changes that require a soft fork or hard fork the roadmap to consensus is much more elaborate.  There is also a Gitian build process to insure consistency and security between developers which was created by Bitcoin and now used in many non Bitcoin open source projects - 
If you want to start to become a developer and review code than here is where to start-

People can hard fork whenever they want if they want new rules. I can't stop , nor want to prevent their ability to do so and this has little impact on what values I have with the rules I enforce. 


CB or xthin don't work under byzantine conditions. Validating txs must work, especially under attack scenarios . Thus you should use the calculator - 
Which reflects  	
Down: 	0.447Mbps down I will ignore the upload bandwidth for the time being due to assuming I would be leaching off the network to support your position the best.
This is too much bandwidth for my location.


The means you are suggesting severely undermines the security of the network as many of the security assumptions are dependent upon one being able to validate their own txs.


It isn't


They aren't though


Yes, it is in part . Bitcoins security and thus value is severely undermined right now due to centralization pressures in mining. Raising the blocksize harms this greatly due to block propagation latency.

IMHO LTC is not a scam but is a pointless project due to :
1) basically copying all of BTC upgrades 
2) PoW algo was promoted as being ASIC proof originally but that turned out to be untrue and ASICs mine LTC for the last few years
3) 2.5 minute block times was advertised as a feature when it is pointless with payment channels which have instant confirmations
4) Silver to Bitcoins gold was always a marketing lie as BTC doesn't have any issues with divisibility and the reason silver was used in currency is for smaller denomination coins

With a hardfork anything can be done, owners of old private keys would simply need to upgrade their node and since we are speaking about coins mined principally in 2010 they need to upgrade their node anyways due to the 3 previous hardforks in Bitcoin.

Lets stick to discussing facts instead of hand waiving away my facts and reasons


What efficiency can be found when there is no censorship in code execution? Be specific. 


ethereum's purpose was running uncensorable code , Bitcoin's purpose is uncensorable currency. They have different roles and purposes. Bitcoin finds an efficiency because there is censorship risk in value transfer and preservation. Since there is no censorship risk in code execution ethereum is pointless. If you want to pivot ethereum to compete as a decentralized currency instead as "fuel for smart contracts and a world computer" than its design is horrible in many ways from choosing a state model instead of UTXO model , to having a large attack surface with being "turing complete" to having a long list of design decisions which ignore security and scalability concerns and prioritize marketing. 


Ethereum was marketed as a worldwide computer yet fails to barely run a single useless project (cryptokitties) efficiently. It is being marketed as decentralized but extremely centralized and as you can see even running a non archival full node is difficult these days 


What matters is not your investments but discussing the details and technical design decisions of each project. Even if Vitalik is a scammer , and has a history of promoting scams as I have shown we need to discuss the specifics of each project and not the intentions of the creators.

The distinction between monetary and economic inflation with fiat currencies that have central banks that closely monitor and adjust interest rates to control economic inflation is moot but not with Bitcoin because a fixed control supply creates a currency where these two are sometimes widely different as we see this year where a monetary inflationary rate of ~3.8% differs from a year to date deflationary rate of ~110%. If people started hoarding USD quicker than the fed could "print" it, they would simply "print" more to insure USD always remained slightly inflationary unlike with Bitcoin.

I never said that and find it odd you are assuming I am suggesting it when I made it clear that gold won't have the same fate as salt, indigo and aluminum. 


When sociologists refer to generation Y(Millennials) and generation Z they are referring to age groups of humans in the western world which  includes many countries in Europe and all the Americas  -
Not just the USA. These countries control  a majority of earths wealth so for purposes of discussion are somewhat relevant. 


Did you read how I was clear that speculators and states will start to price in the future mining as soon as 2026? Are you aware how much gold is hoarded by nation states and how some states might slowly start to make the wise decision to offload this future liability?


In the rare example of a madmax or chicken little scenario gold will be very low on the list of priorities. Food, medicine, and bullets will be much more valuable and bullets would be a far better currency than gold. I have hedged in those assets even though I think Armageddon is unlikely.

Rather than doing all the math again, here is the shortcut-
7TPS was the average limit before segwit(in reality the TPS pre-segwit sometimes peaked above 10TPS due to variance)
14TPS with blocks mostly filled with segwit txs (2MB block averages)
14+25&amp; = 17.5TPS
14+40&amp; = 19.6 TPS (Variance would create higher peaks than 19.6)
Thus 17.5 TPS is not the max limit but the expected future average with full blocks

In the last 20+ years I have seen this bite many extranjeros in the ass . Yes , the process is extremely slow , but that is bad for both the employer and employee as he racks up lawyer fees and wasted time going back to court. Another issue is the largest tax is health care or caja (Typically 24% with 9% being paid by employee) . If they get injured or sick outside of work they will be forced to contact the labor administration . Also Without paying the INS any injuries on the job will also prompt you to pay out of pocket or face prosecution.
What is strange about this is the fact that many people who try and avoid these laws actually pay ticos higher salaries, bonuses and gifts than is normal as you re-affirm. I know of many people who have done this and than years down the line are forced to pay all the legal obligations so it is simply wiser to pay what is legally required IMHO .... but if they want to roll the dice than be my guest and learn the hard way
1 day a week or less it is usually wise to take the gamble and avoid the headache of paperwork , but even part time employees of 20 hours a week you should be 100% legal regardless as CR salaries are low enough as is and the laws don't really make it too onerous for employers. With all my employees I am 100% legal despite being an anarchist as it is merely the smart and practical solution in Costa Rica to protect yourself against the state.

Upgrading to Schnorr signatures merely requires a Soft Fork and I don't expect this to be controversial.

* Better privacy for participants of a Multi-Signature wallets
* transaction validate faster making bitcoin more secure and scalable
* Combat certain forms of spam attacks

Its just the cost of interest over 30 years. This assumes you have very good credit and low interest, if you have bad credit expect to pay much more in interest . It applies everywhere. Thus a 400k house will be close to 800k and you will pay mostly interest for the first 15 years thus have almost no equity.


wages don't have to drop if productivity increases greater than deflation


inflation tends to be a regressive tax, so you will likely benefit slightly


I consider discouraging high interest debt a good thing. Being a debt slave is not something we should encourage in society. People should save and invest. 


Since productivity tends to increase stagnant wages with low deflation could simply mean better spending power year after year without a drop in salary

I disagree for multiple reasons , but this is offtopic


I'm just looking for a single use case that has an efficiency. Please name one where the design considerations of Ethereum present an efficiency for a problem that exists.


Sure you can create smart contracts on Ethereum, no one doubts this , it is just done in the most inefficient and insecure manner is all , and as I have carefully explained there are far more secure, less costly , and more efficient ways to create smart contracts.


Ricardian contracts that can be vetted openly do not need to exist on a "turing complete" blockchain. They are much better suited not implemented in this insecure manner as we witnessed with the DAO hack. You have a really hard time understanding that the currency does not have to be the native token for the smart contract to work and its much better if the 2 are separate for security and scalability. 


The code does not need to be native within the blockchain and many people who suggest the statement above have no idea what can be done with the Bitcoin scripting language as well. 


I have been very precise in my language. Notice I keep saying the terms "efficiency, scalability, and security" This means that while you can build "useful" smart contracts on ethereum, you are using a platform that is far less secure, far less efficient, and far less scalable than building your smart contract with regular code on a server. This code can be audited and validated independently via open source software on the clients computer as well **without any fuel tax** so there is no need for a whole blockchain network to do this. 
To further elaborate, the most used smart contract script within blockchains today is multisig(Something Ethereum's head developer Gavin couldn't even get right), CLTV ,HLTC, and CSV. Other "smart contracts" in the blockchain ecosystem tend to be pointless at this moment because most applications need an external data source or deal with something external to the digital space thus ultimately rely on a TPP (trusted third party) thus most smart contracts do not add an efficiency or completely miss the security assumptions or attack vectors that need physical security like voting. Perhaps one day many more Dapps might find an efficiency but at the moment those 4 listed above with potentially, fraud proofs or vaults or custody and accounting smart contracts with miniscript will become the next useful smart contracts. Many promoted smart contracts from voting to supply logistics management to legal discussed these days is severely flawed. This doesn't mean that someone won't be able to find future useful dapps , but they should not be done on a "turing complete" blockchain for the many reasons I discussed.  


Now this is crazy talk. They are completely different blockchains, designed in completely different manners(like state vs utxo) and with different objectives.

Ethereum is scaling so poorly that it is extremely difficult to even sync a non archival node these days. 
MacBook Pro 2019 1TB SSD 32GB RAM 100Mbps
**non archival node Blockchain size: 195 GB and took 25 days to sync with many problems along the way on an extremely expensive new laptop**
This is merely validating the whole blockchain , but not technically a full archival node that would be several TB in size if you wanted to store all state changes(needed for some businesses and Dapps )

No, But a few of the devs have indicated they are going to make LN nodes have less overhead than full nodes so I would imagine a lot of hobbyists create LN nodes but not everyone . The competition for tx will be so fierce the nodes themselves will likely offer just a slight profit like mining does so I could see as many LN nodes as full nodes or more.
 &gt;How, specifically, do you think the UX will work out?
There are diff implementations but all aim to have the UX be more streamlined and easier to use than currently with bitcoin wallets: like paypal or stripe. 


LN assumes most nodes will have sporadic uptime and just routes around those to find pools of liquidity . Grandma Ln node is down , no problem , she just misses out on some tx fees she will share with miners.

1) buy BTC privately without ID at an atm, bisq, hodlhodl, in cash in person, or purse.io than no need to mix 
2) mine btc privately than no need to mix 
3) receive btc privately for good or service you sell without a third party payment processor than no need to mix 
4) buy BTC with your identity than mix it after with coinjoin (joinmarket or wasabi)

Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are familiar technically with bitcoin.  99 % of alts/ICOs are scams and it is best to understand the basics before investing.
Do not daytrade
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 
Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well

Miners typically rent warehouses and don't spend excessive amounts on infrastructure if they cannot secure a long term fixed rate electrical contract. Thus their lease is typically around the same length as their electrical contract. 
If local municipal power suppliers were concerned about sudden consumer demand for electricity in the next 3 years all they would need to do is stipulate that the rate is floating , and if they want to issue discounts can even stipulate a certain % under the floating consumer rate. 
This in turn would simply discourage some miners from moving there , and other miners would keep costs low and rent existing commercial space for shorter leases as a precaution. 
This way everyone wins , and total potential output from the hydro plant would not be squandered.

This paper reflects that 0% is the ideal target 
From that paper - 


Since Bitcoins monetary inflation policy has a long tail of disinflation it is very likely that Bitcoin will slow in appreciation (deflation) to a very slow growth or slow deflation in time. I would suggest that either modest inflation under 2% or modest deflation under 2% a year both allow for currency to excel at being great "units of account" which is critical and supports the above research that one should target 0% economic inflation(although it is impossible to consistently achieve 0%, states could target much lower inflation instead of 2-3% minimum) 
The other subtle distinctions between mild deflation and mild inflation have not been studied sufficiently but perhaps as Bitcoin grows in liquidity and drops in volatility we will see this experiment play out. 
There could be subtle changes in spending habits like people buying more reliable and durable goods with a currency that has mild deflation and less likely to invest in low yield bonds (the currency would essentially act as the secure bond)

I agree that lack of volatility is generally a desirable trait in a currency to be a good unit of account but we shouldn't be so quick to assume that mild economic inflation(0.5-3%) is preferable over mild economic deflation(0.5-3%).

Unfortunately, Bitcoin uses a poisson process where mining a block can sometimes be quick or take a very long time to discover. Sometimes it can take over 1 hour for blocks to be found and this creates a short term backlog.
This is why Core devs are so adamant on building payment channels like the lightning network. Increasing the blocksize doesn't speed up this process of confirmation delays, but the lightning network gives you instant confirmations in less than 1 second that settle to the main chain leading to a much better user experience.

While this article is right that a BTC fork is different than a ETH fork specifically because the differences in difficulty adjustment period it makes many flawed assumptions. 


This is one of the largest flaws in the article. Miners have razor thin profit margins and will quickly switch chains as we have seen time and time again within altcoins and even more recently as the ETh hashrate crashes for ZEC. One should assume that miners will follow profit. 
**75% hashrate does not necessarily mean that 75% of the community or the economic majority support the fork.**
Thus the true voting occurs after the fork with speculative attacks as we have seen before. One side will dump their BUfork coin on the other and vice versa until the dust settles and the miners will make the rational decision to switch to where the money is which isn't necessarily where the initial hashpower was. 
Another major flaw within the article is it ignores ideological considerations or the fact that rational investors may decide to follow the majority of technical specialists because that is likely a wiser direction forward. 
Personally, I believe BU is fundamentally flawed because of - 
Therefore my rational course of action would be to split my coins, than sell all my fork coins and reinvest in the original chain, wait for the dust to settle and if the miners haven't switched back than implement a POW algo switch(the code is already ready and we are prepared). I have no problem with forks in principle if they are done safe or a necessary condition for security so firing the miners if needed isn't a big deal.

Unlike many altcoins , bitcoin is decentralized. Core devs each have individual opinions , come from many backgrounds and often disagree. Core devs cannot impose a hard fork on the community and we can and will reject many of their hard fork proposals with as little effort as inaction\(Bitcoin core doesn't auto update\) or using one of many other bitcoin implimentations. 
This doesn't mean that core and other implementations devs do not desire or refuse to  work on hard forks \(they have spent thousands of hours developing hard forks in the past and still work on them\). This doesn't mean that a new hard fork will never happen in bitcoin. \(3 HFs with consensus have occurred in the past [ \) A future hard fork with consensus among the most of the economic community could easily happen under certain scenarios \(breakthrough HF proposal with little downsides or protocol bug that effected everyone where some other concerns\(scaling\) where added\) or under other scenarios take more work. 
There may not even be a need to do any future hardfork as we may just decide as a community to scale with sidechains/drivechains or SF upgrades. There seems to be an odd obsession or fear when people discuss HFs as if they have some sort of anxiety that bitcoin won't adapt when if they participated in the development process they would see that bitcoin is changing and evolving all the time.

This happens all the time. They are called alts , and there are thousands of examples. Users have the freedom to choose any consensus rules they want free from coercion. They can do this individually or as part of a larger group. This is trivial to do. 
You aren't insinuating that you prefer a system where individuals can force others to run larger block sizes like 8MB are you?


Segwit increases the blocksize to between 1.8 to 4MB in size. It will immediately give individual users at least 1.8MB of capacity and if more multisig is used 2MB or higher. With MAST and Schnorr sigs the effective blocksize will average closer to 3MB and higher. 
Segwit increases the blocksize in an intelligent manner that has many more benefits than simply changing the maxBlockSize variable as it reduces UTXO bloat which is very important. It does so by added a concept of block weight instead of simply blocksize to better account for resource costs for a more scalable and secure network. Each byte of witness data costs 1 unit of weight, and each byte of non-witness data costs 4 units of weight. The total sum weight of a block must not exceed 4,000,000. The weight is determined by the amount of impact the resources have on the network.

There are no restrictions or impositions from states like the US when it comes to a larger  Ancom communities. They can exist tax free legally the same as smaller ones. The lack of capitalism simply makes them inefficient and not a threat to the state , they crumble from within at scale. Petty infighting and disagreements and jealousy tends to destroy these communities apart.

Yes , Which means that is supporting what many suspected. There was an overzealous rush for merchants adopting bitcoin initially where there isn't much transaction velocity with bitcoin used for the whitemarket. The businesses/merchants that have been most successful in our ecosystem are the illegal gambling sites, dark market drug sites , ransomware, and prostitution. Grey market businesses have also done fairly decently like purse.io. 
This stalling isn't due to any limitation with bitcoins capacity but the stark reality that bitcoin isn't mature enough for most consumers . Overall the UX is bad and from a consumer standpoint they would much rather spend debt(money they don't have) that gives them 
cash back (up to 2%) than pay a btc tx fee. Lowering the tx from 7 pennies down to 1 penny wont help much either as you are competing with 0 fees or cash back for consumers using credit cards. 
This can eventually change with the LN and better UX development but we still  need work done.

This is done to clarify to users that just because 0.13.1 is going to be released in a couple days doesn't mean they will be able to use segwit on mainet.
Of course Segwit can be delayed , even indefinitely if 95% isn't achieved. I'm not worried though, because the group blocking it are being petty and absurd , represent a small fraction of the community, and most of the wealth is held with those that support the core roadmap so we don't even need to lower the activation threshold at all . What will likely happen is we will wait a couple months and if ViaBTC doesn't give up from embarrassment we will just out hash them.

Signature aggregation with schnorr allows one to reduce the size of txs so you can fit more within each block. This is the smart way to increase capacity by 40% or more without any of the negative repercussions involved in simply raising the block limit.

There is no way to know what percentage is kept in btc or fiat because bitpay allows one to adjust from 0-100%. There are two different things we need to focus on here:
1) Businesses who keep a portion or all in bitcoin(no solutions right now that can prove this) 
2) Businesses that accept only bitcoin which forces the consumer to buy and use bitcoin to transact with a business. 
Both are crucial independently as we must get get people accustomed to the experience of using and securing their own bitcoin in general. What would be even better than this is a business offering a good or service that wasn't offered anywhere else (like a unique hotel or product) that had huge demand only accepting bitcoin. This would drive many to take the leap and invest in bitcoins future.

Arbitrage does exist but can be risky. Right now there is a 7-9 dollar premium at Circle , but you run the risk of BTC going up when you try and complete the circle because the fiat/banking delays. You have to use gdax and coinbase instant buys charge too high of a fee. You are essentially making the bet that Bitcoin wont increase by 8 dollars in 5 days here to make a small profit. Thus this gamble should only be entertained by those with very large amounts of btc , and once you dump btc on circle the premium will quickly shrink

All it would take is a few large investors dumping their coins on one fork and rebuying on another to encourage miners to switch. Most of the large investors are conservative and pro cores roadmap. Ver and Garzik are a few exceptions, Gavin kept dumping most of his BTC for traditional investments so I don't know how much he has. My rough estimates range from 90-95 % of the top investors are more conservative. (Eg- Most core developers have been around since the early days)

LN and payment channels allow any non mining nodes or users to temporarily lock up btc in payment channels to process txs and compete with miners for fees creating a market for very low fees. The competition will be very fierce as the barrrier for entry will be so low to operate a LN node pymt channel fees will be very low. These txs all will be eventually settle on the mainchain so we are counting on a high volume of small fees on layer 2 to settle a fewer amount of fees on the main chain.

This happens around 3 times a year , but will cause a backup.
This guy is to blame- 
If blocks are 16MB in size this would still occur as its unrelated to blocksize. Others here will disagree and claim that the tx backlog would instantly clear with the first block after the 1.75 hr delay . I would disagree as there is no shortage of cheap txs that will fill up blocks due to the use of bitcoin being used for other things than just currency.
Also it doesn't help when miners like this don't include any txs right after -
There is no reason to do this and the ironic thing is the pools that are more sympathetic to larger blocks tend to do this more often.
What would help in this case is if your tx was a LN tx , than you would get a LN confirmation which has a similar level of security as a onchain confirmation within 1 second and never have to wait over 1 hour due to the Poisson process.

While there are many ways to increase capacity with softforks or extension blocks I have no problem with adjusting maxBlockSize variable either.


Prudent, but too conservative. By having conviction and following through I am increasing the probability that my chain will convince the hashpower to follow. Thus being conservative can be dangerous in such a scenario. I have no confidence in the group pushing the HF so the decision to "go all in" is an easy one for me. 


Sure, but it likely won't come down to this as the majority of miners and economic power , and devs are behind the core plan. Why do I need to fork now when everything is going in the direction I like?

This is a fallacy and rests on a false assumption that **total amount** electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost of electricity burnt** will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin. 
This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms  of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will  rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin  even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more  and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more  and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical  production.

Yes, that is also one of my criticisms of factom as well. There is no practical need to store complete books or contracts on a public blockchain. Store it locally as a backup and use 1 or 2 oracles like Tierion to store it with a timestamped hash on the bitcoin blockchain and you are done. Anything more than this is an act of supererogation.
Considering ethereum is quite silly as ethereum is very far from being immutable and will be even less so when they switch to PoS.

In Summary -
cypherpunk roots-
Many attempts to create sovereign currency. B-money, hashcash, ect...Than Satoshi started posting - 
Bitcoin is an experiment in anarchism-
It was created as an exit from state and bank currency. Even today it is primarily used for regulatory arbitrage. 
Ironically enough it is also a hedge against Anarchism. If States and Banks disappear(not going to happen) than bitcoins largest premium evaporates supporting its utility, value, and thus security. One day more and more statists will start to realize this inconvenient truth: The strength and growth of the state indirectly supports the premium those will pay for bitcoin to convert energy into fungible value thus they would be wise to invest in bitcoin and the flip side investing into bitcoin supports the security of this anarchistic currency.

That is there intention all along and it is painfully transparent . They want to block scaling so they can force a negotiation to double the size of the capacity increase from 1.8/2Mb  to 4Mb or higher. This isn't going to work, they would be better off on finding ways to increase scalability without such high negative consequences. We will just either keep the status quo or out hash them if they continue to block progress. We make technical decisions based upon data and facts and not sidedeals to appease the hearts of those who are upset.

People are willing to regularly pay a high premium to buy drugs , whores or gamble online. 
People are willing to regularly pay a high premium to pay the ransomware tax that is common now and only growing with no way to stop it.
People are willing to pay a 20-30% premium on the grey market to redeem amazon points and unspent giftcards for btc. 
The reality is states heavily subsidize the inefficient and "wasteful" database that is bitcoin and the only way for them to stop subsidizing this premium is for all laws and regulations in society to disappear. This is delusional thinking. States , banks, fiat , laws are here to stay and thus will heavily subsidize the premium of bitcoin just like they do with the costs of all blackmarket items. Whether its bitcoin or some other future PoW crypto (likely btc) it is here to stay and will only grow in value. 


The expense is specifically what establishes security. 


That would prevent them from all the bailouts, inflation, quantitative easing , ect and you are ignoring the importance of allowing anyone to mint in a decentralized fashion rather than a central group of bankers controlling the supply. 
I get it , you are either a buttcoiner or troll, but one day you will have to come to a sad realization that we aren't going away and that states heavily subsidize the premium that is bitcoin and the only way to destroy most of bitcoins value is if the whole world converted to lawless anarchism.

The risk of Fiat dropping is guaranteed.

The beauty with schnorr is that it doesn't technically increase the blocksize , but increases the txs throughput. 
MHO, we should optimize as much as possible and find solutions that don't have negative consequences before making trade offs that do. This means that when the limit is increased we will already be more scalable and have an added bonus of higher capacity as reducing the signature size within blocks is a set % improvement affecting all increases in the future.

This research has slowed down because there are other SF scaling priorities like MAST and Schnorr Sigs, and helping bitcoin scale with LN, but will eventually pick up again. You are free to participate as well because core accepts BIPs and code from anyone.

Yes, you are correct that we have inept mild-socialism in this government which means that as a matter of practice many communities are very anarcho capatalistic due to this ineptitude(for better or worse). With CAFTA being approved we are starting to move out of socialism and have had competition with communication companies for the first time(claro and moviestar) but this legacy means we just barely beat Afghanistan in internet bandwidth speeds . Banks are still controlled by the government and even private banks (citibank and hsbc ) are really costa rican banks paying for the branding .
I do have to warn extranjeros who think they can get away with paying ticos under the table. This usually ends badly for them as they believe that a contract between the employee  or better compensation will allow them to avoid labor law . In most cases what ends up happening is the employee keeps the gifts and bonuses and than complains to the department of labor regardless and the law protects the citizens. It is far wiser to simply follow the law for employee taxes rather than think you can outsmart the system unless you have a temporary worker 1 day a week or less and any back taxes would be trivial to cover if needed

factom  is currrently centralized as well as they are the issuer of the factoids . Perhaps in the future enough of these coins will distribute and they will become decentralized. I don't see what usecase we need in a decentralized anchor tech. Do you really see issues arise with for profit oracles not correctly creating the hash for their clients? It is trivial to create a hash directly if they start censoring. 
Even their platform is open source- Http://Chainpoint.org   .. I don't work with them and want more competitors offering this service , but factoms approach really doesn't make much sense as the decentralized aspect is the bitcoin blockchain itself and its trivial to switch oracles.
I think the main drive behind factom rests on the idea that we need to decentralize everything (and why they are more open to using the silly project that is EThereum ) . Decentralization has very big costs and inefficiencies and many times isn't needed at all.

Some of those channels will facilitate millions of people , but ok , mr negativity... how about you do the math and compare the difference in capacity bitcoin will have between 56 network TPS only with 8 MB blocks vs 14TPS with segwit + LN with 200-400 Billion TPS for users who do not use LN wallets at all. I contend that the high usage customers who will be using LN are the same ones that would quickly clog up that 14TPS or 56TPS and with LN there will be far less onchain activity with LN. Thus segwit + LN = more tx capacity for non LN users vs simply 8MB blocks without LN. While I understand that we could have 8MB with segwit + LN , but that would be a reckless upgrade where we don't first measure the impact of a massive increase in onchain capacity with segwit alone . Doubling the average size of the blocks is massive!

UASF reveals everyones hands at the table. They will either need to activate segwit with BIP141 or BIP 91 before, follow users before Aug 1st on BIP148 , or plan an emergency HF(that few will follow). Inaction and stalling from Bitmain and others isn't a choice due to the risk of reorgs and the momentum that we are building.

If they want to MASF segwit, it is fine by me, but I will not be agreeing to that silly 8MB limit segwitx2MBHF Frankenstein, and UASF 148 will still move forward till segwit is activated and thereafter we will further develop UASF for future upgrades. 
This will be the case even if the core devs agree to the segwitx2MBHF , agreeing for political reasons will just make me lose respect for them. No more backroom deals without seeking consensus from the users.

If we wanted to discuss capacity only (which is different than scaling) this is the breakdown -
1) Segwit = 1.8 MB - 2MB blocks basically doubling capacity for segwit wallets. If everyone upgrades to segwit we would see between 12-14 Transactions per second 
 2) Schnorr sigs = 17% to over 40% more effective capacity thus blocks act like they are 2.1MB to 2.8+MB effective or up to 20 TPS. 
3) LN will significantly increase the amount of TPS ontop of this but the exact numbers are based upon many variables like the length of time the coins stay in payment channels. 


No, LN txs only settle for a longer period of time to the main chain like once every 2 week , up to 6 month or longer. The longer they say locked in a a channel than the more tx throughput.

Why would you ever sell any bitcoin for less than the market rate? People pay a premium of 5-15% for local bitcoin buys above market price of bitcoin. 
Technically, with purse.io you could divest your btc at 20% above market price quite easily. 
Him offering you -3% is just insulting as there is strong demand for acquiring btc.
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:13:13
Let me entertain your hypothetical (I don't think BU will get anywhere near this support)- 
1) ViaBTC gets 75% by getting other pools to switch over and shortly after activates-28 to 60 days . 
2) Just because a majority of the hashpower activates a fork it doesn't mean that the economic majority is behind this fork. It is hard to say what they will do during this transition 
While I have no control over others , I do have control over my own private keys. My action if BU activates the fork is to split the coins myself as described above than deposit my new BUfork coins in an exchnage to sell off immediately than exchange the fiat for the original Bitcoin and withdraw them. I do not store my coins on an exchange(paperwallets from when mined with gpus, and HW wallet from purchased) as I don't want to be at risk of them being stolen (coinbase still hasn't paidout ETC months later ) . 
I don't do this to attack the other forked chain, but just out of pragmatic way to profit off of the chain. I am motivated by both idealogy and profit and it would be silly of me to miss an opportunity to increase my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 21:21:43

Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading
Day traders find that they become obsessed with checking the price and end up spending most of their productive time looking at charts instead of working for a salary.
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying

If the segwit SF has the possibility of being blocked than a non -contentious HF will be much more difficult to accomplish . Remember there are people in our ecosystem that never want any changes even segwit like  and  (I think these people are nutcases but they do present a threat for HF's)which represents a very old group of bitcoin users with big investments. Segwit as a softfork doesn't prevent them from running their old nodes , but they will likely to perform a speculative attack if a HF occurs and we will be left with 2 coins like ETH /ETC.

If Olivier wants bitcoin to compete with Visa at 2500 TPS with just on chain blocksize increases than we will need over 357MB blocks.
Lets do the math : This would allow for up to 18,324GB to be added to the blockchain every year. And disk space is the least concern we have as well. Validation times, memory , and bandwidth required will be insane.
The fastest i7 processor wouldn't be able to validate a 357MB block in 10 minutes on nodes. 
For example certain 8MB blocks can take over 11 minutes to validate on an average CPU.
For more details read this - 
Test it yourself with this benchmark code- 
This is only 8MB as well. What Olivier is suggesting is an obscenely large 357MB blocksize.
Combined with CVE-2013-2292 attack it can even be much worse.
Segwit improves matters but isn't a panacea. Linear scaling of sighash operations(that segwit provides and other implementations don't provide) prevents specific types of attacks where blocks are filled with many outputs. Each byte still can be hashed up to twice in which very large blocks still run into validation delays.
**However Olivier is looking to block the very upgrade which solves this problem - segwit!**
How can anyone take this guy seriously?

Even if we ignore all the politics and history of miners threatening users and the lies ... I literally cannot HF with this proposal because I wouldn't be able to validate my own txs with the projected blocksizes they are aiming at anytime soon.

We should be honest with each other how we feel and what we want in bitcoin. Do you disagree?


Not at all. I believe that most miners are merely holding segwit ransom in an attempt to get more, but aren't actively opposed to the changes within segwit. If they adopt segwit with UASF they win. If they choose not to and HF they win as well because they get what they want with whatever HF proposal they desire. We both win.

Some changes need Hard forks , but many things can be done with a soft fork, so yes... if both options produce the same result than we should always prefer a soft fork.

Many people like myself believe this is dangerous. This doesn't mean we should never hard fork, core is working on many safe hard fork proposals    but more of an issue where we should get consensus with the supermajority of the community first .

Hello Hosh4. Avoid mining unless you are very familiar with bitcoin. Hint - You need to mine with many ASICs to be profitable as mining is very competitive and specialized. 
Better you buy bitcoin from a reputable exchange like coinbase/gdax/bitstamp/kraken , ect or attain bitcoin by selling goods and services for it. 
To start a safe and smart savings here are some of the most important tips-
1) Get a Hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor   To secure your bitcoins.
2) Do not get greedy and start investing in alts (bitcoin is a risky investment as is and alts are like very dangerous penny stocks)
3) Do not download dangerous software that promises free btc or invest in schemes that promise returns like cloud mining sites or ponzi schemes. You should use a HW wallet and for day to day spending copay or mycelium on your cell phone .
4) Spend btc on sites like purse.io to save 20% off amazon(no digital items , just physical items) , but always rebuy more btc first with trusted exchanges like circle/kraken.
5) Do not day trade , there is a high chance you will lose money. Just buy on a regular basis or set limit buy orders in to grab the dips and hold to accrue a nestegg.

No but after the fact multiple companies who signed indicated support for BIP148 if the compromise didn't activate segwit by july


Depends upon the definition of success. BIP 148 will indeed be a failed version of Bitcoin if the economic majority doesn't follow and should be called an altcoin at that point in time. I am ok with this and happy to walk away from bitcoin for this new altcoin if need be and consider the Bitcoin project a failure.

It may indeed go down temporarily , but historically returns 9.7% which is much better than gold/silver. With the problems in the EU most countries are hedging in the US dollar and US economy as a safe haven so regardless of how reckless the US(other countries are worse) is I think one should feel comfortable with it for at least 20 more years. 
If one does get gold(skip silver) than one should not buy gold certs but personally secure it themselves. Like bitcoin , if you don't personally secure it you dont own it.

Proof of Work is why we are all here. There is real demand for regulatory arbitrage that isn't going away anytime soon. PoS is insecure and merely having trusted parties control the network unlike with bitcoin where hash power typically follows the cheapest source of electricity and most efficient production. PoW is a very simple and secure means of establishing trust and truth by expending real world resources in game theory. 


Both ways is true. This is because bitcoin has real world utility that people are willing to spend a very high premium for to conduct regulatory arbitrage.

I never threatened to attack miners , in fact I very openly stated that Jihan has every right to run whatever code he wants and mine whatever chain he prefers and I won't stop him or attack his chain.

Kudos to Jeff for being reasonable here. I am hopeful but Jihan has already rejected BIP91 thus it will get interesting if he sticks to this position and it falls apart. Either way it means that segwit will likely happen as the community outrage when Jihan backs out will catapult BIP 148 forward.

There is only one person who could have made the decision and it wasn't Todd. I'm frankly surprised you even have to ask, and no, no one is claiming it is permanent either. The most I have heard is that it is *likely* permanent by one dev(and not by one who has any say in the matter).

I think what he is referring to is the misleading Segwit2Mb - promoted by sergio. This would not fall in the "2-4MB (segwit)+lightning" because the blocksize would be between 4-8MB and it is a HF.

P.S... Why don't you ever honestly represent the proposal by saying the true limit you are proposing? It is seriously misleading to those who don't know. You are asking for a 8MB limit that is voted upon in such a way that can easily be gamed.... Or are you really suggesting we throw away segwit with a 4MB limit for a 2MB limit?

Remember we are talking about limits here. Bitcoin must be designed for an adverserial environment. It is unfortunate that we can be ddos attacked with signature filled blocks, but luckily this attacks greatest concern is on bandwidth and block propagation latency and balancing out UTXO costs far outweighs the downsides of attackers filling blocks with signatures. Yes, it will be rare a non malicious block will be mined that is 3.7MB in size, but it will occasionally occur.

My comments equally apply to mining hosts where most users naturally decide to keep their hardware within the host. 
Why ?
1) Further centralizes mining reducing bitcoins security
2) No guarantee that they aren't fractionally reserve mining because most users will never ask for their hardware
I recommend people mine with p2pool if they cannot solomine.

Most early adopters with the exception of Garzik, Ver, and Gavin(although he sold much of his btc for traditional investments so I don't know if he has much left and Hearn is def off that list) are conservative and support the core roadmap. The way we can know this is that most core developers are early adopters , and many old users from bitcointalk are also more conservative in their scaling- I talk to these people all the time.  These people all have much higher probabilities of being in the top 1% bitcoin holders. Also another great thing about having a lot of Bitcoins is you have a lot to lose therefore you are more likely to do your research and come to the conclusion that cores scaling roadmap is more rational and safer path forward.


Which is why there is no plans of doing so. Most would rather just keep the status quo than lower the activation support from 95%. Also, Remember we have diverse interests like fungibility and other important things to work on to improve bitcoin and can certainly be patient unlike the very small obnoxious capacity at any cost crowd.

There is no such thing as SPV in Bitcoin at the moment due to the lack of fraud proofs. Only lite clients and pseudo-SPV wallets exist outside of full nodes. 


Exactly. So if miners "Soft Fork " in Ext blocks without the consent of the community we will consider this an attack and take action. If the super majority of users(not hashrate alone) agree with ext blocks with a 48MB block limit, I also won't follow that chain and will HF off on my own with as many other that agree. I am not interested in running a lite client alone and not having p2pcash.

You think there are only 2 sides?
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:59:19
What I would be interested in --
1) Activate segwit and gather more data for 1 year 2) Over the course of a year(simultaneously with above - gathering data) devs work together and develop spoonnet activation HF with a BIP 103 like scaling proposal with added in HF wishlist items. 3) Minimum 1 year for testing
4) Time to get consensus in the community (6 months to 2 years) 5) Minimum 1 year lead time for activation
Thus any HF would be around 4 years away at minimum. Which would have the added benefit of allowing the worldwide infrastructure to improve a bit more to alleviate the network from the huge blocksize jump that segwit provides.
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:54:11

The NY agreement had a broken proposal without code that cannot possibly activate segwit. The individuals who signed either don't understand BIP 141 and 9 or deliberately trying to stall by recommending a broken proposal.
 &gt;It's insane to have a small group of people deliberately causing a chain split with no mining.
It wont be so small come August, and keep in mind that a HF (NY proposal) will definitely cause a chain split but UASF might avoid it if miners decide not to attack the users.

1) It sets the standard that HF can be negotiated by backroom deals which opens us up to future attacks on the protocol where miners or devs can add in features users don't want 
2) It sets the standard that upgrades can be bundled together , I.E.  pork belly politics, for political reasons instead of technical ones(We need to see how the network reacts to segwit and how LN plays out before agreeing to a follow up HF a year later 
3) A HF involves a lot of work , and this simple one isn't worth the effort thus setting the standard of many small HFs instead of one HF that permanently solves scaling. 
4) 4MB average blocksizes is too large for 1 year from now and the ecosystem needs time to adapt to the large increase of doubling capacity. 
5) This simple HF won't interest enough in the community and thus will definitely split the network. The HF we need to adopt should contain enough elements to interest most of the community like segwit does.

To the end consumer many aren't aware of this and their behavior typically only looks at their selfish personal interest instead of the macro effects from chargebacks and merchant processing fees has on indirectly raising the prices of everything. This is a shame , but a psychological reality we must acknowledge.  
Thus the end consumer typically thinks like this :
 I get 2 % cash back , my tx is free, I am insured against fraud with a maximum 50 dollar deductible and I don't have to learn how to use this weird new, too technical currency that I fear is dangerous and used by terrorists and is insanely volatile.
The only way to remotely compete with this is with services like purse.io which can offer a 20% discount but even than many consumers feel this is too much of a hassle and don't bother. I personally know this because I have personally introduced at least 1k people to bitcoin .

1) No HF wishlist items included, It would be wise to include many aspects that can motivate most of the community in a HF , otherwise you will get too much of the community disagreeing or just not be motivated enough to upgrade their full nodes.
2) What is the purpose of HF in this capacity increase when segwit is ready, tested and can do so easier with a SF? This appears to be an attempt to Hf for HF sake which sets a bad precedent to encourage many HFs in the future
3) We should gather more data with the very large blocksize increase segwit provides first and see how LN plays out before blindly jumping to a HF.

Every user has the active decision to use whatever implementation they choose to and the miners and developers are powerless over them with this regard. There can be no force or coercion involved and the developers even go out of their way to insure that users have to actively accept any changes by making them download and install updates rather than to automate this process at the cost of UX like most software does.

Perhaps if we can simply rally enough users and businesses owners behind UASF in general we can have the developers discuss the safest path forward more in the open.

Unfortunately , despite all the FUD from r/btc and the crazy HF proposals distracting most of the community I don't believe states or banks are really spending too much time disrupting our ecosystem. They are keeping their eye on it and studying it out of curiosity and don't really see bitcoin as much of a threat yet.
I think that half of the people causing drama are buttcoiners/trolls/or trying to pump an alt and the other half are indeed sincere believers in the naive HF proposals like BU, XT, Classic.
 This means that the drama will only increase in the coming years when they do fee threatened.

They are either confused or feigning ignorance because they desire much bigger capacity. Notice how BU is voting for 16MB blocks now. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:40:24
You can use BIP91 or some other hacks that involves rewriting code and tests and  6 more months of testing on a new testnet. Keep in mind that it took almost a year for segwit to get 96% node support and BU to get almost 3 % node support so nodes don't upgrade quickly. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:21:00
The bottom line is the total limit would be 8MB  with average blocks of 3.8MB when most wallets have upgraded. Allowing blocks to hit nodes up to 8MB will have some nasty consequences according to the research.

This doesn't matter(stolen , lost or damaged HW wallets) as the 12 or 24 word backup restores all your txs and btc and HW wallets have pins that delay access exponentially with every wrong attempt.


Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

I recommend people read this article. When I was younger I lived paycheck to paycheck and was quite frivolous with spending . Fiat currencies have inflation negating the benefits of savings. Traditional investing have high fees and taxes making them less interesting. Yes, you can get 9.7% out of a US index fund but than have to pay capital gains taxes on such an asset which, coupled with interest make gains less impressive. 
Saving became really interesting and rewarding with bitcoin and has given hope to many to buy homes and new businesses without being indentured for life with debt.
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:40:04
I have many backup plans and open to hearing others as well. I and others will judge these backup plans on their technical merits.
Eg -- Segwit as a HF being superior than segwit as a softfork is a lie and has no good evidence to support its claims. The arguments of technical debt and being safer are just FUD to anyone familiar with segwit code. Thus if this is someones backup plan I want no part of it. This doesn't mean I'm closed off to other suggestions. I am all ears for rational evidence based discussions. 
My backup plans if segwit doesn't activate and a stalemate occurs - 
1) focus working on fungibility and other important tasks on bitcoin while we wait for them to concede 
2) Help organize and plan multiple bitfury groupbuys to both further decentralize mining and get core's hashrate up
and others...
@_date: 2016-10-12 23:03:56
Are you aware that there are more ways to fire the miners than simply changing over to Keccak SHA3 mining on GPU's? For example - Say 75% of hashpower is controlled by a group of mining operators (not pools, as users can easily leave pools) get behind an implementation that looks to start blacklists. Firstly we wouldn't even need to fire them but just sell off their fork and buy into the original chain without blacklists, but lets say they carry on mining in a very wasteful manner a heavily devalued coin that no one wants for huge losses because they are being paid by a state or bank. 
We could than take the remaining 25% hashpower , tweak the consensus algo to include merge mining on ASICs and on nodes with either PoS or a memory hard Keccak SHA3 to retain the Botnet resistance of the ASIC's and fend off any 51% attacks from the 75% ASIC cartel that is controlling a worthless coin.

Yes, there are indeed many costs inherent in centralized mining that aren't associated with decentralized mining like security, employee salaries, rent, insurance, cooling, ect.

Since there is an estimated 1k people in the top 1% there certainly could be many hidden individuals who haven't voiced their opinion I'll admit , but we can only analyze the data we do have and extrapolate from there.

12 Months is rushed. Let me tell you what sort of HF may interest me so you get an idea. 
1) Activate segwit and gather more data for 1 year 
2) Over the course of a year(simultaneously with above - gathering data) devs work together and develop spoonnet activation HF with a BIP 103 like scaling proposal with added in HF wishlist items. 
3) Minimum 1 year for testing  
4) Time to get consensus in the community (6 months to 2 years)
5) Minimum 1 year lead time for activation 
Thus any HF would be around 4 years away at minimum. Which would have the added benefit of allowing the worldwide infrastructure to improve a bit more to alleviate the network from the huge blocksize jump that segwit provides.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:38:55
Thanks for sharing your opinion , I would definitely never run that code even if almost all miners and devs supported it. I don't want to follow a chain that starts a dangerous precedence that changing or removing the rules was so flippant.

A HF blocksize increase is easy to do irresponsibly but difficult to do safely. BU crowd just don't want one HF either but many.


Segwit has been well tested for 2 years and ready.


Only? Are you aware how slow nodes are to upgrade currently? Additionally, there is a ton or firmware , script, apis , ect that would also need to be updated outside of every node software


Many of us prefer a permanent scaling solution if we have a HF and  to include multiple HF wishlist items . HFs require a lot of careful planning and a coordinated effort throughout the ecosystem so you need to have almost everyone on board and do 18m to 2 years of prep at minimum otherwise you will be left with many problems

This is the least important issue. Network latency for block propagation and bandwidth being the most important. CPU/RAM for fast validation times and mempool next in importance , and Hard drive space being the least of a concern.

Extblocks has very little support because there are some real and serious concerns about the proposal even outside of devs - 
Thus a legitimate concern is this is a distraction that has little hope of being adopted. 
Here are some other concerns with extblocks - 
1) More technical debt and complexity than segwit 
2) Being promoted dishonestly
3) not backwards compatible with old nodes , just old wallets unlike segwit 
4) not ready
5) Can use up to 48MB According to this proposal - immediately without user approval
6) All nodes must validate all data otherwise you are left with psuedo SPV levels of security. They are misleading users to believe that you can get away with validating only the 1MB chain.

Block weight with segwit balances UTXO costs which is extremely important. It is very important we activate segwit before any HF for multiple reasons: Gather more data first before making assumptions, and segwit makes further capacity increases much safer. 


Than you don't understand the importance of balancing UTXO costs. This is much more important than simply bandwidth concerns from the blocksize alone. For example I would be far more comfortable with segwit with 4 MB limit(4 million units of weight) than a simple HF of 2MB limit because of the importance in balancing UTXO costs. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:53:17

Many people are not asking for a Hf and actively opposed to these proposals so a HF would definitely split the chain in 2-3 , while a UASF only has a risk of doing so if the miners don't follow the users.


I don't want miners or devs centralizing control of bitcoin. Even if 100% of core devs support that HF I would reject it due to being technically unsound and would lose all respect for them and suspect they were compromised. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:45:48
UASF BIP 148 will happen regardless as there are already enough BIP148 nodes that even if it was a bluff(It is not) than some of these will activate on Aug 1st and enforce segwit as it is extremely unlikely that everyone will coordinate and change their nodes back at the last momment.
This isn't a threat to the miners, They can continue running non segwit nodes safely as long as they run a border node, we welcome them to join the community , but if they don't that is fine as well as it just reflects how centralized mining has become and they aren't benefiting us regardless by staling progress.

2) Do not get greedy and start investing in alts (bitcoin is a risky investment as is and alts are like very dangerous penny stocks)
3) Do not download dangerous software that promises free btc or invest in schemes that promise returns like cloud mining sites or ponzi schemes. 
4) Spend btc on sites like purse.io to save 20% off amazon(no digital items , just physical items) , but always rebuy more btc first with trusted exchanges like circle/kraken/bitstamp/.
5) Do not day trade , there is a high chance you will lose money. Just buy on a regular basis or set limit buy orders in to grab the dips and hold to accrue a nestegg.

If they don't than I welcome a split and want nothing to do with them .

@_date: 2017-07-12 15:38:39


This is a dishonest misrepresentation as to what is occurring. 
First of all, a majority of the hashrate already agreed to immediately activate segwit. 
Secondly, BIP148 was announced a very long time ago, openly. everyone has plenty of time to prepare. Miners have absolutely no obligation to service segwit to us after Aug 1st and we have no obligation to continue buying or using their product without segwit. 
Absolutely no blackmail or coercion involved here.

Altcoins sometimes get attacked but attacks naturally are focused on the coins with most value. If Dogecoin or ETH had the most value it would have worse scaling problems than bitcoin. It isn't just about attacks though but a direct result of popularity. Bitcoin has problems because it the most popular. 


All light wallets have different weaknesses and specific attack vectors, but to give you three examples of many:
1) light wallet creators update the software and just steal your private keys at any time. Bitcoin core doesn't self update , and goes through a careful and secure process of peer review and use of a Gitian process to compile the binaries. Also some light wallets aren't even open source either. 
2) Light clients cannot determine the difference between a block with valid txs and invalid ones. Miners could mine invalid blocks coupled with a inexpensive sybil attack and light clients could easily be double spent or accept txs for fake bitcoins 
3) Since HFs are the rage right now and Jihan is threatening activating BU which has no replay and reorg protection all light wallets that follow the heaviest chain that is forked would lose all of their value in event of a reorg. Bitcoin core would not because it actually validates the rules instead of blindly following the new chain and also allow the users to split the newly created coins to spend or use or dump on exchanges and there would be no risk from a reorg with a BU HF.


Removing a tx fee market and relying on miners setting min fees would be subject bitcoin to fee sniping attacks. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:31:44
thus the weight...
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:19:02
One miner to start , 15% bare minimum after a couple days, and 25% is better to insure no attacks
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:55:38


You have much different risk tolerances than I do. Bitcoin is not even being directly attacked by nation states at the moment and there will come a day when we will be . 


Nope, as I would need to catch up and sync to see the tx and confirmation which would take a very long time to do if I mostly kept it off. Are you even aware of how a full node works? Do you even run a full node?


Are you pulling those numbers out of thin air or can you back up these probabilities?


Huh? I just told you I am actively encouraging you to HF off and enjoy large blocks. No need to have me hold you back from a bloated UTXO set., be my guest. I will not attack your chain like others are threatening either, I will wish you luck with your centralization... and guess what? This choice will be available prepackaged and miner supported for you on aug 1st with BCC , so no more complaints , have fun.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:33:25

That is an extremely unlikely scenario being that most specialists have many concerns with Ext Blocks, and most users follow the specialists advice.

This HF proposal is 100% guaranteed to split the chain. UASF only has potential to split the chain. 


All those hashes are worth nothing if they don't support the users. 


We have seen those companies come and go , change their minds many times over, and  they will continue to do so... we cannot depend upon them for protocol advice especially when they have all reflected total ignorance to BIP141 and BIP 9 with this broken proposal. 
 
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:09:39
I disagree , A compromise forced on the community would hold bitcoin back by creating 2-3 coins and ruining bitcoins security. We need to push through with UASF at this time even if it takes 2-3 years. 
Nothing is personally holding you back from larger blocks . Change the limit today if you want. No one is stopping you.

@_date: 2017-05-23 20:53:22
Thanks for the Proposal Luke, I will maintain an objection to it for the following reasons:
1) No HF wishlist items included, It would be wise to include many aspects that can motivate most of the community in a HF , otherwise you will get too much of the community disagreeing or just not be motivated enough to upgrade their full nodes. 
2) 4-8MB blocks are too big for now, we need years for better network infrastructure to develop
3) We should gather more data with the very large blocksize increase segwit provides first and see how LN plays out before blindly jumping to a HF. 
I would not follow this HF even if 100% of devs supported it, 100% of businesses supported it, and 100% of miners supported it because it appears to me to be a political compromise instead of a genuine recommendation(I understand you don't endorse it)
HFs that might interest me involves permanent scaling solutions that are secure and account for externalties with several HF wishlist items included. I understand this may take years , but I am willing to wait. 
I appreciate your contributions regardless. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:33:49
Most wallets are already segwit ready, and the lower fees will drive a quick upgrade- 
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:24:50


Why would this question apply to me? I a promoting a solution that will raise the block limit to 4MB, and not even opposed to a future HF.
Are you really this confused or trying to mislead others with the myth that segwit doesn't increase the blocksize?
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:53:28
I am also concerned about consumer/payer fraud. Merchants already have a great incentive to refund because of reputation. If I purchase a product with bitcoin (gyft or purse.io) on amazon I have no problems returning it. It is in Amazons best interest to maintain a marketplace where consumers feel safe. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:06:12


Welcome to the reality of software . Not everyone is going to upgrade for various reasons. This is an unavoidable fact .


Yes, outdated software that behaves like a pseudo-SPV node with security. 


Huh? I want to validate my txs and won't be able to with blocks over 8MB in size, period. Bitcoin is p2pcash , if you remove peers validating txs and force them to depend upon third parties it is no longer peer 2 peer.


VPS hosted full nodes aren't anywhere as secure as home full nodes for myself or the network

@_date: 2017-05-23 19:15:59


Huh? This HF will definitely split the chain, I would never follow that proposal to start and many others feel the same. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:32:58


Not all HFs will split the chain and I am not opposed to all HFs. I am not even opposed to all splits and have been actively encouraging BU supporters to split immediately instead of complaining to no avail. 
I just won't follow such forks or splits. 


I can wait 1-2 years to gain more consensus with UASF if need be. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:14:47

@_date: 2017-05-25 17:34:40
Storage costs have always been the least of concerns with large blocks especially since pruning is available. 
The larger concerns in order are :
1) Bloated Growing UTXO set 
2) Block latency propagation 
3) Bandwith limitations worldwide based upon lack of infrastructure for a diverse set of validating nodes 
4) CPU and RAM to validate txs quickly enough 
5) hard drive storage costs 
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:47:20


It is none of my business if miners or users want to run BU . I can give them advice, discuss the technical tradeoffs , but it is their decision.


Users can already choose classic, XT, or BU to signal very large blocks. Core is not in charge , and just another choice. 
Additionally , what you would be doing is fooling those unfamiliar with sybil attacks that the majority of users want bigger blocks. Nodes can easily be sybil attacked so you could have 5% of real users who want 8MB blocks reflect 95% support in a fake vote. 


Miners should choose whats best for bitcoin and not play negotiation games. I won't
 
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:17:11

If those same miners are threatening to attack you and stalling segwit for the express purpose of undermining Pow by an exploit than they aren't really providing the security I need or want. 
The rational option is thus to first neutralize their threats by fixing the exploit with segwit and making PoW fair again, and if they don't follow this than we are better off not having them at all.

"The back ground of creation of Bitcoin is huge financial crisis." create by a centralized group that controls the currency.

No thanks, Jihan. The users ultimately control Bitcoin, not merely a cartel of miners.
Why we cannot have all nodes run in datacenters - 
1) In many countries all the datacenters exist in the capital city alone.
2) It is very simple for countries to pass one piece of regulation which would instantly place all datacenters under the same regulatory control where it will be trivial to get compliance from public and known businesses that will be forced to comply or be fined or prosecuted. This is not so easy with anonymous home nodes using TOR.

To understand why Ethereum is pointless is to understand that "Blockchains" are inefficient by design over traditional databases. The only reason you would or should have this adding inefficiency is for immutability (ETH is not that as we witnessed from the DAO) or censorship resistance.
One needs censorship resistance within bitcoin for message passing , timestamping, and value transfer. Most everything else can be accomplished with CSV, CLTV and Multisig. Why the hell would you need a world computer VM when currently there is no censorship risk for executing code (Is it really difficult to execute code on any server /computer right now?) and none foreseeable in the future? What possible application can ETH have besides creating ICO tokens to scam investors? Can you name one application or use case where an efficiency can be discovered or is possible?

There are many other security tradeoffs with running VPS nodes in general. I would suggest that running a dedi server(not VPS) in my own cage with good physical security in a country that respected property rights (not china) could get close to a home node(but not quite) in terms of security


Without fraud proofs spv nodes dont exist and you are now no longer using p2pcurrency. Only light nodes and psuedospv nodes exist and are far more insecure

Segwit is a permanent solution for scalability and tx malleability but not capacity. It is very important that segwit comes first because it makes adding more capacity much safer.

Compressed? Thrown away? 
Segwit doesn't make txs smaller or throw anything away. Sure you can prune off older signature data after you download them but we are discussing the size of blocks full nodes will have to download and relay. 
Since segwit relies on block weight we will see blocks being between almost none to 3.7MB with 1.9MB being average of full blocks once most nodes have upgraded. The theoretical limit will be 4MB but the largest blocks one will typically see is 3.7MB , so if you want to be anal you can suggest the "practical" limit will be 3.7MB after segwit.

Yes, which exactly my point . Most users are either unaware or don't have an informed opinion. These users are more likely to simply follow their oracles or specialists advice, just like we saw with the eth split where Vitalik and other eth devs convinced almost everyone to follow their chain. This isn't something that we should be proud of or desire as i would much rather have everyone being educated . In Bitcoins case it means that the frankensegwit8x HF has almost no chance of success. Many of these oracles and specialists also hold large quantities of BTC so their opinion isn't the only thing that will sway the markets but their action of dumping their loads of split coins on exchanges.

Great, in the whitepaper they are called "alerts" but are also refereed to as fraud proofs. They don't exist outside of one luke invented to allow SPV nodes the ability to ignore a chain that violates the blocksize limit shown here -

Unless you validate all blocks , up to 48MB in size, you are not running a full node and merely running a psuedo SPV. Those promoting ext blocks are misleading users into thinking this isn't the case. 


Are you aware of all the rules that full nodes validate besides signatures?
With segwit , it is just one(validating signatures) of the many rules that you cannot validate if you choose to not upgrade. With ext blocks it is far worse.

Sure ... people define things differently, but most anarchists and agorists are perfectly fine with ones right to refuse to buy a product or service and don't consider it coercion or breaking the NAP.


Those aren't the same thing. I would never block the entrance to a business because I don't like them or their product. I must respect the right of others to freely make up their mind and choose to use such a service or not. I also cannot prevent them from hearing both sides by filtering out their ability to visit other websites or forums to hear all sides of the issue as well. 
Thus I openly welcome others to educate themselves on all proposals and to freely choose to run any software they want and enforce any code they want. I will not block their ability to visit other sites , I will not attack their chain, I will not ddos their node, i will not perform a block withholding attack.  in fact I will go out of my way to help them find the product they want even if it is something I dont prefer myself.

It was 12 million ETHs given directly to them + 60 million premine with the cash given to them = 72 million premine
Ethereum is a premined scam.
1)	Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense  to the credulous. 
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.
Additionally, there are plenty of ICO's who have locked up Ethereum's and need to constantly sell them for fiat to pay for their burn rate going into next year which places a constant negative pressure on ETH price

interesting. I suppose the there is no need for denser high cost memory and one can simply use cheaper larger quantities of memory. The best mining fabs could make smaller appliances and the less advanced fabs could still sell larger uglier ASIcs . 
Thus the algo would start off mining on GPUs, than move to FPGAs+large amounts of memory for an extended period of time before ASICs
RAM is fairly cheap so it would be neat for computers to find improvements by simply upgrading ones RAM to 32GB or higher

Which is one reason why I support segwit which has 1.8-3.7MB blocks.
Keep in mind users don't want to dedicate 100% of their bandwidth to nodes , as they do use internet for other tasks as well when you run your calculations. 
There are many other concerns as well , such as the amount of RAM needed to support a large UTXO set and block propagation latency.

Not everything gets better with time. One of the largest concerns with the blocksize is bandwidth considerations.

This is false. Core isn't some monolithic entity but a diverse group of many developers. A few of these developers(Most core devs did not attend or agree) met with some miners to try and resolve scaling. They suggested they would code some HF proposals but absolutely did not and could not speak for other devs or core as a whole and cannot guarantee a HF would happen because they cannot speak for you or me. Within a couple weeks the miners broke the agreement but the core devs present coded up HF proposals anyways -

You are very unfamiliar with the security assumptions within bitcoin and risks of SPV nodes - 
Additionally, in situations of forks , running a full node enforcing the rules is all the more important as segwit2x is planing on ignoring the HF bit to try and trick spv nodes to follow it.


It is no longer peer to peer if you don't validate the rules yourself . You are trusting miners and a third party and the security assumptions are much different.

Then why not have 1-2 asics mining the testnet to prevent this embarrassment ?
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:40:55
miners follow profits and ETC started with much lower support and a mere 0.1% total hashrate
In the event of a split All this means is txs will be extremely slow on the 148 chain until difficulty readjusts and or it gets more hashrate.
This doesn't matter because in a split event there should be no txs occurring due to risk of 51% attack until the 148 chain can at least get 25% total hashrate or change the PoW.
Under such circumstances we do not need to perform a tx to split out coins(split coins through coinbase instead) and there will be an asymmetric advantage for the 148 chain due to many reasons:
1) 148 chain doesnt have the same reorg risk Legacy chain has
2) 148 chain will be able to tx and sell their legacy coins and re-invest in 148 easily and vice versa will be extremely difficult to do which places sell pressure on legacy chain.
3) The minority chain has more upside potential being attractive to investors looking to increase their BTC stake
Now analyze what the legacy chain has to do in the event of a split to protect themselves from reorg risk. They can either UASF with invalidateblock (not going to happen in the last minute as every node needs to upgrade ), or they can perform a HF at the last minute where 99% of economic nodes will reject their blocks and ban them instantly(doesn't look very good either).
Thus the option is either to risk losing everything with a massive reorg on legacy chain, activate segwit with a 148 border node on their pool(which they already agreed to do), or HF and create an alt few will accept.

Looks that way , but we shouldn't let our guard down yet , and need to work extra hard on getting more economic users running a 148 node before aug 1st.... If anything to prepare for the looming HF in 2-3 months as well. 
If UASF pulls this off than it is a historic moment and shows that users can prevent attacks from insiders at least. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:20:46
Many of us will not bother with 149, because we will welcome a split if miners don't keep their word and activate segwit safely before aug 1st. I personally will work on the 148 chain and sell all my split btc for the miner controlled chain. 149 is not an option for me regardless of what I like about BIP8 activation for future upgrades.
The game theory of 148 demands that enough users follow through and are honest with their intentions of staying the course. I will not switch my economic full node back regardless of the circumstances and would prefer an altspin off over the legacy chain if miners are so reckless to split.

Merchants and miners can follow the HF , best of luck to them, I will happily split my coins, dump the HF duplicated coins, and reinvest in the original chain, If the massive dumping of coins cannot convince 25% hashrate to return after 1-2 days , than a PoW change will be needed that we already have prepared.

Right, the entire purpose of BIP 148 is to convince the miners to follow through on there promise and activate with BIP91 or BIP141, not with 148 and not to split(although we are prepared for this consequence).


incorrect. It is impossible to bundle a Hf with a SF. There is absolutely no way to insure that a HF occurs in 2-3 months. These are merely promises made by 20% of the companies who signed the agreement. 


Or activate segwit and allow the HF to fail like all other attempts in the past. 


It is rather insane to accept the followup HF , based upon the fact that 99% of the economic nodes would instantly reject the blocks as invalid and ban the nodes. 
Miners can activate soft forks, but absolutely cannot impose HFs on the community, that takes every node upgrading.

To avoid clicking on any trash zine like coindesk here is the copy - 
In the race to build public blockchains empowered with self-executing code, at least two competing philosophies have emerged.
Ethereum has created a platform that makes it easy for developers to create nearly any type of smart contract that they want, while bitcoin has been added similar functionality at a much slower pace. But bitcoin developers like Lightning Network paper co-author Tadge Dryja argue there's a reason for adding smart contract functionality to bitcoin more cautiously.
During his work on the transaction-boosting technology Lightning Network, which he has been working on more recently at MIT, he came up with a method of adding some smart contract functionality to bitcoin in a way that he believes could preserve both privacy and scalability.
The idea behind Dryja's Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) is to try to keep the blockchain more decentralized.
Dryja told CoinDesk:


While onlookers often see the two cryptocurrencies as competitors, Dryja went on to argue that his idea may just be more practical as an engineering option in the long term.
"It has much lower impact on everyone else who uses the system, as the contracts take up very little [space] on the blockchain," he said.
**Bitcoin oracles**
Dryja's smart contract idea centers around a popular concept: oracles.
Some of the more complex and interesting smart contracts, as proposed, need the help of an outside data source. Oracles feed that data to smart contracts, which then execute based on the data that they receive.
Say that one user bets five ether that on Friday we will see over 80ºF weather. Two users set up a smart contract that specifies these conditions, and then select a data source that they both trust. (Maybe both users decide that theweather.com is the most trusted resource for timely temperature data.)
Next, the smart contract receives information from this source automatically on Friday. Whoever guesses the correct temperature range wins the five ether. Simple, right?
Ideas for how to do this in bitcoin already exist, but aren't widely used.
Dryja thinks that could be for a few reasons. One, these oracles need to be aware of users through the whole process, opening opportunities for the two to collude and game the system. Two, oracles will know which users are requesting data from them, which means that users that leverage the construction risk their privacy.
**Smart contract privacy**
That's where Dryja's idea comes in. The interesting part is that the oracle operator can't see if anyone is using the data it sends out.
"That's the lonely life of an oracle," he said. "You can't even tell if there was even a contract even after it happens. So that's kind of fun."
How does DLC accomplish that? At a high level, the oracle beams out data. (Say it sends out the temperature at a certain time each day.) This key will be mixed with data from the user before it is added to the blockchain.
Since the oracle's key is mixed with data that the oracle doesn't know about, the oracle can't tell if it was ever used and added to the bitcoin blockchain.
"We're going to combine the oracle's data with our own secret data, so we can recognize it but the oracle won’t recognize it," Dryja said.
He argued that the rationale for this level of privacy is that, more likely than not, companies using blockchain technologies don't want to reveal their financial records or a trail of the data they're using to the rest of the world.
DLC, like the ethereum project Town Crier, proposes one way of shielding some of the data.
**Oracle problems**
Besides privacy, oracles face some other tricky problems.
In general, oracles are trusted centralized services. Why does that matter? Remember, the smart contract is going to execute whether it's fed correct data or not. So, users need to "trust" that the service is sending reliable data.
Developers have proposed different ways of dealing with this point of centralization. Decentralized prediction market Augur, for example, plans to use a number of oracles at once to report an outcome.
Dryja doesn't think there's a way of eradicating the problem completely, though he has a couple of ideas for at least "mitigating" it. DLC aims to incentivize oracles to report the correct information. If an oracle dishonestly broadcasts different information to two smart contracts, for example, then the oracle's private key will automatically be revealed.
"Mathematically it works, but does it actually stop oracles from misreporting?" he said, adding that it will take more review to find out how well the idea stands up.
**SegWit, please?**
The idea is still a work in progress, but Dryja said that he's looking for more feedback from the community with the publication of a white paper on DLC.
For now, he hopes that his idea will help to inspire a new way of thinking about smart contracts; one that is more privacy and scalability focused. As far as next steps for the project, Dryja said that DLC will be his "next fun project" after he squares away some of the work he's doing on his version of the Lightning Network for MIT.
He noted that DLC does not require any changes to bitcoin, but it (like many others in the space) will work better when a coding optimization known as SegWit is activated on bitcoin – if it ever is.
He further said that it's possible to code up a version of DLC without SegWit, but it would be "annoying" to complete a version of the code that doesn't require SegWit's activation if SegWit is then activated soon after. So, he will likely wait for its activation to begin work on the project.

5) HFs are preferred over SFs crowd and should be done often

This is a problem because the community is currently divided and a capacity increasing HF at this time will definitely create 2-3 coins, market confusion, a huge loss of network effect , and a security nightmare.

Copy for those not wanting to click through to a trash zine like coindesk- 
Suppose you wanted to bet on the outcome of a future bitcoin hard fork, how would you go about doing that?
That very question came up last spring on BitcoinTalk when Roger Ver, the controversial investor and proponent of a particular brand of bitcoin scaling, gave a nod to a challenge from another investor. The wager? Which of two blockchains would be more valuable if bitcoin were to split.
The challenge sought to speculate on the future of Bitcoin Unlimited (BU), a proposal for removing the bitcoin block size limit. (This was before SegWit2x came into play, although both protocol upgrades propose bigger blocks and require a hard fork to implement.)
Intrigued by the bet, and the amount of money Ver was willing to put on the table ($120m-worth of bitcoin at the time), researchers Patrick McCorry at University College London and Ethan Heilman at Boston University, along with Andrew Miller, assistant professor at University of Illinois, put their heads together to figure out a solution.
And to that end, they have released a paper outlining the technical details needed to carry through with the wager.
The wager
Before explaining how that protocol works, though, let's go back to the bet.
Back in March, "Loaded," a pseudonymous investor who holds a substantial bag of bitcoins, put forth a challenge to Ver, who, at the time was pushing hard for BU.
" let's make a deal, 1 for 1 trade. At least 60k, possibly up to 130k, my BTU for your BTC," Loaded wrote
"The offer is open to [Bitmain CEO] Jihan Wu as well," he followed, noting the mining magnate Ver was said to be working closely with at the time. "Consider it primarily as a vote of no confidence in the Bitcoin Unlimited software and development team as it currently stands."
While Wu remained silent, two days later, to the surprise of many in the bitcoin community, Ver responded:
    "This sounds like a great deal for both of us. I look forward to ironing out the exact details and terms."
And, since then, the developer community has been kicking around ideas on how exactly to handle the technical details of the swap.
Adding to the urgency is an increasing likelihood that a hard fork could occur. Currently, 85% and 42% of miners are signaling their readiness for SegWit2x and Bitcoin Unlimited, respectively.
As in any hard fork, if the bitcoin blockchain splits into two competing networks, the result will be two types of digital assets, as well. So, in the case of a BU hard fork, a person holding bitcoin on the original chain would end up with an equal amount of BU bitcoin, or BTU, on the alternate chain.
Over time, those coins would develop different market values, depending on the chain more users gravitated to. The situation would be similar to the aftermath of ethereum's DAO hard fork, which resulted in two assets: ether and ether classic.
Technical challenge
To better understand the problem that McCorry, Heilman and Miller were striving to solve, it helps to take a closer look at how the deal between Loaded and Ver would unfold.
First, each party would need to put aside 60,000 BTC prior to the split. Once the split into two chains occurs, both parties will end up with coins on both blockchains, leaving each with 60,000 BTC and 60,000 BTU.
At that point, Loaded would trade 60,000 of his BTC on one chain with 60,000 of Roger's BTU on the other. Once the trade was completed, Loaded would walk away with 120,000 BTC and Roger with 120,000 BTU.
And, the gamble is, who will be the richer man as a result?
The scheme is a tough one to pull off, however. Although atomic cross-chain swaps are the most obvious way to handle the trade, that solution would only work after the hard fork when there would be two chains. Before the hard fork, there will only be one chain.
So, the trick is finding a way for both parties to commit to the trade prior the fork and then swap after the fork. And, because bitcoin has not yet activated the SegWit upgrade, the solution also needs to account for transaction malleability, a problem that adds several extra steps to the setup.
But Heilman and McCorry, who spoke to CoinDesk about their paper, said they've had a good time trying to arrive at a solution and see malleability as bringing more to the party.
"It's way more complicated, but it’s also more fun," said Heilman.
How it works
The solution set forth by the researchers is a modified version of an atomic swap protocol that relies on two bitcoin transaction encumbrances: CheckTimeLockVerify (CTLV) and hashlocks. CTLV sets transactions at a future point in time, while hashlocks require a "secret" (pre-image of a hash) to unlock a transaction output.
It's also worth noting that the protocol will work not just on a BU hard fork, but any hard fork that has what's called "replay protection," a way of ensuring that a transaction occurring on one blockchain after a split does not get repeated on the other.
Explaining the swap as it relates to Ver ('Alice') and Loaded ('Bob'), the setup goes something like this:
First, Alice computes a "secret" (pre-image) and hashes it. After that, three transactions (see below) need to be created and signed by both parties prior to the fork. This way, when the blockchain splits, Alice and Bob only have to broadcast their transactions to get their deposits.
Funding transaction
To commit to the trade, Alice and Bob each deposit 60,000 BTC into a "funding transaction." That transaction has three outputs.
One output is linked to Alice's coins, the other to Bob's coins, and a third acts as a fail-safe, allowing Bob to cancel if Alice neglects to sign any of the off-chain transactions required to set up the entire trade. To ensure the money is held safely until after the fork, each output has a time lock.
Now, with the money safely set aside, both parties can move on to add their digital signatures to two more transactions. These will determine how the money in the funding transaction will be spent after the fork.
Swap transaction
The "swap transaction" is actually a pair of transactions. When triggered, one transaction takes 120,000 BTU from the BU fork and sends it to Alice, while the other takes 120,000 BTC from the BTC  fork and sends it to Bob.
And, to ensure each transaction only works in its intended chain, the protocol calls on the replay protection already included in the hard fork protocol upgrade. This way, for instance, Alice cannot claim coins on both chains.
When the time comes, it will be up to Alice to trigger the swap. To claim her funds on the BU fork, she has to reveal the secret created at the beginning of the setup. And, with that secret, Bob is able to automatically (and atomically) grab all of his funds on the BTC fork.
But, there is a catch. Alice (who, once again, represents Ver) may decide to wait and see what the market is doing first. If the BU chain looks like it's not doing so well, she may renege, and not want go through with the trade after all. And, to guard against that, there is one more transaction to make.
Forfeit transaction
To give Alice an added incentive to "push the button," so to speak, a third "forfeit transaction" is also set up in advance. By signing the forfeit transaction, Alice grants all the coins to Bob in the event she does not trigger a swap.
So, essentially, the question posed at that theoretical point is: "What will it be, Alice? Do you want the lesser valued coins, or none of the coins?"
If Alice does not sign that transaction in advance, Bob will use the fail-safe set up in the funding transaction to cancel the entire deal, as Alice is not acting in good faith.
But once again, all of these transactions need to be setup and signed before the fork.
Place your bets
In the event of a BU hard fork, Ver, who has been pushing for bigger blocks for some time now, likely thinks the BU chain would come out on top. But, is he ready to stand by the deal he made with Loaded?
If so, McCorry and Heilman say they will be more than happy to set up the transaction. And, they feel confident other developers will pitch in to help out as well. So, with the stage set, all the players ready, what’s next looks like a wait-and-see game for now.
"Loaded asked the community for an atomic trade protocol suitable for the bet, and we have provided him with it," said McCorry.
Heilman added:
    "I'm not hoping for a bitcoin hard fork, but now, at least if it happens, we will have something to look forward to."

A hard fork done responsibly would be much slower than activating segwit 1.5-2 years at earliest. 
But they want a HF to activate in 30 to 60 days , if not instantly, which is very irresponsible. 


Here are some changes that must be done with a HF - 
Which is also why many of us oppose "Segwit+2MBHF"(misleading because it means 4-8MB blocks)  because it involves a lot of work and time for little payoff. When we hard fork we rather have a permanent solution to scaling like BIP103 or variation of flextrans, rolled out in a responsible manner like spoon-net , and with as many HF wishlist items as we can do. It should be well tested with contingency plans in place. 
B Unlimited(EC) is not only fundamentally broken but offers no replay, wipeout, and reorg protection whish is why its support is so low -

If we desired to be malicious to the majority of Miners we would act very differently than 148 UASF. I am not going to discuss the many options we could take because I don't want others to misinterpret my intentions as threatening in the slightest.

This is factually untrue the legacy chain(or "original bitcoin chain" if you prefer) can remain technically.


It is written to free us, and only us , from a standstill.... any status quo, SFs, and Hfs, that occur thereafter are completely up to the parties involved. It is trivial for miners to SF in an invalidateblock to keep the status quo on their chain if they so desire as well with a majority of hashrate. 
It is odd that you are suggesting that miners are being coerced into activating segwit when a majority of them already agreed to immediately activate it. If any miners do not want segwit I encourage them to either SF or HF to protect themselves against reorg risks and actively encourage them not to see the 148 chain as a threat. We will respect their chain and have no desire to attack it

Spending does not increase bitcoins value but likely decreases it because most merchants instantly convert it to fiat. Price appreciation goes up with supply and demand on exchanges. Therefore people buying bitcoin while either inflation going down or less selling means the price goes up and the more that hold during this process the more scarcity exists driving the price up.
FYI- I use and spend bitcoin daily , just make sure I always buy more btc than I spend.

2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time noobs are misled into believing ETH is decentralized.

You don't seem to understand this has absolutely nothing to do with a single HF or an 8MB limit. 
This has to do with either the users controlling bitcoin through UASF upgrades or corporations/miners imposing changes top down on the community. 
Under no circumstances should one give up their principles , especially with something as pointless as what is being proposed . It will not stop at 8MB , this will set a precedence for 16, 32 , .... ect HF over and over again as Gavin originally wanted.

@_date: 2017-07-17 14:37:13
Like we saw during the Eth split , these sorts of splits tend to create both volatility and more fiat pouring into the ecosystem due to speculation battles , thus the cumulative value is usually higher as different chains attract different ideologies and demos and a trading battle attracts fresh fiat to exchanges
Immediately after ETH split the cumulative value was higher regardless of the price drop on the main chain. 
This doesn't mean a split is desirable longterm, but parking your money in litecoin isn't a wise thing to do either.

1) Consider more secure means of backing up your 12 or 24 BIP39 backups in case of floods or fire -  Or  or  or  or  Use steel , brass, or copper or other durable metals. Wood and aluminum are unacceptable.
2) Keeping that backup safe and private
3) Use a passphrase with the hardware wallet (most the security concerns with HW wallets are solved with a passphrase.) Make sure the passphrase is also secured in laminated paper or metal because if you forget this than even with the 12/24 words you will lose your Bitcoin.
4) Order your ledger or trezor directly from the company (supply chain attack concerns)-
Check for authenticity - 
Than upgrade the firmware, backup the 12/24 BIP 39 words, than send a small amount of BTC to it, than reset and restore the hardware wallet making sure the BIP39 words never get entered in to a computer or stored digitally(you should be only getting the words and typing them into your hardware wallet and paper/metal backups), Once your restored the wallet and see the tx and BTC you can feel confident and have experience in event you lose/damage your HW wallet and than can send a larger amount of Bitcoin to it.

More stable could simply mean 9.8% returns averaged per year . Which means that people simply save money for 10-20 years before buying a home instead of 4 years. Renting in the interim is always a good option, especially in the younger years when moving for new jobs is more common. This likely won't happen for 20+ years as Bitcoin has a long way to go before becoming more stable.

Coinbase grossly overcharges for onchain fees , avoid that wallet , many of us are paying less than 10 cents per tx onchain and less than a penny on lightning. Go here for more help- r/BitcoinBeginners/
The correlation between larger txs(thus larger tx fees) has more to do with dust (you received many small txs into your wallet instead of a single one) and nothing to do with the value of the tx directly (although very valuable txs typically are larger because they need to cover multiple inputs to fund the total amount, but not necessarily)
Thus a tx of 1 million usd in BTC can technically have a lower tx fee (because the weight/size is smaller ) than a BTc tx worth 50 USD (because its filled with dust)
Here is some advice:
1) Batching when you can (electrum has sentomany built in )
2) send from native bech32 segwit addresses (your BTC address starts with bc1)
3) Follow the fee market and manually set thee right priority 
4) Make sure you use a wallet that uses RBF (Replace by fee) so you can easily bump the fee if need be. Examples are Bitcoin core, electrum, blockstream green, Samourai so you can set the fee very low manually and than bump it up as needed
More info - 
5) Where possible use lightning wallets and transactions which have fees below 1 penny USD -

If you aren't going to get a trezor or ledger (recommended) than these wallets are better-
**Best Advanced Bitcoin Wallet= Bitcoin Core**
Pros= Great privacy and security 
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires ~5GB minimum disk space if prunned
**Best High Privacy Bitcoin Wallet = Wasabi**
Pros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in 
Cons= mixing coins costs more fees 
**Best wallets for securing small amounts of BTC**
**electrum** For Desktop and Android
Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control 
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets
**Samourai Wallet** For Android
Pros- Advanced Privacy features 
Cons- UX suffers due to lack of Fiat value displayed
**Éclair** LN wallet for Android and desktop
Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees
Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental ,Some users may want to use other LN wallets. 
**hodlwallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Much better UX than other wallets and slick look as it’s a fork of the original Bread wallet
Cons- lacks some privacy features found in electrum and samourai
**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration and advanced 2fa options
Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers.

Thus in 2026 we will be able to confirm these estimates and gather more useful data needed for asteroid mining.

Valid concerns. If Covert ASICBOOST is occurring as evidence indicates it has been disastrous towards bitcoin creating mining centralization causing multiple ASIC manufactures to go out of business and multiple farms to shutdown. 
This vulnerability - 
undermines bitcoins security and segwit is a big step in the direction to neutralize the negative effects of covert AB because it makes miners participating in this practice restricted to 1MB blocks making their actions more apparent and allows other miners to make up for the 20% disadvantage with collecting more fees from mining 1.8-3.7MB blocks.

xn. I admit some graft-craft there in choosing 2,3 which happens to put the tying point right at 0.25. :P 1,2 - 2,1 put it anywhere between .2 and .3 --- and the exact crossover is subjective because utxo cost and block storage costs are not equally 'expensive' but depend on user tolerances, hardware arch, etc. The key point is that the derivitive of the red line is a -1/x^2 like curve, that

has a knee right at .2, so a witness factor smaller that that has an increasingly large bloat effect while only linear capacity and utxo bloat mitigation.
8:25 am
probably anywhere between .2 and .3 would have been fine, .25 is in the middle. There are a bunch of parameters in Bitcoin where the exact figure doesn't really matter, but it's more or less in the middle of a sensible range, and setting far outside of that range would work less well or not at all.
8:26 am
of all the designs that have been discussed that tried to do something about the utxo bad incentives, segwit had the important property of having only a single parameter which had a naturally constrained range of sensible values.

I never said this . I said 4MB limit and have often said that average blocks will likely be around 1.9 to 2.1MB when most wallets have migrated over to segwit


No I said I am open to HF proposals , repeatedly. 


2-4MB blocks is the maximum we need now and will cause enough damage by radically increasing the blocksize when we already are far too centralized. 4-8MB blocks are too big. If it wasn't for UTXO re balancing I would be happier with no blocksize increase and just a fix to malleability so we can test LN out before increasing the blocksize.

Because a majority of the hashrate already agreed to activate segwit immediately and BIP91 makes 148 compatible therefore no split will occur. 
Are you suggesting I should assume bad faith with most of the miners? If so than we should split as we have bigger problems at hand. 


This is false. You do not need to run a 148 node and will be perfectly safe running a standard core node even after aug 1st. There is no action you need to take. If the miners act maliciously and break their word than that can happen anytime with or without 148.


Think of it as a relationship where one party is unhappy but also is deeply empathetic towards the other party so gives a notice many months in advance they will be leaving if the other party doesn't live up to their promise they have made.

personally I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi/samourai) than the base layer because:
1) The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical
2) I want to use a coin where people can choose to be transparent or private
3) In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
4) Placing tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs


Yes, and this is easy to do as most of them merge in discarded BTC proposals or merge in Bitcoin core work prematurely without testing (like BCH is doing with schonrr sigs)


I have a deep knowledge of the individual devs working on altcoins, their history of scamming others, their work, and I occasionally will review their code and test their implementations.
This goes for all the larger cryptocurrency projects from 2012 onwards, so am lacking on many details of thousands of alts but anything in the top 15 at anytime after 2012(many have come and gone)  I have at least some knowledge of. The most prolific scammer is Dan Larimer as he keeps creating scams, pumping them and dumping them and moving onto the next project. Vitalik is another example. 


Altcoins typically have a "move fast and break things attitude" but often they are moving fast on other peoples discarded work that was deemed unsuitable or untested work. Not something wise for fintech

No one is forcing you to run a full node. You can choose to be less secure if you want and not use p2p cash by trusting a third party. I hope that you properly educate the merchants and users of the risks associated with running SPV , but I get a sense you are unaware of them yourself.

SPV wallets have their place but bitcoin ceases to be p2p with SPV wallets because you are dependent upon trusting a third party. The Title of the whitepaper is "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". You are no longer p2p if you need a third party for validation. Remember that full nodes validate and can reject txs from miners thus payments from one full node to another is p2p. I suggest more full nodes, pruned nodes, and SPV clients as they all have their advantages and tradeoffs.

Fiat isn't useless regardless of its shortcomings either, but most of the security that underlies bitcoin would be removed if it was no longer p2pcash.

Its much worse than this as most gold is "paper gold" that likely doesn't exist.


Fake gold coins are flooding the market as well


Unless you are willing to damage these coins or have an expensive ultrasound machine , the normal tests will not work as the outside is gold and tungsten weighs very similar to gold. 


Gold is an element so will always have some value like in certain forms of jewelry or to dope carbon nanotubes and other industrial use cases. It simply will continue losing its value as a currency, speculation tool, and reserve asset. Remember that at one time Aluminum was far more valuable than gold.

To start Ethereum is a scam - 
 
and 99% of altcoins are scams
Also we should discourage most users from day trading because of - 
Don't daytrade cryptocurrencies and don't listen to advisors who manipulate you into daytrading as well, they tend to act as oracles and then use that asynchronous info to manipulate the markets.
	
There are whales and traders with asynchronous advantages over you so you are at a disadvantage and will likely lose money day trading
Day traders find that they become obsessed with checking the price and end up spending most of their productive time looking at charts instead of working for a salary.
Also you will be exposed to a lot of capital gains taxes and complexity vs just buying and holding for long term investment. Every single time you make a trade between each asset is a taxable event and tracked and reported on an exchange.
Day trading also forces you to store your BTC on exchanges which is very dangerous
At most use an exchange as a means to set buy limit order to automate buying on dips and than withdraw for longer term investing, but immediately withdraw your BTC from exchanges after buying
For most people the only advantage they have is patience and long time preference over those that are greedy and impatient.
For day traders this is the general order of who has the most control and therefore an unfair advantage over you (or why you will likely lose money)
1)	Creator(s) who developed the coin with a massive premine or instamine. This does not apply to Bitcoin because Bitcoin is 100% PoW and has way too many developers with no one in control but does apply to most altcoins. They directly make changes or can leave the project for others so have inside knowledge and can manipulate the market. Their massive premine/instamine can also allow them to easily pump and dump the market like a mega-whale.
2) Exchanges and employees of an exchange get more market information than any trader, often manipulate the market to profit off of others in many ways, insider trade, and are often massive whales themselves because many altcoins bribe them with a massive premine to get listed.
3) Whales or Very large investors - have an advantage because they are more capable of creating bear or bull traps with coordinated fake media campaigns
4) Oracles , boiler room trading advisers - These are the classic pump groups that you find on telegram and elsewhere where they will get a large group of investors to buy in on something while they make trades against them at the last moment. The investor see's the coin blowing up so think the advice given was right and than the coin crashes in value and they are left holding the bag and blaming themselves because they think they didn't get out soon enough when the cards were stacked against them from the very beginning
5) Professional day traders who spend 50-60 hours a week trading and researching. These people have a slight advantage over the typical trader because they know more due to their efforts.
6) Amateur day trader (or you) with the least amount of information of the group and all the disadvantageous
Of course you can make a profit with luck but the odds are stacked against you and its more akin to gambling in a casino where the longer your play, the more likely you are to lose money.
Unless you decide to invest the effort in becoming a professional the Best advice is not to play, and use the single advantage that you do have - long time preference and patience over those that are greedy and impatient.

Liquidity refers to how easy an asset or currency can used, bought or sold in the market at a price reflecting its intrinsic value.
Cash is usually a substitute for this as USD is a very liquid currency, but if you can spend your BTC easily or sell it for gold without much slippage than it is also a reflection of liquidity. 


No, Fiat is a form of registered value. Bitcoin is a bearer asset. Completely different categories with different properties. Anyone that claims BTC will replace fiat in our lifetimes is simply delusional and lacks an understanding of how effective "Proof of Violence" is and what are some of the benefits of registered value.
 At most Bitcoin will simply eat away a certain % marketshare of fiat and gold and other investments like stocks. 


Bitcoin has a very long way to go to become the reserve currency of the world like the USD, but perhaps may one day get there. This doesn't mean fiat currency is going away

2) Many users are withdrawing funds due to the hack further testing if they were fractional this whole time

After all the insolvent exchanges, hacks, exit scams people should be very skeptical about letting other strangers borrow their bearer assets , especially with how little regulation exists on these types of exchanges

Looks like a slow roll out. I believe part of the delay may have been for marketing reasons as they wanted to see an end to the bear market before marketing Bitcoin.
This is not derrivative trading of Bitcoin or cash settled trading but full cold storage custody Bitcoin buying aimed at institutional buyers . 
This means that they need to buy BTC on the open market or with OTC trades to fulfill these trades and these buyers will likely be long term hodlers.
Looks like they will launch just with Bitcoin as well.

cash app is a great option
otherwise coinbase pro, bitstamp, gemini


The cheapest way to buy BTC is with either coinbase pro or cash app. With coinbase pro there are no fees with buy limit orders and with cash app there are no fees either (both just profit on the spread)


yes , but that isn't wise as paypal isn't very secure and thus fees will be much higher. Better to just link a bank acct to your paypal and than transfer your balance to your bank account. Once the fiat is in your bank account than you can ACH it for free to cash app or coinbase pro

Do not daytrade
Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 
Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

**Best Advanced Bitcoin Wallet= Bitcoin Core**
Pros= Great privacy and security 
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires ~5GB minimum disk space if prunned
**Best High Privacy Bitcoin Wallet = Wasabi**
Pros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in 
Cons= mixing coins costs more fees 
**Best wallets for securing small amounts of BTC**
**electrum** For Desktop and Android
Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control 
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets
**Samourai Wallet** For Android
Pros- Advanced Privacy features 
Cons- UX suffers due to lack of Fiat value displayed
**Éclair** LN wallet for Android and desktop
Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees
Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental ,Some users may want to use other LN wallets. 
**hodlwallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Much better UX than other wallets and slick look as it’s a fork of the original Bread wallet
Cons- lacks some privacy features found in electrum and samourai
**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet
Pros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration and advanced 2fa options
Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers. 
**Securing Larger amounts of Bitcoin (1k USD and more)**
**ledger nano S wallet** = ~69 USD
**trezor one wallet** = ~78 USD
**Trezor Model T** = ~169 USD

Here is a breakdown of the power dynamics in bitcoin when it comes to the rules of the protocol.
Ultimately economic users hold the most power.
**Miners** have invested a lot in infrastructure , but have tight margins and typically have electrical and rental contracts where they cannot afford to mine coins that are unprofitable for long due to the community rejecting it. 
Miners role is in ordering transactions and economic full nodes validate the rules.
**exchanges** Have a lot of influence upon the naming of tokens or at least their ticker and act as somewhat of a large investor. This is another reason among many that we advise you to store your BTC yourself because we want users to be in control and not large centralized exchanges. They can also help predict an outcome of a split with future trading pairs. 
**Merchants and payment processors** give legitimacy to a chain , increase its network effect and influence more users to use that chain in the long term
**Developers, specialists and Oracles**  They cannot force code upon the users and since nodes don't self update economic users can reject their proposals with as little as inaction. These people indirectly influence economic users indirectly because the whole ecosystem depends upon them for security fixes and updates. Many developers are extremely large stakeholders due to being involved in Bitcoin since 2010 and 2011. 
**economic Users** have the most control. Ones that validate the rules with a full node cannot be coerced into new rules even with 100% of hashpower deciding upon something. Since miners have such high overhead they will typically quickly follow the lead of these users because they buy their product and it is quite costly to ignore their wishes. 
Not all economic users are equal however and there are different types of economic users. 
1) **Spenders** tend to use bitcoin for its utility and buy it just to spend instead of long term investment. These cannot influence HF split outcomes much because they typically do not have many BTC at any given time thus aren't awarded many BTC split tokens to wield their influence with
2) **Hodlers / Investors** These individuals have a great power and there are approximately ~70 large whales in our ecosystem who have between 10,000 and 100k BTC . Since they are given both sides of the coin in HF they can quickly determine the outcome in a speculation war . These people tend to be conservative IMHO with scaling as they have greatly profited from the years of stability and have a lot to risk by any proposal that damages bitcoins key characteristics or security. With every passing year the amount of large whales will drop and BTC will become more evenly distributed.
In reality we want bitcoiners to be both spenders and investors and there is a spectrum in the two above with how much one fits in each category

There is practically no risk for the UASF chain as long as we maintain above 25% hashrate. If we dip below that than simply won't transact until we get more hashrate or change the PoW algo and have sufficient security in place. The majority hash chain has to be very careful with attacking or they will reorg or can be attacked themselves.

It is a soft fork to remain backwards compatible with many other people and implementations/proposals. FYI - 148 is now compatible with frakensegwit8x proposal due to BIP91. Your concern with a SF vs HF applies to all SFs in general in such a case. Especially since miners can SF in reorg/wipeout protection with a simple SF like invalidateblock. Since this isn't a surprise , last minute SF flag day than others have plenty of time to prepare to not follow 148 safely.

This would indeed temp. hurt Bitcoin as it would dry up liquidity , its also very dangerous for governments to do this as it reflects which ones are totalitarian in nature and would create distrust among many citizens. I think this is unlikely to occur at least for BTC because:
1) BTC isn't a privacy coin , Privacy happens on other layers or client side on the wallet giving it plausible deniability for exchanges to sell it and do their AML/KYC due diligence with coinanalytics regardless how easy it is too break. Stupid criminals will be arrested still. 
2) Many large banks and millionares already are invested in BTC or supporting selling or trading BTC , gen z and millennials prefer crypto over precious metals and stocks so they are too greedy to not profit of gamblers day trading BTC

I think the turning point for most people will be when 90% of businesses accept BTC directly and they see little BTC logos next to every VISA and Mastercard logo in most stores. At this stage they will be forced to stop calling it a scam and at this stage most the speculative investing will be over and people will just use BTC as a currency that very slowly appreciates in a stable manner. 
Unfortunately, besides a small group of early adopters and crypto-anarchists , I don't think there will be as dramatic of a shift in power or financial wealth as many believe. The millionares and billionaires (even some that dislike BTC) are the ones that will be buying the most now and in the next 6 years by allocating a very modest allotment of their portfolio 0.5-1% in BTC, thus hedging their investments and joining us into the future.

Gold used to be great as a hedge , and an uncoorelated asset class against stocks and bonds. Now there are better assets than gold for this purpose. This doesn't mean that gold will overnight lose its value , due to the lindy effect I expect gold to remain valuable as a good SoV for some time period , It will just slowly lose relevance, and only when asteroid mining becomes more prominent it can quickly drop in value as we saw with aluminum. 


Agreed, Bitcoin is riskier than gold for the time being. Thus one should allocate a smaller % of their portfolio to BTC to hedge against this risk. This could quickly change once asteroid mining becomes popular however.

this is actually a reasonable argument to buy some gold coins as long as you can secure them yourself and ultrasound test them as a lot of fake gold is around. Gold is an uncorrelated asset to Bitcoin and stocks so you have a more secure and diversified portfolio with exposure to it even though I expect its returns to continue to get worse in time as BTC continues to eat its marketshare.

You can withdraw for free from coinbase pro, move BTc from coinbase to coinbase pro for free with deposit button and than withdraw if you accidentally bought them on coinbase. 
Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.** 


If you are buying over 1k USd of BTC get a HW wallet. Ledger or trezor. 
The most secure , "active" wallet would be a hardware wallet integrated with a full node . One way to do this easily is to run your own electrum server       and than integrate electrum wallet with your HW wallet and connect to your electrum server.

This is not the topic at hand and not the reason coinbase banned him. I am not a fan of him, but you know as well as I do why he is so much more hated than anyone in the KKK or skinhead(what few of them are left). He is hated so much because he is popular among young people and an educated, gay, jewish man with a black husband so is immune from most of the identity political attacks that some use to attack their enemies 
If banks want to start banning popular conservatives, than great, all the better they benefit from Bitcoin. I recommend to conservatives to start leaving those banks immediately to ones that don't attack their kin. 
If  airlines, railroads, bus lines, taxicab companies, phone companies, internet service providers, cruise ships, motor carriers, freight companies, social media platforms want to start deplatforming people for political reasons than this is something else entirely as they are protected under common carrier status in the USA so are not allowed to do this.

incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls based on allowing miners
to produce larger blocks at some cost. These proposals help preserve
the alignment of incentives between miners and general node operators,

now capacity is high enough and the needed capacity is low enough that

Tx fees exist specifically for DDOS/spam protection along with the blocksize limit. This is one of the fundamental innovations of bitcoin . Inefficiently Burning registered value to create fungible value for censorship resistance from attacks (including DDOS attacks). Without tx fees what is going to stop an attacker from blocking everyones txs by having a server send the same btc back and forth thousands of time per minute?


I am sorry to believe that you have been misled into believing that light clients are secure. The bitcoin whitepaper described SPV nodes with alerts or fraud proofs . Unfortunately those were never developed so we are left with far more insecure pseudo-SPV nodes that have many more attack vectors than full nodes because they don't verify most of the rules and their trust model is based principally on the altruism of the wallet developers or servers you connect to. The truth is you can be completely fleeced with running a light node or web wallet.

IMHO a split is unlikely to occur on aug1st + we had a small correction so it is a perfect time to buy as the markets will rally with a new scaling solution and some uncertainty to bitcoin scaling being answered.
Keep in mind that the signers of the segwit2x proposal (most miners and 20% of the companies) have made segwit2x compatible with 148 if they activate before aug1.
Lets examine a split scenario if segwit isn't activated on or before aug 1 though=
A split occurs , the price of both coins dramatically drops , but since you don't do anything as silly as store your btc on a web wallet or exchange you have both sides of the split. It is likely that the cumulative value of both sides to be higher like we saw with the ETH split in the short term so you are fine and can either hold onto both or sell off part or all of one side without a loss.

2026 is when NASA's probe intercepts with Psyche so it will necessarily have to be after 2026 
Keep in mind that as soon as this probe changes NASA's estimates to real numbers the market will start to price in this expected flood even before delivery. Most of golds value , like bitcoin is speculative and based upon the assumption of scarcity with asteroid mining not priced in for the most part

Sure, but oracles and whales will often use their leverage to manipulate these coordinated pumps.
 &gt;And as long as demand stayed high so would the price.
Great. Just keep buying and using BTC. These coordinated pumps have a negative effect because it looks desperate and scammy like we are trying to pump the price like many boiler rooms do with ICO's and shitcoins. Bitcoin is better than that. We have long term time preferences. I will not wait to buy BTC , but buy it when I can, as soon, as I can as often as I can, because I understand its utility and scarcity.

Mining will always remain profitable because humans need resources and the costs to mine on planets  and than export them to space is much higher than asteroid mining, and for people living in space it will be more profitable to mine than on earth so there is no reason to believe we will not be mining asteroids in the future.

uasf148 should encourage people to buy BTC if anything as it brings to close stagnation. Even in the worst scenarios where BTC splits it would be wise to buy BTC now, because a speculation war between both factions will bring more fiat in to each side, and the total price of both coins combined will likely be higher.

I wouldn't be so sure of that, many old users and devs have large amounts of bitcoins and most these companies are bleeding through their VC capital with a high burn rate, thus the desperation to grow quickly before their funds evaporate by offloading security and node costs on the community.

Coinbase has fdic insurance on their fiat side for US customers , and supposedly some insurance on their btc hot wallet but cannot be trusted to keep the BTC for many reasons listed below. So when you buy , immediately withdraw unless its a very small amount . Coinbase pro pays your onchain tx fee so no valid reason not to withdraw
Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

Seems like a ponzi scheme. All my life I was told to not hoard my fiat under my mattress and now they are telling me to?
I can understand having a few hundred or thousand laying around to avoid ATM fees and for convenience, but hoarding fiat outside of banks is absurd .... If I needed to hoard that much than the likely reason would be some economic crisis that would devalue said fiat. Plus fiat is difficult to transport and dogs can smell it for states to steal. Asset Forfeiture is very common nowadays where you are guilty until proven innocent even for very small amounts of fiat like 1k USD and up. Much safer to hoard BTC as a hedge.

here is a comprehensive analysis- 
**Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro vs Cash App** 
All these companies are insured and very easy to setup and verify with great UX. Due to its simplicity Cash App is a little easier to use out of the 3. All these methods require AML/KYC verification, cash app delays this until you withdraw the BTC.
**Pros**-- Easier to Use than coinbase pro. Allows you to lock in a price (but have to wait ~1 week) for BTC to be released which is helpful during a bull market.  
Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading=  ~1 week delay on withdrawing Bitcoin, more complex to use than cash app, highest fees with 1.49 % bank transfer and 3.99% debit card fees, overcharges on withdrawal fees or onchain transactions 
**Pros**-- Lowest fees of the 3 when you use a buy limit order = 0.15%, unlike coinbase pays for your onchain withdrawal fee(But the week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on fiat arriving preventing buying can make you lose BTC unlike the other 2)
Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting scams and insider trading=  ~1 week delay(~2 days SEPA in EU) on depositing fiat with bank transfers before you can buy BTC, most complex to use of all 3
**Square Cash App**
**Pros**-- Easiest to use of the 3, Best alignment with Bitcoin politically, Allows you to lock in the price immediately and withdraw quickly(once verified), No fees to buy Bitcoin or withdraw bitcoin
**Cons**-- Only available in USA, No way to send BTC to cash app to to sell thus once you withdraw you have to sell elsewhere, despite having no fees their spread is slightly wider thus making them slightly more expensive that coinbase pro typically
Here is a complex price analysis comparing cash app to Coinbase, to coinbase pro I did a while ago.
So lets assume a 100 USD as a typical transaction for most. So when I do this on cash app I get 5295.75, and on coinbase pro I get 5236 (100-0.15%) so 0.01888 btc cash app 0.01906 coinbase pro = 0.00018 BTC difference or 94 cents higher on cash app ... but also keep in mind that cash app lets you instantly purchase BTC with a deposit showing instantly where you lock in the rate like coinbase which has a 1.49% fee instead of waiting 1 week so a better comparison would be 5227 (100-1.49%) =0.01884 BTC so cash app actually has lower fees in this regards.
Thus , if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar , but also likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount in a bull market.
Good idea to setup an account with either "Cash app and coinbase pro" or "gemini and cash app" if you are in the USA. Unless you live outside the USA , you should never use regular coinbase due to the fees. 
Use cash app during a bull market where you need to instantly lock in the price. Perhaps use coinbase pro in a Bear market where the delay won't hurt you or if you need to sell some Bitcoin.
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys. After buying your bitcoin withdraw them to your personal wallet**

Well said, Sir!
Also this encourages people to use wallets like wasabi to coinjoin by reducing tx weight in coinjoins , thus reducing fees for coinjoins.
In addition this would allow 17% to 40% more tx space in blocks(with signature aggregation as schnorr alone doesn't do this, 
 just allows for this) without increasing the resource demands on nodes like raising the blocksize limit does.

The ineptitude and limited size of the gvt basically means they don't interfere with families.


22s are lethal. Yes, carrying is indeed guaranteed if you pass a background check and either a citizen or permanent resident. It does take around 5-6 years to become a permanent resident though. Taxes are extremely inexpensive. I have a ton of acres and multiple houses and pay around 800 dollars a year in property taxes. AK47s arent legal though , but most rifles , shotguns , and guns are sold here
As far as guns are concerned many have them illegally in their home... you just don't want to carry them around until they are illegal. "4th and 5th" amendment rights are sometimes better here than in the US I have seen. 
Crime is mostly petty theft, you just need to design your home secure and not leave a laptop on the beach. Ticos are very friendly and nonviolent peaceful people. We dont have many murders or kidnappings like I see in mexico or other latin american countries and much safer than FL.

ETH and ICOs fulfill the Howey test checklist thus they are considered illegal securities as briefly summarized below- 
   1)    It is an investment of money (Money(fiat or btc) is used to buy ETH and ICO tokens - (yes, courts have suggested bitcoin is money regardless of the IRS treating btc as an asset)
   2) There is an expectation of profits from the investment (Disclaimers don't work here. What does implicate a project is any promotion of the token that leads an investor to believe they can profit)
   3) The investment of money is in a common enterprise (Ethereum foundation being setup in Switzerland doesn't protect them. If they have merely one 1 US investor they are breaking security law and the ETh foundation had a 72 million premine sold that they controlled and have exhibited many instances of control like during the DAO fiasco. Bitcoin doesn't have this problem because it is pure PoW.
   4) Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party- ICOs and Ethereum foundation certainly promote these illegal securities

nope, never suggested this. it is a real risk that the legacy chain will have to address with either a SF(invalidateblock) or HF. If they HF they will instantly get banned by most nodes, If the SF they will fix their wipeout risk but than replay issues become a thing of the past and they permanently split the chains. 
I don't pretend to know how this will play out , and don't really care one way or another as it won't deter me from a PoW algo change , or creating an alt as I have stated many times in the past.

Most "poor" people in the USA aren't really poor by world standards, however and most can still afford to run a full node. I travel a lot and live in a country where 2-4Mbps down is considered fast so yes, if blocksize increases too fast than there may be whole regions of the world that cannot run full nodes and thus remove one of the principle purposes of bitcoin to be p2p instead of trusting third parties.

Gold has far less Acceptability than BTC for merchants
Gold is far less Scarce than BTC
Gold is more difficult to validate vs BTC
Gold is currently less volatile than BTC
Thus Gold only beats Bitcoin in one characteristic of a good currency for the time being

Pretty clear that you have little to no security if you are your own insurer that can either be hacked during the attack or internal theft occurs.

The same thing can be said about Bitcoin, as I am very harsh to any Bitcoin supporters who give delusional expectations of Bitcoin to others and not describe all the limitations in Bitcoin like I do. 
Are you suggesting that it is impossible to distill the fact that there was a 72 million premine with ethereum and that the creators broke many promises and were involved in other scams before hand?

Bitcoin isn't principally dependent upon our philosophical will or social desire for some political outcome. Evidence suggest that cypherpunks, crypto-anarchists and libertarians make a small fraction of bitcoin investors, miners, and users(I would suggest , less than 1/3rd) 
The game theory system of incentives sets up a scenario where the market can use a secure platform to pay a premium for fungibility which is very valuable in society and has a feedback loop of investment in which the only dependency needed is individual self interest to secure and grow the ecosystem.

Reflects over 96% support core. 
In reality I believe that most BTC users are ignorant to the debate and don't have much of a well established opinion so will likely (for good and bad consequences) just follow their oracles advice. Thus this favors core and segwit alone as more popular oracles and more of them support segwit but not segwit2x. 
Are evenly split or neutral, but are salivating over the possibility of profiting during a coin split 
Most hashrate supports segwit2x but miners follow profits and likely will switch to the more profitable chain
**Devs** 
Almost all devs support segwit and think segwit2x is a joke or dangerous  
**Bitcoin Businesses**
87% raw support segwit, 82% weighted support segwit 
20% raw support segwit2x , 48% weighted support segwit2x
Thus IMHO , based upon the data above , any HF attempt in 3 month will guarantee a split with 2 surviving chains. If that is what segwit2x supporters want , than so be it.

LN addresses are different , thus there is no confusion between the 2 txs.
Alice scans or copy and pastes the address and clicks send for 5 BTC in a LN wallet. There is no confusion on her part and she doesn't need to worry if they have a LN node or not. The only difference is she will pay a higher on the chain tx fee if the tx is onchain.
Perhaps what you may see is a little icon indicating LN ready on the merchants checkout so the clients knows that the tx fee is little... but if they don't understand the icon , that is not a big deal as they are in the same exact situation as they have today with higher fees

Sure, lets not add to them and address the real negatives. One of the negatives is volatility which harms BTC as a currency due to degrading its unit of account.

Great first step. Next step - 
 Everyone needs to make sure they setup and verify an account with an exchange that supports or finds 148 acceptable prior to Aug 1st. You should start this process immediately -
Poloniex and Bitsquare will likely support it followed by bitfinix, kraken and bitstamp
Whether you decide to take the safe approach and sell you Jihancoin, legacy , or jihancoin + legacy coins first and sit on fiat while the dust settles , or take the gamble and also reinvest in acquiring more UASF coins is up to you but you need to be prepared.
Exchanges are backed up on support and therefore you should start this process immediately if you don't already have accounts with exchanges .

Altcoins tend to be far worse as p2p cash than BTC in my opinion because :

type question
The problem you are likely having is you are trying to restore the private keys associated with a legacy address starting with 1 that was created with older version of brd with a newer segwit wallet. 
In either case you need to do an onchain tx to send your BTC from the address that starts with 1 to a P2SH segwit address that starts with 3 or a native segwit address that starts with bc1 anyways to upgrade to better security and lower fees. 
thus restore the 12 words on brd and send to your new wallet with onchain tx , fees are very low now -

Most LN channels never need to be closed.
you can refill Ln channels without any onchain tx
you can amortize the cost of a single onchain tx fee across many buyers that wish to load LN channels

channel factories allow for many channels to be created cheaply

there are plenty of used satellite dishes here in my country , thus it costs a mere 60 usd to get up with a sat feed. Also , don't assume a country with poor internet infrastructure , is "poor" . There are many people living in multi millionaire mansions in paradise(That extranjeros will pay large sums of money to visit) and the only internet they can get regardless of how much money they are willing to spend is 2-4MB down. There are many factors to consider.
FYI -- I have traveled and lived extensively in what some call "third world countries"  and regardless of the income(2 usd an hour salaries) almost everyone has a fancy smartphone and luxuries like satellite cable and other items so your assumption doesn't match with reality either.

Core nodes for users don't activate segwit with a certain method, but are just ready when miners activate segwit. 
Since Core does not support 148 or 149 activation than users need to proactively go out of their way to run those nodes or include a uacomment. If core did merge in 148 I would also suggest those votes are not necessarily in support for 148 , because many users upgrade to the latest version regardless of individual features.

Segwit does have widespread consensus as evidence by 96% + node support
Most businesses in support and ready - 
Even 80% of the hashrate just agreed to immediately activate segwit in the last meeting. 
BIP148 merely activates segwit to fulfill this consensus. 


False. It is up to the miners if they want to split the chain or not as they already agreed to immediately activate segwit. We are simply holding them to their words.

logically it would be safer to invest more in btc now even if there were 2 coins because there is a greater chance that the cumulative price of the 2 bitcoins will be higher even after a split like we say in the ETh split.

Join market is excellent, and I have used it in the past. Wasabi just makes UX much easier which is another important contribution to this space. I suppose I could also give credit to Samourai as well , but that project has a questionable history so left it off. 
For other users  - joinmarket is the only good solution to coinjoin small amounts of BTC as Wasabi requires for only larger amounts of Btc to be mixed. Joinmarket also allows you to profit from providing liquidity unlike wasabi.

No, you need to use and onchain transaction if you want BTC to be moved from a legacy address starting with 1 to a bech32 native segwit address starting with bc1

Sorry for repeating this but its needs a to be said again. Since Binance is covering the theft users are probably even more naive and will likely trust Binance when there is a good chance they are running fractional now and thus even more dangerous exchange to trust. 
Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 
There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties
You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 
You are exposed to exit theft 
You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit

You are thinking about a SF , the 2nd part of segwit2x is a HF which forces every node to upgrade to follow the HF , thus there is no lower average due to slow to upgrade clients. Thus segwit2x after the HF will produce blocks average 4MB and up to 8MB. 
Of course this HF is unlikely to happen and we will likely simply be left with segwit.

Principally -

It is quasi, as most web wallets have full custodial access. It is both good and bad.

No, over 80% of the source code to the protocol has been completely been changed over the years and it is a very well reviewed piece of open source software


Are you suggesting Satoshi is an ASIC manufacturer? Any large asic manufacturer can choose to pull off a 51% attack , what is your point? Are you aware of the game theory and incentives that prevent 51% attacks?


Who cares, the code speaks for itself and is not dependent upon faith or trusting any person. Any new changes are heavily peer reviewed by many different people in the community including myself.


This is demonstrably untrue. Have you heard of BAKKT or any of the ETFs, or the CME and CBOE futures? Are you aware that many banks are forced to buy BTC to pay for ransomeware? 
Even if this trend is reversed and traditional finance stops using BTC heavily as they are now , this would be completely fine because Bitcoins main raison d'etre is regulatory arbitrage so has a bright future in the black and grey market use cases alone.

I am excited for the benefits of taproot and dandelion for Bitcoin privacy on the base layer but would rather not have too strong privacy onchain because - 
personally I would rather have higher degrees of privacy working on other layers like lightning or sidechains(liquid CT) or wallets (Wasabi/samourai) than the base layer because:
1)The auditability of inflation and the 21 million limit is critical. All complex privacy crypto solutions may have undetectable bugs that lead to very difficult to detect inflation. With Bitcoin everyone can easily audit the chain.
2)I want to use a coin where people can choose to be transparent or private
3)In the future privacy coins will be the first to be banned and liquidity is super critical. There are good reasons why most DNM txs are still using BTC
4) privacy  tech like ring signatures, CT, and zk-snarks has huge scalability tradeoffs

Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers.

I am not going to go into a book report of info so I will give you 1 specific example and than let you do the rest of the research on the other altcoins as you don't want to pick a topic. 
Charles Hoskinson (formerly working on the scam ethereum) created cardano as a smart contract platform to compete with Ethereum. He also was involved in the scam bitshares with Dan. Notice how these devs jump from one project to another pumping and dumping their investments and printing more and more money as they go along(Are you aware that Bitshares that Charles co- created also kept having multiple fundraising moments where previous investors where mislead and lied to?) Anyways being a smart contract platform cardano is trying to create a solution to a problem that does not exist and in one of the most insecure manners unlike technologies like simplicity. There is no risk of censorship in code execution thus there is no point or efficiency to be created with using such an insecure platform with such a large attack surface. This is snake oil being sold to the credulous. If you disagree than please explain one example of what efficiency can be provided by cardano.(This is where one needs to be a programmer to evaluate the claims promoted by these scams helps.)

Bitcoin is riskier than Gold , but one should hedge a small % of their portfolio or reserves in it simply because its an uncoorelated asset class. Thus you can reduce your exposure to risk with a smaller allocation so Bulgaria owning 1-5% of their reserves in BTC would be wise. 
Multisig and SSS with auditing can reduce your concerns with theft.

Rootstock is one alternative which will shortly be out, and no need to invest in another token, just buy bitcoin. Keep in mind that "smart contracts" is mainly a buzzword and there is no real life application or efficiency for any of this tech yet , it is far too immature and most of it won't ever pan out.


Bitcoin has no premine, thus isn't an illegal security that the SEc can investigate and courts have already indicated bitcoin cannot be classified as a security 
Bitcoin has a much smaller attack surface and a large qualified group of more competent developers peer reviewing and testing
Bitcoin scales far better than ETh - Also Ethereum blockchain bloat is growing uncontrollably and surpassed bitcoin to a massive 180GB that may reach 1TB this year -
Bitcoin has thus far shown to be immutable , and not centrally controlled. 
Bitcoin is limited with a defined inflation plan unlike ETh which has inflation forever

Block Chains are extremely inefficient databases by design , with or without proof of work. 
They have very narrow use cases , and almost always are scams , especially when no Proof of Work is involved. 
Blockchains have very narrow use cases unlike what most people claim in this thread. The only reason Blocks within a Blockchain exist is specifically because the Poisson process used in proof of work. There is no need to batch together transactions in blocks without this as doing so merely ads latency which is completely unnecessary as one can merely cryptographically link together a chain of transactions if one wanted to . This is also the reason many other projects that do not use proof or work are pivoting away from using the term Blockchain and using the term DLT instead.
Some people promote "Block Chains" as this transformative technology that will magically improve everything in society which is completely misleading. Block chains , with or without proof or work , are extremely inefficient "databases" by design. This inefficiency is a specific tradeoff to pay for censorship resistance. Therefore if something does not need censorship resistance than it most likely has no need for a blockchain.
•	Censorship resistance value transfer or currency is indeed in need of a Blockchain
•	Executing complex code or "smart contracts" does not need censorship resistance. There is no censorship risk in code execution now and in the foreseeable future
•	Cloud storage has no need for blockchains as one simply needs to backup their data a few times and cryptographically secure it for privacy
•	Health data has absolutely no need for a blockchain as this data needs to be used and shared with doctors and allowing clients or doctors to lose the private keys to crucial client data is too dangerous
•	Tokenization is nothing new in the finance industry . These were once called "securities" now they are called ICO's or "utility tokens"
•	Blockchains can not be used to solve problems with voting as those mainly have to do with accurately counting and imputing the information in a private manner
There is usually no point to using a distinct blockchain as well as one can use a secure blockchain like Bitcoin without the need of inefficiently replicating all its work and security and timestamp with  or  or creating assets with  or  or  without the need for any distinct blockchain and the overhead this requires.

ETH is also a premined scam itself. 
1) Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and was previously involved in a quantum mining scam right before starting ethereum.
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.

**Bech32 (Addresses that start with BC1)**
Pros -
1) native SegWit-Bech32 address to save ~36-58% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Better checksum and better error correction and detection - 
3) less blockweight used thus more tx per block
4) All lowercase so easier to read off without making mistakes
1) Not all businesses and wallets support it right now
**SegWit-P2SH (some addresses that start with 3)**
Pros -
1) SegWit-P2SH address starting with 3 to save ~26-44% in fees for same priority vs sending from non segwit address
2) Backwards compatible with all wallets
Cons -
1) Higher fees than native segwit for same priority
2) larger txs than native segwit so more block congestion
3) Less ideal address format compared to advantageous of bech32

Covert Asicboost allows one miner - Bitmain - to have a 15-30% mining advantage over other pools, which causes a misalignment of incentives , centralizing mining(we have seen multiple pools shutdown over the years) and undermining PoW security .

I did answer you , I honestly believe a split wont happen - especially with options like this 
Miners have so many options to avoid a chain split that they would delibretely have to want to split the network if it occurs. 
Perhaps you should rephrase your question to this?


The answer to this is perhaps. If a split happens than the hashrate on the 148 chain would start very small, but than speculation wars would set in as both sides begun to dump their split coins and rebuy the chain of preference. This would mean that the 148 chain could grow from 1% to 25% (all that is needed to be secure from attacks)  or higher on the same day. Once at those numbers miners will be pressured to either join the UASF chain, SF or HF to prevent a reorg wipeout from occurring. It is also possible that these speculation wars could take 1 week or longer to occur as I know I will be trying to fetch top dollar for my legacy coins so I have more fiat to buy the UASF coins. This means that the split coins wont immediately be exhausted on day one for many because we don't want to have someone buy them all off for a very low amount in hopes of preventing their chain from remaining low.

correct , we saw over 99% of hashrate initially with the ETH fork. Which brings up a good point. Hashrate is only an indirect measurement of the community and doesn't necessarily take into account a true representation of the economic majorities interest. 
To be fair , the jury is still out on whether ETC can sustain 10-20% hashrate, but at minimum this didn't go as smoothly as some promised and a good lesson for bitcoin to plan far ahead and be prepared.

To support UASF 148 . Everyone needs to make sure they setup and verify an account with an exchange that supports or finds 148 acceptable prior to Aug 1st. You should start this process immediately - 
Whether you decide to take the safe approach and sell you Jihancoin, legacy , or jihancoin + legacy coins first and sit on fiat while the dust settles , or take the gamble and also reinvest in aquiring more UASF coins is up to you but you need to be prepared. 
Exchanges are backed up on support and therefore you should start this process immediately if you don't already have accounts with exchanges .

No, I have been with bitcoin for many years now and supported it for a long while . Never been into alts , and investing in alts undermines the 21 million limit for me , so rather keep going with bitcoin even if it involves a new PoW algo(very unlikely scenario)


The majority in all categories want segwit. We aren't forcing anything on anyone. If they strongly oppose segwit they should reject us and BIP148 with a SF or HF of their own. 


A permanent split would massively undermine one of bitcoins important properties = store of value. It would still be useful for short term routing though. The alternative to this is waiting a few more months for Jihans and co imposed HF which would also permanently split the community and allow them more time to gather resources and organize in an unfair PoW ecosystem with an unpatched exploit.

This is not a scam but simply a reflection of how ill-liquid Bitcoin is with the fact that a single billionaire can move the market so much unlike with USD, euros, or Gold which have far larger amounts of liquidity. 
 If you day trade BTC , this absolutely means that you are at a greater disadvantage. Don't day trade.

It has an ongoing illegal premine ICO scam for a product that cannot possibly succeed because it offers no efficiency.


He is listed as an advisor on their website 


Consult a securities lawyer or here is a quick summary - 


There is no censorship risk in code execution so this merely increases the inefficiencies and attack surface. Do you understand that satoshi and other bitcoin devs deliberately disabled most of its scripting capability within bitcoin early on and for good reason? (IE...Op_CAT) Those that really understand programming and security understand how absurd the ethereum project is. Thus I believe that Vitalik is an active charlatan. 


That isn't my contention. My contention is that even if you ignore the massive premine and other lies,  Ethereum is fundamentally unsound and cannot securely scale and will not provide any market efficiencies outside the creation of illegal ICO securities , which fundamentally boils down to the smart contract of "multisig"


Huh? There is no defined inflation rate or final algo . Vitalik has gone back and forth over this even to this day and is now thinking about possibly doing a transitional hybrid PoW/TaPoS algo. These are just facts and it is absurd that someone can invest in a project that has still yet to define these fundamental aspects which have far reaching consequences. What is the inflation rate after the algo switch? What is the final algo?

Replay issues are largely overblown and exchanges only need to be more careful sending split coins out not accepting them. Plus there are already several exchanges that support BIP148 and it is absurd that most exchanges wont also jump on board like we saw with ETH split ... too much money to be made in a large speculation war. 


Why would we need to tx on the UASF chain initially? It is trivial to split the coins without any tx occurring on the UASf chain and than send the legacy coins to an exchange to dump , replay risk free . The other side will have the problem selling their split UASF coins though. 


miners follow profits... and I have just shown how it is very possible that the price of the legacy coin can quickly drop.

Also this attempt is timed to undermine any BIP149 effort as the quickest Jorge Timon is looking for that is 6 months . This makes BIP148 (still risky and less than ideal) even more imperative because it is either a guarantee messy split with segwit2x or a possibly split with BIP148

A premine is wrong because it becomes an illegal security and opens up the blockchain for attacks from gvt organizations like the SEC and PBoC. It also means that the coin has an attack point where it has a central body - eth foundation , to go to . It also misaligns incentives , it also is likely that the devs participating in the presale too... there are many problems with premines.

It is simple and has already occured before with ETH so we have a case example. If a split occurs :
IE... You have 10 BTC
Split happens aug 1st (unlikely, but we are discussing hypothetical worse case) 
You will own 10 x Legacy BTC and 10 x 148 Chain BTC.
Both will likely drop a lot in value and both will be highly volatile. 
But since a speculation war is occurring(with new fiat coming in)  both cumulatively will be higher in value. 
The bottom line is store the BTC in your own core node/hardware wallet , or even electrum is fine so you guarantee you have both sides of the split.(exchanges will likely split for you but it isn't guaranteed and they may delay payout)

Transaction fees are dependent upon many variables such as:
1) Transaction fee market (many altcoins have low fees and low security specifically because hardly anyone uses them, also alts are worth far less = see 
2) Fees are priced in the token itself , thus a very valuable coin like Bitcoin will have higher fiat fees naturally onchain and only on other layers can fees be priced lower. **Thus you want to lock in the lower fees now , rather than later because Bitcoin will likely be much more valuable later this year**
3) The type of address you send the Bitcoin from. You might have your BTc in a legacy address that starts with 1 because BTC.com wallet switched to P2SH segwit later, but regardless you definitely do not have your BTC in a native Bech 32 address(starts with bc1) that has even lower fees than P2SH segwit due to smaller tx sizes. **You need to move your BTC to an address which will save you tx fees in the future and its far wiser to pay a few pennies now than more in the future**, the only way to get your BTC into a native segwit address is with an onchain tx , you cannot import the keys.
4) The size of the tx in weight thus if you have a ton of dust or small inputs you will want to consolidate. In the future batch txs can save you money as well. 
**Thus now is the time to move your BTC into native segwit addresses and spending cash into LN channels**
Install eclair (android) or bluewallet (ios) and send some spending btc to that and open a lightning channel :

Of course I would split them first like I already stated. 


You aren't paying attention . You absolutely don't need to make any UASF chain tx to split the coins. None.
Exchanges will get on board when there is money to be made, it is foolish to believe otherwise. 


It is preferable to use post legacy split coins to taint using the legacy chain and avoid any tx on the UASF chain as that would have minimal hashrate and thus be unsafe. 


All it takes is one exchange , than most the rest jump on board . Weren't you paying attention during the ETH split ?
Replay is a non issue because miners will Either SF or HF their chain quickly to protect against wipeout reorg and before they do that it isn't hard to split the coins and exchanges aren't at risk from deposits. 
The interesting aspect is the Legacy side will be delayed in getting their split coins to an exchange because the poor hashrate on the minority chain so this may be over very quickly when the legacy chain price instantly crashes.

There won't be a losing side. Either miners activate segit before or on Aug 1st (and claim they are simply fulfilling the NY agreement to save face), cause a temporary split than join the 148 chain claiming that they support the economic users and allowed the market to determine the will of the people, or 2 coins persist indefinitely. 


There only needs to be a HF on the UASF chain if the UASF supporters run out fiat and split coins to drive the legacy chains price down and support the UASf chain and if they don't have at least 25% total hashrate. In this case we would likely HF to a new PoW algo thus creating an alt. It likely wont need to come to this but something we are prepared for.

 &gt; or sharing some sources that back up your claim. 
I have been very clear as to why Ethereum is a scam but you keep ignoring my very clear evidence and glossing over it. 
1) Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not and idiot and was previously involved in a quantum mining scam right before starting ethereum and is active at promoting scams even to this date like primalbase
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths 
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness" 
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because their is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future their will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? 
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even  defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalic and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.

Review the data. 96% + of all nodes run recent versions of core that signal and are ready for segwit. 


148 is merely an activation method as opposed to BIP9. With a SF , unlike a HF, you don't need high consensus among nodes for activation method, miners just need to support it and 80% of miners promised immediate activation of segwit. If they are lying and their agreement was a stalling tactic I welcome a split on Aug 1st

This is a false dichotomy. Its isn't SPV or Full node , people should use both as they both have advantages and disadvantages.

Unlike with Proof of Stake where stakers have opportunity cost losses for staking less profitably and thus incentived to sell their coin with proof of work miners has fixed investments such as infrastructure and ASICs that they will continue to mine on less profitably to make a ROI off their initial investment. 
With Proof of work miners often have fixed electrical contracts thus will continue mining because they have already paid for such electricity or or legally obligated to pay for such electricity. 
Most of proof of work mining with BTC is down with renewable energy that has fixed upfront costs and "free" thereafter so they will continue mining 
ASICs are continually being made more efficient thus hashrate per KWh is always improving
Even if the price of bitcoin drops by 75% instantly and 75% of hashrate is turned off (won't happen for reasons above) than **inflation dramatically slows** and the mempool builds growing the transaction fees which in turn incentivizes both price of Bitcoin to recover and miners to turn their ASICs back on 
Miners have a strong incentive to insure that Bitcoin continues to succeed longterm and thus will choose to mine at a loss short term or simply stop selling their mined BTC for some period of time till BTC price recovers

The same way the results are published today where full nodes peer the "results" to each other in real time.
If full nodes "publish"(peer) with another node relaying an invalid tx(published new rules) than those nodes are automatically banned and a fork is created. 
If 99% hash power support new rules that any subset of full nodes deem invalid than those blocks are invalid(to that subset of full nodes) and nodes relaying them are automatically banned
Are you simply confused to how nodes find consensus automatically and "publish" this consensus or are you asking another question?

There are many aspects to security , and one of the largest and most common ways people lose their Bitcoin is by making mistakes and forgetting passwords. 
This is one reason why it is critical for the BIP39 backup to be written down for recovery, as any password with sufficient entropy to avoid being bruteforced or dictionary attacked can easily be forgotten. 
If you are concerned about your physical backup being compromised the solution is to do a 2 of 3 or 3 of 5 multisig or SSS, or at minimum use a passphrase where the BIP39  12/18/24 words is kept separately  than the passphrase

Why would we need to make txs on the minority chain while we win the miners back? We want to save UASF chains not spend them during this time. Thus it will be easy to spend(BTC to Fiat) and sell (on exchanges) on the legacy chain and hard to do the same on the UASf chain therefore there will be greater negative price pressure on the legacy. 


They already are preparing somewhat ... but they didn't take long with the ETh split. I remember that within 1 day polo was jealous of bitsquare and integrated everything including splitting and replay protection.




I would expect bitfinix, bitsquare, and polo to list the UASf on the 8 or 9th if a split occurred... but this discussion is rather silly , even if one of the 3 small exchanges was used that currently support BIP148 that is fine as arbitrage occurs.

UASF doesn't have widespread consensus but we have 2 months to build and and SFs don't need the same levels of consensus as HFs.


This is far from known. We have 2 test cases where the same miner bulked from UASF pressure for segwit:vertcoin and litecoin. Bitcoin may be different so we must prepare for a split but we have no intentions to force a split either. If the miners don't support their users who demand segwit, and we cannot trust their recent promise to immediately activate segwit than we should split as they aren't securing the chain as they should.

Lets take UASF 148 as an example. SF add additional rules by definition. If miners decide to support those additional rules that a subset of the community desires , than the result is no chain split. If some % of the miners do not enforce these new rules than there will be a chain split.

The devs likely participated in the presale as well so there is no way of knowing how many coins they hold. Many have been involved in these ICO scams too so could have massive amounts of ETH from their involvement. 


They fit all the definitions under the Howey test thus are viewed as securities. If they were merely commodity tokens for a service than they could simply sell their service with a SaaS model. This is fundraising without going through VC capital and bypassing securities law and isn't foolong anyone. 
That isn't how lawyers look at it and bitcoin barely escaped being a security because there was no sale of premine and there was no controlling organization in charge or a premine sale like we see in ETh and all these ICOs

Whatever the opinion(or lack thereof) is of these uninformed users that merely trust core and prefer stability... the end results are the same. In over 1 year BU cannot get over 3 % community node support, and segwit2x supporters are unlikely to turn any of those 80k+ full nodes over to run segwit2x instead of core in a mere 3 months . 
If miners and segwit2x supporters go ahead with the Hf than almost the complete network will instantly ban them and consider their blocks invalid.
So why did 20% of these companies support such a ridiculous HF proposal? Is it merely a ploy to activate segwit or are they really so ignorant or arrogant as to believe they can instantly get all those nodes to switch against most oracles advice in such a narrow time frame?

They need to create a budget, pay off all their credit cards, start savings up 1 month expenses minimum in fiat for emergencies...
than start buying some BTC, investing in their company matched 401k or invest in an index fund directly , and continue putting away fiat savings till till they have at least 6 months worth. Thereafter invest in stocks and BTC. 
Most people can do this with a proper budget and good priorities. 


These people should be very careful and make an investment plan and stick to it and avoid daytrading. 


Having 3-6 months of fiat savings makes you a wiser and more rational investor in Bitcoin and stocks. If you have this nest egg you never need to sell for a loss if an unexpected emergency comes up. It also reduces your stress and makes you worry less and you don't waste time checking the price every 10 minutes.


If you absolutely need to have a thrill of possible quick appreciation (gamblers mindset) , than take that 150 and place 75USD of it in fiat savings and the other 75% in BTC.


Gambling on lottery is a probabilistically certain worse choice. Almost anything you do with that fiat spent on scratchoffs would be a better choice.(besides hard drugs) So yes , investing in BTC is better , much better . 


I would say BTC is less dangerous than penny stocks at this stage. Stick to index funds that track the SP500, DOW, or your company 401k because they likely match, and Bitcoin

Many promoting segwit2x are delibretely attempting to confuse users and suggesting the lie that segwit isn't a blocksize increase.

But a lot of those categories do involve stupid gimmick products that are guaranteed to become failures and many scams as well. 
Cloud mining is principally a joke to CTO's and Network admins and merely a way to con managers with the latest buzzword. IOT is also a buzzword filled with insecure and stupid products as well... many call it the internet of shit -  


It is indeed true, 60 million token sale and 12 million given to devs . 
Premines make the coin a security , not getting approval of this security adds legal scrutiny and introduces a security attack from regulators like the SEC or PBoC. 


There are some things that are illegal but ethical and offer an efficiency like Uber, lyft and airbnb. There are other things which offer no purpose or efficiency and thus amount to pointless ponzis and a net inefficiency. ICO's represent unethical illegal securities which misalign incentives and will almost guarantee these companies become failures.


The only "smart contracts" that have proven to have any value , even in ETh are examples like multisig, CLTV and CSV. Everything else increases the attack surface and merely adds technical debt. 
What censorship risk exists in code execution justifies this added inefficiency? Why don't I simply run the "smart contract" code on my own secure, backed up server instead of paying the gas tax on a very slow , bloated and as we just seen unreliable world VM?

It is hard to access who the economic majority is with a pseudonymous ledger.

This is why I tell people to not buy Bitcoin until they have at least 3-6 months of fiat for expenses as an emergency fund and payed off all high interest debt before investing in BTC. If they don't do this they can still use BTC to save 20% off amazon and other discounts but should not speculate on it. I also set their expectations where they should at least wait 2-4 years before even considering taking profits. 
If they still choose to not follow this advice than they are simply reckless and deserve to get whats coming to them just like the many other foolish decisions they make in life. 


Bitcoin was only 1k at the start of 2017 ... this is not way early. These people are up almost 6x in a very short amount of time. 


Sounds to me you feel guilty based upon either other people misleading new bitcoin investors or the fact that you misled them. Just be honest with people about Bitcoin and tell they realistic expectations and you won't feel guilty. You have no control over people lying to others except  by correcting these lies and trying to educate others. You are not educating others by lying as you just did. Simply saying Bitcoin lost almost half its value in 1 month is fine and something we should tell others. 19k to 2k in 1 month never happened.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:04:40
You should buy as much now before Aug 1st because uasf148 should encourage people to buy BTC if anything as it brings to close stagnation. Even in the worst scenarios where BTC splits it would be wise to buy BTC now, because a speculation war between both factions will bring more fiat in to each side, and the total price of both coins combined will likely be higher. 
Either miners decide to activate segwit on or before and bitcoin rallies or we have a split and you have an opportunity to greatly profit by doing something like this - 
1) Splitting the coins safely
2) Selling off 100% of Legacy coin for fiat and waiting for dust to settle before taking action with that fiat
3) Holding UASF coins themselves and waiting for dust to settle before tx on UASF chain.
This eliminates most concerns and would potentially reward many users. If BIP148 fails users can eventually sell UASFcoins and rebuy back legacy coins with this and fiat sitting by for likely no loss in BTC and likely a gain in BTC. If BIP148 is a success user will make a large profit from those betting against UASF.

148 mining is something else entirely. We will get segwit regardless , and likely because BIP 91 with the NY agreement. Since segwit is a SF , 148 miners can continue to mine with 148 nodes even after segwit is activated by BIP9 or BIP91.
We should encourage UASF users to continue to buy ASICs though as we will have another standoff HF in 3 months, and if we can show a serious trend in node count and mining support for UASF it will make the HF even less credible.

Why not ? It is during adversarial times that nodes need to perform the best.  Additionally , it isn't merely worst case, with segwit2x , the blocks will average ~4MB and often go above that. 


Why not wait to see if we can first saturate the millions network(TPS) transactions per second first with payment channels rather than do something so dangerous for a measly 14  tps bump?


No , segwit blocksize alone will cause node and mining centralization. I will have problems keeping my home node up with segwit. 


Why not do more research first with doubling the blocksize before charging ahead and quadrupling it within a rushed 2 months? This is exactly my point , we need to slow down and gather more data before we HF.


And 1MB was too large for most of that time. It was only due to the great efficiency improvements within the protocol and relay networks that 1MB is barely acceptable today. Those wanting to keep the blocksize at 1MB and reject segwit blocksize increase have valid concerns.


He didn't , miners have softlimited the blocksize multiple times at based upon consulting the data with developers through bitcoins history

Pruning has been available for some time now, and while you can and should prune off the witnesses , the least concern I have is with the storage costs. One still has to download, validate, and relay the witnesses before one prunes them.

3) Bandwidth costs 
4) CPU and RAM for validating txs quickly

1) Follow the profits as we re-invest in the 148 chain that will eventually disable covert asic boost given to their competitor Bitmain 
or 
2) Give 100% of 3 days worth of blocks to Bitmain , and follow them with their altcoin that 96% of node will instaban and almost none of the dev community will follow for a chain that gives unfair advantage of covert asic boost to 1 pool

You can weight the results which uses traffic. But miners should likely evaluate exchanges , devs , users, businesses separately as they have a different impact.  They should also likely weight the importance of each vote when deciding. 
This being said , miners don't need to listen to any of their users, and can mine any product they want, and I can ignore this new product if I want as well. The question they have to ask themselves is .... does most of the community want segwit?  if yes , than they should support it.

Ethereum and all the ICOs are a Securities in the US as defined by the Howey test. You don't need to trust my word , research it yourself or ask a securities lawyer. In the US it becomes an illegal security without the proper paperwork and approval = the case for all these tokens. If Ethereum Didn't have a massive premine ICO sale and it was 100% PoW than it wouldn't be classified as a security as defined under the Howey test.
It doesn't matter that Ethereum tried to avoid securities laws by setting up the foundation in Switzerland. US law applies to them as long as one US citizen participates in the ICO.  
The SEC is currently actively litigating against garza of the paycoin scam where he sold illegal securities, and has fined Ripple and Voorhees in the past as well. They tend to take their time , slowly gather evidence , and wait for the complaints to roll in before taking action because they prefer an airtight case and thus win close to 100% of cases they litigate against. Therefore as these ICOs begin to pop and Eth bubble pops expect action from the SEC as they clean up and collect easy money and make more arrests.

Those of us promoting BIP148 and activating segwit on aug 1 see a larger threat from not taking decisive action now vs waiting 1 year and allowing Bitmain to continue exploiting a flaw in PoW and build up their warchest further. Those hoping for status quo aren't being realistic with what dangers we face. A split will either come on our terms or Jihans terms and we choose to act now before he can further prepare.

You haven't been paying attention because right now txs on the ethereum network are slower than btc because of 1 single ICO. 
Also Ethereum blockchain bloat is growing uncontrollably and surpassed bitcoin to a massive 180GB that may reach 1TB this year -
The bottom line is that EThereum as a platform will scale far worse than bitcoin as designed

Investing 100% in one split chain is indeed high risk / High reward, but users can indeed have extremely low risk and profit by-
1) Splitting the coins safely
2) Selling off 100% of Legacy coin for fiat and waiting for dust to settle before taking action with that fiat
3) Holding UASF coins themselves and waiting for dust to settle before tx on UASF chain.
This eliminates most concerns and would potentially reward many users. If BIP148 fails users can eventually sell UASFcoins and rebuy back legacy coins with this and fiat sitting by for likely no loss in BTC and likely a gain in BTC. If BIP148 is a success user will make a large profit from those betting against UASF.

Mining is very competitive and covert asicboost misaligned incentives and has been very damaging to decentralized mining profitability. After segwit activates this should make the market a bit more fair , but we still likely need other ways to motivate home mining

The risk of a split is coming regardless. Status quo is not possible. I am fighting for the best way forward that minimizes a split and that is UASF 148. I would prefer UASF149 but the delays will allow Bitmain to further build up their war chest and finish deploying their HF.

The image represents a decline in purchasing power of USD, and the fact that people are paid less back than is related to USD losing in value due to inflation every year. 
The argument being made is that the USD should not be saved , but immediately spent because it is not a great long term store of value which is correct.
What is silly is any suggestion for us to go back to the gold standard however. Another thing that is silly is any notion that it is a great idea to use gold as a long term investment and presenting a false dichotomy that one should simply compare gold vs USD when one should consider that investing in an index fund would have averaged a 9.8% return per year over that time period (doubling your money every 7 years or if you account for taxes than ~10 years) thus making gold a good store of value but a horrible investment .

Almost all users prefer BIP9 activation, but only if miners immediately activate , but based upon miner stonewalling core users fall into either BIP148UASF camp or BIP149UASF camp , or status quo. Most users fall into 148 of the 3. 


That isn't how users upgrade. It is a slow process typically and took 7 months to get 84% segwit node support - 


Segwit has enough support for miners to activate based upon the numbers. No HF proposals have enough support. 
Hopefully one day a Hf proposal will get 99% + support.

Bitcoin was worth nothing when released as well, you cannot compare the two.

As it stands right now there is no final spec , code , and they plan on Hf in 2-3 months. This is outrageously irresponsible. HF need 12-18 months after specs, well reviewed, and well tested minimum. 


Yes, so why not saturate the millions of network TPS in payment channels first , gather more data , than consider a HF?


I agree, perhaps a combination of rootstock and LN and other solutions. Lets try these, gather more data , than move on.

Block weight instead of blocksize is what occurs with segwit. Thus the limits are set to account for an accurate network and resource cost. 
Keeping the variable limit "MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE" is done for legacy support as segwit is a SF . With A HF any change can be done and the variables might look like this -  
MAX_POSSIBLE_BLOCK_SIZE   in this example because we are dealing with a variable weight

The biggest limitation was lack of water . a couple years ago we confirmed the moon has a ton of frozen water to provide oxygen , fuel , and water. This will make asteroid mining much cheaper. 
Keep in mind that colonizing space and leaving earth is heavily subsidized by governments and the private sector for communications and research . Also space tourism will become popular. Thus the costs of mining will be much lower as shuttles leaving earth will always be multi-purposed. 


Moving things in space quickly is extremely inexpensive as there is no air 


NASA has no problem sending probes through asteroid belts so I don't know what the fear is here. 


My initial projections were 20+ years but it might occur sooner with this announcement . Keep in mind that as soon as this probe changes NASA's estimates to real numbers in 2026 the market will start to price in this expected flood even before delivery. Most of golds value is speculative and based upon the assumption of scarcity with asteroid mining not priced in for the most part

300KB limit will not happen as there is no consensus on reducing the limit thus the limit will stay at 4 MB of weight or ~2MB avg size with mostly segwit txs

I make no such assumption. Some delibretely troll and attack Bitcoin to drive users to their alts but many people legitimately like to gamble with daytrading and speculating on alts or find something they like about alts. 


No one is forcing anyone. We are giving everyone a good advanced warning (148 was proposed in march BTW) that we will be buying and using only a product that contains segwit on Aug 1st. Miners have no obligation to mine it. Users have no obligation to follow our fork. Anyone can SF or HF at anytime as we are all free to run any software we wish free of coercion. We have no obligation to continue using and buying stale blocks.

I don't agree with Tim here. Volatility can be measured against a basket of goods like the CPI and Bitcoin is very volatile in this respect. 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin  sounds good but volatility is a negative aspect to bitcoin as a currency and exists because the lack of liquidity. This is why most stores that accept Bitcoin still price things in stable forms of fiat instead of Bitcoin. In due time bitcoin will become less volatile as its liquidity increases but we need to be honest with each other of Bitcoin's weaknesses.

I have posted detailed price analysis in the past and you typically save 1 usd by using a buy limit order  a few pennies below spot on coinbase pro for every 100 usd bought... but at the cost of waiting a week for your fiat to post unlike cash app ... thus cash app can be better compared to the 1.49% fees on coinbase and thus is cheaper if you need to lock in the price during a bull market.

The great thing about the way bitcoin is designed is it involves voluntary association where anyone can enforce the rules they prefer and walk away at any moment ... thus the only thing that matters to us is our "own little world" and we are perfectly unaffected by malicious actors who want to impose changes we do not agree to because it doesn't ultimately effect us.

This isn't true. There is a very high chance that miners activate segwit on or before Aug 1st to avoid a chainsplit. Those warnings apply only if a chainsplit occurs and have happened in the past multiple times with bitcoin. Remember SPV mining split? Remember 3-11-13 split?

Segwit directly increases the blocksize by a large amount as it practically doubles it, 1.9-2.1MB blocks will become the average with some blocks being as large as 3.6MB. That is direct.

Ethereum is an outright scam. 
1) Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and was previously involved in a quantum mining scam right before starting ethereum and is active at promoting scams even to this date like primalbase
2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths
3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"
4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?
5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalic and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.
