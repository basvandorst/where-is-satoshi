Are you using a plug in? Let us know how you’re setup and accepting it. Thanks!

Checkout SALT. Salt lending. You deposit crypto and get a loan

Yes. On bittrex click the "plus" icon in your wallet next to btc or ETH, this gives you your bittrex deposit address. On Gemini go to withdrawal ETH or btc, paste in the bittrex address.

Ok you’re in charge of this from now on, looking forward to them!

Not everyone is a programmer that can link their shopping cart API to a bitcoin process. People rely on plug ins that are easy to setup. This should show you that there is a need for competition here.

It's all good. If anyone breaks into your account on Gemini then they can transfer $500 of your bank accounts money into Gemini, buy bitcoin or ETH, but they would not be able to cash it out because there's a $500 hold on your account for about 4 days until your deposit clears, holding crypto withdrawals for $500 worth as well. Hopefully you can catch it by then and fix things up by contacting Gemini. 
I haven't heard any stories of Gemini messing with your bank account, if that's what you're concerned about. 
If anything, your existing crypto on Gemini would be at risk.

Take the amount of bitcoins you have, and multiply by the market price on the exchange you use to buy and sell.  This will tell you the current value of your holdings. Compare that to you buy in price.

Why $1,850? Bitcoin Cash gaining popularity? technical analysis? A hunch?

You probably have a virus on your computer that waited for you to login and then steal your coins. You should burn your computer and get a new one.

Hopefully most of the action has taken place already and is priced in for the most part. There could be some fluctuations around  that time.

Leaders and centralization = bad.
No leader and decentralization = good. 
The sooner you learn why this is, the better you and bitcoin will be.

How did the presentation go? Any lessons you learned from teaching newbies about the technology? Any interesting questions?

It is currently unstable because there is only a few billion in BTC. Using a popular analogy, USD is a cargo ship in the ocean, the waves don't bother it much. BTC is a small sail boat in the ocean in comparison, every little wave still has an effect. Once the BTC market cap is a few trillion, small waves will not cause as strong volatility .

[Morpheus voice] What if I told you, learning about bitcoin informs you of when to buy and sell. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:43:14
Don't worry about the price per coin, think about percentage gains on however much you put in. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:41:46
There is something called a ‘spread’ in the order book. It is a gap in the prices between buy and sell price. So sometimes the spread gap can close or open wider. If this happens then the price changes without any buying or selling. People can put on or take off orders from the order book and the price will change. So although price can change from people buying and selling, it also changes from spreads in the order book.

Yeah loser gtfo and go back to the Donald

Gemini.com is my favorite exchange. Slightly faster verification time compared to other exchanges. Kraken is also popular. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:05:30
I'd stay with Gemini over Kraken.

Not exactly sure, but maybe you can have two wallets, one on each cloud service, and just transfer your coins to the new wallet.

You're probably confusing buying and selling. Your description is treating them as the same. When you limit BUY at a price lower than the current price, you are waiting for the market to drop to that price to buy automatically. When you limit SELL at a price lower than the current price, it will sell your coins immediately all the way down to the price you set. If you have hundreds of coins to sell, it will sell through the higher prices down to the lower price you set until you have no more coins to sell.

Try Gemini
