I listen to it again. It seems to say " Get Bitcoins! "
You rule man.

Oh and you're upset because I said you probably have bad credit? I'm laughing my ass off over here! Seriously! Get this, a guy with Excellent! credit wanting the destabilization of the economy. Oh man you're so funny!

This is why I would not invest in bitcoins. People like you are investing in it. Printing money isn't exactly printing more dollars; in the sense it has more to do with how much the banks are able to lend and confident they believe believe would be able to pay them back. The government isn't just printing out hundred dollars bills and boom, free money for them! Like the guy up there said before, it's all about who you trust.
And I would not trust these people involved in bitcoins. You act like you know how bitcoins work, there is no middle man, unregulation is a good thing, bring down the world bitcoins will save us why the world burns! Um ok. Take your 400 credit score and half your net worth and buy a bitcoin. You'll be rich!
You know what they say, when everyone is saying BUY, the big boys quietly sell.

Good for her!

I sold over 18. I was going to hold but fuck, I made over $6k in a couple of days. That works for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:17:36
Thanks man. As far as holding goes, I have no issues with that. Go down, so I can buy another. There is too much interest in this. Will probably sell once it hits 6 figures tho.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:53:17
Can you tell me more?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:21:31
What's a good reason? What the fuck man, I am on board. Don't hate.

Let's do this bro.

I say commodities and the first thing that springs to your head is gold huh? I'm talking apples, peaches. If I go up to someone and offer them my apple for their peach, and they agree. We have just made a financial transaction and it was done with the legal tender of fruit.
So I see now you are admiting this no middle man crap is nonesense. For bitcions to actually have any value there needs to be a middle man. You can't just go around trading bitcoins for bitcoins and that's what so many people fail to understand. The middle man is the dollar or whatever like you said.
Personally, if bitcoins went up to $450,000 in two years I wouldn't be jealous or anything. I mean I know people that own it and I told them to sell when it got over $10,000 and some listened some didn't. So if it goes up to a billion dollars more power to them and to you. But I'm looking at this with rationality. The big boys are getting ready to screw the small frys all over again. I would give you examples but there are so many times things like this has happened I'm sure you can think of you few without even having to do a search.

This is exactly the mentality of the average Bitcoin investor. Freaking out that the real people who who get bitcoins, the Cubans, the Mcabees, even the miners themselves don't hold onto them. They sell. People with no clue are now the buyers.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:02:03
And it keeps going up. Fuck it. I blow a bitcoin every time I go to Vegas.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:36:25
So bitcoins aren't legal tender? What? Even commodities are considered currency. What do you mean they're not currency? So you admit it's just some nonsense someone made up right? There's no middle man right? Have you ever heard of anyone going up to someone and saying here is a bunch of numbers and letter. Shhh, let me trade it for yours ok? 
You are the majority of bitcoin investors. You'll say anything and believe anything to prove you don't understand anything. Have a good one and stay salty my friend. Stay salty
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:42:23
Umm.. I just deal with bitcoins. I know BTC has a lot of meanings. 
Which is why I decided to get in while it's still like this. Peaople are not in the know still. I think $450,000 is the time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:02:27
Why is everyone against me?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:11:15
That's a very good point. But the major difference between software and bitcoins is that software creates a viable object with many applications and purposes. Some software is incredibly valuable, some are not. With bitcoins, those letters and numbers do not spit out anything. It is solely for the identification of shady money. The only thing you can create out of it is greed, panic and enough of it in the right hands pure chaos. Like you're seeing now. 
Seriously, one of the more prominant leaders of bitcoins is a lunatic. And not in a OCD savant kind of way. If the general manager or whatever of where you work told you he would dance in front of the entire staff naked and allow you pluck pieces of hair out of his head if production went up 500% in the next year would you take a company like that seriously?
Exactly. Regular money is just that, paper and metal. Venezuela money isn't worth shit because their government is shit and currupt as hell. You need to find the right type of regular money just like with any form of legal tender. Now I understand that people in poor countries are buying bitcoins as a means to hedge against whatever money their country runs on but why bitcoins? Because having physical American money around could be a death sentence. Because they don't trust the internet and won't set up an account with a US based bank because of all the stories they have heard about hacking and so forth. What these people fail to see is buy buying bitcoins, they're actually doing what they fear. Except bitcoins comes with a clause. Just trust us scumbags running things okie? Bitcoins are a setup. Many will probably be hurt in the next couple of years. A select few, the ones selling and selling, yeah they'll be fine. But people don't want to hear this. Why do you think only like 12 people or something own 50% of everything? They didn't get that way by being ethical and looking out for the masses. They did it the bitcoin way. Get in low, then sound the horns! Let's take from the little chumps. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:15:59
You know what I wrote. I just write casually. Who are you to me? 
Okay wiseguy. Explain what bitcoins are and why they're not a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:34:16
Yeah, Enron was just a small energy company that figured out a way to make others believe they were experts in everything from toilet paper to fiber optics. As far as it never being a stock, sadly enough the people who got in early are now trying to make it one. Giving small timers a sense that it's legit and regulated in some way. When in reality they aren't creating these funds for any reason but to get rid of their bitcoins in a hurry while this fad is still hot. There aren't many people buying bitcoins in large sums. A $150 here, a $500 there isn't allowing them to dump them fast enough for people owning thousands upon thousand of them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:27:21
It's up like 10% since I bought. If this shit is going to $450,000 I want in fuck it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:19:21
I heard make some noise. But just for leaving an answer I would have given you gold in the past but now the interent kind of freaks me out.
There is one I swear.

I'm in damnit.

Let's see the correction! Everybody rich!
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:58:19
It's not really a big deal to me. I upside is too high for me to not be in this.
I tried my best to lower the buy-in. Shit kept going up. fuck it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:44:53
I like this one. Um. I'm going to leave out the murder part tho.

This must be what Conor McGregor felt like when Nate Diaz accused him of being born with a silver spoon in his mouth. What!? You're the one who just said the government prints out more dollar bills to pay off their debts and you're saying I'm the one that's clueless? I voted for Trump? I'm white? I'm the one who can't see things for what they are? Okay answer this for me. Most of you are not buying millions of dollars of bitcoins. I would put the average at $500 if that. So it moved up 10% that day. What do you do? Do you sell and cash out your $50 profit or do you hold onto it, not because you wouldn't mind a quick $50. God knows if you could just give someone $500 and the end of the day he says, here I'll give you $50 plus your $500 back. You'd go bragging to your friends how fucking smart you are. 
You don't sell because the fees would eat up too much of the gains. You don't sell because it's only $550. It could make you a millionaire in a couple of years! Some guy who sells almost every bit he can get his digusting hands told you he would eat his dick in a couple of years if it isn't worth a billion dollars! You don't sell. You'll hold onto it forever. Maybe when it goes down to 50 dollars you'll sell and say to yourself, oh well it was only $500. 
This is exactly the people who run this "unregulated" are hoping for. You say i'm not smart and you're probably right bbut that is an assumption that you think you're smarter than me right? You spew things you've read. Everything you've wrote besides calling me names is something someone told you. Have you ever really sat there and thought what bitcoins really are? They are not any form of currency. They're not even an IOU. It's just something some guy with a "Japanese" name made up for drug dealers to use basically. But going by your name, I can see why that would appeal to you.

Honestly I hope the bubble bursts. I want a few more coins for cheap. But I get it now. This is fucking Avatar type shit.
