Voting is a waste of time; it's extremely inefficient and costly to deal with all this indirectly like this. It's like dealing with 10000 lawyers all trying to stall a million small details each for a decade at an hourly insane rate. 
The system is designed to wear everyone out mentally and economically – which is why things like plausible deniability and working around it is the only way.

As long as you pay taxes this will go on and on and on and she'll be replaced with someone just as bad or even worse. As long as there are taxes, there is money to be made in corruption and corrupt ideas. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 12:50:32
Yep, this is also true.
@_date: 2016-04-14 19:55:04


Well, every country is corrupt. Do you not know this by now?

Get a VPN. Mullvad ( ) takes Bitcoin. Make sure any cookie Bodog might have set to track you (on behalf of friendly local Govt) is gone before you try to connect again. 
edit: btw. i hope you guys are happy getting the "regulation" a lot of you called for     .. land of the free, huh?  /s

Classic and other implementations adopt good features from Core just fine. It'd be great if Core could do the same; take good ideas from others also.

Erm, nope. This guy is not a "top technical expert". He still has had a few interesting things to say tho.
edit: ..and this notion that "top experts" know what they are doing is such a terrible assumption or generalization. Where you been last two decades or whatever while almost *all* "top experts" failed to: 1. prevent financial crisis, 2. see it coming, 3. realize where already in it    ...several times? Please don't answer this; it's a rhetorical question and I really don't care anyway.

Well, then clearly Bitcoin won't stick around for much longer; China or anyone with significant hash power can even pretend to have shitty net only to accumulate control. Time to invest in other tech.
@_date: 2016-03-08 16:13:11
He had some interesting things to say back in 2011 or 2012 or so, but this guy stopped making sense a while ago.

Yes, people will flock to something that will work as BOTH digital gold AND payment network. No one wants to deal with two global digital currencies if they can avoid this; and they can and will.
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:00:41
OK, so you are also worried about centralization of miners in China then, right?
If we increase blocksize less mining will be done in China (they have shitty Internet). How's that?

This is complete nonsense to the point I wonder why anyone would make this up.

Why not 0.1 MB? Or 0.01 MB? This way I can have a full node at the south pole with satellite uplink!       If we get close to 0 MB we will finally have achieved 100% decentralization of &lt;nothing&gt; (because the closer we get to 0 the faster everyone will fucking insta dump all their coin at exchanges after waiting 12 hours for their last ever btc tx to go through) ...it'll be glorious and *just* perfect guys :D :D
(..honestly I don't even *care*; my bot has been hedging this stupid market perfectly for months and will do fine even if we dump back to 20 USD BTC so keep stalling it up guys!)
@_date: 2016-03-20 16:54:40
Maybe, but only big ones.
@_date: 2016-03-20 03:40:56
No point doing this; priesthood of has told us Bitcoin isn't a payment network anymore; only settlements here.
@_date: 2016-03-08 14:29:49
Ripple depends on quite centralized nodes ..  kind of what Core is proposing with their Lightning stuff; let's see how *that* works out..
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:09:27
Not much.
@_date: 2016-03-08 15:54:53


Oh, I don't do much alt trading. I (or my bots) will short BTC no problem tho which is to say I'm covered where I am regardless of what happens. The crypto-currency priesthood can do whatever they like; it won't concern me unless BTC goes to zero.
edit: Here's my 1h bot back when it was written in pinescript:  ..   you're welcome; downvoting plebs go fuck yourselves.

A free market will not accept paying fees for something that's being held down artificially. Economics will rightfully win over this political bickering.

Yeah, flibbr killed my cat. He's terrible. I can't deal with it.
...oh, wait. He didn't. He talks about 12h willy indicator few times per week in the price call room while posting charts. Pretty cool and interesting actually, and he doesn't mind people quite different to himself; even people who like to talk about other things than Bitcoin are welcome; they just hang out in a different voice chat room from the price call room. No need to "manage" anything. SUCH ANARCHY :: SUCH CHAOS :: SUCH TERRIBLE :: SUCH VIOLENCE :: SUCH OPPRESSION :: ...really can't deal with it; too much freedom; my soul cries out in pain and agony just thinking about it.
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:42:10


He's not missing security and trustlessness because of this. E.g. most phone wallets connect to several nodes.
@_date: 2016-02-22 05:09:15
Yeah, good luck with that and the rise in fees that will follow. I'll move to off-shore exchanges, thanks.
