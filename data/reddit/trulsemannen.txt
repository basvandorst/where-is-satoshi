What if you have bitcoin, but you want to buy more. Do the price go up or down then?
Pls tell me, so I know what not to do.

I'm completely new to the whole fork thing. If a split happens, do you get half the value in each of them (so added up you have what you used to)?
Also, how will bitcoin ever become a widely used as a storage of value if you can get fucked by some (to the average person) weird or confusing event?
Am I missing something? I knew bitcoin was volatile and risky, but could I lose half my worth of bitcoin for some reason average Joe's like me have a hard time understanding? Am I completely misintepreting what this whole thing is?

Bitcoin will probably never get even close to 100k if that is so. Also, who gets the fee?

How do more users = Bitcoin doing something better than other coins can? That makes no sense. 
How do more developers = Bitcoin doing something better than other coins can? And lets not forget that Bitcoin has been stale for ages.
How is Bitcoin more secure than say Litecoin?
How do a decentralized network = Bitcoin doing something better than other coins? And lets not forget the enormous control miners have on Bitcoin and its development. 
None of these points point to Bitcoin doing something better than other coins.

What does Bitcoin do that no other coin can do better?


You can trade other coins for fiat as well, if that's what you're talking about?

You have yet to provide any argument yourself other than calling me a troll.
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:44:57
I'm sorry, but you should really educate yourself more about this. That is just one of the most ignorant comments I've seen here in a while. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:46:16
The fact that you think every other coin is a scamcoin is such a great example of your ignorance.
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:31:36
You can think that if you want, but I'm afraid that same ignorance is what's eventually going to bite you in the ass in the crypto world.

You don't hear about money/dollars because people talked about it to their friends back in the day. You hear about it because, for its time, it was a great fucking system. Same goes for Bitcoin. Telling your friends about it is not what's going to decide if it's successful or not. It being a great system is. If Bitcoin is as great as we hope it to be, then people will eventually hear about it, and actually use it. *Then* you can have as many Bitcoin signs as you wish.

Oh yeah, I forgot about all the fiat ads that are around.

Why do "easily changed" have to be a bad thing? You could make similar silly sayings the other way as well like "difficult to change, difficult to fix". They are all just buzzwords.
@_date: 2017-05-01 05:03:52
None of your arguments made any sense. Explain to me how more users = Bitcoin doing something better than other coins? Or explain how more developers = Bitcoin doing something better than other coins can do? It makes absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:11:50
If Bitcoin truly is headed for greatness, these things won't matter. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:11:34
It's all about that *deeecentralizaaatiooon.*
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:23:27
Can Bitcoin not be improved upon? If it can, and others are trying to do so, why wouldn't people also be open to invest in those ventures?
@_date: 2017-05-07 19:09:15
I agree. Bitcoin can do it all, because it's perfect. Why would anyone try to make something great with this amazing new technology that is blockchain? *No one* that's who. Well, except for all the scammers of course./S

I'd rather deal with the tax man as a result of profits, than not having any at all, other than the raw increase in price. If you think that's too much work, that's fine, but for some people it's not too much work to have to deal with taxes.

Who's gonna give you a loan or insurance if we don't have large financial institutions? And who's gonna keep people's money safe? You'd have thieves coming to your grandma's house with a shotgun and a couple of plyers telling her to transfer all her Bitcoin. Who's gonna stop them? No one, and you wouldn't even be able to trace them either. Stealing Bitcoin would be as easy as syealing everyone's savings if they had all of it in cssh at home, and the thieves wouldn't even have to carry any of the money. They could just walk straight out of the country.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:48:41


Like we did in 2013/2014? That weren't the end of us. I'm not a fan of Ripple, but we have no idea where it could be in three years.
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:55:35
How would you be able to track them down through the blockchain? Can you, for example, find out who currently holds Bitcoin you've previously owned?
And this is not the same as stealing an ATM card and PIN number. 
- People don't hold all their savings on an ATM card. 
- They could easily be caught on a camera if they tried to use your card on an ATM machine.
- You could try to give them the wrong PIN. 
- They would have to carry cash and could potentially be caught with it.
- There's usually a limit for how much you can take out of an ATM.
- The cash they took out of the ATM would probably be marked.
- If someone stole from your bank account you would likely get that money back from the bank or their insurance. No one would give you your Bitcoin back.

Are we fucked August 1st then?
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:56:35


Teach me how, because I've only heard people talk about how anonymous Bitcoin is.


Never heard anyone ever do that before where I'm from. Can't find any information about a feature like that on either of my banks' website either.


Because no one was ever caught wearing a mask. Going to your grandma's house taking her Bitcoin would be a lot safer than stepping in front of a camera at an ATM with a mask on.


But you could.


Taking someone's Bitcoin would be a lot easier than kidnapping someone for several days, which would end up alerting the authorities. Taking someone with you like that could possibly leave a lot of traces as well, that you wouldn't have if you stole someone's Bitcoin.


Dollar bills have serial numbers. You never know which ones are being tracked. Chances are this wouldn't be a problem, but even still. You'd have a much harder time getting the money out of the country compared to Bitcoin.


Well, that's good. Who gives Bitcoin insurance and what does it cost? Might as well just have it in a bank at that point though, if you're gonna have to pay for having idle money, but that's just how I feel I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:39:20
So what you're saying is that if Bitcoin forks on August 1st, we'll have 42 millions Bitcoins? Because that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-06-24 06:57:16
ETH holders weren't affected by this.

Buy low, sell high? Easier said than done, but viewing "buy low, hodl high" as the ultimate strategy is kind of silly. I like the sentiment, but lets not pretend it's the best strategy.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:59:55
So we're only against governmental financial institutions?
If someone came to your house right now with a shotgun and plyers, willing to murder you and every single one of your family members currently in the house, how would any amount of security prevent them from getting the information they needed from you in just a few minutes? And when they are your Bitcoin is gone, how would you track them?
