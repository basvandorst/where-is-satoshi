A configurable time-out makes sense to me, but I'm no expert. If the recipient really cannot or does not want to receive the funds, why should they not revert back? Whether the double-spend rule is enforced after single-signing or double-signing, no double-spend is possible, while still ensuring that the recipient has accepted the transfer. WRT spam transactions, there are a nearly infinite number of ways to create those, and it's not obvious to me that requiring two signatures makes the issue any worse.

Anyone technically competent enough to be playing with Bitcoin could set up a public tumbler in an evening. They'd be profitable, too, since you take a percentage, and have to do almost no work. For extra profit, shut down at random intervals, keep the money, then start a new one under another name. So why did the previous ones stop operating? Why do the existing ones take extensive precautions against being found? Why aren't there thousands of these? Why haven't you created one already?
Now, I don't have personal knowledge as to the motivations of former and current tumbler operators. But I have skimmed the wikipedia page on laundering, and that was enough to convince me that it's not something I would want to do. It's a pretty reasonable supposition that other intelligent actors reached the same conclusion. You don't have to be convinced, of course. But do chat with a lawyer before you go live.

Bitcoin lending will never get going, because the designer(s) thought credit was evil, and that deflation was good. To lend, you need to know who your counterparty is, not just have a digital signature. Bitcoin was designed around digital signatures being the only definition of identity. The real problem is deflation. Lenders need a return above the deflation rate, and above the repayment risk premium, plus something more to deal with volatility, to make a profit. For Bitcoin right now, the necessary interest rate would be huge. But borrowers don't want to pay high interest rates, and they too have to deal with volatility. So there's no demand, except from people who would simply abscond with your coins and never pay you back. So: no credit economy can exist for Bitcoin, exactly as designed from the beginning.

PayPal is great, if you fucking read and obey the ToS. For physical goods, obey the rules and both buyers and sellers get insured by PayPal out of the PayPal fee. Works fine for digital goods too: the model is that the digital good is something like a download of a song you wrote, where a chargeback is simply a lost sale and costs you nothing out of pocket. It's totally inappropriate as payment for an irreversible digital signature, like a cryptocurrency transaction. If you can't be bothered to spend 5 minutes reading a ToS for a real currency transaction service, you probably shouldn't be playing with cryptocurrency at all.

The USG *likes* Tor, and doesn't give a shit about torrent. Tor gives a bit of anonymity to foreigners in oppressive nations, that's why the USG built it in the first place. Torrent is an mild economic annoyance for some US *companies* (not the government!), but even for them not that big a deal. But while Tor gives some anonymity from typical attackers, don't think it gives anonymity *from* the USG. What fraction of Tor nodes are in fact being run, controlled, or tapped by the US government? Not all, certainly. But almost certainly enough that, when they want to, they can unmask a sufficiently high value target.

Your first statement is incorrect. A 51% attack has nothing to do with a court-ordered code patch.
So your answer is "a fork".

Or the community could work to avoid a fork, which basically amounts to everyone accepting the judge's patch.

I'm not actually proposing anything, I'm asking the question. But I'm not convinced that more users -&gt; more stability. There's probably enough data in the bitcoin record alone to test that -- there are thousands of times more users now than there were a few years ago. Bitcoin is worth more, but I don't think the price volatility has gone down.
I agree that a hard pin against some particular fiat or basket by direct buying/selling isn't easy, unless you have a large supply of both bitcoin and fiat to work with. And if your attempted pin is sufficiently wrongheaded, the market will simply push until they've exhausted your supply, like how George Soros broke the Bank of England. There are other levers, though. Increasing the monetary supply for instance. This could be done with the original bitcoin blockchain by upping the 21M cap, and distributing more to miners. Or by the creation of new blockchains. This is already happening, with the proliferation of various cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin etc.

Not hyperbolic. Functional anonymity, irrevocability, and possession of a key being the sole definition of identity are core values for Bitcoin. Together they ensure that scammers can not only be successful in the short term, as would be possible using any financial system, but actually keep their ill-gotten gains long-term. Creating an ecosystem for scammers was not the design goal of bitcoin, but it is a natural consequence of other design goals.

Want to place a bet that Mr. Buffet would take seriously? It has nothing to do with the market price -- markets can stay irrational for long periods. Instead, make a bet on the economic value of the cash flows owned by the owner of the asset. 1 year of profits, according to accepted accounting standards, for Berkshire Hathaway vs. whatever you own when you own 300 Bitcoins. Under those terms, Mr. Buffet himself might take you up on the bet. But by proposing to bet on market price, you show that you have no idea what value investing is, or why anyone might do it.
EDIT: OP is proposing betting against BTC - I misread the post. My basic point stands: BTC is not a claim on a cash flow, but a stock or bond is.

Thanks for the reply, and thank you for the tip! Now I'll have to go figure out how to receive it.
I'm not convinced that numbers of users alone, or duration, is sufficient for price stability. There have been lots of asset price bubbles where the good was held by very large numbers of people; but if they all change their minds simultaneously, the price can change rapidly. On the other side, there are markets where the good is traded by a small number of participants, but if the players view of the good's value is stable, then the price is stable too.
I agree that distribution matters. One thing that could totally change the dynamic of bitcoin pricing is if some sufficient number of the large holders, and there are lots of coins in a few hands, started to value price stability and began open market operations to increase it. They would be acting kind of like a central bank does for a traditional currency, a market maker for a stock, or as Saudi Arabia does for oil. They might even end up making money, since they'd be buying the lows and selling the highs, but making money would not be the point, increasing the usability of the currency would be the point. They could also play the central banker's game of preannouncing what their goal is, and letting the market do their work for them. Given the political history of bitcoin, though, I suspect the last thing any of those bitcoin-rich early adopters would do is to want to play central banker.
Thanks again.

Anything you're buying in the hopes its value will increase, whether you plan to hold for the short term or long. Things you buy in order to use or own wouldn't count, though. For example, my house has gone up in value, but I bought it to live in, so this wasn't a speculation. Some things could go either way: someone might buy coins or art just to own or look at, and someone else could buy the same thing in hopes of selling it for more later.

What? All of these ways are "hacking the machine". Your money is gone, why do you care whether or not the attacker cheated while doing it?
But you want three ways. Dimestore lens, increased image size, increased image distance, interrupt power partially or fully at interesting points in transaction, couple with social engineering attacks ("the machine ate my money!"), physical manipulation of the internals, feed the machine counterfeit bills, etc etc. Note that none of these could conceivably work against traditional financial system ATMs, but all of them have the possibility of screwing users or providers of Bitcoin ATMs.

As long as you're not actually laundering money, or transmitting money above the amounts requiring a license/documentation, you should be fine. People breaking laws in the US, however, don't (and shouldn't!) get a free pass just because they are using a nifty new Internet currency. I recall reading somewhere that they started targeting Localbitcoins in Florida because they'd noticed a significant amount of drug money being moved through there. If you're selling bitcoin, and know or could reasonably suspect that the payment is coming from proceeds of crime, don't do the trade. If you're selling enough bitcoin that you'd have to file AML paperwork if you were a bank, then you have to file paperwork too. Etc etc.

Distributed cryptocurrencies are cool, but they solve no practical problem for the vast majority of transactions. They also introduce large numbers of serious problems that do not exist in traditional financial systems. The hype will die down, as the media gets bored and moves onto something else. The useful ideas will get co-opted by the establishment, and some true believers will always remain. Schisms will arise, resulting in disagreement as to what is the One True Blockchain.

With respect to your "10 minute" estimate for using a Bitcoin ATM -- Bitcoin ATMs already exist, there should be no need to imagine how long they take. I've never used one, but I have watched a video. As I recall, 30 minutes is closer to the mark. And that's not counting the time to find one in the first place.

Of course he is right. Price stability is critical for a useful transactional currency. You won't get much support for that here, though, where everyone is hoping to get rich by letting bits sit on a hard disk, thinking that their ability to sign a transaction for them will be worth millions to someone someday.
There are a few ways to increase the coin supply. One is consensus changes in the protocols. If everyone thinks it's necessary, it's easy to do. Another is blockchain forks. Some folks go their own way, others follow, and voila, more coin to go around. Third is independent blockchains. The various types of coin, and newly created coin varieties, add to the total supply. In my view best would be a new coin with the possibility of price stability as an explicit design goal. It'd be easy to do: increase the mining reward whenever deflation becomes a problem.

Oh jeez, this is easy. Cheaper, faster, easier, nearly universally accepted, excellent support for marketers and consumers, no distractions from the sale of the product, less risk of fraud or loss, recovery mechanisms for those rare instances when it happens.
The only reasons to accept Bitcoin over PayPal: 1) You're selling something which is against the PayPal TOS. Some of these things are actually illegal, others are merely disreputable. 2) You're doing it as a marketing ploy, hoping to bring in new sales to fervent loyal Bitcoiners, who are themselves attempting to hype their new "currency". It's kind of like advertising a Christian business, in order to bring in the Christian fundamentalist customers. 3) You live in a benighted 3rd world country, without access to a modern well-run financial system.

Your lawyer is left trying to explain to a judge how, despite the fact that that money is now yours, indubitably and provably, you didn't really want it and couldn't stop it. With the evidence from the wire taps, and the transfer of funds, bail is denied. Government evidence is selectively leaked to the press. The Ministry of Homeland Security has foiled another terrorist plot. As you await your trial, do you still believe it's a good idea to blindly accept all money transfers? Do any other financial systems work that way? Checks don't. All traditional electronic transfers I've used don't. Indeed, convincing someone to accept a payment is the first step in one of the standard traditional financial system scams.

Bitcoin is deflationary and offers no consumer protection by design. Advocates believe these are good characteristics, but they do incentivize collecting bitcoin for investment purposes rather than using them for spending. The principal reasons to spend bitcoin are: 1) to help create the illusion of "adoption", to encourage the hype cycle and bring in new investors, and 2) to convert paper gains into tangible goods and services. 2) particularly makes sense for early adopters with large paper gains. For an ordinary consumer, there's rarely a purpose to purchasing bitcoin and then immediately spending them, traditional credit cards are cheaper, safer and more convenient.

No it's not paranoia.

But seriously, would you want a "federal trade commission" or "consumer protection bureau" to be able to force you to take on a customer? I thought Bitcoiners were libertarians, not statists. How would that work anyway - could they also set the price and other terms of the transaction?

Look up "value investing". It's not a coin toss, it's not a bet that there will be a greater fool around the corner. Buffet happens to be good at it, but people who don't overpay for things don't lose money.

So, for about €6, in about 15 minutes (assuming you had a modest walk to find the cash machine), you were able to do a currency exchange, transfer, and physical withdrawal of a small amount of cash across international borders. That's pretty cool. I remember when you had to do exchange currency before you left for a foreign country, or bring large amounts of funny pieces of paper (traveller's checks) and go get ripped off in weird offices during inconvenient hours. Modern electronic transfers are much cheaper and easier than the old ways, we all agree.
Now: do the Bitcoin comparison! How long will it take you to get a £20 note in your hand, starting with funds in your Spanish bank account, using the Bitcoin ecosystem? And how much will it cost? That's the real comparison. Show us it works better.

I can't speak for PayPal. And I can't speak for your jurisdiction. But in the United States, alcohol and tobacco products are not considered illegal drugs, so items associated with them would not be considered paraphernalia.

No, increasing supply is not the same as inflation. The term is defined in terms of price level of baskets of goods. Bitcoiners sound increasingly like advocates of creationism who continually redefine basic terms like "scientific theory".

So your institution could be utterly destroyed by the loss of any three of a group of 7? Nope, no risks in that that I can see. There's no way three people could be simultaneously killed in a car crash, or targeted by kidnappers, or just get pissed and all leave the company for a competitor at the same time.

Bitcoin Core is what Bitcoin-QT relies on, right? I've never tried to install Bitcoin Core by itself. I'm not sure why Bitcoin-QT didn't work - it never finished syncing, even with the provided torrented bootstrap. I had to delete my copy of the bootstrap, though, since my disk had filled up and I needed the computer for other things.

If MPex had measures in place to assure that they are not taking investment from US investors, they might be fine. You'd have to talk to a US securities lawyer to be certain. But if they didn't, they most definitely fall under US law. You can't just locate your investment scam across a border and expect everything to be fine.

Right, so the miners also face a risk that technological shifts will make their existing investments uneconomic. That's another risk that they'll have to be paid for, driving up costs again.


I was actually thinking of the traditional financial system. 
Others (I think Ben Laurie?) have pointed out that there's a degree of central control inherent in Bitcoin too. The shared protocol, the shared codebase, and discussions among the miner community all provide a common basis for what's accepted as a transaction and who's allowed to accept it. There has to be mutual coordination and understanding somewhere.

I wonder if that's true, even now. Worldwide banking systems do lots more than just verify transactions, so there's a question of making apples-to-apples comparisons. But banking systems have methods for verifying identity that do not involve proof-of-work, so they have a huge efficiency advantage. I note that no one is making specialized computer chips for traditional banking systems: they are able to make do with off-the-shelf servers. Bitcoin is so computation intensive that there are a number of companies producing specialized hardware, despite the relatively tiny size of the market.

I'm constantly astonished by the answers I get here. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty certain that a service whose sole purpose is to conceal a source of funds is illegal in just about every country on the planet. Have you ever even googled money laundering? Both running the service and using it seem suspect to me, but have a chat with your local financial crimes prosecutor to nail down the details. "Only a tool", sure, but lots of tools are highly regulated. Being casual about breaking major laws seems like a fast way to get into trouble.

Okay. But has anyone tried? There are estimates as to the size of certain businesses. Is the blockchain 99% noise, or only 50%?


How do you have a BTC transaction off-chain? I thought the chain was bitcoin, more or less.

Exchange it for something dense and valuable which is commonly exchanged for cash. One person suggested gold, but cocaine might be more convenient.

Is this right? I have a hard time believing that simply registering your company in a foreign country is a get-out-of-jail-free card if you're otherwise in violation of US securities laws. I suspect that you'd also have to make sure that you never illegally offered a security to a US citizen/resident.

Okay, I read the letter. I'm not convinced that the Bitcoin Foundation shouldn't be regulated as a money transmitter. The point of bitcoin is to move value around. When bitcoins are transferred from one user to another (including users in the state of California -- giving California jurisdiction) monetary value is transmitted. Claiming that there's no single entity promising to pay is kind of true, but this glosses over the fact that there *is* a single entity overseeing the entire ecosystem of the protocol and code. That entity is the Bitcoin Foundation... exactly who California approached for compliance. It makes much more sense for the regulators to be working with that central authority than individual users of the code.
I don't have a problem with the letter, it's a fine first draft as a response to the regulator's concerns, but the story by no means ends here. Even if their rules lawyering attempts to avoid regulation succeed for the moment, long term I'd expect the rules and legislation to cover things like bitcoin. As they should: there's a reason for these laws, and it's pretty easy to imagine ways for the unscrupulous to take advantage of consumers using virtual currencies.

Seriously? If someone steals a gold bar from me, sells it illegally to a jeweller who mixes it 50/50 with legitimate gold, then makes a ring out of it, then the ring contains no stolen property? I don't think that's how it works in the offline world. I'm not a lawyer, but I thought receiving stolen property was a crime in and of itself.

Really? The description of this group calls Bitcoin a "decentralized digital currency". The original Bitcoin paper refers to "a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash". No, it's not the officially issued currency of any nation. Neither are diamonds or gold bars, yet I don't think prosecutors have any difficulty establishing transactional value for them, for the purposes of anti-money laundering laws. As for which law specifically, there are a number listed at  You seem quite confident that mixing services are in compliance with all of them. I'd be interested if a financial regulator in any country would agree with you.

What fraction of the home-buyers in your community of 1000 are sitting on 450 BTC? If a buyer likes your place but doesn't already have the BTC, how are they going to get it? Can they get a bank to loan BTC for a mortgage on the house? It might make sense to find a local real estate lawyer and talk these issues through before going too far.

Right. So the illicit user ends up hoping that the mixing service or p2p purchaser isn't going to roll them. Seems like a big risk, but maybe that's why I'll never be a successful criminal. I have a hard time believing any of the mixing services are for real. Who wants to do 14 years for a 1% cut? 
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:38:35


Not directly, no, but indirectly it has to. It bumps up the cost of finding a block, so in equilibrium, the reward for finding a block (including transaction fees) has to increase.
@_date: 2013-06-07 21:24:23


Maybe I misunderstand the bitcoin protocol, but hypothetically speaking, what's to prevent the incumbent mining pools from collectively deciding to only accept blocks from each other? You could do all the solo mining you want, but if the incumbents don't accept blocks from you, it wouldn't do you much good. There's no 51% attack, since no entity controls more than half the network, they are simply limiting access to joining the network.

It's worth a shot, I guess. Clearly, you're bullish on BTC, otherwise you wouldn't be willing to take a 36% haircut (assessed value vs your ask) in exchange for getting BTC. But why not sell for cash, and use the cash to buy BTC on an exchange? And conversely for your proposed BTC seller, why would she not sell for fiat then use the fiat to buy whatever house anywhere she desires? I don't think liquidity is a concern: a 450 BTC transaction is easily absorbed by the MtGox market, isn't it? But if you really want it gone fast, use the most conventional currency, the most conventional sales methods (ie hire a real estate agent), and price your house well below market.

So every transaction has to clear out all of the input addresses. Interesting, though it feels weird somehow. I guess you can put the same address as an input and an output:
