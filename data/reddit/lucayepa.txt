I think it is too late to test version 0.9.1. Is it? If only someone had told me that nobody was testing it on Debian, I could had test it. It is really difficult to think that nobody was testing this open source project on Debian, while somebody was testing it on Windows. Do not worry, we are only using this software for Bitcoins: who cares about a solid operating system.

Really? Are you serious? Please give me a source where they say they did not test the software on Debian. Or are they ask for generic test? If you think that the point is to have 1000 beta testers "hoping" that someone does what you want, then we are writing about two different software development phases. A software as Bitcoin Core has to be developed on a secure and stable platform, and then maybe we have to wait and hoping that 1000 kids come and test it on Windows. This is not the last videogame.

A criminal is someone that violates some rule. The hacker of TheDao didn't violate any rule. Actually he used a well known agreement that everyone can see (TheDao contract). So I would not call him a criminal.

Don't keep them separate. Don't do anything anonymous that you would not do usually. Receiving money is not a crime. Doing something strange after you received it, can become a crime.

I've found this reddit post, with a portion of code. Was the code invented out of thin air, or was it part of the patched version of core?

You don't need to change the protocol. You just need to send your transaction to some miners privately. Try to contact a miner that is on the right side of the force and ask him if you can send some transactions by email. If the transactions are with a good fee, he should agree.
If you find such a channel, please let me know, as I'm interested to send (rich by fees) transactions as well.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:21:18
This document describes a protocol to manage digital assets (tokens) on top of the bitcoin blockchain. The protocol enables a semantic layer that permits reading the bitcoin transactions as operations related to tokens.
The protocol allows a new level of plausible deniability, while permitting statefull public auditability on each issued token. It allows both the user and the issuer to deny that an existing bitcoin transaction between the two is actually a token transaction, or a new token issuance. While both the token sender and the token issuer cannot deny to have sent bitcoins, nobody can prove the transaction was related to a digital asset. On top of that, to guarantee plausible deniability, tokens can be issued, sent, and received using any existing bitcoin client software.
There is no need to have a wallet exclusively dedicated to manage the tokens. With a few simple precautions by the user, tokens can be managed using any existing Bitcoin wallet, while it is used for normal bitcoin transactions as well.
Since it is possible to infinitely split a token in parts, there is no definition of the number of decimals of token generated and transferred. The number of tokens is always an integer.
Every operation of the protocol is performed with Bitcoin transactions, without the use of OP_RETURN and without any form of pollution of the blockchain, or of the UTXO set.
The protocol permits atomic buy and sell transactions between tokens and Bitcoin, and between different types of tokens. The only operations that require a coin selection enabled wallet are the split and join special operations and the token offering issuance operations. Those are used to modify the token unit of measure and to receive bitcoins from third parties during a token offering issuance.

If you have 500k USD value actually invested in USD, please sell them as soon as possible. Don't put your money in something not backed by anything. Return to more sound money, like bitcoin and never look back.

Since a lot of people use USD, you have the correct feel that you can buy the same things. USD collapsed with his economy as a whole. In a few years, this won't be a problem anymore. If you had a good currency (not printed for free), you could buy 131% more things.
