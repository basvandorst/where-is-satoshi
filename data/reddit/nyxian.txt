Actually, what I have found to be the most easy way is to [generate an address offline]( put the public address into blockchain.info - This lets you SEE the balance, but not spend it, which makes it easy to dump money into it, but even someone getting access to your entire blockchain.info wallet won't let them use it.
Then store the private key to that address securely, how you do that is up to you. Brain wallet's can work if you want to depend on a passphrase, writing the private key down on paper and keeping it in a safety deposit box works, or writing it down and keeping it buried in your backyard, if you are that kind of person.

Maybe my explanation was a bit off - I hit $80 into Blockchain.info, came up with a BTC amount, he looked at it and said that was good (I even covered the transaction fee myself) and once I hit send, he was off.
Anyways, this isn't the kind of reaction one would have if it was a dispute over a quarter or two because of currency fluctuation.
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:34:43
Oh, no offence taken at all, I understand. At this point, I probably won't be using BTC for local transactions like that, for large transactions, escrow  is the way to go.
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:47:57
Oh hell, what happened with PrimeASIC anyways? 
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:00:15
That is a precaution I should have taken, I agree, having the address and a verbal agreement may have helped, but it does come back to the same point though. He walks, and all I have is some spam email address with his agreement to use one wallet address, who's funds are quickly mixed and sent off, I don't know how much help it would be.

Thanks - And besides ranting, that is the other half of the reason I wanted to get this out there. I've seen a number of things about craigslist and bitcoin recently, and while I know I won't get my coin back, hopefully someone else will be more cautious than I was.
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:19:43
Fair enough, the transaction log and time *may* be enough. I'm still considering filing a report for the point of it, but I'm pretty sure any chance of prosecution is long out the window, all I have is an email, which is probably a throwaway, and a phone number, which may be a skype or google voice number, so I'm not hopeful, but I may give it a shot.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:03:01
I was watching charts constantly since $200. I didn't get worried about the smaller drops leading up to it, but after it hit $265-ish, and all downhill from there I decided to sell it. I think most of my coins closed at $240-250. I considered it both a huge absolute gain, and relative gain, so I would be happy no matter what.
I'll be honest and say I had no idea how far it was going to drop, I'm kicking back waiting for the right time to jump back in.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:49:37
Sorry, you are kinda right. I tend to think of the word "bitcoins" to mean any BTC amount, but I can also see that being read as 2+BTC, or almost $200.
@_date: 2013-03-21 07:07:44
That was a good read, thanks! Looks like the pretty picture has truth to it after all.
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:38:35
You need to have a friend mail you the blockchain. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:59:39
Wait, falkvinge is Rick Valkvinge, as in, [this guy]( 
Wow, hah, I had no idea.
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:29:52
I'm just amused you bothered to reply to an 11 day old thread, and say the same thing twice. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:08:26
A very small portion, normally under 1% at the moment. Fees for a block are about .1-.5BTC per block, with the reward being 25BTC.


Since it is such a large value (amount of BTC) and many of the coins were fairly old (How long since they were last moved), it go processed without a fee.
On the opposite side, as a counterpoint, if you have a small number of very recently moved coins, you will *need* a fee, otherwise the transaction will not complete.
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:49:51
Not NY - Philly. In regards to a contract, it might be a deterrent, but does anyone have any idea how BTC stands up in court? Has it come up in any way before?
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:53:51
Yeah, it is his word against mine - and I have the burden of proof, probably not much I could do.
In terms of double spending, while I did think of it (later) I would have to have a system all set up and ready to go to do that, which I didn't have at the time, and Blockchain wouldn't let me resend coins it already thought I spent.
Speaking of double spending - This of course raises the issue of if you are the party accepting payment of BTC, waiting with the person for ~10 minutes waiting for it to confirm, and nothing to say a reverse of this attack couldn't happen. I pay him in BTC, take the headphones, and doublespend before a confirmation hits.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:20:50
Wow - thank you so much. Seriously, happy fuzzy feelings that so random internet stranger cares


Will do man, will do.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:00:11
It doesn't need a fee. A transaction that large is accepted by practically every miner, regardless of a fee.
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:44:08
He was bigger than me. &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:12:15
That is the point of a mining pool....
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:30:21
Yes. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 06:44:01
I'll be honest and say I did no fact checking (Beyond a karmadecay search to see if it popped up yet). Anyone here want to run the numbers to see if this is total BS or not?
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:38:17
This isn't true. You can backup an encrypted copy of your keys to your computer, or download the chrome application, which doesn't even need blockchain.info to be online to use.
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:07:55
You're entirely right. I'm actually still curious myself how it would have turned out otherwise - Would he have just done the transaction per normal, with cash? Would he have not followed up on a cash deal, and only put "I am willing to accept BTC" rather than "BTC required" to come off as less suspicious? 
Hell, was this just an impromptu, spur of the moment "You know, that guy has no proof at all, look at this, I can just walk out of here right now", or was it a premeditated thing?
Ah, questions questions. Regardless, I will both check craigslist for similar posts, similar items, and see if there is anything I can do, but it's 4AM and I'm probably off to bed soon, so for another day. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:21:11
It was a "decent" deal, a reasonable price for a used item in good condition. I've purchased and sold many things locally, mostly being electronics, with no issues.
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:09:30
I expect that would be easier than having two entirely different wallet programs. Plus, blockchain.info interface is nice and easy to use. And even if they have their main stash in a local client, that doesn't protect you any more than the main stash in blockchain.
A local stash via QTbit and a blockchain wallet are the same level of security. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:01:23
Hit the six month chart. Crazy right?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:11:38
I feel bad for whoever I sold to at $250. Waiting for the crash to stop to jump right back in. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:48:32
I found it as a reply to a thread on some bitcoin forum. :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:46:07
Ouch. Hopefully your original buy in price, or mining price, wasn't too high. I entirely think it will be good in the long run, I'm just looking for a short term increase in my absolute number of bitcoins. Currently, looks like I'll be getting back in with 2.5-3.5 times more coins.
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:05:57
Looks like it, and using escrow would probably just make using cash easier then.
I know that bitcoin shouldn't be used as instant payment, but since I was (Or, I thought) I was on the "controlling end", and I had no intention of scamming him, that it didn't matter if he wanted to wait for 1 confirmation or not.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:54:32
I don't even bother to encrypt the "wallet" I just store the private key in a PNG image.
Images / text documents encrypted, of course. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:22:48
I'm still considering filing a report for the point of it, but I'm pretty sure any chance of prosecution is long out the window, all I have is an email, which is probably a throwaway, and a phone number, which may be a skype or google voice number, so I'm not hopeful, but I may give it a shot.
And I would love to do something about this is small claims, but at this point, it is probably less of a question of "how", and more of a "who" question.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:11:49
Why are we making this comparison in the first place? It doesn't make sense. You don't compare currency to companies, they are two entirely different concepts. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:29:48
I won't make him right - I was initially going to just write it off, but I've been convinced by the overwhelming support to *do something* about it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:00:07
Sold at $250. Will buy back once the crash is done.
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:22:45
It had no prior transactions, and the only two are my incoming, and one outgoing to mix it.
And for all we know, he sent the request to mix it from a anonymous connection to have it sent to a cold brain wallet. Okay, *that* is over thinking things, but the point stands. :P

Yes, you can run off a GPU that is not connected via any monitors, hell, it doesn't even have to match the brand of the first card in any way (Nivida / ATI card in the same system, for example, with ATI mining). Drivers get a little messy, but it works. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:21:44
You are correct. Mining is SHA, keys are ECC.
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:29:47
Eh, real funny isn't it?
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:45:06
I agree, and I know doing local transactions on craigslist has the risk for runners, but in that case, I knew I would at least have some legal defense - He would physically have my cash on his person, he would have (hopefully) been seen taking cash.
In this case, I doubt he would even have a fraction of the cash on him (if this was premeditated, as I suspect) to look very innocent. How can I claim he stole $80 from me when he has $10 in his wallet? 
Hell, at least if it was cash I would be able to take it back if it came to that. 
Well, [maybe I can get the BTC back, it would just be a bit more difficult]( 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:30:11
Two options? I didn't pick either, they both have their place. Diversified assets man. BTC, USD, Euro, Silver, Gold, Copper, yada yada.
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:36:39
The best way to think of a "shared send" or "Mixing service" would be to think of a bank. They have many individual bills, with different serial numbers. 
Let's say you have a $100 bill, that has a serial number on it, and an outside party KNOWS this serial number, and is waiting to see what you do with it. Rather than spending it, you walk it into a bank, deposit it, then get out another $100 bill, with a different serial number. The outside party doesn't know what bill you have now, and your old bill is with the bank, which will be given out to someone else, sometime.
