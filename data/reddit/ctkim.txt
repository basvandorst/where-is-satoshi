I have an ecommerce store where I do some importing from China. This is the main reason I got interested in bitcoin. With wire transfers, I have a $30 fee and sometimes it can take a day or two for the seller to receive the funds. Whenever I talk about bitcoin to my friends, I always give the example of how easy it would be for me to pay my suppliers.

i'm not talking about security. moreso about the efficient market hypothesis. if the price tanked right after the etf denial, i would be saying the same thing.

I feel like markets react immediately to events rather than a slow long delay so the market has spoken on how they feel about the etf denial and it doesn't really care

going to have to respectfully disagree here. markets are efficient. the price in 1-2 weeks if changed will reflect new information, not the information that the etf has been denied.

Why do you say that? You cant trust the USA government itself to not start a war. The US is the one who starts conflicts and started the military complex.

No I'm with you. I should have clarified my sentence better. It introduced a lot of people to business concepts they had not thought about before.

nice. just donated!

I have read it. When the book first came out, it introduced a lot of people to new business concepts. Harnessing the power of the internet to test your business ideas. Outsourcing your work overseas. Automating and building systems and processes for your business.
 It changed a lot of people's thoughts on how to make money as well as run their business. And I currently do live that lifestyle. Currently traveling long term in Europe right now while working from my laptop. 
It does have a click-baity title though, I will give you that.
