Just because they don't already have a Bitcoin wallet doesn't mean they're not interested or willing to learn. A lot of people have heard about Bitcoin but haven't wanted to do anything with their knowledge because they forget/didn't know how to get started. Our service not only provides an easy way for them to get started, but also the proper knowledge to actually do something with their Bitcoin. 
We're working on a way to return to the sender as I type this.

You know how they say that kids learn from their parents? 
That's because their parents are the first ones to tell them about everything. It's the same no matter who tells you something. He probably heard something bad about Bitcoin and now believes that it's horrible. 
The way that I'm trying to explain Bitcoin to people now is by comparing it to a stock. That's the one thing that the guy in the video got right- Bitcoin is very volatile. So I compare it to a stock, another thing that is very volatile, yet more well known. 
When making a big purchase, a lot of people will sell some of their stocks in order to pay for that item. So basically they're paying for their items with that volatile item- stocks. 
When purchasing an item with Bitcoin instead of going from Bitcoin to local currency to purchase, you go from Bitcoin to purchase. It's like you're losing that extra step, and *with it*, you're also losing the fees and the transaction times. 
If more people are being educated properly the **first time**, they'll be less likely to turn away.

Alright. Anyways, I'm sorry for arguing, I've just had to put up with a lot of trolls today, and I'm at my wits end. And we have all the hardware already lined up and ready to purchase. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:36:53
That's not a subreddit...
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:43:43
Thanks for the kind words :) 
@_date: 2014-07-21 17:00:55
We were trying to show how our ATM can work with multiple different crypto currencies, and yes, I believe that the horrible video quality has already been established. If you have any other comments or questions please PM me.

Mind tipping my project? Tippr.org. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:09:56
Andreas is more knowledgeable than most people when it comes to Bitcoin security. I personally trust his judgment on a lot of things, however I don't *completely* trust anyone. I'd rather check the source code out myself. So, all of you, stop complaining about Andreas and go submit a pull request. If you're a Bitcoin user you shouldn't rely on someone to check the code for you. Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin decentralization? 
@_date: 2014-07-23 12:03:51
Haha yeah I'm not the best at math and science, in fact, I suck at math and science. English and History I'm really good at though. Oh well- you win some, you lose some. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 19:37:07
No Bitcoin is ever stored on the Tippr servers. At all. The app generates a wallet on Blockchain.info sends the user all the information they need to know to access the wallet. 
Responding to your comment about the WHOIS email... most people use an email which they check very frequently as their WHOIS email. Also, as another commenter said, you should probably update your WHOIS email. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:21:58
Uhhhhh... a dog? :P
@_date: 2014-11-02 20:05:38
I'm fine with this, as long as you're not related to Alex Green. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:56:35
Oh wait you don't get it? It's more than just software. We include hardware too. And unlimited support. And as a sophomore 12th grade honors math is pretty intense. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 21:24:16
We don't include any attachments in the email. So hopefully that won't be an issue. I'm currently looking into a way to return the Bitcoin to the sender. Thanks for all your suggestions. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:38:07
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:58:40
Just Googled that. They look cool haha. It is industry standard hardware, but custom made and designed for the project itself. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:19:32
Sadly, no. We had to work with what we got. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 20:00:31
Did you just come here to troll? :P I'm open to positive criticism, and I'll definitely use it to make the project better but I don't see your point here... 
@_date: 2014-07-21 17:31:24
Thanks so much for the support! 
@_date: 2014-11-25 23:01:18
That's genius. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 18:25:29
I believe I mentioned it in an earlier comment, we're working with ex-creditunion people who know the system to make sure it works out :) 
@_date: 2014-12-28 02:43:39
PM me. I created BitSell ATM (semi-popular, well received by the media) and I could help you release this in a big way. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:46:00
What do you mean, off the shelf? 
@_date: 2014-12-14 17:25:20
Why would you ever use Google products?! ownCloud for the win!
@_date: 2014-07-21 18:23:34
Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-08-30 18:56:55
There are actually some pictures on my Twitter. You can check them out  I need to get around to uploading them to the site. I'll be doing that tonight. The license keys are $50 a piece, and the hardware is $125. However, if you have a spare tablet lying around you can run the software on there and you don't need to buy the hardware from us. Any other questions?
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:18:04
Your site looks awesome! I'm an actor, and tea drinking is like a ritual for us. Are there any types of tea you'd recommend that help soothe a soar throat? 
@_date: 2014-12-31 20:04:03
The coins are stored in a Blockchain.info wallet generated specifically for that user. Unless we were to save the wallet login information from the JSON response we wouldn't be able to do that. I will look into other options now though. 
And yeah, definitely. Feel free to make any pull requests! 
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:47:41
Most of my friends are either into sports or theater, since that's what I do a lot of haha. But they think it's pretty cool! 
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:59:24
I know. Some people are just extremely obnoxious about it. Oh well. Thanks for the complement though :) 
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:34:44
Don't you have somewhere to be, Rafi? 
@_date: 2014-12-31 19:31:55
There's currently no way to send the Bitcoins back to the person who sent the tip if the tip is declined, because no Bitcoins are stored on our servers at all. The wallet is generated and the Bitcoins are sent directly to the address. However, the "Contact Us" page is a great idea- thanks! I'll take a look at that tonight. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 02:50:55
Hey don't hate on PHP. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:48:43
If you'd like to pay for a photographer to come take professional headshots for that I'd be very open to that idea. We were trying to show what we looked like, and that we're fun people. This is a hobby to us. We're enjoying ourselves, looks like you should try that sometime! 
@_date: 2014-11-02 04:42:30
I have literally nothing in Bitcoin at this point, but as I soon as I can get some more money I'll be putting it right into Bitcoin :) Cheers. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:46:33
Hey there buddy! We're doing more than that, but if you'd like to make an ATM during your spare time in the summer and during the school year while taking all honors classes in your sophomore year (me) and taking physics and honors 12th grade math in your sophomore year (Sagar) then by all means, go ahead. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:36:28
Cool! If you'd like to collaborate on this, PM me. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 19:30:55
Thanks for the suggestions! I'll get to work on the FAQ and the JavaScript QR codes when I get home. There's currently no way to send the Bitcoins back to the person who sent the tip if the tip is declined, because no Bitcoins are stored on our servers at all. The wallet is generated and the Bitcoins are sent directly to the address.

This is the *digital* future, right? :P
@_date: 2014-12-10 11:59:27
I'm going to look into this :) 
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:54:37
Like I said before, we're working with ex-creditunion people who really know their stuff. However, I'll let you know a little bit more. The built in camera will be always recording and live streaming to the ATM owners dashboard. Similar to what normal ATM's do. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:00:29
This isn't exactly an ATM. I'm not saying it's not an awesome idea- I think it's great. But it should be called a merchant solution. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:13:44
That's impossible! [The CEO of Bitcoin committed suicide awhile ago.](
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:42:59
Thanks for your comment, we're working on it! 
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:48:12
As long as you use proper security measures. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:43:45
Also, they're in store and (should be) up at the counters. And we have cameras running on them all the time. If they're on, the purchase is being recorded. In addition, we plan on integrating signature verification for each purchase. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:41:00
Hey there. Thanks for being the person who actually provides valuable feedback :) I'm Lakota Lustig, the co-founder. You're completely right about the rushing of the prototype and the video. We'd like to assure you that the final product will look nothing like that. The real reason we rushed it is to get the Indiegogo campaign up and the first batch of orders out the door before the summer ends and we have to get back to school and the daily grind. The actual product will be made of metal and a new prototype will be shown on our blog. We're running extremely low on money, I mean- we're high school students. But with the money from the campaign, we'll actually be able to work on a beautiful prototype. If you'd like more info on the product appearance, please PM me. And about the payments, (sorry if this stuff is a little out of order, I'm just writing it as it comes to me), it's not only NFC based. I just wanted to show that off for the video. You'll be able to type in your credit card information. Also, chargebacks wise in working with ex-credit union employees to make sure I find ways to avoid those issues.

Have you ever heard of multi-sig or?... 
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:45:24
We also plan on setting aside part of our budget for reimbursement in case something horrible like that were to happen and the camera malfunctioned or something. We'll have you covered :)

Yup. Someone mentioned it awhile ago so I figured I'd work on it as a side project. I'm sorry to hear you don't find it useful... is there anything I could do to change your mind? 
@_date: 2014-12-31 18:21:14
As stated on the website, an email is sent to the website owner's WHOIS email with an explanation of Bitcoin- what it is and how to use it, and how to claim their bits. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 19:39:04
Nice idea! That's another one I'll add to the features list :P
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:50:09
It's the Bitcoin Center in NYC. It's actually pretty cool- I filmed an interview there for my company there!
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:05:37
Exactly. Looks like I won't be registering my Altcoin ATM as a business... 
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:01:16
We don't currently offer hardware. You can run this software on any tablet, phone, or old computer in a web browser. That's the beauty of BitSell... *anyone* can run an ATM.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:04:24
I've been calling them Bitcoin ATM's... guess I should do my research :P And these ATM's (or BTM's I guess) use PayPal to process payments for Bitcoin purchases so that pretty much covers KYC, or so we've been told.
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:48:55
We at Tippr agree, and as mentioned in the edit above, we've now instituted a one week return policy. If the tip isn't claimed within one week, it'll be returned to the sender. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:07:21
Circle is super reliable (for smaller amounts). For larger amounts, I'd suggest buying from a Bitcoin ATM or localbitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:02:35
That sounds pretty cool! We have yet to mess around with a RaspPi over here at BitSell, but it's been an idea we've had since day one. Let us know how it works out! All you need is a web server :)
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:40:51
Sure there's a little bit of sarcasm in your answer, but I don't see why you're being downvoted. This is actually a valid point...

What is Bitcoin?
'Bitcoin is a digital currency used to pay for a variety of goods and services. In many ways, it works the same as paper money with some key differences. Although physical forms of Bitcoin exist, the currency's primary form is data so you trade it online, peer to peer, using wallet software or an online service. You can obtain Bitcoin's either by trading other money, goods, or services with people who have them or through mining. The mining process involves running software that performs complex mathematical equations for which you're rewarded a very small portion of a Bitcoin. When you actually have some of the currency, you can then use it to purchase anything that accepts it.'
