If they didn't have the money, why would they print $1.5 billion tethers after being subpoenaed?

I started putting money into Bitcoin as an alternative to keeping it in a savings account. What else are you going to do with that $300? So my answer is yes.

So what percentage of that 1 million is actually real volume, and not Bitmex trading their own books hey.

Those dumbasses who bought in 2013 and held. Bunch of idiots. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:47:17
It’s not wash trading I’m talking about. Bitmex themselves have admitted that they have market makers trading their own books.

If you bought in low, then it still makes sense to hold. If, like me, you bought in quite recently, the late nights staring at the charts, being unable to sleep and watching money I worked hard for slip away whilst clinging on to some false hope that it will pick up, became too much. 
I wanted to buy in to the idea of bitcoin as something new that could change the way we do things, and honestly I thought it would help grow some of my modest savings too. 
Bitcoin has changed my life, not for the better.

I like the black and white circled S better. Looks a lot simpler and cleaner. Easy to recognize with a quick glance.

Your grandparents saved that money for you. Have a little respect, don't treat it as play money, and sensibly buy bitcoin if that's what you really want to do. 
Listen to the people saying not to buy all at once, this is advice often repeated with good reason. You're very unlikely to be buying at it's lowest point, it will go down. So spread it out.

Stocks and shares are an established form of investment. It's not the same thing psychologically. 
Even if someone doesn't own any, they are more likely than not familiar with the concept. And there are many different options to choose from.
Bitcoin is something new that most people don't really understand. It's often hard for people in this sub to get a grasp of the barriers this new fangled internet money presents to the average Joe.

I think it's a good idea. When you introduce new non-savvy people to Bitcoin, they often are apprehensive about the price of 1. 
People don't want to start out by owning a fraction of something, and many people aren't comfortable putting a sizable chunk of money into something that's new to them.
I think it's better to do this before the volume of retailers accepting Bitcoin starts to (rapidly) increase.

How about a Bitcoin ATM? I just did a quick google search and it seems there are companies that provide Bitcoin to Fiat with locations around London.

There's a genuine FUD campaign going on in the Korean market about 'Satoshi's true vision'. Koreans tend to stick to the forums and groups in their own language, where this message is really being pushed as a big issue. 
I think the guys behind BCH have targeted the Korean message boards and groups specifically. 
Earlier in the year they were heavily trading and pumping ETC 'The Real Ethereum', and pumped it up to $50. ETC is still massively traded in Korea now, and I don't think it's a coincidence that Barry Silbert is involved.. being behind both ETC and the NYA, and is also a big investor in Korean exchanges.
FOMO is a part of it too. Koreans seem to act like sheep and all jump in after one another when prices and volume starts to spike. A lot of the time the reasoning makes no sense outside of the Korean bubble.

I'd like to know too, despite the likelihood. 
Why has nobody answered the question?

I want to know the answer to the technical question the OP asked. It doesn’t matter if it happens or not. All I keep seeing is “it’s not gonna happen”.

Actually you are along the right lines, and this is not about saving face. Jihan is purposely being careful about alienating the public to BCH, and the timing of his tweets after a long period of silence speaks volumes. BTC has undergone a coordinated PR and price attack from the Ver/Wu camp in the last 24 hours.

Many people still associate Bitcoin with news stories about hacking and malware, criminal use etc. But seeing Bitcoin ATM's around, may make people question their pre-conceived ideas. 
It's good marketing, and does push a more positive crypto sentiment, as you suggest. The UK is not the friendliest place for converting fiat to crypto easily too.

So Litecoin hasn't lost 20% of its value in the last 8 days?

Most altcoins can only be bought with BTC on Exchanges such as Poloniex. So people wanting to buy altcoins, first need to move cash into BTC.

I hate that the charts on bittrex are so slow to update. I want to see what's happening on the charts in real time.
