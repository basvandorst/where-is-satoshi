The odds that 800k coins were drained through the malleability bug are very low.  Exploiting the malleability bug requires repeated withdrawals of BTC.  Mtgox has a database of its customers and withdrawal limits.  It would take a large number of accounts and a large amount of time to withdraw 800k, and all the while it would be throwing up super obvious redflags everywhere, from any casual inspection of the database whatsoever.
We also know, as a fact, that Mtgox already has had funds seized by the USGov (as part of the original silk road debacle).
The more likely explanation is that Mtgox has lost access to its cold wallet which involved usb keys or paper wallets in a bank vault.  The bank was probably informed to hold the keys or release them only to Jap/US authorities due to international investigation, and now its in a legal mess.
Essentially the feds have reason to believe some portion of the Mtgox bitcoins were involved in illegal activity and that gives them a claim to them.

Most bitcoiners have grown up in a financial system that ultimately relies on civil and criminal penalties to maintain a workable game-theoretic equilibrium.  The default assumption is that a financial service with a good reputation and a reputable-looking website is probably a safe place to store wealth.
Tis a dangerous assumption of course in bitcoin-land, but didn't we all know this?  
The surprising thing isn't that mt gox imploded, its that it still had so many users by the time it did.

The article's argument is a joke, it completely oversimplifies the vast space of potential digital ledger designs into a few narrow categories.  
There are potential 'appcoin' designs that can function like stock shares in distributed organizations that derive value from their decision power.  If the organization/software is successful (provides economic value) it can use that economic value to acquire other currencies (such as bitcoin/usd/whatever) or resources and then trade those in for its own 'appcoin', just as corps now buy back their shares.  Even if nobody else in the world wants to hold the 'appcoin', it will attain value proportional to the economic power or wealth of the appcoin's issuer.

Software in all its various forms - the precursors to strong AI, are steadily making most human workers completely superflous.  Eventually human brains will be economically unviable - human work will be completely unecessary. 
Already today our industrial system requires only a relatively small percentage of smart humans to do the real work - an increasing portion of human workers literally do nothing and get paid for it or do meaningless work that could be automated today but isn't purely for political reasons.
This transition is accelerating - exponentially - until eventually the idea of a simple biological human mind contributing to the economy will be nonsencial.

Sure - an 'appcoin' could be implemented on any type of ledger - in theory.  Running a practical large scale company and making it trustworthy (replacing the legal system) is a huge amount of work and the current systems are nowhere near capable enough - its early days.
There are a bunch of interesting tradeoffs and they are just starting to be explored.  None of the systems have really solved scalability to the level where we could run the world's financial markets on a blockchain.


Bitcoin the *currency* is not really relevant for using the bitcoin code/ledger to represent units in a virtual corporation - its a different use case.  A clone of bitcoin would work just as well.

What do you qualify as 'outright disaster'?
There are only about 1-2 million bitcoiners world-wide who have enough BTC to use as a checking account equivalent for shopping.  So very roughly, at the outset we should expect BTC sales should be about 1/1000th of fiat sales.
You get a very similar ratio if you look at money supply market cap of BTC vs fiat - BTC is roughly 1/1000th of the USD or the EUR.
Anyone who was expecting anything more than a *realistical, proportional* tiny fraction of BTC sales was failing some basic math.
BTC is a tiny currency - it needs to grow by at least one more order of magnitude in value before it will be anything but an accounting blip for major online retailers.

Bitcoin subsidizes mining - the new coins go to miners.  Inflationcoin - (presuming it just tweaks bitcoin to have permanent inflation) would subsidize miners just like bitcoin.  The difference is that in bitcoin the mining subsidy eventually drops to zero, where with inflationcoin it will be stuck at some significant amount (say 3%) forever - thus subsidizing mining forever.
The amount of world GDP spent on mining is thus capped in bitcoin, but not for inflationcoin.

It is somewhat nonsensical to think of money in nominal terms.  One should think of money's value in proportional terms, as a share of the nation's savings/GDP.  In this case a single dollar is currently something like 3 pico-percents of the US economy.  
The US government currently funds about 30-40% of its operations via issuing new dollars, so each dollar annually loses % share in proportion.
This gives an extra incentive to invest out of dollars in something else (real estate, stocks, etc) - and as a result we collectively hold less savings/investment in dollars than other choices.
In a BTC world the proportional value of each BTC would be much more stable, and as a result other major value items (such as real estate) would have stable long term prices.
There's only a strong incentive not to spend BTC during a transition from a dollar to BTC economy.  If the BTC monetizes and replaces the dollar/euro etc, then people will hoard it during the transition.  After the transition the value of goods as measured in BTC units will stabilize and there will be no further additional incentive to 'hoard' - as one BTC will be always and forever at least 50 millipercent of world savings in such a scenario.
In that kind of world one BTC would buy a high end property in the present or the same high end property in the future - hardly a deflationary spiral.

The idea that inflation *actually* strongly influences saving vs spending decisions is hard to prove - it relies on the key assumption that the saver does not have substitute assets they can use to avoid the inflation tax - such as mortgage backed securities, gold ETFS, etc - merely creating bubbles without truly influencing behavior.

All it would take for bitcoin to become a primary currency is full adoption by at least one mostly self-sufficient economy - even if its a micro-economy.
At least two virtual bitcoin micro-economies already exist.  The first is a smallish tech enthusiast community that is willing to work for bitcoin - mainly on bitcoin and altcoin related projects.  The second community is the virtual blackmarkets.
The volatility of bitcoin is a direct consequence of its massive future potential and the inherent difficulty in estimating the likelihood distribution over future realizations of that potential.

Not for predicting new buying interest.  There are far more reasons why people will search for the generic terms such as "bitcoin" or "gold", adding the "buy" term narrows the results to those who are actually researching buying and has vastly more forward price predictive power.

This is a largely an outdated notion, because anything can potentially be used as a currency.
The obstacles to using stock shares or housing share units or any other asset as currency are *technological* obstacles that cryptographic p2p protocols can solve.
In the future I imagine that we will have savings portfolios that can transact directly on the network with software assistance.
So a customer walking into a store has some wealth allocation: 20% bonds, 30% bitcoin, 20% fiat, 30% real estate, etc, and the merchant likewise has their own distinct allocation.
At the time of purchase, the software on both sides sets up a trade that minimizes transaction costs while maintaining both agents wealth allocation strategy.  
This might involve trading a small amount of bitcoins and google shares for a cupcake, for example.
Currency is an idea built upon mental algorithms that can/will be supplemented and greatly extended by software.

It's only somewhat compelling if one of the parties also desires to hold bitcoins long term, and only really compelling if both do.
If neither party desires to hold bitcoin long term, the buyer needs to convert from fiat -&gt; bitcoin, then bitcoin transfer, and then seller does bitcoin -&gt; fiat.  When you factor in the volatility risk that must be hedged, this whole process is frankly just not an improvement over paypal/visa.
If one party is long bitcoin, then it starts to makes some sense, but its true advantages as a payment network are felt only when both parties are long bitcoin.

The economy can run just fine without any little stores - large megacorps can provide all of those services, usually more efficiently due to scale.
Whether that is desirable or not is a political issue, not an economic/technological issue.
Also, if bitcoin continues to take off, their will be plenty of small businesses sprouting up - all funded by bitcoin savings.

There is ample historical evidence that currencies form organically in free markets as a sort of shelling point, the result of some long running optimization.  In various points in time and space the dominant currency has been everything from seashells to tulips, but over most of history the global dominant currency has been gold.  No single nation or tribe decided this, it was more of a collective process.
Paper currencies all originated as bank issued gold-backed deposits (basically gold safety-deposit slips), which then became currencies in their own right (due to convenience/safety), which then became centralized and controlled by governments, and then much more recently became completely independent of gold.
But currencies start as investments.  Its been a long, long time since a currency has monetized itself out of nothing simply due to market dynamics, but there are some compelling technological reasons to believe we could see a new monetization event in the near future.

This is silly and naive.  I just spent BTC online and will spend more as it gets more convenient.
I have a savings allocation: a % of my net worth I want to hold in bitcoin, a % in stocks, a % in dollars, etc.  My purchase decisions are orthogonal to my savings decision.
Spending dollars or BTC doesn't effect that - I will spend whatever is most convenient/cheaper and then later adjust my savings allocation if it gets out of whack.
The idea that people will 'hoard' bitcoins (more so than they 'hoard' dollars in their savings account) is just stupid beyond belief.  It is such an outdated concept - economics really is stuck in the past.

The volatility risk can be hedged by a third party (such as bitpay) which then translates into some additional transaction fee.
Its the key consideration at the moment for merchants who want to use bitcoin only as a payment mechanism - whether the additional transaction cost due to volatility wipes out the transaction cost savings vs credit cards.
The big shift will come when some companies allow employees to take paychecks in bitcoin and then begin holding bitcoin reserves as part of their cash balance.  That will be the tipping point.

Bitcoin is effectively the currency of a new small fledging virtual nation - **Bitcoinia**.
This virtual nation is unique in that anybody connected to the internet can participate and become a citizen at any time (and leave just as easily).  As a consequence of this inherent flexibility and Bitcoinia's current tiny size, exchange rate volatility is expected as hot money from speculators flows in and out.
Prices should stabilize once Bitcoinia's future becomes more certain - it could either expand into a very large economy (and thus a very large fiat/BTC ratio), or it could peter out, or remain small.  
Nobody really knows - but the current exchange rates represent the market's current prediction over the distribution of outcomes.

Wow, that really could have used a TLDR.  Reading through your essay, I agree with about 90% of it, but the other 10% is crucial.
Bitcoin is most equivalent to 'high powered' dollars: MB federal reserves, rather than the FDIC IOU dollars in our checkings and savings accounts.
Some sort of fractional reserve system is possible in a Bitcoin future, but it will be necessarily highly constrained - because the supply of bitcoins is fixed and the banking system thus can not *possibly* be bailed out in a large scale panic/recession - its just not possible.
Fractional reserve bitcoins will be regarded with some suspicion simply because FDIC type insurance is impossible.  Any entity which gives you any interest on your bitcoin balance is taking on risk that simply can not be fully insured away, because ultimately the final insurance against widespread counter-party failure can not issue new currency to save the banks.


This is somewhat outdated concept - cash and deposit dollars are mostly interchangeable at this point because FDIC removes the convertibility risk.


Naive? Hardly - the naive view is to fail to understand the quantitative theory of money always involves supply in the denominator.  The total quantity of money is crucial for predicting prices.


You are failing to understand (or acknowledge) the key difference between bitcoin and dollars: the total fixed supply of the former implies long term price appreciation in terms of the bitcoin/dollar ratio in direct proportion to the steady exponential increase of dollar supply (M2).
Its not some kooky 'goldbug' idea, is it is a basic economic fact and the central key advantage of bitcoin in the long run.
Nobody would be investing in bitcoin if it didn't have a long term fixed supply and instead inflated at 5% per year like fiat currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:56:12
The bad news is merchants can't accept it as payment - hence Baidu and the rest pulling support.

Whether economists/governments like inflation is rather besides the point: it is an obvious tax on savers.
Smart, wealthy savers already avoid this tax: they invest most of their wealth in a diverse portfolio, which on the net can roughly achieve world GDP growth with low volatility.
This idea that we must heavily tax the savings of the middle classes is largely dependent upon them not knowing any better or not having a viable alternative.
Bitcoin is high yield/risk now, but if it becomes a major currency it will slowly evolve in to a benchmark asset that delivers a rate of return near world GDP growth combined with very low volatility.

Americans living overseas still have to pay some income tax to the IRS.  So by your analysis, would an American living in England insist on being paid in dollars instead of pounds?

The mechanism starts with consumer adoption, followed by large institutional investors and then eventually governments.
History shows that fiat reserve currencies are never stable: they pop up in an area when some sort of superpower gains hegemony.
The US's position as world economic superpower is not stable.  When the power is more evenly distributed (and checked by nuclear weapons), the equilibrium solution is a neutral reserve currency.

If someone is 100% confident bitcoin was going to go steadily up and up, the only rational strategy is to convert all your wealth into bitcoin.
In reality of course most of us aren't that confident so we allocate savings in a portfolio with some % in bitcoin, dollars, stock, etc.
Spending is totally orthogonal.  A rational agent may adjust consumption based on total expectation over the whole portfolio, but not based on one item in the portfolio.  When going to spend, it doesn't matter whether bitcoins or dollars are used from a savings perspective: a rational agent will use whatever is most convenient/lowest transaction cost and then rebalance the portfolio as needed.

Markets are at least semi-efficient.  The bedrock of good investment advice is to start with a diversified balanced portfolio which requires no special insights or knowledge about the future.  A proper 'benchmark' diverse portfolio has an expected return close to world GDP growth and very low risk/volatility.
Now, because markets are efficient, investing in any portfolio *other* than a diversified benchmark is essentially a gamble: you can only beat the benchmark/market if you have *special* insight.  Because the market is efficient, special insights are rare, and the game is zero-sum in terms of beating world-gdp (the average benchmark rate of return).
The idea that we (society) need (or even can) somehow tweak investment decisions by simply penalizing holding currency, and that this somehow can actually increase the net intelligence of the market, is just stupid beyond belief.  Its a political idea, not grounded in strong computational theories of market mechanics, encouraged for political reasons.
New businesses that have real potential are quickly priced by the market according to that potential, and this has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with inflation or anything under the control of monetary policy.
If/when bitcoin becomes a major world currency, it should achieve rates of return similar to world GDP growth combined with low volatility/risk - in other words it should become a benchmark asset.
Does this mean that somehow investment in new companies will slow down?  Of course not!  It will perhaps imply that creating the 'safe' zero-knowledge portfolio will be simplified - because holding bitcoins could achieve the benchmark portfolio with less complexity.
But any new startup or company that is underpriced with respect to its future potential is an arbitrage opportunity that professional traders will exploit.  The *only* people that can/should do this are those that actually contribute real novel computational knowledge to the market, making it more efficient.  Eventually AI's will do this (and we already increasingly moving in that direction).
The average saver in the future will/should just hold the safe benchmark portfolio (no matter if it is bitcoins or some index) - simply because the average saver is not capable of contributing to the computational intelligence of the market.

Well I'm not really sure of that, as I haven't really read much of Krugman.
Let me put it another way:  Where are the US, Euro, China and other major players heading economically in the next 30 years?  One or more of US/Euro/Japan may be essentially bankrupt/insolvent.  We have this whole huge debt/obligation structure that has many unrecognized dependencies - it basically amounts to an economic plan for the decades ahead.  If significant unanticipated shakeups invalidate that plan (such as strong AI), it could lead to a largescale default/debt deflation - and a rapid revaluation to a lower overall economic status.
Obviously they could print their way through it, but that can have varying outcomes.  If bitcoin monetizes rapidly into a reserve currency, it could also effectively shift wealth between nations (depending on how they play it and how quickly).

Inflation means wealth redistribution or savings tax.  Whatever entity is the beneficiary of the new issuance (whether it be shares, new dollars, or whatever) is taking value from all the holders of that asset.  
Corporations have to be careful about issuing shares, often it is done during startup phase and then when a corp gets big it maintains a roughly fixed supply (and sometimes buying back shares if necessary).
A government with an inflationary currency is like a corp that keeps issuing new shares indefinitely - which is obviously has a negative impact on the savers holding the asset (fiat currency).
Bitcoin is more like a corp that has precomitted to a fixed number of shares for its lifetime, which obviously is a boon for savers/investors.
Given the choice, a fixed supply currency is a hands down better asset to hold than an inflating currency, so all else being equal fiat currencies have a large disadvantage against Bitcoin in the long run.   (of course all else is not necessarily equal!)

The brain's algorithms for general problem solving are being reverse engineered, hardware parity is approaching soon, 20-30 years is a typical consensus estimate from AI researchers.

But thats really a separate topic for another subreddit.


The key property of bitcoin that is driving its success is that it is apolitical.  BitflationCoin (which already exists in various minor altcoins) has the problem that it subsidizes the mining algorithm into perpetuity, which is probably undesirable.
One of the better arguments against bitcoin is that if bitcoin becomes a major currency it will entail a staggering, vast subsidy expenditure on bitcoin mining.
For hypothetical example, if current 10x/year growth rates continue and BTC hits $1mill per coin or $12 trill market cap by 2016, that implies almost $1 trillion spent on bitcoin mining that year - considerably more than the *entire* semiconductor industry.
The saving grace is that such expenditure would be temporary and would reduce significantly in the years ahead and then dwindle to nothing.
An inflationcoin would have such a subsidy into perpetuity.

Well I'm not convinced such a scenario is all positives, but I can see a case for some positive effects:
1. Economic: 
If Bitcoin monetizes into a reserve currency, it would amount to a massive wealth redistribution.  This could actually be a net good for worldwide GDP by shifting large chunks of wealth away from the current 1% and into a new distribution of largely younger technophiles who has more net productive uses for that wealth.  One could think of an analogy with forestfires.
2. Political:
A shift to a neutral reserve currency could force the powerful major debtor nations to address their long term fiscal problems sooner and perhaps more soundly than they otherwise would.  More like Argentina, less like Greece or the Weimar Republic.

The correct way to think of dollars is also as % fraction of the total dollar supply.  As that supply increases at around 3-5% per year (roughly), dollar holdings in savings accounts with 1% nominal interest actually have -2 to -4% rate of return in the correct (relative units).
So in the long run that is the advantage of bitcoin - it can outcompete savings accounts. In the long run in a bitcoin/dollar mixed economy, prices of major purchases such as real estate should hold steady or slightly decline in bitcoin units.
So if it gets to major global currency status (with salaries in bitcoin, corporate bitcoin cash reserves, etc) it would combine the safety and convenience of cash with long term relative returns on par or superior to real estate.  So from an investor standpoint its grossly superior in the endgame.  No rational saver would choose fiat currency savings accounts over stable high powered money like bitcoin.  The big question is then will governments attempt to put an additional tax on bitcoin to make their fiat currencies competitive. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:41:46

False.  Already falsified by historical examples, and logically inconsistent with efficient markets anyway.  Capital will flow regardless due to investment arbitrage opportunities, has nothing to do with inflation/deflation.


Unless you have specialized unique knowledge about the future, you shouldn't be loaning money or investing (beyond holding some safe benchmark portfolio that just gives roughly world GDP growth - see my other recent replies).
If a business is undervalued, that is a speculative opportunity that some specialized investor/arbitrageur will take advantage of - typically by equity investment rather than business loans.
As markets get more efficient and increasingly AI driven going forward, investing in anything other than safe benchmark portfolios becomes increasingly random gambling.  Average people should not be expected or expecting to beat the market.  They will just get burned.

It's pretty clear, its declaring bitcoin *by law* to be a commodity, and *outlawing* use of bitcoin as a currency:
From Section 1 (applies to everyone)
"Bitcoin is not issued by a monetary authority, it does not have the status of legal tender and obliged acceptance status of currency, it is not currency in the true sense. Bitcoin is a specified virtual commodity, it does not have equal legal status with currency, and it **cannot and should not be circulated as currency on the market**."
Also this lovely gem:
"To prevent virtual goods like Bitcoin using the name of "virtual currency" to over-promote, **damaging the public interest and the RMB's position as legal tender**, the Notice requires financial organizations and payment organizations in their daily tasks to use the correct concept of currency"

Individual savers/speculators will always invest/save in the best performing asset: it's hard for a currency that exponentially inflates to compete in the long run.
It's in each player's best interests to control the money supply and if possible - force use of their own money on the other players.  It's collectively the least worse option for all players to settle on a neutral money supply.

Currency is a way to transfer value over space OR time.  We can consider its efficiency across space as a function of various exchange rates and their fluctuations, taxations, etc etc, whereas efficiency over time depends additionally on unpredictable future events and thus speculation.
Inflation is just temporal effeciency &lt; 1.0, deflation is just temporal effeciency &gt; 1.0.  The latter is necessarily associated with speculation/volatility/bubbles/hoarding/savings.  Long term deflation/temporal efficiency is eventually limited by demand constraints.
A currency experiencing hyperinflation has terrible temporal efficiency, but still can have spatial efficiency.
The long term appeal of BTC is potential for high spatial and temporal efficiency, both approaching 1.0.  Dollars/Euros have a spatial efficiency around ~0.90:0.95 (sales taxes, fees), and a temporal efficiency vaguely around 0.7:0.9 per year due to continuous money supply expansion.

That's extremely simple: because the merchant could save money by accepting payments in BTC (priced in dollars/euros/whatever) and then quickly transferring to dollars and thus avoiding credit card/bank fees.
This becomes viable only when the BTC-&gt;currency conversion is cheaper/faster/convenient, which is true now only for some limited markets, but could become much more true over time.  The main conversion cost for currencies is due to volatility, which should decrease with trading volume, exchange maturity, and BTC valueation.

There are already dozens of alt-crypto currencies, some of which are just blatant forks of BTC, but most of which have at least a few new potential improvements.
However, there are a few things BTC has going for it:
1. It's a flexible platform with a huge room for future feature improvements.  If another crypto-currency has a genuinely better idea, it can simply be rolled into the next BTC update.
2. BTC has the momentum and network effects on its side.  Holders of BTC and investors in BTC related companies have a huge leg up and strong incentives to make BTC better than any competition.

If bitcoin becomes a major world currency (which is a big *if*), then it will probably become *the* world reserve currency.
Viewed as an asset, a reserve currency like the dollar has a rate of return that is basically (GDP - inflation), and minimal volatility.
Bitcoin would be the same but without the inflation.  Global index funds can probably capture the GDP growth aspect but i'm not sure how the volatility compares - major currencies have immense liquidity.

Also, they have a whole section about how financial instuitions need to educate customers that bitcoin is a virtual commodity, not a virtual currency, and can not be used a currency - "protect RMB's official currency status."

It's hardly a design flaw - markets prefer inelastic currencies, given the choice, because they more predictably retain value over time (ie, gold).  Elastic currencies are a funding tool for states.
Prices in bitcoins could be stable only when/if the bitcoin economy is large enough to maintain a significant pool of agents that use it for all of their transactions.  Or they could stabilize when/if the long term outlook for Bitcoin becomes less speculative.
Essentially the market is speculating on whether or not Bitcoin will grow into something like gold or the dollar (or just become worthless), and that is just not something that can be decided overnight - volatility is thus given.

"On the other hand I do believe the change of replacement by another cryptocurrency is very high."
I thought this too at first, and then I actually investigated the Bitcoin design more.  It's a very flexible open platform with a huge open space of features in the future.  If some other currency has new ideas and starts to gain traction, it will be easy for BTC developers to implement those ideas.  There are already many alt-currency proposals and knockoffs either implemented or designed, some of which (such as litecoin) have a little traction already, but the early-adopter and network effects, combined with BTC's flexibility as a platform, make it unlikely to be usurped.

Tim - if a government came out with a crypto-fiat bitcoin knockoff that had a predictable 2% inflation, that could probably get some traction.
It still amounts to a 2% built in wealth tax though.
But the bigger problem is it would still be a single nation's currency.  It's time for a universal currency beyond the control of any one nation.  
Modern welfare states don't really *need* 2% seigniorage to fund productive social uses - they have plenty of other funding options already.

If enough agents believed that bitcoin was truly 'deflationary' in the sense that it would be worth 10x its current value in a year, then bitcoin would near instantly jump up nearly 10x in value.
Whether an agent has 100% or 1% of their savings portfolio allocated in bitcoin is irrelevant - they will save and spend, net increasing/decreasing across the entire portfolio.

BTC went up to $240 and then more people cashed out then in.  Where do you think that money went?  The fact is people did give it away for goods (or for dollars, which are easily interchangeable for goods).
The only way that BTC could rise in price against the dollar in a 'deflationary spiral' *indefinetly* is if BTC monetized and the dollar demonetizes.  This would only be bad for those late to convert from $ to BTC.

I said fractional reserve banking is possible, but strong insurance of the FDIC form which gives typical deposit dollars a counter-party risk near epsilon is not possible.  FDIC relies on the lender of last resort, which relies on said lender having infinitely deep pockets.  No such bitcoin lender can exist.
Imagine a bitcoin bank that gives 10% interest in bitcoins. Lets say in the initial year 20,000 bitcoins are deposited, and inflow/outflow is stable thereafter. After 100 years, there are &gt; 260 million bitcoin deposits in the bank, exceeding the total supply of bitcoins by a factor of 10.  Obviously such ridiculous leverage and low reserve ratio is unsustainable, and in reality such a bank would fail ending in a bankrun.
And in such a bitcoin bankrun, it is obviously technically impossible for all the depositors to be bailed out - is this not obvious?  There are physically not enough bitcoins available.
Strong deposit insurance like FDIC is only possible for a fiat currency which is backed up by the promise of inflation (in one form or another).
In a bitcoin economy, every bank that returns interest in bitcoins would eventually fail or stabilize at 0% appreciation/interest (in bitcoins).  Without exception.  *Every single one*. Its not a question of if, but simply of when.  People would generally understand this and realize that investment/lending is zero sum and risky.  
Thus in a bitcoin economy most money/value is held in raw bitcoins, or 100% reserve deposits, rather than super risky fractional reserve deposits.  Indeed, that is already how the ecosystem is today.  
And we already have one example of a fractional reserve bitcoin bank (bitcoin savings and trust), and it lasted less than a year and ended in tears.


Bitcoin replaces/out-competes the whole spectrum of fiat instruments. (maximum liquidity, zero counter-party risk, GDP-level rate of return)
 


It is known in the case of bitcoin.  Its also fairly straightforward to add up all savings/checkings deposit dollars (M2), although naturally these are slightly different entities.


Relative degrees of success: The bounded supply is what gives bitcoin the longterm edge (high rate of risk free return) against all inflationary currencies and many other assets to boot.  The 'hard money' fixed supply is what drives end target evaluations in the range $100,000 to $1,000,000 per BTC.  If its just another fiat inflationary currency but with a better digital payment system that doesn't support such high evaluations.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:25:14


That is only true if the wealthy people don't have some other way to 'hoard' (save) their wealth - which of course is far from true in the modern world.  Placing a savings tax (inflation) on one asset (dollar savings accounts) just encourages savers to put more of their savings into other assets (houses, gold ETF, etc) - causing bubbles.
The idea is flawed - it would take much much more to actually shift the wealthy over to spend more than they would naturally like.

Yes, and I thought it was a joke.  It's about as much of a science as political 'science', or psychology (which it necessarily overlaps with).
Lots of conjectures and simple equations, very little predictive power or hard evidence.


This directly contradicts efficient market hypothesizes.  Nothing the fed does can possibly ever make markets more intelligent or better allocate investment decisions.  It can only 'grow' the economy in terms of increases in arbitrary meaningless debt/inflation quantities.


Nothing wrong with debt, nothing wrong with savings.  Occam's razor and Bayesian Induction suggest that the prior for the optimal inflation/deflation rate is zero - and it would take a much better argument than 'economists self-selected by other economists say inflation is necessary for GDP growth' to overcome that prior.


Bound to happen if Bitcoin really gets big.  It's a better asset - why would savers knowingly choose to pay an extra tax if they don't have to?

GDP is something of a flawed concept, a form of semi-sophisticated economic propaganda.
There are only a handful of major stores of value: real estate, securities, currencies, commodities, gold, etc.  You can get a market cap of each of these stores in terms of the others.  Real estate (on earth at least) is more or less fixed in supply.  So is gold.  Energy is the major commodity, and it is also fixed in supply by physics (although those constraints are far more technology dependent, time varying, and complex).  
Securities are mainly shares in (ideas, inventions, services and people).  This (and currencies) is the only category where the supply is unconstrained and GDP growth/deflation really applies, and that is exactly what we see.  In 1940 a 'computer' was a service job: a human being you could hire to perform boring calculations for you at the rate of a few per minute.  
We've had massive GDP growth/deflation in this idea/technology/service sector over time and this is the main driving force improving the world.  Its only 'deflation' when the relative demand for that stuff increases faster than the supply of currency, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with that!  Deflation is not a dirty word.




In the modern world the main value of a currency is as a means of exchange across time.  BTC has some value as an international payment system, but that is largely independent of its value as a savings instrument.  Its value as a savings instrument is of course highly speculative and bubble prone - because it amounts to betting on whether or not BTC will monetize and replace the dollar&amp;euro.
If BTC does monetize and 'deflate' to $millions of dollars per BTC, that will *hardly* be an obstacle to it becoming widely used as a medium of immediate exchange.
Also, even if it doesn't monetize, it still could (and indeed already is) being used as a medium of exchange across space rather than time.  Again BTC's use as a fast international payment system is largely separate to its speculative/savings/investment value (spatial vs temporal).  And its the latter which is driving its current price volatility. (which again becomes a non-issue if it fully monetizes)

What?  You are thinking that BTC's price needs to be pegged to the dollar, which makes no sense.
The $/BTC ratio depends on the demand/supply of the two units.  The demand for $ is semi-stable, and the supply of both is predictable-stable.  The volatility (or lack of a stable 'price') is completely due to the unstable demand for BTC.  The demand for BTC is unstable because it depends on whether or not BTC will become a new world reserve currency.  
If BTC becomes a world reserve currency, it will roughly 'stabilize' at a rate of a million or so $/BTC.  Otherwise it will stabilize at some much much lower valuation (such as zero).  It has rapidly fluctuating value in the meantime as various speculators/investors attempt to predict the more likely scenario.
In other words, you can interpret the various $/BTC exchanges as collectively operating as a prediction market.  Last I checked they were predicting that BTC has something like a 0.01% chance of becoming the next world reserve currency.

Currencies compete.  The USG's ability to maintain its world dominance depends in part on its ability to issue many trillions of dollars of the world's most prized currency each year to fund its operations.  
If the world market completely loses its taste for dollars/treasuries, then the dollar would demonetize(hyperinflate), which is very similar to the stock price of USG-corp collapsing/bankruptcy.  
In such a scenario the USG still has plenty of assets (technology, land, employees, etc), but it would be a serious problem.
Actually I think the best long-term solution for the USG is to take control of BTC and adopt it as the national currency so it can be controlled.
