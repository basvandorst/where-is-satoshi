They're pretty big in the UK (you might not know their name - they own Play.com) and id love to see their implementation happen internationally :)

Done! nice sub too missed that one somehow

Possibly one of them. 
But I don't give a shit, I think Google CEO Eric Schmidt said it best speaking on Radio 4 a few years back...
"What we are doing is legal. If the British system changes the tax laws then we will comply. If the taxes go up we will pay more, if they go down we will pay less. That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom.”
They pay people shit tons of money to make sure they pay as little tax as legally possible. I'm not denying using offshore businesses and other similar practices go on but they're within the law..we should either fix the laws or continue to expect it. Why would they pay out millions when they don't technically have to?

Figured that might be the case! No worries

Eli5, sorry I shoulda said I'm not at all aware of the technicalities here, I just wondered how they compared considering bitcoin exchanges and their customers in general tend to be more tech savvy  
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:38:36
So people primarily invest BTC into altcoins? interesting business model/scam

The company is CeX (Computer EXchange) they're a UK based retailer. They have stores in most major cities in the UK and they all accept Bitcoin I'm pretty sure. You can do the same online, their website is  they exclusively deal with second hand stuff, they buy 100% of their stock from the public as far as I know. I'm pretty sure you can sell your stuff for Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2014-05-23 08:36:24
 not sure if it's on there but everyone should know this website exists :)
@_date: 2014-09-10 16:05:50
the comment above is deleted so I may be misunderstanding you here, but for the consumer debit card transactions are free 99% of the time in the UK. Unless you're purchasing from a small shop where still you're only charged if you don't spend much normally.
As for the cost for the vendor I couldn't tell you..

Are you saying dogecoin tricks users out of BTC? ELI5

For those wanting more details, he was a government advisor on drugs policy here in the UK. He was fired because of some of the results from his studies and statements made on the use of recreational drugs.
I feel regardless of your stance on drugs policy firing an advisor for doing his job is not cool. Since then his role has been replaced by far less scientific and more political figures. He started an organization that does independent drug research after seeing firsthand the problems that occur bring tied to a governing body. They need money to keep operating and accept bitcoin!
a few people expressed interest in donating BTC but the bitpay page didn't work, it is now updated with the address so send em away :) this is the kind of place I love seeing a BTC donate page at!
edit: he appeared in the old thread

In their Glasgow store they introduced the 4th Bitcoin ATM in the UK, but sadly this is only for the one store. There's more info about it all here 
@_date: 2014-09-04 15:20:52
Yeah to be fair, they weren't talking about bitcoin in general but more the role bitcoin has played on Darknet Markets..I agree the coverage coulda been nicer to BTC but it was fair given the context. Great show overall, love BBC Horizon

To give some context to the answer beneath, LoL is *huge* in terms of viewership. I don't play, I don't know a whole lot about the game, I don't care for it from what I've seen, but this is something I imagine a lot of people want.
 
This picture blew my mind, I had no idea eSports reached a level where these kinds of numbers attend events.

any idea how long online banks took? Does it even effect them?

honestly I've never been more ashamed of my government. They ask a scientist to do research and fire him because of the results. What the fuck is the point of pretending when you're being transparent cunts in the end anyway..blah it rustles my jimmies somethin' fierce 
@_date: 2014-01-04 11:58:04
How do you feel about this threads mixed reactions? People seem to love the fact a company of your size\reach\value has adopted bitcoins (myself included), but there's also a lot of hatred in this thread. Does it bother you to work for a company with such a negative image? I'm guessing you're a fan of btc if you're posting here, so in a way its your peers slating you.
@_date: 2015-01-16 10:47:40
Far more technically minded people than me have implied it's impossible for this to have happened. Take from that what you will.

I can't seem to find them for sale, but [this card]( was due out in July sometime so should be available

Micro SD cards are the craziest for this...there's a 512gb Micro SD now. They're 15mm x 11mm x 1mm and over 12,500 x the capacity of your old Mac Plus harddrive. If you stacked enough Micro SD cards to make it the size of a standard house brick (couldn't find the exact dimensions of a Macintosh Plus hd) it would hold more than 107500000x your old Macintosh Plus hd. Early morning math might be wrong but sounds about right...

I'll never understand how Ross Ulbritcht was sitting on $32,000,000 and at no point before that did he back out. As you mentioned $1,000,000 would probably be enough, but Jesus, it's hard to think $31,000,000 wasn't enough. Ego stretched the width of his customer base.
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:56:10
By that logic charging you 99.99999999999999999% would also not be steep...that being said I don't think 20% is particularly steep
@_date: 2015-03-27 14:23:01
It's a giga-bitcoin, or 1000 coins ^I ^actually ^have ^no ^idea
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:35:37
Whilst I completely agree with your general point... 


...isn't it the case that people have coins tied up? I understand it was their decision to trust BTC-e but it's not as simple as just leave if you have money there. Apologies if this is inaccurate but that's my understanding.
@_date: 2015-03-21 11:46:17
I agree man - I'm just saying that telling people to just leave the site when some people potentially have thousands tied up there is kinda harsh. I'm sure they will be leaving once their money is withdrawn but in the meantime they're going to want to stick around.
@_date: 2015-03-10 09:36:20




I'm guessing these two relate. I mean, how do you get your first few dozen customers? BTC is already shrouded in the midst of distrust due to Silk Road et al. so I think people are pretty dubious. Coupled with how much people preach the importance of good security I don't think many people are keen on letting someone attempt to break into their wallets, even if they can't access them themselves. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:28:45
So, this has had some interesting responses. Firstly as mentioned in the post I didn't write this so to all critiquing or complementing the writing, it's nothing to do with me.
Secondly, why's this sub so negative? I mean, this isn't supposed to be a *serious* post..it's just a funny read and I thought I'd share :)
@_date: 2013-06-09 13:20:52
This is going to be a bit of a ramble but I had some thoughts on this the other day.
Say you buy bitcoins - well the currency you originally used to make the purchase with is taxed already, so some tax is taken there.
But what if I mined? Then they're not taxed surely..well what if I say for example ran a software company. Say outside office hours we turned all our machines into low-power miners so the electricity bill wasn't too high, I'm sure this can be done. Then what if I paid my staff with these bitcoins (lets assume I mined enough to pay them) and they then purchased everything they needed with them. This is where I can't work out how *any* tax is paid.
All that being said I know nothing about how tax works just a thought I had.

Worst I remember is capped connections (you could download say 10gb per month)..must have sucked to pay per min. Also the cost of internet porn.
@_date: 2013-06-09 14:49:03


Ok so lets say your job was working for my tech start up. We pay all staff in Bitcoins which we mine ourselves. Are you still paying income tax?
@_date: 2013-06-23 10:15:18
Genuine question - what did you do whilst online? I love reading as much as the next person but I've got to imagine if it took images/videos/sounds days to load I've have probably given up by now
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:51:23
I'm just trying to get at the hypothetical point - if we all traded with each using bitcoins who pays tax? when do they pay it? and how does the government get a penny of it?
I'm just curious if there's a loophole here - what about keeping your wealth in bitcoins instead of money? Kind of like an off shore bank account..obviously the fluctuating price of bitcoins would be an issue
@_date: 2013-06-09 14:40:43
I'm sorry I don't understand your comment fully. The first point you make...you're using zero of your local currency here, that's why I devised this scenario.
As for your second point sure. You'd pay tax there but a seriously small amount. Also what if your electricity provider exclusively took bitcoins?
I assume this varies HUGELY based on the country you're in but I'm just curious as to what would happen if say everyone here in the UK turned away from £ and started using BTC. Since the government has no control over the money, how do they keep it taxed?
@_date: 2013-06-22 23:28:59
did anyone really ever have to pay per minute to use the internet?!
