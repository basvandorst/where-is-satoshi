On altcoin chains, particularly early in their inception, there is plenty of solo mining still going on.  The minutiae of these rules will have considerable implications beyond just bitcoin itself.

No, what you filed in February was for the 2013 tax year.  If you first touched bitcoins in February 2014, you'll first need to deal with this stuff on your **next** tax return, for the 2014 calendar year, due sometime in 2015.  
But start keeping good records now.

I agree with your overall sentiments and frustrations.
On  though, the basic strategy as a miner to protect against this risk is to immediately sell upon receipt the correct percentage of your newly-mined coins for your tax bracket to cover your tax burden for that year.  Essentially, like it nor not, Uncle Sam already "owns" that percentage of your mined coins.  If you don't sell them immediately at market price to cover the eventual tax bill, conceptually you are loaning an asset from the government and playing an investment game with that asset on margin, with the usual attendant risks.

Scams or not, admirable or not, there are many examples of profits made by early mining of coins that later became popular.  
Just by way of example, take Person A who pointed his server farm at Darkcoin (then called Xcoin) during its first week by solo mining on each machine, and Person B who pointed the same-sized farm at the first official pool during the same week.   Both persons raked in an equivalent sum of darkcoins that they could now sell for a tidy profit, as the coin has flourished.  
It will be bizarre if that income and profit qualifies for disparate tax treatment merely because of the method of mining.

Some altcoins, upon release to the public, take a while to reach their first exchange and have no market, yet can be mined.  Under these rules, when mining such coins before there is any exchange to which to peg their value, is the correct income (and cost basis) to report under these IRS rules $0?   
If so, if ever audited, how would one adequately document this "lack of value" at the time of mining? 
If sold later (after the coins reach an exchange) would the entirety of the altcoin's value then be considered capital gains?

Sorry, this doesn't work mathematically, for the reason stated by nmgafter.  As soon as the reactivated 99% blow through the next 2016 blocks, the difficulty would shoot back up.  The net result would be that miners, as a whole, would have mined less coins than if they had just consistently mined the entire time.

The basic coin, without DarkSend, is open source.  The additional DarkSend module is currently closed source and is currently only usable by downloading a binary version of the coin client.
This means you can presently send and receive darkcoins in the normal, non-mixed manner using the open-source code.  It also means that allegations that the devs could somehow "inflate" the total number of coins through the closed source portion of the code are misplaced, as the open-source portion of the code that governs the basic coin emission formula is there for everyone to see.

Any new laptop will be more than capable of handling offline Armory.  I have used 15 year old laptops that originally came loaded with Windows 95 and they can handle this task just fine.

Impressive list of charities.

I like the way you think.  (Not the outcome of course!  Just your stark analysis.)
Even without that kind of malicious ill-will, I suspect 2014 is going to be a tax shitstorm in Bitcoinland for a lot of folks.  Can't even imagine what it would look like if the IRS made Bitcoin public enemy no. 1.

Yes.  Yes it does.

There's some complexity to that, apparently, as discussed in this [video]( re: taxation from the Bitcoin 2013 conference.

Thanks for all your work on this audenx.
I never requested ACH verification from Bitfloor, either before or after Bitfloor shut down, but am owed some USD (about $100).  There are probably more like me -- ICU has to figure out how to deal with this scenario too.

This stat can be a little misleading: miners actually have an incentive NOT to include too many transactions in their blocks because it increases their orphan rate relative to other miners, which causes a net loss to their proceeds.  See the discussion [in this bitcointalk thread]( for example.
Merely raising the cap by itself, without paying higher transaction fees, does not solve this game theory problem.

A fledgling Bitcoin "securities" market has arisen on various exchanges like [Havelock]( (and the now defunct [btct.co]( and [Bitfunder]( in which bitcoin holders can purchase and sell Bitcoin-denominated instruments that fluctuate in value, many of which also pay periodic dividends in Bitcoin.
Let's ignore for the moment the obvious questions of whether issuing such instruments is even legal under U.S. securities laws.   Assume someone owning bitcoins (acquired through mining or purchase) has traded in such instruments.   How would the purchase, sale, and receipt of dividends of such "Bitcoin securities" be treated for tax purposes?

I had this problem two or three days ago.  Up until that point I had always used using Google Voice as the phone number for receiving the SMS.  I went through the process available on the website of changing my phone number to my actual cell phone number, which took about 12 hours in my case (although they warn it can take 36 hours).  Once it was completed I was able to receive SMSs at the new number.

Interesting.  I've got a Capital One 360 checking account that I set up specifically for bitcoin-related transactions.  So far I've used it for about two dozen Coinbase purchases, no sales, none of them particularly large though.  Had also used the account to fund bitfloor twice back before it folded.

Could you expand on this a tiny bit?  What kinds of "plays" might we expect to see in a bitcoin market because regulators either cannot or will not touch it, that would be too risky because of legal sanction in a fiat market?   This "wild west" nature of the unregulated bitcoin market is something I've been trying to get my head around as a newcomer to the bitcoin scene.   I have a background in law, but not in finance.  Anything would help -- point me something to read, or give me a few concepts and let me unleash my google-fu.

The real value of tax legal advice can come in how to structure your business, how to prepare your returns, and how to navigate the complex process of negotiating with the IRS if you do get audited. 
I suspect a tax lawyer worth their salt is probably going to advise against pre-preparing a document.  That's not really how interactions with the IRS work -- having a pre-prepared opinion letter isn't going to ward off attention if the IRS takes an interest, and it just reduces flexibility in your negotiating position if they do.
