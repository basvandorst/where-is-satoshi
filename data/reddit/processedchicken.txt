Anyone else craving ice cream now?
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:58:54
They developed the urge to hodl all the things.
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:08:00
This is the sort of thing that reminds me that I'm just plain dumb.
@_date: 2018-08-25 06:54:53
Now your next goal is 10 BTC
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:02:08
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:19:53
It's likely there are 180 people stealing this right now.
@_date: 2019-11-09 16:19:02
Good job, only 20.9 to go!
@_date: 2019-03-16 14:23:28
Can't even trust them with a title let alone money.
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:01:55
Plus, these days when coins are on the ground it's because they are glued there for the entertainment of watching people trying to pick them up.
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:00:46
GRAFO plots never lie.
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:11:59
That sounds kinda bad.
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:47:19
Darn, your fast reactions got you to this entirely believable situation before I could.
Have you considered becoming the new CEO of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:44:49
They have a plan for riches with no flaws.

Did he bbq meat on his miner?
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:46:02
You need something to shake at the kids when they mess with your bins.
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:44:02
This is completely legit as nobody with bad motives would go to the effort of helping people like this.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:36:11
I didn't spend more money than I can afford to lose on bitcoin.
If it goes into a bottomless pit I'll be sad but it's not going to cripple me.
I do anticipate it'll at least bounce back and I eventually won't at least lose anything.
When eventually is and what the bounce will be, just have to wait and see.
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:28:02
*Checks date*
Well, ok.
@_date: 2019-09-16 08:18:05
\* Looks at printer. Looks at roll of stickers \*
Wonder why I've not heard of someone doing this before.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:08:58
Is a sequence of multiple Barts known as "Doing the Bartman" ?
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:31:40
Possibly the CEO of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:30:22
And risk someone stealing your broom?
@_date: 2018-12-06 08:53:04
@_date: 2018-12-06 07:37:49
HODL for 30 years then buy a sandwich?
@_date: 2019-05-05 11:37:37
Someone used a quantum miner in 2027 without reading the instructions.
@_date: 2018-12-06 11:41:07
Haha, will do.
It'll be one hell of a sandwich!
@_date: 2018-12-10 13:37:28


Lunar conspiracy confirmed.
@_date: 2019-05-28 11:41:33
I really can't imagine myself ever spending more than £20K on a car, even if I had Lambo money.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:51:53
Hahaha, actual lols at that.
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:45:03
You appear to be living the dream.
Quite which dream, I have no idea.
@_date: 2018-12-06 07:38:42
Hoping for my free sandwich in 30 years.
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:19:52
I'd give you some of my Christmas dinner if I could. :)
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:38:51
Grab a blanket just in case.
