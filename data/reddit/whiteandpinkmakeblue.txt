Yes it did? at the end of the series Walter ends up with everything he wants in the beginning of the series. Sure his family might hate him. But he never set out to leave a loving memory or anything of the like he set out to leave them money and to provide for his children which he more than does. Also he doesn't ever have to serve jail time or anything. Walt essentially completely gets away with everything in the show  and he wins.

Is this a ledger nano s? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:37:50
I too watched this video. Just wanted to add if your using ledger or trezor he doesn't mention it but you should memorize those 24 recovery words as well as write them down. in worst case of like a fire or whatever.

Gemini seems like a good place for that or use multiple exchanges all at once

There a term that investors in the stock market toss around and it applies to like everyone here Its called FOMO. fear of missing out. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:22:53

I don't understand your comment could you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:26:21
Yea I am just kind of hesitant cause some I heard some dude deleted a shit load of it accidentally and while bitcoin has had similar issues I don't like fully grasp how it works and such.

!remindme 1 year
put in 1500 recently after every time I seem to check in on I kick myself for not doing it the previous time I checked. At this point I am gonna start putting in any extra money I have to try an get as much as I can. I just don't know whether to put some in ethereum at the lower price or keep putting into bitcoin. either way I think I am going to get a trezor pretty soon.

I wish my credit card would work on coinbase so that I could have bought more at 9 and 11
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:17:45
The money I put up for bitcoin was money I was saving to put into pennystocks and investing in general and yea I'm pretty tempted to sell at the moment. Though the overwhelming amount of positive outlook I see for when etfs come through make me want to hodl as long as possible however if I see it dropping I think it's an easy answer to sell and rebuy at a lower amount.

Amazon has them and Walmart even sells a similar device

Atm just planning on trading. Btc is going sideways now so I'll prob go in on litecoin for its halving value
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:24:25
Op as someone who just quit his job and bough some  and some  of 2017 best advice would be just to try to average down. My average is somewhere near 6k now cause I just bought more when it was cheaper like now. Thought I don't think this run or bull trap or whatever is over yet so good luck to ya man
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:15:07
I'm still pretty confident there is still a possibility for gains there. Like there is still more then enough time I'm not planning on holding lite coin I'm planning on gett in on the run up.

Some people cant work like yea it's virtually nothing but if this a younger kid or whatever in a couple years he may get a windfall of like couple hundred bucks.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago so today you can look at your beautiful tree. The second best time is right now so you don't kick yourself in 20 years for not planting the tree.

Can you link to the source so its easy to see what he said cause I don't understand this at all.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:35:28
is the source btw.
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:04:17
That literally means nothing. Just cause one analyst says he believes it to be possible doesn't mean it will happen. There are so many different people looking at so many different patterns its not even viable. I am of the opinion that its gonna do what its gonna do no matter how many fancy algorithms and formulas you want to use. The simple truth is the market does what the market wants to do. The only chart I actually give any kind of credence to is the halvening one just cause I believe past performance is indicative of future returns.

Teslas are notorious for being atrocious with maintenence and the service stations are far and few inbetween causing them to be unreliable.
