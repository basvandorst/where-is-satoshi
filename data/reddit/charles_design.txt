Sounds like a good one, can you share?

Can this be seen via an explorer? If so, can you link it?

An open source payment processor does seem like the optimal solution. In the meantime I don't see the added value offered over current solutions (eg: accounting, fraud, returns...) sufficient to incentivise change.

Well I shall agree to be "fooled" by the banksters until the optimal solution wins. Though I foresee a more likely scenario where they both work side-by-side with BTC (or another Blockchain) providing more clarity and accountability to these banksters.

Scenario 1 is pretty much correct, just spread across some time. Also, it won't be my daily card - more of a backup.
You're missing the point, you need to understand that change is a gradual thing and not a binary thing from Fiat to BTC over a single day. Cultural adoption/acceptance is a long process, even more so when it involves money which is the most heavily regulated industry. Only if we accepts these small steps can we one day imagine a world where BTC is directly accepted everywhere.

I'm not saying it's the optimal solution but it's hard to argue that it's not a positive step towards mass adoption. Majority of retailers accept Visa, that's just a reality. 
But if we are to state the issues, I'd primarily go for the fact CB holds my private keys.
@_date: 2019-05-08 20:37:55
If I understand correctly you're suggesting that all retailers should accept BTC directly? With no payment processor?
BTW, privacy isn't my main motive (I live in the UK) as per my title transparency and inclusion is.

Spending crypto in physical retail

That's pretty much why I got it, but I'm hoping to see some utility to emerge from ERC tokens (or other).
No yearly or inactive fees, main one being the crypto liquidation fee at 2.49% per transaction.

It's a tall ask for small nontechnical retailers who need an intermediary to setup WiFi. I'm a proponent for a more gradual approach, which currently entails CB as an intermediary. As time progresses I have no doubt it'll be replaced by more efficient providers.
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:36:33
I'm well aware of this, and I agree on the fact that it's far from the perfect solution but rather one of the few ( neither of which move actual BTC).
From a user standpoint thought, if you have crypto you want to spend at a physical location the value prop becomes compelling. Besides that, it definitely accelerates awareness, with the recent explosive growth of Monzo (20,000 weekly sign-ups at one point) in the UK it's hard to deny the cultural need for new banking services. As you'd expect the demographic is within the 16-35.

UK only as I understand, unfortunately I won't be incentivised to use since there's a 2.49% fee.

*awaiting better solution*
@_date: 2019-05-08 20:28:41
I don't get your point, are you really expecting retailers to switch direct from fiat to BTC?! I think we can both agree on the need for a middle payment processor.
