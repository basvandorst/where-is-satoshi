I think a better solution would be to have mining specific cards that outperform in hash performance but under-perform on games. Not sure what that would look like, but what they've done with the whole "no video in/out" compute cards is a good start. Have it be nerfed to hell in some way that will prevent it from being a good gaming card. This would make miners buy those cards instead of real graphics cards. So, if you wanna mine with your gpu you bought for games you can, but there's zero reason to buy one over a more efficient compute card.

Do you guys really not understand how the remindme bot works? lol. Just click the link.

I understand the sentiment, but I think this is irresponsible at best. Unless you have the attitude of "It either goes to xxxx or zero - I don't care which, I'm holding."
I am sure without a doubt that cryptocurrency is the future. 
I am NOT sure without a doubt that BITCOIN is the future. 
Downvote me all you want. I understand that bitcoin has been excellent for a lot of people (myself included) for a very long time. It's paved the way towards mass adoption and has put the world on notice. However, 
 think that the mindset around this sub of "IF IT'S NOT BITCOIN IT'S A SHITCOIN HAR HAR HAR" is immature/innacurate/unsafe/unhelpful. There are some VERY compelling projects out there with some very real, distinct advantages over bitcoin and it's becoming more and more true - not less. It's ok to be passionate about bitcoin. It's ok to feel a certain loyalty to a coin that has done well for you. It's not however prudent advice to take an asset that is seeing serious decline week over week and to declare "don't care, head in sand for 5 years."
My .02 sats. I own bitcoin but I also own some other coins for projects I believe will do very, very well!

Oh my god the fucking fud. What is wrong with you people? Dude wears a shirt because he's happy and passionate about bitcoin and you rattle off some bullshit about $30 fees? LOL damn do something better with your time. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:00:28
This has to be sarcastic. Bragging about $11 fees? 
It's also just after a dip so the transaction volume is much lower than it was say 4 days ago.

They're partners with XLM and they're trying to launch a giant exchange to make XLM the pair instead of BTC just fyi.

Also those miners don't buy games. They don't help games sales so developers don't pay nvidia/amd for their endorsements etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:08:15
Lol ok please tell us why that'd be better.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:00:46
This is stupid. You mine alts on pools that convert to BTC for you. So no, you're mining bitcoin directly, but you're mining for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:18:46
You understand that without those people though bitcoins value would most likely be back down in the triple digits right? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:34:03
If that's your biggest concern with bitcoin then you should be very, very concerned at the parts you're overlooking. 
10 years from now gigabit internet will be mainstream, 32 tb drives will be less than $100
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:32:45
The market determines value. If you want mass adoption and to be able to use it as currency you would want more people in it, not less. This would naturally make it less volitile. Why did Bitcoin drop 88% 2 or so years ago but this year it was less than half that much of a drop?

@_date: 2018-01-07 04:33:50
Then where do you get $30 fees? And how do you know if he said or didn't say anything about the current state of fees? It just seemed like a very downer statement. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:50:00
Lol. Where's your crystal ball?

Shhh you're not supposed to talk about that here. Only about LN and how everything is fine

It being brought up only to be immediately dismissed by "but lightning is coming!" EVERY single time isn't a discussion. Other subs DISCUSS it (as in meaningfully talking about it back and forth) because they're not brainless "BITCOIN IS THE ONLY GOOD COIN ALL OTHER COINS ARE SHITCOINS" zombies
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:09:12
Maybe people give to charity and don't post about it? Why assume the worst? Terrible way to live. 
And, even if he didn't buy "anything useful" with HIS money....why do you care? This guy was prudent and invested in bitcoin and made money. Now he's using (some of?) that to buy something he really, really wanted. That's the dream for him. Yours is different. Do with your money what you want. Others will do with theirs what they want. Don't judge others based on your own personal views. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:47:35
Lol ok bud
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:56:24
So by cashing some amount (he/she never said all) of this person's Bitcoin to buy something they want but can't buy via Bitcoin at the moment and denying a bank thousands (possibly 10k) on interest by buying with cash that's a douchebag "slave mentality"?
Wow. That's pretty silly. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:57:57
Don't hodl your breath
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:12
Lol every time you prove you weren't lying in this thread I get hyped that naysayers and jealous morons like this get BTFO. Grats, man
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:56
We can celebrate with a fellow bitcoin person. If you don't like it downvote and move on. Why try to make a stink about it? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:58:08
Glad you've had a better experience!
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:28:22
Setup a coinbase/gdax account. Transfer your coins to your wallet on there, attach your bank account and cash out on that. Their BTC&gt;$USD happens pretty fast actually. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:52:47
Congrats! Best of luck!

Also to think that they're keeping that much fiat in other exchanges where it could potentially be hacked, mt gox'd etc is just dumb. Why open themselves up to that risk when they don't need to? They charge a fee, plus they charge a little bit above market to make sure they have some wiggle room and that's that. It's not some super dark, super secret, "out to rob you" type thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:38:00
Posts like this are so stupid. Language like "rob you" is retarded. I know they pulled a stunt with the whole bcash thing, but this post is like a 13 year old wrote it and is trying to impress you with his "deep" knowledge. 
No one forces you to use coinbase. There are other exchanges. If you don't shop around for the best price then you're just a moron. That simple. Other services are far worse. They're not a charity and they're in it to make money. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:23:44
So many immature/counter productive comments in this thread.
"You should have hodl'd forever" "You should have gone with such and such different car" "lol you'll be wanting to kill yourself in 5 years when it could have been a Bugatti" 
Stop for a second and think. This guy had a goal. He hit his goal and he made it happen. Despite people on the internet always thinking they know everything about everything and everyone: you don't know how much he still has, you don't know how much he's given to others or how charitable he is - you don't know ANYTHING about him. You also don't KNOW that bitcoin will keep rising because you can't see into the future. Period. There's a scenario where bitcoin drops wayyyyyyyy below where it is now and takes years to bounce back - or never does. No matter how much you want to believe that it couldn't happen, if you don't actually believe it to be a possibility then you're fooling yourself. So hold off on your criticisms and snark on a post where someone is happy and trying to celebrate with us all.
r/bitcoin and Bitcoin in general should be about celebrating wins together. Understand that people have different "wins". Some want bitcoin to pay off student loans. Some want it to pay of their house. Some want it to buy a car they wouldn't/couldn't buy. Some want to just see how high it can go while they hodl. Everyone has different goals for this adventure, and as a community we shouldn't be trying to criticize each-others goals. We should be celebrating them together. You won't always agree with what others are doing - whether they're hodl'ing on for dear life or they plan to cash out at a certain point and buy things that don't interest you. They get to make their decisions and you get to make yours. Be OK with that and don't feel the need to interject with your .02 sat every time.

Yes transferring back to coinbase or gdax takes time. Sometimes it's fairly quick sometimes it's not.  Enable 2 factor and don't sweat keeping small amounts on there. My 2sats
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:10:05
That's where you're wrong. Very few people on this sub seem to respect the fact that A LOT of the money in Bitcoin right now helping the price rise to where it is is money from investors who want to see their investment grow. They know some version of block chain will prevail and will be the answer long term, but love it or hate it: most the money in Bitcoin now is not people loyal to a specific version of the technology, and they couldn't give a shit what "brand" you call it or who thinks it's "real" or not. And when they see utility dropping off a cliff and it costing them an ever increasing amount of money to send and transact, they'll go somewhere else in a heartbeat. Acting like $30+ fees is ok and normal is just sticking your fingers in your ears. 
You can shout "hodl" and talk about why Bitcoin is the true Bitcoin, and how bitcoincash is an abomination... But at the end of the day would you rather have all the investors move on and have your "true version" of Bitcoin go back to $300 a coin? Or would you rather be intellectually honest that in it's 
current form (core), the utility of Bitcoin has gone way down, and seek to address and keep investors through improving it/seeing more utility? LN has been "close" for a long time....LONG time...people are already moving on. Even if lightning were implemented tomorrow, there are still a lot of very valid critiques to it to the point where it's possible it may not even work well or be a good answer. 
I'm not saying bcash is a better coin or technology or even the "true" implementation of Bitcoin...what I'm saying is unless you REALLY don't care about the price and are content just being smug and being "right", it does matter to a lot of other people and don't be surprised if the price of Bitcoin continues to drop as Bitcoin cash continues to rise.
