Yes but i see it positive - I mean it was a 3x. There are people who lost more than 90% of the investment.
It was just unpredictable. Halving sounded so promising but afterwards nothing happened and i sold in profit.

I cashed out around 500 USD and invested 100 USD in 20 Litecoins and 8 Ethereum ������
Side note: I had no fucking clue what this actually was until 2017. I was just curious about price development. Then I received ETC (from the fork) and I had no idea why. Made a lot of profit again and invested everything in ETC. After a few weeks I cashed out again and invested at the beginning of 2017 about 1k$ in 4 Shitcoins (I went to coinmarketcap and I made my investment decisions on 4 coins with interesting logos + similar max coin supply of bitcoin) They did well again until beginning of 2018. Consider that the best decision would have been to stick with BTC but yeah I had no idea what i am doing. If there is another bull run there will be newbs (like I was) again.

Coinbase will always know that you owned Bitcoins because you are verified. You can try to send your BTC to Wasabi or a BTC Mixer and afterwards to the Trezor. You can pretend that you have been scammed if you get in trouble.

True. Seems like the 2 years contract with BCash (fork in August 2017) / Roger Ver ended &amp; renegotiations failed. Don't trust an account who is willing to shill any shitcoin for money.

Why is Roger still talking shit about BTC on Twitter then?
@_date: 2019-08-25 19:52:57
I guess he participated in a pool which means the profit is quiet fixed. You have an average income - not that random to be honest.

True. Unfortunately this subreddit is more interested in discussing about shitty price predictions.
@_date: 2019-10-04 06:05:58
Hey Joseph,
Thanks for clarifying. What's the reason for a 0.0005 BTC Withdrawal Fee then? Sure, you want to have a part of the cake but this is among all the big exchanges (I use) the highest fee - sometimes even 10x more.
When big exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase &amp; Binance wait for other exchanges we'll never improve the Bitcoin economy. One has to make the first move - Gemini solved it too, without waiting for other exchanges.
@_date: 2019-10-19 19:58:13
Do they still publish ishues?

Bitpanda Global Exchange is at the moment the cheapest. 0.10% maker and taker fee.

I have seen it in Amsterdam too and it was closed in April. There is an Bitcoin ATM in it, you can buy books about Bitcoin and they have different events &amp; courses with guest speakers etc.
They also show Mining Rigs but they don't mine and you can't buy them ��

No, not that impressive but you can buy Bitcoin anonymously (but high fees)

That's a side street of the Kärntner Straße. Rent isn't that expensive and there is still a high number of visitors. Although I highly doubt that it's profitable. Maybe the Cash ATM charges a high fee.

In 2 days, 2 years ago we had 20k. Feel free to create a post in 2 days.
Great comparison:
On 15th December 2018 we thought BTC is going to zero.
On 17th December 2017 we thought BTC is going to 1 million.
@_date: 2019-12-15 13:28:13
So why do we celebrate birthdays then when I can say in mid of February: "Hey guys come over and let's celebrate my birthday because I was born today 19 years &amp; 132 days ago." Or why do we have a Bitcoin Pizza day? Why do we say every year on the same day: Today xy years ago the genesis block was mined.
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:52:49
That's not a random timeframe that's 1 year ago (365 days ago). Do you remember the market sentiment 1 year ago? People were shitting their pants because we dropped that low. A lot of people capitulated. Now we are up more than 115%
btw: calm ur tits
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:53:49


By that logic a pump from 3k to 14k is a bear market.
@_date: 2019-12-08 17:05:10
You forgot the nice Altcoin logo.
@_date: 2019-12-15 13:33:39
My point was to remember the 15th of December 2018. A lot of people capitulated and the sentiment was like we are going to zero.

It makes the network more secure. The higher the Hash-Rate the more (powerful) miners there are. Miners secure the network.
It needs 51% of the Hash-Rate to attack the network. It's getting more and more expensive.
