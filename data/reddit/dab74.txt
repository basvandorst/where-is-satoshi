We should go ask those people on Bitstamp that keep selling while Coinbase and Bitfinex are buying.

Predicting his maneuvers can be next to impossible. As a rule of thumb I'd keep an eye open for rips twice the height of dips, i.e. today's dip is  so I'd be very careful in the 18K area, if and when we'll reach it.

@_date: 2018-03-30 10:40:55
Still keeping an eye open on 1D RSI and Stoch RSI. I'll wait for the daily candle to close [it's 13 hours from now] and see if it will close either above MA300 [~$7300] or below the mid-term trend line [~$6650], then it's either half in or all out. If we keep moving between this range I'll have to wait more before making a decision.

There. Scared huh? That will teach you.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:23:15
Big dip + price now somewhat stable = lot of buy orders when Asia wakes up in a few hours. Hopefully.
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:55:26
That would be a $136 profit minus the fees. Have a look at GDAX, no fees there if you use Limit orders. Other exchanges have variable fees.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:44:26
There are ways to make an educated guess though. According to TA guidelines the trend had a 7/10 chance to break down the wedge because of *a* and *b* not reaching the upper border. I haven't paid enough attention, a beginner's mistake.
On a general basis I don't trust this stuff blindly, expecially when it comes to cryptos, but you have to rely on *something* and this is all we have. It isn't much but it's better than flipping a coin.

@_date: 2018-03-08 18:58:01
So what? Why can't you just wait a week or two for the price to go up? You still have the same amount of BTC as before in your wallet and no one can take them away from you. You don't take a loss until you sell at a loss.

On the long run it may prove to be a decent entry point, even if we go down to 4k along the road. I didn't intend mine to be an intraday investment.
Meanwhile, [2nd attack to the resistance line failed]( I wouldn't be too surprised [and not even worried] by a ~$300 retracement in the next few hours.
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:12:32
All alts down and BTC either stable or slowly going up. You know what this means, yes? People are trading alts for BTC. This is no new money incoming. I'm not sure this will benefit BTC on the long run.

@_date: 2018-03-22 23:20:02
Not until the current hourly candle completely closes itself over the ema200 line if you ask me. We'll knew in 40 minutes. At any rate we are still between the borders of the [uptrend channel]( which is something.
Source: my ass, as usual.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:44:44
We got out of the 3-days downtrend channel [red] and the road to 9k is paved but I'm not going to claim victory until we break through the monthly downtrend line [orange], which would require 9.5k by monday.

You have to put it in perspective, those amounts in a short timeframe are not common on Bittrex. Arbitrage does the rest. And btw, Bitfinex isn't the [leading exchange]( anymore.

@_date: 2018-03-31 21:23:54
It's very simple, actually. People / traders / bots / whatever were buying a lot when they saw the price was going up, therefore pushing the price further up. They are now selling a lot because the price is going down, therefore pushing the price further down. Whales *alone* can't crash the market or make it skyrocket. They manipulate it by either pumping or dumping the price, but in the end all they have to do is making the first move, then the market itself does the rest. As if today was a good or bad day for Bitcoin, there's no telling yet. Daily candle closes in two hours and a half. So far it has been an average day.

We're now moving within the borders of a triangle formed by two major trendlines. Bounced on 4H MACD trendline, which is good, and 1D RSI is rising without having hit the oversold area first, which is so-so. I got half-in  hoping we could break the upper border soon. If we don't, I won't sell and I'll be ready to buy more at whatever level this thing wants to go.

Heh, I've learned the hard way too. Simplicity is what brings most people to Coinbase, and it's also what tricks you into thinking you can make easy money. It's the other way around, totally. Too bad GDAX doesn't have an app on its own and the site is awkward on phone, but you can somewhat get used to it. On computer it's great. Seems intimidating at first but you'll get used to it in no time. See [here]( for a simple tutorial and also have a look at the other videos of this guy.

Not sure what people are so afraid of. This is just mtgox inertia effect, pure and simple. It will fade off over time and in a matter of days or weeks we will be back in business and you'll laugh at yourself for being so emotional now.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:02:41
My view.. TA works because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. If every trader and every bot were to follow the same TA rules you could potentially identify supports and resistances almost always because it's where everyone would place buy and sell orders, respectively. It can't always work because obviously not everyone follows TA and whoever does, does not follow the same rules. But when it works, it's not by sheer chance. And when it does not, you either got it wrong or it's not valid anymore and you have to start from scratch. Plus, whales. When they get in action you might as well throw TA out of the window.

It all depends on how much fud the media will draw from it. The DC isn't a reliable indicator, it just displays what has already happened. Still, the uninformed part of the market is pretty big and may be easily scared by it.
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:32:29

I don't think it's negativity. It's this mindset that tells that if it drops down hard it will abruptly bounce back up and skyrocket. It *may* happen in a bullish market but in a bearish market I'd say that if it really drops down hard, chances are it will drop down even harder.

That's what would happen if prices aren't already going down on the other exchanges as well. If they are, even minor exchanges can push the price further down regardless of their average volume. I won't insist though as I don't have screenshots to back up my point.

All moving averages show that market sentiment is still in *strong sell* mode on a daily basis. I don't want to influence anyone but in my opinion if you get in now you're taking an unneccessary risk. Which may pay, sure, but on the long run if a trend reversal is imminent [in term of days] there's not much difference between buying now or at 8k.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:06:29

The daily candle shows this has been a completely useless day for holders and a decent day for traders. Moderate volatility but we haven't moved an inch, a mere Open/Close $10 difference. The good news is we're once again out of the downtrend channel [red], but we still have to break the negative trendline [orange] which slapped us so hard on March 5. I don't really trust trendlines myself but that's where media would tell everyone that Bitcoin is alive and kicking, therefore mitigating the recent FUD and possibly attracting new investors.

I'd say it would be more like 8200-ish. I hope my lucky coin is right though.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:54:39
It's only $200 more and it feels like it's 20,000.

It was all good until someone dropped hundreds and hundreds of btc on Bittrex. Thanks for ruining the weekend, asshole.

I don't think we will go that low but this time around we need stronger buying pressure than before to get back in business.

I'm pretty confident Microsoft wouldn't ever register such a lame domain name for their exchange. They would probably come up with something fancier.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:08:24
As a rule of thumb I wouldn't ever trust TAs that span several weeks. You're either extremely lucky or extremely knowledgeable if you get it right for the next two days to come.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:54:16
Exactly. That being said, some kind of software that collects orders from the major exchanges would be certainly useful. I'll let you know if I find anything.
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:51:58
I usually monitor Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Bitmex. Bitstamp because is where I draw lines out of habit, Bitfinex and Bitmex because they lead.
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:41:57
It's the two Moving Averages on short and long term trends about to form the infamous [Death Cross]( which according to TA implies a market crash. If we skip the cross we may be safe for the time being and possibly enter an uptrend. If not we crash hard in a matter of days. I wouldn't be too concerned by this stuff though, in my opinion it's garbage for the most part.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:33:20

Europe, your move. 10K today plz, kthxby.
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:38:49
It appears the last spike was due to a total of 50 BTC buy orders on Bitstamp @ around 12:06 UTC. Other exchanges didn't seem to react though.

Heh. I'm not even sure Nobuaki Kobayashi is his real name.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:56:24
I think I'll take his word for it.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:37:47
It's the [MACD]( indicator on the 4H timeframe. See how the bottoms match with a bounce of the indicator on the trend line? If it bounces again there's a high chance to go up. If not.. well..

Take another nap so it goes up to 11K.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:08:32
I believe bleeding has stopped. Took the chance to buy more at $9.8K. \*crosses fingers\*
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:16:32
Actually that would be quite simple, they could prevent them by not allowing big orders to be removed until a timer lapses, so that other traders have enough time to interact with those orders and make those people think twice before they place them again.
So why the exchanges don't implement such a simple solution? Because they don't care one iota.
Or perhaps because those orders are placed by the exchanges themselves?
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:47:51
I don't even know why they bother anymore, it looks like spammers get obliterated in no time around here.
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:30:50
No, I'm looking at the daily chart and I see that we've just survived a 1.2K drop with only a few scratches.
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:44:22
4H Stoch RSI unloading its overbought load. I wouldn't call it a dump *yet*. If it is we'll know it shortly.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:16:23
Not sure where you guys get your TAs from but 
[this]( is clearly an RTR [retarded T-Rex] pattern.
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:30:07
IF the trend continues it's 9400 today and 10100 by friday.
edit: daily trend invalidated at dump o' clock.

I guess I'll scrap the dice and flip a coin from now on.

[The little tiny hook of hope]( :)
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:37:45
Dammit, sorry, I rushed through your question. You indeed need a VPN to access Bitmex from the US and you'll also have to send your earned btc to another exchange [Coinbase] to cash it out. I'm not sure if you risk an account ban though.. as a non-US resident I didn't have to go through the process.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:33:03
As a rule of thumb DO NOT use Coinbase to try to buy dips and sell rips, unless there's at least a $1000 difference between the two. You'll never win otherwise. Sell and buy prices never get updated to the market price during dips and rips, you always end up selling lower and buying higher than what the chart says. Also, during either dips or rips most of the times the order doesn't get filled at the desired price and you have to try again, always losing money in the process. Use Limit orders on GDAX instead.

@_date: 2018-03-02 23:22:19

I also urge you to downvote me to hell if it turns out I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:18:38
Charts are telling me we're going up in the next 24 hours.
[Bounced off 4H MACD trendline](
[Oversold 1D Stoch RSI is rising](
[Mid-term trendline broken with decent volumes](
[Bounced off 1D Bollinger Bands](
[Last two daily candles almost in Bullish Engulfing pattern](
[We're very close to EMA200](
Also, my guts. No, it's only my guts. Ignore the crap above.

Aaand we just broke through it. On February 6 we broke it by 60$ and bounced back up. Now it's by 40$ so far. Let's see what happens.

@_date: 2018-03-15 13:33:09
I'm glad there are other fellow analysts in here.
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:27:08
I'd keep an eye open for a potential dump around 4:30 am UTC on 2018-03-10, it's 5 hours from now.
The story so far:
* 2018-03-07 4:30 pm UTC: dump
* 2018-03-08 4:30 pm UTC: dump
* 2018-03-09 4:30 am UTC: dump
* 2018-03-09 4:30 pm UTC: dump
Of course this 12/24 hours pattern could be over, who knows.
Whoever is doing this.. would you kindly STAHP?
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:50:16
Nah, I'd say it's around 66% if you're extremely competent. So it's more like 30 for me.

Not true, most analysts agree with each other. Go to tradingview and look at the BTCUSD buy/sell indicators. At the time of this writing it's 16 buy vs. 1 sell on the short term.

So.. according to 1D Stoch RSI oversold, a beautiful bounce on *both* 4H MACD and 1D BB, we'll go up within a few days.
I don't think this is very reliable in a manipulated market but hey, one can hope.
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:15:14
I miss that 12345abcdwhatever guy and his utterly wrong predictions. Yesterday he mistook a 300$ pump and dump for a rally to 9k [followed by a crash to 4k, of course]. What will he have in store for us today?

Oh hey it's new to me, never heard about it in months, why no one else ever mentioned it?
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:26:36
10 hours with price somewhat stable around the 9.9K area, I'd say panic sells are over. Also, 4H RSI is oversold and 1D RSI is unloading the overbought. Doesn't seem a good time to sell to me, unless we drop down 9.5K.
Of course the above will mean shit if whales are around -.-
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:52:52
I should have napped harder. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:38:22
Well I got in  so you do the math. Not that I care though.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:29:54
I knew it. Happy Lambos.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:07:16
I don't think you realized that *I* am the one manipulating the price here.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:46:07
Oh? That's why I'm broke. I knew it!
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:55:48
Pretty much at every Bitcoin "death".
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:24:40
By comparing USD/BTC and EUR/BTC charts it appears the sudden drop has been caused by the €8K sell orders, BTC was at $9,9K when it happened. There are less €8K sell orders now though, so it looks like there are higher chances than before to get past the $10K barrier.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:23:11
Looks like 10K are here to stay for a while. Hours? 4H Stoch RSI isn't in overbought territory yet. I may be horribly wrong ofc.
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:11:03
Both 200 SMA and 200 EMA are being tested. The next few hours are critical for the short term trend. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:27:48
Ah, misread that bit about your bank. Odd. As the word says, SEPA transfers are supposed to be allowed within the entire € area.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:03:27
We have nothing to be worried about, I just rolled the dice and it turns out 9k is today's bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:18:14
This comment makes more sense than many others in here.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:18:09
Erm, yeah, I was quoting King Leonidas in "300".
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:13:10
Yes, it is. [This]( is the linear scale and [this]( is the logarithmic scale.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:00:35
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:26:08
I'm actually quite enjoying the battle between bulls and bears.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:42:08
Huh, was about to post a quite long explanation but others have already answered better than I could. I'll just add, just think of liquidation as a Stop Loss order working in favor of the exchange when you borrow from it the money to do a leveraged trade.
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:24:04
BTC: - hold my beer
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:02:52
You're a fucking genius!
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:03:57
This should be useful 
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:25:46
OMG WAKE UP THERE'S A HUGE PUMP GOING ON RIGHT NOW
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:30:11
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:14:48
So if it was a hack to the exchange itself why bother going through the alts/VIA sell/buy process instead of siphoning money directly from the storage?
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:05:13
Aaand we're going up.
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:39:50
Yup, up to $1000 withdrawals, anything above that and a 2% fee is charged. Not sure if that's what you're looking for.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:05:30
They're actually covered by FDIC up to $250k.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:02:04
When you feel bad always remember that this guy \*proudly points thumbs at himself\* bought at 11500. Then at 9800. Then at 8000.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:43:20
Whales show no mercy and take no prisoners.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:28:44
For the next few hours I can picture two possible scenarios, both completely pulled out of my ass:
- we quickly get back to test 11K and slowly rise again
- we slowly go up and beat the crap out of 11.8K
Bets are open.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:37:12
Bitcoin crash will not. Slowly rise it will.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:47:29
If you say so. So far I haven't found convincing evidence of anything from either side. Also not sure what's with people downvoting, I'm not advocating either one.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:32:40
And it has been broken just now. Do whales read this sub?
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:50:44
Actually it's interesting from a day trading standpoint but I'm not concerned one bit.
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:58:00
There are no such things as supports or resistances in a manipulated market. Period.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:27:01
It was a wall and you surely can explain why we bumped on that thing twice in the last days without breaking it. And I'm not a kid anymore since the 70s.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:03:09
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:52:00
Tell us where the current dip is. I'm waiting.
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:19:45
It is, good catch. I'm glad there are competent technical analysts in here.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:04:52
This quietness is very suspicious.
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:38:36
Relax.. couldn't miss the opportunity to make a joke.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:27:30
Why should I tell you, huh? How do I know I can trust you? Actually, I'm pretty sure *you are one of them*.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:11:57
Oh. I thought it was an upside down Moebius ring pattern. Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:35:20
Here's my ~~educated guess~~ view I just pulled out of my ass.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:24:11
Holding since 9.8K. My view: if 8K-ish holds we bounce back up hard. If it does not, we go down even harder. Whatever the case that's what I'm basing my buy/sell strategy on.
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:19:59
Morning guys. Looks like someone had a lot of fun selling last night. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:13:45
By comparing it to the volume displayed by the exchange you point to? Actually I've never noticed if it is any different.
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:04:25
Simplest solution: add a "report for FUD" option.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:02:08
Hahaha silly human you don't know what I'm capable of.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:02:54
THIS IS WHERE WE FIGHT
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:38:23
So on Friday 23 it's either Hel or Valhalla. Cool.
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:48:04
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:44:28
Whatever the case it seems like someone doesn't want us to get past 9.8 for the time being, it's been 5 times in a row now.
EDIT: scratch that, 10k!
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:09:31
Me, I'm not a shorter anymore. It's just too stressful. Tried margin trade, didn't like it, gave up. Not my cup of tea.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:29:23
That 4H red candle is scary.
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:06:58
I am. Oh, this morning you forgot to put out the trash and feed the cat. You are / I am a horrible person.
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:17:15
lol, 4 hours to go up from A to B, 5 minutes to get back down to A. Oh BTC, you so funny.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:07:52
And here we are, 1D Stoch RSI is now entering the oversold area. Here's the plan: I'll be half in *tomorrow*, if this 7500-ish is the bottom, good, I'll use the other half to buy more when the trend is *clearly* reversed. If this is not the bottom, whatever, I'll use the other half to buy the "true" dip, provided I'll be able to catch it. Don't take any of this as advice, in the end it's all about gambling.
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:28:56
That's where the fun lies.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:38:36
Oops, typo, I meant 2015. Dates added. So now it's not a typo anymore :P
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:47:56
No. Volumes are low because of market indecision. Everyone is waiting for something to happen one way or the other.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:58:07
Is GDAX price chart acting funny on the 1H and 30 min timeframes for you guys as well? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:41:40
We first need a full 1H candle above [ema200](
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:03:25
Nice 1H green candle you have there, Mr. BTC. Now make another.
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:44:20
Pretty sure most hodlers check the price once a day though.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:44:25
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:07:29
That was a very good read, thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:27:36
Sick tired of this coin not going anywhere. Hold my beer, I'm going to buy $10 worth of BTC to spice things up. See what happens.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:43:51
And your source is..?
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:52:37
Damn. Apparently naps don't work anymore, got to try something new.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:53:21
Sorry, couldn't know.
First thing first I'll get you out of your wheelchair. Then I'll run over you with my Lambo.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:43:24
And this is why, according to the daily trend line: 
Then again, when it comes to cryptos it could mean shit.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:50:06
It is
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:01:46
This doesn't look like a common pump-dump to me, volumes are still steady. Unless the pump isn't over yet.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:42:53
I want to see that €8500 wall on GDAX get eaten alive.
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:02:20
Got past both MAs. Now it's vital to stay above 8550 for at least 3 hours.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:48:42
Haven't had the chance to see it myself but apparently a few hours ago some guy repeatedly placed 250 BTC sell orders whenever BTC was near $9.8K.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:18:36
What also makes it both exciting and scary is that any piece of advice is either right or horribly wrong, lol.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:22:13
I've been watching the damn thing fall down to its knees all day long without doing anything at all, while in my imagination I sold at 9.8k and bought at 8.8k, so I'm making an imaginary profit. Enough trading for today.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:18:11
Hell no. Go on, sell. That's the only way the price can go up.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:52:07
His ban? Did he get banned?
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:51:58
Such a drop is very unlikely, there's a strong support wall at 8k and the weekly trend shows we're slowly recovering from the last 7k drop.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:39:49
Someone is trolling us always at the same hour since three days now.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:08:34
No, the indicator should collide with the trend line within a full day.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:05:00
Nobody knows for sure but according to the short-term trend this is the bottom. In the end, it's your call.
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:58:18
Oh cool, this is today's bottom, I'm buying. Ah wait, it's going down. Damn it's going up, I have to buy *fast*! Umm no no stop that, it's going down. Aaand it's going up SHIT NO IT'S DOWN AGAIN I'm not buying. Been at this three hours now.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:58:57
Oh. Was the bet still valid today?
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:48:30
I'm not gonna make it.. tell my wife that my wallet address is.. is.. \*dies\*
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:13:38
Bitcoin, I give you less than one hour to get back into the uptrend channel I just pulled out of my ass. Then I'll unleash all the power of the €0,30 I have left in my bitstamp balance.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:18:15
Jesus F Christ. One hour to get from A to B, two minutes to get back to A.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:11:56
So will I, apparently. Shit, too early.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:37:59
So much hope in that thread.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:18:58
Well, this is interesting. Have a look at the market [momentum]( which is one of the few indicators I tend to trust. See anything unusual? The sell momentum after the price increase has lost strength. Meaning that people / bots / whatever have been selling *less* than before even though the price has been basically the same between the two momentum periods. In short, it looks like buyers have surprisingly regained some trust in the market in the last hour. So there's a high chance $8000 is actually today's bottom. We'll see.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:47:12
It is, that's why it's fun.
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:48:50
Every person in Europe and America would have $100 less in their bank account.

Thing is, they can't do it alone. Whales only give the starting signal, then the market follows the lead.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:02:05
I don't doubt your skills as a wizard but I hope you're wrong. Bitcoin is full of surprises :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:37:14
Yup, same as mine. But I usually source data from either Bitmex or Bitstamp so wasn't sure where yours passed through.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:04:36
Oh wow. Blindspot works. Have to watch more.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:04:20
I like big green dildos.
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:37:42
Volumes going down since the last hour, we'll have to wait a while to hit 11K again. I'd keep an eye open for *both* $11K and €9K barriers, personally I'm not going to sell until both are broken.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:29:43
The enemy uses scare tactics. We need to stay strong. Now where did I put those dragon eggs?
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:11:56
Apparently BTC got fond of the 11K area.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:03:48
Steady, guys. Just a few whales passing by and making profit.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:36:11

A potential sign of trend reversal on a (somewhat) monthly basis.
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:11:51
Pfft, $15 is insulting for a whale. Let me try with 17.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:34:24
Everyone: Yeeeh BTC is going up
BTC: hey guys check this out
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:45:50
To piss off technical analysts.
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:11:45
Sorry. Next time I'll ask for faith stuff.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:02:51
How about a nice cup of shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:55:24
Because that is the middle term trend line. You're referring to the long term trend line.

Stay the hell away from it unless you know someone reliable in some Telegram group that can tell you when the next pump/dump is. You can easily either make a fortune or lose everything in a few hours.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:04:52
Did I just watch a total of 130 BTC buy orders eating through the 9k wall in a split second?
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:35:30
Apparently you fail to understand that each exchange has its own market and volumes are proportional to their size. 130 BTC eaten in a split second isn't common on GDAX and yes, that was a wall. lol. kids.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:49:28
Europe, you had one job.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:34:23
Do you realize that your predictive chart isn't anywhere similar to the current one? Just sayin'.

Entirely possible.

If I were you I'd avoid Ponzi schemes like the plague. Also it's CPU only so unless a lot of people fall in the Ponzi trap you'll spend in electricity way more than what you may gain by mining.

These are the historical bottoms on daily candle's close from 2014 and the daily RSI values in the oversold area. Data sourced from Bitstamp.
    Date       | Price   | RSI
    2014-04-10 | 363.12  | 24.1736
    2014-10-05 | 323.52  | 23.1424
    2015-01-14 | 171.41  | 19.4094
    2015-04-14 | 215.80  | 27.4178
    2015-08-18 | 224.80  | 21.6615
    2015-08-24 | 209.72  | 22.5647
    2016-01-15 | 360.00  | 25.9494
    2016-08-02 | 540.03  | 22.1657
    2017-07-16 | 1917.63 | 28.3001
    2017-09-14 | 3227.79 | 28.4811
    2018-02-05 | 6874.27 | 26.3397
    2018-03-30 | 6850.00 | 30.1721
Bears may have still something to say. We'll see. Daily candle closes in 7 hours.
edit: daily candle closed, table updated with the new data. Note how RSI did not close in the oversold area [conventionally it must be &lt; 30], so 6850 does not qualify as a historical "close" bottom.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:27:26
lol no. Damn, it didn't work. I will try Blindspot instead.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:19:34
Stupid 10.5K step, Y U NO get out of the way 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:24:20
No. We'll jump directly at 12K.

It's called stop loss strategy. Been holding since december and went anywhere, time for me to pay attention to the trends and start day trading.

No. Sorry.
They all come in green now.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:57:28
I know. Look what happened within two months when we hit it in 2015:
However, this time around is different. There's much FUD around this death cross in particular and I think that many people fearing a market crash will sell a lot if/when we hit it. I'm not afraid by the death cross but by the reaction to it.
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:15:39
My SL at $9500 is still there. Once it gets picked up, I'm officially done as a hodler. It just isn't worth the effort.
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:04:04
Oh good. We've just closed a pretty nice green candle on the 4H chart.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:49:36

Morning guys. We just broke the €8K wall. Once we get past $10K I'd say we can breathe a sigh of relief.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:58:34
Yeah, it's bad. You guys should stop checking prices for 6 months.
Erm, perhaps we should do the same.
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:58:52
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:52:42
Yeah. Here are the bottoms and the peaks on GDAX, Bitstamp and Bitfinex:
- 5920 11300
- 5873 11775
- 6000 11250
We should have foreseen this -.-
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:35:54
Wouldn't it be possible it was an aggregated order though?
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:50:38
Any Borg around here willing to explain to that wall at $8700 that resistance is futile?
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:45:18
Fine with me, I'll check prices every 0.0001 weeks.
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:03:38
Yeah. I'm almost lead to believe that they spread this shit on purpose. Oh, what am I thinking. They would never do such a thing.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:49:19

Wait. You were supposed to troll for a 6K dip, not 7K. Stay in character!
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:35:47
Perhaps there is a way when pumps and dumps occur but I have yet to test it extensively enough to tell if it's mere coincidence or what. Switch to the 1m chart, draw a horizontal line at the bottom of the candle *before* the "pump" candle and extend it indefinitely. The next time the candle touches the line, it may be the bottom. Why? Possible explanation: because pump and dump groups buy at *that* one candle before starting the pump, sell at whatever rip they see fit and buy again at that same initial level, therefore rising the price again. Again, not sure if it's mere coincidence but I've seen it happen several times before. See 
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:32:44

@_date: 2018-02-24 14:15:19
Well. Still here.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:51:35
To me it looks like it's always a good sign when cryptos react to dumps with *slow* growth in the hours following the dump. I think that as a rule of thumb we shouldn't even fear dumps at all, after all it's just profit taking. Probably what we should be *very* afraid of is the *slow and steady* decrease in price day by day because it would potentially mean a clear sign of market distrust. Thoughts?
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:58:31
May I ask why?
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:23:13
Nothing special, it was just another resistance to break. We did, and guess what, nothing peculiar happened. We're back where we were 12 hours ago. It's all about the psychological effect of breaking wall prices and hoping for a trend reversal.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:23:58
I'm looking at the monthly charts. Only time will tell if I'm wrong but I'll say it again: we're recovering. No amount of bad news has been able to bring this thing down to its knees.

Ok. [This is insane]( Try it for yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:40:51
I see. This is going to be a rough night. Asia will wake up in a few hours and I believe people won't miss the chance to sell a lot for profit. I'm curious to see if the price will fall below 9k once again.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:07:45
Still here? You've already been proved wrong what, twice?
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:53:00
See what?
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:53:26
I smell something fishy.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:51:21
No. The line essentially connects the two december 17 and january 6 peaks and goes on from there. We bounced back on february 20 and we did it again today. As time passes, the so called "resistance" gets lower and lower and you have to tell where the next one will be *without altering the line on the chart*, you'll just have to extend it. If and when the line is broken, the trend is supposed to reverse. Not saying it's exact science and I for one am skeptical that this stuff is anywhere near reliable, but this is how it's supposed to work. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:07:57
TO THE WALL!
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:06:18
There's still one psychological barrier to break, and it's the €10K. I'm keeping a close eye on it. Once it's down I believe FOMO will kick in *very* hard.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:56:32
Charts look kinda exciting now.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:21:24
Got out @ 10,170 with 1% profit and I don't feel like getting back in without some proof of strength and stability. Volume is too low for my taste. I'll either get in somewhere around 9,8K if things go downhill or when 10K is more stable.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:45:44
Good thing we have smart guys to remind us it can go down, then. What would we do without you?
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:12:27
This looks just too good to be true, so take it with a grain of salt. 1D Bollinger Bands show that volatility has never been this low since mid november, suggesting that the price will change direction one way or the other within days. 1D Market Momentum suggests the direction is up and 1D Stoch RSI suggests it's a matter of a day or two. Fingers crossed, everyone.

My view.. this is interesting but you might want to change your business plan and add the option to get the tool for free but with restricted features, i.e. 1 prediction a week for the free version. Make the full version a $49.99 premium version with no predictions limit. It would probably attract more users.

So is it going up or down? Answer: yes.
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:08:32
I don't think it's one guy. More likely it's more than one, or bots across several exchanges, panic selling does the rest. Or mere coincidence, who knows.

Thank you very much stupid whale, I took the chance to buy more.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:56:24
And it will drop down to $200.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:21:30
So far it appears 7.5k is the bottom. I'll see tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:53:56
Switch to BTC/EUR and you'll know why it dropped a bit.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:13:17

Thank you for contacting our Customer Support Team. One of our BTC representatives will contact you as soon as possible to tell you that you must HODL.
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:39:07
It does. But when volatility is this low it takes very little effort to make the price explode one way or the other. Whoever takes the first step within a couple of days will easily establish the weekly trend.

@_date: 2018-03-29 23:05:27
It is. I haven't got in yet because I'm still keeping an eye open on 1D RSI / Stoch RSI.
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:49:55
I'd expect a last ride to the 7900/7800 level though, as 1D Stoch RSI shows that we aren't in the oversold area yet.

@_date: 2018-02-27 20:29:00
Well.. since it's supposed to illustrate a monthly trend based on 1D candles, of course the two first peaks are in the past. And I have no idea if anyone knows. I'm pretty confident not even whales know, they can manipulate prices to a great extent but I'm not sure they could tell where price will be next week. Heck, perhaps not even this time tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:41:02

@_date: 2018-02-28 13:19:10
To speak out in favour of those who firmly believe in this ~~nonsense~~ "educated guess" method of analysis, breaking resistance lines doesn't *always* imply a trend reversal, it's more like a high probability.
@_date: 2018-03-25 11:22:25
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:17:30
I was actually paying attention to the open/close daily price more than anything else, which showed only a little progress.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:45:38
It's when we hit a bottom, rebound, hit bottom once again at the same level of the first bottom and rebound again.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:38:17
That doesn't imply a hack to the exchange itself.

[Y'all know what to do.](
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:21:55
I don't think so. Past years we had -20% and look where we are now, no reason to worry for -10%.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:39:50
Any amount is good. It's not a matter of how much but of how much gain in percentage terms, minus the fees. You'll want to start small anyway, expecially if you don't have much to invest.
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:05:18
Bleh. We haven't made any progress.
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:03:18

@_date: 2018-02-26 16:06:05
Seven 1H green candles in a row, 1H Stoch RSI overbought, 4H Stoch RSI now overbought as well. I can picture two possible outcomes: we either go up slowly or drop down *hard*. Bets are open.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:30:47

Apparently market prices are bound to bounce back from the band limits.

They just woke up in Asia and they aren't selling. It's a very good sign if you ask me.

@_date: 2018-02-21 14:43:15
I wouldn't sell yet if I were you. Wait an hour and see if it drops below $9500, which is where it would break the medium-term trend line. Conversely, if it rises back past $10800 we should be fine.
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:01:56

@_date: 2018-02-14 18:44:42
Too early to tell if we're out of the crisis. I'm waiting until tomorrow to see if it stays above 9k. Then I'll buy either way.

@_date: 2018-02-13 15:41:42
Damn, this is so pessimistic. Buy/sell walls can keep prices above/below a certain threshold, we've all seen them in action. They can't [and shouldn't] last forever but they're where prices most likely will bump in the opposite direction, whatever the reason for a possible break.

Uhh.. chosen on the basis that they are two consecutive peaks above all others in between. The line itself is not "after the fact", the last "fact" is the 2nd peak. You just keep going on from there and see if anything down the line [no pun intended] breaks the downward trend. Hey don't look at me, I don't make the rules :P
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:19:14
Just curious, what % of your gains are we talking about here?
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:58:28
Boy, that fucker is huge.
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:04:10
Monthly bottom is 8k, because I say so.
And yes, that's one hell of a TA, I may teach you guys a thing or two in the spare time.
edit: ok, doesn't hurt to share a secret I guess. It's an ancient technique developed in medieval China: you pull a market price out of your ass and tell everyone that's the bottom. If you're right your karma skyrockets. If you're wrong you blame whales.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:44:52
We're tricking the whales into thinking we want BTC to drop, so they do the opposite and pump it up instead.

I'm not familiar with copay so I can't really tell what's your best course of action, sorry.

Not sure what kind of stuff you need to buy that you can't buy with GBP and I'm not sure I want to know either..
Anyway try Bitstamp. It doesn't require much in the way of IDs [your identity card is fine], you'll just need an electricity bill as a proof of residence, and fees are cheap.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:15:26
You've had your fun, BTC. Now go back up. Pretty please?
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:03:14
First target almost hit, missed by 15$.
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:55:15
How convenient you always show up during drops.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:29:09
I think I do.

Bears are losing strength. Two consecutive failed attacks at 8k, the second weaker than the first: 
They can't sell forever now, can they? :P This is where bulls are supposed to take the chance to strike.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:45:27
When people stop trading them for BTC *and* BTC goes up.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:32:33
It better be because that's where I bought more.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:52:36
Nope. The idea is that breaking that line would mean a trend reversal, and everytime we hit it without breaking it we bounce back hard. I don't think anyone really knows anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:05:36
I understand Italian perfectly and he doesn't mention GDAX anywhere. The guy seems to have at disposal his own platform which sources data from several different exchanges, it wasn't a sell wall on an exchange alone but several sell orders spread across multiple exchanges. He didn't mention which ones either.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:25:48
That would also work.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:23:06
I was born relaxed.

Nope. Once again [postponed for a few days](
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:14:50
No. If it goes up, cool. If it drops to 1$, meh. I didn't invest what I couldn't lose.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:10:26
Huh what sources? Just open any chart on tradingview.

Are you for real? [*I am the one mocking TA here*]( read my other posts in this very same thread for god's sake. I do believe TA is mostly bullshit but I also try to keep an open mind and every one and then check if it's right. Look at the hourly candle @ 10 pm UTC, that's a dip whether you like it or not. Was the TA right? I don't know. Was it coincidence? I don't know. And apparently there's no way to discuss this in a civil manner when people like you are around. I also have no idea why you're flaming me, perhaps you're trying to look badass or something. What I do know is that I'm not going to waste any more time with you. /ignores

To close 10K buy orders. I'll get back in anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:13:48
Dude, you had your answer, it's either going up or down. It's not that hard.

Oh. So you're the one pushing alts down and BTC up. Good work!
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:58:50
Damn it BTC, do something, don't just stand there.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:14:23
You shouldn't feel bad as there are many people in your same shoes.
And you shouldn't feel desperate either, as we're recovering from the crash. A 4K recovery in ten days despite one bad news after another is insane, can you imagine where we would be right now without all the FUD? Things are bound to get better, just have patience.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:19:58
Wait. Actually he doesn't mention a sell wall at 9.8k. He doesn't mention a sell wall *at all*, this is click baiting at its finest, he added several sell orders from multiple sources and he just concluded that across several exchanges and in a timeframe of 2 or 3 hours 5000 BTC have been sold, and called that a sell wall. It wasn't. Well thank you cpt. Obvious, everyone and their mother already knew that today *a lot* of BTC have been sold.
tl;dr: the guy is full of shit
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:42:19
Oh cool, $1300 more and I'm back in the green.

Did the same. It won't. It's already going slooowly back up. As usual this baby needs some time to recover from the wounds.
EDIT oh it looks like it wants to see what's at  once again. Get back here you fool, there's nothing there, only monsters!

lol. I'm not even angry, this is amazing.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:40:59
This isn't what media says though and I'm afraid it will have at least some impact on the market. What media says is "Bitcoin is spreading child pornografy" and no one actually explains how hard it is to extract that data.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:58:06
there goes my charts analysis lol

Yeah right, small investors that can place 275BTC buy orders and then cancel them out. Sure.

I just talked to the scientists, they want your brain back to continue the research.

True in forex, a completely different matter in cryptos in my experience.
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:58:43
I'd rather have it on the site, with the added ability to share it on social media with a simple click on a Facebook / Twitter button.

They're busy registering new accounts to tell us how happy they are that BTC is going up.

A bit of both indeed. It's two systems feeding each other.

Looks very accurate to me.

@_date: 2018-02-15 20:55:06
*EMA. Wasn't Jan 11 though?
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:33:04
I'm not *that* confident, but the signs that everything is ready for a bull run are there. Yet, all Medium Average indicators show that market sentiment on a daily basis points to either hold or sell. It seems that everyone is cautiously looking for signs and no one takes the first step.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:46:26
That 11.5K wall must suffer more than Jarl Borg did.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:47:10
On a general basis, TA importance with cryptos tends to zero in my book. It *may* somewhat prove to be useful when whales are not around, but thing is.. they're *always* around. However, the death cross is a true danger. Many big traders and many bots trust these signals and I'm pretty certain they will sell a lot if the cross completes its shape. In the event the market will crash it won't happen because of the death cross but because of the reaction to it.
\*edit\* also, this: the last death cross was on september 14, 2015 and look where BTC was two months after that

"I got in at 139k and I'm hodling", Jeff said.
@_date: 2018-03-25 11:47:03
Days, I don't know. But I'm afraid it ruined our chance to get back safely to 9k by monday, which was pretty important.
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:08:58
Oddly enough, no wall  but there's one at 11511 with 100BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:13:58
I hear you, but reversible transactions would basically destroy crypto as a whole I'm afraid. Aren't irreversible transactions there to protect users from double spending frauds?
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:09:04
Sounds like a good plan.

Most of all, how did you lose all that weight? It's for research purposes.

Im fucking drubnk what happend
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:41:57
I have still some blood in my alcohol stream, so bear with me. I didn't see [this]( happening in real time 'cause I was busy with bbq ribs but now that I see what happened it looks like all those predictions about 3.5-4k within the end of the month may be utterly wrong by a long shot. We know it's a manipulated market and we got used to pumps but that one looks quite odd to me. And not because of how much it pumped the price, which is pretty normal by btc standards. It's not a matter of how much but *where*. It happened after the long term trendline was confirmed broken [two hourly candles below the line] and it got us back into the "safe" zone. To me it doesn't look like it was an ordinary pump. It was a rescue.
/back to bbq
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:46:04
Sorry but I don't post predictions, as I absolutely don't want to influence people in any way. I post charts every one and then and make observations and that's just about it.
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:56:05
Keep an eye open on 1D RSI, it seems we're heading to new daily lows. Also 4H MACD which is once again changing direction.

I'm confused. According to those fucktards who predicted the end of the world within the end of the month shouldn't we at 4k by now?
