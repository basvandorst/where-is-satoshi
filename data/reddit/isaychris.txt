alright, went abit of researching and ended up with this:
 
Every currency has two things in common:  1 - Something of real value (like gold or silver) to stand behind the coins and notes, 2 - A centralized government to control it. For decades, many internet insiders have worked to establish a digital currency of its own, but the problematic question has always been twofold: What will back the currency? Who will control the system? Bitcoin is the first currency of its kind to show true potential to become much more than just an internet sensation.  
Since Bitcoin was first created in 2009, it has seen unprecedented levels of growth and has a developed an ecosystem of miners, merchants, users and investors. Bitcoins are highly sought after by those looking to lower transaction costs, preserve anonymity and transact globally on the net. Some also consider bit coins as the new gold standard and a safe haven to keep money safe from taxes and capital controls. As Bitcoin buzz continues to grow, tech and finance journalists, political pundits and economists have been increasingly weighing in on Bitcoin. So what exactly is Bitcoin?  
•	Decentralized currency, not operated by the government or by one organization, but by a network of peers around the world.  
•	Completely digital and therefore global.  
•	Highly secure and virtually impossible to compromise.  
•	Send and receive via the internet  
•	Transfer directly between two parties without the need of a bank or middleman.  
•	No transaction fees or limitations.  
•	Transactions are completely anonymous and untraceable.  
•	While being anonymous, every transaction is made public in a public ledger.  
•	Supply is predetermined, with bit coins generated through a process called "mining".  
•	Bit coins are kept in a digital wallet online or paper offline.  
•	Never will there be over 21 million bit coins in circulation.  
•	Like stock, many exchanges exist to exchange btc for other currencies.  
Acceptance of bitcoin is still largely restricted on the consumer level to internet and bitcoin-related merchants. However, more and more "real-world" merchants are beginning to accept bitcoin as standard currency.

@_date: 2013-12-01 18:49:03
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:13:46

@_date: 2013-11-29 02:26:18
they jealous.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:16:00
cool. well i have like .12 bitcoins and im trying to exchange for 4 litecoins. i went on the btc-e with no account and when use the calculator thing it says:
Amount LTC:  4	
Price per LTC: 0.03204	 BTC  
Total:	0.12672 BTC  
Fee:	0.008 LTC  
The transaction amount exceeds the balance by 0.12672 BTC  
what does it mean by "The transaction amount exceeds the balance by 0.12672 BTC"? is it saying this becasue i dont have any funds in btc-e ?
