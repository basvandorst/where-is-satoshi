what do I tell them and what evidence do I need to provide? As they might think I'm just some person looking to get free coins

Is that meant to be a joke?

You mean this?

is it half a penny though? I don't understand that because there are no pennies in bitcoin are there? just whole coins and less than a whole coin. how many digits to the right of the decimal can we go?

Is that the part you mean though? the long bit in recipient?

Thanks it worked! so relieved now :)
A different question but when I bought bitcoins the calculator told me I would be getting  	0.031606 but I actually got 0.0316. was I short changed?

Does this re-scan? 
I bought something yesterday with the bitcoin using bitpay where i copied the address and pasted it into my wallet to send the company a payment but when I clicked send I got a message "the error was low spendable bitcoin detected" but the bitcoin had still been deducted so I contact support and sent them the second screen shot (where it shows recipient) and then they sent me the service I purchased. Load my wallet up today and find 0 coins with that unconfirmed transaction. Is the address I pasted above 2 addresses? as When I copied it from bitpay I only remember seeing 1 so not sure where the other came from
