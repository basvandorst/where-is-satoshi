And here I am waiting for the dip. :( I’m so hungry.

If you have an state ID from ND, sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:22:13
Beautiful 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:33
I keep watching it go down and up and down and up. I can’t tell when to buy! Do I wait for 1,300....
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:21:10
If you’re from Minnesota, you can’t use GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:16:23
But why?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:01:35
I was a bit shocked too. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:08:12
If it dip, I buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:54:20
I hesitated when it dipped to 13,500 to buy. I admit, I am still expecting to dip more in the next 48 hours. What’s that based on? Nothing, just like everything else. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:43:33
Pretty much, we can buy the dips and hope for profits. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:08:03
Hold until your investment meets your goal.  New shoes? Sell. New car? Sell. New home? Sell. New company? Sell. New island? Sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:09:47
It dipped and I bought. Now back to the moon! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:14:20
I don’t know. I’ve watched it dip to 13,500 to 14,000 and back down for the past hour. Overall it’s still trending down. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:26:38
Hmm. I haven’t look into that yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:15:40
[Really ](
Hawaii and Wyoming is also on that list. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:10:04
Hahaha. 
I love this. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:33:01
If it stops below 6,000 I am buying much of it. Not telling you how much because of rule 3. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:00:06
For those who spoke about this during Thanksgiving dinner, thank you. 
Now if I had only dropped a lot more USD into this beforehand. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:21:36
If it dip. I buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:23:55
You can’t define a serious benchmark and tell everyone else not to post unless it meets your defined benchmark.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:59:33
Dank pun. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:35:42
If it dip. I buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:51:32
I honestly wouldn’t be shocked if I woke up tomorrow morning to see it at 10k and one reddit user eating his words*
*genital. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:58:15
Dip some more! 6,000 here we come! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:41:52
With all the recent news on how freeze social media has been used to exploit people, people are still trusting these platforms?  I wouldn’t even trust accounts on Reddit. Go slap your friend. Now. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:59:21
8,000, here we come!
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:54:23
I just bought $100 more! I hope this upcoming fork doesn’t screw me over!
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:44:57
It went down to 5,500 last night when I was asleep. I need a feature that makes my phone into an alarm system when these extreme drops happen. My Coinbase alert wasn’t enough! 
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:44:34
I will buy again when it hits $5,000.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:44:18
That reminds me, I need to verify my gdax account. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:42:05
I bought a little at 6,100. I cried a little that I was asleep when it dipped to 5,500. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:23:52
$38 
 
It was my first purchase to see how things work. I plan on buying more  
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:25:58
Which is why you buy every time the prices dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:57:33
I made $3 in 12 Days! I should have bought more! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:55:54
I keep buying and hodl’n 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:05:04
 I didn’t articulate well. What I meant is to put 1-2% of the roughly 15% of my income into bitcoin instead of 401k/savings account. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:46:49
Ah eff, I forgot a zero! All I need to do is buy $2000 and I’ll pay off my home and then some. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:53:02
Some trading for sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:29:33
I’m looking to do the same as you, can you point me to some resources that will allow me to auto-invest without the crazy high transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:21:19
Is this a sign that I should start buying some bit coin? Would it be smart to move 1-2% of my savings to Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:40:09
Oh so my $100 I have in bitcoin now is going to become $1000. Sweet. I better hurry up and buy buy buy. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:07:33
Now you wait while it sits pending for weeks! 
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:27:16
Ah, okay. This is the first time I've dealt with money exchange as a means of investing. 
I've never traded before. So that looks like something I need to research a little more.
