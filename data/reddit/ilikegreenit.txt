Again, ELI5 - How would dynamically changing the block size affect someone running a node? Maybe a little more disk space, maybe a little more badwidth. If bitcoin grows, isn't that going to mean the same thing for (free) node runners anyway?

It's my understanding that Bitcoin won't work without the blockchain. But there is no reason why banks, NASDAQ, anyone, couldn't come up with their own blockchain/ledger and use their own servers to do their own thing. A blockchain/ledger can be created by anyone and used for anything.
So, I think your question is, if XYZ company wants to use blockchain technology, do they have to use Bitcoin's blockchain? The answer is no.

On my 2nd attempt at an Amazon card, egifter 'lost' it, and it didn't show in my wallet. They found it after 24 hours (with  several emails and calls to them).

I’m confused about anonymity. Let’s say I have, say a coinbase wallet, and they have my real information. If I get 1btc on their system (let’s say Address “X”), and then send it to a paper wallet that I create on something like bitaddress.org. (Address “Y”). Later, I sweep that in to an anonymous wallet somewhere, (Address “Z”) can the block chain follow that bitcoin?
When I go to someplace like bitref.com, it will show me the balance, and when coins get added to that address, but do other sites (blockchain.info) give both the sending and receiving addresses? If you can get both the sending and receiving addresses, then where is the anonymity?
Couldn't someone just follow X to Y to Z?

I agree with most of what's been said here, but I despise how may urge noobs to immediately jump in and buy Hardware wallets.
When first starting out, it is (IMHO) much better to use paper wallets for storage.
Paper Wallets are;
1) Cheaper than hardware wallets
2) If created and stored properly, are just as safe and arguably, safer than hardware wallets
3) you'll learn more about how bitcoin works
4) don't require you to trust anyone. (although small attack vector) You still have to trust hardware wallet programmers, and potential [again, small chance] super hackers.
If you do it correctly, the best thing is to generate and manager your own wallets. Very few coins are stolen by keys being compromised. The overwhelming majority are lost by relying on software/hardware, forgetting passwords, losing 2FA access, losing after leaving them in a third-party's care, or third-party wallets.

Thank you good sir, I am well aware of how coinbase's vault works. I have used them before. No, I did not **bash** them, I simply said the safest thing you can do is to create and control your own private keys. I stand by that statement. Any time you involve another party in your bitcoin storage, it increases the security risk. More security risk = more worry.
If you insist, I was bashing **you** for saying you don't have to worry about your bitcoins if you store them in coinbase's vault.

Yes, you are correct. That is one difference between GDAX and the Gemini exchanges. Gemini will let you deposit funds, and trade immediately before the ACH clears. (Although 'locking' your $$ or BTC withdrawals until your ACH clears) Coinbase on the other hand, won't allow you to trade anything, until your ACH clears. But then there is no 'lock' on withdrawing your coins after the ACH clears and you make a trade. (Although I have found that doing an ACH with Coinbase is generally 2-3 days faster than Gemini.)
That being said, thank you for pointing out the differences. I stand corrected. Maybe I should have said the comparison was Apples to Oranges, to... Strawberries?
**edit:** Gemini doesn't really have an "instant buy" option. per se. The buy part may be 'instant' but the withdrawal/access to your coins is not instant

I see this false statement a lot on reddit.
Gemini exchange does charge .25% for trades. (unless you create liquidity, then it's 0%. Larger trades are less than .25%) You can add ACH funds and buy coins this way.
Coinbase has 2 ways to buy coins. Their traditional ACH deposit/credit card instant buys. They do charge a lot higher percentage for this. (Why?) But, if you use their exchange GDAX, they are just like Gemini, where they charge up to .25% for trades, less for larger trades, and 0% for adding liquidity.
Saying Coinbase costs 2% and Gemini is .25% is comparing apples to oranges.

@_date: 2017-02-08 16:24:53
It's less than .001% - But what does that matter??
I believe paper wallets are more secure than hardware wallets. I feel much more comfortable with my coins in paper wallets, and have learned so much more how bitcoin works. You still have to trust others (yes, it's a small attack vector, but it's still present) with hardware wallets. No one can electronically see my paper where I have it hidden.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:25:47
It's about 6's... They both require KYC, and lots of it. You can do a weekly/daily/hourly coinbase transaction, while Bitwage is just when your paycheck comes.

It’s called bitcoin cost averaging. I have been buying small amounts of bitcoin every other Friday for less than a year. (since April 29, 2016). I’ve spent $30 each paycheck for a total of $685 USD fiat. Today I have just over 1 bitcoin (1.00732372). At the time of this post, that’s about $1275. Not a bad return for very little inconvenience, and a bit of discipline.
For the numbers, this is the address I used ([1GUBk2ARKPy7Qs8jSFP4bFcfaEzUD3hHsv
How did I do it? I used bitwage.com – I set them up and sent them $30 out of every check, gave them my bitcoin address and that was it! I never missed the money out of my check at all.
However, to be honest, if you look at the purchase prices, there pretty much on the high side. Especially today’s buy. I bought .02300111 btc for $30 at about 3pm EST – that works out to a cost of $1304.28/bitcoin. Bitstamp was trading at right around $1266/bitcoin. That’s about 3% more than spot. Bitwage says they charge 1.5%, plus the price they offer you is about 1.5% above spot. So, after today, I’ll probably be buying coins for .25% over spot at Gemini or GDAX.
I’ve been waiting for a long time to make this post. As me anything…

I agree with 1, 3, and 4, but paper wallets are much less cumbersome, you don't have to **trust** anyone if you make them yourself, there is much less chance of technical issues, and they cost nothing compared to a nano S. He's much better off buying another $60 in bitcoin.

I'm interested in this. Say you want to buy $500 worth of bitcoin from Gemini. You initiate an ACH deposit to Gemini, and they let you buy immediately. Cool, but then you have to wait 5-7 days to be able to transfer those coins out. Even 3 and 4 days after the ACH has been deducted from your bank.

CHINA'S regulators are studying measures to limit transactions that use bitcoins to take funds out of the country, according to people familiar with the matter.
Officials are considering policies including restricting domestic bitcoin exchanges from moving the cryptocurrency to platforms outside the nation and imposing quotas on the amount of bitcoins that can be sent abroad, the people said.
Regulators noticed recently that some investors bought bitcoins on local exchanges and sold them offshore, evading rules on foreign exchange and cross-border fund flows, the people added. They declined to be identified because the information isn't public.
Bitcoin has surged 21 per cent since the end of September as the yuan's declines accelerated, boosting speculation Chinese investors were buying the cryptocurrency as a hedge against further weakness.
With the risk of quicker depreciation rising along with the odds of an impending US interest-rate hike, policy makers are seeking to restrict outflow channels.
The government classified bitcoin as a commodity and not currency in 2013, placing it outside the purview of the foreign-exchange regulator, the people said. BLOOMBERG

CARACAS, Venezuela—Venezuela is taking nearly half the country’s bank notes out of circulation beginning Wednesday, threatening to ruin the holiday season for Venezuelans already suffering from dire cash shortages, hyperinflation and an economic meltdown.
The country’s largest bill, worth 100 bolivars or just 3 U.S. cents on the black market, is to become illegal, in a move designed to combat contraband along Venezuela’s borders, the government said.
President Nicolás Maduro said outlawing the notes would destroy what he claims are Colombian smuggling mafias that hoard bolivars to buy price-controlled food and gasoline in Venezuela, which is then resold at a markup. Mr. Maduro said Monday night he was closing the Colombian border until Thursday night to prevent stacks of bolivars from making it back to the country.
Buying a kilogram of tomatoes already requires a stack of at least 32 100-bolivar bills in Venezuela, where banks and credit-card terminals are scarce outside state capitals and ATMs give out a maximum of $2 a day in the national currency, the bolivar. Now it will take at least twice that many.
Venezuelans have just two days to deposit into banks the more than six billion targeted bills currently in circulation. Anyone wanting to exchange the worthless bills after that will have 10 days to submit them at the central bank after being questioned by the secret police, Mr. Maduro said in an unexpected announcement on Sunday.
For people in rural areas, such as the fishing village of Macuro in the east, the withdrawal of the basic means of payment means nothing short of disaster ahead of Christmas.
“I have no idea how I will buy presents,” said José Kelly, a fisherman, noting he is three hours away by boat from the closest bank or debit-card terminal. “It’s all cash here, all in 100-bolivar notes.”
“Fraudsters and mafiosos, the fruit of your racket will stay worthless abroad,” Mr. Maduro told supporters waving Cuban and Venezuelan flags. The communist island, Venezuela’s closest ally, pulled off its own currency exchange in two days in 1961.

“The person who works, works. He has his [bank] account and he has all our support,” added Mr. Maduro.
Elsewhere, India last month made its largest bank note unusable, part of an effort to thwart tax dodging, terrorism funding and government corruption. The move has proved to be a major disruption to the economic life of the world’s fastest-growing economy, especially for the most impoverished Indians.
Venezuela’s new measure will also particularly hit the poorest residents in whose name the ruling United Socialist Party claims to govern.
“Life has been very hard and now it will only get harder,” said Junior Rodríguez, who sells traditional cheese sticks known as tequeños on the streets of the Caricuao shantytown in the capital’s west end.
Mr. Rodríguez, a father of three, said that he would now probably have to abandon his stand as most of his clients have already been struggling to find the seven 100-bolivar bills needed to pay for his tequeños.
The collapse of the Venezuelan economy has left the government struggling just to print its own bank notes, making the 100-bolivar bill a scarce item and forcing banks to limit in-person cash withdrawals to the equivalent of $2.50 a day. Venezuela’s frenzied printing of bank notes, mostly done abroad because of local ink and paper shortages, is fueling inflation running at 470% this year and expected to hit 1,600% next year, the International Monetary Fund says.
‘This is going to generate chaos starting tomorrow if the government is unable to introduce the new bills.’
—Opposition lawmaker José Guerra
The president of the central bank said last week that new higher-denomination notes of up to 20,000 bolivars would begin to circulate on Thursday. But even at the most optimistic projections, economists say it would take months to print enough new bills and filter them through the economy.
As of November, Venezuela had 6.1 billion 100-bolivar notes in circulation, almost half of all cash in use and more than quadruple the number of such notes at the end of 2014, according to the central bank.
“This is going to generate chaos starting tomorrow if the government is unable to introduce the new bills,” said José Guerra, an opposition lawmaker and former head of economic studies at the central bank.

Byrne first revealed Overstock’s new blockchain stock offering in October at a fintech conference in Las Vegas, and over the past month, any existing Overstock shareholder could subscribe to take part. Today, the company actually moved the stock into investor accounts, including 126,565 shares traveling via tØ’s blockchain technology. Investors can begin trading the shares via the blockchain tomorrow. The Securities and Exchange Commission officially green-lit the operation last December, and Byrne says his company spent $5 to $6 million in legal fees securing regulatory approval from both the SEC and FINRA, the financial industry’s private overseer.

I'm still trying to get my head around why core wants try to use SegWit before even considering raising the block size to just 2MB. I've heard that it's because LN will be easier to implement after SegWit, and that will be a boon to Blockstream. True? 
Serious question.
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:55:36
you're right! It **is** simple. If everyone pays a higher fee to get on the blockchain, then we can have more transactions!
Higher fees will in turn create more space on that block, and everyone will be able to get their transactions confirmed! Why didn't someone this if this before? Brilliant! /s

You do that pretty well. Just like Core begging for &gt; 30% acceptance of SegWit.
Core: "You can't play on my Bitcoin network unless you stop blocking SegWit. - snif snif - If you don't stop it, imma taking my ball home to my mommy and ruining the game for the rest of you by making you suffer with unacceptable transaction fees, and limited confirmations. Waaaa waaaa waaaa" - Holding their breath and stomping their feet.
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:10:09

can you ELI5? I'm a relative newcomer to bitcoin (mid-June), and there's something I don't get. 95% of the discussion I've seen is about the block size.
But it's my understanding that BIP101 has more code in it than just an increase in block size to 8mb. [ie: IP address blocking, if certain conditions are met]
Will you ELI5, and tell us, with all the contentious talk about blocksize increase, why didn't you just go with Mike's [only-bigblocks]( code, instead of adding IP address blocking?
I've seen others cry "conspiracy"! And to a noob, it kinda looks that way. It looks like you guys are trying to sneak in other (unpopular/not-well-documented?) code while everyone is transfixed on block size. Can you tell us why you chose to go with BIP101 and not go with big blocks only code?

Agree with you 100%!
I've been 'Bitcoin' cost averaging for about a year and a half. Every 2 weeks. Never fail. However, I didn't go the coinbase route. They are too expensive!
OTOH, with over 40 buys from an exchange, and transferring those buys to a single address, it's going to cost me about 2 deposits worth of coins in fees, just to transfer that money out! And that is watching the unconfirmed transactions, checking when it's cheap. There is a lot of data that goes in to dollar cost averaging...
However, the 750%+ gain kinda makes it worth while...

Oh, I certainly get correlation does not imply causation. But then again, correlation does not *disprove* causation either.
Since the first halving, the prices have never returned to such lows. 
Now, using your logic, you could have just said that [David Petraeus Resigning as CIA Director] ( that same month, was the cause of bitcoin going up 1800% in 5 months. But I think it makes more sense that the halving had more to do with it.

So, Bitcoin 20 years in the future. Every single bit of money has been sent a zillion times. Won't *all* transaction fees then be $4.10 (or .0149 btc) per transaction?
Or, with that 1000 input partial bitcoin pieces, turned in to 1 full bitcoin, only be 1 transaction when it gets spent? (or does it carry the baggage of all of its pieces with it forever...?) How far back does each transaction go? Does it clear out the transactions? If not, I would think it should...

I don't know, everyone throws out these huge numbers on why it's impossible to find a private key from a public key. But "1000x" is a good sized number too...

The last halving occurred in November of 2012. ($12/coin) 5 months later, the price was $219/coin. And then promptly dropped to $83. But it way more than doubled. Sure, the BTC economy was a lot different then. But... how much so?

Let's say your in-laws have a 500 bitcoin worth. Seems to me you have 3 issues here. Buying that much coin at once, volatility, and selling that much coin at once.
If you make arrangements beforehand with someone there to buy 500 btc, and someone here to sell 500 btc, then the volatility is mostly a moot point. Buy there, transfer here, sell here.
The problem is, if you can't buy all 500 coins at once, or sell them all at once, volatility comes back in to play.
As far as buying and selling 500 btc at once, I haven't had that problem... yet... :)

Long term, agreed. Short term, no. We're throwing $10,000+ USD at miners every 10 minutes now. $5,000+ after the halving. Hash rate is skyrocketing... There are a lot of miners out there. They don't need a fee market. **Yet**

I read last week an (older) article on why [Wall Street would use the Bitcoin Blockchain, not create their own Blockchain](  (a good read if you haven’t seen it).  Anyway, they talked about a “short little message” attached to each bitcoin transaction.
Can someone explain, with some coherent detail, how this message can be used, how long it is, what this has to do with colored coins and sidechains, and maybe some real world applications? Plus how do you access this message via the popular wallet web sites. (coinbase, Blockchain.info, etc.) I’ve never seen anyway to add a message.
Let’s say I ran a real estate title search company, how could that help my company? And, as companies use the Blockchain for ‘proof of ownership’ type transactions, (vs. buy/sell stuff), couldn’t they just use dust amounts (plus a little transaction fee) to record stuff? And if so, wouldn’t that just be a burden on the network? (vs. using bitcoin to buy/sell something)
The more I research this technology, the more fascinated I am with it, and I’m surprised it’s not grown even faster…
[edit: added sidechains question]

Can someone explain to me (in Bitcoin for idiots style) why this is so?
Say I have 1 bitcoin.
And then I split it up in to 4 equal chunks of .25 bitcoin, and sent them to 4 different addresses. Same bitcoin size, same data size (I assume), and same time-frame (all within 5 minutes of each other). Yet each was charged a different fee. Two of them were charged .0001, one was charged .00022527, and the final one was charged .00003333. I know we're only talking 2.5¢, 5.6¢, and 0.8¢, none of which is a big deal. But, why are the fees so different on 4 different transactions all the same amount, data size, and time-frame? What am I missing?

Seriously... isn't it **way** to early for a fee market? There are tons of miners right now. They've survived skyrocketing hash rates, wild price fluctuations, etc. and yet they seem to be running the strongest computer network (by far, they say) just fine. Seems to me maybe we could use a little thinning of the miner heard. Bitcoin doesn't need to think about a fee market at the expense bitcoin adoption.

@_date: 2016-02-25 16:05:37
[try this?](
My (simple) understanding of Lightning Network is this: Say Grocery Store A: (GSA) takes 10 bitcoin off of the main chain. Reserves it so to say, to use on the lightning network. Now they can trade with Customer A (CA), Customer B (CB), etc. off of the main blockchain. But, CA can also trade and do business with CB and CZ, and also Grocery Store C, and so on. Say 100 people are using that 10 bitcoin off of the bitcoin blockchain. But, any one who wants to can call a final settlement, and ask that their portion be validated on the main blockchain. Then, whoever owns any part of those 10 coins at that moment, gets it validated by the main blockchain.
I'm sure this is a really simplistic answer, and I'm probably missing something, but that's what I've heard.

As I've said before, I've used hundreds of paper wallets. I know what they are, I know how to use them, they aren't a "pain in the ass", and they are more secure than a hardware wallet.

The **best** and safest way to store your coins is on a correctly created, printed, and stored paper wallet.
Consider all of the attack vectors on your HW, plus, in the end, what do you do with your 12 secret words? You write them down on paper! So essentially, your HW is only as secure as that piece of paper anyway. Why add that security risk, plus all of the other risks of rogue programmers, etc.
Simple, correctly created paper wallets.

Doesn't make sense. You're trusting the hardware wallet programmers, and BIOS software programmers (often updated) to keep your crypto safe. ***I*** am my bank, and ***I*** need to make sure my computer is clean and safe to create a paper wallet. Once that's done, hands down, if you HODL, paper wallets are much safer than any electronic device.
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:47:58
Their BIOS isn't open sourced.
Besides, if you have a group of 4 or 5 nerdling programmers who are upset with the world, and they have the opportunity to throw a few extra lines of code in there, sending private keys of maybe 200 whale holders to their own database, and if each could make 10 million dollars, you think they're going to care about any GPLv3 rules and regulations?

From the [ZeroHedge article]( quoting WSJ article;
"The move is notable because until last week, many China bitcoin entrepreneurs thought authorities might shut down only commercial trading activity while tolerating peer-to-peer, or over-the-counter, bitcoin platforms, which enable buyers and sellers to find each other and trade directly. However, it now appears that this was only the beginning as two years after we first warned that bitcoin will be used largely to circumvent Chinese capital controls (and said it would soar as a result when its price was just $230), the government has decided to put a complete end to the use cryptocurrencies as a means of offshoring "hot money." Word of a more serious tightening spread after the meeting and at least one Chinese platform last week announced it would halt one-on-one trading services per official instructions."
"Meanwhile, keep an eye on the price of bitcoin. If the news of today's expanded Chinese crackdown fails to send the price of cryptos lower, the market may have "priced in" China's aggressive intervention. In which case, the next move may be higher, and substantially so."

2) You have to trust BIOS update programmers. Could do the same thing.

You seem to forget Bitderberg, it doesn't matter what fee you pay. There is only so much room. If you pay a higher fee, you're kicking someone else off of the block. Higher fees only make miners richer, they don't help with the adoption of Bitcoin.

I've complained, yes. But today, most mobile wallets down allow for fee manipulation.
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:08:07
Agreed. Again, that option is not available to thousands of people who have most mobile wallets. And, if I pay an extra fee, that just kicks someone else's transaction down the road. There's just not enough space for transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:30:37
Ok, forget "attack"... What about 1923 Weimar Republic type hyperinflation? Let's say Columbia has a financial crisis and hyperinflation ([possible?]( small amounts of people buy bitcoins, and it grows. And the 'default' currency becomes bitcoin. Isn't that the same thing?

I think Electrum is only a desktop wallet(?) My employer has blocked any extra open ports, so I'm out with a desktop app. I think MyCelium has fees you can manipulate, but that would be such a pain to check the size of the mempool before every transaction.

Ok, if I concede that point, and SegWit is perfect, will have no detrimental effects whatsoever (I'm not convinced, but I'll play along), you still have a huge hole in your argument.


I'll call you on this, and say you're just using FUD. A lot of us here are just simple guys enjoying learning about bitcoin. From the simple man's view, double sized blocks allow 2x the amount of transactions. And less fees. It's a win-win. I don't see anything close to your "nothing but risk" claim
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:37:05
Two great iOS wallets are Bread and Mycelium. (hint: got to their websites, and use their links to download the wallet. There have been scammers with scammy wallets posted on the Apple site, and I'm sure the Android site)

You've gone from 


to 


That is/was my entire point. There is risk in everything. There is risk in not doing anything, there is risk in a pure 2MB block size increase, there is risk in a BU style increase, and yes, there is risk in SegWit.
To your point that 


I call FUD. There is also much reward in raising the block size.
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:58:45
Nice, and thank you.
But, my mobile wallet doesn't give an option to change/increase fees. (yes, I've complained)
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:06:16
No, I get it, and I don't mind paying extra. But that option wasn't given to me (and thousands of others). Besides, if I pay more fee, then that bumps someone else off the 'train'
(And it was **48 Satoshi per byte, not 48 Satoshi total**)

falling, from $2000 to $2400 today.
You get your info from...?
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:51:40
I get that.
I also get that there are only so many seats on the train, and if I pay 50¢ extra next time, I'm bumping someone else off the train. That's not good for Bitcoin adoption.
My question was, if my tx is still waiting at the train station watching trains go by without me, how do I leave the station (drop tx from mempool)?

Yes, Breadwallet supports HD wallet 12 word recovery phrase.
Agreed 100%, don't play with brain wallets.
Having said that, the safest thing a person can do is to generate and manager their own private keys. If you opt for hardware wallets, you must trust the manufacturer that they don't backdoor your private keys during production, or any software updates to your device. 
See this post
Friendly reminder: When using a hardware wallet you are trusting that the hardware wallet company hasn't been corrupt before the day your hardware wallet was shipped to you.
So, absolutely I would recommend storage of bitcoin on a (properly created and stored) paper wallet, more than I would a hardware wallet. Nothing more secure than open source bitaddress.org code, on a freshly wiped machine, having never touched the internet, and using 16 sided dice to roll your own private keys.
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:16:27
So, $1500 is 1/2 way annoying? LOL
when did it hit $2,000?
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:40:13
What a troll. Full blocks = no growth
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:20:19
And I'm glad you understand that there still aren't enough seats on the train, and that when I'm willing to pay extra, it bumps someone off that block.
Sounds like that plan is just ingratiating the miners.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:08:43
Well, that's polite
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:06:41
Still, at $2/day, you're paying an 8.5% fee for your coins, no?
(15 cents is 7.5 cents per dollar [7.5%] plus your 1% fee)
I love dollar cost averaging (bitcoin cost averaging). I spend about the same as you do, but I buy 2x a month (when I get my check) and use the exchanges (gemini or GDAX). they charge only .25%
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:44:49
So what I'm asking for is, what were my choices after I sent the tx. Rather than your answer,


That's not real helpful. I would guess there are thousands of users of popular mobile wallets that aren't going to switch to Electrum.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:17:34
How can you do that with transaction fees so high now?
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:41:54


Who in the world are you to say what's fun or not? Are you the bitcoin CEO?
Whatever... Full blocks and no "fun" transactions = zero growth
@_date: 2015-10-16 03:35:38
Still not worth it. Trust me. You'll spend 8 hours a day trying to get that $1.
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:16:44
Say this makes core devs realize (unlikely) that BTC actually does need bigger blocks. If they then signal to the miners that they will agree to 2MB or Unlimited blocks, how long before this could actually take place? I really need my transaction to go through!
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:37:20
Your logic is not sound.
You: 2M does nothing but introduce risk
Me: A pure 2MB upgrade has less risk than tons of code and squeezing 1.7MB worth of tx in a 1MB block
You: Wu and Ver have endorsed SegWit, so they get what they want, so your argument if flawed.
Wait... What...?
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:06:07
THAT... is hilarious.

Where is ??
To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:16:08


Haha... you certainly have been drinking the kore kool-aid
There is little risk in (only) raising the block size to 2MB (vs. BU or some of the other proposals). The risk/reward ratio is extremely good.
Squeezing data down so that you can fit in 1.7MB worth of data in a 1MB block, and changing a LOT of code, introduces more risk than just changing the block size. The risk/reward ratio is a lot worse with this option
@_date: 2016-05-27 20:25:28
This is why I use paper wallets.
People say Trezor this, HDD Wallet that, or a secure thumb drive.
Sorry, human memory, electronic failures, hardware failures, etc. can let you lose bitcoin. They may make things more convenient, but not as safe.
Sorry, secure paper wallets created correctly and stored correctly will always be my choice.

@_date: 2015-11-02 21:19:10
It doesn't explicitly "mean" anything. But, on the other hand, it "could" mean that older coins are being taken out of storage and being sold. Which is good if you're long (a HODL'er). It could also mean nothing, or that folks are just moving their coins around ready to sell when the market hits its peek, in just one hour, and is heading to $1/coin. [I dunno, but I like to think old coins are being sold...]

As good as coinbase is (or as bad as it is as some people think), if you store coins there, you don't control your private keys. *If* something (anything really) happened, your coins are not protected. Coin base (as was Mt.  Gox) is a private company and has no guarantees of the safety of your coins. Most sites don't. Keep your one keys. [On 2nd thought, I think Gemini is FDIC insured]
