Deleting this now.   Wouldn't want it showing up as fud.

These are two things I won't do: 1. Buy mavericks tickets.  2. Buy mavericks tickets with bitcoin.

That was me...

I figured that's what it was.   Subpar tech with all the momentum.    Wouldn't be the first time it's happened.  
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:49:22
Whew, thought I was going to have to do it.

That's true.   Bitcoin reaching 1 million will not cause milk to go to $100.

Keep it up mudder fudders!

It could be a lot worse.. Trust me.  Just think about the dude that threw away 1400 BTC or the 10k btc pizzas. My story isn't as bad as those but it's much worse than yours.   It can always be worse.   You'll be alright man.

Seriously though, how does this happen?  I'll watch it dance for days and if I buy, it drops like a rock.  If I sell, it takes off.   Every damn time.

Somewhere around a million per BTC.   When this happens, realize that a gallon of milk will likely cost today's equivalent of $100.

Buy twice as much at 12.8k.  Wash the original 19k investment with a ripe alt coin.   If that doesn't take the taste away, double down and do it again.

Truth... Best buy employee emparted his words of wisdom on me tonight after overhearing wife and I discuss BTC: "Bitcoin is nothing but trouble,  those people are just asking to go broke".

You are now a legend.

Was hoping for fish but was instead taught to fish.   Thank you kind sir.

I have only have .5 bitcoin that I've built up from mining alt coins and trading up the past year or so.   It's not a lot, but it's mine.   I'm going to invest where I can.   For me financial freedom will be paying off my mortgage.   At that point I can just be a  Walmart greeter and be happy instead of working 60+ hours a week.   Good luck to all.

I only have .005 BTC in Bittrex right now and just want to combine it with my other BTC.  At todays value they want $10 for me to be able to make a withdrawal.

WTF is happening?

They're proving that  onchain scaling degrades decentralization and bigger block sizes as a way of better scalability will fail.  So they're saying that BCH was a pointless fork and should have zero value.    If you're holding BCH, it's dump-thirty and the banks about to close.
