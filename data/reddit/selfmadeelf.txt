If one wants to shut down Bitcoin, you have to shut down the internet - good luck with that. 
@_date: 2019-11-26 07:59:02
This was my initial thought too, however their point was that this specific bank was "unsafe" and was therefor blocked.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:34:39
I don't see the reason not to tell them the truth.
@_date: 2019-03-08 12:16:53
What if I take a picture of the private key with an old Kodak one-use camera and keep the camera somewhere?
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:09:00
The bank is called Swedbank. The marketplace is called Bitstamp.
I wanted to withhold this info because I thought it was sensitive. I guess I will find out soon enough.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:11:47
I just wanted share my story, nothing more to it really...
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:20:28
I am not sure what that is.
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:04:19
Interesting. I know that I am not supporting Bitcoin directly when I want to use an exchange like Bitstamp. My initial idea was to experiment and have an open mind to form my own thought about it. However, now I am not so sure about this anymore. I don't want to side with the banks, that is for sure, they should let me do what I want with my money. But, I understand they might have done this for my own sake.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:00:55
What do you want to know? I just had a discussion with my bank and they basically told me that they don't allow their customer to make transactions like this because it is either scam or against their policy.
@_date: 2019-11-26 08:11:05
Bitcoin, the technology, is the future of a stable economy. It might have surfaced a bit early in time. We seem to not understand the bigger picture of it, instead in this day and age we act all greedy and foolish around its birth.
I really like what you wrote and I do think I agree with you.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:20:28
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:21:01
They asked, so I told them the truth.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:21:06
Not my friend anymore atleast.
@_date: 2019-11-26 07:59:41
I am in EU.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:18:03
I just did.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:12:58
You are right. For me Bitcoin means future technology. That my own bank would deny me a Bitcoin purchase is a scandal.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:21:21
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:15:01
Sorry to hear that, just look forward, don't look backwards.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:20:02
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:13:58
The information is in this thread.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:32:57
 What bank from and to? - Not sure I can post that kind of information here.
 What 'transactions like this'? - A EU/EES SEPA transaction.
 Do they know its intended for crypto? - The support asked me what the transaction was for, so I told them the truth.
 Why do you need to transfer it between banks to begin with?  - Not sure I can post the platform name I am using. They platform requires me to send money to a specific bank to be able to use funds on their site in order to buy and sell Bitcoin.  
   
 How are you trying to transfer it? - Not sure what you mean here. I am using the internet service that my bank provides.
Which Cryptocurrency marketplace? - Not sure I can post that kind of information here, sensitive?
The account that I was trying to transfer too, is not a bank where I have an account in.

Thanks for this comment, this was honestly what I was looking for. Everyone else seems to think I am posting for fun or talking bullshit.
@_date: 2019-03-18 08:25:30
Most educated people act like they are "educated" and therefor whatever they say is better and more valuable. Also, whatever you ask them, they can answer it, but it doesn't really matter how they answer it - because they are educated. I went to a fancy school, I guess that means I am one of "them", I am an educated one. But I feel ashamed sometimes when people ask me what I work with, because if I answer that, they start acting different. I wish I never went to that fancy school, I wish I could have activated my brain somehow without being educated.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:19:17
This is the kind of comment I am looking for.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:17:57
Yeah, I don't understand how they can make it this obvious that they are this much against it. Let their customers do what they want with THEIR money, right? Disappointing to say the least...
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:00:02
Tomorrow I am having a meeting with another bank. My first question is going to be "am I going to be allowed to buy Bitcoin with my money here?", then let the rest of the meeting be decided by that.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:17:48
I just named the bank.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:15:49
Sorry, I misinterpret your previous comment.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:13:00
I really wanted to make it obvious that I am taking a course of action against this. People need to know this, this is information that you might know and think is trivial, but not everyone is like you.
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:18:33
Bitcoin is what you want it to be - except a fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:57:25
What is it being mined with today?
@_date: 2018-11-07 13:14:23
I usually never post because of the fear of spreading FUD like this, so I guess I made an honest mistake here (at least just a mistake). My intention was not to spread false information. I put the first article there and then the other one there too, so that it would look like two sides of the coin, but I failed it seems.
I really do hope people see that the post was made in order to seek the truth about it and not spread dogshit. I have learned my lesson.
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:47:17
I was thinking since Bitcoin mining requires a lot of graphic cards - they are bought more - which makes the companies that make them profit, which inspires them to make more and better ones?
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:35:22
What is going on? I just got home from work and my alerts on my phone just went off
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:59:37
aah, I see!
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:10:25
Recently I have come to realize that no one really knows or could state with a definitive answer on what is going on with Bitcoin most of the time.
@_date: 2019-05-09 09:18:01
Is  [ an exchange? I am a bit confused in the terminology here.
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:19:44
I have been reading a bit too much about Bitcoin lately, become more and more interested. Somewhere along the line I think I got scared too. Trying to control my feelings and thoughts I think I just needed to ease my hunger for "what's next" or "what's will happen if". The only place I know I can ask a weird question and get a decent answer is here, you proved it, thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:12:05
I just want to appriciate the one who did this, cheers!  
PS: Current price in the tab on the browser is GOLDEN!

Ty for links!
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:33:07


Wow, interesting!!  
I just read it really quick now, but could it be possible between more than two parties? Say, like 5, 10 or 15? Couse then smoke shops or just small shops in general could start taking payments in bitcoin and that would be a breakthrough I think.
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:08:41
Well said again dude! I can agree on the fact that some people tend to tunnelvision and herd. I have always questioned things and been punished for it, therefore I don't do that very often anymore. Nowadays I like to listen and watch, I guess that is me leaning towards the herd-mentality.
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:59:20
yap, I expressed an opinion on another subreddit and I felt the downvote hammer... it was heavy 
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:09:35
Thanks again!
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:25:36
Let me check it out
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:13:37
Interesting!  
My idea with the post was to get some kind of reply just like this in the lines of "something's gotta give" continued with what and how
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:09:32
Can I ask why you ask?
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:44:24
So.........  
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:26:14
Let's just put it like this: I invested enough
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:13:38
I was excited some weeks ago when we had that big drop. I thought to myself "Finally something is happening!" and then I went on looking through the internet for information like a kid looking through a toy store's broschyr.
Today I am like "Hmm, I wonder how a bear would look like in a suit and tie"
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:59:36
We are living in the Information Era I believe, where information has become a tool and a weapon. I just don't understand why people would want to destroy something as innovative as Bitcoin? Are we not all humans that all want to evolve and advance?  
I see your point buddy, I am just disapointed if it is true...
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:40:56
@_date: 2018-12-04 07:01:51


that's where I cracked LOL
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:25:06
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:00:43
I understand this, but I was hoping that people would understand my question on a deeper level... I don't even really know what I am asking, but I am just trying to see beyond the BTC/FIAT question, but I can't formulate the question without including it, because I want to some ideas on what will happen if Bitcoin breaks the economy? I guess that is what I am asking... hmm
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:08:37
well spoken sir
