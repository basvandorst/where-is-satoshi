If you don't control your own private keys, you are at the mercy of Coinbase as to whether you even have the option of claiming the forked coins.

Well I sold XRP for $2.28 So pretty happy. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:14:34
Even XRP is going down. This theory doesn't hold. I think it is end of year selling just like you see in the public stock markets. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:58:44
True. But if the issue is that he is looking for alternative investment vehicles in real estate for a small amount that is an option.

Almost All exchanges have APIs that enable automated trading tools.

There is a ton of forks mentioned in this article:
I have only seen public instructions on how to claim some of the ones mentioned in the article.  (Don't want to mention any of the names for fear that this comment will be deleted by the mods...)

There is a perspective that buying thru an ATM might be harder to track by the taxman. You put cash in. HODL. Many years later you sell by collecting cash out of the ATM. The result is a capital gain without a paper trail.

My expectation was that price would have been depressed as we approach the fork because after the fork, some of the BTC value would be transferred to BCH (I refuse to call it BCC) meaning that the value would go down.  Part of me wants to sell now at a relatively high price and buy BTC after the fork at a lower price.  I feel like it's almost inevitable that BTC prices will go down after the fork.  The question is how fast it will recover.
Sigh...I really wish I had a crystal ball.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:24:01
Perhaps, but I like the Kraken dashboard better so I use it more.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:21:47
I'm not sure if the liquidity argument holds water right now.  Just checked Kraken, and average volume the past hour is 400 BTC which is roughly the same level we've seen for the past 11 days.  It was up higher around July 20th...averaged around 1000 BTC/hr for a few hours that day.  
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:15:28
It's going to be a shit-show.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:40:13
It did show up. All of the exchanges are suffering from the same problem...huge increase in volume and not enough staff to handle the increase. They are getting better. In my case three of the transfer issues were my bank not Kraken. I like kraken a lot... they have been good to me. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:28:31
It feels like much of the Western world is favoring BTC.  Without a doubt the Chinese will favor BCH.  The question is whether South Korean and Japanese traders favor the BTC vs. BCH side, since those are very important markets for liquidity.  
I think you're right in holding both sides of the chain to see which one has lasting value.  For BTC, the bigger issue is what happens in November...until that happens it might be a frothy bubbly market for BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:54:17
I agree whole heartedly that the Chinese side could be an interesting play. T-minus about 8 hours. It will be interesting for sure. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:51:37
You can dump BCH for Fiat.  Kraken said they will support the BCH/USD trading pair.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:59:25
Probably suspended everyone's accounts so they can credit BCH. I can't imagine they could do that while also keeping their site up.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:23:03
I think it's short-sighted to think that Bcash and any other altcoins don't take away from the market interest and amount of available capital to invest in crypto.  Every new coin takes available capital away from Bitcoin and hurts the valuation of Bitcoin.  
I guess it's a victim of its success, as this happens all the time.  People see something successful and immediately copy it.  Bitcoin is no different.  I just wonder what the Bitcoin valuation would be if we had no other alts whatsoever....we'd already be at $10k or $15k USD per BTC....instead we're languishing in the $2.5k range....
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:36:06
Ok, I buy that...I don't have Coinbase account to allow me to check that...and as you say, I can't find the stat from Coinmarketcap.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:11:03
True, and there are likely tons of people like myself who are sitting on BTC and wondering if they should sell BCH immediately, or instead sit on it for a little while and see what happens.  
History tells us that a split often favors both sides of the chain.  Look at ETC and ETH...Even ETC held its value (albeit less than ETH)
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:20:00
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:12:29
BCH is the ticker symbol most exchanges will use for Bitcoin Cash. They are not using BCC because there is already another BCC in the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:22:13
Meanwhile Kraken and all other BTC-related sites are struggling to keep up with the volume of hits....
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:53:37
And what do you say to the folks living in a well-managed first-world economy where inflation is held firmly in check?
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:01:24
The buy and sell side of BTC/USD pair on Kraken is faaaar more balanced.

Not that I think we are anywhere near the top, remember that pigs get fed but hogs get slaughtered.  Beware of excessive greed.  Before you invest you should have an idea of what your target exit is. When it reaches it, execute the trade and don't regret anything that happens after.

I use Tabtrader's API to keep track of prices on Kraken and I have been seeing this happen for a couple days now. It started with Ethereum...

Crap! I was considering getting one.

Correct. And to put a finer point on things, the need for insurance only exists because banks use leverage and don't actually hold your money.

 If one person cornered the market that would be silly. Bitcoin benefits from the network effect. More owners = more value for BTC. They would be destroying one of the fundamentals that drives price. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:18:50
 Good point. Another idea the OP may want to consider. Just use Bitcoin ATMs to withdraw local fiat currency while traveling.

You would need to buy in several smaller purchases over time otherwise you will move the market and pay too much. Many people recommend Genesis for large purchases. I've never used them so I can't advocate for them.
As for storage, get a dedicated hardware storage device like Trezor or Nano and store it somewhere safe.

Under the Kraken logo on the top left hand side of the screen, you'll see a pull-down menu allowing you to select currency pairs.  You need to select XBT/CAD before you can create a trade.  Once that's selected you should be able to do what you want.
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:19:10
Thanks. I've looked at these other options and the price of bitcoin is consistently higher there than Kraken. Also three transaction fees are higher. Is there nothing better out there???
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:25:51
Funny, I had a meeting two weeks ago with an investment advisor...she was asking me the same types of questions.  Clearly the established investment community is looking seriously into Bitcoin, which I think is a sign of things to come.  I really hope a split in the chain doesn't screw things up for us right now!
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:13:38
I've used Kraken a lot to trade.  But the wire transfers from Canadian banks take TONS OF TIME going through their intermediary in Japan.    Some of my money is currently stuck and the ticket I logged 2 weeks ago to sort it out has yet to be answered.  Their fees are great, decent liquidity, but awful speed of transferring money in and out.  I have completely missed out on this latest rally because of them.  
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:52:02

I just bought more at $2800 CAD (yes, I'm Canadian), but it doesn't stop me from seeing the floor drop out from under me.  But I'm a believer...
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:56:52
I agree. This is all about negative BCH sentiment. The futures are way down which makes BTC holders believe that a split will not hurt their BTC valuation as much.
@_date: 2017-07-15 04:59:06
RSI is sitting just over 25. Technical analysis would suggest that is when you buy.  I admit i bought too soon but I'm hoping we have seen the floor and that will signal a small recovery.
