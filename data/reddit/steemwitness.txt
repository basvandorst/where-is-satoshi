The irony here is a single company can be responsible for such effect in Bitcoin. Guess Bitcoin isn't really decentralized like it was said to be after all

The point of decentralization is to remove the mass amounts of control from individual companies as well as their single point of failure.
Do you not see the relation to my comment?

If it decentralized with a company having some level of control over it then it isn't really decentralized now is it?
How would a decentralized exchange process customer refunds for whatever reason? If the exchange got hacked are they going to refund everyone like an FDIC insured exchange will?

Or he does and doesn't care because Bitcoin is fraught with issues and other cryptos have advanced beyond. 
I made a killing on Bitcoin. Was mining it with my gpu in 2010. But when it got stuck in emotional drama I moved most my money and thank fucking god I did. 
The users have been ignoring the issues with Bitcoin from the beginning. Now that they are becoming too hard to ignore people start to complain. Better late than never i guess.

He isn't wrong.

Damn. Ouch. But you are right. 
If you think horrible complicated UIs that benefit 1% of the users are the way to go you are an idiot.

It isn't volatility that is the issue. It's a $40-70 transaction fee for a $5-10 purchase. No matter who handles the volatility, that payment simply doesn't make sense. 
No shit they converted to USD instantly. But their customers were out their fee. As many don't know this shit they decided to remove the option altogether. This is bad news for Bitcoin unless it pulls it's tiny head out if it's ass and fixes things.

The ones that did that have multiples tens of millions. I wouldnt cry a river for them. 
I'm a blockchain developer and trust me the income is fine

Bad argument. He's a better investor than r-bitcoin by your example.

If Bitcoin relies on a single company to do anything it is fundamentally flawed.

Someone could do something but they likely didn't do something because of secure enclave. But something and someone.

HitBTC lmfao. Are you just naming random exchanges?
Local bitcoins is hardly an exchange.

If you willingly leave out other crypto like Steem, sure
