Interesting... the date they give is around January 15th for bonuses. 
Also, IIRC the first wave of futures contracts expires January 17. I have a feeling next week is going to be very volatile.... hopefully upwards

All it would take is some $$$ to go to this agency to give a certain coin an A+ rating. So fucked
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:41:40
Ok, I will let the bitcoin people know
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:54:53
Well, no one really knows what impact it will have since this is the first time it’s being done. But generally agencies give ratings to stocks to give people an idea how its doing. I wouldn’t look to deep into it, just interesting to see what ratings they give and what the markets’ reaction to it will be.

It’s important to note how many people out there are hoping for the price to crash so they can say I told you so.

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:07
If GDAX is manipulating and deemed unreliable, that means The CME can’t use their exchange for price points which means how can they continue with futures trading...
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:40:14

Wow I didn’t even consider that but your right. There is going to be a big swing either way and trading will be stopped..
Do you know how long they stop it for

Truth is this is a lesson newcomers need to learn the hard way just like all the hodlers. Most hodlers now probably made the same mistake in the past. Hence the reason we emphasize HODLING so much here.

I am pretty sure this is everyone's worst case scenario with bitcoin futures. I agree with you, I would love to see these banks get short squeezed into bankruptcy
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:26:52
That means they are just suppressing bitcoin potential... smh

Any chance that $ goes back into BTC? They are related in my experience. Money flows from one to others during big runs..

You can’t buy or sell BCH I mean
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:49:51
I would think the money from yesterday’s wall went into bch over the last few hours .. seems plausible since bch is up 20%.. what do you guys think?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:44:09
% of total crypto currency market cap. Used to be 90%.. now it’s 46%
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:22:57
Gbtc was at a huge premium.  There are days Bitcoin goes up 3% and gbtc goes up 20... a correction would make sense but it could also be the impending futures market.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:53:11

What are the implications of this?

money did come in, now its going out
@_date: 2016-06-21 11:32:15
Higher the chance of Brexit, increase in demand. Lower chance, lower the demand. Weekends polls shows votes leaning toward remain. Which could've contributed to price drop.
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:23:51
thanks, emo guy
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:12:47
does it have anything to do with the Brexit polling numbers that came out this weekend?

I think it's pretty clear the Chinese government does not like their country's capital going to bitcoin. I don't get why they don't actually just ban bitcoin or shut down the exchanges? That would solve their problem..?

It’s been bugging me since I saw this. Every time I check the price I see this chart and I can’t figure out why it looks like this
I think this could be due to automated trading systems doing large transactions..

@_date: 2018-03-11 00:45:34
I agree, and that’s what I meant. My perfect scenario is: these altcoins drop low enough to where an SEC ruling can kill them off completely.. leaving Bitcoin relatively unscathed then proceeds to shoot to moon.
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:48:26
I think about this all the time. If you can attach a coin to a face, it’s not decentralized . Satoshi probably understood this .

I strongly believe Amazon is secretly a supporter of Bitcoin. Amazon is an investor in Business Insider, which I receive a lot of my news, and they often report on BTC topics. When the China ban rumors first surfaced they did not immediately jump to publish a piece on it like WSJ and Bloomberg. 
The risk-reward factor of amazon supporting BTC payments makes a lot of sense for them IMO. Puts them ahead of the curve.

I don't think it's as much about cheap coins as it is the threat to the way things have always been done.
It's like denying climate change to keep big oil money coming in.

Another question , why the difference between coinbase and bitcoinity? Which one is more accurate?
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:45:19
Ah clever
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:42:35
Hahah no I watched the reaction of this stock to changes in btc price many times and it often reacts the same way. I'm just concerned about citron research. Don't know what the implications are of the letters they are putting out to the media.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:14:42
How is this not market manipulation? The demand is there that's why the premium is high. No guarantee other ETFs will be approved.

@_date: 2017-09-20 20:36:40
Ah interesting
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:38:23
Others were saying the introduction of LedgerX - BTC option trading had something to do with it. Let me know if you find something please.  
I'm hoping the premium will come back in some way. I've seen GBTC act oddly in relation to actual BTC price. really can't tell what the cause is. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:48:28
It will drop then bounce... then it will either drop or bounce
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:51:24
There is at least 1 person in PR freaking out because he does not know what the current bitcoin price is
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:26:24
Yea but that was announced last week.. how come GBTC didn't go up yesterday. News of BCH distribution has been around for a while. Today's increase has to have something to do with CME

Ore specifically, since Barry Silbert of GBTC supports SegwitX2.. wouldn't that mean X2 would be more beneficial for GBTc price rather than the other? Or no? Somebody research that for me
