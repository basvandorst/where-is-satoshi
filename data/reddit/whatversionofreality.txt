Let's hardfork to another pow. Taking away the power that these miners should have never gotten. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:49:23
Very good. This should save some reddit topics about coins not showing up. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:07:05
One should question their sanity when rooting for the BU team. Seriously.

He must suffer from shortterm memory loss.

By the time his news is real, noone will care. Gg 'PR' department.

Keep spamming.

Guess we have to thank the bottomfeeders in the end, for helping bitcoin become more resilient.

Miner"s".

Do not enter altcoin trading. You're more likely to lose than to gain in the longterm. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:50:04
Sad. It's going to cost them though.

A famous actress plays in these commercials. This is bigger than some random commercial. Actually showed up on the yahoo frontpage.

Spend when necessary.
 Like yesterday there was a big outtage of dutch abnamro ideal. I couldn't pay for my food, luckily I had bitcoin. It was my first 'outdoor' experience where bitcoin felt so much superiour. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 11:10:49
Probably got paid a handsome amount to promote Ether. Just like other exchanges. Sickening.

MacOS runs on most modern pc's if you're tech-savvy enough. Do some searches on hackintosh, tonymac and clover bootloader. I have no idea if macos is safer than windows though.

Fwiw check your internetconnection with pingplotter. Internal change of isp added 30% packetloss on my connection and i had syncing problems and weird disconnects/warping in games. Switched ISP, everything's running smoothly since then.

Jihan, you lost in this timeline. Give it up already. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 23:16:37
Not power. Destruction. Maybe I'm overestimating Ver, but even if his version would win somewhere down the line. He knows the majority probably will leave/sell. BU plummets to &lt;100$.
 Headlines will show bitcoin has finally failed while greedy altcoins try to take bitcoin's place,  probably ruining the 'cryptospace' forever.
Hope I'm just paranoid. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:38:59
Eth is inflationary, why would you possibly bring up this altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:10:21
Then it will fork to new PoW. It would take a lot more to bring bitcoin down. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:59:51
Yeah, no.

Remember all the people who are responsible for obstructing bitcoin and warn any newcomers from their future endeavors. 
They've chosen to obstruct this project, beneficial to all humanity, which is unforgivable.   
/downvoted, wow. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:47:13
It will implode sooner or later. Not worth my attention. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:48:53
You're adorable.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:53:55
The solution has been engineered. Get mad at the people blocking it.
