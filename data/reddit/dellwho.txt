i need a guide how to do this :(
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:21:29
i realise this. :(
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:18:10
thanks man. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:07:47
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:13:54
fake screenshots he sent too :(
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:05:30
ah! So selling on the 9th a great idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:19:08
bout 20% - mine and gfs holdings from the past 5 yrs. Thought we'd take a bit out because - ironically - we thought btc might go down . I am yet to tell her. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:16:22
he insisted on it, feedback seemed like it would be fine. Just was desperate for the cash :(
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:13:10
Seemed a good deal, was not a good deal :(
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:24:38
yes. A sore start of the holidays. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:08:06
Ever noticed how bad news in the usa is good for btc price? Btc is not optimism for the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:05:52
someone is buying btc a $million at a time. Yes it's happening
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:45:33
Without question someone is pumping ready to dump and short on the futures. 30k by dec 14th? Maybe. Huge crash for christmas. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:39:43
Let's be honest she's a whale. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 20:02:36
Totally unrelated to criminal activities, why wouldn't a random kebab shop in Thailand accept a currency 99% used for drugs? 
@_date: 2015-05-17 10:20:54
Can confirm I know her too. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 12:52:51
2010 crew represent. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:13:12
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:23:39
like the cash i had in mt gox when it went under?
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:58:34
No we hodling till it reaches 10, maybe 20k then using it as a deposit on a flat in ldn. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:26:00
i bought my girl £50 in btc in 2013 (1.07 btc)
She lol now. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:13:37
it's unbelievable to see people who believe this. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:26:08
Within the next 5 years I am sure of it but in all honesty we're hoping it reaching 500,000 by 2023. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:35:27
like it's not even the first wall i've seen like this on here 
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:24:03
ehhh maybe I should shuddup!
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:15:42
exactly. House drop price 'cus of brexit + November slump in prices every year + btc princeicnrease to 20k = house in peckham christmas 19 thankyouverymuch50quid
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:13:49
problem is he's shit at business. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:34:33
am considering one of these right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:16:48
because if you hold on forever, what is the point? I'll cash out when I have enough money to travel the world + help to buy a nice flat in London - so probably if it ever reaches 200,000. For the £50 I put into it, that's quite fine. Otherwise you will hold until your too old to spend it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:21:13
I reckon 10k before fork, 7k after
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:27:49
Not on CB, but thanks
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:28:21
I sort of agree... but the opportunity to make a quick buck is a strong one. I have some accounts for HODL and some for pumping and dumping. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:18:24
very much doubt it'll go down before the 15th
@_date: 2012-10-08 10:28:18
and going back up by the minute. Get those bitcoins in, guys. 
@_date: 2012-10-06 11:54:08
legit. 
@_date: 2012-10-04 18:53:19
can confirm blockchain.info and pingit works. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:00:07
the police very much attacked people. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:28:18
well that is but the name of the game I guess!
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:31:34
Yes its called charity you fucking insepid loner 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:36:35
yeah so how the internet works is you see stuff and you show it to other people. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:32:56
In europe we call them D locks. Like we call America retarded. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:43:54
this sub is very anti anything that isn't btc, it's beyond parody. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:37:58
eg America. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:56:17
there's video footage of police full on knocking out women in the street just for being there. Yes they were attacked. Are all Catalonians fucking retards like you? This independence farce makes me think so. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:55:04
yes. Anyone selling before 2020 is an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:47:24
i never turned my pre-august btc into BCash. Should I do this right now?
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:47:24
the fact it's gone up at all makes me inclined to hang on to it. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:40:53
this i like
@_date: 2015-11-05 08:26:33
christ thats depressing 
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:01:50
there's always spikes in the run up to summer/new years because that's the time everyone takes to the darknet. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 22:19:07
Not so bad, less than a years salary for each of us and frankly I would have used it for weed and mdma long ago
@_date: 2015-10-10 22:18:18
Actually I'd have spent it in drugs but yes 
@_date: 2015-10-10 08:12:26
I discovered btc in March 2011. I laughed and told my gf we should by a £100 worth each! We didn't. :( anyone wanna calculate my sads? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:59:54
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:39:14
Easily. Expect 2000 before mid june - glastonbury
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:17:52
BIG lols at the reveal he's sitting on a giant blue ball. Nothing says dot com bubble like that kind of shit in an office. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:35:33
it's called marketing, and if you want this to go anywhere it's not the half-brained literate you need on your side - they already are. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:19:20
I'm in the same boat, bought earlier this week - nadda! Not a reply to my support ticket, fb message, twitter. All I se is transferwise showing they got the money. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:09:23
same boat man. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:48:31
So what you're saying is, if you're in the uk, BUY. 
@_date: 2013-01-18 13:52:36
what the fuck, people? 
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:45:30
i wasn't saying that at all, i did buy early enough thanks! It was just that this looks ridiculous. We need to make bitcoin look like what we want it to be, not what it is.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:51:50
well at the moment its like a chubby neackbeard land on me with a blue space hopper.
