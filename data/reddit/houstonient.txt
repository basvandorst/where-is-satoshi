How dare that site that holds your currency make you have a good password? If that combination scares you I feel bad for the rest of your passwords.

Sorry but correcthorsebatterystaple is not stronger then something like ;is%j&amp;84&amp;jJgkd&amp;483jsJdnd

This sounds like a fantastic idea!

How susceptible is your service to SMS sender spoofing? Could someone spoof my number and clean out my wallet?

But it does matter. No respectable website should store your password in plain text. They are usually stored as a one way hash (and are hopefully salted too.) It matters that it's strong because hashes of crappy passwords are the easiest to crack when databases get leaked. It also matters that it's unique. Just ask those that used the same email and shitty password on the MtGox accout as their paypal, only to find their paypal account cleaned out after the database leak.

Hmm that's not good. Dwolla is the best way afaik to use money to buy bitcoins short of expensive wire transfers. Thanks for the info. I did see a note on Mt. Gox about them accepting Dwolla still for now but wasn't sure what it was about.

Why is this?
@_date: 2011-08-06 23:57:54
Fear. Fear the price will go lower and they will lose even more money then they already have. Personally I don't have much more then $100 invested, so I'm in for the long haul (or fall, which ever it might be.)

When you have literally hundreds of logins, it's almost impossible to not use a password manager, even good memorable passwords there is no way I'm remembering all of them. Make a good memorable password for your password manager, and for bonus points throw in two factor authentication. Then unique generated passwords for everything else.

I think it sucks in general for the bitcoin community. The last thing we need right now is for the process to be more cumbersome or costly for most people.

Instawallet added a feature not to long ago to allow you to send coins from a "green address". This is known address belonging to Instawallet that does not change. The idea behind this was so receivers of coins could say "Yes, I see the transaction and although it isn't confirmed yet, I trust Instawallet." But I can see some benefit in using this same system to mask sending addresses.

Well apparently the public key is on the card, so it should be easy enough to verify that the unknown private key in the card contains the amount of BTC it claims via blockexplorer. Not that that prevents someone from spending the coins after you check, but assuming the tamper evidence really works and you trust BitBills then it should be fairly secure.

Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification!
