BitcoinAverage is planning a Beta launch, we would love to get your feedback on current Bitcoin Price API's and you will also get an invite to the upcoming Beta release: 
@_date: 2016-04-14 03:48:43
thanks for clarifying the address isn't random, just want to make sure folks know that features aren't unlocked by sending coins 
@_date: 2016-04-05 02:48:56
A Bitcoin Price Index API provides an input - BitcoinAverage takes bitcoin prices from different exchanges and provides a global average weighted Bitcoin price. It is often used in apps as the Bitcoin price if you're buying or selling Bitcoin, such as in LocalBitcoins.com, Mycelium, Lamassu, etc.
@_date: 2016-04-09 21:01:28
Please participate in the beta and you will be privy to the exciting new features that Bitcoinaverage has. They are on the cutting edge of new technology to provide the best data available and more accurate than any other index
@_date: 2016-04-14 16:44:24
Perhaps someone from Changecoin can comment?
@_date: 2016-04-14 03:34:50
lol - please don't send it to this random address. there are no unlocking features by coin

Seriously though I stopped using ATMs and now work with local traders who I can meet in person or they interac transfer it to me - they're from the local Bitcoin meetup scene and legit folks not scammers 
@_date: 2015-06-03 06:58:09
I highly recommend you Do Not use Interac Email Transfer or PayPal if you're going to use Local Bitcoins. 
Reason is I lost 1500 to scammers on there as they accepted my offer to sell, my coins were locked in escrow on Local Bitcoins (shitty feature) and I received screen shots from the buyer. Looked legit, gave them my email and they sent the Interac transfer - waited 30 minutes, Interac was still deposited so I sent the coins. Couple hours later my bank account at TD was frozen, turns out the funds were stolen and TD can't do anything about it, I'm still out 1500.

they're using colored coins so it will still require miners fees. 
colored coins is just a protocol to the Bitcoin blockchain saying this transaction output has Label X which will follow those bitcoins with each subsequent transaction.

Hi, we have a couple questions for an upcoming article. going to send you a PM
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:47:47
R3 with Linux and IBM are working on permissioned ledger Blockchains  - essentially banks in a network need to transfer money between each other, they currently pay wire fees -
Using the Bitcoin Blockchain wouldn't necessarily be the right fit as these institutions would want to ensure they own the data and can manage access to the ledger.
Advantages of using the Blockchain:
They can use this for clearing and settling transfers/transactions between interbank networks.
They can use this to create clearing pools/houses.
They can also create fiat assets or securities on the Blockchain.
@_date: 2016-03-27 18:40:11
No they are not related.

It's better to have this off chain using something like the Lightening Network. Voting on the blockchain can be done it would just be seen as spam if there are lots of micro transactions clogging the network

and it backs up my point, have you considered that data is the hash? 
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:58:27
Did I say you were a poor representative of Armory? Did I say you were needing to be 'put out of your misery'? No. In fact, you instigated this turn of argument and continued to make offensive and personal attacks without justification. You still have not apologized and you have not retracted your comments, again your behavior is appalling. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:02:38
what were you arguing about again? Your argument is so diluted that it lacks merit. Factom only stores the hash, Entry Credits can store raw data that is readable - however this is not put into Factom Blocks. You misunderstand.
@_date: 2015-04-03 03:08:56
it doesnt store the raw data, only the hash of that data
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:35:12
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:30:33
Factom is only meant to store the hash, its not a data store. Not meant for pictures, not meant for human readable documents. That's what Storj does, do you understand now?
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:34:13
Exactly what lock-in situation with bitcoin are you referring to? 


This doesn't make sense, are you referring to the potential of a more efficient proof of work consensus system that would disrupt the current dynamic of Asic chips and pooled miners?


Any clone would not leverage the Factom network, and that is precisely what Factoids are used for. Security would not be identical because then you have the problem of embedding additional and unncessary meta-data into the Bitcoin Blockchain which is what Factom is solving with its system of Factom blocks. This is what gives Factom security.
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:53:22
- There are a few things wrong with the post linked here, it doesn't address the fundamental premise of Factom which is to create a data layer of chained hashes. 
- It cannot and should not be done with the Bitcoin Blockchain today, besides the 10 minute blocktimes and the restriction on data size - the blockchain itself is getting larger everyday. Factom actually alleviates the Bitcoin Blockchain from any potential project wanting to inject additional data just to prove its existence.
- Sidechains when released would serve as an intermediate chain if 2way pegged, and Factom in theory would be able to peg itself to a sidechain
- Appcoins are a terrible name and not an accurate descriptor of the network token referenced here. Factoids serve the network to prevent spam, would you call ETH an appcoin? Just like ETH is to Ethereum, Factoids are to Factom. Neither of them are 'Appcoins'
@_date: 2015-04-10 18:01:44
sigh you don't understand - Entry credits are not put into Factom blocks unless they are hashed by Factoids.
@_date: 2015-04-03 03:33:58
this isnt accurate, the XRP listed on Bitstamp is being held because the person that is trying to sell it - isn't legally allowed to do so.

@_date: 2015-04-02 02:13:17

 &gt; -it's hard to call something a scam when you are  being given information on what it is you are receiving in exchange for your purchase, which in this case are Factoids

you were incredibly rude and offensive. you have yet to apologize and retract your statements, do you understand?  
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:59:50
Congrats Jacob! 
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:44:39
Factom does not store readable data, it does not store pictures. It stores a hash, you fail to understand. Factom is not Storj.
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:14:37
you try personal attacks to further your point, have I attacked you or said anything offensive? No.
@_date: 2015-04-03 00:49:36
because it doesn't store any data, only the hash
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:36:30
1. Merkle trees using Op_return may be suitable for some, but the limitations of blocktime, blocksize still apply. The cost of data storage is relative - if you're hashing a song, or an article that's one thing, but for Enterprise plays which is what Factom is doing - they need a chain of hashes, created off-chain and they would be willing to pay more for that.
2. Sidechains will use atomic swaps and alt-chains would be able to use a 2 way peg. Any altcoin, altchain would be able to implement this to peg itself to a sidechain.
3. Appcoins describe an application leveraging a coin. Factom is a platform, not an application - Factoids are useful to business processes, not particularly end users who consume applications. An example is IMAP (protocol) and Hotmail (application).
4. Ethereum has stated that they are building a platform, they're not focused on features see: 
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:52:50
As you have requested, page 14:
 "Entries can [be] plain text if encoding or obscuring the data isn't necessary. By recording a hash of the document, Factom can provide basic proof of publication. Presenting the document at a later time, allows one to create its hash and compare it to the hash recorded in the past."


Page 19: 
"The right to put Entries into Factom is represented by Entry Credits. Factom seperates the two value-holding mechanisms, as they serve different purposes. Factoids can be converted into Entry Credits but not vice versa."
Do you understand now?
The image you references on Page 14 outlines that Entry Credits are hashed. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:11:19
Jimmy, your actions today paint a very clear picture of your agenda and your issues are with Factom - not me. I invited you to have a discussion and you preferred to take it to reddit. That was your choice, you've been wrong in your approach and wrong in your behavior. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 18:04:15
Entry credits can store anything, but Entry credits are not put into Factom blocks. Again you are misunderstanding that Factoids are required to convert Entry Credits, and these are then hashed into Factom. Factom only stores the hash. 
You seem very stubborn and this is no longer an intellectual argument but you're trying to prove that Factom is storing readable data? I'm not sure why.
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:19:40
You take things out of context and you misunderstand what is happening here. You involved Justus and made offensive comments with him tagged in them, it was really all your fault. Learn how to conduct yourself properly and maybe you'll have something really valuable to share.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:15:24
As someone who is involved with advising on this project, I'm well aware of what the whitepaper says. And Factom is not a data store, it only keeps the hash of the data.
With all due respect, have you considered that you haven't read the whitepaper correctly?
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:53:29
Read the comment again, Paul Snow said you don't understand how Entry Credits work. And its only the Entry Credits that store readable data. You don't seem to understand what you're reading.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:31:56
you're misinterpreting Paul's comments - inserting a photo is the encoding process of creating a hash, which is sent to the Factom blocks.
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:13:08
Nice! I use One Hash for my sports betting!
@_date: 2015-04-03 00:46:29
1. We're talking about Factom offering a data layer seperate from the Bitcoin Blockchain, its advantage as an audit trail and notary system is valuable to those who require their own chain of hashed documents. Disaster recovery, incremental back ups are not applicable when we are talking Blockchain platforms.
2. A sidechain that is 2 way peg or even a 1 way peg does not derive value from Bitcoin. The atomic swap that occurs between the sidechain and the Bitcoin Blockchain is an exchange, Bitcoins value will remain within Bitcoin's Blockchain. Factoids are created separately from Bitcoin, these transactions do form a chain of its own - and they are useful because the Factom network only uses Factoids. 
3.  For an application, the customer is the end user, or the buyer.
 - For the platform, it's the software developer whose problem you're solving. So, go talk to them. Understand what developers will pay for, or what will encourage them to build their applications in such a way that they have a technology dependency on you, then figure out how to extract value from it.
4. Ethereum is not an application, and neither is Factom.
I haven't invested in Factom, but I am an advisor. And if this is an economic argument, then I welcome economic perspectives.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:24:23
do you actually think that factom is storing pictures or human readable documents? If so, I invite you to a discussion off reddit, as clearly there is a misinterpretation of facts.
