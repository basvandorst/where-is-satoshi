Oooooooohhhhhhh I never thought about that.... 
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:01:27
No no no. I know that, man. I'm saying if there was a line, surely people would leave after so long of waiting for a currency transfer. You know? I'm just curious as to if it's Apple/Android Pay or Something similar

Every single time I did it, it worked. Don't let one Shitty vendor(or custom officials) discourage you, Bro.

Definitely Send Me A Couple, As A Uhhh Investment�� Jk m8. Good On Ya! Similar situation almost happened to me awhile ago, But I'd Sell Probably A 1/4 of It, and Hold The Rest for The Future.

Yeee Yeeeee! There's Also A Few Out Here in AZ. They're Almost ALL At Headshops, or Vape Shops tho.

Man, I am broker than brokeback Mountain, ain't even gotta Mountain. I used to mess with BTC back in the day, when it first came out and it was like $12 for 1 whole BTC. Locked it into a wallet I thought was safe, had 4 left. 3yrs later(when it hit a high value of $1200)I tried to withdraw it only to find out the site was no more. So, I haven't really messed with it, since. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 08:54:12
That The whole reason I even got into BTC in the 1st place, honestly. 
And partly why I think their value continues to go up and up. Drugs are extremely pricey(not weed) but I sincerely think that drugs and the whole dark net thing is what continues to help grow the BTC value, as well. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:42:44
Some of us are too broke to afford to buy bitcoin and actually use it practically where we're located. Simple question, and yet no answer. Sheesh. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 18:50:57
Curious as to how fast the transaction is, and how you would actually process that as its not like BTC is on A Debit Card or Physical Currency(not much anymore, Anyways) 
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:15:26
Guys all I'm asking is what transfer program(if any) are being used. I don't have to be lectured on the greatness that is BTC. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:17:31
*'On The eBay'*
Lol can't stop giggling
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:13:48
Uhmmm.....Explain by what you mean? 
All of my transactions were from BitInstant to my block chain wallet, and then into my SR Account. 
I had bought loads of BTC and spent them on SR and by the time they reached a high of $60 things weren't going great for me, financially speaking. But I really wish that I had, and kept them. I had no idea at the time just how big of an impact BTC would make on the world as a whole. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 08:08:10
Jfc that's expensive. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:49:50
No, what I was trying to imply was that it wasn't my main wallet for storing BTC. Besides, I don't do drugs anymore. And I mainly used it as a means of getting hard/hard to find drugs when I was about 15/16. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:05:22
Black market wallet that I stored them in, instead of transferring them out because you needed to have a specific amount to transfer them in/out, and It was leftover after spending what I had. 
That site got shut down and all BTC in wallets were seized by the US government. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 00:27:30
This is 100% true. The reason that I think, is because Opiate users most likely already have a connection, and Also, they ain't got time to wait for that Shit. Plus Psychedelics are hard to find for the average person(or at least they were about 8yrs ago) 
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:25:39
Yknow, it *is* possible to hack BTC accounts and steal it from people.....The government could've just as easily done that, too. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:12:04
Oh Ffs I'm not going to explain how a Wallet on A different site works. 
I transferred it to a wallet. A specific 256-bit string that had an entire set up. 
The point is, That site has SINCE Been shut down and all of the BTC seized, or otherwise, unattainable due to government activity. Idk what's so hard to understand about that. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 03:46:51
Well, yeah....My only gripe is that I can find high quality LSD and they *do* store it great. Also hadda guy who grew fungus for awhile&amp;Extracted Deemster, But yeah. That took me a long time for these connects.
However, Good Cocaine is hard to find anywhere nowadays, and most people just buy Meth as it's stronger and longer lasting of a high. 
But when I first started using the darknet, I was in high school or just graduated, and I used it to either make money from people who couldn't find Psychedelics, fake ID's(for buying alcohol under age) and Getting free samples of Opioids. But yeah, most street dealers sell Opioids, Stimulants, Benzo's, and Weed. Those are the main drugs you can find everywhere, and like we both said, no Addict is gonna wait to get his dope when he could just drive to his homeboys house and get high right then and there. 
I actually used to get 200g's of MDMA Shipped in from Amsterdam on the *Weekly* and made a killing doing this years ago, right as the big Molly craze started going on. Sold from Washington all the way down to AZ and man, that Shit was fire.....Then my connect got arrested....Sad, Sad day... 
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:26:28
It definitely was my private key. The thing was kinda similar how mtgox fooled a bunch of their users and just stole them from out from under them and closed shop. 
This was the original silk road. The true dread Pirate Robert. He was fully invested in BTC as a viable and open market currency. I understand what you're saying, but I don't think I'm able to fully explain the logistics. And Tbh I might have left them in my wallet to use at a later date or something and just forgot about them. I honestly can't remember. This was a long time ago. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:23:15
I had at least 20BTC when they were $12 a piece....Man, if my wallet hadn't been seized, I'd still have them. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:16:02
Sure. 
Regardless of What you *think* you know, you should still be more polite, and possibly more informative. You know, rather than just repeating the same thing over and over. 
So tell me, if I have my private key, how *would* I go about withdrawing them from a wallet/site that *no longer exists* sir. Please tell me. I'd actually very much appreciate it, if you're able to. Because then maybe I can get them back into a normal blockchain/BTC wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:16:42
You mean wasn't actually my *wallet* correct. It was a temporary holding spot, that was a wallet, that I could've potentially transferred out of if that site would have remained up, and they'd of still been my funds. 
So, I mean. I paid for the BTC. I transferred them to another account located on a website. Why wouldn't it be mine? 
@_date: 2018-12-24 23:37:46
I remember a long time ago(think 2010 or something) that they were thinking about releasing a physical bitcoin into the wild, and that it's price would fluxuate the same as digital BTC. Something similar to that affect. However, I could just be remembering it wrong altogether. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:09:24
This needs to be more widespread information. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:17:11
That Site does not *Exist* Anymore. It is gone. Done. 
Here's a link to silk road 2.0 when IT got shut down. The *exact same thing* happened to the 1st SR. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:51:54
That's the thing though. It was my key. Idk How much further I can explain that. Do you guys just not know about what the government did?....
@_date: 2018-12-23 00:18:28
Just to clear the air. I do understand what you're saying about them not being *my keys*. I totally get that. It'd be like having that wallet on a loan, or even a lien. Doesn't mean it's yours, just that you're using it for the time being. 
Now, a key looks like what exactly? There's so many different methods of security, and it's been a long time since iv is actually used BTC or even logged into a wallet. There's the 12 word passphrase of Random words, but what exactly does a key look like? Is it similar to a PGP Key for PGP Encryption? Orrr? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:03:24
Are you kidding me? The best time to buy btc was 2012. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:18:01
Yeah I bought in the year 2012. Lol.....I wish I could buy them for that cheap now.
