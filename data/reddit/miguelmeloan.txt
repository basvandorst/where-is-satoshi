I’m reading a possible slide to 5800... as someone said earlier, it is a good opportunity to buy in. Clearly this ETF business has a monumental impact. If a delay causes a drop like this, imagine what an approval would do?

Was hoping to see approval by inaction due to the shutdown

The rule change would have permitted them to list shares of the bitcoin ETF. I don’t view it as misleading at all as the two are being stated synonymously. Minds can differ though

What a joke. The SEC is concerned about price manipulation? Yet they release this decision the day before futures expire!? You’ve got to be kidding me.

The movement in the past two days hasn’t really been significant enough to hurt you that much, has it? Let’s recap it was 5,900... went to what, 6,600? Now it’s 6,500 and you’re going apocalyptic. You know how this market works right? You’re certainly entitled to your opinion but it’s a bit early to get all  Mayan calendar Holmes

Ageee with last response. Whether it is new age or dinosaur there needs to be something familiar to promote acceptance. Well done my dude!

You missed the point. The decision brings with it FUD and it was conveniently released the day before bitcoin futures expire, thus compounding the FUD. Intentionally or otherwise, this has resulted in defacto market manipulation, hence the current dip.
