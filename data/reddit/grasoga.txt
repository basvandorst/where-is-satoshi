I'm about ready to just close out bitcoin in my life.  HODL on to my holdings but I just need to get away from it and check it in a year.  If my money is evaporated a year from now I don't care.  If things grew that's great too.  I can't keep playing this game, it's too emotional!

True statement
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:28:36
 What does this mean in lay terms?  You think BTC will dip to 8k in next couple days or go up?

LOL laughed so hard.  I literally immediately thought the same thing.

They state on their website that "Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves. So 1 USD₮ is always equivalent to 1 USD."  Whether that's a true statement or not could be debated.  My point is everyone keeps stating they "make up money", which is a direct contradiction to what they've stated and there has been zero evidence presented that it's true.  At least have the intellectual honesty to state it is your own conspiracy theory, rather than just state things like they are facts when there is no back-up.  The truth is Tether is no different than any other alt coin or bitcoin for that matter.  Even if they DIDN'T back up each tether with traditional currency, it still has the value it has because others have bought into it.  Those that use it don't expect to go and trade it in for USD.  They would convert to BTC and then to USD like any other alt coin.  These people understand the way it works, and are ok with it's value being tethered to the dollar.  It's no more or less risky on an inherent level than any other alt coin, as in "I'm paying you actual dollars in exchange for 1's &amp; 0's in a computer screen".  Now, if you do have proof or someone else does that something fishy is going on, I would like to hear about it.

Noob Question:  how do the devs that work on Bitcoin get chosen, are they paid, and if so how are they paid and who determines how much they are paid?

Where is your proof the 1.6B was “made up”?  Everyone likes to repeat this rumor but I haven’t seen any evidence?

Exactly. Why the fuck wouldn’t he just pay them in BTC. Foolish fuck

The true value of a coin is market cap, not price per coin.  As soon as the shitcoin prints 3 trillion shitcoins the price of that coin, and thus the market cap of that coin would immediately fall to zero.  Nobody would be willing to buy one more coin for the $1 price, or even $0.01

Every time somebody says this it forebodes an imminent decline.  Don't jinx it!

Your statement is true, however, I think it is a relevant stat.  The reason is because as new and old investors enter this market they are continually looking for the next big thing to get those big returns.  With the alt market growing relative to Bitcoin, that is a lot of money that used to and/or would have been flowing right to bitcoin, fueling it's growth, but instead it is flowing to smaller alt coins.  The effect is Bitcoin's potential for growth is reduced overall.  That doesn't mean the trend couldn't reverse (it did this past summer!).  But I do think it is a relevant stat to keep an eye on.  However, I will say that just because that number is "low" doesn't mean it's going to go lower.  That makes no sense.  If anything, it may mean Bitcoin is primed to explode again and the money could all go flowing back to the mother ship!  I hope so.

why do you think it's bottom?
