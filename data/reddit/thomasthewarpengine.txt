Being naive and fully trusting someone that is a horrible person, but that you think rainbows and butterflies fall from their anus, is a thing. Been there, done that, still have some debt from it.

And yet he brings up valid points that haven't been refuted.

Taxation is motherfucking theft.
Small, accountable government can still plan the roads, but private companies are still contracted to build them.
These endless, illegal wars are costing billions and everyone thinks it's the norm.
Taking the fruit of ones labor without their consent, under threat of force, is theft. If you don't pay them, they lock your ass in a cell. It's thievery.
Government needs to be trimmed down. Wars need to be ended. The US spends more than the next 4 countries on "defense" combined!
But ok... I'm the delusional one.

And I hope everyone will follow that which has to suffer now, in the past or in the future to the same seizures! No matter in what crypto you are!
WE ARE CRYPTO! I believe in a future, which is maybe under the radar of GOV, where everything will be done/paid in cryptos.
That was the most Libertarian/American thing I've read all day, OP.
