Good post. I was considering contributing in some way but was thinking too difficult. This is easy and will certainly help. I will also talk to my friends. Thanks!

burn-rate = bit-inch per fortnight?

sorry, if we're going that way, it would have to be 'intergalactic credits'....

fees are not related to the transaction amount but to the number of bytes the transaction takes up in the block. So you COULD have paid 0.0000001% transaction fees, if the number of BTC were high enough and the input and output count were low. OTOH you can pay &gt;100% fees if you send a load of dust utxo's to a new tx.

"Shady Past" in the same sense that Voldemort occasionally has a bit of a temper eh? But even so, megaupload2 will fail anyway, KimBlobCom is not someone to be taken seriously.

Oh come on. Kim Schmitz is a convicted scammer and criminal. Kimvestor was a ponzi scheme, megaupload a rippoff and his letsbuyit period was fueled with lawsuits and riddled with get-rich-quick schemes.  That he succeeded is 100% down to street-smart, unethical and criminal behaviour. The man is no entrepreneur, he is Kim Blob Com.

Misleading title: he is talking about liquid, not lightning. Learn to read....
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:50:08
No, actually, he clarified that he was talking about a side chain, Liquid is mentioned specifically. At no point is he claiming that BS is asking 5K to access Lightning. That would also be impossible btw. So: Title should read: "Lead Openbazaar dev telling BTC users that Blockstream charges $5000 per user to use Liquid sidechain". (I wouldn't consider Lightning a sidechain anyway)
