Assuming something similar to a Bear Sterns unfolded...
Crypto markets would crash instantly as all the big money in over-extended and leveraged positions would seek an exit. Panic would set in... BTC drop to $800 before recovering back to $2500 in space of a couple of weeks. Then the rebuilding would begin.
But who knows? This is why practical user adoption is important if BTC et al are to survive a serious market incident.

Given the dates you mentioned, you also have Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold you can claim from that wallet.

Putting private keys in will is technically poor opsec. Legally, it would be OK as executor of will is "responsible", but if private keys were compromised, how could it be proved/traced? Difficult!
As such, rather than listing keys in will, provide access to keys via intermediary (bank / vault / etc).

Not everyone involved in the crypto space is focused on maximizing $USD returns in the short term. I think the twins have demonstrated that they are in it for the long haul.

I've been doing some research into this and generally there is no formal process to properly manage death and transfer of assets. That's not to say that exchanges won't assist, it's just it will be difficult. It's something which will become a bigger issues in years to come.
For now... 
* keep majority of your crypto off exchanges
* write down private keys and store in secure location (vault, under mattress, etc)
* draw up a will with instructions on how beneficiaries of will can access private keys
It's something I've considered recently as I have crypto assets that my friends/family know nothing of. Yet if I were to die, I'd want that value to be passed to family/friends/causes. Forced me to draw up will and setup secure reclaim for family, etc.
Are you familiar with multi-sig? Another option to consider.

Is it silly to censor In some ways yes, the answer to your question is obvious. Let's just explore ideas and let the best ideas win.
But when the value of having the accepted "best" idea is literally worth billions of dollars and holds the ability to shake and shape the world, controlling the narrative becomes very valuable.
That's what you are seeing play out in these forums and subreddits.

Agree 100%
Bridgewater aims to be right about which way the river is flowing. Yet Bridgewater is not actively involved in determining and shaping the slope of the mountain.
Bitcoin is still in the early exploration and cartography phase.

I don't think any truly honest rational side of any argument in this debate would say the way forward is obvious. We are chaos theory in action.
Allowing "bad" inputs into the system poses the risk of polluting the "outputs" of the system. Explains censorship but doesn't justify it.
