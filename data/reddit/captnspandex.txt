Take a look at the FAQ and other info on the sidebar. It's a terrific intro. You might also want to take a look at I agree with the other commenter, though -- don't bother mining! It's far more effective to buy some coin directly.

That's a good lesson to learn for only $5.
Bitcoin is like any other investment: don't put in more than you're willing to lose.

No, I'm the internet's biggest faggot. You're just classless.

Go ahead and join a pool for a while, using whatever you've currently got for mining, and the economics will immediately become clear to you.  You'll mine for days and days and days and reap Bitcoin worth about pennies in $USD.  
Just yesterday someone posted about spending $60 for two hours' worth of time on a 240 GH/s miner, and he came away with almost nothing for his trouble.
If the coins continue to increase in value, as you suggest, it's still a better idea to just buy them instead of mine them.
Would you rather spend $5000+ on a good rig, and never make your money back on it, OR spend $5000+ on Bitcoin?  Just buy the coin.

I'm sure I know the answer to this question, but did you have two-factor authentication enabled?
Consider it a hard lesson, and then turn it on. Even then, never keep your coin in a wallet you don't control unless you're about to use it.

90% of the volume on ForEx markets is speculation.
