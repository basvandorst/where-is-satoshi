But they forget that bad things will happen to them if the world declines into misery and chaos. 
A poor person watching their grandparents or elderly neighbors not be able to afford cat food for dinner will be angry and resentful. 
Wealth might get redistributed by force.

God this makes me mad: "Hackers are illegally generating Monero, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ...raising questions about the security of one of the fastest-growing corners of financial markets."
"illicit cryptocurrency mining -- the digital equivalent of minting money "
This really ready like counterfeiting is happening.

I personally feel the same way. Long ago when Soylent had just come out they accepted BTC and I just loved paying that way. 
Funny thing was that they had so many orders (from credit cards mostly I bet) that they got backordered so I ended up getting a refund in BTC. I looked at what I spent for the 1 week supply in BTC recently and it'd be like 3k in todays money. Really glad I got that refund!

Honest question: A friend is launching a ebike product (scooter, bikes, kick bikes...) after 4+ years of development. 
He doesn't have any personal connection to crypto as he eat sleeps and breaths ebike. I'd like him to take BTC/ETH but the learning curve, the complications for taxes, and converting what he'd need to fiat for supply chain makes giving 15% off seem a hard sell. Is 5% enough that people would think it's reasonable? 
He hopes to launch within the next 5 days or so and I'm hounding him.  Appreciate any thoughts.

This happened to me years ago. Was $2500 and left untended for years as we moved to NY from PA and just let it sit. When we tried to get it they had changed the name of the bank, had no record, and said something about inactivity.
I'm sure custodial services will reproduce this kind of bullshit if they can. 
Keys for all.

I like that BTC is less expensive than CC for this exchange. But that BTC is more than $ means (i think) that they're just converting it right away and sending to some $$ account.
