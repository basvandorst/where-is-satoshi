I would disagree with you on the USD  losing "value".  Actually, the opposite has happened. It's actually gaining value.  Simply look at current inflation rates in the face of the massive QE printing sprees over the past 9 years. The fed is ATTEMPTING to get to their 2% core rate, and they can't even reach it.  There is a present consensus that they will need to lower rates again. People argued that QE  would cause hyperinflation - but in fact.. the opposite happened.  The reason for is fairly complex - but is outlined in the "dollar milkshake theory".  In summary -  the USD remains the worlds reserve currency due to our economy.  When times are tough.. ppl want to own dollars.  And the great illusion is that when the biggest economy overprints, it destroys its value. As long as the US is the  economy, we can essentially print as much as needed regulate our markets - also thereby inflating markets.
When fed's of the **WORLD** work in sequence to print money - something that was **NOT** an accident.. money flows back into USD.  **LIQUID** forex markets **can't work** if there is **one currency to rule them all** scenario described by Bitcoin uber bulls.  I understand that there is NO PAIR for Bitcoin - and this is the biggest issue as a potential currency, in addition to volatility etc.
We have reserve currencies like the **USD, Yen, and Pound** working in sequence for a reason.  Without a legitimate **pair** for bitcoin, and without competitive coins with equal reserve power.. the currency argument is dead. The store of value argument makes some sense..and is the reason I believe it could work.  But then again - a store of value as % of what? Bitcoin as a % of ether.. there has to be some legitimate value reference.
Clearly, we all understand that the US Govt. and treasury are separate institutions - and work "independently".. but ultimately the fed is an institution of the US Govt. Without one there really is no other.  So when I say a gov't backed crypto of the future - it's fine to say a Fed Dollar or something of the sort.. it makes no difference.  All that matters is - will the Feds issue their own crypto on the gold standard, and if this happens.. how would this effect bitcoin.
  
Side Note: I think I've answered my own question - fiat currency will continue to flourish.  If you'd like to go store value digitally - buy bitcoin, gold etf or something of the sort.  If you'd like the speculate on gold being replaced by bitcoin as the de facto store of value for all govts. and persons.. then you're a bitcoin bull and the value should be much higher.  If you think the ease of crypto creation hinders bitcoins credibility as a storage of value vs gold - then don't buy

The running independent to anything is a farce.. it’s running up in value as a speciation tool solely based on it’s fiat value - nothing else.  It’s utility as a blockchain has already been surpassed by competing coins.  It’s simply trusted - the same way USD is trusted, and is why it remains and will likely will remain on top.. 
That is until govts issue their own currencies backed by something which is arguably a better store of value, and is finite in nature as well...gold.

My only point is that you can’t run a legitimate business with a “currency” like bitcoin - it’s entirely too volatile.  It’s only use case is store of value.

I mean I guess.. but they aren’t really accepting bitcoin. They’re never touch any bitcoin.  They use a 3rd party service to convert bit to USD before the transaction is finalized.  Lots of watch dealers offer the same service.

You realize it’s being converted to USD immediately.. right?

I am referring to the economic barriers to entry, not physically stealing Bitcoins.  What that means is anyone can create another crypto currency like Bitcoin.  Currently Bitcoin has remained the premier option because you can buy other cryptos with Bitcoin, and it was the first mover.  But as you have seen with Ether.. there is always something newer, better, or improved.  
Because BC is being used to store value like gold, versus like a traditional currency to exhange for goods/ services currently, it's a value storage play.  Just like gold - there's a finite amount of it
Additionally - my comment on the fed was simply to state that they help in protecting the value of a currency like the USD by regulating int. rates as an third party.  Their purpose to to avoid bubbles, something I feel might be an issue with an independent currency like BC that's not being used to buy goods by any large scale.
