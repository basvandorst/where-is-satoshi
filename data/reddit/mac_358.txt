You are spot on they have protected themselves through anonymity,
Email and whois data is protected by  [domains-anonymizer]( based in Panama
And the hosted site is provided by cloudflare in the US - [104.16.0.0/12]( so a federal crime has been committed.
I doubt they have any ties to Singapore this is most likely just deflection.

Hi, 
Did you manage to get anywhere?
I kind of have a different approach, as i can't believe that after all this time the site is still operational and they are still managing to scam people (this i see through other projects helping give them legitimacy)
Here's my approach, the site is hosted is the US so i have already reported via the abuse mechanism, could do with a US citizen reporting to the authorities.
BiteBTC have covered their tracks well, but they have promoters and business associates, some projects that actively defend them and refuse to accept that any wrong is been done irregardless of the evidence, one such project is Rapids RPD, this is where I saw the promotion and got scammed trying to procure RPD for a Master Node, now they have actively done business with them and have contact information, this would no doubt help any authority find the real perpetrators, besides if they refuse to accept a crime has been committed and defend and promote knowing crimes have been committed and further crime will be committed they are guilty also, and should be presented to any authorities in a complaint, maybe the weakest ling in locating them.
This site needs to be tore down, and the perpetrators stopped!!
I Have accepted my losses and will learn from my mistakes, but it makes me sick to think that they still prosper from other innocents and people actively help them to carry out further theft.
