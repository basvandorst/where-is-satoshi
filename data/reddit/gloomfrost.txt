I agree a 'stamp of approval' is necessary - but you can't just write off new websites that aren't launched by andreas.. Where's the innovative spirit? Ideally something that has a good business model with a good history of proper management and significant time investment by its owners to create a good service would be enough for me.

@_date: 2014-01-03 10:03:08
I have and I don't get 2 things:
1. When/how does the protocol get updated, what if a major player wants to adopt bitcoin tomorrow and start generating 300 tpm for example.. There's no 'bitcoin protocol tech support', so that player's payment processing choice will be dead in the water and create doubt in the 'flexibility' of the network. Even if they don't continuously generate 300tpm, if they generate a 'burst' of quick transactions, wouldn't that bog down the network and delay everyone elses payments?
2. The biggest issue I see is block size. This affects both the transmission speed and storage for anyone who wants to run the qt client and store the whole blockchain or similar. 7.8mbit as quoted in that article is NOT that low, that's higher than what I had here in my metropolitan area 3 years ago. I wager most people are on speeds lower than this. They wouldn't be able to keep up with the network at all!
@_date: 2014-07-25 07:22:22
Good luck with this Chris. One problem is that some 'hardcore bitcoin evangelists' may be 16yr olds outside of the U.S. and the most they FEEL they can do is say 'fuck off' via a reddit comment (unfortunately). I would recommend a step by step process/tutorial for anyone and everyone to do your items (a) through (c). People here are pretty good (and like) following tutorials after all. Give them the ~~tools~~ weapons they need. 
Oh and forget about Lawsky, it's not HIM, I wouldn't be surprised if he's totally pro-bitcoin but his supervisor told him he'd lose his job if he continued to interact with the bitcoin community in the way he did. Keep the organization accountable, not him personally.

1. I'm not affiliated with any site though I've used all of them and have provided feedback on all, including bb.
2. I don't think anyone would care to actively shit on bb since they're already pretty shit: see thread here
3. If you're honestly going to compare bm to bb and think bb is some somehow superior then that's pretty mental. Again, see thread here. Fairlay, predictious and bm are all far superior to bb in every way, bm is just a direct successor since they're the only ones that use parimutuel out of the 3 mentioned

What do you mean "permission"? To operate the site, or to create predictions like your Japan bombing on? I'm pretty sure you can make that prediction on the markets. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 05:38:48
Not even close. You'll see what I mean soon enough! :) There are numerous other examples of bitcoin sites that can't really work with real money. Gambling and gaming sites for example, in general are very accessible with bitcoin as opposed to credit cards. Any site where you have a potential to lose something soon after registration are exposed to consumers playing the fraud thing and the operators are often held liable for it. Not so with bitcoin! I think any type of gambling (even pseudo-gambling like prediction sites) will see big innovations with the help of bitcoin.

Not good. To anyone looking for alternatives, I recommend BetMoose ( which has a distributed resolution system where the site owners aren't part of the resolution equation. 
P.S: I called fairlay out on this like 3 months ago. BitBet is also prone to this btw.

You should actually read some of those ongoing discussions, AP is not bad for bitcoin. Paying with your phone is still a novel concept to most and Apple is holding people's hands on the transition. It'll be much easier to understand paying with bitcoin once people have been paying with ApplePay for awhile.

FYI to anyone who is unfamiliar with parimutuel betting, this is very likely the same person as the one who placed the 1000 on Yes earlier trying to reduce his expected loss. Aka the site owner who made a terrible bet and is trying to salvage it.
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:25:56
I suppose, but there's an issue with "what happens if I lose my phone?"
To which we have
a) use a web wallet (big no-no in bitcoin)
b) backup wallet to offline source, encrypt it (not user-friendly)
c) something like a and b with blockchain.info
Am I missing anything?

I don't think this will be possible any time soon, if ever, with 'smart' contracts. You realize someone has to manually program in something that automatically KNOWS whether or not your AT&amp;T account was actually transferred or not. I doubt AT&amp;T would make that information public. Hence, unlikely that it'll be done via smart-contracts. Sorry to burst your bubble. 
Use an escrow, or do it in real-time with the guy while 3-way calling AT&amp;T.

Are you shorting your BTC then?
@_date: 2014-09-21 07:25:11
I said this in the last thread, but the 2 massive 1000 bets are from the site owner, mircea pompescu. The first one a dumb bet in itself, the second was to try and claw back the losses. In any case it's pretty sad that there's only 200 or so bets on this, even with such a massive pot. This is probably because the site is incredibly sketchy and that mp can easily take it down if he loses that much since those losses alone are more than the site is worth. Consider yourself warned and never send funds to a site that isn't using SSL. 
Edit: Or someone you don't trust.
@_date: 2014-06-04 05:45:45
We really need more threads like this on here. I like your thinking, not sure the outcome. I think it would easily become 2nd but NOT first mainly because the media (and hence the 'mainstream' thing) would relate it/compare it to bitcoin and everyone would call it 'google's own bitcoin'. Also, Google launching its own coin will be great for bitcoin as Google will take on all the regulatory burdens, thus reducing regulation uncertainty for bitcoin. Lastly, bitcoin becomes more fungible as there's no reason why google WOULDN'T accept bitcoin if they have the tech for their own coin. If anything, google would want to eat up bitcoin to take over the world with their own google coin.
Anyway, Just my 0.02 BTC.

@_date: 2014-06-24 04:09:43
That's the best part though - since this is a new pool inside a derivative contract, one of those 3 options will definitely win - so your odds are vastly improved and since you can see everyone else's bet, as well as the total pool, you know exactly how much you will win. That's why I thought it was cool.

Because like ~97% of bitcoiners are hodling it like gold instead of using it as a currency. After all, why not? Bitcoin's current value is in hopes of future appreciation, at least until we get proper remittance services and larger gambling operators and underground markets using it (which are the largest realistic markets for bitcoin). I don't think 'buying groceries' with it will happen anytime soon, nor would anyone care to use it to buy groceries in order to have to login to their exchange accounts to buy more at a premium...

I'm surprised no one has said this yet - you can use Bitcoin within apps/websites that could NOT have been done (or work) with traditional payment methods. Example: I'm helping beta test a stealth project - a social prediction market that will be launching next month probably and their model would not work with credit cards. Or, if it did, they'd have to spend thousands getting regulated and building out the infrastructure. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 03:00:10

@_date: 2014-11-07 23:59:38


Not necessarily. Example: BetMoose operates what they call a "distributed" resolution model which means the authors resolve their own bets/predictions. Not sure if they've been threatened by authorities but I would imagine it wouldn't be that different than people selling drugs on facebook - it's the person selling the drugs that would get in trouble, not facebook itself, which clearly has a legal purpose. Decentralization doesn't necessarily prevent this issue either, vendors on SR and SR2.0 were still found out and convicted.

Yup. You and I know this but too many people are still on WEP, default-pass WPA, and crappy-pass WPA. Oh and I forgot to mention, many new routers ship with WPS, which is vulnerable (can be cracked in about 6-12 hours without anyone even at home using the network). So not only do we need to tell people to set a strong, unique, non-dictionary WPA pass (no one wants to use &amp;27hw2 as a WPA paskey), but teach them to go to 192.168.0/1.1 and turn off WPS manually, which is in itself something that hopes to ween people off of passkeys.. *le sigh*

They're both 'truly' P2P because it allows 'peer' bet creations and p2p matching of bets. That said, yes betmoose is centralized.. not sure if that's a bad thing here though; their fees are 3% that are split between hosts, it'll be hard to do better than that with a multi-oracle setup in a decentralized environment. Issue here is paying those oracles fairly, especially when the resolutions may be a topic they don't know about... dunno if the world is even ready for that many contracts that need to be resolved in the first place. Will be more necessary when DACs come around. Still, add me to the watchlist!

I DO use BetMoose (under the same username), just like I use predictious and bitbet to better spread volume. I never said I didn't. That first post you linked I didn't appreciate being removed as I believe it was my first share of a BetMoose bet I created, and it was quite relevant, (and the related response in the second post). I'm not defending BetMoose btw, I'm defending reddit, don't double post as it's against the rules. Fyi there's a user, anon152636 (some random numbers, not that combo) that shares BetMoose bets on here all the time (which is OKAY btw) BUT if I see the same bet twice I report it.  Sharing once is okay, sharing twice is not. I'm on mobile but chances are this post was shadow removed (no activity) so looks like the mods agree.
I legitimately don't understand what the graphs mean or which one I should be looking at, are they all equally interesting? Why? What do the yellow and blue dots mean? That's what I mean by 'out of context'
@_date: 2014-07-17 05:05:15
It's better cause there's a deadline and the odds it will/will not happen will naturally change over time so what you lock into now may not actually be efficient. But if you add weight with a time multiplier you're guaranteed a better return than anyone else who bets after you on the same outcome (assuming you're correct). Also if Bitcoin is gone by tomorrow you can still salvage it by putting something on the other side but with fixed odds you can't...

Very difficult to decentralize anything with human involvement unfortunately. At some point during a human-mediation, you run in all sorts of biases, corruption, collusion, incentive issues, etc etc. And even semi-decentralized schemed proposed thus far have been pretty scary to say the least.

It's not a 'he', it's a full team with investor backing. And I helped alpha-test an automated proof-of-reserves tool they have, which is superb. I rather trust BetMoose because I know the host of the bet is the one resolving it (and if they attempt to do something bad, BetMoose mods will take care of it). Whereas with Xbet, I'm trusting complete strangers and their knowledge (or lack thereof) on a very bland cookie-cutter website.
Consider how many more millions of $USD worth of bitcoins are being held by bitcoin sportsbooks; there's a reason for that.

I'm thinking of 2 examples here.. let's say I want to buy a house TODAY, and I have $100k, but the house costs $400k. I pay $100k and take out a loan against my future earnings I make at my company. Wouldn't bitcoin limit me from doing that? 
OR, say I BOUGHT a house but now have $0 in my bank account, I wouldn't be too worried about having a financial buffer because I have a stable salary so if my credit card has a $10,000 limit, that IS my buffer... How could this work under bitcoin? Extending credit would be ridiculously expensive because defaults would affect my bottom line directly since the government wouldn't cover any bankruptcy filings.

Copy pasta from my comment on there:
This author misses a critical point - Bitcoin and bitcoins are two different things. You invest into Bitcoin by buying bitcoins, they are two very different things. Think paper/derivative gold etfs. By buying shares you are not contributing to the value creation of gold, but rather speculating on the price. It's still an investment though because it's backed by gold.


Change "Great businesses" to "Great inventions" and you have Bitcoin.
When you "invest" in Bitcoin you are "buying pieces of great *inventions* that will objectively be worth more in the future than they are today".

You will never be able to fully close the loop as long as Bitcoin is considered an asset. One asset can always be exchanged for another. That's why some companies sell off their "uncollected debts" accounts to private companies who call you like crazy until you send the money you owe.

Yes but that's not a house edge. For example, if you dump 1000 BTC on both sides, your odds on both sides will increase significantly and you'll win your own coins back (aka what's going on in this bet now). Likewise, if anyone else bets against you your odds continue to increase as the other pot gets more saturated.

3. Meetup organizers to spread it on social media or how about some traditional flyers?
4. A purpose - how about "you may be having a nice christmas, but there are those that aren't - did you know you can send this bitcoin to X overseas charity instantly and it goes directly to the cause, without all the middlemen?"

My guess is you won't find a discount with using bitcoin, outside of buying gyft then buying something with that. Reason being is those codes have to come from somewhere and if it's an unused code, it has to come from the publisher. Any site that would resell these would have to charge a mark-up, not provide a discount, otherwise they won't make any money. I'm not sure if the publisher has bulk discounts on codes but eh, I'd suggest you stick with fiat here.
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:02:05
I know this is but in practical terms this isn't a big problem as you might think as long as it's a transparent trusted party. No one seems to be complaining about circle or coinbase, even though most likely they're holding a significant portion of all BTC and can in theory maliciously dump them or run away etc. Hell, ALL sports gambling with BTC (other than the XCP stuff) is centralized and it's working out fine. Why? Liquidity and accessibility. Fiat is working even better than BTC because people have it. That's why I originally said there's no real value of XCP for betting because you can do so easier and generally better (fully realized and developed platforms) on BTC getting the same benefits OTHER than the decentralization.

What you've just described is money laundering (illegal) and unfortunately prevents this from ever happening on a commercial scale. The person that will be required to convert your BTC to USD will require, at the governments request, to provide information of where the money came from.

@_date: 2014-06-21 00:32:34
Nothing, but it's not really a problem - in fact, this just shows the power of prediction markets. If he bets really high early on it, then it'll sorta seem odd/dissuade other bettors (as most hosts bet on both sides to add liquidity). If he bets a lot late, his weight will be low and the other bettors that got it right win more relatively. The winners are still the ones that bet on the correct outcome.

This is just incorrect logic. If you mean you will try and buy up bitcoin, good luck. Someone will still HODL until $1,000,000 per coin, so it'll get exponentially harder to buy, if not approach infinite cause some will HODL till death.
Also, so what? How much did all those miners cost? I doubt they were BILLIONS of dollars. If you're interested in spending billions, you can probably create your own blockchain with a stronger support than bitcoins, or just 51% bitcoin's (but then it'll be worthless). Pick your poison.

Still, I'd really like to see more bitcoin EXCHANGES - there was one I think last month that looked really promising, had a design similar to betfair. Forgot the name, but we need more of those. Overround is nice for the books, not for the players. I think Bitcoin and its global reach is perfect to take advantage of this. Instead, we have centralized bitcoin books, bleh.

But in his case it was specific due to Silk Road no? Or was he operating a general, "unaffiliated with SR" exchange? Cause if it's the former then fine, but if it's the latter then yes, we have a problem.
Then again Charlie was a publicity stunt and he's still innocent until proven guilty...

I'm assuming you mean passive/silent investment where you earn a return if the company succeeds? You have a few options:
1. Bitcointalk.org has a securities section. Watch out for scams.
2. Existing listed securities markets like havelock
3. Reach out to companies you see (and like) and ask if you can invest. I recommend this, but again, watch out for scams and make sure the company is keeping good records and accountability of funds. 
4. Bitcoinstarter

I'd say it's probably the same reason altcoins are downvoted, because in your case, you're fighting against rabid dice players and sites who think their game is one of skill.
Few tips though, shorten the post, and hire a user experience/design guy (like me!) because your site is distracting (where do I focus first?), not mobile friendly, and not pretty or modern looking.
Either way good luck!

Nah, WPA is cracked via de-authenticating an existing device on the network, then, when it tries to connect, you capture the handshake which you can then bruteforce offline to your heart's content. There's a 14.7GB wordlist that has worked on ~90% of networks I have been given permission to crack. Takes about 6 hours to run through the whole thing, usually it ends up being 1-2 hours (on my laptop, could be much faster if I had a setup dedicated for that).

With potentially all due respect, I don't believe you. You wouldn't take an assigned Bitcoin project casually if you were already so interested in the topic. If you're motivated by research you would have jumped on the opportunity to shine. 
Secondly, posting this information publicly, if true, could land you in serious hot water, and potentially discredit your reputation permanently.
Lastly, your conclusion deviates sharply from the story. You conclude using general terms like 'central banks', 'governments' and end on a macro-scope while the rest of your story focuses on one assignment.
**TL;DR:** pics or it didn't happen.

This is a good answer thanks.
One question: isn't it too late when a CURRENCY is being used less as a medium of exchange? Aka if the value starts going down because of that, isn't that already a failure of bitcoin as a currency? 
Also, my question was to do with a competing currency that has small inflation, wouldn't people switch over to it in equilibrium because that value starts to go up and then get into the growth/debt cycle we have today?

Multisig is only for one pair (party to party) of transactions. What about when you have a pool of users matching up with others like an exchange or Kickstarter? You will still need some sort of trusted 3rd party. That's why the word "escrow" is so common and popular within the bitcoin ecosystem

I meant that the benefits XCP brings over BTC are relatively minor on a mass scale.

How does it affect a 'small group'? And tax and fee systems would be present in a limited-supply currency situation as well...

Xbet hasn't worked yet, BetMoose has already (and it's not a casino lol), and is way more interesting, simple, and easy to use and be part of as a human user. Maybe in terms of a dedicated sportsbook, I agree xbet will be better and will eat away at the current sportsbooks - that I would use it for, but for everything else, not sure how I can trust anonymous oracles or a centralized feed I have no recourse in when I just want to make some simple bets on anything.

I think that people generally expect that money you can use online is money you can use "IRL" and so you see a lot of thought being put into making bitcoin as easy and usable as possible, even though yes, as you pointed out, it's at a disadvantage. It's sort of the 'next step'. Btw, credit cards were for online only originally afaik.
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:48:25
Why would you jump to those things though? Just because it's all you hear about in the media? What about absolutely normal business people moving funds between different areas with almost no fees and instantaneously..? You know, using bitcoin the way it's supposed to be used? I would think this is more likely than 'money laundering'. 
Also, it can't be speculating.. speculation = sell/buy BTC (not shown in the block chain).

Okay fine, look: max number of transactions the bitcoin network can handle per day is 604,800. That's only 420 per minute. These are LOW numbers. Forget Snoop Dogg and music albums, think of any purchases you make. How many people shop and transact at all grocery stores across the world? Per minute? Okay no groceries, let's do electronics stores.. anything.. I would be willing to guess way more than 420. That alone will overflow the network.. FYI we used 100k worth of transactions on Dec 1st just within the current bitcoin network.. That leaves just under 500k of transactions the network can process per day before transactions start getting significantly delayed.

Yes, he's right. There was a big research done, I think it was called 'the price of free' or something that showed a massive gap of people choosing free over $0.01 fee, but then a very predictably linear gap between $0.01 and $0.02. Their conclusions were that people did not want the associated pain of PAYING for something, which also included the hassle of entering in cc info etc

An attacker will not be able to do anything with your encrypted wallet file until you use it at least once yourself - this is when he will capture your keystrokes (to temporarily 'unlock' the wallet file), then he has your password to decrypt the wallet and send your coins to an address of his control.

Okay I'm not sure where to start with this..
First off, you mentioning patents and copyright made me cringe. This is really old-fashioned logic and is NOT sustainable NOR the optimal social solution, ever. Whenever you start using those words, immediately start looking for other solutions.
Bitcoin can be copied in YOUR perspective only because it's open source..  You're thinking of it as if everyone could buy a printer to print money - wouldn't work right - we should lock this down to make it more valuable... 
Gold's value doesn't come from the fact that it's unique... gold is valuable because there is demand for it.. the demand stems from its history which YES at one point was because it was 'rare' and 'shiny' and fit certain definitions.. however, we also used to transact with all sorts of things like copper (which rusts!), and used to barter before all of that 'medium of exchange' stuff (I want to have your sheep - will you take 2 of my axes?) -  hence my demand argument. 
Bitcoin doesn't need to be UNIQUE, it needs to have DEMAND, and demand can come from A LOT of things besides the fact something is unique... This fits into what you're saying about how we shouldn't have alt-coins - yes fine, because they DISTRACT from the demand. HOWEVER, they also create MORE demand for crypto-currency in general.. a lot of people have issues with the 21M cap - Litecoin has 4x more than that, hell, Dogecoin has 200B.. 
Others have complained about confirmation times - also fixed by other coins. Those people may enter the crypto market through any of those alt-coin channels, and ultimately at some point, may change their money into BTC, driving demand, and thus value, higher.
Competition is a good thing because it makes things better for everyone. Alt-coins popping us tell us new things about how we use cryptocurrency (Doge), what we value (Stablecoin), the technology possible (Applecoin), and how we perceive it (Mooncoin). There is much more to be said and you should do some more reading to turn yourself into a true future-world citizen! :)

This could never work without thousands of full-time staff arbitrating every transaction made through the network... I don't have the stats but I'm willing to bet the amount of chargebacks or resolutions happening per day is massive. Bitrated is also not that easy to use and it requires quite a lot of hassle to set everything up...
