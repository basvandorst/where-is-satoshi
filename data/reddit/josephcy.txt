That's right but it's also not easy to distinct a good and a bad alts. That's why my main portfolio still adapt index based strategy with market cap weighted to capture the whole crypto market.
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:42:11
Although I'm alwayd accumulating, I still regret I didn't work extra hard to accumulate even more. Lol.
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:46:48
There was a time I try to adapt fundamental analysis, but right now I believe that as an average investor (majority of people won't be able to pick "good" alt) my best chance is to invest in a market cap weighted index approach.

Funny I only noticed that typo now lol

Based on my current income and estimated growth of my business, I would've accumulated a targeted amount of BTC I wanted for 3 years.
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:31:34
That's just a quote to remind us to think independently not to follow other blindly. And how did you know I'm not working hard? I'm sure I work hard enough so that I can get more income to invest in BTC.

You see, people in this Reddit tends to think they know where the price is heading, I'm always surprised people can tell me that "price floor has reached" or "price floor hasn't reached yet".
But that's the thing I don't do, **I never try to time the market**, I just accumulate whenever I can, whenever I believe the price its way below its value.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:30:31
Hope this price could last at least a year :/
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:30:01
Thanks for the advice, I agree that most people should be diversifying and invest what they can afford to lose, and that's exactly what I can afford to lose, 3 years of time.

If Bitcoin is gambling to you so is to stock, currencies and other instruments. While we're conducting our research on stock, we often make a lot of assumption that the past performance of a stock will affect the future performance, for example using discounted cash flow to predict future earnings.
Now because you think you can't conduct research or do your due diligence on investing Bitcoin is simply because it is much harder to quantifiy data, and a lot of assumption has to be made while we estimating the value of Bitcoin.
The only difference between Bitcoin and stock is simply the difficulties in conducting research, and I think if we're going to compare the difficulties of research we should compare Bitcoin to currencies.
Now tell me if one invest in Euro/JPY/CNY is it gambling to you? If not why not?
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:38:33
Well if you're buying/selling based on what people post on reddit, gl.

I didn't try to say that I predict market would go up in next 3 years, but 3 years is more like the time I'm willing to invest (and lose) in cryptocurrency before I decided to turn myself away from this risky investment.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:06:51
Idk why people have to be completely disagree or agree with someone.
There's always something you can learn even from the people that have different opinions with you.
I disagree Warren's view at Bitcoin (and I'm very sure he also said himself he didn't really look into it), but that doesn't make me lose respect or find nothing to learn from him.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:54:06
Teach me how to get crystal ball.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:56:50
Then stop predict, solve the math, use different equations you learn from the Economic class, estimate the potential usage and value for Bitcoin, sure there'll be a lot of estimation and guess work, but if the results is you believe Bitcoin price is well below it's "intrinsic value"(which can vary from people tho), then you can start accumulating.
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:00:07
Seems like Bitcoin is only "Get rich quick scheme" to you
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:40:18
I've got an idea for you, leverage and short BTC if you're so confident about it going to $0.00. Just make sure you contribute to the society when you became a billionaire.

First of all, when I quote Warren I just meant to quote that very sentence where Warren warn about not to follow the market blindly.
Yes, just that sentence "be greedy when others is infear…"
Which is the very thing I do agree with Warren Buffett, but that doesn't mean agree one thing with him means I agreed with all his investment choice, because if that's the case I'd just buy BRK.B
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:36:16
I'll be investing 70%\~80% of my monthly net income (income generated through my own business and minus income tax) into Bitcoin for the next 3 years, if that's what you want to know.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:30:59
You're absolutely right.
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:49:13
Please enlighten me.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:33:12
You're right about working hard, and I completely agree with you, that's why I also work very hard on my business.

That's exactly what I'm trying to say, this idea behind this is very simple, and most people understand the idea, but in real world, people chose to follow the herd.

Do it, give them pressure, or else they're just going to relax and don't care about their clients.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:26:10
The only thing that I quote Warren is the sentence that he said that we shouldn't follow everyone else blindly, since when did I mention I'm following Warren's investment advice?
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:02:49
I hope you're right, the one last thing I'm afraid is I can't even put 3 years of income into it.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:07:36
I hope Bitcoin stay low for 3 years until I accumulate enough :/
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:30:12
Clearly you're the idiot, I'm not talking withdrawal USD, but withdraw your funds. I've always got my withdrawal from BFX within 5min, worse case? 12hours max.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:39:31
If they can't process withdrawals, stop taking new deposits. Simple traffic control. If they're not capable of making that money, don't.
At this moment they're just going to lose more reputation.

If you search about "Bitcoin valuation" you can easily find there's more than 100+ different way people use to evaluate the value of Bitcoin, but due to difficulties in collecting data, a lot of estimate and assumption has to be made, which is why the value of Bitcoin can vary a lot between people.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:50:42
I think it's easier to reply to your argument 1 by 1, so here is my reply:
1. There are actually more people accepting BTC than you think, and my business alone is accepting BTC and half of my business transaction are done via BTC.
2. No one here is saying that we buy Bitcoin because we "think Bitcoin is better than altcoins", me myself find that various altcoins did show very good potential, that's why I'm also investing in some other altcoins.
3. I think the best thing you can do to understand Bitcoin value is to learn about the underlying technology of Bitcoin, then look into the PoW and real-world investment VC has been investing in this field.
4. You're right about that central bank do able to inflate FIAT, and that has been done via quantitative easing. You can't inflate Bitcoin directly, you can only manipulate the market, which is a very different thing.
5. Again, the best thing you can do is really read about Bitcoin underlying technology and understand it's economic value

Why make such useless reply when you can put that time of browsing reddit to process those withdrawals?
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:35:56
Process my withdrawals. 
If you can't handle the growth, control it. Stop accepting new deposit until you process your withdrawals.
You're just going to lose more user for delaying the withdrawals, people won't be using your platform anymore for such horrible experience.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:49:55
Well, I'm hoping that it would go down another half, it's so expensive to accumulate more :/
