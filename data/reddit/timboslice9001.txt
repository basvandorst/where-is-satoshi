The guys that won his place are awesome! I was a server in Portsmouth and they would frequent the restaurant I worked at a few summers ago. Very nice people!

Maine is cheaper? Uuuuh I don’t know about that. They have income tax, sales tax, high property taxes, high registration taxes. In the end it may be more spread out but NH is just more concentrated if you own property.

Interesting. I’ve always heard that Maine runs pretty high taxes. You’re right though, NH housing is insane right now, and renting is more expensive in some aspects. It’s wicked unfortunate. I guess it makes sense that central Maine is cheap since there’s not much out there...same with northern NH. Any industrial or metropolis area will be more expensive no matter where you are.

Right. It’s weird though. I worked at a restaurant for a while and even the owner had a hard time trying to figure out what was taxable and what wasn’t. So if someone bought, let’s say, a bag of chips at this restaurant, they would be taxed. But if you were to go to the nearest gas station you wouldn’t be taxed. Maybe it’s the venue that deems food “prepared” vs a grocery item? I’ve never understood why some places can tax an item while other places won’t tax the exact same thing.

Well...kinda. Sales tax on food and lodging and alcohol. So tourists are the target.

Fair enough. Hard alcohol can only be bought at state run stores so that’s more of what I was getting at and restaurants tax it as well. But yes, beer and whatnot at super markets won’t be taxed. Alcohol is one of those weird areas that’s taxed whenever they feel like it hahaha

Yeah it’s the same in NH. I had a coworker tell me the property taxes he pays are about as high as his mortgage payments. He’s sitting on like maybe 1.5-2 acres of land. Just insane and it’s very hard for new buyers like myself to get into the housing market.

One of my coworkers had the same issue. They would constantly get into bidding wars with other buyers and would be bid out of money very quick or they would take too long to decide whether they wanted the house. I think it took them 2 or 3 months to find one, and they were aggressively looking plus they had a good realtor. I think the prices are still within reason that people can still afford it, for the most part, (of course inflated prices are still out of control) but it’s the property taxes that really kill it. It’s almost like paying two mortgages in some towns.

I was saying taxes are more spread out in Maine. More concentrated in NH. And I meant registering cars for state and local taxes. I worked in Portsmouth for a bit and my boss told me her registration ran in the thousands for her car. She lived in Kittery. Maine has lots of coast line that’s all pretty expensive. You can get land “near” the coast for cheap but of course it would be inexpensive because it’s not right on the ocean. Many people rent out their coastal homes in the summer in Maine to help pay for the property taxes. That’s a pretty well known tactic, otherwise they would lose their property to the town.
