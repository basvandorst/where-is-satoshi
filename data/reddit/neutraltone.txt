Of course, sorry. I didn't mean for my comment to be conveyed as snarky, I just wanted to give you the link incase for some reason you hadn't seen it and also for the benefit of future readers.

I'm guessing you have [seen this]( by know

Keep listening to your cognitive biases, it will get you far and make you look very intelligent.

That damn 'cursive' font deceleration in your font-family attribute but I'm sure you already knew that ;).

I think they are worried about their future. Acting like this doesn't really do them any favours though...

They are open source so the code is all be there to scrutinize. It would be interested to know if anybody has independently assessed it.

Indeed, I thought the majority of people did, especially in this sub. I have two real email address, one I use for signing up to things and another I actually use. They are both a cesspool of spam though, mainly down to my own laziness.

I hate to bring up the past but with current prices does this still stand?
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:29:02
Do people not have an email address dedicated to this kind of thing?
@_date: 2013-12-31 11:41:06
That's actually more insulting than my original intentions. Excellent!

I agree but Alex Jones is a but of a moron. 
**Edit:** *bit but I think the arse of a moron has a better ring to it. He has some valid points but he is terrible at backing anything he says up with creditable sources. Also chemtrails and flouride, wut?

I'm still pretty new to bitcoin but feel I have a pretty good understanding of the concept and how it works. One thing I'm still rather bemused about is how these people manage to sell such a large amount of coins so quickly for the value they are worth at that particular moment in time? I have been playing around with a tiny amount of coins I have gained from watching various 'get paid to watch sites' but from my experience these transactions seem to take some time. If anyone is able to enlighten me or perhaps point me to some relevant literature I would be most grateful.
For the record I'm seriously considering jumping in for the longhaul with the rest of you.

I'm completely on your side OP, upvotes should always be about content relevant to the subreddit and not based on opinion / agreement with a comment. I have a healthy amount of respect for this sub and have found it's users to be kind, informative and helpful people. The reactions to your post in these comments is really starting to alter my perspective.
I don't know why everyone has singled you out. This sub is about promoting the use of Bitcoin and encouraging adoption for a wider audience, it even encourages people to promote their businesses here as they adopt Bitcoin.
You've obviously put in a serious amount of effort building your rig and the rest of your business and in turn have even taken steps to help this community. Reading some of the comments in this thread just makes me feel like the community is throwing that effort back in your face and not exactly portraying users of bitcoin in a good light.
Please don't let the negativity of some of the comments here detract or discourage you from accepting Bitcoin or even maintaining an active role in this sub.
Your product looks awesome. I have a keen interest in photography and film myself, it's been a hobby of mine since I was a kid although my work as a web designer/developer hasn't allowed do as much of the hobby as I used to. Keep on keeping on, you've got my support!

It will be interesting to see if they comment on this. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:04:30
Are we sure this post isn't a tactic to spread negativity amongst the bitcoin community in order to drive the price down even further?
This is pure speculation on my behalf, could just be being genuine but it seems a little suspect to me considering there is [another post of exactly the same nature]( by @_date: 2013-11-29 19:43:01
Making a comment to complain about a post which is complaining about a post, you're just as bad. Why can't people just be nice...
