I think you can also have the opposite again, with metcalfe's law or the [Network effect]( more users gives it more utility and more value

Good to see another Australian exchange, I've been using coinjar and btcmarkets. I found btcmarkets to the better, coinjar took 3 days once, to transfer bitcoin from my coinjar wallet to my private wallet, and customer support - zero never answered any emails or support tickets.
Will definitely give you guys a go.

My father passed away last year, the last couple of years he suffered from dementia, the whole family new he had money put away for the grand kid. Out of respect for him, no one touched any of that. Now as we began to execute his will, have discovered the money has been pilfered by the government? Over 20k

We will get our money back eventually, Its just the fact that know one informed us, not the bank nor the government. I'm sure there is many elderly out there who have totally forgotten they have accounts. Fortunately, we were aware of the account. I don't see how this is reuniting us with a lost account, if they don't let you know. 
This is the Australian government by the way, I don't know what goes on in the US.

Just stated using DuckDuckGo, Love it. The results on the first page of a google search are there because of SEO companies. The better SEO company the higher they rank. How is that organic!

I run some test with Chrome, FireFox and IE11 and found IE to be the least memory hungry, on my Windows 7 OS
