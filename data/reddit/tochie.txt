Each user now gets a freshly generated (unique) address on login per session. I have added code to support that using Coinbase Node API. Please test and provide feedback. This scam feedback has to stop for Kryptogift. Its really a good app. Give it a try.

Thanks for the question.
When person A sends $100 worth of btc, the app generates a unique confirmation number logged in our system (Everyone seems to be missing this part). You can track each transaction with that number. When you go to your "My gifts" tab/link in the header of the page, you can see your gift listings, each one with their own confirmation (again, this will always be unique). 
An email is sent to you with that confirmation number, everyone gets a different one. On the admin dashboard (not open to the public), we can monitor the status of each transaction and mark it as "completed", which auto-sends an email to the sender confirming completion. 
Guys, this is a fully working Node app. Really state of the art. So far we've sent over 50 transactions (during stealth-mode).  I am the lead developer of the app, and I'm here to note your queries/worries/issues and attempt to implement them. Thanks. I have also updated the FAQ to reflect this response, since you asked.
Once again, the only way to be certain about our integrity is to give us a try with something really small. Make the recipient yourself, and see how it goes from there. I've been in reddit for a while, its my community, I'm a bitcoin advocate and willing to be right in all my dealing with everyone.

You can hold some USD or send it to anyone at their (or your) email.

SCAM! Be careful some may not be right....

Lol, Australia is not even a a valid country, not truly independent...
Post from Quora: 
"It could be argued that Australia is not  truly independent even today...we have a foreigner as our head of state and a curious legal requirement that said foreigner, must approve any law before it is legal.
Most people will point to 1 January 1901 as the day Australia became independent..but that doesn't explain the:
Balfour declarations of the 1920s
The Statute of Westminster in the 1930s
The National flag was not changed until 1953
The Australia Act of 1986
Hardly independent it would seem..."
You are basically a non-entity!! I'm done talking you can reply yourself henceforth.

Can we confirm that kryptogift is no longer a scam. Unfortunately, this is the first thing people see when they search on Google, not good for the app's life. 
Perhaps a new post confirming its not a scam, with the same volume of  upvotes ans the downvotes here.
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:15:23
Try it out again. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 15:37:00
Yea. Got it. Kryptogift is nothing like that. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 18:19:01
What are your reasons for concluding it is scammy? Please share. These days its easy to say things are scammy when the reporter may not even have tried out the app. Awaiting your response. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:16:55
Yes. The reasons why that one user considered it a scam have been resolved. Kryptogift is by no means a scam. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:56:20
Yea! Next time little boy, don't assume a non-idealistic imagination. "I'm jealous because I live in America?" lol! Wow, that's the funniest paradox I've ever heard... What an insanely yet hilarious remark... 
Please it would do a great favor and service to do some research before talking crap! Anyways the good side is that it makes me laugh hard. Perhaps keep it up.

KRYPTOGIFT IS NOT A SCAM!!

You can now send money (USD) to anyone's email using your bitcoins. They go as high us as $10,000 per transaction. Really good!
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:49:50
Yes it came out of Australia by an American. Internet came out of America, the computer came out of America, Google came out of America, Telephone came out of America... are you serious? You want me to keep listing US discoveries/innovation vs Australian? Even Reddit.com was born in America and HQ'd here too. Please!!
@_date: 2017-01-20 02:55:57
Yes there is.
I used  You send bitcoins to their wallet and they send USD equivalent to your (or anyone's) email. They go as far as $10,000 per transaction.
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:51:16
What do you mean by HYIP? 
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:17:31
Can you explain further? 
@_date: 2017-01-20 21:58:10
Wow! How do you know there 's not backend system that does that? I developed it. It has fully working backend system that does that. KryptoGift is a Nazoka Inc company registered in the United States. 
I am going to upload a section about the technical details later. Basically every request to send money, is stored in the database with the unique confirmation number. You are able to see your gifts, with in the "My gifts" section, with the associated confirmation number. 
When you send the bitcoins, the USD equivalent, which you specified is forwarded to the recipient's via his/her email provided. This is a fully working Node app on a MEAN stack. The only way to know if it works is to try it out. 
You can hold me responsible. Flag me if it fails. I am the creator of KryptoGift, and we have been doing this for sometime now (stealth mode). KryptoGift's entire code is privately hosted on Github.

Wow. Interesting! Arnhem... Raining insults on Americans..
When last did any technology come out of Arnhem? What startup is publicly known that hails from Arnhem? Facebook? Twitter? LinkedIn? lol. Well, even Bitcoin, isn't Satoshi American? living in America. Bitcoin Capital my foot!!! You don't have more bitcoin users than New York City, not to talk of the entire America. Please respect yourself.
