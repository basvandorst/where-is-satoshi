Why are you so angry over people making fun of your imaginary money?

And that's alright because people in Europe make minimum wage.
Here in the States, waitresses and busboys are literally making less than minimum wage, with the restaurant assuming their tips cover the rest. If you refuse to tip them, you are screwing them out of money that was passed down into lower food prices.

I've worked in the waiting business before.
People whose tips don't bring them to $7.40 get fired.

Dude what are you talking about?
I feel like you're getting extremely angry about something but I honestly don't even know what.
