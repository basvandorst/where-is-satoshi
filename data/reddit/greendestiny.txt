Possibly what it says is that he is a full of shit scam artist that has previously misrepresented his store of bitcoins and saw another opportunity when satoshi's identity came into question.

I'm confused as to how you went from proving that his posts were fakes to thinking that was a good case for him to be Satoshi just because they were old fakes. He seems like a clear fraudster who may have (or have had) a lot to gain from seeming to have access to a million bitcoins. Does the liquidation report confirm that he had a large amount of bitcoins or did he simply claim such?

Yes but the early adopters priced in the hype early and the fundamentals of its current usage patterns haven't started having a big impact on price yet.

Not only that but coinbase and these other companies could use another cryptocurrency pretty easily - it isn't about bitcoin itself necessarily - some of them will succeed whether bitcoin does or not. It's actually a really good thing for investors to be seeing the utility of cryptocurrency not just the speculative gains of bitcoin.

Yeah no evidence of anything pre 2011 though, so it's not exactly proof that actual Satoshi emails were still there.

You have to factor in Satoshis hacked email as well. Basically every interaction Satoshi had may have been available for CSW to view.

Sure it's not like people are sitting around wondering how to transfer money before bitcoin came along. It's just my theory that the bitcoin ledger will be better way to be sure of transactions for businesses than the current system. Maybe it'll only ever be for a certain size of transaction, or overseas transactions but I can see it finding its way into business deals.

This is exactly the point, BTC to fiat is only the second half. If you think in less than 4 days you get that other company to understand and trust BTC and convert their funds into it you (in Egypt no less), transfer it and then put it back into fiat - you probably deserve to be laughed at.
I think one day BTC will be the language of business transfers - lawyers will love the irrevocability of it and having something to match with their paperwork - but it certainly isn't yet.

Both parties have to trust the bank, its records and its response to the legal process should they run into conflict. I doubt it's trivial with international transfers.

It's often a lawyers job to make sure funds get transferred correctly in a settlement. While initially it seems like a risk as there would be a liability if they got it wrong (and there would be) the lawyers can take full control of transfer and have completely verifiable records of it. No having to rely on bank records and other crap if someone disputes it.

Peter Todd claimed he had been forwarded emails from 2011 that prove the hacker gained the account contents
@_date: 2016-05-06 00:18:02
Yeah I think he was a reasonable candidate to be involved. I think his response to the situation initially (to say he had nothing to do with it anymore) has been downplayed a little too far. His communication and language seemed nothing like Satoshi's known style though.

The public bitcoin ledger seems like it eventually be a cleaner thing to execute contracts on - it doesn't have to an address the lawyers control but both sides and lawyers can verify it.

Thanks mate. Yep sign up is painless, that was an excellent experience. Withdrawal seems slow but then it's not for immediate transactions.

It's not as simple as technical or social or political. Every altcoin differs in all those respects and more besides. Bitcoin isn't going to change to POS any time soon - anyone interested in POS will invest in POS altcoins. This leaves the Bitcoin community even more strongly in support of POW and so it goes. I think apart from inherently compatible or uncontroversial changes no altcoin really has the power to morph dramatically.

Oh FFS retards this isn't prediction for the future of Bitcoin, just a refutation of the idea that Bitcoin protocol can be anything and hence beat any altcoin. Your 10 satoshi investment is safe from the horrible crash that would be caused by someone doubting the future Bitcoin in a reddit comment.
@_date: 2015-02-24 03:02:22
There are lots of protocol changes so radical that by the time there is consensus about their importance the altcoin that implements them will simply have too much momentum to be beaten by a change in Bitcoin protocol. For long periods of uncertainty people will simply trade between the two coins based on what they need or their changing views - and that will reduce the price and dominance of Bitcoin organically so that any protocol change will come too late.

This is a great idea, I've been wanting to try out changetip. Thanks!
