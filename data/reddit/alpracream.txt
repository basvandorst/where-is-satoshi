It's the largest darknet marketplace.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:13:41
Have you read the LN whitepaper? It even suggests that blocksizes on the main chain need to be increased in the future as well. You do not make a good argument. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:21:43
Yeah, it's best use is as a highly speculative store of value. There are other coins with fees less than ten cents that get confirmed much faster that are widely accepted as payment you can use now. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:54:44
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:53:39
It hasn't in a long time, still at 1MB block sizes and huge fees/confirmation times. Bitcoin is not usable as a peer to peer form of payment. It's just a highly speculative store of value right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:53:58
It is highly overvalued.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:32:11
Dream market mostly.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:51:05
Good point, it makes sense now!
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:02:11
Yeah but doge isn't accepted nearly everywhere bitcoin is accepted like bitcoin cash is. I have almost a million doge, I would love to spend them somewhere.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:03:47
It is not accepted in nearly as many places unfortunately. Also you can't just buy for usd easily. I have almost one million doge, I would love be able to spend them somewhere.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:30:49
If trading were as easy as finding patterns on a chart, a child could do it. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:10:41
This is one reason I use bch for transactions instead. That is terrible lol, why make yourself suffer through this?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:23:05
A recent peer reviewed study found there was "no sound, quantitative arguments against maximizing block size" google it. Most average users have no idea what the LN even is.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:22:39
If you like bigger blocks, there is a bitcoin fork called bitcoin cash you might want to check out. 8MB blocks, very cheap transaction fees and fast confirmations. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:05:18
Yeah for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:08:59
Please stop spamming this. I am going to start reporting you.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:29:53
I don't want to have to buy a hardware wallet to feel secure participating in a transaction I use on occasion to buy drugs though. Bitcoin is just getting too expensive for the average consumer and it doesn't seem there is any hope for it be usable like it used to be for me again.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:53:20
Because it is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:25:52
Zoom out, we have been in an obvious bear market for months. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:23:51
I'm sure there will be another tether infused pump to save the day for you as usual. Hang in there.
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:15:43
They know what they are doing.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:38:06
Because the veterans are the smart ones that are selling.
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:37:50
Oh I agree! I was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2018-08-01 09:42:45
haha, so true, I actually almost wrote that myself!
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:27:38
Likely to see a bear market? Zoom out to the weekly, we have been in a bear market for months!
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:26:45
It's always going to be a great time to buy, until tether stops saving you. Then you will be crying.
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:03:25
I'm so sorry, but you have been misinformed :( this has been going on much longer than you are aware of. Here is a graph showing the rise of tether production in correlation to the price of bitcoin that occurs much earlier than that.
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:14:58
Thanks, but I think we will have to agree to disagree on this one. There were times when 100million tether were printed and then the price rose soon after. 100million is enough to move the market significantly.
@_date: 2018-08-26 04:01:51
How is it her bitcoin if she doesn't have the private keys?
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:58:17
I would have sold it a while back.
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:39:52
That is disgusting. Instead of focusing their attention on increasing awareness of crypto, we are having a crypto civil war.
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:41:07
Great example of how convenient bitcoin is as a fiat replacement.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:30:15
So much volume today, this has to be good right?
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:31:26
Yeah, I have many accounts. I do value privacy, notice I post in r/privacy quite a bit?
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:59:51
Just one example of a thread in r/privacy I posted in recently helping somebody out  I also post in r/darknetmarketsnoobs and help people out as well. I also moderated a darknet subreddit, obviously for opsec reasons I do not keep the same account for long periods of time. I have been contacted by motherboard and the financial times for an interview when I made a comment that recieved unwanted attention for talking about bitcoin fees and how I was switching to bch, the post got 400 upvotes and they wrote articles about how darknet market users are switching to other payment methods.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:39:38
Why do they have autobot set to remove all negative posts? Try it.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:14:15
You don't understand, try posting something about censorship or something negative and see what happens. Thats why im getting upvoted right now.
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:33:06
Imagine how different this sub would be with people other than a bullish opinion were allowed to post here. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:30:03
A kid can dream I guess. Can't believe people are buying into this. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:38:28
Were you around for the constructive blocksize deabates years ago here, this sub was more open minded and balanced.
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:31:35
Soon you are going to turn that sword in the direction of your wrist as price continues to fall you crazy hodler
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:54:27
It was a shame.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:46:18
You must of not been here a couple years ago for the healthy debate, this place changed over time.
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:56:30
Down 50% since Dec 2017.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:25:38
If nobody bought at the top, eventually there wouldn't be a top and the price would be low as hell. There needs to be people holding the bags for this thing to work.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:36:54
At least you only lost your useless dirty fiat and not any crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-01 22:30:33
Good luck overthrowing the government buddy.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:20:44
If everyone stopped buying when the green bars were going straight up, then the price just wouldn't go up at all. The market needs people to do it so others can make money.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:40:40
This is great, I love it! 
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:23:14
Cash works just fine, no middlemen needed.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:41:20
Only when it's going down though, when it goes up, you can spam it all you want!
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:24:29
Maybe they were interested in buying it for drugs and not adopting it as their every day currency of choice.
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:42:39
There are many ten year olds out there that have been adopted and found a loving home, your little boy has had a chance, the whole world heard about him last year, yet he still remains in the orphanage. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:57:08
Of course, it's the only thing I've used crypto for for the last five years.
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:00:59
I've been using it for buying carded gift cards on Dream lately, been eating like a king for almost nothing!
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:34:47
This is r/bitcoin, everyone just hodls here, they don't know how to trade. Wrong target audience.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:08:53
I have been wall watching for many years and only seen a wall get sold to a very small number of times and even they get pulled. Buy and sell walls happen all the time to manipulate the price in a certain direction. When the market is bear, they put up big buy orders to make people think the sentiment has changed and the price is going to go up and when it is a bull market they put up big sell orders to keep the price down for a bit so they can accumulate. Bots will put their sell orders in front of the large sell wall and then they buy up the cheaper btc before removing the wall for the next leg up.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:40:16
Every time there is a dump, people in this sub try to encourage everyone to hold on and take the losses.
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:20:25
It has been happening since exchanges were a thing, I think most of us are just used to the manipulation by now. Just a part of trading. There were quite a few articles written about the bearwhale in that video.
I also updated the youtube link in my previous comment with a better quality version of the video!
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:02:16
Yeah but if you want to buy something immediately, you can do so with cash, credit, and debit. Can't do that with bitcoin today.
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:58:51
I've never had to verify for a 13k withdrawal. They have my bank account, but not my id or anything else. I've had my account since 2013 so maybe it's different now, but for me I have never had to verify and I can purchase up 100k per week now.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:01:53
lmao, op must be new.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:17:50


@_date: 2018-07-31 19:04:54
You know there has been even bigger sell walls that were real?
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:17:53
Ive been spending it on drugs for years, only reason i got into crypto. Drug users in general are the largest spenders of it.
@_date: 2019-05-09 03:55:30
Then they would make another counter argument about how their system has chargebacks in case of fraud and that their funds are FDIC insured for up to $250,000 but if their crypto is stolen it is gone for good. I know that sounds pretty crazy to us, but it seems like they are perfectly fine and feel more secure with their current financial system.
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:05:47
Someone seems desperate to find someone to hold their bags.
@_date: 2019-05-17 00:08:46
Ver is not a developer, he just speaks publicly on it like Andreas Antonopolos does for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 00:11:22
Also discourages people from making transactions on many goods and services under 100$ or so. It's great! What the hell was that Andreas guy talking about a couple years ago when he said bitcoin was good for microtransactions that's just crazy talk!
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:37:47
You are better off selling it.
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:31:56
Hey whales, hire me!
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:25:34
@_date: 2018-12-22 05:03:01
But you need greater fools to keep the price up.
@_date: 2018-12-24 05:21:19
Doesn't sound like people really care about bitcoin outside of nerds, drug dealers, scammers, and traders. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:26:17
I knew this was fake, buttcoiners never sell!
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:18:49
How would you reply if they said, bitcoin itself is not a scam, but the crypto ecosystem as a whole is full of scams, price manipulation, misinformation, and theft? I hear this one quite a bit, it leaves me stumped.
