Bitcoin becomes obsolete when its more profitable to "mine" wallets then blocks. While it can happen it wont happen because of the unreasonable difficulty and compute power needed.

Wow the phishing site loads faster.

Its funny I was looking at some of today's blocks and still see tons of transactions over 800 and a handful over 1k. I just sent one for 39 to my exchange, it should be added to the next block maybe two =)
Its great seeing this, bitcoin was fucking useless for buying things the way it was. Now people need to roll back the savage fees for mining payouts.

You can call it Apple Unlimited all you want but the main body of the computing industry will continue to call it Aunlimited because its not fucking Apple.

How about just a nonprofit? Maybe hook up Wikipedia. They may not be helping people with access to things like clean water but the site as a whole and its values are unquestionable.
I would also like to suggest archive.org, Its another great free information source.

Yeah and Ill keep using my credit card with PayPal because I can charge back when a seller fucks me. I managed a support queue for them, and could never trust them after everything I have seen.

Whats bitcoin?

Thanks, just scared I fucked up again, I have a number of old wallets I can no longer access from back when I mined with a pile of 5850's and sold half bitcoins on eBay for 35 bucks. It fucking killed me looking at my old blockchain bookmarks of them when I heard BTC hit 8k USD after forgetting about it for years.

When I was selling .5btc on eBay for 35 bucks I thought fuck I wish I had never sold them in the past for cents. a short time later I was fucked over by BFL and stopped mining. What I have now and am mining wont be sold until I can retire on it.

Prior to checking back here I thought I would try sending more coins then I have to a random address. It asked me for my password then said I did not have enough money to complete the transaction. I then attempted to do it again but entered a knowingly wrong password and it said the password was incorrect. I should be in the clear now right?
I was trying to avoid fees for needlessly sending coins.

I remember not long ago I was selling half bitcoins on eBay for 15 bucks us.
