I sent one as well, ten minutes ago, still no reply other than the automated bullshit. Goddamit, literally everytime I use bitinstant they're fucking something up.

Now it's been a *half hour* since the customer service rep asked for info, still no response. This better not be like before where it's going to take days to fix, I'll be *incredibly* pissed off.

Got my four BTC. Time to buy shit on Silk Road :D
BitInstant -- make sure this bullshit doesn't happen again. Seriously. I'm tired of having to bite my nails everytime I use your service.

So, what, is our money just sitting in limbo until they get off their asses to fix this?
@_date: 2013-06-28 13:29:14
How long do you think before this shit gets solved?

Well, I *finally* got a response from tech support, asking for more information, so I pasted him literally everything. 15 minutes have gone by, no response. They are totally unaware that this is happening.

Are you saying these retards aren't actually sending the BTC, just saying that the order was "executed"? Where do you find the hash on bitinstant to look it up on blockchain?

ORDER EXECUTED!!!!
06/28/13 10:42	Order executed	435f1d82-8aa1-4164-9662-dcd6487b8f3e
It seems after I gave the customer rep my info he fixed it for me, now to wait for the BTC to arrive in my wallet...

I only do direct to wallet as well. They still use Mt. Gox as the intermediary for BTC transfers. You'll have the same issue if you try to send money to your wallet address.

Jesus christ man, this scared the shit out of me. This is like the third time BitInstant made me fear that my money was lost due to their shitty service. I really hope the BTC make it.
