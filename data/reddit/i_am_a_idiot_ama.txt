True too. I suppose time will tell.
For now, it seems Bitcoin learned a lesson from Napster's centralized system, and how easily it failed - and was hijacked by the very corporate media it sought to fight - when put under financial pressure.

And to repeat myself, it's not as terrible as you make it out to be.


The analogy isn't made for Napster's functionality. Napster was a highly public attack on record companies and set off a chain reaction of peer-to-peer activity becoming popularized. Much like, again, for example, *Bitcoin* and banks, today.

Yep, as is visible [here](

That's good, but I'd like to see them accept it as a means of payment.

Dorian's German was very much in jest, and with extremely poor grammar for anyone actually trying to use German properly.

Buffett only misses on things he doesn't understand, and I don't blame him. Many have burned a lot of money investing in 'hot tech stocks' that were overvalued. Buffett tries to find undervalued stocks above all, big stocks like Apple and Google were only really worth his attention when they were at way lower prices.

Admins do not step in on moderation duties of subreddits, they only concern themselves with running the site itself. Moderation duty (including removal of posts they deem unsuitable) is the job of subreddit moderators. Semantics, I know, but the difference is important to point out and remember.

He's a Ben Graham fanatic - long-term value investment is his core philosophy. Being able to put a good figure on a company's tangible value is his specialty, but you're right, these 'fluid' intangible properties like how 'hot' a new product is, how well it's marketed, etc. are tough to gauge in the tech market.
You'll see him betting on resource mining, banks and infrastructure a lot more than you'll see him venture into tech companies. Tech is more the playground for high-risk, high-return venture capitalists, anyhow.

Oh, this would be genius. There's been talks of moving away from the petrodollar for years now. What if Bitcoin was the new petrodollar? ~~Moon~~ Andromeda galaxy, here we come!

I remember reading this when you first wrote about it. Glad to see you around here.
I think people are missing the analogy of Napster, though. It's not just about the functionality (Napster's being centralized makes it different from Bitcoin - torrents being a closer equivalent), but the disruptive, historic concept. 
Like you said, Napster was not the first 'sharing' system. It was the biggest mover in the early movement against record companies, though. Much like bitcoin today, against banks.

I'd like to thank for getting me into Bitcoin with [my first bitcointip]( It's been great fun watching BTC go up and down, reading articles on this sub, holding my coins while the suicide hotline was the top post, and just living it up with some cryptocurrency.

Shhhhh, we know, but to the not-so-techy midlifers and baby boomers, 'Napster' implies *cool, online, edgy*. You're right about it being wrong, but it's wrong for the right reasons in media.
The media's all about buzzwords. 'Napster' is one, heck, it's even been a big premise of quite a few Hollywood flicks. 'BitTorrent' is not a comparable buzzword - and mentions of it usually coincide with 'piracy' and 'thepiratebay'.  A great deal of the younger, tech-adept population already knows about both Bitcoin and BitTorrent, so to get the word out there to people you want to reach out to, you may have to 'translate' things.
I'd rather take a wrong analogy with good connotations that is understood by the target audience, than a correct analogy that relatively few understand and that many will take to mean something bad.
edit: They even state in the same article why the analogy is flawed.


The whole point of saying 'Napster' is just to *draw people in* (who don't already get what Bitcoin is).
edit2: **There's further connotations to this that go far, far deeper than the 'functional' aspect: Napster basically declared war on the record companies when it first hit the net.** (Much like many of Bitcoin's early adopters have been saying about crypto against banks)
**It was the first (or the first *popular*) 'sharing' system to disrupt an established market. Bitcoin *is* exactly like Napster in that regard.**
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:35:38
Because Napster was there first, and started the whole 'screw you, record companies, we can do better' movement that led to popular usage of peer-to-peer sharing like BitTorrent.
Bitcoin, 'screw you banks', etcetera.

Warren Buffett is a god to investors interested in 'classic' stocks. Infrastructure, resources, strong brands, newspapers. He knows how to find hidden gems in those markets and bet on them to grow big.
What he doesn't understand, and generally shies away from (even in investments), and frankly, should have stayed away from in terms of Bitcoin, is modern technology.
My point is, don't discard his intelligence because he overstepped himself on this one point. He is still *the* greatest investor of all time. Just take his word on tech with a giant grain of salt.

They keep using that image of physical bitcoins, don't they?
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:51:14
At the risk of sounding repetitive: the analogy with Napster is far smarter than you'd think. Napster was the first big slap in the face for record companies, much like many of us want Bitcoin to be for banks.

Just another nail in the coffin of shitty printed media.

So maybe there is such a thing as a free lunch too?
@_date: 2014-01-21 12:44:45
I suppose, to a degree, it is a semantics issue. But the analogy is far more on-target than some are giving it credit for, however, because of the implications of 'being like Napster' (as in, disrupting the existing status quo).


If an author makes a good point in a CNN article, it's already quite unusual ;)

There's more to it, too. 
Napster was the first big mover in starting the 'sharing vs. record companies' war (for lack of a better term). 
Bitcoin has long been pointed out to be the first big mover in a 'digital currency vs. banks' conflict.
