Bitcoin is useless. 95% of trades are manipulation.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:48:59
Did the prophecy say anything about 9.1
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:58:28
Or maybe not

You're saying bitcoin price can't be manipulated?
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:51:52
Why do you not speculate in price but instead believe bitcoin is like a god?
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:12:48
Moon and down again! Time to find somewhere to short this
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:15:41
I short all the time and I make money on this shitcoin

Oh memes, that's a good analysis /s
This place is a shit hole
@_date: 2019-10-03 09:33:27
If you could afford to even drive you could afford a shit car after you salvaged your old car. If you handle homelessness for ten years good enough to still post on reddit, then I don't understand why you didn't have the skills or mental resources to fix this situation.

Nope, this is a cult basically
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:56:46
Definitely. The next "big short" might be in the world of bitcoin and crypto. Perhaps the entry is even too late now! Who knows.
@_date: 2019-10-21 21:27:32
Everyone knows about bitcoin. This doesn't matter
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:11:27
Whats a chart
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:19:25
Yeah but last time it reached $20.000 it went down again remember?
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:24:35
This is a cult right
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:02:25
They wont, not in it's current form. It's best for weed, drugs and money laundering
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:51:32
Get in now before bitcoin requires more energy than the entire sun :))
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:15:37
It's a joke to spark a little controversy, this place is just too one sided and everyone gets angry
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:04:30
You have zero impact on the market
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:04:22
I think it's obvious that people go here because they panic and need some sort of comfort to reinforce their beliefs.
@_date: 2019-12-17 13:23:03
I prefer to look at 14nd of joobs
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:31:16
Yes bitcoin is perfect for drugs, sex and money laundering
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:00:23
It will reach ATH so I can short it again ��
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:18:54
Crypto has had mainstream attention for years. Everyone knows what it is.
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:09:53
Can you not launch another bitcoin network
@_date: 2019-12-31 02:04:31
Bitcoin is for internet normies. Sorry it's too well known to be your special little thing. It's a see through bubble with weirdos inside
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:27:08
I never bought bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-17 07:31:41
So you postponed this 3 years and chose THIS moment, alright
@_date: 2019-12-11 10:30:50
It's tedious
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:55:38
Adoption is not spreading, it's dwindling
@_date: 2019-09-26 06:04:21
Nothing changed, people thought a little about bitcoin having the same CO2 footprint as Las Vegas. But we're back in business. It's not that much

Just use cash. It's pretty safe
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:02:49
One btc = one btc
This is good for bitcoin.
Buy the dip.
Buy when there is blood in the street
I'm losing my house
@_date: 2019-09-29 17:55:01
Sorry. If it's common knowledge, it wont happen. If you read about it in this sub, which is mainstream af, it's too easy. Too good to be true.
Make your own prediction. Think.
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:44:20
Yeah heroin and ransomware is good use
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:54:58
Sure, but maybe bitcoin should be used for something else than drugs and prostitution.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:16:41
Right now it reads like "starving person struggles to convert bitcoin to real money because there is no intuitive way"
@_date: 2019-09-29 17:57:19
He is too late. A real sucker that shows up after the party is over
@_date: 2019-09-20 11:48:30
You don't want an honest discussion about the asset that you are investing in? Yeah turn a blind eye and throw you money out the window
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:21:14
*Or* homelessness
