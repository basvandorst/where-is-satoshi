Yeah some one should make Bitpay like but with LN, pretty sure there will be adventurous merchants keening to try

Is there rootstock community somewhere? r/rootstock is like desert

Wasn't lukejr one also of the early guys from the beginning? I recalled seeing Bible material on the blockchain in a very old block

Paid in bcash?
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:04:20
I guess LN, rootstock, CT, simplicity, mimblewimble, 2 way sidechain will nullify them eventually

What is your bech32 donation address

It's btcpay but point is we need someone to make a service from that piece of code as I'm sure not many merchants keen to get it running themselves. They more of looking for an alternative rice cooker to plug and play

Should have options for 24 hrs, and 7 days etc too, for non urgent tx

Naah either is also significantly premined

Can bot run away with user wallets ? Thanks to strong anonymity, much convenient.

The average release period is about 2 months. So it's a good bet for it to come in the middle of this month.
@_date: 2016-06-07 17:55:12
no worry guys, just a glitch
@_date: 2016-06-06 13:59:44
What are possible good things coming out of it besides coolness ?
@_date: 2016-06-01 05:29:59
have fun working on R3
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:02:12
we should crowd fun for miner addresses who get the last block of 25BTC and the first block of 12.5

I don't understand how an ultra geek drama like this has never mentioned bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-30 04:28:35
