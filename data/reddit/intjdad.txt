What world do you live in? This is just so obviously not true I have to wonder how you've become so delusional. Like do you not talk to people or?

Communism is simply the abolition of private property. Inheriting a yacht and a small loan of a million dollars is not the "sweat of your brow" either. You're just using stuff and socially agreed value to exhert power over others. 
Marxist-Transhumanists (which I tend to lean toward) usually are looking at the fact that soon there simply won't BE any jobs for humans to do; so capitalism will just fall apart or turn into feudalism anyway.
However, if we move away from the capitalist system at that time the populace could potentially live lives free from labor (for survival at least). Since their needs are taken care of, they can spend their time developing themselves as human beings, forging social bonds, and doing projects they actually want to do instead of things that pay the bills. The fact we still have to labor for survival is less than ideal by anyone's standards, unless you're a huge masochist.

You don't, but the thing is how hard you work has very little correlation with how much you're paid.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:41:00
Oh boy, here we go
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:37:22
I don't think you understand the terms
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:20:35
Because that's totally why poor people who work full time are poor
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:11:31
Found the Nazi.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:19:35
Afraid people will agree with me?
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:56:45
This is naive for one, and for two you just agreed with me that it's exploitation so I think we're done here.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:00:25
I don't think it's funny, no. This is real, actually. Its only funny to the people who don't deal with it and I think that anger towards said people for their ignorance is more than warranted.

I don't think Anne even paid a thought to bitcoin. She was probably too busy surviving.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:48:26
That must have really hurt your feelings. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:56:33
Why buy when it's actual use is mute at this point?
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:25:54
Fees are part of why I'm not sure it has a future. Full disclosure I bought some back in 2014 to buy drugs but now I can't even really do that. I always loved the idea but its shortcomings dont seem to have solutions on the horizon as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:21:36
Dude shut up
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:51:35
He could save others but he could not save himself
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:07:41
So defensive, but now that you've indicated to me that I'm the one that grants and denies permission; Bitcoin is cancelled. We trade rocks now.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:34:36
Who hurt you? Was it the women? The scary black people?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:34:42
Shh they're about to go commie on us
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:20:12
I think you missed the point 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:27:09
So bitcoin is Christianity now?
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:28:38
Yeah what is this
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:22:31
Why I sold
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:26:47
Great answer to the wrong question
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:52:14
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:47:29
Link to flowchart pls? I can't find
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:29:49
Don't you think it's a little volatile to be used as a currency now-a-days?
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:21:01
Better question is why did you waste your and my time typing this?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:46:46
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:53:08
With these transaction fees and the volatility does bitcoin actually have a future as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:48:43
The minimum wage is 7 in many places so no its not weird to be a single adult working full time with no money to invest
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:29:26
This comment is so bitter and I don't understand why, but it's fascinating.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:53:55
Wouldn't you want to buy the dip.. ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:14:43
Hate it. Free markets? I can't stick my dick in it or anything.
Seriously though we need to start classifying Libertarianism as an obscure kink.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:21:08
Uh dude...
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:24:58
We should post it on our Facebooks so our dumb trump supporting aunties and uncles buy bitcoin and push it to 50,000
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:32:32
That's the only reason we all bought in the first place
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:21:29
The egotism of telling people a story about advice you gave to someone to people who know nothing about you is always hilarious to me
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:45:30
It's because people don't marry friends
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:42:08
Lmao I read this as "please seduce me with your naughty naughty swear words"
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:22:47
I hope for your sake he's not
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:36:41
This is a ridiculous mentality
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:29
Who hurt you?
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:31:27
Fair point
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:24:08
People who unironically say "statists," people who unironically say "statists" everywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:45:57
Unless he's abusive and she's trying to divorce
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:29:58
