Been using Bread wallet for quite some time and they seem the best at the moment.
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:48:17
Haha nice one

In some jurisdictions indeed you do require a license. The UK Gambling Commission has posted a while ago: "An operator needs to be licensed by the Gambling Commission regardless of where they are located in the world, if they provide facilities for gambling to consumers in Great Britain.  Bitcoin comes under the category of money’s worth and therefore any operator offering this facility to gamblers in Britain requires an operating licence or they are acting illegally."

Would be really nice if it works; getting same error though
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:49:49
Must be good match with target group
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:08:07
I'd say job well done!
@_date: 2015-09-02 20:35:19
Nice one!
@_date: 2015-09-08 11:54:03
Indeed nice article. Did they already receive royal ascent from the UK for the new laws?
@_date: 2015-09-02 20:31:40
Well done guys!
@_date: 2015-09-23 11:49:27
Good news!

First 5 are OFAC sanctioned countries and last 5 have locally banned or restricted bitcoin. Most likely their payment processor (BitPay) required this. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:10:14
Has nothing to do with BitPay; Apple does not support the option to select a wallet (like Android does). I share your frustration though ;)

Iphone 6 here, just tried and took 7-8 seconds, which is not too bad I think. Must admit that breadwallet is much faster (around 2-3 sec), but if you don't pay that frequently, 7-8 sec is acceptable in my opinion. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 18:44:05
This is a real piece of art and at the same time informative: well done Josh! 
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:50:32
Hahaha! Made me laugh so hard; thanks for sharing
@_date: 2015-10-21 05:30:42
Or only accept payments via payment protocol, which is supprted by couple of wallets now (inc Copay)
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:16:25
Seems to be a lot of choice these days if you want to buy games with bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-12 20:08:25
Awesome news! I think this will fit really well with the target group of bitcoin holders.
@_date: 2015-10-29 07:07:03
Seems to be working for me
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:42:40
Well done guys, keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:13:55
Great service and I really like their UI (on the dashboard).
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:44:43
Great news; these guys got over 10 million e-wallets which can now be topped up with bitcoin! I wonder when Skrill will follow...
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:17:28
Thanks for sharing, good start for people new to trading. Would be great if you could also cover stop losses, trailing stop orders etc. keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:45:55
Big potential for retail stores, although I believe that bitcoin is more suitable for online payments.
