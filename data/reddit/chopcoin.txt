From what I know, Armory is no longer being developed/supported. So moving your coins to a hardware wallet sooner than latter is a good idea. as for the 3BTC discrepancy/error. It's possible there is a mismatch of versions going on. You may want to try installing older versions of armory, especially the one you originally used to set up your wallet. also make a post to the armory bitcointalk thread, there are experts there that can better help you.

Fellow GTA Canadian hodler of bitcoin reporting for duty.
Here's my two cents on Bitcoin surpassing the price of Gold.
There's a lot of pent up excitement in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space. Every day something new is being built, deployed and impacting this part of the cyber world. From getting a 33% discount on all Amazon products by using bitcoin( to being able to send money back my parents in the Philippines for pennies ( There is really no limit to what this technology can and will do. The price is an arbitrary way to reflect these developments that are happening daily under the surface. Bitcoin will change the world, it already has. Reaching the same price of gold is just one step on the road to the moon. Join us!

question. If I use the exact same entropy (say an image that is exactly 256KB) to generate the private key on two opendime's, will they both have the same private key?

does minitip refer to the jquery plugin from goldfire studios, maybe this is somehow related to the deployment of this tipping service?
thanks for filling the vacuum changetip left :]

probably to good to be true. A reminder, if you don't hodl they keys, you don't have bitcoin.

Article summery: basically shes a subtle shill for ripple, who wants to do what vaultoro's doing, but with the bank of England's gold...which is already being claimed by other gold certificate devises. however, the advantage is apparently there are no storage fees.

I'm no expert, an interesting attack vector against Bitcoin Cash is currently possible in my estimation
If not enough hashing power decides to switch to BCH (or is it BCC? lets just go with shitcoin), from BTC, then it could be very vulnerable to a 51% attack. Especially if only 1% of the hashing power switches...well guess what, a Bitcoin Core maximalist with 2% hashing power can pown you with a 51% attack.
BCH is really going to need at least a 10% hashing power switch from BTC to be safe, and make it somewhat economically infeasible for a significant mining operation to go activist on BCH's chain and double spend all the way to the bank.
Blockchain wars are coming

I'm kinda tempted to take the dive on this one, but more details on what it can do would be appreciated.
What i really want to know is more about this: 
"Thanks to its modular architecture, the Ledger Blue runs multiple dedicated companion apps in full isolation on top of its firmware. The strong security model allows to add new cryptocurrencies or apps without the risk of compromission of the master seed. Transaction integrity is ensured by the WYSIWYS paradigm (What You See Is What You Sign). The flexibility of the device enables enterprise level usage: with all major crypto libraries embedded in the firmware, any type of blockchain can be supported."
so can i have a Monero, Etherum and Bitcoin wallet on this thing at the same time?

I think the ledger nano S has a couple security features that may help in this regard.
The first is that it will erase itself if a pin is entered incorrectly three times.
The second feature is a distress password that will do the same thing if entered.
so with this in mind, make sure you use the longest pin possible (8 numbers i believe) 
memorize your pin, don't write it down. make your distress pin something simple, like 66666666
write down your seed and memorize it over time (4 words a week). destroy the paper when you have it memorized. do not get hit in the head, or suddenly develop Alzheimer, consistently remember to repeat your seed to yourself non verbally when you are bored waiting for the bus.
your seed and pin are two separate things.
the seed is what sets up your account and allows you to recover it (its like the masterkey, ultimate backup passcode thingy). It's the only thing you really need to keep your bitcoin safe.
the Pin allows you to enter into your account that has been set up by the seed. But it is ultimatly not needed for recovering from a seed.
finally test this all out with a small amount of bitcoin, then reset once you have confirmed this can all work. good luck.

we should all send this article to our dads. good read.

its an interesting idea, but implementation it is such a way that impacts/reflects the game is a bit challenging for our small team at the moment. defiantly something interesting to keep in mind.

The goal of the game is to get as big as possible. you do this in two ways: (1) collect the smaller little food lying around that spawns randomly (2) eat smaller players and absorb their mass.
on (1) to collect small little food you simply use your mouse, to point in the direction on where you want to move
on (2) there are several ways to eat other people, you can attack them with Gears, you can corner them against walls, you can hit SPACE to split in two and absorb them.
Its a very simple game, but has a lot of complex nuances that make it equivalent to something like 20 man individual dodge ball. It makes for some random, fun and chaotic game play, that's never the same. each round is different from the other, and its very much a game of skill.
You can play for free in the faucet playground or the king of the hill playground and still win bitcoin in these plagrounds.
There are two other playgrounds: one is exactly like the faucet playground and its every man for himself (but you have to pay 100bits to play)
the second paid playground is also 100 bits but its not every man for himself, its team based. everyone who joins is assigned either green or red, and which ever color has the largest mass at the end of the timer wins.
try it out!

Happy Pizza Day from the Chopcoin Team! 
To help celebrate this historic day, Chopcoin will be hosting two tournaments in 4.5 hours as of the time of this post. Anyone can play, and everyone wins!
Starting at 20:00 UTC we will first have a match in our [new Team playground \(Lowroller\)]( with a guaranteed **prize pool of 0.1 BTC** which will be shared equally among all players of the winning team. We will play for 15 minutes and the buy-in is a minimal 0.00001 BTC.
Afterwards the big guys will have a tournament in the [usual Tournament playground without teaming]( We guarantee a **prize pool of 0.25** which will be shared among all players who are alive after 15 minutes (rebuy possible) according to their respective size. Buy-in is 0.001. (provisional balance is accepted- all buy-ins are added to the prize pool + the guaranteed amount)
Spread the word and we are looking forward to see you later,

well if you come across a piece of paper with 12 random words on it like

don't throw it out.
also look at these apps to see if they jog any memories:

do you remember when you downloaded/set up your mobile bitcoin wallet which app it was? myceliumn? greenaddress? blockchain.info?
you may have copied down a 12 word seed on a piece of paper at the time of initializing the mobile bitcoin wallet. this is very important. 
those twelve words are your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:06:43
not an issue, there are old version of wallets that can integrate old seeds. most of the time seed words are backwards compatible.
