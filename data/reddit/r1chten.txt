China prints Yuan and buys dollars from their exporters. Exporters in turn do not have a lot of places to park money.

It is too early to say one way or another. The BTC community needs to be aggressive to address regulatory concerns. The midterm, high priority,  goal is to have a legal regulatory framework to operate under. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:45:55
The term you are looking for is "de-americanize"
One line of analysis is that China's dollar endgame  is to accumulate gold to have access to a greater proportion of SDR's. SDRs, in monetary policy circles, will be the USD's replacement as the global reserve currency.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:32:19
Nope. 
You can only auto buy BTC. You are therefore stuck dealing with the price swings. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 12:41:39
Unfortunately the BTC ecosystem has not matured to the point of addressing such issues. Any brokerage account where you buy stocks has this prepared and calculated for you via brokerage statements. 
Until then, we are stuck with spreadsheets.

Right now, US hasn't taken a hard stance against BTC. If I wanted to make China fall in line, I would increase aid and military assistance to Taiwan. German banks are beholden by the Fed so it is easy to cut them off. In the end, US has the most soft power/indirect tools than anyone else.

BTC is volatile. If you can stomach it, you should keep your BTC. That way, you can pay your debts in nominal terms (hyper inflated) in the future 
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:25:12
I don't know mate. I was surprised myself.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:45:30
I want to see BTC succeed but we need major bodies to create the legal and regulatory framework.

I heavily debated to trade in my gold coins for BTC earlier this year. I would have made some serious dough however you never know.

You scared me. I bought 4BTC last Thursday @ 292.00 and it is still pending delivery. No message as of yet *knock on wood*

but circle jerk redditors were directed here

bought at $200 and $292.

Mt. Gox did not succeed. 
And the SEC would beg to differ.

I emailed Jeff about Germany's recognition of BTC, I am eager to  see if he responds. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:32:40

1 BTC for $149, looks like a trap to me. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:42:26
Wrong. 
If I owe the bank a $100,000 and I can't pay it, that is my problem. If I owe $1,000,000,000 and can't pay, that is the banks problem. Due to the magnitude of US debt the Chinese hold, US owns China.
Furthermore, IEEPA give the President dictatorial powers to preserve the national security of the United States within the economic space.
 
Good luck cashing out Chinese holdings.  
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:44:41
Apologies mate, my cash cost is dated, for the life of me I saw 2013 last night. 
Cash costs for 2013 are all over the place ranging from $400-$1100. I need to reevaluate this value and get back to the community. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:35:09
Agreed. I cancelled my auto bc of this. 
EDIT: I stand corrected. You can auto-buy with fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:44:08
Good luck mate!
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:29:18
you  dont have to buy whole BTCs, you can buy them in fractions. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:26:54
I recently got into the mining game myself therefore I personally do not have data to say one way or another. If there is another source out there I am happy to re-run my calcs.

Whether you want to admit it or not, the US is key for wider BTC adoption. Although it doesn't control or have direct influence, it has soft power/indirect means to get other countries to fall into line. 
Ask UBS when the USFG made them breaks Swiss laws. 
Ask non-US banks that have access to the Fed discount window.

From an IRS POV, any change in Assets - Liab = Taxable Income. Since your assets went up (appreciation), that is taxable from an IRS POV when you recognize it via a sell.
With that said, you also need to understand what a "tax lot" is. Your two purchases are two tax lots. Assuming you sold both BTC @ 400.
Purchase 1 = Tax lot 1 and your taxable gain is 300 (400-100).
Purchase 2 = Tax lot 2 and your taxable gain is 200 (400-200).
To add another layer, there is a difference between short-term vs long-term capital gains. Long-term receives favorable tax rates and assumes you held the asset for greater than a year.
Edit: This is a simplified example but this can get ugly quickly if you trade or buy/sell partial BTC.
Edit 2: Another tax concept is "cost basis," it is what you paid for an asset. Since you bought two BTC at two different prices you have two cost basis. Furthermore, most tax preparation assumes the asset you sell is the first asset initially bought (FIFO). However you can use the most recent cost basis to calculate taxable gains or LIFO.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:31:37
Two purchases have gone smoothly thus far. One @ 200 and the other at @ 295.

Unless they have early adopter contacts, it will take them a while to accumulate such a  large position. They can speed up the process, to an extent, by accepting BTC as a form of payment for their products.

China has limited investment opportunists due to tight capital controls. 
BTC is one of the very few outlets.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:10:55

negotiated block trades are not uncommon in other markets
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:10:28
You may be right, it remains to be seen. This was a simple comp exercise and does not take into account extraneous variables that may blow my estimate out the water. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:50:11
Nice analysis.
In the world of QE, you may want to narrow the time horizon of nominal money supply growth. 
Here is a source for your gold growth supply estimate, it's on a CAGR basis.

Fundamentally I agree with you, trying to value BTC now is like trying to value the internet in the 80's or Apple in the 60's. 
Members have exposed holes in my valuation which I don't mind, but the big takeaway that I want the community to have is despite my assumptions/discrepancies that boosted BTC's valuation, is that BTC could be the Apple of our generation. The beauty of BTC is that you can buy in small chunks to fit your budget and do not have to participate in regulated investment funds. The biggest downside risk is that regulators kill BTC, therefore we need to be vigilant and work with them to have a prospering BTC market in the US.

Mining Rig ROI is non-existent. I pre-ordered a BFL Rig back in April and missed the rally in BTC. 
Unless you have guarantees for delivery, BTC difficulty will blow your ROI. 
In other words, mining rig orders with no guarantee is like options trading. You are biting losses everyday due to time decay.
Buy BTC outright if you want BTC exposure.

The BTC community needs a coordinated voice to lobby our interests. The big banks already have a head start and have certain members of Congress in line.

You have to recognize capital gains for services. The tax concept is known as "in-kind income." Usually the fair market value for such services is your sell price.

The $41 figure was provided by the poster jcoinner, not me. My derived BTC production cost is $2,377/BTC  and that is based on BlockChain's stats page, see footnote 6.

Yes, I have some cash on the side allocated for such an event.

It makes sense that banks charge a fee. But what boils me is that the Fed's QE policies have taken interest rates to zero. Banks literally borrow for free on the taxpayer's dime and turn around get levered up to make money. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:10:46
with a 50GH BFL miner you can no longer break even. my ~33BTC could have been $9,000 in my account. Furthermore, as the diffuculty rises it is harder to get that incremental BTC. 
Key takeaway is that if a mining rig producer can't send you a product in one month or less, you will lose. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:50:55
Yah, I am very disappointed with him myself.

For the sake of conversation, let's go with the $41/BTC production cost. That values BTC at $352 ($41 * 8.6) therefore interested BTC buyers should slow down purchases and wait for a dip to enter.

I am unable to answer that mate. I am personally buying and mining BTC and would rejoice if  meet a tenth of my estimate.  
I believe other posters forcasted BTC prices using a log scale. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:50:54
Opportunity costs. I purchased a 50 GH miner myself and it was a waste. As opposed to buying the miner I should have bought BTC. When I placed my BFL order, BTC was at $90, so I could have purchased ~33 BTC and captured the gain via appreciation. Given the rise of difficulty and anticipated demand in BTC, the mining endeavor is a loss. 
Thus the frustration at BFL.

Congressmen are short sighted beings that only think in terms of the next reelection cycle, therefore have their ears perked to big campaign donors. BTC is to premature to withstand heavy handed regulatory burdens.
