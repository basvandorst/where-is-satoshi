You're so right. I see posts here about stories of people who have lost x amount of bitcoin that were given to them as gifts or they mined for fun in the origin days that they've now misplaced or lost.

Shit. Looks like I have to declare that 836 million worth of Runescape gold since its technically a digital currency.

They honestly don't realise that bitcoin is an unregulated market at the moment and that pumping the price of BTC and then selling it all effectively shorting it to match their futures position is legal unlike pumping and dumping stock which are far more regulated.

Wallstreet doesn't care about fiat or bitcoin all they care about is making money that's evident in their ability to trade literally anything from the futures of Rice, Coffee and even the shit that a waste management company will export.

This is 3 months old but today 40,000 BTC equates to $800 Million Australian dollars which is where OP is from.

The fact that everyday people can do this really makes me uncomfortable.

To me personally yes. I just don’t like how random people can track addresses with high volumes of bitcoin transactions, this makes a lot of wallets targets.  I like bitcoin and crypto in general but this does irk me.

How do you know which exchange the bitcoin came from? Random people being able to see where bitcoin is moved and to which wallet really makes me not want to adopt this technology unlike Monero.

I just got my first bits of Bitcoin from the Coinbase “earn” promotion. I’ve been reading up on crypto for a while now and finally got some for free. I wonder how many new people the promotion introduced into the world of crypto and Bitcoin specifically.

Please don’t act like Bitcoin didn’t just take a massive $4000+ loss in price and a shit load more in market cap. 
The stock market is doing the exact same thing that the crypto market did just recently.

I admire bitcoin but I cringe every time people with zero economic education compare it to everyday used currencies.

Calm down mate, what’s gotten you so worked up? Let people do whatever they want and complain in silence.

Is Elizabeth Stark, Tony Starks wife?

Yes. If you mention anything that is somewhat negative towards Bitcoin be prepared for an onslaught of downvotes and hostile replies. Talking about negatives within a technology is very healthy and helps to shape those negatives into positives as solutions can be discussed. However, this community, well the bulk of it does not like to talk about the problems Bitcoin has had or is facing.

What’s with all these graph posts? Take almost any investment vehicle and the chart will have a higher value than its inception date.
