You can start paying him and I will cheer you on.

That's kind of true. It's goes hand in hand with the social awkwardness .

No its not. Its would be like saying you got raped because you went next to the rapist, while everyone always said stay away from rapists.

This disclaimer is probably the most useless and funniest use of the concept of adding a disclaimer in the history of disclaimers.
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:55:57
God that just sounds so funny,I had to put it in. Sorry for polluting your thread.
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:58:15
Omg yes!
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:40:16
Very good article. Definitely more improvement needed in that area such as use of INDEPENDENT qualified people. 
And definitely not use the competitor spot checker like some have. 
At least it would prevent the competitor/third party spot checker, ex: decentralized services from later on saying to not trust other companies that they spotchecked, ex: centralized services.

i can feel what you said was smart, but i dont know what protagonism in that context means. help please.

You work at Amazon?
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:38:21
Yawn. Nothing is going to happen. Typical neckbeard. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:56:52
You're welcome.
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:11:43
Have you worked as a PR specialist or have experience in the PR business or is this just very eloquently stated conjectures ?
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:37:35
you can always leave your house and walk outside into public places.
@_date: 2014-05-17 21:55:02
Same way Amazon does. Pooling investors funds by attacking the margins of everyone else.
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:45:20
Well you are confusing branding errors private companies commit versus open material that can be used by everyone and branded any way they wish, therefore, you are likely to be turned off many times over and over. Tldr: waste of energy to get panties in a bunch about it.
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:33:37






that...that's amazing.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:47:24
I am assuming by "us" you mean those that frequent the reddit bitcoin sub or are bitcoin users or both. Eitherway, please don't use "us" so liberally. Because it would definitely be "us minus *yours truly*".

Keep going to them reinforces their power. For Shame ! 
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:37:46
That's futile.
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:04:19
 I understood. Maybe we have different capabilities of understanding. That's all. No need to get mean.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:09:51


ok, but on balance? more or less than the foundation?


Nope, it was asked for it to be removed, not replaced.


Stop nagging. Life is great.
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:00:35
well done, although I suspect you know what I meant. in that case, you're a douche.
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:33:25
True or False. The bitcoin foundation has done more, on balance, for the progress of bitcoin than **you** have.

This is actually funny. If you're down voting this, its because your parents didn't hug you enough as a child.
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:30:46
What company are you referring to?
@_date: 2014-04-26 03:24:40
I feel bad for you, but you have a sliver of fault for putting your life saving bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-07 23:22:50
Can anyone confirm that this graph is accurate?

Approval factorial ? I don't get it. Don't use math.

Apologies, like I mentioned, I envy your eloquence in putting words together. I am not very good at it. 
I meant any experience working in the field, creating or delivering or analyzing PR campaigns/projects. By your answer, I'll take that as a no. Reading your text has taught me how to write eloquently though. I will not argue with your position as I have zero working and practical knowledge of the PR field and would look like to look as little as a doofus as I am. All I have (and is ultimately useless) is my perspective as a target of PR campaigns in everyday life, which I feel is hardly a valid point, sort of like "watching pro football" vs. "having played it".
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:39:06
Anyone else find it funny or is it just stupid me (more likely), that someone says "don't trust...", it also implies "trust me when I say..."
nah, nevermind. i dont know what i'm talking about. carry on.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:14:20


I am referring to the "a company" comment in your reply as this was a sub-response you made to OP's post of a girl wearing tight-fitted costume with bitcoin written on it. So my question still stands and hasn't been answered. What "company" are you referring to?  Is it a company that sponsored that girl? Is it a company that took that picture? Is it a company that owns the building where the picture was taken? As far as I know, "bitcoin" is not a branded company, so what are you referring to?
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:37:51
Someone should test that. For science.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:18:23
I can't believe that supporters of decentralized and freedom technology complained for help and support from the evil overlord government agencies. For Shame!
@_date: 2014-05-12 10:52:49
Imagine asking for a blowjob and this is the response you get. Not very optimistic.
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:27:11
Bitcoin is freedom! Fuck the government!
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:23:31
Here's my take. DarkMarket and FreeMarket are both terrible names.

Anybody know which decentralized service he is using to pay for his worldly items derived from his bitcoin salary? I want to use it.

Although I agree I would prefer that point of view from an antiterrorism expert. Ex: Im not going to rely on reports on traffic speeding from an automobile driver.
Edit for the simple minded: I would rely on reports from say a traffic patrol or traffic operations, etc. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:50:46
i guess when i hear any statement that starts with "Don't trust.." from a person's mouth, my brain, because it's too simple, can't compute out the different forks you are mentioning there and automatically lolz. But you know things aren't always as simple, i get it now.
