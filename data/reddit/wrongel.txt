Latest Wirex communication via email: "Hi *****,
Yesterday, our partner WaveCrest Holdings, Ltd., which provides our cards, was instructed by VISA to close all of its prepaid cryptocurrency-related and standard prepaid VISA debit card programs. The Wirex card is such a program.
WaveCrest did not provide us with any advance notice of this decision
Your funds are safe
We’d like to assure you that all your funds are safe. Our team is working around the clock to ensure customer funds are transferred back from prepaid VISA accounts ASAP.
New cards are coming soon
We have been working with a new card issuer for the last couple of months and are close to being able to release our new cards. As part of this changeover, we can provide free replacement cards to all users who already have cards.
Refund for your ending card balance and for any outstanding card loads
We are instructing WaveCrest to ensure all card balances return to our cardholders quickly.
Wirex is offering card order fee refunds for all users who ordered on or after 1 December 2017. You will receive an email providing you with more details on this soon.
Verified users will still be able to buy bitcoin using your local bank card. We will be releasing our new verification process within the next week. Furthermore we will be increasing daily limits to $500 from Monday.
Please accept our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience caused. We greatly appreciate your support and thank you for your patience. We will soon release an update regarding our new replacement cards.
Please join our Community Manager for a live Webinar tonight at 6pm GMT for further clarification. Register here.
Team Wirex"
tl;dr: new cards incoming ETA unknown

Stop the nonsense shitcoin shilling pls. Those who actually use these cards or bother spending a few seconds reading about them know that everything comes at a price. The actual percentage of fees, i.e. difference between buy/sell rate, ATM withdraw fee, etc - that is the price one is willing to pay to get fiat for crypto in a way that circumvents national personal bank accounts, to have a convenient and safe way to get cash, much like the LocalBitcoins price premium.

Budapest, Anker köz 1-3, H-1061, comission supposedly 7%, they buy from Bitstamp. Sauce (hun):  . 
PSA: HUF is crap so you prolly lose on the EUR/USD change as well since I think they do SEPA to Bitstamp so they need to convert HUF to EUR first but I don't know how they implemented that into the process.

For EU, I can too recommend Kraken, but as always do your research and due diligence.
They require ID scans and whatnot, but hey, SEPA was like 24hrs tops inwards, and when I wanted to get money out, it was intra-day/12hrs out, even tho I live in a shitty country, with non-EUR fiat...
So I like them.

I have a hobby gpu mining rig (X/whatever rented), 60gb ssd, win7, running full node to support Bitcoin network, with port 8333 forwarded (I don't use it as a wallet).

Heh, dirty little scammers. I buy on Kraken, 1-2 days SEPA in same or 1 day SEPA out for fiat so far, BTC withdraw instant. Not shillin' just sayin'. I lose big time on shitty periphery country toilet paper fiat to EUR conversion though...
@_date: 2014-09-07 08:53:07
Noob question: if Coinbase is so bossy, why don't US people use e.g. Kraken or BTC-E, etc? Sure they need IDs as well, but still. Lack of trust or? I'm in EU, using Kraken (SEPA), fast and convenient (not cheap thogh they just recently increased fees) and doesn't harass me with this crap. Not shilling, just curious.
@_date: 2014-08-06 08:08:34

Just another scamcoin (not even launched yet) until proven worthy.
If you want to buy ether to speculate, wait till the first crash, then gobble up the cheap coins from the weak hands. No use to buy this vaporware now, when in the 6 months until launch Bitcoin could bubble again...

@_date: 2015-01-16 06:39:29
No local exchanges here, but here's the deal: SEPA wire is 5€/0.45% fee, so for small amounts you are better off with the 5% fee ATM. If the SEPA fee is less than 5% of the fiat amount, then you go and do the wire to the exchange. Localbitcoins is kinda non-existent here too.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:42:54
I share this sentiment, 2014 was a very cool year for me because of Bitcoin as it became my new hobby. Tried altcoin mining (later turned hardware into gaming rig), got me a new POV on finance, opened my old fart mind to new things, lots of reading on exciting stuff. I use Btc as a store of value, however silly that might seem, for my pocket money, because my country's shitty fiat and economy, and gonna buy more monthly and/or fun trade. If it bubbles, I will sell to rebuy after the crash to get more Btc. For me it's digital gold, I look forward to 2015. My humble prediction: Bitcoin services will grow, price, well either sideways boring 300-500$ or bubble.

@_date: 2014-07-31 15:02:03
While I only have tiny amount of btc and my only gold is my wedding ring, I'd say both. But in case one has to flee, btc is easier to hold in head with passphrase, whereas gold bullions are hard to transport, and one can only have so much jewelry before getting too much attention from ppl with guns.  
Note to self: make paper wallet and memorize passphrase.
Also world economic crisis is not equal to global cataclysm like meteor wiping humans out. People get poorer, lots of shit happens but you still have electricity and internet. Just think back 2008, it wasn't like world war z.

@_date: 2015-01-15 18:26:06
Still, it's ridiculous...
In that timeframe, I could SEPA to kraken, buy BTC and SEPA back to my account back to back almost twice [in weekdays], and get the BTC instantly [not counting confirmation time].

@_date: 2015-01-04 18:23:22
So much this. Cloud mining can not be profitable for the end user, and always less profitable than buy and hold, that's it. Stay clear of it. If you don't want to mine with a miner, just buy your coins.

Stupid article. "Traditional" currency is just debt, a claim vs the bank. Bitcoin is digital cash/gold/silver which you can transact instantly and globally and freely, and except torture/extortion/hacking scenarios,cannot be taken from you (if only you have the private keys), unlike any other form of money like bank account balance, etc which can be confiscated, frozen on the whim of a bank clerk. Not to mention Bitcoin supply is finite vs printing some more fiat to save the financial sector, that devalues your work and savings. How cool is that. So yeah what is the point of actually owning your money and do what you want with it? *rolls eyes*

A couple questions
What is the actual advantage vs an actual exchange, say Kraken or Bitstamp for EU citizens (in b4 the obligatory, "we havent been hacked YET")?
When will you implement SOFORT?
It seems in this brokerage you take fees, take profit from the bid/ask spread, and choose the time of the actual bitcoin purchase within your own discretion, without any transparency.
It seems like a step back from the exchange model, not forward.
There is also this fiasco that involves your VP of Business Development is Ludvig Öberg (aka DeadTerra), the same person who is involved with IceDrill.ASIC IPO ( ? What is the relation of Safello to this failed venture?
Thanks for clarification.

Depending on where you live/are at the moment, you can buy bitcoins with cash from ATMs ("BTM") if there is one near you.
Edit: Mycelium is nice, I use it as well. Make sure you backup your 12 word "seed" in at least 3 different secure places where only you/trusted individuals can access it, on paper (you can add additional encryption, like x character Caesar, or divide it to multiple pieces with Shamir's secret sharing method).

Nah, obviously Bitcoin _needs_ a regulated exchange with its tongue wedged so deep in the arse of regulators, that they will let any US government agency have backdoors and/or direct oversight, and make it possible for them to confiscate/freeze users' bitcoins on a whim, just as easily as fiat from a bank. /sarcasm

I think no mid-large scale mining operation would settle for as high an electricity price as 0.085. "Free" (own solar wind or hydro) to 0.05-6 $/kwh maximum IMHO. But I don't know shit about it so it's just a guess.
@_date: 2016-01-23 08:53:20
Home, smallscale mining where you have to pay for electricity is not. Large chinese mega-farms with very cheap/free electricity/own hydro-plant etc. are very much profitable as it seems imho, even after halving.
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:24:01

@_date: 2015-07-09 10:26:45
Look at it this way: even though these problems are present in BTC, it still moves forward/up with adoption, in price (shenanigans aside), whatever. 
When these problems are eventually fixed, it will hopefully boost it too, not unlike the LTC rally we are experiencing now (fingers crossed lol).
@_date: 2015-03-01 20:52:57
Tried bitlendingclub.com . The site/service is really nice, dev/admin/ceo whatever is very active. BUT. I used very strict criteria as an investor (very high rep borrowers only and basically mainly going for very reputable Localbitcoin traders as they are workinv with a commission so they can profit regardless of price if they have a sound plan etc) and it boiled down to like 3-5 borrowers which means you can't really diversify and play safe with meaningful investments and returns. Every such site is basically a race between admins and scammers. So yeah, by investing 0.7 btc 3x I made 0.05 btc in a little more than one month. The exposure was too high for my taste so I pulled out. With no insurance on loans vs default and no way to enforce payments there is no incentive for borrowers to pay back other than internet reputation which honestly doesn't mean shit as you can have countless interwebz persona, and one swing in price can fuck every party over. Basically it's just a question of time for even the most reputable borrowers to go rogue or scammer. Most borrowers just run their mini ponzi with the help of their buddies building rep, then ask for a larger sum of btc and disappear. So meh. Might return later but whatever.

Putting the carriage before the horse doesn't make the ethereum scam any more appealing tbh.
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:06:27
Well, the point is valid: in case you want to send fiat via piggybacking Bitcoin, you still need an exchange and a bank or a face to face trade to convert it back to fiat.
Might be still cheaper, but that depends on the amount, say Kraken fee is 0.35%, then 0.9% for SEPA withdraw. Don't know about regular wire.
So yeah, more places accepting bitcoin and offering discounts for bitcoin purchases would be nice, eliminating the need for exchanging it into fiat.

If you really want to run a full node on a laptop, buy a separate old crap for that purpose with very low power consumption. I run my node on a single core Celeron M 1GB RAM 80GB HDD 25 watts max power, an Acer 3960 IIRC from 2006-7(?). Was slow to dl the blockchain even with bootstrap but now it's fine. It runs on Lubuntu, just forwarded port 8333 to it and it has 20-30 connections no problems. CPU was 100% during dl but now it barely uses any CPU power except when I unlock the screen and it loads the GUI (or something). The thing or something like that shouldn't be too expensive. Don't know about bandwith I have no limits, but if it poses a problem later I will max connections at 16 and call it a day. Supporting the network and all that.
@_date: 2015-02-05 12:35:35
Nope, you are right. Authorities are gonna have a field day with you in just about any jurisdiction for what seems like a simple way of making some extra money on the sides. 
When you try to do what a bank does, as a private person, you are fucked basically, because you commit a plethora of crimes, even if they are "victimless crimes". Reason: you are fucking with the state's control over money, plain and simple.
IMHO a legit solution could be to make a small enterprise to operate bitcoin ATMs (and pay your taxes). And even then it would be very hard to find a flexible bank for the cash deposits :S . Not to mention, the BTC ATM can be seized any time if a dickbutthead at the tax authority thinks so... 
So yeah, I was thinking a lot about LBC and BTC ATMs, and currently there are just too many hurdles for the simple guy to enter the market.
If you are doing LBC online, your accounts lead to you right away, if you are doing it offline, you will have to change that cash into online credit to re-buy btc, so you are again in the crosshairs for suspicious activity if you make cash deposits ("structuring payments" and all that crap).
So in the end, you would have to effectively and actually launder your btc money, in order to turn it into a "clean" balance on your bank account, just to re-buy btc on an exchange or something.
The LBC margin is the reward for taking this kind of risk, but in comparison to the sanctions, it might not be worth it, even if it seems lucrative.
Just my 2 satoshis.

Just when I figured it out with a bit of google-fu, and resurrected an Acer Aspire 3690 with Lubuntu to run a full node. Good to have this info in one place.
Took it a looong weekend even with bootstrap, but now (after forwarding port 8333) 20+ active connections to the network.
The old laptop (spec: Celeron M 1.6 Mhz single core, 1Gb DDR2 RAM) is fine with the load, during sync cpu usage was 100%, but now it's around 10%, also cca 670Mb of 1Gb RAM used.
Using a mere 20-25 watts altogether.
