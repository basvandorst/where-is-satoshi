Who is the "They" you speak of? Anyone with enough clout to get others to invest in his/her version of the unofficial chain?
Even if so, the only reason ETC took off is that it was the "official" ETH that left the main chain, and was the new forked coin... It's like if someone cloned you and said your clone gets to live your life but you have to sit in the closet and only do his chores.
No wonder ETC was worth something afterwards. It was the real ETH!

@_date: 2016-08-28 03:27:12
Not much; we're close to a breakthrough.
Few people ever stop to consider what it will take for the Trillions of dollars worth of fiats stored in offshore accounts to start moving into bitcoin. Keep in mind that this is _ALL_ value that the owners are trying to hide from tax authorities and others like ex-spouses.
Bitcoin, by design, is FAR superior to those banks for preserving their hidden wealth, but of course the price fluctuates and they just don't trust bitcoin to stay valuable. If only they were assured that their money would not decrease in value then I don't care how complicated the process of buying under-the-table bitcoins is, those offshore banks will all be going out of business.
So the question is one of volatility. Even with the block size debate unsolved, volatility has been steadily dropping. Once that is fixed and some great app like Brave, Code Valley, 21 market, OpenBazaar, or a better DAO comes along making bitcoin desirable to more people, therefore bringing the price up to new record highs, investors will take another look.
After they see that it's a huge earner and the volatility has dropped far enough for their tastes, they'll start trying it for themselves.
Once money of That size starts flowing in, simply using bitcoin as an asset to hide wealth and not buying daily coffee with it, it's all over; the snowball will be there and the price will have plenty of new zeros behind it.

A 'financial armageddon' sounds like a very good thing indeed for bitcoin. 
If the net were to go offline, however, the 1st world would be so screwed it's almost a zombie-movie scenario. We do all kinds of things like shopping, banking, emergency services, etc., online far more often than not, and most people don't even own a landline phone anymore. 
Bitcoins would be safe but unusable with no net connection, but then again, bitcoiners are more likely to be using mesh networking than the average person too, meaning we'll have the net that can't be taken down first.

The whole point is that what they "agree to" is temporary. The truth is eternal. 
You're probably thinking that such facts won't save the dictator of the month from stealing Miguel's property right now, but Miguel will own that property in the eyes of the world if it's been put on the blockchain by the previous owner. 
That doesn't mean Miguel has the power to steal it back now, but he'll get it back one day, when the local, temporary problem has been dealt with... 
Oh, and look, there's a ton of proof now on a blockchain that this particular dictator has been committing a lot of human rights violations... Proof they can take to UN.

No one denies that it's technically possible. For that matter, we've literally already had thousands of alt-bitcoin chains already until miners abandoned those shortforks. 
The difference is obviously people, and if half of the people decided that they don't like the way bitcoin is turning out, and could agree between themselves to support a common build (they certainly haven't with Classic nor XT) then my argument is that they'd be making a Bad deal trading all of that value in bitcoin we have today for whatever it is they'll wind up with.
The market cap will go from $10 billion for the one chain down to $1 billion or even less for the sum of both chains within a day, because of the psychological problems I spoke of. What a clusterf*ck.
The two coins would both survive, no doubt, but the rest of the world would feel VERY vindicated that cryptocurrencies are toys and not to be taken seriously. Merchants would all leave, services like bitpay and coinbase would be out of business overnight, and we would basically be set back a decade or more.

There has to be a way for them to Earn it when they can't earn money elsewhere.

* 1: None are concise that I've seen. It's something that has eluded us so far, so good luck to you on that.
* 2: In a nutshell, they are exactly like Intranets, with all of the security problems that come with those. Watch Andreas Antonopoulos' "Bubble Boy and the Sewer Rat" speech. It's on YT.   
* 3: Bitcoin is immutable because there is nothing you can do to remove data from the blockchain. Once something is recorded there, your great grandkids and maybe even the next intelligent life forms that arise on Earth will be able to read it, without even one character changed.
That's especially important in a world where governments have always muddled with the history books and basically refuse to live with the consequences of their own actions... Especially with monetary policy.
* 4: PoW is the first electronic consensus mechanism to use something scarce as the underlying unit of consensus. The way PoW prevents legit users from coming to agreement about what's on the blockchain is to use that scarcity by way of writing everything to the blockchain with the majority of the total existing computing power. Interfering with the group's consensus takes a whole lot of resources this way, and everything else but processing power online is effortlessly duplicated, so building an economy around them is pointless. This is basically an economics question.
Others like PoS all try to find a way around this use of valuable resources because they all fail to see the value in creating something immutable. They all try to solve different problems but few seem to be able to understand the true value Satoshi did. Just ignore them; they're all unimaginative noise.

If you want to get all technical about it, bitcoin itself has opcodes that allow it to do things like wait until the right time to execute and of course not unlock for fewer than X of Y keys.

Different cards do it in different ways; I believe Xapo, which can't be shipped to the USA but can be spent here, does it the way you want, holding bitcoin but converting at PoS.  A drawback to that system is that some items like the gas pump that need pre-authorization of a certain amount of $ would likely fail, since there is no reserve of dollars there. Also, you probably don't get a bank account and Routing# with any card that holds btc... You do with Bitpay's visa debit for sure, because it basically is a real bank account that lets you load it with bitcoins on demand.
Bitwage will send any US paycheck to any bitcoin wallet address that you want automatically; you've got some reading to do but it sounds like your ideal system is available now.
Good luck.

There are several killer apps on the horizon that could make using bitcoin necessary for the average redditor in the next year or two.
I'm betting Brave browser will be a big one, and I still hold hope for OpenBazaar to grow immensely to the point where everyone has it on their business cards, but that will take time. 
Code Valley and other initiatives to bring freelancers and other net workers into a jobs market that doesn't exist otherwise could be huge too.
But first and foremost, bitcoin will continue to grow, slowly but surely, in all the places you can't use national fiat currency to do what you want to do. That includes far more than just drugs and prostitution; any market can be a black market somewhere, and there's always at least one country like Venezuela that makes using their own currency a nightmare.

First of all, banks are NOT allergic to bitcoin for any reason close to it being used for ransomware and Crime. Their product, the USD and other fiat currencies, are used for 99.99999999% of the worlds ransomware and crime.
Secondly, They have instituted draconian KYC policies as a tool to retain their product's monopoly.
Thirdly, Yes, we should most certainly claim it's worth the price. If a tool could only be used to kill people, then you'd have something to talk about here... But bitcoin could be used MUCH more to help people, such as the unbanked, removing remittance fees, etc...

You're overcomplicating it. 
Simply get a great hard wallet solution like Trezor or KeepKey, perhaps the Ledger Nano S., and receive all income to it. That is your storage/savings/safest place.
For privacy, use as many different public addresses as you can or switch out the biggest one as often as you can.
You MIGHT need a web or mobile wallet to pay for something else in bitcoin every other blue moon, but the fact is that 99% of your spending will still be done in fiat. Sorry, that's the world we live in for now.
So your only concern at that point is changing btc back to fiat when needed.
I can't stress enough how important bitcoin debit cards like the Shift or Bitpay's card are for this crucial role. u/Bitcoin_forever won't agree because he lives in a fantasy world, but this is the vital step to living on bitcoin.
They're important because they act like a fiat bank account, and let you change your coins to fiat at the drop of a hat, **skipping the 4-5 business day wait for Fiat to process at a bank.** 
That means that if you're at the store and don't have enough fiat to make that purchase, you can move coins to your card and spend it in a confirmation or three, depending on your card...
Otherwise you wait until next freaking week to be able to spend any more cash. 
If you want to stick anything in a fireproof safe, just stick your hardware wallet's seed in there and skip the paper wallets. That's a huge, unnecessary complication.

You are simply falling for ChainAnchor's propaganda.
In ChainAnchor's slideshow, still published today, it was ChainAnchor who says that it "Can be overlayed atop Bitcoin."
In the January version of the whitepaper that Todd preserved, the introduction states that their architecture “adds an identity and privacy-preserving layer above the blockchain, either the private blockchain or the public Blockchain in Bitcoin.”
Since then they've removed that reference. In fact that very document went from 85 mentions of bitcoin down to four.
Even without any of this, the fact is that ChainAnchor describes a perfectly legitimate attack vector that may work to harm bitcoin if used on bitcoin miners. (Basically bribing them to play favorites with AML-friendly transactions.)  That's all they needed to do, is just propose those words out loud, and they're instantly attacking bitcoin in my book.
Todd's doing what he always does. Read his blog, he's pointed out lots of vulnerabilities against bitcoin over the years.

They _may_ be guilty of insider trading during that last major BCH pump when they listed BCH on their exchange. The problem is that that may not ever be an actual 'crime' on the US lawbooks. The laws aren't very clear in that area so they may be allowed to pump and dump new cryptos all they want with unlimited insider trading. 
This isn't really even why people around here are mad at them though. Conbase consistently does things to harm the growth of bitcoin. Daily. Probably hourly, in fact. It was already crappy of them to be the biggest company around without hiring someone on staff that works on Bitcoin itself fulltime. Lots of smaller companies do that, but they refuse.
Then there is all the investment in Ethereum and cryptokitties and non-bitcoin assets... Brian literally can't shut up about them while his company's core product has always been bitcoin.... Which he never tweets about except to insult or degrade in some way.
 
By refusing to implement segwit and batch transactions he's literally the cause of all his complaints at this point. Yet he won't say anything about that but "we're working on it." -After being pushed hard. 
The company's position during the Segwit2x scandal was clear; they were among the top leaders of a Coup to overthrow the bitcoin developers and replace Bitcoin as you know it with a Jeff Garzik-controlled clone with bigger blocks. 
Then the BCH listing... Besides the insider trading that was pretty obvious to all, the listing was done in such a way as to pump the hell out of it's price, and meanwhile not allow anyone to sell BCH for BTC. We were all waiting and drooling for the chance to offload our BCH but they simply never allowed that. It took an event that should have dropped BCH's price down to $10 and spread it out over weeks as people slowly moved their BCH to other exchanges and traded them at their own rate. 
Dirty, dirty pool. 
This company needs to go down, asap. It's up to the decentralized exchanges now to get big and smooth fast enough to get to the point where we can replace Coinbase with something like Bisq, even for newbies.
That's the only way Bitcoin can be free of this type of problem.

It's simple. LN can't scale infinitely, and to deploy it, it takes time away from talented coders who should be developing a solution that does.
Meanwhile, sidechains do far more than allow scaling infinitely... You can use sidechains specialized for any use and of any design or security model to hold bitcoin's value.
Sidechains both make bitcoin more durable and more useful.

Lightning scales really big... Although estimates have been made of needing block sizes as large as 8MB-20MB to handle all of the on-chain TXs for a global, everyone-uses-bitcoin-through-lightning-daily adoption, even that is highly speculative because we can't know how much people will prefer to use LN wallets.  It's possible that they might not have a User Interface simple enough for 1% of the world to bother with them, but it's also possible that their UI is so clean and easy to use that no money on earth is as simple to use as bitcoin at that point and the whole world switches to LN bitcoin within days.

Absolutely. The only users that see the amounts and bitcoin addresses inside a node channel are the people at either end of that channel. They're very private to the rest of the world. Of course the recipient of your funds on the other end of that channel could still publish that information if they have some KYC to follow or something.

Your idea of a storage of value is flawed. You assume buying in recently is the only benchmark worth preserving, but if you bought in under $1 then bitcoin has predictably grown ever since and made you FAR more happy using it as a SoV than anything else on this planet could.
Having hodled for years, I can't even fathom holding the majority of my wealth in anything other than bitcoin... Everything but bitcoin sounds like a TERRIBLE store of value to me.
I agree, of course, that someone who bought in since December would feel differently... But then it's just a matter of time until they're in the same boat as me.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:11:36
That seems to be the weakest link; a Lightning node has to be online with your 'open bar tab' for the network to see... People who run bitcoin nodes typically do so with a very high rate of uptime though; so there's no reason to believe LN nodes will have more downtime in general. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:25:12
I'm guessing it's just waiting for a little more infrastructure, like some solid LN wallets, and one really visible piece of big news like a successful lightning implementation by a big name company (microsoft?) to trigger the jump.
Before then it'll probably stay between $9500 and $14500
After the press loves bitcoin again due to the new big news and sees it pass $20k (sees the new ATH) it could go to $55k pretty quick.
Or not. Just my 2 bits.

Think of it like adding another Hot wallet to your phone or desktop. If you wanted to load that new wallet and use it, it's exactly the same thing... A TX to fill it, a TX to empty it. -The difference is that this particular new hot wallet lets you make very fast and cheap payments while it's not empty.
So it's "as tied up" as it would be by simply using that coin in a new wallet today.

We've waited a loooooooooong time for RSK to launch. Like 3 years now, in fact.
Ethereum code can be run on it but with better security of environment and better security of money. This should make most Dapps using ethereum today look really hard about switching to RSK, at least once it has proven itself a bit.
Meanwhile, RSK can actually help with Bitcoin scaling a bit too... It won't happen on day 1, but apps can be made on RSK with really high transaction speeds and bitcoin's transactions can be ported over there for TXs of up to 2000 TPS... At least while using the RSK wallet(s).

LOL! You're basically arguing that if your bank offered you two savings accounts, one that pays no interest and the other that pays between 1% and 2000%  annually, You'd pick the one with no interest. 
The hodlrs here like myself have all been choosing that second account for years, even knowing that the 1% could be as low as -10% like it was in 2014. We're all long-term hodlrs though, and knew 2014's loss would be swallowed by the next few years gains, which in the long game, it never really made a dent in.  


Bitcoin is simply better than gold in every way. It's a better store of value for sure. (Yes, gold has Certainly fallen more than 10% before and has had many down Decades!) It's Better than gold at not rotting or corroding. (durability) It's better than gold at scarcity. It's better than gold at malleability, at recognizability, (Because of the different purities) at portability, (it's in the freaking cloud) and even fungibility. 
*There simply are no aspects that make gold a store of value that Bitcoin doesn't do better.*

Offline: yes. 
Indefinitely? The problem here is that the other end of the channel will have to close one day. Maybe soon, maybe in years, but you don't have control over that, only your end. - So it's not perfect for long-term storage.

The most common way to use a Bitcoin ATM is to start by downloading a wallet app on your phone, and then using the machine to trade dollars or whatever you have for bitcoins that this machine sends to your phone's wallet.
They work a little differently from each other, however, so I can't say if your phone will be scanning the ATM's screen or if the ATM will print out a piece of paper for you to scan in later... Either way the point is for the ATM to send bitcoins to your own wallet's address in some way.

Although I'm not even tempted one bit to follow, It makes perfect sense why people would be feeling like this right now, before the Lightning Network gets a chance to take us back to Bitcoin's glory days full of hope and promise. It's like we've been stuck for the last year in a depressing political argument, while the mempool grew and the use cases for bitcoin dwindled... Many attracted to bitcoin's promise to free the world's money and lift up the poor can no longer see it doing that because of the setback in scaling.
Give it 6 months and check back in for that hope we're all missing... Once LN reduces fees and friction we should regain a ton of that hope and excitement we had for years.

There are two groups that could be:
* Investors in BTC who care about privacy. (Don't want the IRS to see their coins, or want to keep their stash hidden from thieves.) 
* Drug BUYERS who scrounged all that money together from their friends to go and buy a bunch of stuff online with.
Drug sellers wouldn't need to use the ATM to buy anything at all... They get all their coins from the marketplace and are only looking for anonymous places where they can turn cryptocurrency into dollars... The opposite of what you're seeing.
Bitcoin ATMs do exist that sell dollars for bitcoins, but they have so many Identification requirements and high fees on them that no one really uses them for this purpose.

If you do not have a channel open already, but you owed me a millibit, then you have to open a channel... But not one just to me, and not just for the transaction... A more permanent channel.
When you first get your LN wallet, you'll probably load your channel right then and there, one time, connecting to some hub like an exchange or perhaps the wallet manufacturer. The money you put into that channel is, for all intents and purposes, exactly like the money you put into a new bitcoin wallet. (Just with lower fees and instant transactions.)
You therefore wouldn't have to think of opening a channel to me, ever. You'd simply send me a millibit of your LN wallet's balance to me.

The ideal way is to hodl them until they can be used directly on everything you might want. With the lightning Network coming out this year it's closer than ever to the point where you'd be able to pay for everything in bitcoin directly.
If you're familiar with the theory of Hyperbitcoinzation, it shouldn't be too long after that when other currencies, eventually including the dollar, start being 'absorbed' by bitcoin, until there is nothing left but cryptocurrencies or even just bitcoin. If that happens, it would be obvious how you use it... It would be the only money around.

Hodling is something you learn to do naturally after you have spent some and then later regret that $15 meal could have been an extra $100,000 worth of BTC if you had just kept it. Oops.
In time, everyone becomes a hodler because that shit hurts.
While it may be true that some amount of spending is need for us to launch bitcoin into the payments world, that doesn't mean bitcoin can't grow without being a successful payment network. 
Look at right now: the fees are too damn high for coffee and meals. It's ludicrous to use bitcoin for small purposes now, and has been for the last year. Is bitcoin shrinking?
The fact is that being a store of value is a very important function. Bank accounts, Gold, CDs, 401ks, savings bonds, IRAs, offshore accounts, pensions, even jewelry, all have the very important utility of being a holder of our value, and the more that value grows, the better. That's being a store of value.
Bitcoin is asserting itself as the best store of value mankind has ever seen. It's accessible from anywhere, Crosses borders like no one else can, and tends to grown in value at record rates.
Embrace the store of value functionality for now, and the payment network functionality can come later, with Lightning, sidechains, and many other higher-layer networks.

There is actually quite a lot of reason to think it is Undervalued. Look at bitcoin's price on a log chart, for instance. It's nowhere near the top of its' trading range yet.
Secondly, consider what assets bitcoin is taking the place of in society, and figure out how large it's market cap would have to be to match those... For instance, Gold alone is a $9 Trillion market, but Bitcoin's is only $300 billion... So if it only takes 10% of the gold market away (Which any gold dealer today will tell you it is already doing) then Bitcoin's market cap should go to $900 billion.
But we're using bitcoin for so much more than just a gold replacement! How many bitcoiners have 401ks, IRAs, Savings accounts, pensions, and all of the other vaious ways to store money in a way they hope will grow?
We may be looking at the first asset worth an eventual Quadrillion dollars. So, what % of that are we?

The adoption of Censorship-resistant money is an insane game.
There is a history before Bitcoin was launched of many different types of internet money that attempted to launch first. Paypal was even one of them; Musk and Thiel often say they were trying to make the Bitcoin of their day but they were forced by regulations to 'sell out.' 
Better attempts like eGold still found their creators in prison when trying to be censorship resistant. Governments simply do not like allowing other money to be used in their country... It undermines their monopoly on the money supply, which undermines their ability to print money at will.
All Cypherpunks everywhere know this and have been working for a way around this problem since the early 1990's. Censorship-resistant money is the holy grail of cypherpunkdom and Satoshi and other people involved in Bitcoin's genesis were obvious cypherpunks.
Therefore, keeping bitcoin censorship resistant is job  in bitcoin development. That means decentralization... Keep the node count high and the ability to download a node, even behind the lines of extreme regimes like North Korea and Venezuela, is all-important. 
Literally, there is nothing more important in bitcoin, and this ability gives Bitcoin its value. You could say that this is what "Backs" a bitcoin.
Devs have known since Satoshi first said so; if you make nodes too expensive for everyone to run when they want, the only bitcoin nodes will exist in server farms and run by governments or big corporations that do whatever governments say.
It wouldn't be censorship resistant at all anymore in that scenario, hence why the devs won't even stop to give this possibility any thought at all.

You're overlooking the fact that once the LN is deployed, and Bitcoin is shown to make cheap transactions again, people will be monetarily incentivized to move away from their current wallets, over to BitGo, Samourai, and other wallets that have already deployed SegWit and will quickly deploy LN nodes.

It has to encourage a market to form where people who want something (advertisers, in this case) pay in bitcoin (hopefully through some off-blockchain system like Taringa! and many others use) to those who want to earn bitcoin.
Sure, it's certainly harder to jump-start such an economy. Advertisers don't have proven numbers yet worth paying for and users don't have their friends onboard yet, so they can't pump up the advertiser's numbers.
However, when you don't climb this ladder, bypassing bitcoin for an altcoin that you can issue, you basically have to fight the network effect of bitcoin too... So whatever gains there are in attracting users with free tokens like Steem did limits your currency to never be truly useful to its users. The best they can do is sell it at an exchange for bitcoin.

Likewise, everyone who accepts bitcoin is either stacking or just doing so as a publicity stunt... And therefore no economy is anywhere near forming.
In 2014 I closed the directory without ever making a sale. Spent a good bit of my bitcoin stash on the endeavor, too. It all taught me that hodling is the only way forward; we need to spend some time making the asset valuable first before anyone's going to ever use it as money.

The thing about bitcoin's price that has been obvious since even before the 2013 big move was that after a spike it never returns all the way down to where it was before the spike, usually settling around 2x to 5x higher than where it started from. This has now been demonstrated a half dozen times and frankly I just can't take anyone serious anymore who believes bitcoin's price could fall as low as it was before the last pump to ATH started.
Unfortunately, that includes pretty much everyone who hasn't been hodling bitcoin for a while now... So, about 6.5 Billion people.

There are many, many different ways a centralized service can screw you. Coinbases' fees alone make people pull out their hair on a daily basis. 
Being "backed" by a federal guarantee means nothing in certain situations, like if they disagree with you on the fate of your money! Also, who knows if you will personally be taken care of if they disappear in the middle of the night like countless other exchanges have... They're probably insured up to a certain dollar amount and since bitcoin keeps rising in value, that amount is likely surpassed as soon as they add more insurance on.
If you don't want to spring the $0 or so for a hardware wallet than at least set some of your savings aside in a paper wallet and hide it very well.

I'm very happy about the mining power costs situation. It costs a lot more energy to mine Gold each year, and even just the holiday lighting in the US each year still outpaces mining by a longshot.
Even still, you must keep in mind what the energy is being used for... It's the very security of Bitcoin's network itself, keeping bitcoin from being a crappy alt that no one can put their savings into.
Try to imagine for a second how much electricity is spent to do the same purpose for the Dollar. All the banks, security systems, computer networks for their IT systems, all the armed guards and vaults and armored cars and everything else they use... That's just the start of it... You'd also need to include several government departments like the Secret Service to protect it and the Federal reserve banking system to plan/issue/coordinate it. How many trees do then cut down to print it? How many human lives are lost each year actually defending it during robberies?
Bitcoin needs NONE of that. Just some mining, that's all. 
If we replace just the dollar (much less all the other currencies and stores of value around the world like Gold) with bitcoin, making sure that Bitcoin can function with a similar or better level of security, Bitcoin miners will literally be using a tiny, tiny fraction of the electricity that is used today to keep the dollar working.

It's not the truth, because you're confusing value storage with generating money in some form of risky investment. 
Storage of value is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme. We all use and need to store our value daily. Standards of value storage have sunken to all-time lows lately with negative interest rates and quantative easing being the norm nowadays. They also aren't convenient as we'd like. (I.E. banking hours, fees, poor security)
Bitcoin is simply a superior storage of value because not only is it convenient, but the stuff we can buy with our bitcoins is literally growing while everything else out there is doing the opposite.

It easy to think this way when Bitcoin hasn't scaled yet nor added privacy layers, but since we know these things are doable, the future is certain; Bitcoin will certainly be a more desirable money than any fiat could be once those are rolled out and everyone can have cheap, instant transactions anywhere in the world without permission. You can't do that with fiat.

Mining electricity does go higher, but it has nothing to do with how many people are using Bitcoin... Miners are in a constant competition with each other and use electricity more and more efficiently over time as the hardware gets designed better and better over time.
However, more miners are constantly coming in, and typically that rate of new miners is growing electric use faster than hardware improvements can cut down on it... So it is growing, but not as fast as new users adopting bitcoin grows.

Yep, It won't be listed on CMC until it exists and has a market the CMC guys can verify... Maduro has made sure that nobody is going to verify petro's markets by announcing that it's only for sale at some exchanges for legacy securities that his government oversees. 
Theoretically, of course, a Fiat-backed govt crypto PoS system can work, as can a central-bank issued PoS crypto that doesn't even need to be backed by anything. Governments are just fine with buying lots of servers and distributing them around to ensure their 'masternodes' or whatever are spread around and hard to attack. It's not real decentralization, but it's probably good-enough protection from attackers of the network.
Their problems, however, begin the second their coin trades for other cryptocurrencies... And it's a doozy... They fear this outcome more than hyperinflation. Once a nation puts its crypto up for sale in a market where other cryptocurrencies can be traded for it, they've opened their money supply up to huge speculative attack risks... By whales and even by other nations. There really is no way to defend your nation's money supply from someone with a lot more value in crypto out there liquid for trade shorting your coin. The only way around that is to not let it trade for other crypto, and the best way to do that is to simply not make a cryptocurrency in the first place.

If paper wallets were so safe, we'd all be using them, right? Actually, they kinda suck.
Paper wallets have far more attack vectors than a ledger or Trezor do. Maybe twice as many. Most importantly, a paper wallet is no safer than the software wallet you use to redeem it with, which will very likely be putting those private keys on an internet-connected device. Hardware wallets don't do that at all.
Heck, some termites or silverfish are probably a serious threat to most cold wallet keepers. Certainly fire and physical theft are going to ensure your paper wallets are compromised... Not so with most hardware wallets.

The raising of block sizes requires higher priced nodes in several different ways, including:
* Requiring more bandwidth
* Requiring more RAM
* Requiring more Hard drive space 
From one to two megs is no biggie. From two to four, (which is what we'd have with 2MB max block size plus Segwit) would start to make a dent in the number of people who run nodes... Maybe cutting them down by half or more.
It's the next step up that really slays nodecount. An 8MB max block size plus Segwit would allow 16MB blocks and that could make it seriously prohibitively expensive to run your own full node. Bitcoin wouldn't be permissionless for the average guy anymore; sure you could use coinbase all you want but you couldn't be in control of your own money without spending a ton on a computer and internet connection to keep your node up.
Meanwhile, what we needs is closer to 1 Terabyte blocks for global adoption. Raising the blocksize a notch is akin to putting a bandaid on a crumbling hoover dam.

So... I'm for a:
* 2MB blocksize now,
* SegWit when Available
* Maybe even a 4MB blocksize in a few years from now if needed at the time to delay longer...
* Finally implement something that 95% of bitcoiners agree on. Something like a perfected Sidechain system.

I'm not convinced that they gained all that much power, but I can tell you exactly what it was that convinced the world that they did have some:
It was nothing other than viewing the size of that incredibly huge crowd from above.
The masses will believe just about anything that they see with their own eyes, even if just on TV. If they see a crowd of 1 million unshaven hippies but don't see the crowd of people against those hippies, suddenly, in all of the viewer's minds, the hippies are the larger group.
It's as simple as that.
The Ron Paul campaign gathered those kinds of crowds in one place several times, but the media knew this tactic well and had a complete blackout around them, multiple times, and to this day the only way to see those pictures of the convincingly-huge crowds is to find pics of them online, taken by people who were in attendance.... In the days before drones.
I mention the drones because this is a major advantage we have today that we didn't have before. You can get an aerial view of the large crowd in HD even, so everyone fits in the screen. That's probably the most important weapon of our day.

I can't believe it's 2018 and there are still people who believe in Bitcoin, but think global adoption requires global adoption of the payment system. (As opposed to global adoption of bitcoin as an asset/store of value.)
Sit back kiddos and let me tell you my story about how I believed the same until 2013. 
My username here, Coinosphere, is taken from the first big merchant directory for bitcoin, which I launched in 2013. 
Up until then all merchant directories were run by big processors like bitpay and coinbase, only showcasing merchants on their own platform, so I took the active approach and skimmed the web to find every business online that accepted bitcoin, listing them all on my site. By the end I had over 20,000 Merchants listed, although I doubt more than 5% of them were ready to actually accept bitcoin if you walked in with some.
I didn't charge anything for people to use the site, but I did offer merchants a promotional upgrade that made them stand out visually. It costs a whopping $5, so I wasn't trying to do anything but pay the server bills with that income. 
After nearly a year of absolutely zero sales, Through the 2013 hype cycle no less, I came to learn the hard way that the only spenders of bitcoin are the true evangelists, and they quickly ran out of bitcoin during bull markets that they couldn't afford to replace. 
Others just couldn't be bothered to replace it, even if they have the cash. Everyone in the world who spends bitcoin is soon out of bitcoin because it's basically too much trouble to replace what we spend often. Likewise, everyone who accepts bitcoin is either stacking or just doing so as a publicity stunt... And therefore no economy for bitcoins used as a payment method is anywhere near forming.
People sure do love stacking coins though. We hodlers of last resort are legion.
In 2014 I closed Coinosphere without ever making a sale. I spent a good bit of my bitcoin stash on the endeavor, too, and don't have as many coins to my name today because of it. This all taught me that hodling is the only way forward; we need to spend some time making the asset valuable first before anyone's going to ever use it as money.
Any why wouldn't that be the normal way money works? If you've ever scoffed at accepting someone's altcoin instead of bitcoin for a trade you understand already that no one wants a worthless thing in trade. Gold could never have become money before it became a valuable asset, and neither will bitcoin.
So just hodl and give it time. The payment method might be desirable in the next decade or even next century, but for now bitcoin's use is as a store of value that can't be censored/confiscated and that is AWESOME. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:53:43
There are two ways anything gets adopted:
1. Most companies implement it and we can use it anywhere.
2. Some companies implement it and we all go use those companies' services, leaving behind the ones that don't implement it.
With Segwit alone, the need wasn't great for us to go do  It's a minuscule gain that is socialized among all users.
With lightning Network, it is indeed a great big gain that saves you money at the moment you use it.
We'll all benefit immediately to leave bad actors like Coinbase and use a wallet like BitGo or Samourai that has already implemented segwit and will very quickly let us open up a Lightning Channel.
I think LN will be, in fact, the Killer App for Segwit and get it adopted very quickly once the big companies realize they're losing customers over this.

Bakkt is important in that it's a mainstream version of the Lightning Network already supported by the top markets and corps in the world. It could literally get bitcoin accepted in every starbucks one day, even before the LN is able to handle that kind of volume.
Yes, they're centralized and yes, we all prefer for the LN to take off than used bakkt... But the thing is, another channel like this, centralized or not, added on top of the LN makes bitcoin's 2nd layer even more decentralized than it is with just the LN.
Besides, in any future competition between the two, LN is far cheaper and more private so bakkt can't win in the end.

The R3 chain won't be a public chain though. It'll be a big intranet that their banking partners alone will be using together. That means the safety of an intranet instead of the blockchain... Lol; that oughtta last long.
And even if safety were to be acceptable somehow, being an intranet means there are no actual benefits... Customers would be using the same old fiat in the same old ways, no programmable money, no microtransactions, no borderless innovation, no github filled with 4,000+  developers adding to it whenever they have an idea, basically nothing that anyone likes about bitcoin.
The two just aren't in competition. At best, R3 is going to lower costs of banks internally without changing what banks can do from the customer's point of view, and frankly that's just not good enough for 2016.

If you're not treating it like a commodity, then you have no reason to be hodling at all. 
But yes, everyone DOES want it to be the best payment network too. Money needs to be both a Store of Value and a Payment Network or it's not good money and can't win the fight against the dollar one day.
The thing is, Store of Value is simply MUCH harder and more important to protect, and the popularity of bitcoin since 2016 has been growing off the charts and it's impossible for devs to protect both without Layer 2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network. So the devs are opting to protect store of value when they don't raise the block size. There are very good technical reasons to do so.
As for the economic argument, the Austrian school of economics professes an explanation of how money is created that puts the Store of Value aspect at the genesis of money. A good money absolutely has to be a store of value first before it can add a payment network. It also takes a lot of time and effort, decades or centuries  historically, for people to build up trust in a currency's store of value property. Meanwhile the payment network can come and go like the seasons. We can hot-swap out new payment networks 7 days a week until we get that part right, but the value storage is something that once you lose, you never get back.

Greece is a different animal from Argentina and Venezuela, because Greeks are holding Euros, not the currency that their broke government itself has the power to print into toiletpaperdom. -In those cases the volatility of Bitcoin is absolutely superior to that of their local currency, so it's a no-brainer for people not able to buy euros or dollars.
However, in Greece's case, the banks are going to lose so many customers that branches are simply going to close down all over the country, and it will revert to a cash-only economy where the Euro is everywhere but not a convenient solution for doing things like buy stuff online or even use automatic deposit.
So those people who think bitcoin will save them from hyperinflation are not thinking it through, because Greece still has plenty of Euro bills floating around inside its' borders... But money just won't flow well enough for most greeks, so a 2nd currency, especially one that acts like a bank account, should be a very welcome solution and hopefully this crunch will help the greeks appreciate bitcoin in the long run.

1. Start with tons of Youtube videos first, then devour bitcoin.org, then this subreddit, then news sites like coindesk/BraveNewCoin/Cointelegraph. Bitcointalk is impossible to find anything in, scary for noobs.
2. No. Mining is for multi-million dollar corporations now. You're too late on that one.
3. It's extremely productive; Mining has created a level of security that no robber, no hacker, no corporation, and possibly no government on the planet can overcome. If that still doesn't impress you, then imagine how much energy, money, and manpower (and how many industries exist to support) the existing financial system. Think about every bank branch, every armored van, every security guard, every wire service, etc... Bitcoin will eventually replace ALL of that, and more. They just can't compete with something so efficient. 
4. Seriously, the whitepaper isn't that hard to grasp. Do yourself a huge favor and just try hard to get through it's 9 pages here:

Like the others say, bitcoin is the incentive that makes the blockchain work. It can be separated from the blockchain about as well as your head can be separated from your body. But there's even more to it than that...
They'll be putting a lot of transactions on the blockchain each day or even hour.
Let's say Nasdaq enables 10,000 blockchain transactions a day. If their securities are assigned to a colored satoshi each, then that's only 10 bits per day in bitcoin they have to send around... OFF chain. 
-But if they do it off-chain they don't need bitcoin like they say they do; they can just use a centralized database and post their daily trades to a proofofexistence service far easier.
So that means they'll likely be paying miners fees.
10,000 x average miners fees of 0.0002 btc each is... Two whole coins every day. Still not a lot of price pressure moving two coins around constantly, but it will certainly add to the network and give miners more reason to mine and give developers more reason to strengthen the network, by far.
I, for one, look forward to this. Bitcoin is Antifragile and will be far better off for it.

Um, not money related... Sheesh.
The US government’s visa system, crippled by a technical glitch, will not be back up and running until next week, forcing thousands of business travellers and others to postpone or cancel travel plans.
The State department said a hardware failure on June 9 was preventing it from processing and transmitting the mandatory, security-related biometric data checks routinely carried out at embassies and consulates.
“This is a global issue and we’re working around the clock to fix it,” said John Kirby, a State department spokesman. No evidence indicated that the problem was related to cyber security.
But Mr Kirby said he did not expect the system to be back “online before next week. I can’t give you any more specific detail with respect to timing on that.”
The glitch is having a knock-on affect for those people who have already submitted their documents because their passports have become locked up in the system.
Documents are normally returned within four to five working days. But after the system went down applicants who needed their passports for other foreign travel have struggled to retrieve their documents.
A spokeswoman for the US embassy in London confirmed that they were being “overwhelmed” with requests from applicants for their passports to be returned.
“It is most definitely an issue and regrettable,” she said, adding that the consular section was dealing with “over 500 email requests a day” from applicants requesting that their documents be returned.
She urged anyone affected, who needed their passports for other travel, to fill out the visa contact form on their respective embassy’s website.
She said that if people ticked the box entitled “my inquiry concerns non-immigrant visas and is not covered by your website” and also stated the type of visa they had applied for “we will do our best to reply”. But she warned that “we are trying to manage expectations and get back to people when we can, but in some cases it just isn’t possible”.
She also cautioned that anyone who had their passport returned would “likely have to start any visa application process over again”.
US diplomatic missions handle an average of 50,000 visa applications a day. Overseas and domestic passports were still being issued normally.
“Domestic passport operations are functioning, with some intermittent processing delays. While some of these issues have affected same-day service at our passport agencies, we continue to issue passports to US citizens with urgent overseas travel needs,” the department said.
This is the second technical glitch to hit the US visa system since last year, when a data-processing system failed last July, stranding thousands of business people, foreign workers and athletes who had planned travel to the US.
The State department said it was prioritising visa applications for temporary agricultural workers and in urgent humanitarian cases, and would clear the backlog of pending visa cases as soon as possible.
“We regret the inconvenience to travellers and recognise that this is causing hardship to those waiting for visas, and in some cases, their family members or employers in the US,” the department said.

100mb blocks? Wow... I assure you no computer you've ever touched can handle such a blockchain when full. 16mb is really scary; maybe impossible to do with today's internet limitations. 
You can't think of on-chain scaling as how many megabytes can your hard drive fit... HD space is actually the 4th-most important restriction to on-chain scaling. The other three are:
 
1) Propagation times 
2) Bandwidth costs
3) RAM usage 
As blocks get bigger, it takes more time for them to reach their destination in full. Therefore more data has to be downloaded to nodes and miners, and the power of reading those larger UXTO sets becomes greater and greater. Prpagation times become so long that it's time to look at the next block when you're still waiting for the last block's UXTO to download. Bandwidth becomes very expensive because of all the extra downloading you have to do to run a node. (Google Fiber's 1GB connection isn't enough at 16 MB) Worse yet, motherboards have a limit (128GB today) of how much RAM you can fit on them, which we surpass at somewhere inbettween 16 and 32 MBs in size. Then Disk space gets expensive too, although there is such a thing as Pruning now.
Even if you think my numbers sound too low, please keep in mind that even at 32mb, or heck, even at 128 MB per block, the goal is still so far away we might as well give up today. Scaling to mainstream-level payments would require TERRABYTE blocks, nothing less. Thousands of times larger yet. On-chain is strictly a temp patch only, and not one that will last very long.
Devs have known since around 2012 that scaling on-chain just won't work for this reason... And have been focused on layer-2 scaling ever since.

Actually, Bitcoin is seen as more legit by the mainstream in Australia than most anywhere else. 
It really caught a lucky break in Oz back in 2015 or thereabouts when the national postal service turned into blockchain's biggest fan and they helped legitimize BTC to the whole country. Shortly following that it became super easy to buy bitcoin with cash and without paying much in fees across the country using Blueshyft kiosks. (
The big banks didn't react well and tried to shut down fiat access to the exchanges there too, which was stopped by the government. All of these things taken together simply make Oz one of the most 'legitimized' countries in the world for cryptocurrencies.

That was not what I got out of it at all. For a banker, this was anything but the standard "Blockchain good, bitcoin bad" argument that has been present 100% of the time so far.
Some takeaways from Batlin and the article describing his comments:
* His opinion on what made bitcoin so special appears to be that it offers a “disintermediation of trust,” by cutting out the middlemen in financial transactions.
* He titled his latest post: "Crypto 2.0 Musings - Bitcoin Supremacy" (In which he did not say it won't be supreme)
* “I looked through Bitcoin’s technical issues I have been capturing since January and came to the conclusion that all of them will be solved in due time”
* He then makes the case that it is likely that the world’s unbanked, all 2.5 Billion of them, will adopt bitcoin due to a lack of alternatives. If so, he reasons, the whole world might follow.
* “No need to open bank accounts or deal with VISA, PayPal etc. Imagine if just half of the unbanked started using Bitcoin - would the rest of the world be able to resist it?”
* “Bitcoin avoids centralised control of money supply by...” 
*  “Bitcoin’s gold standard fixed supply approach appears to be the right one, as it removes banker’s risk from the economy” 
* “So, fiat currencies are not like bitcoin, they are actually bank deposit IOUs linked to fiat currencies and are banker’s confidence in state’s ability to entangle society into a promise of work and asset’s ability to hold value"

There's SO much more you can do with information than just pirate whatever happens to be handy.
This opens up information that wouldn't normally be online, because now there is an incentive to Put it online.
Speeds would go way up because there are so many more seeded copies waiting for you, you'd always be able to find whatever rare thing you're looking for, and Artists can bypass their record labels and sell directly over bittorrent.
This is absolutely revolutionary if you think about it.

More volume = less manipulation possible.
Volume is a trait of popularity.
The more popular bitcoin is (and it grows steadily) the less its price can be manipulated.
...Just like every other asset and currency.
So the OP is silly. Following that logic, everything that is above manipulation today was just wished into its' current, popular position without ever starting out small and growing first.

There is no claim in the article that it is a stock; just that O.co applied for the ability to sell stocks.
'The actual thing' is a securized bond transacted across the bitcoin blockchain using colored coins and sold on the t0.com website.
There appear to be 25 of them, going for a cool $1m each. The terms of the bond aren't disclosed yet, so we don't know if they'll be redeemable for cash or coin.
The reason it's not so dependent on people needing colored coins is because these are "Backed" by the full faith of Overstock.com, the issuer of the bonds... Who is likely 'good for it.'

IOUs for gold are good enough for them because of two reasons:
1. It's a major, costly pain to take possession. (Unsafe to store, expensive to move plus, they need more liquidity)
2. There is no benefit to holding physical gold that they care about enough.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, puts gold to shame:
1. Is an inconvenience for them to take possession of, but FAR less painful, and they can stay pretty liquid.
2. There are obvious benefits to holding your own private keys, and eventually everyone will learn through getting burned mtgox-style over and over that letting others keep your private key is never without serious risk... Risk they'll have to factor into their price.

Those with the highest # of "commits" are those that added the most code. People like Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik, and head Dev Wladimir van der Laan all have their Blogs listed there if you click on their usernames.
No one knows what they are talking about more than them... Of course that only applies to the technical side of Bitcoin, not so much the Economics side... Which is constantly up to interpretation.

I'd bet he converts any bcash he gets to bitcoin anyway, he's no moron... But he's often spoken about a future full of altcoins everywhere, one where timmycoin competes with susancoin inside a school and the higher-valued coin gets its owner elected as class president...

I just can't see any way for the incentives to work.
No one is going to pay to put all the Bitcoins in it that would be needed for a good incentive, and no Altcoin you can create will be valuable enough as long as bitcoin exists... So miners will choose to mine bitcoins over this timechaincoin.
If this were some kind of massive BIP that redirected some of the btc from each mined block into it then you'd have something... Otherwise this project just can't be incentivized properly.

Every major game company has thought about it, I assure you.
The biggest issue is simply the scale. If the money is in the game, somehow, it had to get there, so that leaves either the game designers or the players paying for it. 
Either a game must be paid into (meaning nobody who doesn't have bitcoin sitting around already can play, so it's a ghost town) or the game makers must pay them something, even if it's just 100 satoshis, to play.
The problem with the latter is, of course, no one has that much bitcoin to give away when you're talking about  millions of players like WOW has. Then imagine all the bot farmers creating new accounts on autopilot just to get those free satoshis 1,000 every minute each. It's just too expensive without some kind of pay-in, unless we get to the point where Advertisers buy the in-game currency somehow.

You must be joking.
In the usa, the 1% has 40% of all wealth, and the bottom 80% has only 7% of it... And those are old numbers, I believe, it's even worse now.
In BTC, sure Satoshi (who deserves everything we can give him, BTW) and a couple more make up the 1%, but they don't have 40% of all coins! There are 15 million out of 21m now.
Everyone who doesn't have a bitcoin today has a chance to get some of those undistributed 6 Million bitcoins...
Then look at who deserves it. With the USD, wealth is printed up and just handed over to bankers and congress without so much as a thank you. Most of those dollars go to do unspeakable things like drone striking children in countries all around the world.
Meanwhile bitcoins are brought into existence only when someone has done a public service. All new coins pay for us all to have good service, and go to the service provider fairly.

Miners don't like losing money, so even without a majority of the nodes running UASF code, they realized it would hurt their pocketbook directly, as would it also hurt when Bitcoin's apparent integrity would be hurt since some nodes would see some transactions and others do not.
Too much threat of profit loss scared them away, and at the 11th hour they and their CEO buddies called the whole thing off. It worked Exactly as planned.

I can imagine there will be other UASF events in the future, hopefully not as messy as the first one was.  Point being, we shouldn't just call it "UASF Day," which would be confused with future UASF dates that we eventually set. 
How do we shorten "Victory over the battle for Segwit2x" into a catchy holiday name?

It's easy. Roger has always misunderstood and constantly misrepresents the Austrian Economic theory that he claims to support and has quoted incorrectly on occasion.
Being a proper Store of value was an explicit part of the economic origin of bitcoin. The Austrian theory called Menger's Regression theorem explains precisely  where money comes from, and if you listen to Roger tell the story, he'll say that it's really important for money to be a transactional currency first and foremost, not a store of value. (Paypal is more important than gold.) Sadly for all of us, he's always misunderstood this and no one can tell him otherwise because he literally thinks he's the smartest person around. 
The very Austrian economists he quotes did not agree with him at all... You can read it for yourself here:  (Next to last paragraph, it's clear that money has to be a store of value first and foremost.)
Satoshi and many in bitcoin longer than Roger knew this all along and thankfully the devs realized that bitcoin being a store of value is all-important for its success. Just think about it though; if bitcoin goes to $0, another coin could easily overtake it, or faith in cryptocurrencies as a whole could be lost for decades... But if we just lose the payment rails? That's like switching paypal for amex or something... Very minor in comparison. Consumers won't care if bitcoin gets new payment rails... As long as their value stored in the system is safe.

Strictly thinking of human psychological patterns, the one decade milestone really should add a lot more legitimacy to Bitcoin.

No. Fiat exists only by government decree. The word fiat itself is latin, meaning "let it be," as in 'let it be worth what I say it is worth.'

I don't see how you can say BCH has the right to be called Bitcoin too. Bitcoin is more than some code... Bitcoin is defined by: 
* it's code
* it's devs &amp; their repository
* a set of rules (protocol) 
* a blockchain
* a consensus of nodes
* the mining hashrate majority
* a community of users &amp; merchants
* and a market price
...All of which formed around BTC. To say that BCH or any other fork has the right to be called bitcoin when it only has one or two of those things is like saying I have the right to be called President Trump because I have some flippy hair and a huge ego.
If you doubt it, can you tell us why BCH has the right but other forks like BCG and BCD don't?

Most peoples' layer of resistance against bitcoin is actually about the hypey-sounding investment advice. Therefore if they believe that the cool-sounding innovation can be separated from the investment they're scared of, they'll have the time to learn about bitcoin without the automatic resistance layer up first.

Holding money in channels is not very different from holding your cash in a checking account. (Or really  an interest-bearing savings account if you run a node.) It'll be like an available wallet balance, not as tied up as you seem to imagine.
Really got no money in the account yet? It'll receive and hold non-lightning BTC fine too, which the sender of your $10 example would likely use if the fees are low enough at the time. And thanks to all the new tricks they're busily teaching it, it could show up from any lightning-ready altcoins in the account type of your choice, even opening a channel for you seamlessly.

Sounds like most everyone agrees that volatility will hurt them but the fee-lessness will be awesome for them. It also sounds well understood that technically we have solutions to these, although they come with a big learning curve.
I'd suggest someone look into setting up the "poor man's coinbase" to be the perfect volatility-free, fee-free bank for those who can at least afford feature phones. That's gotta be at least 12 Million americans, so surely there can be some kind of profit from this service too.

3 of 5 would be perfect for you, but CoinKite can't sign your tx, as they are not remote signers, just wallet providers.
There is a difference between 2FA and actually being a keyholder/remote signer. 2FA is a method they often use to approving a spend, but Coinkite does not approve anyones' spends.
They do let you use 3rd party signers (Oracles) like Cryptocorp.co. Sadly, I do not think there is an easy way for you to use one yet because Oracles are a brand-spanking-new business type.  Contact them to learn more, of course.
2 of 3, where the wallet holds key  only, (BitGo style) is the best &amp; easiest way you can have a remote signer available today.
Of course you could BE your own remote signer using Coinkite and many others, having one key signed from your cellphone and one from your ipad, etc... But that centralizes the attack, so if someone holds you hostage you'd have all the keys right there for them to steal/force you to use.
I recommend checking out GreenAddress.it first, their setup seems to be the best all-around answer for now.

It's already a great replacement for coinbase and other fiat apps like paypal/venmo. I actually love the app-card interface, and the ease at which you can buy and sell BTC to fiat in the app is second to none. Having a BTC maximalist in charge is very comforting too. 
There are none of Coinbase's huge fees for buying btc, as well.
Sadly, they don't let you send external bitcoins into your account, however. There is no replacement for Bitpay's visa debit card here, for instance.

No, sadly it is not going to happen soon... BUT, there is a secondary gain for us here.
The VAST majority of the planet, almost everyone out there, has been trained to think incorrectly about money. They do not easily jump aboard BTC because it doesn't obviously solve the problem that is in their head when their tellers refuse to give them euros. 
Whenever the press mentions bitcoin in relation to greece, people watching that are starting to make the mental link. It's a teaching tool, and no matter how dissapointed in BTC they get from greece not happily jumping aboard, at least they've been infected with the idea that next time bitcoin is an option.

Just think about it though; if bitcoin goes to $0, another coin could easily overtake it, or faith in cryptocurrencies as a whole could be lost for decades... But if we just lose the payment rails? That's like switching paypal for amex or something... Very minor in comparison. Consumers won't care if bitcoin gets new payment rails... As long as their value stored in the system is safe. 


Ah yes, the old centralized LN myth. Did it ever occur to you that the existing wallets aren't likely to evaporate the day LN goes into full use? Regardless, the LN on mainnet has already proven extremely decentralized and it's already becoming standard for LN wallets to automatically balance channels with lesser-connected nodes to ensure it stays widely connected.


Bitcoin was already a trade-off for them, adding LN to that doesn't create any new tollbooths. (It does give them more fraud protection and instant txs though!)


1. Bitcoin will show them what real fraud protection looks like... It'll necessarily have to grow a bit first before that's apparent.
2. Make up your mind. First you say merchants won't like it, but then you say it gives merchants the upper hand over customers. Sheesh. Again, this is nothing new to bitcoin.

This is the wrong question. Of course the blockchain would be the most ideal way to run an election that mankind has ever considered. It's really perfect for this purpose.
...But how can the results be forced onto our rulers?
Even if we could mathematically prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the majority of citizens in a country voted for someone on the blockchain that did not win the "real" election, there is no reason, no threat of force, no incentive of any kind to persuade the government into doing what the majority voted for them to do.
They certainly don't do what the majority wants them to do now.
To even have a chance at making this workable, you'd have to replace the IRS with a blockchain-based IRS somehow... Make it collect our taxes and pay their salaries outside of their control... Good luck abolishing the IRS first...

Direct quote from:  




But from everything I can see here, it sounds like they're going to use something other than Proof of Work for their blockchain. Perhaps Proof of Stake, which seems like it would work for them, but would clearly be an altcoin.
Coins (blockchain based currency units) of any type that are not bitcoin are altcoins. It's pretty clear we've been lied to unless notes are a fully a separate project from the one quoted above.

Actually, quite a lot of pronsites now accept btc. Adult toys and camsites too. We may be fully "mainstream" there now, but the problem has become that the largest demographic of porn buyers is still trying to hide their habit from their family so doesn't see themselves heading over to an BTM every now and then yet. -In time that demo will get huge all by itself as holding bitcoin is more common.
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:59:59
I'm all for it, and wish them luck, but there are quite a few other things that offer the consumer a benefit for using bitcoin already:
* Adult toys &amp; Pr0n (most porn sites today) - Offers Privacy
* Video Game Prizefighting (leetcoin.com) - Offers game earning &amp; Gambling
* Microtipping (changetip) - Offers direct monetization/appreciation &amp; even product fulfillment now
* Lending (BTCJam) - Offers many new finance options for both borrowers and lenders
* Trading (BitFinex) - Access to new markets and faster money
...That's just off the top of my head.
The promise is already here, but in all of these cases, which I assume Pokerstars will be similar to, it's no overnight success. Potential customers take time to be educated about new products.

Although I'm a die-hard Bitcoin-purist, I'm all for you using the best cryptocurrency for your technical needs. The question in my mind is why is any currency better than another for your in-game currency? You don't really have the player accounts inside the game sending real coins between each other in real-time, do you? I'd have to assume there is some kind of behind-the-scenes IOU moving between accounts so your gameplay isn't slowed down by waiting for blockchain transactions and so forth...
If that's so, why is a dogecoin better than a bit? 
If in-game there is no difference, I'd HIGHLY suggest you use bits over any other cryptocurrency. There is extreme security in bitcoin's mining network that will make all other cryptocurrency obsolete one day. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:46:44
Realistic, but too pessimistic. It doesn't mention one new breakthrough app or use case and we had like 10 over 2014. 
One thing that is 100% certain to happen within a few months of now is that wallet security is about to be perfected. Tieing multisig wallets like GreenAddress to Oracles like Cryptocorp to hardware wallets like Case or even just Ledger is going to make personal bitcoin security so over-the-top that hackers really will give up. Imagine a big news story declaring "bitcoin is now unhackable." Wow, that will be pretty bullish if you ask me.

* Bitcoin is targeted by the govt for extermination

+1 on modeling much of it after Bountysource. Bounties and Kickstarter-like fundraising is how pretty much every centralized fund-needing service can be replaced, (including governments)( so we've just got to learn how to get good at decentralizing them.
One thing that hasn't been addressed here yet is the fact that no matter how awesome this turns out, statists will simply not understand that this does replace the bitcoin foundation. They will see this as not even remotely competing with the foundation, so don't expect the foundation to go anywhere when this is in full swing.

Everyone wants to seperate the two because they are worried that bitcoin isn't up to the job of fulfilling the promise of the blockchain, (or because banks don't want competition but see the blockchain as inevitable) but the fact is that you can't have a blockchain without the monetary incentive to keep mining it. Bitcoin is the only monetary incentive that can exist to do this job, so bitcoin and its' blockchain will never be separated.

A burned coin is one sent to a public address that no one has a private key for. It throws away that bitcoin forever.

It can't just all happen by one date; it's going to increment out slowly, with the latter half of the banks diversifying into bitcoin financial services... They may still call themselves banks though.
When the first country's currency collapses, those banks will be the first to go. The longer they last after that, the more likely they'll evolve into something that sticks around.
Example: If Argentina's Peso hyperinflates away next year, it'll take the  major banks based in Argentina with it because they won't be able to move their funds over to bitcoin like the people can.
Meanwhile other countries' banks will be watching and learning, and they'll get more diversified before it happens to them.

This has been well discussed for years now.
Yes, DRM would be "Better" using the blockchain, but it's not a total solution, at least not for media like pictures, videos and music.
What it comes down to is that a chipmaker, such as Intel, would need to provide the part of the process that checks the blockchain against your media and stops unauthorized content from being displayed.
Naturally if Intel went into business with the MPAA &amp; RIAA to implement this, there would be competing chipsets popping up that don't use this tech and would therefore steal a large chunk of profits from Intel. (Henceforth Intel won't agree to it.)
So I can't see this happening any day soon. (Whew.)
However, in Software you can put local enforcement in your own apps, so there's no reason we won't see DRM software that uses the blockchain. Expecting to see a nice solution for that anyday now.

Something being overlooked here is where is this money coming from?
Such a large influx of funds doesn't magically appear (Unless you're the federal reserve naturally) and therefore there will be a noticeable rise in the price of USD or whatever currency it is coming from. (inflation)
If the bitcoin price phenomenon happens globally, then perhaps all prices worldwide from all major currencies would take a small hit while bitcoin soars. In that rare instance the news would report on bitcoin but no nations's local currency needs to hyperinflate. I see this as being similar to balancing a piano on the head of a pin; extremely unlikely to happen this way.
If, however, the spread isn't so balanced, and a country like Argentina or Japan is the focal point of the exodus, then their currency is DOOMED to an overnight hyperinflation. It would be the bank run to end all bank runs, but at least the food supply wouldn't run out because people there would still have another currency to pay for it with. (For the first time in human history.)
The USD, being the most outstanding currency (largest M1) would need to lose a Trillion or more to bitcoin before hyperbitcoinization happens.... Japan and Argentina are much more susceptible and would fall relatively easy.
I think the most likely scenario is a smaller country like Ghana or the Philippines adopting bitcoin out of supreme utility first, and as the percentage of their country using bitcoin approaches 100%, their local currency would hyperinflate like Krawisz theorized... Effectively making that small geographical region a bitcoin-only zone.
Then another, then another, maybe a currency collapse or two like Japan going hyperinflated all on its' own... Then after a decade or so the rest of the world will start to see that commerce in the bitcoinized countries has picked up considerably while they are doing worse and the people will finally demand bitcoin replace their own fiat.

No, it wouldn't make much sense for Sidechains to be Proof of Work... Bitcoin will be heavy-lifting the security, so all these need to be is dainty little Proof of Stake or some other  scheme that is fairly secure, I believe. 
I'd assume it would go like this: A company like factom or group like Etherium creates their own chain, and stays responsible for it. After they're linked to the bitcoin blockchain, and value comes over to the sidechain, it's now up to that company to ensure that the reputation of the sidechain stays unblemished.
They'd better be ready to spend some coins on securing it well; and most importantly, the sidechain's purpose sure as hell better not be stepping on the toes of anything the government (or their prime lobbyists) give a crap about.

LOL; I forgot that you've been to the future. 
Here's the facts about a contentious hard fork, which has happened in other projects before, say, like unix &amp; ethereum.
1. The rest of the world that isn't paying attention will believe what the media tells them. If Paul Krugman goes on CNBC &amp; CNN telling the world that "Bitcoin is not scarce, Satoshi is a Liar!" - They'll beleive him and investor confidence will go to 0%. 
2. Don't overestimate the power of a good marketing campaign by the smaller chain. They will very likely call themselves the true bitcoin that works and is cheaper, labeling the existing bitcoin 'inferior &amp; broken.' When it's just two groups of nerds fighting over code, the world will see ALL of bitcoin as broken and asinine. Again, investor confidence to 0%. 
3. Mining power can be used in two ways; Defensively and Offensively. It can either mine your own chain, or it can mine empty blocks on top of the other guy's chain, attempting to kill it.  I'd bet anything that both sides will be trying to kill transactions from the enemy's chain... So the world will see BOTH chains doing a really sucky job at being a transactional system.
4. Most importantly, bitcoin isnt limited to 21m coins anymore. Something else called bitcoin will offer another 21m coins. Who knows how many splits there will be? Satoshi has obviously lied about Digital scarcity at this point. Investor confidence down to negative numbers, and not because of a misperception; bitcoin will deserve it.

This is mostly true, but not 100%. The person who takes fiat and gives you some kind of token representing that fiat on the network will always be the one assuming the risk, and the US Gov has many times in the past gone after these companies like egold, liberty reserve, and other companies that they claim were doing something similar to counterfeiting. This makes any solution risky.
However, if we can decentralize it enough, say, make everybody who wants to offer a personal IOU able to do so in an anonymous and secure way, then technically it could happen... Imagine Logging into OpenBazaar and buying some CryptoUSD IOUs denominated in Fiat from some merchant there who is anonymous but you know you can trust the currency because it is backed up by cryptocurrency, provably. Then you should be able to trade them like dollars and cash out like poker chips whenever you want... Still a bit awkward though.

It's too late at that point. 
The public will see that bitcoin has split into two bitcoins. 21m coins will be 42m coins. 
Cryptocurrencies will universally be thought of as *not* scarce after the fork.
Imagine what the media will say as soon as there are two coins, bitcoin A and bitcoin B… Economists like Paul Krugman will gleefully go on TV night after night and say “See, we told you bitcoins could be copied, there are now 42 Million bitcoins possible… I wonder how many there will be possible next year?”

Not at all. Here's how I see it... Bitcoin core has had just over 400 developers submit code to the project, and out of those, 100 have had their code published.
(You can see this on Github)
The meritocracy that they submit to ensures that only safe, extremely-well tested code comes out of the machine. That's both a blessing and a curse, because on one hand it won't f*ck up like BU did last week, but on the other hand it takes ages to get all the testing done and get the group's consensus.
BU hasn't only proven that they make crap code that will fail, they have proven by their very arrangement to expect a lot more code like that. 
Good devs will all stay away from BU, becuase they don't want to be associated with (or blamed for) failure.

Sorry for your experience. There certainly is a lot of differing opinion on this, and I think it's extra confusing because so many different types of wallets exist. Some do privacy best, some are pure security, some have great features like vendor maps, some are just banks like Coinbase, and others help out the bitcoin network by running a node. It's confusing.
Having kept btc and using them often since 2011, I'm personally comfortable with a system that starts out in a hardware wallet like Keepkey or Trezor. If your income/paycheck lands in that first, where it's the safest, from there you can send smaller amounts out to a mobile wallet like myceliem/breadwallet/airbitz when needed.
If you really don't want to use hardware for some reason, remember that saving bitcoins offline (cold storage) is the goal, no matter how you achieve it, that's where you main nest egg must reside. Paper will do, but as you've learned, to spend it, paper gets useless again real quick... Think of that as long-term-only.
Hardware wallets were invented exactly for this reason. They keep your privkey totally offline like a paper wallet but at the same time, you can spend it when needed like a desktop wallet.
Good luck!

Andreas' ThirdKeySolutions came to the rescue on Case... Making a totally questionable wallet hard as nails. Case is now among the very most secure of all wallets, and happens to be the most user-friendly of all.
Meanwhile, Gem does something magical that everyone is overlooking. I wrote about it here: 
It has basically targeted MtGox-like problems and eradicated them completely, but exchanges &amp; other financial service providers must choose Gem wallets to integrate with for us to see the benefits. -Expresscoin already has, hopefully we see others soon.

Think of bitcoin as money that exists in the cloud, that you can access anywhere just as easily as anywhere else... You can literally take a Billion dollars with you across any borders and no one will be able to detect that "movement," because you can even just carry the password in your head to use it and nothing else! (We call that a brainwallet.) 
But merchants to spend BTC at, of course, is different by region. Downtown BA seems to be a very strong hotspot for bitcoin: 
So you'll have no problems exchanging and buying anything you need with bitcoin there. There is a youtube documentary or three on using bitcoin in BA if I remember correctly, those should help with your research.
But something nobody seems to be mentioning yet is that being a bitcoin newbie, you really need to learn a lot about bitcoin Security. No one in their right mind is holding onto large sums of bitcoin in a 'hot' wallet anymore... (Wallets on your computer connected to the internet.) For your needs, you really need a very strong, preferably Multisignature wallet and learn everything about using it.
Look into either hardware wallets like the Trezor or BitStash, or even just web wallet services like BitGo.com &amp; GreenAddress.it. Make sure that if you use a multisig wallet of any kind that you will have website access to that service no matter where you go in Argentina.

I'd really like to see a decentralized, programatic credit agency. Every user of it agrees to have their pseudonym tracked by a trustless software that other users can report on when they do an action like buy or sell to you.
When dealing with the blockchain, it can all be trustless; the timestamps, the amounts, it's all perfect for doing credit ratings that show absolute facts about someone's payments/receipts in bitcoin.
The one drawback (for newbs) is that it would require each user to keep up with the private key for their account there. -Only the holder of the privkey would be able to edit their data on this network, and if it was ever lost, like a bitcoin, you'd have to throw away that whole account. (Or at least never edit it again.)

Can you imagine what the media will say at the point a second bitcoin is issued? Economists would go on TV and say "See, we told you bitcoins could be copied, there are now 42 Million bitcoins possible... I wonder how many there will be possible next year?"
All currency, from the first cowrie shell up to paper fiat, all of it, is worthless if people lose trust in it's value, a.k.a. faith that it won't be worth something similar tomorrow.
The trust in the currency of bitcoin would be wiped back to 2009 levels when there are 2 bitcoins... Prices will drop to under a dollar again, and it would never be able to climb back up to where it is now. Bitcoin would be a bona fide failure of a currency. Just from a single hard fork being contended.
All proof-of-work cryptocurrency would follow. The world will never again trust that this kind of data is scarce, and Satoshi will be branded a failure.
Any talk at all about doing a Hard fork is harmful to bitcoin.

The visionaries were all present when the price was under $100. (99% of them, anyway) Most of the price was the China syndrome, if you'll recall. That could be quite a bankrun.
But I'm worried about people everywhere, not just china. As soon as the new coin is issued, imagine what the media will say: Economists like Paul Krugman will gleefully go on TV night after night and say “See, we told you bitcoins could be copied, there are now 42 Million bitcoins possible… I wonder how many there will be possible next year?”
That's not a small dip; that's catastrophic. I still say we'll see $1 coins.
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:10:52
Think about it... Makes perfect sense: 
A. Big new merchant accepts bitcoin.
B. Bitcoiners send bitcoins directly to merchant, not thru an exchange.
C. Merchant sells coins on exchange(s).
D. Lots of new downward pressure on the price of a bitcoin at the exchanges.
This is exactly why VCs like Andressen said BTC was downtrending over the last few months; because Merchants are adopting faster than customers can keep up with.

Tens of MB blocks, you say?
Well before this point Devs say that the blocks are so big that it'll critically danger bitcoin's decentralization, since so few people would be able to afford hard drives to handle all those blocks. It's still measured in Gigabytes for now though.
Remember, only a few million people use bitcoin at all, and none of us use it every day for every purchase like people do with their credit cards.
100MB blocks = 300 TPS... Totally rediculous but that's what it'd take.
1GB blocks = 3000 TPS. Ok, you get the point. A gigabyte every minute would need modern nodes to add new terrabyte drives every single week.
But.... Just the Visa card network alone was doing 24,000 TPS back in 2010... I haven't seen any more modern numbers but I'm sure it's bigger, not smaller. And then there are all the other credit cards like MC, Discover, Amex, and then alllllll those debit cards and so on and so on.
On-chain scaling was never, ever going to take us to mainstream adoption. Satoshi didn't get a chance to work on scaling before he was frightened away so we can't know how he would have scaled it. We have to do the best for ourselves, and BU is headed in the opposite direction.

Although bitcoin's extremely unpredictable and could be $10,000 per coin next month after some ETF gets approved, I think your strategy is pretty sound. Definitely do a paper wallet and stick it into a fireproof safe or something if you're going to hold for a long time. 
I have used bitaddress offline as an HTML file on an unconnected laptop and have no regrets. It's a standard, but of course not secure enough for absolutely everyone's tastes. It's extremely difficult to approach perfect security though, I would settle for this if I were in your shoes.

**Why I am SCARED SHITLESS of the idea of a hardfork**
All money depends on the public trusting that it will retain it’s value in the future. That includes fiat money, which is just a step removed by trusting in the issuing government to keep your money valuable.
In fact, since Bitcoin is not declared to be money by any government, it is *more* dependent on Trust than any other currency on Earth today.
This scarcity, and by extension the public’s confidence in it, is the very most important attribute of a currency. 
If we hard fork Bitcoin in this contentious atmosphere, I believe we have a 100% chance of another coin appearing. 
Once it Bitcoin B is born, and both sides are calling their coin the "better" or even "Original" bitcoin, it will be impossible for most everyone out there in the real world to feel that bitcoin is still somehow still scarce. 
After all, 21 million possible coins would then be 42 million bitcoins in a matter of hours… What’s to stop that 42 from turning to 84 million coins next week? 
The public won’t know or care.
They'll just know that satoshi is a liar and that digital money doesn't work because it can't be scarce. (Those who even think that far)
Both bitcoins = Sub $1 forever. 
Game over.
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:35:31

This would not fall under any gambling laws/restrictions... It's hacking for profit as far as governments are concerned, so if you're in control of the wallet and don't press charges on a successful hack, then no problem.
Idea for you: Encourage others to donate to the fund by calling this (at least on the backside, to people inside the industry) "the burn address."  When people have to burn coins they would rather not waste them, so this is a great receptacle for burned coins as long as you swear never to give any back.

Global adoption could also come from a country like Argentina destroying their own currency overnight and everyone there jumping over to bitcoins because they don't have any other options.
There are several ways it could happen in spurts, and nobody knows yet which one will hit first.

Humanity is in the process of moving most things that we love online. Your friends are there, your interests are there, your money is there too, but it's not very safe or practical there like it is in your hands, is it? 
Bitcoin is a new form of Digital money that is very different from online banking, because it acts exactly like cash does but over the internet. There are no banks in bitcoin, there is only you and the person you are sending money to, and nothing can stop that transfer of value because the entire system is completely decentralized, similar to bitorrent.

Of course there's a reason to think bitcoin will be effected differently! 
It's MONEY... The others, especially Ethereum, are toys for nerds. There's all the difference in the world. Ethereum is a very useful tool for developers to use smart contracts with. I’ve got no beef against Ethereum, but it’s ‘fuel,’ ether, is simply not trying to be a currency. Has anyone started a campaign to get ether accepted at stores and gas stations?
Ethereum’s first fork resulting in ETC coins didn’t hurt ethereum’s geek-centric userbase too much, simply because ETH was never intended to be money. Eth is just a token fee to power the network, not a way to buy a latte. It’s certainly not stable enough store of value to stash your life savings in for long-term storage, and everyone seems to understand that already.
Bitcoin has a very different goal; it relies on the public’s trust to grow in usefulness, by adding peers for a network effect. Ethereum’s network is as big as it needs to be already to do their main purpose.

Your two cents are made of wood.
Do some math for yourself and stop listening to FUD... There is absolutely no way, none whatsoever, even in the slightest, that bitcoin can scale to global levels on chain.
Here, let me help. We've got a solid three transactions per second (TPS) on chain now before any backlog builds up in a 10-minute block, right?
Doubling the on-chain blocksize (withou segwit) would double the room for transactions, so 6 TPS. Still with me?
10 MB blocks would be 30 TPS, right?
At this point Devs say that the blocks are so big that it'll critically danger bitcoin's decentralization, since so few people would be able to afford hard drives to handle all those blocks. It's still measured in Gigabytes for now though.
Let's keep going... Remember, only a few million people use bitcoin at all, and none of us use it every day for every purchase like people do with their credit cards.

1GB blocks = 3000 TPS.  Ok, you get the point. A gigabyte every ten minutes would need modern nodes to add new terrabyte drives every single week.
But.... Just the Visa card network alone was doing 24,000 TPS back in 2010... I haven't seen any more modern numbers but I'm sure it's bigger, not smaller.  And then there are all the other credit cards like MC, Discover, Amex, and then alllllll those debit cards and so on and so on.
On-chain scaling was never, ever, EVER going to take us to mainstream adoption. Satoshi didn't get a chance to work on scaling before he was frightened away so we can't know how he would have scaled it. We have to do the best for ourselves, and BU is headed in the opposite direction.

It matters not. Companies, including all regulated bitcoin exchanges, have to fight for every last scrap of income. Do you think Coinbase would pull out of a whole country in order to defend bitcoin's right to include fungibility?  I bet the USSA is the first place they'd be forced to pull out of, in fact.
Since they won't go along with it, and the miners, who need them to turn their coins into fiat won't go along with it, I'm afraid the economic majority is with them.

Wrongo. 
Not splitting, adding segwit: 2-3MB blocks instantly, price shoots up beyond $2k, the network can handle the transactions until LN arrives and we're golden.
Splitting: Price under $1 within a day of the split on both coins.  
Bitcoin will have broken it's promise to the world that digits can be scarce! That's seriously devastating news to investors. 
The world will rightfully believe that they cannot be if a hard fork occurs and a new coin is issued. People everywhere can overlook problems like slow scaling but they will not overlook the scarcity problem. Cryptocurrencies will universally be thought of as not scarce.
Imagine what the media will say as soon as there are two coins, bitcoin A and bitcoin B… Economists like Paul Krugman will gleefully go on TV night after night and say “See, we told you bitcoins could be copied, there are now 42 Million bitcoins possible… I wonder how many there will be possible next year?”
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:27:09
Last time you cared, no one explained the facts to you. Allow me to correct that sad mistake.
Bitcoin has a solid three transactions per second (TPS) on chain now before any backlog builds up in a 10-minute block, right?
Doubling the on-chain blocksize (withou segwit) would double the room for transactions, so 6 TPS. Still with me?
10 MB blocks would be 30 TPS, right?
At this point Devs say that the blocks are so big that it'll critically danger bitcoin's decentralization, since so few people would be able to afford hard drives to handle all those blocks. It's still measured in Gigabytes for now though.
Let's keep going... Remember, only a few million people use bitcoin at all, and none of us use it every day for every purchase like people do with their credit cards.
100MB blocks = 300 TPS... Totally rediculous but that's what it'd take.
1GB blocks = 3000 TPS. Ok, you get the point. A gigabyte every minute would need modern nodes to add new terrabyte drives every single week.
But.... Just the Visa card network alone was doing 24,000 TPS back in 2010... I haven't seen any more modern numbers but I'm sure it's bigger, not smaller. And then there are all the other credit cards like MC, Discover, Amex, and then alllllll those debit cards and so on and so on.
On-chain scaling was never, ever, EVER going to take us to mainstream adoption. Satoshi didn't get a chance to work on scaling before he was frightened away so we can't know how he would have scaled it. We have to do the best for ourselves, and BU is headed in the opposite direction.
The storage size argument is settled. On-chain scaling is stupid, L2 is the only way bitcoin can go forward. (Of course we could go to 2MB blocks first for now, and that's what Segwit delivers... And then some.)

It is very much an oxymoron if you feel that bitcoin is meant for daily coffee money and every other purpose under the sun. On-chain scaling restricts all of the transactions to be recorded in blocks, currently set to 1 MB. Segwit will make those blocks average 2.1 MB. Let's do some napkin math, shall we?
If we are getting 3 Transactions Per Second at 1MB before a backlog builds, it stands to reason we should plan for 6 TPS at 2MB, and 24 TPS at 8MB. Right?
Some call 8 MB 'safe,' but would you run a bitcoin node (currently 80+ Gigabytes) if it were 8 times larger? That would be an expensive hard drive today... Node count would be drastically slashed from 8MB already.
It doesn't really matter though, because to scale on-chain up to global levels, we have to leave the realm of MBs completely and start storing Gigabyte or even Terrabytes every ten minutes. If we say that 1 million bitcoiners today each make a single purchase to come up with our 3 TPS, (of course it's much fewer people making daily purchases, but for the sake of simplicity) the world has another 7,200 times 1 million people that aren't using bitcoin yet. 
Imagine we multiply that 3 tps by 7,200, to represent the rest of the 7.2 Billion in the world catching on and using bitcoin once daily. That's 21,600 tps, with 7.2 GB blocks every ten minutes. Global bitcoin volume with everyone making 1 daily transaction should be in this neighborhood... But we want WAY more than one per person per day! 
You don't want to be limited to buying one item a day, do you? Morning coffee, 3 meals, a movie, some shopping, paying a bill or two, clearly we need bitcoin to be able to handle ten times that just for people to use... And then there's the business world. How many times a day does amazon, ebay, or google send a payment? Global commerce each year is already measured in the trillions of dollars, but once we give the other third of the world their first bank account, that will easily go into double current volumes with quadrillions in commerce.
Oh, don’t forget about the Internet of Things… They estimate we’ll all have 50 devices each talking to each other, and if they’re not using bitcoin directly to pay each other for services, then they’ll at least need the bitcoin blockchain to use to prove identity.
Businesses have other uses, like timestamping and storing all their precious data assets on the blockchain too... So how many important business documents do you think will be stored there? Other blockchains aren't proven secure, so a lot of the business world will insist on using bitcoin's blockchain for their most important data, no matter the fee. 
There's a lot of guesswork involved, but my conservative estimates I'd put block sizes over a Terrabyte when bitcoin goes global. That's an Exabyte every week. Running a node wouldn't even be practical for Amazon at that size.
No nodes = Bitcoin dead.

You simply have no idea of what money is. You're describing an asset. Money is a commodity that is trusted to always be there as the final way to settle a debt. The general medium of exchange, the thing that all other goods and services are traded for, the final payment for such goods and services on the market.
Bitcoin's obviously not there yet, but we all seem to agree that that's the goal we're shooting for. It's going to take decades to get everyone using it, 7.3 Billion people, but it seems inevitable from this point... The Network Effect is headed that way.
Ethereum's network effect is taking it torwards a widespread use for businesses to use it as a new type of database. Sure, Ether's price is going to go up as long as that keeps spreading, but it's not even kinda sorta competing with bitcoin. It's just an asset that companies will need to use that new database.

You are discussing options that coders take to fix broken code. Sure, bitcoin the code will survive.
Now... What about the public's trust in the currency?
All money depends on the public trusting that it will retain it’s value in the future. That includes fiat money, which is just a step removed by trusting in the issuing government to keep your money valuable.
In fact, since Bitcoin is not declared to be money by any government, it is more dependent on Trust than any other currency on Earth today.
This scarcity, and by extension the public’s confidence in it, is the very most important attribute of a currency. If we hard fork Bitcoin and another coin appears, it’ll be impossible for most everyone to feel that bitcoin is still somehow still scarce. After all, 21 million possible coins could be 42 million in a matter of hours… What’s to stop that 42 from turning to 84 million coins next week? The public won’t know or care.
Such a split will absolutely OBLITERATE the public's trust in currency and the press will repeat the following words daily until bitcoin is forgotten about:  "Satoshi lied, data cannot be scarce."

Ethereum is very different, because Ether was not designed to be money, and never needed the trust that all currencies need. It’s immune to a loss-of-confidence attack, and bitcoin is most definitely not.
Ethereum is a very useful tool for developers to use smart contracts with. I’ve got no beef against Ethereum, but it’s ‘fuel,’ ether, is simply not trying to be a currency. Has anyone started a campaign to get ether accepted at stores and gas stations?
Ethereum’s first fork resulting in ETC coins didn’t hurt ethereum’s geek-centric userbase too much, simply because ETH was never intended to be money. Eth is just a token fee to power the network, not a way to buy a latte. It’s certainly not stable enough store of value to stash your life savings in for long-term storage, and everyone seems to understand that already.
Bitcoin has a very different goal; it relies on the public’s trust to grow in usefulness, by adding peers for a network effect. Ethereum’s network is as big as it needs to be already to do their main purpose.

Satoshi was talking about a time before the contention. 
Back then, a HF was no big deal because everyone agreed that the devs knew what was best for us and nobody mined against bitcoin core.
Today that's a laughable hope. Satoshi wasn't a god; he couldn't see how the community would react to his code.
Today if a HF happens, and the mining hash rate is split at any considerable level, (maybe even as low as 5%) we've opened the door for megabanks and governments to blame the 20-45% hashpower that they manage to produce on the BU camp. They can make it seem like BU is equally as powerful to bitcoin core, or somewhere close, and then boom, a new coin will suddenly be issued from an exchange that they own or control somehow.

Anyway, we only have 5000 nodes now... For true decentralization and government censorship protection, that needs to go up, not down.
On-chain will always be the soul source of value for all of the network, but the whole network doesn't need to happen inside the blocks. Layer two solutions like lightning network and sidechains are just the start... I'd love to see five layers on top of bitcoin, even customized, per-use layers spawned and closed immediately one day.

Your definition of "exactly what Case will do" is sadly lacking, however.
First of all, you're phone's wallet can be targeted and emptied by malware. Case cannot... That alone makes me never want a wallet on a phone.
Secondly, what phone wallet has as much security as Case does? It's got a Fingerprint reader for one key, a second key held at the service provider which needs a Pin code from you to release, and a 3rd key split into ten different HSMs in 10 different freaking COUNTRIES so that it would take 11 different, specific  Governments determined to get your wallet to work together in order to open it.
That's pretty freaking secure. How is that "exactly" like your phone app again?

Think really hard about why gold has value, or any other tradeable commodity... Bitcoin has it too.
Ultimately, it all comes down to what people are willing to pay. Dollars, Gold, stocks, bitcoin, your house, everything worth money is ultimately only worth as much money as someone else will pay for it.
That doesn't matter if it's virtual or physical or even metaphorical... If it's scarce then people will pay more for them.

Well, the only way I've ever heard that 110% safeguard bitcoins is too technical to do for most people, basically using dice to make your own paper wallet. (Google diceware for instructions) Short of that, hardware wallets like Trezor, Keepkey, and the Ledger Nano S are vastly superior to most other wallets out there because they generate your private key offline and keep it offline forever... No hacker can get to it on the device itself, and the device never sends it to your computer. That's really great security, but there is the tiniest, slightest chance that some of the chips on their open-source hardware board could be made by bad actors, such as if Intel corp was out to steal some coins.
The chances of that are slim to none, so you're about as safe as it gets. Now it's up to you to safeguard your seed phrase - Storing that in a fireproof safe that no one else can open should do the trick.

There is a difference between facts and what the vast majority of the world believes.
I'm absolutely convinced that they will believe after the fork that there are two bitcoins, and to them they WILL NOT GIVE A CRAP if those coins are spendable on the other chain or not...

Whatever tolerance they had for bitcoin before then, that's more than enough for them to lose it.

_THE_ problem with making this happen is simply one of coordination. 
Such booths would be absolutely useless to customers if they didn't have a wide variety of booths in other places to send money to. (In this network) So whichever booths start first are doomed to months, if not years, of no customers while the network builds.
However, if one of you geniuses started a coordination effort, planning on some kind of website or even just a shared google map to get a concentration of booths working on the same launch day, then you could offer something that customers could actually use.
I'd suggest waiting to launch until you have at least 1 merchant ready and waiting in every big city over 1/2 million people in size. (In the legal countries, of course.)

The only way one could actually restrict payment to the original content creator would be for content creators to start putting a public key into their content somehow, perhaps repeating throughout the entire content's length that the torrenting client software can read.
Without that (kinda drastic) step from content creators, there is simply nothing to tie ownership of it to a payment address.
Despite the required changes, I await with baited breathe the day a movie producer or music star decides to release his/her content on such a network. Labels and studios would suddenly have to give up a very large percentage of their cut, keeping the money in the artists' hands.

Over a 2/3rds of the world doesn't have access to bank accounts. That includes 90 % of the continent of africa and 10% of the continent of North America.  Bitcoin wallets each function as a bank account, and people can trade directly from wallet to wallet for goods and services. That economically empowers anyone with a smartphone to open their own business for the first time... They just don't do so with the local currency.


Yes, but it's very young and needs to scale first. The volatility of bitcoin makes it act like a stock instead of a currency, which means few trust it to hold their wealth yet... But go check btcvol.info - Bitcoin's most of the way to where it needs to be already to show the world it's trustworthy.


You're obviously not earning it for your goods and services yet. Many of us are, and are totally living on it without touching fiat currencies as much as we can.

One (albeit a good one) merchant's loss isn't even a blip on the radar to some of the real signals you should be looking at...

2. GMO, a company that is like google + Amazon + the largest ISP all rolled into one in Japan, has announced they'll be opening an exchange and coinbase-like bitcoin bank service this year. Japan's traffic could easily quadruple or more from that alone.
3. Other big companies that have just been waiting for bitcoin to scale are sitting on the sidelines now, watching for something like segwit to allow them into the game.
4. One or more of the Endemic apps like openbazaar, yours, Abra, code valley, satoshipay, and others that require bitcoin could take off soon, launching a whole new economy that really has no upper limit on users other than the earth's population. 
All of these things could EACH do more for bitcoin than ALL of the merchants to date have. Now is a silly time to worry about losing growth.

This is where I'd have to disagree. It's not that I think there is no bias at all, but Chinese miners and Ver and many others appear to be attacking this exact point about them, based on evidence that Core "doesn't want or refuses to make blocks bigger."
However, the record clearly shows the opposite. Segwit _IS_ an actual block size raise that has made 3.6 MB blocks, far larger than they agreed to in Hong Kong. Why do people think there is a motive to take bitcoin in other directions? They over-delivered in the one direction agreed to. (ok, a bit late, but they did.)
Is it just the blockstream core conspiracy about not wanting to scale on chain? Even it it were true that's hilariously bad logic. 
The idea of scaling on-chain is ludicrous, and they've been telling us for years but people like Ver &amp; miners won't listen. I believe it was in 2012 when they first did the math and have shown us all that we'd need to add new 10-Terrabyte drives to full nodes WEEKLY to keep up with global adoption transactions... This isn't an option to even keep bitcoin alive, much less decentralized.
Think about it; 3 TPM (currently) has made a 101 GB blockchain.  That means for 1GB blocks, we'd still only have 3,000 TPS. A gigabyte every 10 minutes is already far past sustainable. However, just the Visa card network alone was doing 24,000 TPS back in 2010.
Off chain scaling is the way to make bitcoin grow, period. On-chain scaling already happened, it's called Segwit. Now it has to be adopted to clear up the short-term problems before we can address the real ones.
Knowing all of that, I'd say the Devs have done a slow but extremely good job of taking bitcoin towards the only direction that can scale it.

A hard fork in this contentious atmosphere could literally kill bitcoin. Literally, to the ground, both forks... It's a real danger and at best we can expect the value of bitcoins to go sub $10. Somehow, one side (I won't name names, lol) wants to do whatever it takes to raise the block size immediately without activating segwit... Including risking bitcoin's complete obliteration.
Yet that same side doesn't even acknowledge the fact that segwit is a block size adjustment at all... You just can't get any of them to admit it raised block sizes.

I'm stunned at how many of you are skipping over the usefulness of a Blockchain ID. (The general proof of username, not specifically the citizenship.) It's a way to have your pseudonym take responsibility.
Think about these cards as a mathematically provable OpenID profile... It need not mention you at all though!
Imagine you want to run a business online anonymously, for instance, and you need to have a public face there, &amp; to prove that you were indeed the person controlling that psuedonym, without linking it back whatsoever to your real name. Possession of one of these handy cards would be perfect.
I have no interest in being a citizen of any nation at all, online nor off, but having a way to prove I control my Nyms is extremely useful... And isn't open to hacking like an openID profile is.

1. Their firmware/software is all open source, so no.
2. They'll likely send a new one, but it's not going to happen often.
3. The best defense against loss or fire of seed is to keep another copy of it far away. Some keep it in multisignature format so they print out five seeds and hide them at five different locations and it takes more than one to access the funds. Most people just store it in a fireproof safe, however.
4. True hack-proofedness is a myth, but hardware wallets are, without a doubt, the best compromise offering far more security than anyone else around uses today but still can't be perfect against highly targeted, well-funded attacks.
5. Trezor, Keepkey, and Nano S are great, with minor differences between them. I've used all three and prefer keepkey, but not because it's more secure... It's the most luxurious and the most durable against threats I perceive to be likely. Others disagree.  They all have slightly different features, too.

Hard forks _change_ bitcoin's existing code, and they are risky, because most miners have to agree to switch to the new fork of the code together. - Many of us doubt that can ever happen again.
Soft forks _add to_ bitcoin's code, which doesn't carry any risk for most people, but those who decide to not upgrade bitcoin's code to the new version won't get the new functionality that the new code offers.
In Segwit's case, the soft fork to the new code gives miners the ability to make blocks up to 4 Megabytes in size, so it _should_ be highly loved by the big blocker crowd... Unfortunately, they all believe in conspiracy theories about some company trying to take control of bitcoin so they're demanding a hard fork instead, and have been fighting Segwit's SF.

Of course TPS is a problem to be fixed. But if you've been here for more than a year or two, you've seen a dozen such problems to be fixed, get fixed.
With $400 Million+ in VC money this year, tens of thousands of github projects dedicated to it, and more coders working on it than anything else in history, Bitcoin kinda has a way of solving all problems in its' path. It's antifragile that way.
I don't know how many actual on-chain transactions they'll finally get out of the blockchain itself, but with offchain transactions and now Sidechains, I don't see any problems left in TPS anymore. Just coding and time.

HFs are dangerous when the mining hashrate is split, which happens when people disagree and WANT to split off to a new coin. The decision is made pretty fatal when an exchange issues a new coin for the new chain.
Bitcoins 1 &amp; 2 will both go under $1 and stay there forever if that happens... But here's the kicker - There's more teams at play than Core &amp; BU... There's also HSBC and Uncle Sam and the Fed and the EU and the PRC... And 500+ other teams.
If just ONE of them decides it's in their best interest, this block size debate gives them the absolute Perfect cover to attack during a hard fork and blame it on the one of the two developer communities.

The law was originally put there for the start of our infamously bad "war on drugs" so they could (theoretically) stop the payment for drugs... Which of course depended on them showing the court that there was a connection to drugs.
In the decades since, these laws have been perverted to literally mean "If a cop stops you and finds money, he gets it, period. You must expect to never see it again. Give it to him or he can shoot you like a dog and get away with it."
Cops claim that it simply pays for their department's fees, but they have been caught simply pocketing it uncountable times.

We're dead set against Contentious hard forks. No one was against the one in 2012 where there were suddenly billions of bitcoins... Everyone was happy that bitcoin would be fixed and their money would be valuable again.
What we have today would 10000% guarantee a new coin would be issued on the new chain and they'd be calling theirs "the real" bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:30:15
1. It's not majority of miners. BU is signalling what today?
2. Mining keeps a chain safe, but what makes it valuable? Do you think all the vendors of the world (millions of stores and businesses) will follow BU? If not, there's nowhere to spend a BU coin and it won't be worth anything.
All likelihood is that both coins will be sub $1 forever after a coin split. We'll have broken the sacred contract with the world that digits can be scarce. They'll call us and most of all Satoshi  liars for breaking that promise... Afterall, after a split there will be 42 million coins called bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:53:17
The problem with this is that the BU team is advocating for two very dangerous things that should NEVER be risked.... Their emergent consensus is dangerous in a way that gives miners all the power and could literally destroy everything with their greed once activated. They won't even allow it to be peer reviewed, so they must sense it's danger.
Even worse, most on that side are calling for a "Simple Hard Fork" to raise the block size instead of Core's "Complicated Soft Fork."
What they seem to have developed amnesia about in the last year or two is that hard forks are WAY too risky when there is any contention in the air, and well over 10% of us have been polled to show we will never accept a hard fork under any circumstances... Because it will directly lead, within hours, to the total loss of confidence in bitcoin's currency when the coin splits into two. 
Both of these nightmares keep real developers up at night, and those not bright enough to realize the horrors that they present are all advocating to BU as a fast fix to bitcoin's scaling solution.
How do you compromise with this? Hard forks and emergent consensus will NEVER be acceptable to the Core crowd. Think the BU team would settle for something else?

The only banks who would be interested in using bitcoin are those who just don't understand it yet. They think they can buy or use the rails of this distributed service and if they actually put pen to paper one day, they'll discover that it's a losing proposition for them, no matter how they try to use bitcoin.
Some people suggest they just use bitcoin for clearing payments between each other in house, but those amounts are routinely many times larger than the entirety of bitcoin's market cap... Chase sometimes moves $1 Trillion daily. Bitcoin would have to grow quite a lot to accommodate them, and of course that's something they're not going to spend time and reputation to help us with.
If any bank does put their name behind bitcoin, giving it the finance-industry endorsement that the mainstream has been looking for,  then that one bank may outlast the others... But it's quite clear that will start a chain reaction that will be replacing the banking industry at large. It's way too big of a change for them to try.

I'm all for a SOFT fork to anything the devs say is safe for relieving today's (and tomorrows) congestion problems. Unfortunately, Hard forks can no longer be employed on Bitcoin... They are not safe at all, and will easily result in two competing Bitcoins in a contentious environment like this one, and I can't see how that contention would ever go away now. 
Raising the block size should have been done years ago but now we're stuck with 1MB MAX_BLOCK_SIZE and need to deal with it. Soft forks are the only on-chain scaling solutions we have left... At least they can result in larger blocks a la segwit.

You're still not addressing the cost savings at all though; To make a centralized system for a business like ticketmaster, they usually buy a huge server rack in a climate-controlled room and pay for tons of bandwidth.  
Putting tickets on the blockchain isn't the nicest thing to do to the bitcoin miners, but as far as ticketmaster is concerned, it sounds like they no longer have to pay for that rack of servers nor bandwidth anymore! 
Sure, they'll need to run some open source software on a desktop client in order to put the tickets on the blockchain, but for checking on and using the tickets, all transactions are done between ticket holders and the blockchain, not even bothering ticketmaster ever again.

I've read the whole page twice now and cannot see one instance where they sign for you. I don't think you are getting the essence of my claim here.
Imagine a hacker has full run of your PC. If there is a 3rd party, remote signer (in the obvious meaning, not in CoinKite's twisted definition) then the hacker has to go hack the 3rd party too before he can get at your money.
The way it appears CoinKite and their HSM is set up to do "remote signing" is to let YOU use software on your computer to sign with that key yourself. It's more complicated than just having fewer keys, but it's still all accessible to the hacker who can do whatever you can do on your computer. He won't have to break into CoinKite's servers to sign with your remote key.

Bitcoin is an open source software, and different teams have different visions for it's progression. The team that has always maintained bitcoin today wrote Segwit and it is already being adopted by the majority of everyone except the conspiracy theorists and some miners who hold more than enough hashing power to stall the rest of us.
Here's the benefits of segwit: 
Basically, this is going to take some time to make bitcoin scale because of the separatists. It may even take a compromise, but at least the other team doesn't seem willing to fork off and make their own bitcoin like Ethereum did. If they tried, they certainly wouldn't have a lot of mining power and we could probably destroy their tiny coin quickly... Those separatist miners have everything to lose if so.

There is exactly one winning strategy in this fight:
Keep your head down &amp; produce more decentralized solutions that lie outside of their control.
Programs like Bittorrent, Bitcoin, OpenBazaar &amp; Lighthouse, are going to be what stops them; not anything you can do through political nor even activist channels.
Give people software/tech they need that can't be controlled, and in this post-snowden world, they will choose it over the centralized alternatives.
Eventually, every last thing that governments do at all will have a decentralized app to replace it, from law to charity to defense to police... And governments themselves won't have anything at all useful to offer a single citizen anymore.

Nations have borders, but cryptocurrencies cannot; Like Auroracoin's hilarious launch showed us; miners from outside the 'approved list' will mine a national/regional currency and can indeed control the majority of the mining.
But even putting mining aside; what makes a currency truly useful is its' Liquidity. If OP's vision were to get underway, and Crypto-USD were to be a nationally-approved currency to compete with Crypto-Franc and Crypto-Peso in the new forex exchanges; then what would stop people, all people, anywhere in the world, from simply using the one cryptocoin with the most liquidity?
Let's say bitcoin &amp; crypto-usd were both available to you, and bitcoin has the most liquidity of the three because it encourages people from every country on earth to adopt it.
In that case, knowing that you can use bitcoins in more places, and they're more likely to stick around, and less likely to be inflated or QE'd, wouldn't you simply keep using it instead of spending them on crypto-USDs then being limited with what you can use those for?
Of course bitcoin isn't the most liquid currency yet, but if the dollar were to be replaced with a crypto-usd, then surely bitcoin would have a jump on it then.

If storjcoins get traded for anything else, and their price isn't locked in a permanent exchange rate for bitcoins, then they are being traded as something other than a bitcoin coupon.
Coupons redeemable only for bitcoins are coupons, and that is acceptable... But the moment someone sells those coupons on an exchange or other public place for a price other than the locked-in trade rate, then they are their own currency competing at market rates.
If their price floats freely on the market, then they are, by definition, not available at a locked price to bitcoin anymore, and therefore are a separate currency.
I think a Sidechain can fix this problem, locking the rate in by setting bitcoin aside in exchange for them... But after perusing the whitepaper it appears that the authors will never go for that because Storj can't generate all the bitcoins needed to do this.
It's a shame they are so economically illiterate; we desperately need Storj but this could kill it, and hurt bitcoin at the same time.

No really, when people get an amount of bitcoin that is smaller than the mining fee for sending it, a fair percentage of them get a negative impression about bitcoin overall.

1MB blocks today = 101 GB blockchain
32MB after the same # of transactions = around 3 Terrabytes.
How many nodes do you think we'll have then?
Anyway, remember, only a few million people use bitcoin at all, and none of us use it every day for every purchase like people do with their credit cards.
100MB blocks = 300 TPS... Totally rediculous but that's what it'd take.
1GB blocks = 3000 TPS. Ok, you get the point. A gigabyte every minute would need modern nodes to add new terrabyte drives every single week.
But.... Just the Visa card network alone was doing 24,000 TPS back in 2010... I haven't seen any more modern numbers but I'm sure it's bigger, not smaller. And then there are all the other credit cards like MC, Discover, Amex, and then alllllll those debit cards and so on and so on.
On-chain scaling was never, ever going to take us to mainstream adoption. Satoshi didn't get a chance to work on scaling before he was frightened away so we can't know how he would have scaled it. We have to do the best for ourselves, and BU is headed in the opposite direction.

It's not that they say "Bah, fools gold!" -They've decided the right amount to purchase for minimizing risk while maximizing rewards. I bet every billionaire that has taken the time to understand bitcoin -in the slightest- has purchased ~1 bitcoin.
That way if bitcoin dies they don't feel they've risked anything, but if it survives they'll own a portion of the planet's entire wealth that far surpasses the amount of wealth they have now purportionally.
They're simply playing the odds correctly.

Scaling is perfectly possible. Off-chain doesn't mean whatever it is you think it means.
Remember how in the past everyone used gold as a store of value and money both at once? People trusted, for something like 6000 years, that gold was valuable and that trust is the key thing. When societies moved to paper money, they didn't trust in paper itself, they trusted in the gold that their govt was holding that said 'backs' the paper. -At least until 1971. 
With Bitcoin it's no different, just a very different delivery system. 
We can make tokens on the lightning network and on sidechains and many other networks that can be issued representing actual bitcoin, therefore transferring it's value like a paper dollar bill transfer's gold's value. 
They are cryptologically proven to be secure and non-counterfeitable. (Let's see the dollar do that!) They can ferry the value of bitcoin around these new networks with far higher TPS. -The only problem then becomes, will they be centralized now - And several solutions like Rootstock and Lightning network are not very centralized at all.

Ethereum is a very useful tool for developers to use smart contracts with. I’ve got no beef against Ethereum, but it’s ‘fuel,’ ether, is simply not trying to be a currency. Has anyone started a campaign to get ether accepted at stores and gas stations?
Ethereum’s first fork resulting in ETC coins didn’t hurt ethereum’s geek-centric userbase too much, simply because ETH was never intended to be money. Eth is just a token fee to power the network, not a way to buy a latte. It’s certainly not stable enough store of value to stash your life savings in for long-term storage, and everyone seems to understand that already.
Bitcoin has a very different goal; it relies on the public’s trust to grow in usefulness, by adding peers for a network effect. Ethereum’s network is as big as it needs to be already to do their main purpose.
From cowrie shells to gold coins, historical money was never accepted by anyone who didn’t believe that they’d be able to receive the same or better amount of goods or services with that money when they go to sell it.
All money depends on the public trusting that it will retain it’s value in the future. That includes fiat money, which is just a step removed by trusting in the issuing government to keep your money valuable.
In fact, since Bitcoin is not declared to be money by any government, it is more dependent on Trust than any other currency on Earth today.
This scarcity, and by extension the public’s confidence in it, is the very most important attribute of a currency. If we hard fork Bitcoin and another coin appears, it’ll be impossible for most everyone to feel that bitcoin is still somehow still scarce. After all, 21 million possible coins could be 42 million in a matter of hours… What’s to stop that 42 from turning to 84 million coins next week? The public won’t know or care.
Trust in a currency is the primary fight that every currency must constantly battle, especially with Bitcoin. People already have a hard time trusting bitcoins to retain value because they believe data to be intrinsically copy-able. Every person we bring to understand that bitcoin is scarce is a huge win… But an attack on bitcoin's Trust can undo all of these victories.

I can't agree with that. Blockchains, permissionless or otherwise, are a new, impressive ingredient that can be used with lots of different recipes. 
At this moment, the public has no clue what they are nor how they create honesty. One day, however, the way all these banks are ejaculating on the trouser leg of "blockchain" the public will have heard it enough to let the definition (and possibilities) sink in.
It's basically branding. People just need to hear it through repetition to the point where they understand something that they otherwise wouldn't have had the interest to learn.
In time they'll know that using money without a blockchain is basically a nigerian prince scam, and the most secure blockchain on that day will still be bitcoin.

It basically helps prove the underlying tech of bitcoin is sound. 
Assuming they totally dominated that market? (Which may be likely with the DTCC in on it.) It still can only bring industrial acceptance to blockchains, helping prove that they are necessary for global finance, which all the rest of the markets will eventually follow.
In a world where the entire global finance infrastructure is blockchain-dependent and all the key players understand why, it seems pretty obvious that Bitcoin, being the most valuable blockchain currency and trusted store of value using a blockchain will be desirable by everyone within it.

Actually, the odds of bitcoin replacing fiat completely (If it survives at all) is 100%. To understand why, you just need to look at the history of governments. States will always fight to retain the ability to print money, and as long as they do so, they inflate the money supply.
Hyperinflation has occurred in 73% of the currencies that have ever existed. The rest of them are either still with us (and not that old) or were discontinued due to some kind of government replacement. (War or Coup.)
There is no example of what I'm about to say happening in the past because every currency in the past was controllable. Some people got out but most of the citizenry each time had no other currency to buy in order to save their wealth during hyperinflation... So if you think it through, you will eventually see that 100% destruction of national currencies is unavoidable. 
A. National currency (Let's say $ for example) starts to inflate too fast for comfort, in order to be able to pay the interest on the existing, snowballing debt. The usual Govt tricks that keep prices down start to come apart under the extreme load and the public finally starts feeling the pain. (I won't guess which year that happens in the USA, but likely within a decade.)
B. As the $ inflates, more and more people turn to bitcoin for savings, which has a limited supply. This happened in Cyprus already, and bitcoin wasn't 1/5th as trustworthy then.
C. As more people buy bitcoins, limited supply with this new demand causes the BTC price to go up. (deflates) Deflation of BTC causes two different, desirable effects:
 C1: Investor of BTC becomes happy; either hodls more or advocates louder, or both. 
 C2: Other citizens see their neighbor has done well for him/herself buying bitcoin and considers the same.
D. As $ is traded (for bitcoin) away from the citizenry back towards the banks, more inflation occurs as the dollar has fewer
    buyers! Bonds will be downgraded, credit ratings lowered, stocks moving to other exchanges, etc...
E. $ is also used to pay off large debts like mortgages. If your income is suddenly a half million $ per month, paying off your mortgage is easy as pie. Banks get stuck with all that $, too.
***Repeat steps B-E repeatedly. No fiat currency can withstand this attack! This is Hyperbitcoinization in a nutshell.***
F. Hyperinflation of $ arrives in full. Soon the govt cannot pay in $ to get anyone to do anything. The troops, police, and the IRS's salary cannot be paid in $; those people will want money that has value instead. Everyone will demand other currencies, and soon thereafter the IRS can no longer do business in $. It just isn't practical in the slightest if no one touches the stuff and it has no value. Note: Refusal of $ happens before Taxes collected.
F. For the govt to survive, they'll have to accept bitcoin. That will be a very, very easy decision for them to make at the time, considering that total loss of power is the alternative for each of them.

Bitcoin's never had a contentious hard fork. It's a world of difference.
Bitcoin's hard forks in the past were _problems_ that literally everyone agreed need to be fixed, fast. 
In this contentious environment, a hard fork would be a _great opportunity_ for an enemy of bitcoin to destroy it through taking action... Which starts by getting an exchange to issue a coin on the new chain.
If someone had known enough how to profit off of getting MtGox to issue a new coin for Bitcoin B in the minutes after the billions of bitcoins were created in 2012, then there would not be a bitcoin today. Luckily bitcoin's enemies were not big enough yet, or at least they weren't smart enough yet to figure out how to do that.
I'm not even talking about Roger's camp... Think of the two halves of the debate as the 'cover' for bigger enemies like megabanks and governments who would feel threatened by bitcoin because their ponzi schemes rely on having control over money printing.
A hard fork unequivably gives any bad actor, no matter the reason, a way to destroy bitcoin and blame it on our debate.

Dude, paternalism is exactly the drive behind a large percentage, if not the vast majority, of the worlds donations today.
It's even more simple than that. People with funds that want to donate have a mental image of something they want, say, seeing a hungry guy get a hot meal, in exactly the same way you see that gizmo in the store window and imagine it enriching your life just before you buy it.
Yes, telling a homeless guy "you can't use this money on booze" is not in the homeless guys' best interest, but it's a binary decision to take it. Bitcoin gives Donors the tech to do what they've been wanting to do from the start. -Homeless ppl can always say no.

My argument is that bitcoin's fees while we're at 1MB are Ginormous, and they have that now. Why make changes to hope that th price goes up when they're earning record amounts as things are?
Jihan and his crew would keep us at 1MB forever if the price stayed up. They're using BU and Roger like pawns.


Yes, but a record-sized bird in the hand is often better than two in the bush, at some unknown date in the future.


LOL, the height of naivety. Miners obviously know they'll never mine BU because most of those signaling BU today are mining core. And it's pretty obvious that the rest of the community and world wants nothing to do with BTU coins.  


Then go to Github and Core's site and check out the numbers to try to insert some rational consideration. 
425+ core code submitters.
110+ recent committers
17 core maintainers listed on the site
6 Blockstream employees (not all core maintainers)
and ONE blockstream employee has one of the all-important Commit keys, (Sipa) but he has sworn to never use it for Scaling proposals.
Interestingly, Greg Maxwell used to have a second commit key... A year ago he turned it in to avoid the accusations that you're making right now.
If Blockstream is trying to influence scaling to make their products profitable, they're clearly morons at it.


This is the *height* of arrogance. Core devs are literally among the very most skilled and talented Dev groups in Earth's history, and they've got Cypherpunks like Adam Back and Nick Szabo helping out and acting as a moral compass to keep bitcoin about Freedom and decentralization. They haven't shipped broken code in four whole years now, despite dozens of upgrades during that time. 
Seriously, have you taken part in their meritocracy and seen for yourself how seriously they take testing? That's want you want out of a dev team, not hasty decisions that lead to downtime in a $20b financial network. Roger will certainly be held accountable for spreading this particular lie.
BTW, if it was the Businesses' interests that that aren't being taken seriously, why is it that only Miners side with BU while businesess nearly unanimously say things like this: 
Have you seen the segwit adoption page? All the important infrastructure business in the space is already segwit ready or has started their upgrade... Even Blockchain, which Roger is a primary investor in.

You're half right. Since Mike didn't feel that bitcoin could survive Blockstream's control, he felt defeated and disenfranchised, and that made it very easy for R3 to tempt him over to the dark side. 
Maybe he still thinks he'll be building a better bitcoin at R3... He said something to that effect... But the point is that R3 saw a weak developer and took advantage of him. -It doesn't have to be a conspiracy, just a smart business move by Rutter and Cooper.

Transaction medium is one use for bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-07 01:32:03
Many ways. 
1. Hard Forks in a controversial environment like this one will very easily result in two competing bitcoins that the public will see as a stock split, and they'll lose confidence in bitcoins, cryptocurrency, and the whole concept of digital scarcity. All the work we've done over the last 8 years, lost. Sub $1 bitcoins forever.
2. Emergent consensus is risky as hell, and has not been peer reviewed. 
3. The five or so BU devs are basically the rejects of the 100+ person core development team. One has the manpower to carefully test and weed out mistakes, the other doesn't. Guess which is which. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:12:06

Yes &amp; no. The fact that the network is with you gives you the economies of scale that make it the most desirable anyway.


LOL... There are tons of better altcoins out there than bitcoin. Bitcoin's slow and has dozens of legit complaints like long block times and horrible scaling that altcoins fixed in themselves long, long ago. Zcash is fully anonymous. Some have decentralized exchange built right into their wallets.... Bitcoin is a dinosaur... But It's got the network effect and it's headed moonwards.
For another coin to come along and be useful enough to stop that, it would have to be so much more revolutionary than bitcoin, than bitcoin is to the dollar... Fixing fungibility and scaling just isn't enough.

Ethereum isn't money, wasn't trying to be money, doesn't even smell like money.
Bitcoin has taken 8 years so far to build up trust with all the merchants and businesses and Venture capitalists and so forth... All that network effect... All to convince the world that digits can be scarce and these digits represent value like a gold bar.
When the blockchain splits, no one will ever feel digital scarcity for money exists again... At least not in proof of work, I guess.

Since devs have said that -average- block sizes on testnet when testing Segwit are around 2.1 MB, a 110% block size raise, then it should take fees down to where they were when blocks were only 45% full on average, about May 2015. 
I think most of the fee cost growth happened above 80%, (late 2016) so dropping to may 2015 fees would be a huge, immediate drop. We'd celebrate, everyone would use bitcoin more, and unfortunately, we'd still be back up to 100% again by 2018 I'd think.
Lightning can't come fast enough, but I really would love to see fees that low again.

It really doesn't have the affect of a soft fork though, because the date of "with us or against us" is on a particular date... Which will give the BU side tons of time to plan their hard fork on that date, which is what they'd do if they felt they were going to lose the UASF contest.

It's against miner's interest to make any changes at all. They're earning maximum fees now, and don't seem to be interested in preserving their future earnings.
It kinda makes sense too, if they aren't planning to upgrade their Asics again in 4-6 months like miners usually have to do to stay competitive.
Will you personally accept their decision to keep blocks at 1MB, keep fudding segwit/LN, and even have a major drop in the hashrate later, leaving bitcoin insecure?

I can't disagree, but I do feel that Jihan has not yet accepted that fees are dropping fast enough to do something about. Segwit signaling is going in the wrong direction for him now; when it is time for him to finally panic, he could do anything, including embrace segwit or go mine the next highest-value PoW coin. We just don't know, and he's likely very scared of the decision... Putting it off as long as possible.


Which won't be the highest price if he keeps being scared or trying to fight. He must give in and signal Segwit for the market to rise again, period.


I hope you're right! But I don't know how much Pride and Ego Jihan has, so I am not sure yet.


The economic majority, pretty much every bitcoin wallet, and 94% of bitcoin's nodes are firmly against a BU hard fork. The latter is most certainly not close to activation, even if Jihan's hasrate grows to 95%.


Who was talking about non-contentious hard forks? The last one was in march 2013. I don't think we'll be seeing another, ever. 


Did Jihan's greed and scheming teach you nothing? I'd love to believe that all miners would agree to simply upgrade to 2MB blocks and we suddenly have 95% consensus, but the world keeps 
slapping me down as a reminder that different people have different goals for bitcoin. We can't force them, and we can't count on them. Scaling will simply have to take place off-chain, and I literally can't see any way around that fact. 


I don't dislike HFs in of themselves... I'd love to see bitcoin upgraded properly, maybe 8mb Blocks and no technical debt... That would be awesome! - Unfortunately, I haven't been able to believe that an attempt to HF bitcoin would result in anything less than a major, govt-sponsored attack since I read several central bank papers, including the Fed and BIS, and the UN and EU, all talk about how bitcoin cannot be stopped... Except by a 51% attack.

Lightning would monetarily benefit those who open payment channels, but they're parking their capital making it less liquid, so I say more power to those people.

Missing issues:
A. No mention of the incredible dangers HFs during contention present anywhere. BU-4 doesn't even begin to describe them or hint of their importance. We could all easily lose everything overnight. (And everyone in bitcoin knew this before the debate.)
B. Segwit is a pretty instant fix once miners signal at 95%. The rest of the community, nearly ever wallet including blockchain.info, has their code in place now.
C. To scale to mainstream use on chain would easily take Terrabyte-sized blocks. Even if hard disks were infinite, bandwidth would make them nearly impossible to use.
D. Segwit contains TONS of fixes, many for scaling and some for other problems. While BU folks see this as "complicated," the rest of us feel that makes it even more important to hurry up and get passed.
E. If you carefully read the HK agreement, you'll see that they agreed to a HF, if needed, AFTER segwit was activated.
F. The importance of Peer-review is understated drastically. This is science, not art.
G. You missed an important Cypherpunk in your 2-man list of 'figure heads for Segwit' - Blockstream's CEO, Adam Back, wrote a very large, important part of Bitcoin which Satoshi credited in his whitepaper.
H. The link between Core and Blockstream is a conspiracy theory that many of us laugh at every day as if it were flat eartherism. Blockstream's 6 employees at Core are just a tiny drop in the bucket of the 100+ devs in core with code accepted today or the 420 devs who have submitted code to core. More importantly, there is only one blockstream employee, Sipa, who has an all-important commit key, and he has sworn off using it for Scaling issues. (Greg Maxwell used to have another key but he turned his in to avoid this bullshit.)

We agree on many points, but to not know why we would not hard fork to raise the block size, even to a small number like 2MB, is to literally not know what core devs are defending against.
HARD FORKS are the enemy, not large blocks. If you polled all core devs today about what size the blocks should be set to, you'd get an average somewhere around 4MB. 
A HF, meanwhile, can cripple or even destroy bitcoin in a controversial environment. Even if Jihan was a great guy and didn't need to attack bitcoin while it's hash rate was split in half like that, it leaves Bitcoin open to attack from it's Real enemies; banks and governments.

I agree miners wouldn't "move" to BTU... But since BTU is an altcoin, and the exchanges say they must, for technical reasons, keep it separate from Bitcoin, The miners who stay on bitcoin are only supporting the Core dev's coin.

It took us 8 years of hard work to make bitcoin into a money. The public is starting to believe that it's actually digital scarcity. If we don't split it into two coins, they'll see that Satoshi did indeed invent files that can't be copied, and a money that can't be counterfeited.

I'll take that as a no, since it obviously would not have the mining power behind it. The point is that when the chains split, half the mining power goes over to the other chain and bitcoin will be weak, almost defensless from attack. Citibank, Venezuela, or the PBoC want to shut bitcoin down for good? Here's our neck on a silver platter for them.


But which is which? Both might be affected. Replay attacks might become normal.


I don't care what happens after the split; bitcoin would be DOA in investors minds at the split itself. They'll instantly lose faith in bitcoin as a store of value because it can be split and split again and so on.

The real risk in a HF is letting the world see what it perceives as 42m "Bitcoins" after a "stock split." If they see that then the whole concept of digital scarcity is a myth to them and investors will decide that blockchain technology is useless.
However, since Shapeshift and another 20 exchanges, last Friday, agreed to immediately and automatically call the BU fork a mere altcoin called "BTU," then the disaster sounds like it is averted. The Bitcoin brand won't be ruined by BU, unless of course Jihan also does an empty block attack on the the main chain. 
(However, Core devs are threatening to fork away to an ASIC-Firing POW in that case, so we seem to be at a point where Jihan won't attack, and have to act honorably when his minions attempt to split the chain, which simply creates an altcoin called BTU.)
Note how nothing I've said here depends on majority hashrate. We seem to be at some kind of stalemate that simply depends on the temperament of madmen.

1. Therefore the coins split. Even if not, we'd be weakening bitcoins for it's REAL enemies out there to take advantage of the lowered hashrate. HFs are VERY unsafe, even if we all play nicely.
2. Emergent consensus is a risky plan that hasn't been tested. It's a very different consensus mechanism than the one we use today, calling for miners to have more power and be able to kick out other mining power they don't like.
3. Search around, the stories of it are everywhere.

You don't say? Miners support the option that gives only miners far more power and can even kick miners out if they don't like them? Unbelievable!


Incorrect. 
I agree that when the price falls enough they'll be forced to do something then. 


True, but you assume that when the time comes, they'll do something specific, yet we don't know what their reaction will be. Maybe they'll HF and mine empty blocks on Core chain? Maybe they'll signal Segwit? Maybe they'll all go mine another Sha256 altcoin? We are guessing.


1. There is no benefit from the censorship other than producing the quality code you admitted to, since there are no Blockstream people in those roles.
2. What else would it look like if a bunch of people that have no idea how to code and also happen to be anti-freedom, power-hungry ambition, went up against a meritocracy based on freedom?   Of course they're going to go and cry and tell the world that they were treated unfairly. 


No one, not one single core dev, is happy about how long it has taken to scale. Not one. Even Luke-jr, who wants to make the block size smaller, is pissed and mad at other core devs for blocking consensus. ALL of them are.
Starting to get the idea of what a meritocracy is yet? They're all individuals. This is not the borg. They can work together to produce code, but they cannot enforce people to adopt it.
Remember, Satoshi was the last person to set the block size. Most core devs have worked for years to raise it but it's just really freaking hard.


Que pasa?  They're always fighting about it. You just don't recognize it because a meritocracy isn't what you were expecting.


Agreed. All 420 of them think they're right. So does Roger, So does Jihan, and so does each individual BU dev. 
Sucks, don't it? Damn human nature. But it doesn't mean the 420 can think as one.


Unfounded fear. I've even seen that threat made on the devlist... But you know what? The majority of the devs, calm and collected as always, simply shunned the person making it. Didn't give him the time of day. The top devs very much care about decentralization and freedom values. That goes against it.


Lol, Armstrong has been a vocal Big blocker for years and the only 'banning' that happened was redditors picked on him exactly as much as usual.
...Not after 21 or so other exchanges, including Shapeshift, said first that BTU will automatically be assigned to BU's chain without human intervention. A similar number have done the same since.... ZERO have said they'll do the opposite... Because it's technically infeasible. Armstrong will learn after an hour or less of missing revenue that he's forced to follow suit, and that's why everyone made fun of his announcement.


99.999% of everyone on both sides of the issues feel this way. The rest are extremists, and unfortunately one of those extremists is in control of what will soon be Majority hashing power.


Any hard fork gives bitcoin's actual enemies a door to attack. Hashingpower is cut and the blockchain is vulnerable to an enemy with what usually isn't enough power to attack. Banks and govts are now taking bitcoin seriously, so this is a scary idea. 
Plus, I learned more about Jihan. He may take the opportunity to do something stupid like mine empty blocks on Core's chain to ensure he is the emporer of bitcoin. That could really suck, not just because of the death of the original chain, but the response would be like nuclear elevation... DDoS attacks, hacker armies, and eventually hitmen would probably be involved. Scary stuff, sure to kill public perception of the whole space. Why not avoid it all and go for a soft fork?

Good luck, we desperately need this.
So you know what you're up against, let me tell you about my day.
I started out on the Dev slack channel, asking if a compromise could be found. Even if we ONLY give BU folks what we've already given in segwit but smaller, such as only the block size raise as a soft fork.
No takers. None. All said some variation of either it shouldn't be us to compromise, or they can't see miners ever doing something that unprofitable.
So I took it to facebook, and called out a bunch of FB friends who are bitcoiners on both sides. Around 20 showed up. More BU folks showed up than core folks.
I asked them all if they'd be willing to make the same compromise, just a block size increase from a soft fork.
Still no takers.  Well, one kinda, but he's a newbie without much of a formed opinion yet. (He hadn't chosen a side.)
The BU folks all objected to Core Devs breathing.
Ethereum's starting to have as much volume now as bitcoin, and there is no possible compromise in sight that I can see. 
I believe this day may even go down in history as the turning point for bitcoin... Unless we do something drastic the social community and probably miners are never going to let block sizes raise, and compromise is too much to ask.
I wonder if we all chipped in for an official UN negotiator, could we even get the two sides to show up to the table?

The meritocracy of core developers that have had control over bitcoin since Satoshi are the target of slander and lies and ridicule by Roger Ver, Top miner Jihan Wu, and the entire community over at r/btc that listen to those lies.
They've attempted a coup with a new development team using an extremely buggy peice of software called "Bitcoin Unlimited," but the Exchanges stepped in and put an end to their coup a week ago by saying that BU's chain would only trade as an altcoin called BTU.
They don't believe it yet, but their effort is done... Now we just want to get those miners signalling for Segwit so we can start to scale bitcoin properly.

"The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit."

It might be more important to note the distribution of the all-important Commit keys.
Out of all of the 100+ Core devs active these days, only two Blockstream employees have had Commit keys; Sipa and Gmax. 
Greg turned his in a year ago to avoid the possible controversy.
Peter says he won't use his for scaling issues, also to avoid the controversy.
So next time you see someone spouting ye olde conspiracy theory, be sure to ask them how Blockstream plans to pull off their devious plans with no commit keys?

1. Your answer sounds like you haven't imagined what a contentious hard fork would be like. Jihan &amp; Ver's camp would exclaim that they have made the "true" bitcoin as satoshi described it. A good Quarter of the total hashpower or more would head over and mine that chain, at a loss. (This is obvious since both Jihan and Ver are already mining at a loss.) They cannot and will not reach 75%, but nor will Segwit reach 95%. This all assumes some other, more desperate fork takes place in response. There will be no chain death, unless, of course, a very large percentage of the Core miners successfully mine enough empty blocks on top of BU's smaller chain. It doesn't look like BU will have the power to do the same to Core. In the end: Investors will see a nerdfight and not trust any bitcoin at all anymore. There will be no stability or integrity either way. Sub $1 forever, period.
2. They do, but emergent consensus brings in new risks with miners assuming more power. What if Jihan decided to 'pick off' one by one all the miners he didn't like?
3.  The criticism has been voiced, and only heard by the side that wants to hear it. I personally don't know how bad the code is, but Devs like Peter Todd have said it's so bad that it can't pass basic consistency tests. Frankly I'd just like to see some real peer review on the matter.

We both know that's technically what it is, but to virtually all investors, BTC will be there unchanged and BTU will be listed as a separate, seemingly unconnected altcoin. What advantage does being a fork of bitcoin give it in trader's eyes?


No doubt about that. I'm sure we'd be above $6k right now if not for the block size debate.


IF Jihan really wants that. Reading over his Weibo revelations this week, it's becoming apparent that he only wants us to stay at 1MB so he gets max Fee income forever unless Core devs meet him on his terms and offer him a way to replace his "lost" income while scaling up to lighting. 
I don't think a fork will happen now. Everyone realizes that their coins could go to $1.

Stop using appeals to authority and think for yourself.
In this contentious environment, what chances does the blockchain have of not being split into two coins during a hard fork? Even Ethereum, which has FAR fewer enemies, split into two coins, and it wasn't even trying to be money. The prize was far smaller.
Bitcoin's enemies are legion. Basically every bank and government. Are you so sure that none of them would take advantage of a contentious hard fork and use that moment of weakness to attack?

They agreed in HK for a risky blocksize increase to 2MB. Developers found a way to give them More than 2MB and do it without the risk.
And hell yes, Segwit is an actual block size raise that makes blocks, including signature data and everything, larger than 2MB in size. You can see them on testnet for yourself.

1. Doesn't matter how fast it dies; all investor confidence is lost as soon as there are 42 million possible bitcoins.  Bitcoin won't exist the next day other than a collector's item.
2. From the whitepaper: [Miners] "expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them." Satoshi concluded. "Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism." &lt;- the often overlooked, important bit. (Why I don't like UASF, too)
3. It's about feedback. Core devs have looked at it, but when they try to explain flaws they find to BU devs, they're met with scorn and refusal to listen.

To be a dev in cryptocurrencies you have to add another dimension to all considerations. The Monetary pressure creates economic incentives for the humans using your code to behave differently at every little change you make.
It's way deeper than just "miners work for a block reward..." Many core devs may still not get it all, and to further compound it, some will understand Economics as Keynesian and others (more around here) as Austrian, which are incompatible ways of understanding how humans are driven by incentives.
tl:dr: It's a mess and our devs are f*cking rock-star-superheroes for getting so much right.

I can understand the position, and in normal circumstances, I'd back it fully.
But now that BU is closed-source code, where once activated, the Dev team could literally forward all ShapeShift trades to their own, personal bitcoin addresses, do you feel that allowing the miners to push BU on us all is anything other than an extremely reckless and hostile attack?

Force through? You still don't get it.
Miners are now forced to choose between leaving bitcoin for an altcoin called BTU versus staying with bitcoin where the big money is. It's that simple, although Jihan obviously doesn't get it yet.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:46:27
It does imply that bitcoin cannot scale _when there is contention._ 
Contentious hard forks are exactly what will have happened when Jihan makes his new altcoin BTU.  Sure, it's just an altcoin and he didn't steal bitcoin... But he will have split the hashing power, leaving bitcoin vulnerable to enemy attack... Which is still the Core Dev team's  job to defend against.

Yesterday we saw 5 out of 15 Antpool blocks signalling BU. That means we saw 1/3rd of Wu's mining power in Antpool turned on. Did the share of antpool move 25% or even 10% out of core and into BU? No. It was less than 2%.
That means all of antpool mining BU will take their score up 6%. (4% more from now) which is still below 30% of the total hashrate.
There are still far too many miners using pre-segwit core and not participating in the debate. Maybe 50% of all miners.

Gold has been well spread and accepted among all mankind for thousands of years. The 180 degree line you're talking about represents a very solid rate of inflation in a completely homogenized market.
Bitcoin is like gold before people who live far away from the mines ever heard of gold. We've still got 7.2 Billion people left to convince that it's a good investment, and in the meantime, it's actually far more scarce than gold is.
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:22:22
The scaling debate is temporary. We'll get past it soon after BU fails... Their money and other support will certainly run out at some point.
The Fungibility debate, to take place afterwards, is far scarier IMHO. Bitcoin will clearly be better with more fungibility and anonymity is required for that. Just like dollars, we need each unit to stop leaving a trace on the blockchain for forensic teams to follow.
Do you imagine governments will be cool with an upgrade to bitcoin that removes that nice history for them to follow? They'll come down hard on the only thing they have any control over... Exchanges. I bet in most countries bitcoin exchanges for fiat will be outlawed, and big companies like Coinbase would go out of business.
Therefore, Exchanges will Fight -HARD- against any fungibility upgrade, and so will miners because they need the money exchanged. 
It could be a huge fight, but in the end anonymity will never become part of bitcoin. Thankfully, wallets like Samourai cannot be stopped. I bet we'll see more like them, and eventually govts will start hunting them.

A.) Mining issues? I was talking about how investors and the public will react. Remember, bitcoin was a promise to the world that digital information, for the first time, could be made scarce. That's bitcoin's true value proposition... Money was useless online because it wasn't possible to make digits scarce... Bitcoin changed that, and a Hard Fork that turns into two bitcoins like Ethereum's split can undo that promise in the public's mind.  - They'll see 42 Million bitcoins and who knows how many more next week. -Satoshi will have lied to the world. The price could never recover from this no matter how well bitcoin technically functions.
C.) This is simple math. We're currently doing around 3 transactions a second as we fill up big 1MB blocks, right? So 6 tps would mean 2MB blocks, 1GB blocks = 3000 TPS. Meanwhile, just the Visa card network alone was doing 24,000 TPS back in 2010: 
 
And then there are all the other credit cards like MC, Discover, Amex, and then alllllll those debit cards and so on and so on. Millions of tps are needed for global scaling if we're to keep the fees low.
On-chain scaling was never, ever, EVER going to take us to mainstream adoption. Satoshi didn't get a chance to work on scaling before he was frightened away so we can't know how he would have scaled it. We do know he invented payment channels, so Lightning seems to be a good bet if we still believe in Satoshi. We have to do the rest ourselves.

The difference is that we're referring to the former as a coin when it's actually just a blockchain. A Blockchain that can send unvalued transactions around, but without valuing them, and 'tokenizing' them which happens at exchanges, we can't really call them coins. They're just blockchain placeholder bits, and we have a rough idea of them being coins without anything solidifying that idea.

Lightning was built for consumer convenience first and foremost. Yes, it's far more private than an on-chain bitcoin TX because only you and the receiver see the private info on each TX... But if that receiver is an exchange or other AML/KYC-following entity, it's not really that private.
Liquid was designed for whales and other traders who don't want their buys and sells telegraphed to other traders, lest they lose the advantage in the markets. To do that Blockstream actually implemented Confidential Transactions, a very strong form of mixing coins, between the federated partners of the liquid network.

2. P&amp;D is hard to time; not nearly as sure to earn as hodling.
3. More than a few people are here for ideological reasons... Sure we want to make money too, but we don't necessarily want to make more dollars...

This is simply backwards... Bitcoin enables More financial privacy, not less.
Why would some thug find out you have your savings on a trezor or paperwallet, which no one but you has to know even exists at all? 
Compare that to a bank branch... Lots of people there could see you deposit or withdraw large amounts of paper dollars. Any one of them could talk and that info find its' way to the thug you're trying to avoid.
I suppose one day when the banks are long gone, then it would be safe for a thug to assume that anyone who looks rich would have bitcoins stored somewhere outside of a bank... But then there's so many options for hiding and protecting them at that point.
My fave idea is Julian Assange's Rubberhose file system, but put on an android phone. If you put in one pin  you get your normal wallet, but change that number by just one digit and you get a totally different file system holding a different wallet that could be empty or holding a far smaller amount.
In time we'll get physical (probably NFC-based) items that are tiny but carry our private keys, which can be hidden in plain sight like earrings, buttons, cufflinks, etc. They can even be shielded so they can't be scanned for, ensuring that no one can find them without knowing what to look for. With those you can make very interesting security routines indeed.
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:44:11
You're missing the point entirely. With Lightning, it's about who your transaction is being made to... Of course they can see what you sent them, they have it. They can also see how much else you have in that channel and your other channels. (Probably not in  your cold storage though.) What they choose to do with that data isn't up to you.
With Liquid there is supposed to be more control over your privacy via coin mixing throughout the federated nodes, and there is no channel balance data for them to see.

The term "2nd layer" is from internet networking... It predates bitcoin by at least 2 decades.
When the internet first made its debut in the 1970's, it was exactly like bitcoin's protocol in structure. (On the first layer.) When someone wanted to place information on the internet in those days, they broadcast their info to EVERY NODE ON THE INTERNET, exactly like bitcoin broadcasts every transaction to every node on bitcoin's network.
In the 1980's, TCP/IP was born. It is a 2nd layer that doesn't change the underlying internet protocol. Certain 'high level' data is still broadcast-to-everyone only, like DNS data... Bitcoin will always have that layer that we call "on-chain" to work in exactly the same way.
TCP/IP, still the major routing protocol of the internet today, obviously doesn't make everyone's browser receive every packet on the internet. It makes direct tunnels between requesters and providers of information. Sound familiar?
That's exactly what Lightning was designed to do.
Also like the internet, other 2nd layer networks, or alternative to the Lightning Network, exist on bitcoin now as well. Exchanges and whales now use the sidechain known as Liquid to keep real bitcoins moving off-chain. RSK is another sidechain. Technically every exchange has it's own off-chain little network in the form of a centralized spreadsheet to move bitcoins around internally. And of course, you can also use a visa card, simply by using bitcoins to pay the bill...
These all work as ways to move bitcoin value around the world without adding more TXs to the bitcoin blockchain... Some are more centralized than others. Even if they were all centralized solutions though, having 1000 centralized solutions is a form of decentralization too... Just don't get too dependant on any one of them.

In my 5+ years of bitcoining, I've given this topic more thought than any other. While bitcoin being a store of value with a payment network attached is truly the killer app we'll all find most useful, that still doesn't answer the question of what form it will take when your grandmother decides to download the app and trust it with her money.
Our focus needs to be on the class of 'killer apps' that face the end users and offer them something they can't get without bitcoin being used. 
Brave is certainly one of them, if they ever get around to doing the BTC part right.
21's market will be absolutely huge, and could actually create an economy than no human can afford to not join in... But it'll take time to build it up.
OpenBazaar needs some serious marketing to get there, but it's on the right track to take a share away from ebay, etsy, amazon, and the like, Eventually it could put bitcoin on every phone.
Code Valley &amp; Rein also have an awesome plan to re-invent the software economy in one fell swoop. The number of jobs that could provide is far beyond anyone's dreams here. Again, waiting on code and marketing.
There's about a dozen or so of these markets/economies/apps that could each change the world to absolutely depend on bitcoin daily. More will come in time, too.
Bitcoin will go mainstream when those apps do and people find themselves needing to buy bitcoin to take part in them. Then, as the market (and bitcoin's price) grows, investors will feel more secure in their hodling, and buy more, and we'll see it snowball from there.  There will be a tipping point, and I suspect it'll be in the next 1-3 years.

If you plan to spend them from time to time buy a hardware wallet like the Trezor, Keepkey, or Ledger Nano S.
Hardware wallets make spending coins safer than you can be with an electrum wallet alone. Paper wallets are actually the safest thing you can do right now but they don't allow for spending without sweeping the whole balance back up into a software wallet again.

It's easy to see a headline like "Venezuelans are mining bitcoins to eat" or "Columbia bitcoin market is skyrocketing" and decide in your mind that what the author says inside is that those economies are about to go mainstream, with a wallet in every household.
That's just laziness though. The former piece was literally just a few miners making some money while hiding their mining operation, while the latter was about an uptick in the exchange trade on localbitcoins... 
To really judge the whole economy for taking off, there are like a hundred data points to consider... Mining, nodes, LBC trade, Exchange volumes, # of exchanges, remittance flows - both ways, legal acceptance, meetup group attendance, facebook groups, reasons for the surge, etc.... You really have to have your ear to the tracks on many different stats daily to see a real one coming.
I enjoy writing about them because they're so different from each other. Switzerland's got the exact opposite problem that Venezuela has, for instance, but they're both surging in bitcoin volumes and their meetup groups are swelling every week.
I also enjoy spotting the places where bitcoin Should break out, such as Suriname. Wow, what a ticking bitcoin time bomb that place is! 
I don't think anyone in Suriname knows what a bitcoin is, but their inflation is like 75% percent a month right now and everyone in the tiny country has two smartphones... Plus, they speak dutch, and the Dutch are extremely bitcoin-friendly. -If the right dutch-speaking entrepreneur went in there and spread the good word, oh my they could have a revolution in weeks.

Not with bitcoin it doesn't. There is no 3 year period in Bitcoin's life that wasn't a massive gain.

There is $7.1 trillion in gold on earth today. It's a pile roughly the size of a big single-family house.
Bring down a few more houses worth of gold, and that $7t mostly goes into bitcoin overnight as the gold price sinks to nearly nothing.
Actually, it's better than that, because those asteroids aren't homegenously made up of gold ore... They've got platinum, silver, molybedium, and lots of other precious metals and compounds in them, potentially tanking their prices too. 
There's a finite # of bitcoins, so $7t worth would be 500x our present price in bitcoin, roughtly. (~$460,000 per bitcoin)

So much bullshit in the post. OP, Bitcoin is truly not for you.
1. There are literally hundreds of exchanges now, and those four people you mentioned primarily spoke english, whereas today 98% of the global bitcoin volume comes from China and Japan. So no, they aren't "Owned by the same early adopters."
2.  22% is a helluva number to pull out of your ass, especially since Satoshi could have sent his to a black hole address and clearly hasn't moved however many he did mine. Winklevoss' fund will by tying up their coins, and Roger has been spending his like crazy on things like a Yellow Lamborghini in Tokyo and apparently a lot of fulltime trolls.
3. 22% isn't an important metric, however. Who recieves the new money in a system is the only important metric... Old money gets spent eventually, but newly-made money gives those living today their power. So far humankind has only given the new money to the Oligarcy in every country to date. Bitcoin doesn't do that. Go mine for yourself and see.
4. Anyway, actual wealth inequality is WAAAAAY worse than 22%... It's More like 85% in the USA!

It'll be more than a couple of years before the IRS gets blockchain-analyzing tools to track money outside of the dollar-and-bank system. By then bitcoin will have more privacy and you can always use things like coin mixers too on your stash. It's going to be an interesting few years watching them try to catch up and realized they never will be able to. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:43:34
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:42:26
I have really mixed feelings about that viewpoint. On the one hand, it's only temporary because bitcoin's becoming much more private soon with lightning, liquid, and privacy improvements to the core protocol. And of course the added legitimacy that the IRS could bring to bitcoin is pretty major... Everyone has to do their taxes and will see the forms for turning in their pub IDs! Let's see Roubini keep calling it a scam then!
On the other hand, I doubt anyone has really kept a really good record of their BTC transactions... This could go really wrong for every bitcoin user if they decided to take it seriously.

Nothing in this universe is impervious to every threat. In fact, before bitcoin came along, Gold was the best store of value if you stuck it in a solid safe... And Hid the safe from burglars.
Bitcoin is more flexible than that, but you have to spend more than a dime to make it more safe than that. Without spending any money you have exactly one thing to try to make your wallet impregnable, but there is added risk: A very well-made brainwallet.
Brainwallets aren't safe at all if you don't do a stellar job of creating the seed phrase. I mean really, really good. Spend all afternoon on it, learn a lot about real cryptography before even trying.
That would work, but it's not a practical solution, because obviously you can't spend from your brain... You'd still need a software wallet to sweep your brainwallet into from time to time to make spends from.
As for the Trezor backup, lots of fireproof safes out there can do a good job of guarding your seed phrase. If you're really, really paranoid about it, stamp the seed phrase into a metal sheet, perhaps with a dog tag maker or some other metal stamping kit... And safeguard those instead of paper.
Remember, Trezors &amp; Keepkeys exist because you need to spend bitcoins, not for any other reason.

Wow. I can easily sum up everything you say above as "We poor little peons are being screwed over by the evil oppressors in full control of our money."
It's like you pretend that you nor anyone else are allowed to become an expert and modify bitcoin's code.
The most important difference between bitcoin and government-controlled fiat currencies is the very fact that you, yes, you coinling, and everyone else on the planet too, are 100% able to modify that code and change it's behavior if you have something useful to add. 
With government fiat, your attitude was appropriate... Nobody you'll ever meet will be allowed to modify anything about the US dollar, for instance. Only the top 1% of the 1% of the Oligarchy has any say over how that system behaves.
Bitcoin is an extremely rare black swan event that has changed humankind's ability to have power over their money. It is literally the most incredible thing that will happen in terms of human freedom in your lifetime, and it's not good enough for you!

The Tax-incentivized charity that happens today is a teeny-tiny fragment of what it once was before americans started socializing everything in the early 1900s and basically destroyed what charity once was.
Here's a preacher's classic speech about that from the 1970's:
Note how many different ways charity is lessened by government meddling... It's not just one thing that decimated charity; it's like 20, all at once.
There's another factor that easily gets discarded because we don't remember a time before income taxes. (Also invented in the early 1900s) With more wealthy people around, the overall money in the economy was bigger... So a similar-sized slice of a much bigger pizza would have much more food to give to the poor: 
I'm not interested in convincing Thiel or Buffet to give away 30% and see it used up quickly in direct aid... I'd MUCH rather see them use that money on building something that benefits everyone, while allowing those entrepreneurs to make a profit too. There are millions of these around us today like private hospitals and parks, toll roads, a million foundations to help cure cancer or feed the poor, etc. This tactic of keeping them private for the sake of bettering society sounds far-fetched to a lot of socialists, but only because the government typically annexes this sort of thing and then raises taxes to pay for it instead of letting the market decide what those things are worth.

It's still fledgling for many reasons. Like Andreas Antonopoulos says all the tome, People who have (relatively) stable money, like the USD or EUR, find bitcoin way to inconvenient. The US public doesn't need bitcoin because today, in 2017, it can't do many things that they are used to getting now from their precious credit cards, like get accepted everywhere, offer advance credit, and even simple gimmicks like cash back on purchases. These are the people who WANT chargebacks to occur, so that they can take advantage of merchants, too.
Yes, those sound like a bunch of horrible ideas to us 1%ers (actually we're far fewer than a whole percent) but the fact is that the US mainstream public has different priorities than we do and theirs are in line with US Dollars.
That can change fast though, as 30+ countries in the world right now with monetary problems fully understand. One day those priorities will be forced to change.

We've simply thought it out and can easily see that it's still a fledgling, crippled, child-like currency today that no one will use yet... At least not in the 1st world.
...But it has promise to be the ONLY currency in the world if we can just ensure people use it as a store of value and then modify bitcoin to be able to handle the transaction load needed for 7 billion people to use.
Austrian economics shows clearly (look at Menger's regression theorem) that money must be a good store of value before it can be a currency. That's how gold became money.
If it's not a store of value, then 0 out of 7 billion people will want to use it no matter how awesome a 'currency' it is. Imagine of BBQ coin or Dogecoin could handle Visa's transactions daily... Would people switch from the dollar to dogecoin?  I bet you know the answer to that.

In Mises' regression theory (The origin of how all money is made) you have to have a valuable commodity first before real money can come about.
Gold was appreciated for it's unique properties before people used it as money. Bitcoin is following it's footsteps perfectly, except that the early developers made the mistake of calling it a "Cash system," which was a bit premature. Satoshi should have called it gold 2.0.

First of all, do you plan on spending it?
If you're only hodling for the long haul, there is no purpose in getting a hardware wallet because hardware wallets exist only to make spending from cold storage safer.

There are some smaller parts of bitcoin's cryptography that Devs plan to upgrade in order to ensure against such threats, but the overall safety of the system (i.e. cracking private keys) is secured by numbers so large that mankind will not likely ever be able to create a computer powerful enough to count that high.

Lol; the price of gold is worth nothing if people lose faith in it.
I guess we just disagree too much on how the public would react to bitcoin splitting. I'm quite convinced that it is the ultimate dealbreaker. There is no greater promise bitcoin has made to the world than the fact that it cannot inflate, and every investor that has come to it to date has done so believing their money is safe in bitcoin because it's that one, rare, truly capped commodity/investment. 
If we have spent the last 8 years lying to them about that, they're going to HATE bitcoin, with a passion, and us along with it, and make sure it's nothing but a precautionary tale in every textbook forever afterwards.
In fact, I think it may very well be the end of cryptocurrencies altogether.

I'm not saying that Jimmy's advice is ideal, but I can't deny having to do exactly this myself sometimes because credit cards to make an awesome 2nd layer for bitcoin today. You'd have to be a fool out of touch with what consumers want to not see that one day we'll wind up with credit cards exactly like these today but paid for in/with bitcoin.
I get the 'we need to promote bitcoin as a payment system' angle, but the fact is that bitcoin isn't one yet, and we've got a ways to go before it is one. Deny it all you want, that's the world you live in currently and it's only going to change after the mainstream has accepted bitcoin as a Store of Value first... Without that, there is no way for bitcoin to become money.

I'm pretty psyched about Abra; it certainly fits the definition of killer app if it gets people otherwise not using bitcoin to use it and hold it.
There's something that no one else has been talking about that is uber-bullish here... Since these apps actually hold (or tie-up) bitcoin when there is any money on your phone, what will that do to the scarcity of bitcoin when everyone's got $20 worth of whatever currency on their phone in an Abra app?
7.2 billion people x $20 = The moon

The problem is that on-chain scaling is a faster fix, but a bad one.
Even the most extreme proposals show that on-chain scaling will only give us a tiny few more % of transactions, and was never designed to take bitcoin global. There would be gigabytes of transactions every minute for a visa-sized network.
The more transactions stored on chain, the fewer people that can afford to run a node, since they have to store far more transactions.

I think your problem is that you can't see how the public reacts to things. Maybe you're too young or too out of touch with society. The vast majority of the public isn't going to take the time to find out if the reporters and economists that talk about bitcoin now being split into two different coins for a total of 42 million are accurate; they'll just mentally say to themselves, "yeah, sounded like a scam, glad to see it's proven so I don't have to think about it again." 
The people who had a little faith in it (not the true hodlers, but the ones just coming around in the last year) might ask a few questions, but more often than not they'll simply dump whatever they've gotten so far because it's too much to worry about and we may just be elaborately scamming them.
The true hodlers like me will even have a tough time because our coins will drop to $1 or less in a day or two. Sure, you can always say you'll buy them by the hundred at that price, but in the meantime, vendors have all stopped using them, ETFs like Barry's will have closed down, 95% of the infrastructure businesses like coinbase will have rolled back up their onramps and probably went bankrupt, and wallets will stop being supported.
It'll be HARD to keep being a hodler, and there probably won't be any reward for doing so.

Simply put:
* Liquid is a high-volume network that moves bitcoins between exchanges and traders mainly. It's not really for you to use at all, at least not yet. It's the more private of the two networks, and it will take more of the immediate TX load off bitcoin's blockchain as more exchanges sign up.
* Lightning IS for you to use; you'll see it popping up in most wallets before long. It's got tiny fees and is far more private than bitcoin alone - But not perfect privacy.
Both are on the 2nd layer, but their networks are designed very differently. The former is a federated sidechain while the latter is like a big network of bar tabs.

I'm a bit anxious, and I do think it's Bitcoin related.
The world has never had a money before that couldn't be taken away. It's also never had a global money before that could teleport across the internet to any payee without restrictions.
Commerce is kind of a big deal. Just Bitcoin and OpenBazaar alone could change humanity in ways we can't imagine yet, by basically giving two thirds of the world their first-ever bank account and letting them sell their products or service to a global market... Think of all the new wealth in the world that will create!
But more importantly, bitcoin is there for people when their local currency tanks. If the Venezuela hyperinflation had happened ten years from now instead, surely everyone there would be familiar with bitcoin and save their wealth in it instead of riding the Bolivar down to its grave. 
Interestingly, an average of 3 economies are collapsing at any given time in the world. There will be a whole lot of chances for the population of some failing country, or the whole Eurozone for that matter, to hop on board the bitcoin express.
Also, in the past rich people only had offshore bank accounts to hide the big wealth in, and that wealth is something like 70 Trillion dollars today.
Switzerland has already punted all of these folks, and the Panama papers leak has shown them that they're identity isn't safe anywhere, in fact. ...But they'll soon learn that bitcoin was made for this need. In fact, bitcoin will give that 70 Trillion dollars worth of wealth new and exciting features that may define the next century.

Segwit is 2.1 to 4mb explicitly as a start, because the core devs say even more will be needed for lightning soon.

Things show up on the blockchain when you send bitcoin from one address to another. So the stick will have one address, and your bitcoins will come from another address. Sending it from yours to the stick is one blockchain transaction, but handing the stick over physically doesn't show up at all to anyone. 
Later, your parents will destroy the stick and remove the coins, which would then send them to a third address.

Oh boy. 
If that's how devs learn that a HF would be contentious, then I'm about to sell all my coins.
I’m not just afraid of the fact that miners are signaling their preference for a known contentious client almost as much as others signal for segwit. 
I’m not just afraid that known contentious pools make up about the same % of the global hash power. 
I’m also not afraid that a very vocal minority on r/btc rabidly advocates in nearly every thread they post that “Bitcoin Core” must be “overthrown” and replaced with crappy devs that will enable 8 MB blocks in about 20 minutes flat.  
I am also not very afraid that the chinese mining community speaks Mandarin and basically everything I hear from their side of the wall is from English speakers like Mow and Lee who are always defending themselves from non-english blocksize debate attacks that sound pretty brutal. 
What I’m really afraid of is the big players like megabanks and governments who will all eventually realize that they have existential reasons to destroy bitcoin. If ANY of them, just one out of hundreds of them, are already aware that bitcoin can take their livelihood away, they’d simply do the following:
* Promote division in a channel like r/btc.
* Promote an alternative client like BU that ensures a HF.
* Buy up hashing power and an exchange like Poloniex/bitfinex.
* Wait for the HF, make it as contentious as imaginable, then issue a coin within hours on the new chain.
* Send out a press release that bitcoin isn’t scarce anymore. 
Boom, no more Trust in the currency. Bitcoin is dead, or at least sub-$1 for eternity.
I don’t think Any cryptocurrencies would survive this attack… All currency works for trust, and as soon as the world learns that cryptocurrency isn’t scarce and Satoshi is a “liar,” then cryptocurrencies will forever be known as game-able and useless. - At least proof of work cryptocurrencies.
I expect the Devs to steer us away from HFs at all costs… At least until a day comes when bitcoin no longer has powerful enemies.

They can create it, and they can even demand that taxes be paid in it; but as long as it can be exchanged for bitcoins, the public can earn bitcoin and save bitcoin, avoiding paying a lot of taxes.
Therefore, they simply won't be able to extract so many trillions of dollars of taxes from us each year and their currency will be avoided by all until tax day... And with so little usage, what's the point? The govt will have to be holding considerable btc by then too to make payments to other countries... They'll need to collect that from people so at some point they'll simply be forced to give up on the failed fiat experiment.

Don't be ridiculous... It took them several years to perfect the pegged sidechain technology enough to launch this thing in beta... There were dozens of debates and competitors and it took all of blockstream's best minds to finally get this project on the table.  Do you really think that after all of that they just decided to run a coupon exchange system instead and have no real peg to bitcoin afterall?
Thankfully, you don't have to trust them on that. Here's the open source github repository with the Elements code that they use to make their pegged sidechains:
If you really want to know if Liquid is fully tied to bitcoin, read &amp; understand that code, and then sign up as a liquid beta tester (it's free) to download a node and see if they do it the same way.

You'd be daft to not get any coins, but also don't get more than you can afford to lose; bitcoin is still an experiment and despite 8 years of development we still don't know how high it can scale yet and a host of other factors that could limit it.
I'd suggest setting up a weekly auto-buy for an amount you won't miss. Maybe even just $10. That kind of steady investment smooths out the dips and peaks, so you don't have to worry about the price so much.

Well, I talk to a lot of people in the niche, but really what I'm basing that off is that people generally like to make more money, not less. Hodlers want their coins to go up in value, not down, and it's very widely believed that both lowered mining fees and ending the blocksize debate will each shoot the price moonward. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm what most people would call a 'small blocker.' I just hate the term because basically no one at all wants smaller blocks... We want the Devs to scale bitcoin properly, ASAP.

Haha, you're not that wrong about the echo chamber and it being a small representation. It's not my only playground though.
I'm really speaking in relative terms however... We can have over 5,000 people sign up to the sub in a day just because a BBC news story mentioned bitcoin, but a new service like Microsoft won't get many, if any, to stop by and say hello. 
Steam has probably been the biggest success story to date. I think you're the third person I've seen on here mention that that's where you came from.
...But my whole point was that earning bitcoins makes something a killer app. Care to guess how many people are on here that earn some kind of income, such as traders, writers (like me) and freelancers that are using bitcoin in the other direction? 
Let's just say that an app like Abra has the potential to double bitcoin's price in a week. I'm getting some popcorn for that launch.

Sidechains and other layer 2^ tech is going to wipe out most alts one day in the midterm future. Sure, there's some great tech out there, but that tech will be far more useful to everyone deployed as a valueless sidechain token carrying bitcoin's value than it will simply being a separate store of value.
With that in mind, there may be some alts that are doing things you don't want to do strapped to bitcoin, such as appcoins. There may also be some rare alts, like IOTA, that are newer tech than blockchains that will stay separate because enough people feel they have a real shot of overcoming bitcoin's network effect and replacing it someday. It would take decades for us to find out the answer to that, so I expect some will stick around for decades, win or lose.
BTW; Ether is flawed in so many ways that it's already long past it's shelf life now. If you're going to diversify, that's not the coin you're looking for.

And about the growth, remember, Satoshi made it what it is... 1MB limit and all. He knew damn well (and talked about it) that one day it would need to grow but he couldn't stick around for that. 
I don't blame him for leaving, I'd be scared shitless of Gavin meeting the CIA too if I were him... But the fact is that he left before bitcoin could Scale to meet global demand. He simply didn't finish it so wanting something that only happened because no users were using it yet is called sticking your head in the sand.

BashCo gets a bit emotional; I think his username is quite accurate. 
But I am convinced there is an extremely important reason to never hard fork bitcoin until bitcoin is in an existential risk situation like it was in 2010. I also believe, after personally talking with at least 5 core developers recently, that the entire dev community understands this purpose and would never accept code that doesn't reflect this fear of hard fork to get past their meritocracy.  You can watch this behavior unfold on the bitcoin dev mailing list.
The reason is this:  ALL currencies depend on the public trusting that they will retain their value tomorrow. Trust in a currency is the Primary fight that every currency must constantly battle, from gold to fiat to especially bitcoin, which people have a hard time trusting to retain value because they believe data to be intrinsically copy-able.
Bitcoin's worked long and hard to fight for the trust that it's gotten to date, and it may take 20 more years to get to the point where the public finally trusts it enough to save their wealth in bitcoin. -Which of course is needed to have a currency.
Events like MtGox hurt the public's trust so bad that it took two whole years to start the recovery process, and we still haven't technically rebounded the price in full yet.
Ethereum's hard fork didn't hurt ethereum's geek-centric user base so badly because it was never intended to be money. eth is just a token fee to power the network, not a way to pay starbucks and your mortgage.
They have different goals; and bitcoin's goal 100% relies on Public Trust.
Can you imagine what the public would say if there were suddenly bitcoin and bitcoin classic? Economists would go on TV and say "See, we told you bitcoins could be copied, there are now 42 Million bitcoins possible... I wonder how many there will be possible next year?"
Bitcoin would be DONE. Just from a single hard fork being contended. 
And there are, afterall, 18 Billion reasons for people (and governments!) to make bitcoin's hard fork contentious. They'll buy up server farms and exchanges just for the occasion.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:55:56
It's absolutely astounding that you think it's unlikely for a bitcoin hard fork, in this climate, wouldn't be the most contentious fork of all times in human history.
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:39:11
Most core devs have always known that hard forks are dangerous and will fight to defend bitcoin from the horrors that they bring. The agreement was not made with most devs.
Instead, they put a LARGER block size raise in Segwit. -And don't let any miguided fools that live in a FUDbubble tell you that segwit isn't a block size raise. It very much is and that's well proven.
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:05:40

@_date: 2017-01-20 18:38:44
You have been mislead. All of r/btc has.
The old line of code that says the limit looks like this:
MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000000;
It's still there today, but serves no purpose but to make sure no old clients break reading these nodes.
The new line of code that actually limits block sizes (in one way) is this:
MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE = 4000000;
Go check it; it's there.
It doesn't mean that blocks will reach a whole 4MB though; because there is a second limiter now... A block "Weight" of four million, which is a weighed average of a point scoring system they made up to judge transaction quality.
This weight score will allow it to fill up a block only if all transactions are well made with lots of the right kind of data; it loves P2SH transactions more, for instance.
TONS of testing has been done on testnet and the devs are confident that at today's levels of transactions, Segwit will reach an average of 2.1 MB blocks soon after being adopted.
If we have 2.1 mb blocks, then it is highly illogical to say that the max block size is still just 1 MB.
Therefore, Segwit raised the on-chain block size.

Think about a world with no more armored vans to move large amounts of money and no more security guards, vaults, bulletproof glass, guns for them to use, schools to train those guards, plants to manufacture those guns/trucks/glass, etc...

Core is the open source bunch of programmers, ~150 of them, mostly volunteering their time to maintain and scale bitcoin. They have produced all code for bitcoin to date, and exist in a developer's meritocracy, where the best code floats to the top and dangerous code is shunned.
Core produced and advocates an immediate upgrade using Segwit, which makes larger block sizes for more transactions to fit into each block more efficiently. 
Competing Bitcoin Unlimited developers and the whole r/btc community are scared of this solution because they believe in conspiracy theories about core being corrupted and bought out by a company called Blockstream. 
In truth, Blockstream is one of many companies that pay the salary of bitcoin core developers. It is employing 6 of them... Out of the 150... And none with the important commit keys.

I disagree that bitcoin will reach it's full price in 15 years or so. It'll take another 75 to absorb all the world's currencies and investments.




I don't see that as evidence of that at all, quite the opposite.
He had to have a target, but knew that each time it halved the price had to go up to pay for the mining industry. Sure fees would work into this too, I remember him saying that, but think about being a miner when the price halves... Every single four years it's the exact same thing... Miners will have the exact same choice to make every time, and the market will have the exact same series of events to respond to every single time.
What's the difference between the one 15 years from now and the one 19 years from now? Miners will see the two exactly the same.

That's great, I'm always glad to hear differing opinions that can read the code. -However, the Devs I spoke with were people who worked on Segwit... They wrote the changes we are discussing now.


Well, if all of that fits in 1 MB now, and will be fitting in 2.1 MB after segwit, then it sounds like quite an upgrade of the space that information is fitting in every 10 minutes, don't you agree? I think that fits the definition of a block size raise.


It sounds like you don't properly fear hard forks like they do, then. Soft forks may not be perfect, but at least they don't invite bitcoin's enemies inside to destroy the currency of bitcoin completely.
I'm really saddened to see that more people don't understand how fragile bitcoin - the currency- is to a loss of confidence when it hard forks. Scarcity is the most important attribute of a currency. 
If you fork bitcoin and another coin appears, most everyone will feel that bitcoin is not scarce. Afterall, 21 million coins will be 42 million in a matter of hours… What’s to stop that from turning to 84 million coins next week? (In the minds of the public)
Such a split will be an unmendable loss of trust of bitcoin’s primary promise as a currency to the world: It will make their value at risk if they choose to use it.
ALL currencies depend on the public trusting that they will retain their value tomorrow. Trust in a currency is the Primary fight that every currency must constantly battle, from gold to fiat and especially to bitcoin, which people have a harder time trusting to retain value because they believe data to be intrinsically copy-able.
Bitcoin proponents have worked very long and hard to fight for the trust that it's gotten thus far, and it may take 20 more years to get to the point where the global public finally trusts it enough to save their wealth in bitcoin. -Which of course is needed to have it become an actual, useful currency to all.
Events like MtGox hurt the public's trust so bad that it took two whole years to start the recovery process in full, and we still haven't technically rebounded the price in full yet.
Many argue that bitcoin’s hard fork could never be contentious like Ethereum's hard fork was, because of bitcoin’s 2-week adjustment period. Sadly, they are mistaken, because there is more than one attack that can be done to bitcoin in such a situation. 
During a hard fork, the attackers can simply buy up a lot of hashing power for the otherwise-discarded chain, have their exchange issue a coin for it, and start sending out press releases the moment it starts trading.
Ethereum’s first fork resulting in ETC coins didn't hurt ethereum's geek-centric user base so badly, simply because ETH was never intended to be money. Eth is just a token fee to power the network, not a way to pay starbucks and your mortgage. It’s certainly not a way to stash your life savings in for long-term storage, and everyone understood that already.
The two coins have very different goals; and bitcoin's goal 100% relies on Public Trust, in exactly the same way the dollar does.
So asking for a hard fork is asking to destroy all that trust and sink bitcoin to sub $1 prices forever simply because bitcoin's got lots of enemies who will buy up hashing power, exchanges, whatever it takes to remove the threat to their existing monopolies. Why risk destroying bitcoin and give them that chance?

"for a money to develop, it must first be a useful commodity in wide circulation" -Is exactly what I'm talking about. It must be useful. As a Commodity. -That's the store of value; commoditization.
You're clearly focusing too much on the 'wide circulation' part, which, by the way, bitcoin already has in spades with over 100 exchanges around the word, and not nearly enough of the importance of it being a GOOD COMMODITY that everyone recognizes.
It's not even a commodity until it's worth roughly the same everywhere first. pork bellies, gold, frozen orange juice, those have universal appeal all over the damn planet and any bitcoiner that thinks bitcoin does already needs to go talk to his grandparents or a liberal for about four seconds.
It takes time to make the commodity, I'm sorry to report... But we're getting there for sure.

I'm not buying it. Bitcoin's a bunch of numbers going back in forth on a decentralized web. If govts &amp; laws worldwide say that all transactions must be done through AML/KYC coinbase/circle-like wallets, that only means that receiving parties (like an exchange or licensed vendor) can only accept coins that are basically whitelisted as coming from one of those wallets.
It doesn't hamper the network at all, we can still use our coins as we see fit around their network and simply choose not to do business with those vendors... Case in point: The bitlicense fallout.

To answer OP's question, bitcoin would be reduced to an offshore bank account for the rich and a few other low-transaction uses. Coffee money functionality will be moved to a new coin or sidechain.

Complacency isn't a good word for it either; There is a hell of a lot of work by a lot of different people to get each tiny bit of development done on such a large and important system. Several different devs run each little suggested snippet of code and test it to see if it helps or hurts and if it isn't a gift from god they'll talk about it in chat channels like IRC endlessly to weed out the harmful &amp; useless stuff. They stay very busy, but because of the economic ramification of changing money, and of course the huge market cap, they don't take any chances.

Volume is being tracked very carefully, we've been watching it from the start.  
The bottom line is that as more people are holding bitcoins, the less volatile the market acts. Real, grassroots growth is helping the volatility decrease every year, usually every month.
We'll pass gold's volatility soon, and that was money for 5000+ years.
It'll take a major mainstream adoption to get the volatility down to where people will feel it's safe enough for use as money... Therefore it can't become money until it's taken off for some other use first.

First of all, using the word "core" is literally a type of attack on Bitcoin. 
In all open source projects like linux distros, when new developers come along and want to change the options/parameters that the original team doesn't like, the new guys fork the code and make up a new brand for their fork. Ubuntu becomes Mint. Bittorrent becomes utorrent, etc.
When big blockers came along, they weren't happy to fork off and create a Bitcoin Cash or other altcoin, they are competing for the brand of bitcoin. This is literally trying to steal Bitcoin away from it's own development team, which is all firmly opposed to large blocks since it is a mathematical dead end. This theft would have been unthinkable if Gavin (big blocker) who was formerly in charge of bitcoin's development didn't decide to name the team "Bitcoin Core" back in the day... People should have fought the idea then but the danger was overlooked.
Secondly, the troglodites in r/btc, and especially Roger Ver, believe that Blockstream's french investment bank investor AXA somehow has control over their actions. This scares the willies out of them because Blockstream employs several top bitcoin developers like Gmax, and sometimes Luke-Jr. 
Nevermind the fact that another company (chaincode labs) employs more BTC developers, and there are more than a dozen companies out there that employ BTC developers, buying these brilliant minds more time to work on coding bitcoin. They're really fixated on Blockstream because blockstream represents to them the opposite of big blocks... Their lightning network and Liquid sidechain projects are layer-two networks that use segwit to take transactions off-chain... And they've been fighting that from happening for years.

Accidents do happen... But when an elected official has to make a choice between holding onto the power he's got or committing his actions to be exposed and transparent, he'd probably quit his job before choosing the first option.
Sure, they'll love a blockchain that makes traffic fines or some other non-power-threatening part of the public-facing government transparent. That makes their job easier and shows the public that they're hip and modern. -But the odds of a blockchain officially tracking any part of the national budget, or having the FBI's surveillance accounted for on it, are about the same as my cat eating the moon today.

Meanwhile, you're being a huge ingrate. Satoshi made a system that worked great but can't scale that easily. You're calling him a liar because the devs in charge of the program today, in his absence, have so far failed to make it keep working the way it did after ten of millions of new users are added?
That's the definition of blaming the wrong source. - And even the devs don't deserve a lot of blame because they've done the work of scaling enough for now, but the users aren't adopting it very quickly!

There are many big companies like IBM very well invested into Ethereum, so I don't think it's going away soon.

No, the downvotes are not salt. The downvotes are from people who realize that Jimmy's credit card advice is great for this time period in which we don't have the rest of bitcoin's infrastructure built out yet. 
Using Visa/MC as a 2nd layer to bitcoin that way is a very useful stopgap method until the day comes in which we have our own 2nd layer and don't even have to convert to fiat anyway because merchants all accept BTC.
No, it doesn't help adoption of bitcoin as a Currency much while we do this, but that is on hold until the 2nd layer is rolled out anyway. Meanwhile, it does nothing to retard bitcoin adoption as a store of value, which is infinitely more important.

Segwit was a necessary upgrade to bitcoin itself (1st layer) that fixed a bug (TxMal), raised the block size a bit, and changed the protocol's formatting enough to make bitcoin hospitable to 2nd layer networks. Lightning was going to be extremely difficult to do on bitcoin without it. 
It actually had many benefits: [

I think about this a lot... And everything in the OP was correct, but didn't take into account Bitcoin's strong Network effects and their effect on Fees.
Who would pay fees in BCH?  How about no one? There's no reason to have fees since blocks are big and most importantly, there are virtually Zero vendors who accept bcash. 
Meanwhile, bitcoin has uses by tens of thousands of people around the world every single day. Those are real fees from real commerce and they can't simply jump over to use BCH like miners do.
So while we will oscillate for a little while, the fact is that on Bitcoin, miners get large fees while on BCH the fees are nominal if existing at all.
Bitcoin is sure to eventually win the mining hashpower war.

Here's the real skinny on OB folks; it basically just came about too early. That's the root of all their problems. They got funded a couple of years ago and built an EXCELLENT platform for spending bitcoins on in a distributed, P2P way that we really all should greatly appreciate.
It absolutely sucks that they did so before the 2017 bubble, when spending BTC became temporarily difficult and very painful for just about every merchant on OB. It turned all of the OB1 devs, save only Brian, against Bitcoin. 
Brian is still demanding lightning network be added asap and never gave up on BTC despite becoming quite the troll on twitter. I think that's just his coping mechanism for being in such a tough position... Most of his customers and all of his employees are on that other btc reddit most days.
But with the LN in place later this year I fully expect OB to become useful to all bitcoiners. By this time next year I bet we'll have an order of magnitude more users on it, too.
But before you think OB could be a cause for moon, remember that Hodlers are not going to spend a lot there before the price is about 100x up from here... That must come first. We still value spending our fiat and stacking our coins too much to make much use of OB in this day and age.
One day, perhaps 5 years from now though, I plan to be doing all my shopping there. Perhaps not my produce, but just about everything that you don't need to buy in person... It'll be far more private, free, fun, and free of fees. 
I sure hope Brian sticks around that long.

We can't know that of course, but we can tell that there is a lot of new, genuine interest around the world. Japan and Russia lately have been doing incredible things. And Segwit activating is giving investors real reason to see major improvements soon.

Three problems I see offhand after skimming...
1. If the denomination on the front is unchangeable, then no one is ever going to reload one because a 1 BTC coin is affordable now but only useful to millionaires in a few years and then billionaires in a few years after that.
2. There is still a learning curve for the mainstream to come to trust it, and it's really not that much faster of a learning curve than bitcoin has... trust is much harder to teach than technical usage, and this has always been a harder learning curve for noobs.
3. A cryptographic processor? Inside a coin? Is this just a mantelpiece or do you want them to circulate, where it'll get squished really quickly?

Bits are just a way of miners and nodes telling us their preference, Bit 1 was the original Segwit plan, but it's threshold was considered too high at the time so Bit 4 is the one specifically signaling intent to go through with SegWit2x. Ironically, it was signaled for at 100%, well past 1's threshold. 
Segregated Witness, the plan to upgrade Bitcoin in a way that will allow for larger blocks and off-chain scaling both, is agreed on by everyone at this point, locked-in last week, and will definitely start showing benefits in about 650 blocks from now, early next week. 
It's just that the only miners agreed to do so if we also make an extremely risky move to hard fork the blockchain and raise the block size 2x more in November. Most Bitcoiners say 'hell no' to that added risk.


A) It's not a 2 MB hard fork, it's a 2 times hard fork... Segwit already makes blocks larger than 2 MB. 
B) It means that sometime in November, 6 months after Segwit locked in, the mining majority will try to upgrade the software they are running to one that doesn't follow the rules that Bitcoin's developers are in control of and we're in for a bumpy ride. Best case scenario is that they back off and become content with Bitcoin Cash... Worst case scenario is that they go ahead and fork off, causing major confusion over bitcoin's brand and reducing it's security. Bitcoin could temporarily go down, even.  But then the community would permanently reject the miners if that happens and after a few hours we'll be back to mining bitcoin with Graphics cards and be better off without mining cartels.  


It's accurate of the mining hash rate, which is an important metric... But not the only metric. Nodes, which basically ARE bitcoin, are diametrically opposed to the fork, well over 95% running the pure bitcoin core client.
The difference is that there are about 9 Chinese miners in control of the hash rate, and 30,000+ individuals in control of the nodes. It's clear what the people want.


Most users side with the developers, and most businesses do too; small to medium sized businesses are all about running core nodes and supporting the core devs; but at least some of the largest businesses got bamboozled and signed up for the New York Agreement backing Segwit2X. They may have even done so not understanding how incredibly insulting and hateful it is to Core developers... I am sure Barry Silbert, the organizer of it, didn't know it insulted them so much at the time, but agreeing to those terms was the only way to get the mining community on board who basically sees the core devs as their roadblock to making larger profits.

Of the two, I prefer my Keepkey, which is sturdy and feels luxurious. The circuit board inside has thicker pathways and was built to survive a beating or the ravages of time. Dropping it is never a concern, and it's got a bigger, prettier screen.

Increasing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE requires a hard fork. 
Hard forks in this contentious atmosphere = Two bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-11-21 10:44:49
The idea of hard-forking bitcoin is as offensive to me as it gets. 
Bitcoin's market share advantage has always been the network effect built on untouchable security. 
Security + Network Effects = Market leader
Tons of better coins have come out since, but the brand of bitcoin has always stayed far ahead because it's trustworthy as anything on earth ever has been and our first-mover advantage has marketed the hell out of that fact for us.
Merchants and business users don't need to know much about bitcoin's workings, they just see the crowd gathered around it, maybe check up to see if it's really as secure as they say, and boom, a service like bitpay takes care of the rest so they can now take bitcoin without hassle.
Forking the blockchain would be MAJOR hassle to people like that. Devastating for trust. 
They'd worry if there are two coins, does their POS machine still work. They'd worry that the two mining groups would fight each other lowering security overall, most importantly, they'd worry if that sign they just put up in the window that says "bitcoin accepted here" is true anymore, or if it's for that other coin.
The trust would be lost, and therefore, so would our first-mover advantage.
**I predict a sub-$10 price, maybe even sub $1 if we hard fork bitcoin.**
Worse yet, those vendors would simply wash their hands of ALL cryptocurrencies, because they're fed up with other people changing the rules on them and having to study like a developer themselves just to keep up.
Kind of reminds me of something a central bank would do to their money, in fact.

If you replaced all of the bank balances and all of the cash with bitcoin, not to mention the gold and other investments or the ginormous derivatives market, bitcoin has a loooooooooooong way to grow in order to fill that void. 
100 years sounds right to me; Although I know it will come in fits and starts. Certainly Satoshi couldn't have known the number of years it would take in advance, but it seemed quite obvious to me back in 2011 that this was what he was planning for, and I certainly wasn't alone back then. All the hardcore early hodlers (before hodling was a word) talked about it and which markets exactly bitcoin would replace daily.

Nations have exactly two tools to fight currency wars with; inflation and interest rates. Every single economist that ever went to school and then got a govt job, worldwide, is a Keynesian economist, who will fight to the death over the fact that to solve X problems, you must inflate the currency, and to fight Y problems, you must move the interest rates.  That's what's drilled into them obsessively in school and they literally sneer and make fun of anyone who thinks something else can move economies or currencies at all in any way possible. 100% of them.
Therefore, imagining anyone in any government embracing bitcoin for such uses is a ludicrous idea. Some would take under-the-table bribes in it, but then walk directly into a staff meeting to deride bitcoins further.

The idea of hard-forking bitcoin is as offensive to me as it gets. Sure, situations like the 2012 emergency hard fork might still arise where 95% of bitcoiners would agree first that it's the best thing for everyone, but other than those extremely few emergencies, it's DAMN OBVIOUS to anyone with a brain that bitcoin's adoption would be set back a whole decade from an ethereum-like hard fork.
Bitcoin's marketshare advantage has always been the network effect built on untouchable security. Tons of better coins have come out since, but the brand of bitcoin has always stayed far ahead because it's trustworthy as anything on earth ever has been and our first-mover advantage has marketed the hell out of that fact for us.
Merchants and business users don't need to know much about bitcoin's workings, they just see the crowd gathered around it, maybe check up to see if it's really as secure as they say, and boom, a service like bitpay takes care of the rest so they can now take bitcoin without hassle.
Forking the blockchain would be MAJOR hassle to people like that. They'd worry if there are two coins, which their POS machine is accepting. They'd worry that the two mining groups would fight each other lowering security overall, most importantly, they'd worry if that sign they just put up in the window that says "bitcoin accepted here" is true anymore, or if it's for that other coin.
The trust would be lost, and therefore so would our first-mover advantage.
I predict a sub $10 price, maybe even sub $1 if we hard fork bitcoin. 
Worse yet, those vendors would simply wash their hands of ALL cryptocurrencies, because they're fed up with other people changing the rules on them and having to study like a developer themselves just to keep up.
Kind of reminds me of something a central bank would do to their money, in fact.
Everyone asking for a hard fork is an enemy of bitcoin.

It's pure FUD that they have been separated in the first place.
What segwit really does is change the order of data per transaction on each line inside of a block. It never left the file. There is no separate file.
Starting in two weeks the witness data, now at the end of the line, can easily be discarded once it is used and it never gets hashed this way, which takes up less system resources and slows down transaction time.  It's simply an efficiency gain, not separation.

They really don't. They won't come out and say it, at least roger won't, but I keep seeing the root of their fear is a conspiracy theory about Blockstream taking over bitcoin for the banks.

**Bitcoin Brokers for the US:**
*  (The IRS sees every transaction, delays getting started.)
*  (Find one of the 512+ BTMs near you)
*  &amp;  (Only deal with very highly-rated sellers)
*  &amp;  (For smaller amounts, usually requires stopping by a bank)
**Real-time exchanges for the US:**
There are many dozens of real-time trading exchanges that allow US customers to trade dollars for bitcoins, located in countries all over the planet. Even some Chinese exchanges do this, it's a really long list. Try BitFinex, Gemini, Bitstamp, BTC-E, or ItBit first for higher volumes and better prices.
**Distributed exchange, use anywhere:**
*  (But very low traffic for now, takes time to get fiat into it.)
There are also Over-the-counter exchanges by the truckload, which generally suffer the same problems as Bitsquare.
For sellers who need some fiat fast, I don't recommend using any of the above; Get yourself a visa/MC debit card from a service like Bitpay, Coinbase Shift, Coinsbank, or Wirex... The delay is MUCH shorter and the fees are better too.
As BitSquare fills up with users, the community will no longer need bitcoin banks like Circle. It's everyone's job here to help it grow, just like we do with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin can do a few smart contracts like multisignature and timelocked sends all by itself.
Technically, bitcoin's already reduced the entire industry of asset management into code, but it's not user friendly yet.
Sooner or later, there is going to be a wallet that has a 'Will' function, that lets you send any amount of btc to any combination of addresses and at the time you specify or upon your death when your Oracle tells it you're dead.
Personal oracles will be along in the next couple years for sure, so just be patient on that front... Until then there are already timelocking-wallets if you can afford to tie up the coins until a set date in the future.

It's a 1MB max now, with about a 2MB average size after segwit.
Here's the thing though; you're fixating on on-chain scaling. No one wants a GB block size because locally your computer would have to do too much work with a GB block; neither side wants that.
What Core team is steering us toward is OFF-chain scaling, so the block size doesn't have to grow any more, maybe not ever, and the transactions are held in other places like on the Lightning network.
Maybe we'll have a 4 MB or even 8MB block one day, but by the time you die the blockchain won't be too big for that 100 TB hard drive, and in 50 years that hard drive might come in a cracker jack box.

Although I agree that Segwit2x should certainly not happen, the Hard Fork that small blockers are scared of certainly did not happen during the Bcash fork.
The difference is control of the brand. Segwit2x would take bitcoin from the core devs and place it in the hands of Garzik and the project located in the /BTC1 folder of github. Most core devs are not able to make changes or have a voice in that directory.
All bcash achieved was to make another altcoin, like litecoin, that happens to include an airdrop to existing bitcoin holders. This was not at all the hard fork that we fear.

You never stated what you believe bitcoin will fail at.
Many people have many different expectations of what they feel bitcoin should be in society. Many people also have no friggin' clue what money actually is.
Your concerns seem like you expect what Roger Ver expects of it; to be a very high transaction-rate walking money, all on-chain.
If you study the code at all, that was NEVER EVER EVER even sorta likely. Not On-chain.
That's why in 2010 Satoshi described the Lightning Network, to help get us from the Safe Store of Value he created to a walking money.
Sadly, Gavin scared him off shortly thereafter by giving the CIA a presentation of the technology.
The fact is we haven't bridged the gap yet getting it there, but after SegWit is activated I think we have a good chance to get there in the next year.

Once a year? They work best when you're in the store, see something that you want, and use your phone to turn that much bitcoin into fiat just minutes before checkout.

Coinbase is far closer to being a bank than being a wallet. Their main sin is holding onto your private keys, so you never really take possession of your btc that they're holding for you until you transfer them away... But not nearly enough people get around to that part so one day when they inevitably get hacked bitcoin's price is going to sink as the media reports again how bitcoin died for good this time.

Correction: Meet Mr. New American guy. (MNAG)
MNAG is a very, very small segment of new bitcoin users, and until bitcoin has already gone mainstream across the third world and is too big to make illegal in the US, MNAG has very few reasons if any to invest in bitcoin. 
MNGs from Venezuela, India, Argentina, the Carribean, Africa, the Phillippines, Indonesia, China, and other top remittance-receiving countries, however, have REAL reasons to need a borderless money that sooner or later they'll have to figure out the hard way.
MNGs from other countries have other reasons that are still better than the reasons MNAGs have. So please tell MNAG to wait his turn; the dollar surely can’t last forever when the rest of the world is trading with bitcoin.

I prefer the censorship here to the type on r/btc anyday.
Here they tell you in advance "don't discuss altcoins, there are too many so we'll delete posts." It's an easy rule to follow.
in r/btc, it's insidious. Every single person who speaks up against Roger and his modsquad's sacred vision gets some kind of stealth rate limiting applied to their accounts, only allowing them to post once every 10 minutes. This makes it hard to respond to any argument before all involved lose interest.
It's an evil, manipulative form of censorship that isn't readily apparent, but pretty much all small blockers get once they show up over there.

Lies. Bigger blocks HAVE been achieved with soft forks via segwit. Here's a testnet 3.7 MB Segwit block that when through a soft fork. It shows the largest possible blocks made under ideal circumstances:
And here's the same testnet 1.7 MB block with 8885 transactions in it. (!) This is a normally-constructed block full of transactions. It shows what normal blocks should look like in a few weeks:
These are bigger blocks. See for yourself. There is no separate block with witness data, it's all just normal, but bigger blocks with the contents re-arranged.
I'm not accusing you of originating these lies, but you can see the two examples above for yourself... It's still 1 block on average every ten minutes on that chain so you're now going to have the unenviable process of reconciling these cold hard facts with the information others like Roger gave you and then realize who has been lying to you to push an agenda afterall.

There are many dozens of real-time trading exchanges that allow US customers to trade dollars for bitcoins, located in countries all over the planet. Even some Chinese exchanges do this, it's a really long list. Try BitFinex, Gemini, Bitstamp, BTC-E, or ItBit first for higher volumes and better prices.

Lol... I don't believe it; there are some of you left.
I thought we'd shown the last of you that FUD is bad and how to avoid it. Guess I was wrong.
I've personally interviewed 3 different Core devs about Segwit when I wrote about it for BraveNewCoin last year. I know more about it than I care to.
The old setting for the block size limit is no longer what restricts the size of blocks. 
Let that sink in. 
The old line of code that says the limit looks like this:
MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000000;
It's still there today, but serves no purpose but to make sure no old clients break reading these nodes.
The new line of code that actually limits block sizes (in one way) is this:
MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE = 4000000;
Go check it; it's there.
It doesn't mean that blocks will reach a whole 4MB though; because there is a second limiter now... A block "Weight" of four million, which is a weighed average of a point scoring system they made up to judge transaction quality.
This weight score will allow it to fill up a block only if all transactions are well made with lots of the right kind of data; it loves P2SH transactions more, for instance.
TONS of testing has been done on testnet and the devs are confident that at today's levels of transactions, Segwit will reach an average of 2.1 MB blocks soon after being adopted.
If we have 2.1 mb blocks, then it is highly illogical to say that the max block size is still just 1 MB. 
Therefore, Segwit raised the block size.

Most oldtimers on here are hodlers, which means we are holding savings in bitcoin at all times. If that sounds too risky to you, start small of course, but look at the charts, they speak for themselves. 2014 was the only year in bitcoin's existence that it didn't grow in price enormously.
I try to only convert out to fiat when forced to, such as paying utility bills and crap like that... When I do, I only use a visa debit card like wirex, bitpay, or Shift. Those let you convert back to fiat without delay and can be spent as fiat anywhere. (Pretty low fees, too.)

**This is the most backwards thing I've ever read on this sub!**
Every last altcoin and every last coinless blockchain on earth from ripple to a bankchain _is_ a payment network without a store of value.
Right now!
If your network is moving empty tokens across it, WHO WILL ACCEPT THOSE TOKENS?  It's very hard to make the tokens valuable, and the blockchain that does so gets the network effect behind it.
In your lifetime, I guarantee you, you'll never see another coin with the network effect behind it other than bitcoin. It requires too much time and public trust.

There's one major difference between hardware wallets of that class (Trezor, KeepKey, Ledger Nano S) and paper wallets or other type of "Cold Storage" that everyone needs to be aware about.
When you store to paper, you're basically making a 'spend-unfriendly but unhackable' stash. It's like taking dollar bills and trading them for a gold bar to stick under your floorboards. Very safe, but you aren't going to be able to spend any portion of it without bringing it all back up and into a wallet.
Those three hardware wallets I mentioned are hackerproof walking wallets. They don't allow private keys onto your computer in any way, so you can consider them safe from hackers... But at the same time you can spend, re-spend, and spend again from them whenever you need to.
Ideally we should all have something like: 
* $100 or less on our mobile phone/laptop wallets that are in a little danger of being hacked but are super accessible. Think: Pocket money.
* Receive our income to our hardware wallets, and hide them at home, using maybe once every bill pay day. - Travelling can be done with one until the TSA figures out what they are. Think: Savings account at the bank.
* A cold storage paper wallet or two in a fireproof safe for long-term security of your nest egg. Think: Safety deposit box or literally burying a gold bar under the floor.
As you receive income on the hardware wallet, you can always route it to the other two as needed or two a bitcoin visa card to use fiat.

For sellers who need some fiat fast, I don't recommend using any of the above; Get yourself a visa/MC debit card from a service like Bitpay, Coinbase Shift, Coinsbank, or Wirex... The delay is MUCH shorter and the fees are better too.
As BitSquare fills up with users, the community will no longer need bitcoin banks like Circle. It's everyone's job here to help it grow, just like we do with Bitcoin.

For long term storage using paper wallets is great, but chance of fire is a real thing, so the only way I'd ever use a paper wallet is to store it in a fireproof safe.
For "long-ish" term storage, Hardware wallets like Trezor, Keepkey, and the Ledger Nano S are great solutions because they stop hackers from having any access to your coins, allowing you to spend them a bit when you need to. -A combination of both is best.  Always get paid into your paper or hardware wallet, and then sort out what you need that day or week over to your ‘walking’ wallet on your mobile phone. (Mycelium, Airbitz, copay, etc.)

You think no one's ever tried? Heck, for that matter, I even tried it myself, back in 2011... It's easy as pie to fork it with the mining power of just one person or even one mining farm... But no one ever hears about it when you do and nothing looks different on the network.
Getting a large % of the hashing power to branch off, that's what I mean by hard forking bitcoin... Anything less is too insignificant to talk about.
Even then, say, above 10%, it's hard as hell to hold onto until you're truly in the majority. Miners who make their living mining core won't sit by and let you win; I assume they'll use anything and everything in their power to DESTROY such an attack; it's their entire livelihood.

Related, but not exactly.
Govts are always going to pull crap like that whenever they can get away with it. The problem in India is that when they pull crap like that and the people are severely inconvenienced, they still cheer on the government and parrot their talking points.
The international news has been full of interviews of people in India lately standing in long lines talking about how much time and money this surprise has cost them. Some people have even died over it, and every woman in India that had a secret stash that didn't want her abusive or foolish husband to know about it was forced to come clean, and lose their husbands trust or get an asswhooping. This was apparently a very common thing there.
...But every single person interviewed, without fail, said "But since we fought corruption I guess it's worth it."

It's the "today" part of that sentence that is misleading. 
Satoshi designed a system that was woefully inadequate for mainstream adoption and said so.
The method of scaling that won out in the greater bitcoin dev community was to scale off-chain, with layers like LN, and they knew as early as 2014 that this would be taking the word "today" and putting it on a shelf for as many years as it would take to properly deploy said layers.
All other courses of action is to risk what BCH is doing to merchants now, which is making them adopt something that won't exist in a few years and have them burn out on the whole concept of crypto.

I can't imagine why someone would say it doesn't work for bitcoin, unless they're focused on max gains and not safety. Of course you can still buy the dips while doing so, and I'd think those are easier to spot in bitcoin than anywhere else because we have such steady volatility.
@_date: 2017-01-21 06:04:35
This is where I take the exception though. You're right that they don't want it... But don't you think the reason that they don't want it might have something to do with the fact that they are wrong or have been misled?

Which conflicts with many phrases like "We put a spider in a card" and the first FAQ answer that says clearly that they're "serious about this."
If they're going to put a dollar store fake rubber spider or a picture of a spider in there instead it just won't have any of the intended affect on the recipient.
Therefore they are NOT serious about this, unless it's a real arachnid.
So either they tell us more about the spider and how it survives transit, or they should tell us what is being sent instead so we can see how hokey and stupid their biz model is.

The thing is, despite all the fud slinging around the block size debate, bitcoin is FAR more stable today than it was 5 years ago. The Network effects makes things Stronger over time, not weaker.
Suggesting that bitcoin will die in the next 14 years is tantamount to saying that despite rising prices and rewards and incentives to protect bitcoin, somehow the majority of the devs and miners are going to choose to harm it and destroy bitcoin, throwing all of their wealth away.

Hardware wallets have one purpose: To make your wallet safe from hackers. If you sweep your paper into a software wallet and don't have a hardware wallet, then "an electronic hack somewhere along the line" can exist and steal your funds then.

I'm very happy about the initiative taken here and even ecstatic to hear that you've pulled together $1m for advertising fees. 
I am, however, PISSED that these three bland, factless spots are the best you've come up with. Hell, a simple search on Youtube for the word "bitcoin" returns a hundred or more far more interesting videos to pull source material from.
The thing that makes these ad spots completely, utterly ineffective is that they shy away from the facts. Accepted on Mars?? I GUARANTEE that this spot will be a blight on bitcoin's reputation, not help it in any way.
The kid running was in poor taste, and any parent (target demo) watching it will immediately think "WTF? Why are those druggies pushing their anonymous currency used on the Silk Road at my toddler??! I'm calling the cops!"
The third one was only slightly cringeworthy, but not offensive. Still, it was completely ineffective because it didn't impart any facts or impressive features of the borderless internet money that does what nothing else on earth has ever accomplished. The user learns Zilch.
I understand that stock footage was used to lower costs. This is just one of those cases where stock footage isn't going to cut it... Either show video taken from mining farms and graphs and such, perhaps a CGI representation of the network... Or keep it super simple and impress them only with facts.

Scarcity sits right at the top of that list, and now that the world is getting it's first taste of cloud money, I expect the top (or at least a close 2nd) criterion to become portability soon as bitcoin rises. (It was already in the top 5)

Invalid example is invalid. GSM, NMT, and AMPS aren't something that users have to choose to change and come to consensus on... They're just buying new phones while the phonemakers came to a consensus without asking anyone.
With bitcoin, Every single person who accepts the currency does so believing that they're switching this one time to the future currency and don't want to switch again, especially with the cost of upgrading point of sale equipment or training employees how to use it.
This is exactly why superior altcoins won't ever catch up to bitcoin. It's way too much of a bother to get all the vendors to upgrade... And if you take the choice away from them they'll just feel like all their work to move to bitcoin was wasted and fall back to fiat currencies at light speed.

How sad. I guess when people only pay attention to the price and don't listen to any of the good channels like cryptotwitter or the devlist they just don't see all the awesome stuff going on... There's more innovation in the bitcoin space than I'm sure I can convince you of.
Bitcoin is not unusable, and hasn't been since the end of last year. We still have a lot of merchant adoption to do, but it's been sending all kinds of money around for sub-penny fees most every day this year. Lightning will bridge the rest of that gap, especially with the confirmation time problem. 
Those payment methods you mentioned visa can use now are simple tricks that bitcoin wallets have demonstrated before as well. If you want to see what REAL innovation looks like, check out some of the projects that are going on with lightning and bitcoin's privacy upgrades. My personal favorite: Samourai Wallet's joint venture with GoTenna and their P2P ad-hoc networking tech.

Bottom line on manipulation is this: They can't make any more of them, and they can't take em from hodlers... Therefore all manipulation is a short term play, period.
* The only variables that matter are supply and demand. All the rest of the stuff you're worried about is just unfounded fear or fud. Meanwhile, how can any crypto or DLT surpass bitcoin when bitcoin has all the best devs in the world and the strongest incentive around to keep them coming?

Well, if you're only talking about a long-term solution that you don't see yourself touching for years, then sure, use a good BIP38 paper wallet setup, because the inconvenience of removing coin from paper won't affect you much at all.  What you will likely find ideal for those is at least two good fireproof safes, stored at separate sites. DO NOT stick one in a safety deposit box; banks often look into those and even make you declare the contents... And they're not to fond of bitcoins.
Hardware wallets are freaking awesome if you're actually using any bitcoins, however. Think of them as ways to keep malware and hackers away from coins that you need to use. I don't worry about losing coins during surge/flare/EMPs at all with one; you've got to back them up with a long seed phrase that can be restored elsewhere.
I don't think aluminum in a fireproof safe is that much more likely to survive a fire than paper is if the fire is hot enough to compromise the steel safe in the first place. If it's a bunch of money you're talking about, then your safety must be in numbers, or very expensive high-temp metals that must be carved in a lab setting, which would be very dumb if not for the BIP38 encryption.
Good luck!

It objectively is superior, but people aren't smart enough to understand how. In every single criteria that is used to judge money, bitcoin either is far superior now, or has a technical limitation (TPS, Liquidty) that can can be overcome in time with a talented dev team. (which we have.)
Unfortunately, we also have a populace that thinks money is nothing but whatever their govt says it is, so they just don't get it until an event happens to them personally like Venezuela or India that makes them see the advantages.

Double check in your records that this is indeed the place you mean to send it to. It couldn't have been an address that was entered wrong, however, because somebody owned it and spent it within an hour.
Nothing looks fishy about this except the 6 minute wait between receiving and spending. And maybe the fact that those who received it spent it within the hour... But their step looks less fishy than yours.

You can't generate wealth without creating something. That's a law of nature, there is no way around it no matter how many socialists whine about it.
Ironically, bitcoin will stop the only loophole to this rule: deficit spending allowed govts to make it look like you could generate wealth without creation... They're just robbing the unborn and paying the living like some giant ponzi scheme so it kinda works for the short term and makes a lot of socialists happy....

97% is in China because China's got the right mix of:
1) High population (1.4 Billion ppl there)

3) Zero-fee exchanges
The entire country has 3 BTM machines (4 more each in Macau and HK naturally) versus 512 in the USA... Its adoption has taken a very different path there and seems to be the favorite hedge for gamblers in that culture, but banks aren't allowed to touch it so there's very little chance of it catching mainstream usage adoption as a currency.

Adding a password to a well encrypted BIP38 wallet is great, but not simple enough for most. They'll think of the physical security on their safe as the only security they need, and remembering the password is useless to them because they'd simply want to write it down and keep it.... In the one fireproof safe that they own.
I submit that something really clever needs to be done to keep a BIP38 encrypted PW nearby your paper wallet, so anyone in that safe can't simply grab them both... Like disguising the password as something totally unrelated to bitcoin.
Either way, it's enough scariness to put many users off btc altogether... Let's get them UP to the level of security of a good seed phrase in their safe first, ok? At least that truly is simple and in most cases just as effective.

India is a cash-only economy, basically. So much of the money doesn't come back into the banks, they don't have a decent accounting of it anymore and suspect that the vast majority of all of the two largest bills are all in savings under some gangster's mattress. 
They call this 'black money,' which is perfectly legal by itself but inconvenient for the banks. - So naturally the PM and whole government has been on a crusade to rid the country of black money and force it all back into the banking system.  
A one-time trade out of the two largest bills will accomplish this for now, but it's not a final solution.
Next year they want to introduce digital fiat currency and make black money completely impossible... At a time when only 10% or less of the country is even eligible for a bank account!  Yeah, right.

Alright. My main issue with your argument was the part where you said that "anything that can happen will eventually happen so we better get ready for it." This flies in the face of self-interested investors. Both HODLing (Gresham's law) and Network effects would need to be 'defeated' for a serious HF to occur. 
...And not just by one self-interested party... There are many who are out to protect their livelihood from miners (with the tools to effect change) to the investors to the exchange and wallet operators... All have ways of fighting the hard fork and are precisely as motivated to do so as they are invested in bitcoin. ($12 billion worth, cumulatively.)
I can sympathize with the argument that people in the r/btc crowd and other HF advocates will interpret their self interest to make them work in the opposite direction, but there is a hole in that argument that their funds are not in immediate existential jeopardy now. If they take no action, they are not going to immediately lose funds. If they do take action, then there is a real risk that all confidence will be gone throughout the cryptocurrency landscape overnight and they won't have any value left in their investment tomorrow.
It comes down to the point at which anyone will take action. The decision they make in the very minute it's time to act. There is an economic term for that mindset which I forget now but the point is that we humans can advocate for dangerous things on a daily basis, including a political candidate or a choice in currency, and then when it's time to pull the trigger we still act in self-interest alone.  
You just have to ask yourself, those with the mining power and other resources that make a difference... The highly invested.... Are they really going to see a radical change at the last second as something they'll carry through with, or will they protect their wealth and take the safer option?
@_date: 2016-11-28 11:12:24
Yes, lots of us use them, mainly because it's the cheap way or the Fast way to go from BTC to fiat. Coinbase isn't very loved around here but their shift card is ok. (For US users.) The Bitpay card is better. Outside of the US there are lots of good cards like Wirex and Bitwala, and Xapo's good but it carries a bitcoin balance so isn't for everyone.  (Because bitcoin balances aren't as safe in a card as they are in a good wallet.)
There's a lot to read before you figure out which is right for your needs.

**Bitcoin Brokers for the US:**
*  (The IRS sees every transaction, delays getting started.)
*  (Find one of the 512+ BTMs near you)
*  &amp;  (Only deal with very highly-rated sellers)
*  &amp;  (For smaller amounts, usually requires stopping by a bank)
**Real-time exchanges for the US:**
There are many dozens of real-time trading exchanges that allow US customers to trade dollars for bitcoins, located in countries all over the planet. Even some Chinese exchanges do this, it's a really long list. Try BitFinex, Gemini, Bitstamp, BTC-E, or ItBit first for higher volumes and better prices.
**Distributed exchange, use anywhere:**
*  (But very low traffic for now, takes time to get fiat into it.)
There are also Over-the-counter exchanges by the truckload, which generally suffer the same problems as Bitsquare.
For sellers who need some fiat fast, I don't recommend using any of the above; Get yourself a visa/MC debit card from a service like Bitpay, Coinbase Shift, Coinsbank, or Wirex... The delay is MUCH shorter and the fees are better too.
As BitSquare fills up with users, the community will no longer need bitcoin banks like Circle. It's everyone's job here to help it grow, just like we do with Bitcoin.

If Winklevii ETF starts trading, double all of these numbers.
Then it'll come down a few K, maybe back to $2k for a while, because that's just what adoption looks like.
But by then things will be getting really exciting. Bitcoin's effects, not blockchain's, will be in the news daily as this country fights it and that country embraces it and thefts will be more incredible and fortunes made will start to appear on the Forbes billionaire list, finally.
By 2020 I expect no less than a $10k bitcoin, and maybe even $35k.  The developing world will ALL have smartphones by then. Every human will be connected online, and only one money will exist between them all.

@_date: 2018-06-26 22:13:43
When people talk about the witness data being removed, they assume all kinds of wild, incorrect things like second blocks or alternative blocks being deployed to hold them... This simply is not the case.
Witness data was moved TO THE END OF EACH LINE inside of a block. It went from this:
TX data -witness data- other stuff
to this:
TX data - other stuff - witness data
Doing it this way has allowed the parsing function of our nodes to totally ignore the last part of each line if they don't want to upgrade to segwit. When you had the big block of witness data in the middle of each line, the parser had no choice but to parse it all, which takes time and computer resources, and therefore it makes it harder on nodes to run bigger blocks in that format.
Post Segwit, they can safely ignore that data, per line, as it's mostly just used by miners anyway. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 09:41:28
Why? It's just math.
I'm only assuming two things to come to that conclusion:
1. Bitcoin doesn't stall out and die, which is logical considering how  incentivized the whole community is to keep it growing and protect it.
2. As it grows, it becomes more useful because it finds more stability and more uses.
Given those two things, I honestly can't think of a reason why in time it can't overcome any roadblocks to becoming the world's biggest currency (since it operates everywhere without permission) and the biggest store of value. (Because it's like gold in the cloud, so it's far more convenient, secure, and useful.) 
I just don't know the date it'll get that big... But it will. Governments keep ruining their own currencies so if for no other reason than inflation/hyperinflation over time the whole world will be holding some bitcoin at some point.

The economy you are worried about not working with bitcoin is a horrible, terrible trap that keeps poor people poor and steals from everyone constantly through inflation. It's one of the worst things that has ever happened to mankind.
You know how an honest, debt-free country would work every time you balance your checkbook. Infrastructure spending must be raised first or it doesn't get spent. Entitlements get replaced by Charity, which mankind is far more happy to pay when half of our wealth isn't being sucked out of our paychecks in taxes already.
Universal income can never work, not without murdering the deadbeats, Stalin.
Pensions will be replaced by just holding bitcoin, which constantly rises in value the more the coins used, needed, and lost over time. 
There is a lot of reading to do on this subject in Austrian economics. Ron Paul loved talking about it, there must be a million books on Mises.org that cover this stuff.

Number 1 doesn't stop many of bitcoin's use cases... It will only serve to move wealth out of those illegal countries into the developing countries where it is adopted faster than ever before.
Number 2 ignores the network effect, and is about as likely to happen as a cat eating the moon.
Number 3 will certainly happen in many countries... But it can't be "as good as bitcoin" because they need it to be inflationary. Also, the trust part isn't necessary because only a small fraction of privacy-minded people are aware that govt's aren't trustworthy.
This govt coin will serve to help bitcoin, however, not hinder it. When govts make a cryptocurrency, that coin can be exchanged for bitcoin. Theirs will be flawed in that it is inflationary and only spendable in their country, while bitcoin is both global and deflationary, making it a far superior currency that every last 3rd-world farmer would rather hold onto than their national cryptofiat.
Since it's easily convertible, those people will save in bitcoin and spend their fiat, making those cryptofiats hyperinflate due to no demand for them. It'll be beautiful.

As for the "imminent threat" of hard forks, I'm not worried, the Core team knows how to fight this better than we do. Just the 2-week difficulty adjustment period alone makes it extremely hard for a bitcoin alt fork to become profitable enough for miners to move to it.
...And any that doesn't get a LOT of hashing power moving to it quickly, say, 35% or more, is going to have an extremely hard time surviving attacks by existing miners who don't want any forks destroying their income stream.

Scaling the planet's money tech is hard.

The moment people decide to use something as a store of value, that's when it's scarcity matters.
Pizza day was the day that started with bitcoin. More and more people have, individually, one at a time, each decided it is a good store of value for them too, and at that time, per person, did scarcity matter to them enough that they chose it over some competitor like gold.

Greed keeps whales -&gt;that don't have bitcoin yet&lt;- from pumping and dumping.
It's a really simple formula... It only seems difficult because we mere mortals are used to thinking of money as having an infinite supply... Bitcoin has a limited supply, the first money ever to do so.
1) Greedy people (looking out for self interest) already have most of the bitcoin. (The bitcoin rich whales)
2) When fiat-rich people, banks, and governments want to pump bitcoin's market, they have to buy bitcoin.
3) That makes the price go up, and even if spending a only one million dollars, it can make the price go up a lot.
4) If they tried to make the price tank at this time, when they've only bought 2,000 of the 17 Million bitcoins outstanding, then they haven't accomplished anything. The price would drop from the $1,500 or so that they pumped it to down to only $1000, but then the existing bitcoin-rich whales will have so much wealth on their hands that it's easy to buy some more and bring the price back somewhat.  Greed protects us other bitcoin holders there, at least in the long run.
5) If instead, the fiat-rich bastards want to own a million bitcoins so they can do some REAL damage dumping it; then what will happen is that it'll take years to accumulate all of that bitcoin due to the limited supply, and the daily upward price slippage will make the price of a bitcoin so high that they'll never be able to afford that one millionth coin... EVERYONE holding a bitcoin will be a millionaire by then. You, me, all of us... And the existing financial system will suffer horribly with all that wealth moved into bitcoin. Economies will spiral downwards, people will jump ship into bitcoin faster than ever, and they'll basically have planted the seeds which insures that bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency.
6) But let's say they survived that too... Somehow, through enough under-the-table backroom deals they managed to acquire 1 million coins without destroying their own fiat currency... We'll all be a lot richer still, because they sunk billions into our pockets buying those coins, which are now maybe with $100k bitcoins, say.  If that day somehow arrives, never forget, their 1 million bitcoins is still only 1/17th of all bitcoins outstanding,  and they'll have made the entire world watch the power of bitcoin skyrocket for years... Millions, heck, maybe BILLIONS of people will be using it then.  The price won't tank completely if 1 million are sold that day... WAY too many new buyers will be happy to buy them up at a 2% discount by then.
So when all is said and done, I'm salivating at the thought of a giant pump and dump being attempted on bitcoin. They'll only manage to pump it up a lot, not so much the dump part.

I think you would greatly benefit from Reading Saifedean Ammous' The Bitcoin Standard. He's a professor &amp; economist and gives the most thourough explanation anywhere of why bitcoin is the world's best money and then some.
Of course a few features are still ironing out the wrinkles... I can't imagine gold was simultaneously accepted everywhere within the first decade of its use as money. Bitcoin might beat that acceptance rate by millenia due to it's many features and the portability boost.

I'm defensive about it because voting is inflicting your will upon other people and frankly makes you a mean person. We anarchists have learned to see through the excuse of "But everyone else is doing it!" 
Keep in mind, anarchy only means without rulers, not with rules. It's the only moral way of living life possible, in fact.
**Things people naturally do without government interference:**
* Be friendly, funny, sweet, and charming.
* Give good advice or a helping hand.
* Use good table manners.
* Show charity to their fellow man.
* Hold the door open for the person behind you.
* Assist others in a vast number of emergency situations.
* Sacrifice much to raise their children with love and plenty.
* Be kind to animals, even take care of them.
* Form lines.
* Cooperate to build a community project together.
* Do missionary and other charity work.
* Generally make others happy and be a happy person yourself.
**Some things people only do because the government requires them to:**
* Steal money from other people. (Taxes)
* Inflict your will on other people. (Voting)
* Enforce a long list of rules with deadly violence if resisted. (Cops)
* Kill other people. (Soldiers, cops)
* Kill LOTS of other people. (Wars, genocide)
But government-run schools clearly tell us that without the government, we'd have Chaos.
Perhaps they weren't telling the truth about that, being such assholes and all?

The entirety of southeast asia, which includes the triangle with the majority of humanity in it, gets facebook messenger to their mobile phones for free.
The kicker: Even when they don't pay their data plan!
That's right, FB is giving everyone free data in the most dense area of humanity just to use their messenger, which is already the defacto way for most people to communicate and do business like buy deals and promos at their local grocery stores down there.
This *might* be a threat to bitcoin. :(

There's also no reason to believe that many people have sold yet, either. Many wallets haven't come up with a way yet (or refuse to) give their customers access to BCH in order for them to send it anywhere. Most just couldn't be bothered to take the time to learn how to deal with it all.
Of the 16m BCH that came into existence last week, less than 1/4th has even been moved at all, so 3/4 of them certainly have not been sent to an exchange for sale at the very least. This will likely result in constant downtrending as more and more finally get around to accessing them over time.

It gives me a bit of comfort though, knowing how so much of the population still hasn't bought any bitcoin. They'll all be forced to one day, so the more that are idiots about it now means the higher the price will go before then.

Your lack of perception of how much the devs are doing in bitcoin is absolutely typical. I've seen it 100 times before, and most of those people split off and followed roger over to that crapcoin's camp. 
Here's a little secret: The devs DO NOT WANT to be known and seen and fussed over. They like coding in secret and sometimes even add code pseudonymously. We have a meritocratic organization in Bitcoin that gets results without putting reputations at risk, but more importantly, keeps the process decentralized so no govt could simply abduct a few key devs and steal bitcoin from us.
Rest assured that the devs of Bitcoin Core are as active as ever and working on adding Privacy layers to bitcoin right now. They take a long time to get new additions into it, not because they are understaffed in any way, but because they test and test and re-test each others work like crazy, which is exactly what you should hope for in a live, working financial app that holds hundreds of billions of dollars worth of value.

**Bitcoin Brokers for the US:**
*  (The IRS sees every transaction, delays getting started.)
*  (Find one of the 512+ BTMs near you)
*  &amp;  (Only deal with very highly-rated sellers)
*  &amp;  (For smaller amounts, usually requires stopping by a bank)
**Real-time exchanges for the US:**
There are many dozens of real-time trading exchanges that allow US customers to trade dollars for bitcoins, located in countries all over the planet. Even some Chinese exchanges do this, it's a really long list. Try BitFinex, Gemini, Bitstamp, BTC-E, or ItBit first for higher volumes and better prices.
**Distributed exchange, use anywhere:**
*  (But very low traffic for now, takes time to get fiat into it.)
There are also Over-the-counter exchanges by the truckload, which generally suffer the same problems as Bitsquare.
For sellers who need some fiat fast, I don't recommend using any of the above; Get yourself a visa/MC debit card from a service like Bitpay, Coinbase Shift, Coinsbank, or Wirex... The delay is MUCH shorter and the fees are better too.
As BitSquare fills up with users, the community will no longer need bitcoin banks like Circle. It's everyone's job here to help it grow, just like we do with Bitcoin.

2. Visa has innovations at all? Please enlighten us. 100x Bitcoin's innovations would be quite a historical level of innovation, like, say, building the pyramids or at least the ISS. 
3. Shorters are helping move BTC from weak hands to strong hands, and constantly have to fight the generally bullish mentality around bitcoin. They concentrate it in the hands of us hodlers. Does this sound like a pattern that will last forever?

Nothing is said about lightning scaling, which is a topic nearly no one understands. Here is how it was explained to me by Luke-jr and Peter Todd:
Luke-jr: "Lightning essentially eliminates any TPS limit, and instead replaces it with a user limit; there are
various estimates on how many users it will support with what block sizes, but I think we'll need to wait and see how it works out in practice to have a reliable figure." 
Peter Todd: "The sky is the limit with Lightning. I mean, this is the thing with scaling: when you have truly scalable
technology, there is no limit to how many transactions per second you can do. It's like asking "With Windows 10, how many webpages documents can the whole world visit per second?" The web is a scalable system, so there isn't any specific upper limit."
Bonus related question:
Q: Are you worried that one lightning network could become really popular and 're-centralize' bitcoin to some extent?
Luke-jr: "No, since Lightning is a decentralised system. If anything, it will improve on Bitcoin's current decentralisation by reducing the cost to run a full node."

The funny thing is, if you have to use it on something, Spending fiat is the opposite of Hodling fiat, so it's perfectly in line with our needs to spend it... Just don't save it.
The reason I bring this up on a btc debit card thread is because there is no better way for us to turn coin into fiat. (Assuming you don't earn any fiat anymore and therefore don't have any to spend when you need it.) Using one of these cards like Bitpay that doesn't make you wait more than a few minutes to go from btc to fiat is *the* fast &amp; cheap way of going from BTC to USD for those few times when you have to spend USD.
One day I won't need one anymore, but until my rent, utils, gas and groceries can be bought with bitcoin directly I literally cannot handle the fees of doing it any other way.
So you're really shooting yourself in the foot with this line of reasoning.

No, he correctly theorizes that bitcoin is the best form of money that mankind has ever invented... By leaps and bounds, and the way money works is that all value moves from bad money to good money.
It always has. So basically, with bitcoin set-in-stone supply, by suggesting that the price of bitcoin will never reach its previous ATH again sounds as ludicrious as me saying I only walked as far as my neighbors house, therefore humans aren't capable of walking across entire cities or states.

Just to stir up the pot; consider how much more wealth the other two thirds of the planet can create once they've finally joined the online communities and can use a major global currency for a change.

Even if "both sides win" as you say, from a peaceful split, the fact is that both mining groups are the perfect weapon to use against the other mining group, and therefore anyone, anywhere, including all governments and rich assholes that dislike either coin, now have to do only half as much work to defeat or corner the market of the coin of their choice... And the perfect weapon will by lying around waiting for them to use.
The crappy altcoins you mentioned aren't worth the bother. Bitcoin's market cap is so much larger than theirs that it's the only game in town for anyone with the power to attack in this way. The other SHA-256 coins? Big bitcoin miners simply find it more profitable to keep mining bitcoin than game those tiny shitcoins.
You're basically suggesting the equivalent of using two different security companies to guard a single building. One company is MUCH stronger than two separate companies in that situation, because each company can be used to attack the other company at any time, from the inside, and heck, even blame the other company for the 'breach.'
So it's not about "in the beginning," it's about "Every second they exist they are at high alert for a hostile takeover."
Also, you don't give nearly enough credit to Network Effects.  -That ain't just a clever band name.
The way you dismissed my arguments about confidence is frightening. This is STRICTLY a confidence issue and your response indicates that you either don't understand how confidence fits into bitcoin's value, or you don't even understand how confidence is important to any money's value. Are you even aware that your own fiat money you have in your pocket is worth absolutely nothing? Only your confidence in the fact that someone will trade something for it later makes it valuable to YOU.  
Bitcoin is no different, but exists in an even more fragile state with more ways for people to lose confidence in it. With Fiat money, confidence is lost in just one way; the govt won't be able to pay it's debts, basically.  With Bitcoin, there are several, if not dozens, of different confidence hurdles for us to jump over to make the mainstream want to use it too, and in this thread you basically tried to throw away a couple of our biggest confidence boosters.

The problem with your statement is that you assumed the wrong motives from the start, which led you to believe that the first scenario (the IRS taxing 3500 events per person) was impossible.
It is not.
The IRS is an office of the US Treasury department.
The very dept that is in charge of the US Dollar.
They aren't exactly in love with competition to their product over there. Nor do they like tools that can be used to evade the IRS's collection efforts.
They WILL demand that everyone turn in their 3500 taxable events, and this will be used to discourage bitcoin use by US citizens.
Most won't bother to keep logs of their usage, and the IRS will respond by overcollecting and issuing penalties.
Yes, on a really grand scale. -But it will work at discouraging bitcoin spending, and therefore be useful to the IRS and Treasury dept.

Normally I'd agree. But with the unit of value that my livelihood is stored on, I still want to punch you in the jimmy for even suggesting bitcoin could be forked.
It's about confidence in the network, both in terms of mining security and in terms of vendor acceptance.
If BitcoinA had 1 Exahash and BitcoinB had 1 Exahash, wouldn't the two bitcoins each be less secure than our present 2 exahash bitcoin network?  Hell, one's miners could destroy the other coin completely.
Bitcoin-accepting vendors would be screwed... Which bitcoin does that sign in their window refer to now, and what happened to their funds?  They'd dump all their bitcoins overnight simply because it's too difficult to keep up with the tech, and lose confidence in cryptocurrency altogether.
But more importantly, right now we can tell the uninitiated that our network is the strongest in the world and can't be hacked because nothing else comes close to  our 2 exahash security solution. It's true now, and it'll be a lie after a fork.
I've been a bullish hodler since 2010, and I think I'd settle for a PoS altcoin to hold my value if bitcoin were to split.

You're missing how hard it is for those whales you're imagining to acquire the bitcoin in the first place.
Do you imagine that Satoshi or any of the first 100 early adopters were double agents all along and will be the ones cashing out? That's fruity if so.
Do you imagine that as giant banks and corps start buying bitcoin up to become those whales, prices will somehow just stay down in the basement, allowing them to scoop up as much as the first 100 adopters have?
That would make you mathematically challenged.
They bottom line is that the 'bad acting whales' will never be able to get their hands on as much coin as the 'good acting whales' have, and therefore their tank attempts can easily be countered by the community who cares about their nest eggs.

If nothing were to change, I'd say this is spot on. 
But something MAJOR is changing... The Lightning Network.
It isn't just going to make a few payments faster... It's actually going to deliver the promise satoshi made in the first place but was never before delivered... 
Bitcoin has scared off tons and tons of adoption because it 'didn't work as promised' or had poor UX.  This year that changes for good.
I expect by the end of the year tons of great wallets, stores, and Lapps will be using Lightning and it will be awesome. Christmas shopping season will really show the world some envious numbers proving bitcoin is close to being ready for the big leagues.
So I'd place the start of the next parabolic near or around the end of the year. Maybe a slow slant upwards through the holidays and then sometime early next year the real fireworks begin.

No, third parties are where you go wrong.
Buy it on coinbase if you must, but it's better to buy it somewhere like localbitcoins where there isn't as much recordkeeping. 
No matter where you buy it, send it to a wallet that you OWN THE PRIVATE KEY TO, such as one loaded on your computer just to receive these bitcoins.
Now you have two choices for long term storage really; either you can make a paper wallet or you can buy a hardware wallet. Both have very high security, but you have to learn about how to use them properly first.
If you refuse to spend the time to learn a lot first, go with a hardware wallet like a KeepKey, Trezor, or Ledger Nano S... These all cost under $100 and will guard your coins from hacks very very well... Buy them first before buying your bitcoins.
If you take the time to learn about doing it right, using the paperwallet is actually better advice in your situation.

The base size is the the smallest blocks will be, the serialized size is the largest. 
Base is what it will be when all the transactions in a block are already stripped of their witness data, i.e. perfectly empty. 
Serialized is what it will be when all the transactions are Fat with witness data, i.e. perfectly full.
What segwit is, at it's core, is a new way to structure that very data so blocks are filled more efficiently. The "base" and "Serialized" didn't exist a version ago; it was all just a max block size then.
Now the defining number that says how big blocks will be is the new block weight size, set to four million 'weight.' It's not measured in megabytes, it's a number of weighed transactions in a file meant to help align them more efficiently.
So to answer your question, I used serialized because that's the new "max" block size, after explaining twice above that the real block size will be around 2.1 Megabytes in practice.

Forgive all the pessimism; because of the block size debate we have a bunch of "concern trolls" wandering in here and making up stories not too different from your own to point out how bitcoin's not working and then demand we fix bitcoin's scaling in the way that they want them fixed. It's really aggravating. 
Your wallet has a bitcoin public address that the coins were sent to from wall of coins. It probably starts with a 1 and looks something like this:  15btWize9h75jtA3fpc7Cfvd9THHyuSvGk
If you tell us your public key (Keep your longer private key hidden if you know it!) we can see the transaction on the blockchain.
It's even easier on us if you go to a block explorer like blockchain.info, (there are many others) place your public key in the search box below, and find the transaction where you sent the coins out... A longer transaction ID number will be the thing that identifies the very transaction that went sour to everyone.
Basically, there are 4 possibilities.
1. Wall of coins never sent them to you in the first place, so you never actually received them in your wallet... But that should be obvious in your wallet.
2. You're clueless about how your wallet works and they're still in there but you aren't looking correctly. Which wallet do you use?
3. You sent it correctly, and just don't know how to see it.
4. You sent it to the wrong address and are completely screwed.
We can only tell which by looking at the transaction. Find the # yet? Posting public keys and transaction IDs is perfectly safe but may tie your reddit username to that address in the future, so you'll want to stop using it as soon as you can.
p.s. If you're a concern troll, one of the many hackers around here is going to give you a 'present.' ;)

A bitcoin is a unit of wealth storage. That's an extremely useful feature where they are right now.
Paypal would send them (if it still goes there) their local currency, which is very, very bad at storage. 
They'd simply need to hold bitcoins and only cash out to their local bitcoin exchange (Yes they have one) for local fiat when they need that fiat.
Plenty already do this in all currencies around the earth; it'll work much better in places where hyperinflation runs rampant.

You're not thinking this through very well... There were lots of assumptions in that rebuttle, so I needed time to take them one by one, Here's some of the obvious stuff you overlooked:
* "The money that is made through theft is from robbing Banks (yes, this is still very, very common) and merchants"
\-Both of which will be based on bitcoin wallets in the future. That's a big part of my point. When gangs and mafias no longer rob banks because there are no longer any banks with large bunches of physical money to run out with, then their tactics necessarily have to change to target bitcoin hodlers. WE'LL be their alternative to the physical piles of money in a store or bank vault.
* " you're way more likely to be robbed by a friend, roommate or family member. "
That was a 'feature' of physical cash. It won't even exist anymore with a cryptocurrency-only money supply because security on smartphones is already pretty decent and the transparency of the act left on the blockchain is quite a powerful deterrent.
* " even if you knew my home address and the fact that I said I have 1 bitcoin "
My point was much more directed at the bigger hodlers, say, in the 21 club and up. Maybe one day 1 btc will be enough though.
* " just an internet troll... don't have my Bitcoin address... don't have any clue if I even keep it in my house"
When someone on the internet says, on any date at all, that they have a portable asset worth tens of millions of dollars, it is only foolhardy to expect that no one with the tools and inclination to steal that will go through great lengths to steal it once it has achieved that price. I certainly expect them to do their due diligence, but if you actually do have a lot of coins and meanwhile have imperfect OpSec, you will look like a bank vault full of gold with no guards on duty to the entire criminal underworld.
The nature of data on the internet is really dangerous for this reason. A careless comment left on reddit in 2012 could very easily be searched for and found in 2020 or later, by ever-increasingly-powerful search tools, which will certainly lead to a wrench attack or worse. Stop downplaying this very real danger.
* " Your Bitcoin will be stolen by organized crime through viruses spread on porn sites and downloading pirated content. "
Are you actually suggesting that malware will be so successful that we have no chance of keeping it long enough to get stolen by other means? What's the point in having it at all then?

Well, the NYA signatories did not express any desire to create a 2nd bitcoin clonecoin. They only signed the NYA after being sold on the fact that they would help Bitcoin itself scale through a radical block size increase. 
They haven't wavered from that stance, (except for Bitwala) despite the evidence that their goal is unobtainable and harmful to Bitcoin. I'm sad to say the only explanation that makes sense for Belshe's argument is that he is dead-set on stealing the brand of bitcoin away from the development community and make SegWit2X the defacto Bitcoin.

What do you even mean by "bitcoin will always strive to remain united?" Have you not seen the unimaginable amount of striving to split going on in r/btc lately?
I'm not worried one bit about growth harming bitcoin... I know the core team has a hell of a good plan to scale us off-chain, and I'm not worried about growth at all as long as we don't hard fork... If so, then I'm simply selling all my coins before it's too late.

There are many level of defenses against the minority hardforkers that the majority can use to ensure we protect our nest egg.
Coordinated dumps, DOS attacking miners, even code changes to make it impossible for the minority chain to survive could all be rapidly employed after a real threat emerges. 
Heck, even if all the technical ways were ineffective, violence would surely come into the equation, such as bombing server farms, because millions or even Billions of dollars are at stake here.
Hostile people who try to fork it will figure out exactly how small and powerless they really are the moment they've caused some mining farm's profits to tumble.
I'm just afraid that the public will have lost it's trust by then... Sure the original chain can win... But will any trust be left, and will bitcoin be worth a whole dollar each after the resulting media circus that will come after the fight gets big enough for a second coin to be listed on exchanges?
This is why I doubt any exchange would list a bitcoin altcoin... They're probably smart enough to know that they'll be out of business within the month.

**Bitcoin Brokers for the US:**
*  (The IRS sees every transaction, delays getting started.)
*  (Find one of the 512+ BTMs near you)
*  &amp;  (Only deal with very highly-rated sellers)
*  &amp;  (For smaller amounts, usually requires stopping by a bank)
**Real-time exchanges for the US:**
There are many dozens of real-time trading exchanges that allow US customers to trade dollars for bitcoins, located in countries all over the planet. Even some Chinese exchanges do this, it's a really long list. Try BitFinex, Gemini, Bitstamp, BTC-E, or ItBit first for higher volumes and better prices.
**Distributed exchange, use anywhere:**
*  (But very low traffic for now, takes time to get fiat into it.)
There are also Over-the-counter exchanges by the truckload, which generally suffer the same problems as Bitsquare.
For sellers who need some fiat fast, I don't recommend using any of the above; Get yourself a visa/MC debit card from a service like Bitpay, Coinbase Shift, Coinsbank, or Wirex... The delay is MUCH shorter and the fees are better too.
As BitSquare fills up with users, the community will no longer need bitcoin banks like Circle. It's everyone's job here to help it grow, just like we do with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-06-27 09:20:56
Look, it's really, really, REALLY simple.
Bitcoin's price has NEVER gone down to levels before the last peak. There's been like 6 distinct peaks or what the press calls 'bubbles' and each time the price settles higher than it was before the bubble started its run up.
That's just new people &amp; business acquired during the hype train... Perfectly natural and hard to deny for anyone.
Therefore, the $500 level you seek to buy in is now, speaking relatively. You're never actually going to see $500 bitcoins because the price can't go down to even early 2o17 prices again... That's before the peak.
But the next peak will be 10x or so from here, as it always is, so $6000 bitcoins will be what everyone will wish like crazy they could buy after the next peak.

As you can see in block explorers like this one: [ It's clear that most blocks are literally bigger than 1MB. And that there is only one type of block. 
That's because all the data (including all witness data) is literally in the blocks, every time, but only moved to the end of each line. Segwit allows the size to get as large as the new weight constraint will allow, which happens to be under 4mb, or most likely 2 MB with today's deployment and common usage habits. 
There aren't really any limits on the number of transactions in a block; it was always about the amount of data. Clients not running segwit won't include the witness data now because it's not in the format they recognize... so they just call it a smaller block than it is.

It's super simple. Inflation is nothing but money printing. Corrupt governments print more money so they can buy more things, but then more of their money exists to buy the same amount of goods and the price of everything is forced to rise.

A large portion of the crypto community (see: all shitcoiners) actually believes that you have to have an independent token to do such things since the issuance of that token is to reward the data keepers. They simply won't believe a market can take the place of that recompension model without us making one to show them.

1) Yes there are, plenty of them. So many of them that you have to live in an r/btc echo chamber to think otherwise.
* Blockstream's C lightning prototype was a successful test, just waiting on Segwit to roll out before it can be used on mainnet.
* Bitfury's Flare lightning network tested out to be able to handle 100,000 tps at the end of July.
* ACINQ's Eclair claimed to be the first successful test if I remember correctly, but they didn't test nearly as much as blockstream did.
* BitFlyer's lightning network is in freaking japanese so I can't comment on it's usability...
* KimDotCom's BitCache lightning network is still under wraps but he says every bitcoiner will come to depend on it soon.
* Amiko Pay doesn't even need Segwit, but isn't true lightning, so the jury's still out.
* Blockchain’s Thunder network is lightning for Smart Contracts, and is pretty far along but requires segwit to activate as well.
* Then you have several internal projects that use the lightning network inside their platform, such as Yours, which they won’t be able to launch without a working lightning network. (Because there will be trillions of micropayments.) In the future we could expect all the big bitcoin providers from exchanges down to social media sites and ecommerce stores to use lightning in this way, making the lightning network extremely decentralized.
2) Writing the FAQ saves people like me from telling you this often.
3) Your obvious isn't even a decent conclusion.
4) I don't deny this, but why not both? We've got tons of coders who work hard and you'd tell half of them to stop working on scaling.

Well, Watchtowers are a proposed 3rd-party solution to a LN problem with funds being vulnerable to theft at a particular point when the recipient's LN node is offline.
Keep in mind there is already 1 service (surely more to come) that offer 3rd party LN wallets kind of like bitpay that stay online and receive your LN payments for you, so it's not 100% necessary to use a watchtower, even for a node that is turned off a lot of the time like on your home PC.  
However, bitcoiners want a trustless solution where no company can be seized by a government and disrupt the flow of money at any point, so watchtowers is the less-centralized solution.
Here are a few links describing them.

Disagree. The bubbles showed mostly pure speculation, but at the flat parts of bitcoins price, we saw gradual rises that roughly corresponded to new markets starting to use bitcoin... Obviously the darknet market was first, but there have been dozens, including gambling, VPN privacy payments, and of course failing economies like greece, venezuela, argentina, etc.
tl;dr: Bitcoin's real price is unknowable, but there is certainly a floor propped up by many small internet economies that rely on it daily already.

Reddit's on crack 80% of the time; don't worry about the list not rendering.
Examples of good ones that fit into 15 seconds requires a longterm campaign because bitcoin is a fundamental change that takes far, far, far longer to pass along the basic idea of.
If you must cut it up into 15 second chunks, you have to compartmentalize the message. Think about an assembly line; think interchangeable parts. 
Each spot must be designed to be a part of the 1 full message, but it doesn't matter which order they see them in or if they catch them all. (The more the better, of course.)
Although every spot is a branding event, the message passed has to be a feature of bitcoin that is exciting, such as "Internet Cash," "tiny fees," and "swiss bank in your pocket." (That last one's a natural because it's an obama quote.)
Each should be a truthful, useful feature and something people don't have with their normal banking today. You could also go the negative route and show the horrible, evil features of the existing banking system, one per spot, and end with a "Plan B" image at the end stating, "but now we have bitcoin."
Giving btc a more wholesome image by showing an innocent toddler running is a mistake, too. It's simply too large of a mind gap for parents to make... They need to be taken one step at a time from silk road down to magic internet money down to transparent blockchain, with each step them learning it's not as bad as they thought... Otherwise it's shields at maximum. 
Ideally, I'd like to see both types of spots running; one commercial break they are reminded that their bank just charged them a $35 overdraft fee for not having enough funds in their account... The next they learn a positive feature of bitcoin that wouldn't let the last problem happen. They could go out in pairs, and if anyone sees enough of them it would be a major education compared to what these ppl are used to.

Don't be scared... Your coins will be fine, the FSA is watching them like a hawk and a slip up like losing customer coins would mean the end of them... And BitFlyer is the biggest of the 16 exchanges with by far the most prestige in Japan.
What's most likely is that the FSA doesn't give a crap about customer inconvenience and how long your withdrawal functionality is disabled for, but it does care very much about Bitflyers AML KYC process so bitflyer is simply sacrificing your time so they can spend all of it on improving their processes and make the FSA happy.

3 years ago, When gox went down 80% of bitcoiners were customers of that one exchange and everyone was affected.
Today, there are more than 50 exchanges. Maybe 100, and huge communities growing in countries that never heard of bitcoin until last year. USD is now the 3rd biggest currency, behind the Yuan and Yen. If one exchange goes down now? It might not even make the news at all.
In fact, the "biggest" USD exchange, Bitfinex, got hacked early this year. It was a mess, lots of customers screwed over... But more protections were in place and bitfinex is still around today because they issued a debt coin to customers, paying them back slowly as their exchange gains more income.

*  (The IRS sees every transaction, delays getting started.)
*  (Find one of the 512+ BTMs near you)
*  &amp;  (Only deal with very highly-rated sellers)
*  &amp;  (For smaller amounts, usually requires stopping by a bank)
**Real-time exchanges for the US:**
There are many dozens of real-time trading exchanges that allow US customers to trade dollars for bitcoins, located in countries all over the planet. Even some Chinese exchanges do this, it's a really long list. Try BitFinex, Gemini, Bitstamp, BTC-E, or ItBit first for higher volumes and better prices.
**Distributed exchange, use anywhere:**
*  (But very low traffic for now, takes time to get fiat into it.)
There are also Over-the-counter exchanges by the truckload, which generally suffer the same problems as Bitsquare.
For sellers who need some fiat fast, I don't recommend using any of the above; Get yourself a visa/MC debit card from a service like Bitpay, Coinbase Shift, Coinsbank, or Wirex... The delay is MUCH shorter and the fees are better too.
As BitSquare fills up with users, the community will no longer need bitcoin banks like Circle. It's everyone's job here to help it grow, just like we do with Bitcoin.

Let's see... 
* Blockstream's C lightning prototype was a successful test, just waiting on Segwit to roll out before it can be used on mainnet.
* Bitfury's Flare lightning network tested out to be able to handle 100,000 tps at the end of July.
* ACINQ's Eclair claimed to be the first successful test if I remember correctly, but they didn't test nearly as much as blockstream did.
* BitFlyer's lightning network is in freaking japanese so I can't comment on it's usability...
* KimDotCom's BitCache lightning network is still under wraps but he says every bitcoiner will come to depend on it soon.
* Amiko Pay doesn't even need Segwit, but isn't true lightning, so the jury's still out.
* Blockchain’s Thunder network is lightning for Smart Contracts, and is pretty far along but requires segwit to activate as well.
* Then you have several internal projects that use the lightning network inside their platform, such as Yours, which they won’t be able to launch without a working lightning network. (Because there will be trillions of micropayments.) In the future we could expect all the big bitcoin providers from exchanges down to social media sites and ecommerce stores to use lightning in this way, making the lightning network extremely decentralized.

1. It's FAR easier to believe that you got the money in some other, less-than-perfectly-legal way, but whatever, if you're buying 50k bitcoin, we'd better help because that can be bad for us if done wrong.
2. If one were to assume you're telling the truth, they'll mention the legal channels to get lots of coins like go directly to the biggest miners and mining pools, use a big broker like Cumberland mining, or even ask big exchanges and services like Coinbase/Bitpay/Bitfinex up front if they can sell you the quantity they need.
3. Otherwise, you're not looking to give your real name and passport photo for these, and therefore you need to stick to in-person trades like Localbitcoins.com and Over The Counter stuff you can do in your area. Maybe even BitSquare can do it over time.
4. Storage is easy. Keep in mind that any and all hardware wallets do one thing very well: Allow you to spend bitcoins securely. Not spending? don't need one then. Or perhaps only one to keep a hundred coins on while you pop the rest all into well made Paper wallets.
I say learn everything you can about generating highly secure paperwallets and get a super secure pair of safes to store them offsite from each other... Then maybe get a Keepkey for the ones you'll be using in the next few years.
Screw private security companies; you'll be more secure simply not letting anyone know that they exist, because hiding them is infinitely easier than hiding a palette of gold.

Demand has simply outpaced supply.  Think of it this way:
Ten people want to buy a bitcoin each there, but only one person is listing a bitcoin for sale on the exchange... Naturally the seller can set a higher price because the others will be in competition with each other to get that one coin.
The other part of this is that it's quite hard for anyone in one country to buy bitcoins at exchanges in other countries, because banking laws restrict them from sending the fiat money out of their country.

You're mostly right... But time is the major factor here as the public needs to be convinced that bitcoin's awesome before governments take those stifling actions.
If only 1% of the world understands the power of bitcoin and how it can help them personally when govts turn on bitcoin, clamping down access to it, then yes, it would be like internet without websites, or more accurately without ISPs.
But if we get beyond 10%, or better yet, get some whole countries using bitcoin that other countries can't shut down, then the cat's out of the bag and access through a fiat exchanges doesn't matter anymore; enough people will be accepting bitcoin directly from other people for their business directly. -And there will never be a way to regulate that.

All of those obstacles you are attributing to the core devs here came with popularity, not with code changes. No one wrote a BIP to make it more expensive.  No one wrote a BIP to make it harder to get in the door.  No one wrote a BIP to push people away in any way... Those things naturally happened because bitcoin is using a decentralized blockchain, which so far has proven to offer a very limited throughput for everyone.
The difference is, the devs actually do something useful about this huge brick wall in the way, not just expand the patio area. Read the changenotes for recent versions of bitcoin core to see what exactly... Way too many to list here.

Full nodes are Bitcoin itself. You can run one like the OP described for minimal cost and in doing so you receive two benefits:
1) You hold a local copy of the entire history of bitcoin transactions, which mean your node can't be fooled by some sort of cryptoscam or hack into thinking you've got more or less money than you actually do. (Safety local ledger copy)
2) You help the network and enforce the rules of bitcoin.
You certainly don't have to but many of us want to chip in and do it for the good of all. Businesses that accept bitcoin usually wind up running them for extra safety as well.

Good issues to consider, thanks for the feedback. 
Most of your points, IMHO, are completely overshadowed by the extreme size difference between the two camps of people and their nodes. While BTC has 100k nodes, hundreds of businesses, the entire development community, mostly all of the traders, the No2x movement of people, and meetup groups around the world all firmly stating that no, they won't be having any of that BTC1 thing, the opposing side has basically not even shown up to the conversation at all and 90% of their few nodes are located on Amazon's servers. 
Any point about it being a good buying opportunity or otherwise seeing the price of B2X going up strictly begs the question, "who is doing all this buying?" A few Chinese miners and Roger alone will be only a drop in the bucket compared to the millions and millions of people who want to dump their crapcoin before they feel it goes to &lt; $1.
A couple of better points you made:


While the reverse is both good and bad for bitcoin, replay attacks on S2X are just bad for S2X. That can only help believers lose faith in their shitcoin faster.


While I think this is your best point, I don't think Jihan and his peers are so stupid as to be able to look around at all this hatred for S2X and feel that there is a similar amount of love for it. Unless he's completely delusional, he'll be careful not to throw away the majority of his stash. 
Another dimension here is that it appears Jihan and Roger are trying to pump Bcash to become the beneficiary from any fallout from this fork. That's probably their wisest move, and I could see a huge price jump in BCH before the fork resulting in it looking like a good safehaven for those fleeing S2X, but still don't want Bitcoin to win. I'd guess this can only accelerate S2X's fall, not help it.

Now to take this issue home, why don't you search r/btc for the time Austin Hill (who personally made the deal with AXA as Blockstream's CEO at the time) challenged each and every one of you to a bet with huge odds in your favor to show the slightest shred of evidence that AXA has any control over blockstream at all as an investor.

Were you reading the same page as me? Only the twitter poll could be gamed. In-person groups are the very definition of non-game-able because no one has been able to clone other people yet. The Luke-jr poll has KYC checked by Coinbase, so it is far, far more reliable than anything else besides the first.  The nodes I've been watching for 6 years now, so have all the devs, so we're all pretty sure that those aren't gamed more than a tiny bit.
Your easy dismissal of these high opposition numbers is clearly leading you down a path that will be disappointing in about 10 days.


Like I tried to explain before, it's not a huge issue during the fork, but the stronger network will have better survivability. The weaker network won't be able to relay communications as well. Still, I suspect they'll both be able to fill the role as nodes just fine.


I haven't seen that news yet, got a link?
Even if so, would you rather hold onto 100 blocks worth &gt;$115,000 each for that entire time, or dump them for some cheapo blocks that you can get paid sooner with, possibly destroying the very existence of &gt;$115,000 blocks?


I don't see a lot of evidence for this, either. Jihan Wu, who in some way or another already controls a majority of the network's hashpower, has clearly put everything into BCH, going so far as to *only* accept BCH on his website in exchange for antminers. There is little doubt in the community that his S2X support is for the purpose of more BCH profits. He may be the biggest S2X dumper of us all, in fact! Until he knows he can make the kind of income with BCH that he is currently with bitcoin, he'd be acting logically to do exactly that.


Sure, it's an incentive, but my point is that who cares at a penny? S2X will be no more important or valuable or useful than 99 other altcoins, including Dogecoin, at that point.

Agreed, but I don't see any BCH hashrate coming out of Bitcoin's 20% at all... Jihan and those that value it are squarely in the B2X camp, so BCH should only help bitcoin's hashrate during the fork, not harm it.

Yes, over the sidechain. That doesn't mean it can't be used from normal wallets in a normal way.
From their site: "RSK can scale far beyond Bitcoin in its current state. RSK scales to 100 transaction per second (same level as Paypal) without sacrificing decentralization and reducing storage and bandwidth usage using probabilistic verification and fraud proofs, as well as blockchain sharding techniques."
Meanwhile, the Smart Contracts scale much higher: "users will be able to run their smart contracts in a platform that can scale up to 2.000 tx/sec on chain and 20.000 tx/sec off chain, providing the scalability needed for global financial solutions."

It's really simple. Both banks and bitcoin store and allow you to transfer your money. 
Both banks and bitcoin allow you to have security over stored value, and then make it easy for you to send and receive that value. 
It may not seem that cut and dry to someone new to bitcoin, but as bitcoin grows you'll see that more people use it as their primary source of money, not just a token that helps you move your national money around faster.
There are already people that no longer use their old, national money. They only earn bitcoins from their work, and only spend bitcoins from their phone/PC, without need for any other money. The plan is for everyone to be doing the same someday, and in such a world, it is easy to see how you are "being your own bank."

That would take bitcoin down to 1 block per hour, maybe a little more... 
* Fees would go up because people are trying to get the same # of TXs into each of the fewer blocks.
* Bitcoin's block reward would become even more profitable to mine because of the new fees.
* Miners making a mere pittance mining the new blockchain simply won't be able to last long while $115,000+ per block goes from their pockets over to Slushpool's miners and F2Pool's pockets for the duration of the attack.
* Some of the S2X miners might even sneak back in and mine bitcoin again anonymously, identifying themselves as some other pool so they can still earn money while not appearing to break the agreement.
* That will of course raise bitcoin's hashrate and then BTC will be moving 3 blocks per hour, then four...
* All the while, the S2X coins are being sold off as fast as bitcoiners can get access to them... Shooting their price down &amp; making the S2X reward smaller and smaller the whole time. 
* Then it will become apparent to everyone that S2X's coup has failed and the rest of the miners will have to throw up their arms and say, "whelp, we tried." (In chinese, of course) 
* Honeybadger just shrugs off another day in dreamland.

There's room inbetween angels and devils, you know. 
Have you ever considered that maybe the core dev team is actually a bunch of decentralized guys without a leader where each acts in his or her own best interest?
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:03:29
Wow, a real S2X fan! My first, in fact. This shall be an honor. 


Bitcoiners? Lol... Well, we run over 100,000 nodes with the core dev's code, not BTC1, and that number has been steadily growing for years, as one would expect a natural node count to do. Meanwhile, S2X's nodes all appear at once in a few batches, and their IP addresses are mostly all in the Amazon hosting block, so judging by nodes alone Bitcoin's size is at least 1,000 Times the size of the 2xers, and probably more like 10,000 times. That's as clear as day.
The meetup groups around the world that all spoke out against 2x is also a huge clue because those are real people in person, and therefore represent real metrics that aren't in dispute. If S2X even had ONE such group it would be something to consider, but since there are exactly zero such groups backing the 2X coin it's pretty obvious that there is no grassroots support worth talking about.
Luke-jr's poll that makes people log into Coinbase as a strong KYC identifier shows overwhelming support for the core devs and against S2X, and yes, it has been shared on r/btc and around twitter several times to ensure it's not kept away from the S2X supporters.
A recent Twitter poll with over 7,200 voters shared over 150 times  showed the vast majority are against S2X too. Sure it can be gamed a bit, but that's a pretty strong showing.
Meanwhile, nearly 40% of NYA signatories themselves have even dropped out! So feel free to share all the impressive stats in support of the S2X community you have found. 


Today full nodes serve exactly two purposes. The first is to give the person running them security, keeping a local copy of the blockchain on hand means you can't be fooled by some kind of man-in-the-middle attack. The second, which every bitcoin defender should be willing to fight hard over, is that a node is the recipe for bitcoin itself. The rules that make up bitcoin; thousands of rules, such as having a 21million issuance cap. They aren't stored on a centralized server, WE keep them on our nodes, period. This means the nodes' runners literally define what bitcoin is and protect that definition.
The BTC1 code is a different, incompatible interpretation from the existing code. When a few nodes come online with BTC1 and start communicating with the 100k Core nodes, they'll be seen and blocked pretty fast, and their IP addresses will be banned as known attackers of the network. At this point you have a network of bitcoin with 100k strong nodes, and a separate network of a few amazon servers, and the two aren't talking to each other anymore.  


Of course not; we've got 20% or more of the hashrate for that, which is enough to get 1-2 blocks out every hour. I guess we'll just have to live with that until the attack is over.
 &gt; mining... validating is nearly effortless.
You left out the part where miners only will be getting less than 1% as much of a reward for those blocks they can so effortlessly mine. What's the point in considering it any further? Do you believe they are so dedicated to Barry's agreement that they'll run their business deep into the red until they're broke and can't pay the electricity bill anymore? Because that won't take many days at all.


The FOMO to dump before the coins are worthless will be far stronger this time than it was with other splits because it'll be easier to dump these and many hundreds of people are strongly, ideologically against S2X's very existence. Further, the world has read about these strongly-opinioned groups in places like Forbes so everyone already knows the dump is coming. The Futures markets are very clear on the expected outcome. 
The FOMO should be unprecedented.


Sure... Rising from $0.01 to $0.10 is a 10x profit! 


You forget that people like Roger have so much Bitcoin that it's pretty much impossible to liquidate it in time periods of less than 6 months. Paying Taxes on all the fiat gains is also unbearable to think of. All they can really do is trade for Alts if they want to move for larger amounts.

Close, but I don't see the tie as important as you do. I believe at least Jihan and probably most of them are signalling for B2X while mining BCH with some of their hashpower, and even plan to mine some BTC with some more of their hashpower after the fork by simply not revealing themselves. Right now, for instance, the majority of the Bcash mining power refuses to show their ID: 
Think they'll suddenly grow a conscience for the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:35:07
If you're just trying to argue that it takes hash to signal, then sure, no contest. My point is that there's no benefit to us for them to do so.
I'm not suggesting that we force all miners to ID themselves, but my point stands that signaling is useless. It can be turned on or off at will, and most importantly, doesn't have any consequences. Therefore talking about it like it has any sort of relevance to the success of Segwit2x is disingenuous.

I agree that you should let your opponent in a debate get their point made. I disagree, however, with Rogers point of effectively no limit just like John does. 
Here's the difference: The way Roger stated it, bitcoin was CHANGED to make blocks too small. That's the furthest thing from the truth.
Satoshi set the --&gt; LIMIT &lt;-- 1MB back in 2010. Every day bitcoin's had transactions on it, they've been trending upwards, but with popularity, eventually all PoW chains will hit any limit you set for them.
That's not a change, that's SATOSHI'S VISION. The very thing Roger is trying to claim making a change to bitcoin would have allowed.
So Perhaps John could have worded it better, but I fully agree with him that the claim of bitcoin "effectively not having a limit" is hurtful to the truth and standing in the way of all progress on the subject.

To be in control of my own savings. No one should ever be forced to  let others control their money in any way, least of all not let others inflate away the value of my savings by printing all the money they want.


Inflation, ease of confiscation, limited security options, middlemen &amp; their fees


Bitcoin's price will keep growing for the next decade or two until it is the world's most valuable asset class, &amp; at the same time, off-chain scaling will allow it to become the ideal medium for payments as well. When it starts being used as an actual currency in some smaller countries, the rest of the world will see what a great job it does for those guys and want the same for themselves. One by one, hyperbitcoinization won't be a mere option for countries; it'll be their only hope as the value flows from other currencies into bitcoin by default. If they don't embrace bitcoin, they'll simply go broke.  


It's super-simple. The sooner you go whole-hog into bitcoin, the richer you become. The same with countries. Bitcoin's going to be a game of people versus their own countries and there won't be peace in any country until the country gives in and starts saving in bitcoin themselves. It will be the first time in history that the people get rich but their government lags behind, since it's so much harder to tax bitcoin. Of course they'll find other ways to tax but the people will have the advantage since they'll be the savers first. They'll be rich; countries will be poor; therefore the positions in each government will be easily replaced with the more bitcoin-friendly.

So if Hyperbitcoinization doesn't happen (where bitcoin eats all the world's currencies and we all use it instead of dollars and euros) then I'll hold out at least into the millions of dollars per bitcoin.
I'm still betting on hyperbitcoinization though. Dollars may be the last to fall, but the first is sure to happen soon.

It's not absurd at all. Think about how bitcoin has grown from $0 to a 300 Billion market cap and there's still only a few million people in the world holding any of it. Maybe 10 million or so with actual balances. 
They aren't making any more than 21m coins for sure, and it's estimated that ~4 million have been lost for good, so actually only 17,000,000 coins for 7,500,000,000 people. (Which equals  0.00266 BTC each if equally dispersed.)
We don't have wealth equality today, but if we did, or if you choose to look at the average wealth we all hold, then how much money and savings do we all own today? (Including off-shore bank accounts, physical precious metals, and anything else Bitcoin competes with.) Studies have been made about this many times, and Credit Suisse is kinda famous for pinpointing the global average of an adult at $52,800 USD recently. 
So for the extreme adoption example, if that $52,800 were to eventually all be kept in bitcoin, logic dictates that it $52,800 =  0.00266.  This makes a single bitcoin worth $19,849,624. 
No, I don't expect that all the world's wealth will be in bitcoin one day, no matter how advanced its security is. But to say that 1/20th of that figure is impossible to me sounds just as crazy. Bitcoin is truly the best storage of value the world has ever seen and it will just keep getting better and more useful.

That depends on many factors, like where you live, what your privacy needs are, how important fees are to you, how you're paying, etc. LocalBitcoins.com has solutions pretty much globally that are pretty good, but search google for "how to buy bitcoin" and your city/country to figure out the best for you.

The mempool has skyrocketed several times before. We survive it, but sure, we lose a few to bcash when that happens. 
Although the code has been written to turn ASIC mining rigs into paperweights, the Devs know it would never get deployed in any situation other than a total &amp; complete attack by the miners. Some kind of attempt by most of the hashrate to make bitcoin unusable, such as a prolonged empty block attack to harm our blockchain. A real type of emergency. If that happens, nothing can save the ASIC mining industry at all, probably not for any altcoins, either. Asic mining will have been proven a legit security hole.

But the way our interwebs work today is that when you send someone dollars online, anyone at all, the financial pipes that get them to the person online will be tracking you all by itself.

I think what they need to do next is integrate with a service like OneName, and require that the OneName account (or any 3rd-party identity solution) has 2-way links to social profiles as well.
Sure they can be faked, but if the investors can trace them back it is a huge boon of information about a borrower, and then if the borrower's friends can see his investment through the OneName hub he'll be far more pressured to pay back as his rep is more visibly on the line.

I don't think sidechains work like you think they do.
The whole point of using a sidechain of bitcoin to be a currency is to use BITCOIN better. -And that won't be easy, because payment terminals and all kinds of infrastructure will need to recognize this new blockchain instead of just bitcoin's. 
There's no point to tie your bitcoins into a lesser currency-only coin, like feathercoin. Maybe some feathercoiners would like it, but they won't get a single extra merchant to adopt it that way. There is so much infrastructure to build up for this new coin, basically all the hard work bitcoiners have done to date would need to be repeated with new software at all of these terminals and businesses!
Any suddenly-popular sidechain that became useful for some other purpose, say, Online Ticket sales, might be extremely useful at Ticket tracking, but it's not a currency... Just a single commodity at best.
So I'm not worried; Bitcoin's got such a strong network effect that trying to catch up to it is like trying to throw rocks at a starship moving at warp speed away from you.

Artists with styles like Rap, Metal, twangy country music, 80's pop, Chinese folk, Jazz, and even a Taylor Swift impersonator have all tried to produce Bitcoin songs, most without any success... Because so few bitcoiners will enjoy more than one of those categories each.  
Still, I think the bigger problem may be the payment issue. Why start up a bigger attempt when there isn't much of a chance of getting a solid paycheck? Someone would really be taking a huge leap of faith to do that.

1. We don't convince them of crap. Once their money fails they'll have no choice but to use something else... And guess what will be readily available and already in tertiary use across the globe?
2. Because all the people are using something else, and choose to EARN something else, not their monopoly money.
3. Are you talking about the dollar? That's backed by absolutely nothing. Bitcoins, however, are extremely useful for a wide array of uses, and will very naturally come to be seen as "inherently valuable" once people understand that it always has a use as something or other.

Have you seen how huge the DJIA bubble is these days?
We're months or even just weeks away from a bubblepop on wall street so massive that all before it will look downright amateurish. 1929 will be henceforth known as the "2nd" or even "small" crash.
Such a loss of capital leaving wall street is naturally going to cause a percentage of that to land in bitcoin... But since the FinTech tidal wave has already started, this effect described in the OP will likely snowball it, making it a tidal wave, maybe even an overnight flight to Sillicon Valley &amp; Bitcoin.
Whomever isn't holding coins during the first half of that rush is going to SERIOUSLY regret it for the rest of their lives.

I guess multisig can wait, the most important part is choosing a wallet that can't be censored, (Circle and Coinbase can) and then teaching them how to use the wallet for their needs.
I'd also suggest to make it go a step further and introduce them to the idea of living in the bitcoin economy (earn and pay for things with bitcoin only, as much as possible) because whenever they do trade what they earn for fiat currencies, their money can be traced at that point by the legacy system... If they spend their bitcoins on food and rent and everything else, then they've basically got no way to be financially tracked by law enforcement.

Skyhook is the most popular because it's cheap; but there have been plenty of complaints because it's kinda flimsy.

I don't care how much money is involved, or if the entire UN and all member countries decide to outlaw bitcoin; I have coins now, and I can earn more easily. I don't need to use any service -anywhere- in order to earn &amp; spend my coins where I'd like. There is simply no way for them to control my 'entrance and exit points' because I have none.
I didn't bring up your software to accuse you of storing anything or even helping them in any way... I mentioned it because it links government to physical people, places, and things that they can stick their guns at and control. 
That alone will keep bitcoiners spending bitcoins away from your platform if there's an alternative that isn't so vulnerable.

Not absurd at all! You are'nt seeing the bigger picture. Think about the incentive for the hack.
Did Hackers primarily want account bio info? NO, They wanted Cash.
Hackers after cash on a bitcoin-accepting site would be searching for the private key of the vendor... Finding user profile info is a separate server with different login credentials. 
So perhaps a hacker with a vendetta against a single user is still able to hack in and get that user's profile info, sure... But if the hack is monetarily motivated, this entire hack either wouldn't have happened, or would have targeted AM's hot wallet.
...And don't forget that with no Credit Card information backing you up, you can give a fake name on your profile too.

Of course it doesn't. -There are dozens or maybe hundreds of different suggestions of how to "organize" a society that has embraced anarchy. 
I've read dozens of different books showing dozens of different ways it could be done in the future... All look a bit different because they have different ideas of how we get to that point; The only one I'm interested in however is the one where we decentralize the hell out of society to the point where governments can't find a foothold to survive anymore.
At that point I think the model of organization will be quite obvious... Everything will either be a private service or based on a distributed application like bitcoin.

I absolutely agree with everything Andreas is saying here.
However, I strongly hope that none of us start spreading this argument around so that banks read it and think about it carefully. 
I beleive the best weapon bitcoin has these days is the fact that permissioned ledgers, which will never compete with The blockchain, look so much like it that banks will spend their time and money over these next few critical years fighting bitcoin with ineffective tools.
They're our ultimate decoys. Go Eris! Go Hyperledger and Ripple! You CAN DO IT!
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:13:56
I see, because the PrivKey is inside the file. Gotcha.
I do have to wonder, however, if that matters to the users of this application? When I send a bitcoin to a noob who doesn't have a wallet yet, he's not even remotely worried about the service stealing it from him yet... He doesn't know enough to think about that at all, and won't until well after he's moved the loot to a new wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-28 18:36:46
NO! 
Letting banks think that "intrachains" are the same thing as The Blockchain, or at least will compete with it somehow, is our best weapon against bank attacks over these next few, critical years for bitcoin.
They're our ultimate Decoy. 
Making them look different from The blockchain will only help banks realize that their weapon to fight bitcoin is ineffective sooner.
Go "blockchains!" Go Eris! Go Hyperledger! Go Ripple!!

How about defending bitcoin in the press so often? That's not something everyone can do.
Or how about the infamous $1M bet? That sure drummed up a shit-ton of curiousity in bitcoin's price, if nothing else.
The part that irks me most about bitcoiners turning on Roger over a simple thing like 'pay to bump your fave wallet' is how many of his own bitcoins he personally gave away to grow interest in bitcoin... I'm 100% certain that any money he makes from a pay-to-bump feature can never, under any circumstance, make all those coins back he gave to everyone he met over years!

While I don't like bitcoin's name being used as a way to slander gold; I'm inclined to agree with the authors' point.
Gold might have a chance again after bitcoin reforms governments so they stop (or aren't able to allow) all this paper-shuffling trickery with gold markets.
It still has use, of course, but it's nowhere near as useful as a bitcoin is so I expect gold's price and bitcoin's price to trade places as soon as public perception allows.

All national currencies, they aren't available to the US public and would never be. -Plus, three of those you just mentioned are in just as bad a shape or worse than the USD!


There are many reasons a country like the USA won't accept another country's currency to become its' legal tender. It's a huge vote of 'no confidence' in themselves for one... But more importantly, It's not going to be readily available for 350 Million americans to start using when it's needed. Bitcoin will; bitcoins are POSSIBLE to be used by anyone when their countries' currency fails... National fiats will simply not be there.

It's not Coinbases' security we're grumbling about here.
Coinbase has above-average security measures, in fact. What concerns us is that Coinbase turns over information about it's customers to uncle sam. It obediently obeys all AML &amp; KYC rules to the letter and that means that if you send them any dollars they'll have your name and credit/debit card info in their database to be handed over to the first cop or agent that asks for it. -And in some cases they can turn over your keys to them too, basically emptying the account.
By comparisson, many wallets are not run by a company at all; they exist only as software. (Of course then you still have to get your hands on the coins, but there are ATM's that sell bitcoins and of course Johns should be the main source for that.

SABR.io is a very well-funded company which just got $1M yesterday in its' latest seed round and already had good contacts in the industry. Services like these work almost exclusively for Law enforcement, basically data-mining the blockchain and tying all of the identities they can find to all of the addresses on the blockchain they possibly can, keeping it as a big database a la Palantir.
If Coinbase and other exchanges who have to follow the laws closely are cooperating with SABR and similar businesses, we wouldn't know. They wouldn't admit it because we'd all flock to another exchange. 
Even if they aren't, law enforcers like NYDFS might force Coinbase to hand over specific identity data to SABR when it is trying to solve specific cases.

Overlooking the obvious alternatives to a despotic toll road owner; Taking a shared resource and making it owned by a concept as flawed as a government is simply worse than any form of despotism. 
Maybe once direct democracy comes about when everyone votes on their smartphone for every single issue without representation, then it wouldn't be so evil. - But the majority would still steal from the minority every time it wants something. 
When you make a commons area owned by "the public" you are not giving it to the people that need it, no matter how it is worded on the bill. You're giving it to the elites and they allow you to pretend it's yours until they don't anymore. 
For that matter, all real estate under a government is like that too. You may think you've paid off the land, but just try to stop paying taxes on it and see if you truly 'own' it. Or even keep paying your taxes but be in the way of the next oil pipeline and see how long you own it then. 
The system "working just fine" is a temporary thing at best; a tyranny of the majority more often than not.

2011 prices ranged a bit, from $1 to $30 at a peak back down to $4. If you had earned your coins after the peak in June, all the news would be bearish and negative. So you likely heard it on that downtrend, and that downtrend would have kept you thinking you were wasting your time.
3 months of mining one card back then likely would have made you a few coins, not hundreds of them, maybe a dozen or so at best. Of course, if you did mine a dozen that are worth $7k each now and managed to hold them all these years it would be epic.  
If there's nothing at the bitcoin address behind the 34-digit number, you can be pretty sure it's lost now. It would be interesting to see the history of that address, though. Maybe the pool owners swiped it from you when they  closed the account. Can you see any history for it when you look at the address on blockchain.info?  (Don't use the search bar at the top, use the one below that says the word "address" in the box.)

Forks are always dangerous while anyone is contending them. We may win but at the cost of shaking the world's faith (what little there is yet) in the idea of digital scarcity... They'll see 42 million "Bitcoins," or at least that's what the news will tell them... Not to mention, with the hashing power split, bitcoin will be wide open to a 3rd party attack, leaving ourselves vulnerable to banks and govts that would like to destroy it while the opportunity presents itself.
This goes for UASF too.

First of all, there's a major difference between the banks most people know (commercial) and Central banks. The former lends out money, the latter is in charge of issuing it. 
Commercial banks aren't allowed to issue their own, and central banks can only do so once per the country they are in. So basically, for them to do so is for them to No longer issue the old currency in their country, and instead switch to a cryptocurrency that they centrally control. 
Russia, China, and a few other central banks often talk about doing exactly that, and the threat is real. However, put yourself in the shoes of one of their citizens... They're taking away your Cash, and replacing it with a cryptofiat that isn't nearly as private that only exists on your phone. But bitcoin already exists, so if I've got to use phone money, why not use the one that lets me trade privately and has a value that always keeps going up, instead of down, like the state's currency does?
In short, bitcoin (once scaling properly) will out-compete them very easily.

The rest of the press around the world badmouths it and tells us all how lucky we are not to live in Sandy Springs, Georgia. 
I've visited there, however, and the place is opulent and cheap and safe all at the same time. Countries with the least government around the world have always trended the highest in terms of financial freedom and personal wealth.
Private police, fire, and hospitals are all of far higher quality than their public counterparts in the US. To say they aren't meant to be privatized is as ignorant as it gets. Sharpstown, a suburb of Houston, Texas, cut crime in less than half after taking their police force private:
But again, the rest of the world talks about this wonderful happening as if it's a bad thing, so the goodness doesn't spread.
That's the real world. I'm hoping bitcoin can help change this bullshit.

That's not wise in this particular situation. He does make the best product on the market, despite his underhandedness.
If his buyers (specifically the other largest miners) were really angry at him then they can form their own mining consortium to produce chips or something, but down that avenue I only hear crickets.

I think the downvoting is more about the fact that there is already too much rampant speculation by non-experts around here.
For instance, you've way undershot the price at which mining is no longer profitable... S9s mining bitcoin would likely be turned off at something around $377 at current difficulty. 
Frankly I like the speculation and encourage thought experiments... But this one is based on too many flaws up front.
You aren't wrong about LTC overtaking BTC when the price sinks that low, however. Dash, monero, and Litecoin would all likely jump up into some kind of 3-way tie and just about every business that accepts bitcoin today would throw in the towel on cryptocurrencies for a decade or more.
@_date: 2017-04-24 04:06:31
Well, Bitfury isn't selling to individuals, Avalon can't put out enough quantity to mine a dogecoin fork, and Jihan already put everyone else out of business who can make an ASIC chip.

There's many ways it could be set up, but a private blockchain like we all assume citicoin would be would not bother with decentralized miners; they'd be more like ripple or a pre-mined shitcoin. 
In that case, they'll simply have people logging in at each bank branch or whatever structure they use with a private key and have the ability to write to their "password protected excell spreadsheet" using their private key.
...So if those people are bad actors, of course they can mess with the system, and if a hacker steals their private key, of course they can mess with the system as well.

I didn't say he SAID something else, I implied he SHOULD HAVE Said something else.


Try to look two or three chess moves ahead here. What Greg did with that reveal was use a Knight to take out a bishop. Technically that's a positive thing. However, we all can see the FUD army with Jihan's paid shills just sitting there ready to spin it. Now that he feels pressured, Jihan can double or quadruple the amount of sockpuppets and FUD writers he had, and make them all declare Greg the one doing wrong and Jihan is the innocent one.
Why can they get away with that and have so many morons believe it?
Because Jihan hasn't been shown to do actual harm to his follower's interests yet.
My point is that what Greg revealed is a problem for Core devs, not for the BU followers. They've got no reason to turn on Jihan now, but if we showed that Jihan has harmed their income or the security of the network or even just the price of bitcoin, then all his followers would be forced to think, "Hey, that hurts, Jihan!"

A strawman is when you assign a fake argument to your opponent. By suggesting that a private city is "owned" by anyone is certainly not my standpoint, and sounds a bit batty to me, in fact.
As for the poor soul that lost his job, and can't afford a $25-$75 annual fee for private fire service nor homeowners insurance (also paid annually) that includes it, then sure, a sad case can slip through the cracks when someone lives too close to a private fire station and it just so happens that the firemen there are jerks.
Your examples point out the few assholes, however. Quite a lot of the fire service in the US is private already and very often they'll simply put the fire out for non-customers who live close to them, just to avoid bad press like this or to make future customers.
Meanwhile, I'd bet public firemen do a far worse job with their shoddy equipment and sense of entitlement that working for the state gives them.

Sounds sober to me.
I think where the line needs to be drawn is that we, each and every one of us, need to be much more careful about generalizing everyone "on the other side" or even those that are supporting the BU team or Jihan as the enemy.  Our enemy is smaller and more hidden that "everyone on r/btc" or everyone not agreeing with us lately.
Yes, Jihan is certainly an enemy, and Roger has crossed the line, but I know for a fact that there are people who haven't figure this out yet and are supportive of them in general without having seen all the facts yet.
Until they have, (and yes it's our job to gently show them) an all out belligerent attack is exactly what creates more enemies out of them. Kind of like how the US has been going about "fighting" terrorism the last couple of decades.
We should certainly all keep in mind that this is a battle and the stakes are high, though.

Covert usage, as an ability, is USELESS to our cause right now. Keep your eye on the ball. Proving Jihan participated in covert usage, through any means such as statistical analysis, is what will win the battle, not showing that someone could do something wrong but might not have taken the opportunity...

There are several consensus algorithms, proof-of-work is bitcoin's and the runner up most-popular is proof-of-stake... Ethereum is still technically a PoW chain but has been planning to make the jump to a PoS chain sometime soon like BitShares and other altcoins use.
PoS is basically 'he who holds the most coins makes the rules,' letting you "mine" more for holding more coins at stake. (although you don't use much energy mining.) 
Proof-of-Prime numbers and Proof-of-Domain are some other interesting models out there; they can get pretty creative, but none can be as secure as Bitcoin's PoW, simply because most of the world's computing power is tied up securing it.
...And those are just the Public chains. Private chains don't really even need a consensus mechanism, although they may claim to have one. -They're basically relying on a username and password for their entire chain's security.

One of the several important lessons learned from the  Auroracoin drop was that if people aren't mentally invested in your cryptocurrency, they won't *stay* invested in it no matter how free you make it for them to become invested.
If they don't believe there's a way to cash btc to fiat, then they simply believe that btc is worthless and throw away those private keys, univesting their minds.
If they do believe it, they'll go directly to the exchange, and assuming it's worth enough to be worth their time, they'll cash out, uninvesting their bankroll.

* As an exchange, the better your price information is, the more other big corporations and news agencies and fund managers, etc. will refer to your prices.
* It's a win-win because Gemini gets to be known as the 'keeper of the best price for bitcoin' while bitcoin gets to be known as a security with better price information.

I remember this argument was the reason for a mining push back when ASIC Block Erupters ( first hit the scene in 2013. 
Everyone I know bought a bunch of these little cuties, and I think the hashrate did see a tiny, tiny upward push for a week or less.
But then the very next model of antminer or something came out and wiped the previous hashrate level away like it was dust in the wind. Then another 2 weeks later. Then another and another.
Simply put, the hashrate grows way, way way, way way way too fast for this. It will always be economically correct to buy the most efficient mining rig and lots of it.

There will always be banks, because Bitcoin is complicated. The common folks will always want a banking-like service, but the problem the world has that bitcoin can truly fix is with the issuers of money itself.

2X is absolutely impossible to do without hard forking bitcoin into two chains because of them... That's not even counting people who don't like the 2X plan.
2X breaks away from the consensus, not the other way around, no matter how many businesses are behind it.

You need a merchant solution of some kind... A service, no matter if it is purely a software program or if it is people that do the service for you in exchange for a fee.  
In the past we used to just send everyone to Bitpay or Coinbase to sign up with their merchant solutions... It worked well for years but then those two companies both turned against bitcoin and you'd do very well to stay away from them.
BTCPay ( is the best solution we have now but it's not ready for everyone... You still need to know a little code in order to deploy it on your website.
Many other solutions exist but you usually have to rely on 3rd-parties in some way. With BTCPay you don't have to.

Greg is without a doubt underappreciated. Just in the fight against Jihan alone he deserves 10,000 medals.
However, it should be noted that this description pretends he has power that he simply does not wield. Consensus is the only power that gets any big code changes made in Bitcoin.
If there is any one thing that is not well described and understood in the entire bitcoin community, it is how decisions are arrived at between developers.  These smackdowns are a major part of that process. 
Greg is one of many great devs with a solid head on their shoulder who thwart the idiots trying to 'fix' bitcoin on a daily basis. For those who would like to study the process for yourselves, I highly recommend just jumping into the bitcoin development mailing list and watch, over time, how ideas arise &amp; fall, or get made into bitcoin. It's fascinating and probably the best example in earth's history of peaceful Anarchy working.

Lol, no.
It's sad that you can come up with such a list. I'm as maximallist as they come, with a full expectation of hyperbitcoinization, but these just demonstrate a complete lack of understanding the position!
We understand: 
* Bitcoin's fragile but antfragile at the same time... It will moon if successful... Go to 0$ if not. 
* The moneybadger can be stopped by a few specific technical means for now that we don't like talking about just in case someone powerful is listening. It can also be stopped by the world simply not wanting to be free.
* All counterarguments we hear are typically put together by noobs &amp; easily shot down.
* You should **never* take out high interest loans to invest in a speculative asset. Those that have were lucky as F&amp;CK because the market is able to stay irrational longer than the terms of any such loan.
* Bitcoin *Tends to* replace all fiat over time through hyperbitcoinization, but even if it does, we have to wonder what century we'll get to every last currency.
* Once fiat is replaced, taxation will be much harder for countries, so they'll have to find some other way to pay for their roadmaking &amp; beauracracy addictions that will likely cause countless revolutions until they figure out the least intrusive way to do it. At least these insane defense department budgets will be slashed considerably in the meantime. By the time they figure out the right way to run a country without taxation, our great grandchildren will likely have off-world options to go make their utopias.   
* Everyone will become more in control of their own destinies once they take more control over their own savings.
Still sound absurd to you?
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:38:17


No, and for 3 reasons:
* You don't have majority mining power behind you. (Meaning that our mining hashrate will suffer from miner loss)
* You're not claiming to be THE bitcoin and therefore trying to fire all the existing core developers from working on their own project.
* You're not a perceived leader in the bitcoin space like Barry, Jihan, and other CEOs here are, and therefore won't be getting all the mainstream news facetime to convince investors that bitcoin has moved to a new chain. (Which would have the effect of only telling investors that there are now 42m bitcoins.)


Like a fruit fly, sure.
 
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:20:20
The real problem here is that you only seem concerned with which will win.
Even if Segwit2x would be the winner (it won't) the damage to bitcoin is too extreme before the winner is found. 
When the fork happens, a brand war is unavoidable and the lack of replay protection on BTC1 guarantees it will be messy with people losing coins or making double spends left in right, adding utter chaos. Imagine how that will look in the media! At least for one or two news cycles:
* Two bitcoins will exist, both claiming to be the 'real' bitcoin.
* Civil War inside bitcoin will be in full gear, with industries and miners in an all-out no-holds-barred war against the developers and most node holders.
* Bitcoin "no longer works" at that point because of the replay attacks.
* Hashrate for bitcoin will now be split a third way and bitcoin's security will be the weakest it has ever been. Expect even more attacks against this easy target!
* Bcash, although weaker in hashrate than before, could stand to greatly benefit from this chaos and look like the winner in the end due to how it's competitors are both 'broken' in investor's eyes.
**ALL of that will happen if BTC1 simply initiates their pointless fork.**
Who gives a flying figleaf who the winner will be anymore? Bitcoin's price could go below $1 on that kind of mass chaos and breakage!
This is an unavoidable price you have to take into consideration for keeping your 2X 'promise.'  This is a bay of pigs moment. Do you think JFK keeping his promise to fire the nukes first would have been the right thing to do?

I just can't see LN happening @ Coinbase and any exchanges that touch fiat. These guys have to follow KYC/AML laws to the letter, and by implementing a channel for payments that uses onion routing, (and can't be used without onion routing) they wouldn't be able to report both the source and destination of their LN outgoing and especially their incoming payments. 
Outgoing, I bet they could work really hard and put together a pre-built "approved merchants" database that can send your money to merchants on their approved list. That really handicaps how useful lightning is, however. No coinbase customer could send a LN TX to a vendor or any LN address at all that isn't pre-added to their DB. 
Incoming TXs are much worse. They simply would not be able to accept any money arriving from a customer over a LN channel. LN is extremely KYC resistant and there'd be no way to ensure that the person who says they sent them money is actually the person who did send them money. 
I guess they'll learn the hard way... Better yet, they won't learn, and most new users will just use Coinbase to buy BTC that they send to their own, personal LN wallets.

I disagree, after many years of banging the drum trying to make others see the point you're trying to make to me. It has proven itself false. The only thing that gives bitcoin value is the belief it will be worth more one day. That's it. 
That's exactly why I don't want to spend it, too. I feel like each of my bitcoins is already worth $1M because one day I expect them to actually be worth that. Why toss away $1M assets now for $4k? Sounds like a MASSIVE lack of respect for the coin to do that to it.

Lately China has been the biggest factor slowing down bitcoin's spread. Mining centralization there has been a constant thorn in the side of scaling and other types of development, and right now those miners have even split their hashrate with an altcoin, making bitcoin less secure. It's a bit like building a castle and then letting your brother in law move in, but he junks up the place, stopping castle construction from finishing and constantly leaves the drawbridge unlocked.
There will definitely be gains from removing a point of centralized power over bitcoin. Hopefully Japan and Russia both step in to quickly compete for that space. 
The Chinese won't be able to buy their coffee with bitcoin until they face down their government on the matter, but for those few really important transactions that they really need to make, like moving their nest egg out of the country when it's at risk, Bitcoin will be there for them soon via satellite and P2P mesh.

Your problem is that you don't know how the existing open source community does things. There are rules and a solid way of doing things to avoid projects from stepping on each others toes... A ruleset that encourages forking but NEVER stealing anyone else's brand or claiming someone else's work is your own.
I guess when code became money the stakes were raised, so you're not the first to do this... But think about how many linux distros are out there... Literally over a thousand. Yet in that whole body of work consisting of a thousand or more development teams, not once has any fork stolen the name of it's parent that it forked away from.
You can create any forked altcoin you want, but to use political power to say it's THE bitcoin brings us to a brand war. 100 Thousand bitcoin nodes will NOT be switching with you, so in the end it's futile... But in the meantime it's horribly, horribly, nightmarishly damaging to bitcoin's price and reputation.

I'll give you one more hint... Not tax advice, but a view into a hodlers lifestyle, nonetheless...
If you save in BTC and only spend your fiat through some sort of debit card solution, say, Coinbase's shift card, Bitflyer, Bitwala, Spectropay, Bitpay's visa card, or any of a dozen others, (Just not Xapo because you hold your value in BTC on the card) then you won't be cashing out for every purchase... You send BTC to fiat to hold on the card like once a month or more and live day to day on that money, which is normal cash on a debit card with a normal bank... I think of it as my "bitcoin cache."

There are four restrictions on the network that block sizes are constrained by to my knowledge. Disk space is the least important of the four. 
Latency is the worst. As blocks get bigger they take longer to move around the planet, and that's not a limit that raises... It's constrained by the speed of light already. Larger blocks make it harder to keep the blockchain in synch by giving miners less time to construct a block. No one has done a good study yet on where this grinds to a halt but it's not that far away.
Bandwidth costs are next. Sure, bandwidth allocations will keep going up over time, but it's already an expense with 1MB blocks that turns some people away. With 8MB blocks it would already fill up an entire Gigabit (like google fiber) connection! So while subject to moore's law, it's already a constraint today that is limiting the node count now and is getting worse because Segwit was a block size increase.
Third worst is RAM. Raspberry Pis only have 2-4 GB room for RAM onboard, and even if you ignore those nodes, (bad mistake) consumer home PC motherboards won't allow more than 128 GB for the very expensive boards that you are allowed to buy and take home. That'll stop Blocks from getting any larger than 16 MB. Even that would be so expensive that the node count will drop to just a few hundred nodes IMHO... And to go larger than that, you need CSW's $20,000 rack-mount nodes. No thanks.
Finally Disk space is a considerable expense around 16MB blocks too, but we have pruning now so it isn't an absolute deal-killer... It just creates more upkeep work for node runners.

* Do you NEED for the resulting price drop under $1000 to happen because of all the above and because Bitcoin can't even create blocks anymore once the miners all leave?
* Do you NEED for all the current NYA signatories to be blackballed from the community, including our largest wallet and payment processor, setting the community back 5 years of technological progress?

This is bikeshedding.
The only thing anyone really has a problem with here is the hard fork away from consensus while trying to retain the brand name of bitcoin. (By not enabling replay attack protection.)
I would love nothing more to see Segwit2x's plans go off without a hitch while enabling RA protection. Do that and bitcoin will prosper greatly without that group you feel is in the majority using bitcoin anymore.
Fail to enable it, however, and investors will only see two chains with different camps of nerds behind each of us claiming that ours is the true bitcoin while the other is an altcoin... But they won't know who to trust so will just dump all bitcoins and move on to ethereum, litecoin, and others.
It's a proven recipe for disaster.

China's got a different use case for bitcoin than the rest of the world; they aren't adopting it at all beyond some powerful miners and gamblers at exchanges. There aren't any shops in the country that accept it as money and the mindset there assures that they won't be doing so any day soon.
The looming threat of the PRC either banning Bitcoin or outright nationalizing the mining industry there scares the hell out of traders far more than any benefits from adoption there can help the price.
One day more than a midget's handful of people in that huge country will want to use bitcoin for its intended purpose. When they do, P2P tech and satellites in space will be there for them to ensure bitcoin can't be censored there.

Roger is no mere spectator though!  
He spends millions of dollars on projects to fight bitcoin too. Constantly. 
* He &amp; Jihan paid $1m for Bitcoin Unlimited development. 
* His mining pool has been operating at a loss in order to attract &amp; bribe miners to mine BU and anything else since that was anti-core. 
* He's been caught paying for tweets against core devs. 
* He's been holding conferences around Asia where he puts people like Satoshi Dundee on stage to lie about Core development. 
* Worst of all, his domain, Bitcoin.com, runs a popular news site that slants much of it's news against core development too. It even has a splash page on the front of the news site that tells newbies to bitcoin that bitcoin has been taken over by corporate interests so stay away from core development!
Not to mention, someone has been funding millions &amp; millions of dollars worth of spam to the network since early 2015 too in the hopes of showing how much we need big blocks. Besides Roger &amp; his partner Jihan, not many people can afford to do that.
This sort of behavior is not only abnormal in the development world, I would imagine many lawsuits and death threats were made for less of this type of behavior.

Yeah, it's a bit crazy. He and Olivier (past director of the bitcoin foundation and the guy who still runs Bitcoin Classic) are Anarcho Capitalists that are going to do the most ironic thing imaginable and pick one country to trust with billions of dollars and their actual lives.
Land is sold all the time, but Sovereignty has never been sold. (Excepting only to other existing sovereigns.) You just can't buy freedom like that on a world where every country out there has a vested interest in not allowing new neighbors in their neighborhood. I imagine there have been other attempts in history where some wealthy merchant buys an island or city away from a country and then is never heard from again... So naturally those don't make it into history books, written by the victors of those 'wars.'  
One that was recorded was pretty tame though; a reef built up (by the colonists, previously underwater) in 1972 called Minerva.  The nations around it wouldn't let the colonizers have it and they retreated before there was bloodshed.
We've also seen examples where new land was made and nearby countries came and blew them up. The Republic of Rose Island was a floating platform in the Adriatic sea (international waters) near Italy. After a few months of what they called "tax evasion," Italy landed troops, took control, and blew up the platform with dynamite. 
It's extremely Naive to think countries are going to allow new neighbors that they can't tax and call their own. Seasteads may stand a better chance out in the deep ocean with no neighbors nearby to make a claim on them, but the problem then becomes deep-sea weather conditions, which are capable of destroying anything man has ever made before.
Anyway, I don't see any indication that Olivier and Ver will be dropping bitcoin, or at least bcash, at any rate. In his mind Roger knows he'll need a currency in that new land.

In May 21 exchanges got together &amp; issued a group-signed statement for pretty much exactly this when the threat at the time was Bitcoin Unlimited forking off:
 
They demanded full replay protection at the time, but the problem is now that several of the exchanges on that list are also signers of the NYA. 
They see /BTC1 as 'the' bitcoin... So even at the exchange level, this is turning out to be a Brand war.
Maybe if another large group (even not including the NYA signatories) come out again and say the same thing this time, specifically calling BTC1 the altcoin, it can all be diverted... But if they don't we don't have much of a chance of exchanges saving the day, considering some of the biggest signed NYA.

Have you run the numbers? Bitcoin can handle 3-4 Transactions per Second before it starts bloating the mempool and fees start shooting up. 
Amazon sells something like a million items every 3-4 seconds. The amazon execs might not be idiots for thinking that this payment method needs to grow a bit more robust first.
We'd all love to see it happen, but I'm with Tone on this one; If bitcoin were to get 100 TPS thrown at it, fees could go to $1000 per sale within a day. This wouldn't go over too well in the media, I believe.

@_date: 2017-10-15 21:32:10
It was somewhere on bitcoinmagazine.com
Unless the S2X team backs down causing no split at all, by far the most likely outcome will be that on fork day, bitcoin's blocks slow to 1/4 or 1/5th their current speed and fees go up, attracting more miners back to the real bitcoin within hours to days. 2xers will fail spectactularly, but they'll likely still think somehow that hashpower is more important than nodes so we'll just have to keep laughing at them for years. 
Anyway, be prepared to have network disruptions for a day or three while that fork goes on, otherwise, it should all clear itself up automatically. The price may dip during it all too, of course.

But the system  you have spelled out here implicitly destroys the latter option. There is no way in hell she can take responsibility for her private key in such a simple interface.
Several hundred of the world's most brilliant coders have been working on bitcoin for about a decade now. ALL of them would love to see the killer app that you are speaking of, but none of them were able to overcome the fact that responsibility is a double-edged sword. You can't remove all responsibility from this app while at the same time retain the freedom that makes bitcoin special. It has to stay decentralized and not reliant on the state in order to attain and retain any value.

Lol... I guess you don't know what a brand is then. 
It has nothing to do with the legal system; in a fully anarchic society vendors would still promote their brand, and even if they didn't, their consumers would talk about good products under a brand, for the sake of convenience.
Even if a vendor or project refused to identify themselves, consumers would be forced to say "Be sure to only buy the widget from that 3rd stall from the left, the anonymous guy with the great big blue widgets."
That's a brand. It exists for the sake of other people to link quality of workmanship to a line of products.  
Bitcoin is certainly a brand... The Core dev's brand of decentralized money. 
If you try to steal the brand of any quality product, consumers will figure you out and shun you for brand theft. The brand will survive.

* No. That's like saying Gold's value is reliant on the value of fiat. We just price things in fiat now for convenience, until bitcoin's price stops being so volatile.
* You can always say a gallon of milk costs two bits, (0.00000200) two finneys, (0.00000020) or two satoshis. (0.00000002)
* Hoarding is great for bitcoin's price, but you'll find as you get richer, it gets really, really tempting to spend the newfound wealth on things you couldn't afford before. Satoshi must either be dead or have sent all his bitcoin to black hole addresses. 
* You can take out loans in bitcoin all over the world now. I wouldn't advise taking one in bitcoin though because since the price usually goes up, it becomes harder to pay them back... But still, there is risk on both sides due to the price so right now it's basically gambling, like manually playing the futures market. 
After the mainstream is fully adopted, (top of the s-curve) we'll see the price fluctuation slow down and of course many/most/all currencies will be gobbled up by bitcoin... By then everyday items will be priced in btc and it won't have any more 20% price fluctuations because everyone will be holding/earning/spending in it daily.

Some will waffle, sure, but Bitfinex was pretty clear that they aren't going to name Segwit2X "Bitcoin." As the largest USD volume exchange, that's pretty important to get right.


Realistically, F2Pool's 10%, Slush's 1-5% of miners who opt to mine BTC, plus the 5% or so of smaller exchanges not aligned with 2X put bitcoin between 15 and 20% of the hashrate. It wouldn't hold up to a 51% attack, but if all goes well, we'll see around 1 block per hour on Bitcoin with that hashrate.
The good news is that this is a self-solving problem. Jihan may mine at a loss for a while, but many of the other miners will be pulled over by the huge fees that result in such slow blocks.
I bet we'll see lots of anonymous hashrate from S2X pools mining bitcoin because they can't stand losing out on the profits.

When you hear about mining being unprofitable, it's likely because you heard it from someone with a small setup, not one on industrial scale.

November's fork is extremely different because both "sides" are fighting to be "the Bitcoin" on the day of the fork. Cryptocurrencies have never seen such a scary event before... It's pretty unthinkable and could destroy all trust in the system.
If the 2X fools don't give up before then, you're going to hear two phrases thrown around quite a lot in November:
"Brand War" &amp; "Lawsuit"
The price of bitcoin could dip below $1k if they actually go through with it, but I no longer see that as a likely outcome.

Ah, so you're someone who considers ignorance a positive trait. Good to know.
Those little rules evolved that way out of necessity. If you'd have been paying attention to core development via their devlist or IRC chat, you could see them in action and see how useful they are for keeping the good ideas floating to the top.


It simply means identity in this case. Your name is your brand. 
What BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, and now Segwit2X have all done is attempt to steal the identity of Bitcoin away from those who are passionately working on it. That's simply identity theft.


I certainly don't either. The code is strong, the devs behind it are brilliant, the users are awesome and plentiful... It will survive anything, I'm convinced. But a brand war could really hurt the price and give another coin a chance to pass it by if the world can't even identify which bitcoin is which for a certain period of time!


I almost agree with you there, but what if the price falls below, say, ether or litecoin and stays there for a while... Merchants might switch to one of those coins and we'd have lost the entire early-adopter network effect, basically becoming the altcoin while some altcoin starts racking up the commerce and adoption. Sure, Bitcoin's developers will make the better code but network effects are extremely powerful. We simply don't want to take the chance of falling that far in the first place.

Your showdown scenario overlooks the major unanswered question: Will those accepting S2X accept it as bitcoin or as an altcoin beside bitcoin. 
The entire point of the NYA was to strictly NOT make an altcoin, but to replace bitcoin with the code in /BTC1.  They don't want anything less.
So if an exchange de-lists bitcoin and lists BTC1 in Bitcoin's place, we have a brand war, with replay attacks likely, and bitcoin could absolutely fail as the world won't know what bitcoin is anymore and feel that at the least we now have 42m broken bitcoins.

This argument ignores the extreme damage done to the name of bitcoin during a brand war.
The difference between a Bcash-like fork and 2x's fork is that this time the splitters are saying "No, WE'RE the real bitcoin." They'll tell the press that. They'll send out their hoards of press releases and get the investors confused as to which bitcoin is the one that they see when looking at the charts. That's a brand war and it's ugly as sin. You DO. NOT. WANT. it.
The May announcement by the 21 Bitcoin exchanges demanding for strong replay protection should have stopped this situation but it did not... Some of those same 21 exchanges are NYA signatories! 
So we're basically facing a brand war until we can kill 2x. Which chain the users prefer DOES NOT EVEN ENTER INTO IT... That all comes after the damage of the brand war that happens starting on the moment of the fork.

We're not scared of it's coin eventually winning against bitcoin. That's a time-consuming process where the market would vote it's preference and we're all for the market voicing it's preference.
We're actually kind of scared of what happens the very minute of the fork itself... Unlike bcash and other forked-from-bitcoin altcoins, S2X is not playing fair and implimenting replay protection. Further, they have voiced their declaration that they are making S2X to be "THE" bitcoin, never an altcoin. They plan to disrupt our existing network my moving most of the mining power away and override our currency's brand with their software.
They're underestimating the importance of nodes, of course, but there will still be some major disruption and a bit of a brand war at the time of the fork.

You don't seem to get it. The EXACT same method can change both. So if any bad people out there see one happening, they instantly know without any doubt that they can achieve the other.


Segwit proved that it can without a hard fork.


That's not just a precedence, it's an inescapable fact.


While production is certainly behind where it should be for ideal adoption, the problem with this statement is that it discards the importance of the development community, who sticks with bitcoin (and their investment) through thick and thin. 
If they can't get bitcoin upgraded quickly, then they'll do it slowly... But no coin like dash or BCH is going to pass bitcoin by because bitcoin's dev team has all of the talent in the space and the hurdles every coin has to overcome to reach massive adoption is far too big of a problem for altcoin devs to solve.
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:47:59
Here, the moderation policy says don't spam us with altcoins. You may not like that they include bitcoin cash and segwit2x in that list, but that's a normal policy to see in a super-popular place like this.
On r/btc, however, they silence ALL dissent through their heinous 10-minute wait period. Far more sinister, because anyone who has shown dissenting opinion over there loses all arguments from the sheer number of replies they can't keep up with.
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:37:08
Which parts aren't obvious? Gavin digging Segwit? 
To imagine that the devs are even capable of "discussing anything with the users and get an opinion" is to be oblivious to what the devs are. 
The devs exist as hundreds of individuals with no organizational structure, no leader, no followers, and no speaker. They don't have a way to officially poll for the opinion. They are against the very idea of it. They also don't have a way to communicate their findings... The bitcoin.org website sometimes does when it's something really important like the segwit2x warning, but that's just Theymos and Cobra doing it independently. 
They also don't have a way to 'force their beliefs' on anyone through censorship, but it could be argued that Theymos does. He also hasn't written any code in a long time and has no way to force his beliefs on the others.
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:49:14
I guess I can understand the confusion... The two statements do seem at odds, but it stems from a widely-held misunderstanding of how Bitcoin's open source development community is a rare and special balance that is uniquely qualified to allow for bitcoin's development without a centralized point of failure/control.
The code in Github's /Bitcoin directory has such a major advantage over all possible clients that it's basically impossible to displace. Bitcoin's meritocracy works like a gravity well for talented developers &amp; cypherpunks. They fight each other constantly, but need each other to get their code made into bitcoin. So if some new, talented developer out there has an idea that they want to get made into bitcoin, their choices are to either launch an alternative client by themselves, and fight bitcoin's entire development community and network effects, or they could jump into the open source project themselves and get the best developers online to help them make their idea come to life.
A surprisingly large number of the people who made so much important code in this world today are already bitcoin devs. Fighting against that is kind of like challenging the US military to a shoot-out; you against all of them at once.
Therefore, it's pretty safe to assume that ex-bitcoin developers like Garzik, Gavin, and of course Hearn had some beef with the core devs' collective mindset and could not get the support they needed because their vision of what bitcoin is differs too much from the community's vision. Those three were certainly more open to corporate environments and KYC use with bitcoin, for instance. 
So while a hard-fork away from bitcoin isn't hostile in of itself (because with proper replay protection both coins can co-exist peacefully) the word attack is extremely befitting a fork that maintains that it is "the bitcoin." That fight over bitcoin's name/brand is literally a fight to take control away from the unique, decentralized community that has all the talent in it and has been working hard for most of a decade to maintain their decentralization while at the same time watch after their assets.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:57:56

Why don't you try it today? It's completely different. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:30:56
Forking code is completely normal in the open source software development community. It's like when you have one distribution of linux, say, Ubuntu, and another dev team comes along and uses the Ubuntu code as a basis for creating a new distribution, for instance, Mint. They always make a new 'brand' of linux, however, but when it comes to code that is money, we get schiesters and conmen trying to fool everyone who will listen that they can keep the brand of bitcoin on their new fork of the code.
It's called theft when they try that, but there are very few laws in this space so it's up to us as a community to protect Bitcoin from those forkers, including the Segwit2X effort.
Here's one of the best breakdowns of the situation you could ever find:

If we let them force a change to bitcoin this way, what's to stop governments from coming along and using the same route to make the changes they want to bitcoin? 
Bitcoin's survival depends on us showing the world in November that bitcoin is truly immutable. It's users won't let changes be made to it at all.

No, that's factually incorrect. 
The few specifically called maintainers (led by Wladamir, website at bitcoincore.org) could be argued to be an organization, but they are just a specialization of the development team, which is far larger (Github shows 473 contributors today) and made of individuals just pitching ideas at the crowd. 
It's a shame people prefer to see something highly decentralized as a centralized entity. Reminds me a lot of how noobs see bitcoin at first.

They're technical problems, not feelings. They existed then too.
2 years ago Segwit was proposed but not coded yet...

It took a while for that to finish, and then the Miners delayed everything for half a year by not running segwit.

These are Bcash arguments.  assumes bitcoin is used as a payment system or finds value because people expect it to be so. The argument is weak and not supported by pretty much any evidence at all.
Number 2 &amp; 3 overlook bitcoin's largest asset by a few orders of magnitude. They nearly completely discard the VAST value of the core dev team, which isn't clear to everyone for the first few years so I understand why these arguments get made.  But in a nutshell, the expertise behind bitcoin will keep it outcoding &amp; the price outperforming the crap out of all of those threats and competitors.

As you saw in the news story, temptation to buy things you couldn't afford before will keep us parting with our coins. It certainly did me back in 2013. :(
Eventually though, everyone will be earning bitcoin and it'll be spread out so thin that the volatility will go way down, allowing us to price things in bitcoin directly instead of quoting prices in dollars.
When that happens, we'll see the growth rate slow and bitcoin will be the only money anyone uses anymore... Anything else will be too inconvenient.

That's not fully accurate. They're an NYA signer, but the OB1 team isn't fully on board with the S2X vision. They've also said that they'll be supporting the BTC version of OB as the primary version.
A lot of people are underestimating the importance of this app to bitcoin, however. Bitcoin is a censorship-proof money, but it has exactly zero censorship-proof markets to use it at. Darknet markets were supposed to be that, but few have survived police raids and the rest may very well be honeypots. OpenBazaar isn't capable of that fate for the same reason Bitcoin isn't.
Despite the slow start, Bitcoin needs OB more than most people know. It could very well still be the fabled app that takes bitcoin to the mainstream.... So lets try not to scare them off to go support some altcoin now, please.

You asked if I cared. I told you why we wouldn't. Stop it with the strawman theatrics.


You do realize that bitcoin was designed as a decentralized software made up of nodes, right? ALL bitcoin is, ALL of it, is defined as what software those nodes run. Miners don't get any way to dictate that node software, other than of course running their own nodes. That's it.


No. The way bitcoin expresses our opinion is by node count of which software we're running. There isn't another way to express our opinion that the network recognizes or reacts to. Meanwhile, the way those politically-minded assh*les that signed NYA will be expressing their opinion is by running to grab TV coverage and convince larger audiences that bitcoin was "upgraded" or some such Lie when they've been attacking the bitcoin network in actuality. This is not a difference in opinion, it's a tactic in guerrilla warfare. 


You wish. Please stop projecting your fantasies on me.
I have a few concerns about S2x, mainly people's behavior like will Jihan 51% attack the legacy chain while we're weak or even mine a bunch of empty blocks on top of it making it hard for us to resurrect it before we can change the PoW.
Actually, a more basic problem with S2X is that this political means of subverting the development team is the exact and only way to change Bitcoin's 21m scarcity limit. Therefore, if S2x wins, bitcoin is proven non-scarce, or soon to be so.

You mean the maintainer crew? There are only three doing the merges these days, No blockstream or other corps involved. Still, they can't merge anything the dev community didn't overwhelmingly agree to become bitcoin though. You act as if there is someone in charge when in fact Wladamir and the other pair of volunteers are basically the janitors.


Anyone who disagrees with it is treated the same as the other 375 core devs who have submitted code to become bitcoin but haven't been included yet. It's far more common than not for a dev to try to code up his or her vision of bitcoin just to find it doesn't receive unanimous support. ...And that's a great thing. It keeps the crap code out... Probably worth half of bitcoin's value alone.


I think you know how dishonest &amp; divisive that comparison is, especially with Chinese politics sitting at the exact opposite end of the spectrum from the libertarian roots of Bitcoin. Politics in general is the opposite of what an open source development project does. You really should study one in detail for yourself before you make such baseless &amp; slanderous accusation.


A lot of people in this sub have the knowledge to head over to github.com/btc1 and see that none of the present core development team has any admin rights there. Pretty much just Garzik does. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that if btc1 steals the brand of bitcoin from it's current location, they'd be out of a gig. A few devs have even said on twitter that it would be absolute proof that bitcoin can be coopted too easily and therefore the experiment has failed... They'd be off to find something else to work on if that happens.


1. There wasn't for years, so that statement is provably false.
2. Bitcoin development is decentralized as it is now... It could become very centralized very quickly if it were handed over to someone like Garzik.  So I find your statement either hilarious or malicious.


This is a very naive statement already. If there was a leader behind the Core devs, sure, it could be done. But up until now, overwhelming consensus behind the core dev community has been against raising the block size because they see it as a poor scaling solution. So it's actually obvious that they *cannot* raise it.

The difference is that the creation of a bitcoin derivatives market doesn't require buying any bitcoins. So far we've only had people buying and selling what amounts to bets on whether the price will go up or down... And excepting only on LedgerX, those bets were settled in fiat, not with real bitcoins.
An actual ETF has to buy the underlying bitcoins in order to use them. It's that buy-in at the front that we're all hoping will push the price past the moon, which would happen so fast you'll likely see the price move parabolic before you know the ETF was approved.

The thing is, for Jihan, it's not ideals. I doubt he has any. What he has is a very tried-and-true Chinese custom that basically dictates working at a loss until you have achieved a monopoly. That's like Chinese Business School 101 strategy. I think Genghis Khan started that trend, in fact.
What we're really hoping for here is that fees go up just enough to be irresistable to miners that are closer to the fence. (But not so high that it scares more businesses over to S2X.)

GDP doesn't include so many other things we value today that bitcoin can replace, such as precious metals (as a store of value.)
We'll probably never eat 100% of gold's market, but since cloud money is far more useful than bricks in a vault, I'm convinced we'll get the majority of it one day. That should go for many other stores of value too. 
I don't think GDP really accounts for offshore banking, either. Bitcoin will certainly eat that entire niche before long, and it's valued in the trillions.

Hard forks are always going to create spin-off chains though. If we move to a new chain with a new algo, you have to know that some trolls or bastards will keep the old chain alive and have the right to call it the original bitcoin.

&lt;This is not investment advice&gt; 
Nope, it's simple supply and demand. Even if only the current millionaires tried to own 1 bitcoin each, there's no way in hell they could all get one of the 21m bitcoins, so a bidding war would ensue resulting in multi-million dollar bitcoins to the winners. 
So you don't have to be an economist for this particular question. Either bitcoin has a great future as some sort of global world currency or at least gold replacement, and the price will eventually reach way over $1m, or it will fail to get there for one reason or another and be worth very little, maybe a few bucks a coin a souvenir money one day.

+1 to everything Cryptolution said, but he did get off topic a bit and forgot one important answer to your question:
Something else important that this means is that the ~35% or so of the clients with a 15 in them will be completely rejecting all contact with the attacking Segwit2x nodes that intend to replace bitcoin. The higher we can get that number, the harder it will be for those attackers to take over, and even communicate with each other.

Thanks for demonstrating how people that don't get the point of open source are the ones that are causing the problems.
Open source has existed since long before bitcoin, there are literally over a thousand Linux distros that have forked off in this manner. All open source, many without so much as a second dev behind them.
The thing is, Bitcoin is a brand like Ubuntu is a brand. You don't see someone fork a new linux version off Ubuntu and call it "the true Ubuntu." That would be called "theft." Yet we're now in our 4th bitcoin fork trying to steal bitcoin's brand. It's absolutely pathetic how so many don't understand the basics of Open Source. (Or conveniently ignore it like lowly thieves.)

I'm not going to call it 'impossible,' but it certainly isn't something that a beginner is going to stumble into since thousands of brilliant minds have worked on this projects thousands of times in the last few decades alone and haven't been able to accomplish it.

If there was a gun to my head and I was told I had to invent it in 24 hours, I wouldn't link it to anything but bitcoin. PrecMets and old-world investments all come with huge baggage, and you can't effectively use smart contracts on them yet.

Their list of 6 or so wallets is a small drop in the ocean of wallets we have out there. It doesn't even include several of the very most popular wallets, including Blockchain, Samourai, Jaxx, Mycelium, Exodus, and ALL hardware wallets!
As a user of a wallet not on that list, BIP70 costs me two TX fees to use at all... One to send from my current  wallet to the new wallet on that list, the second to pay the invoice with.
That gets really ugly when you consider Bitpay uses a 15-minute countdown on their invoices... So in order to pay a BIP70 invoice, I currently would have to:
1. Generate the invoice, starting the countdown
2. Copy the BIP70 address and the amount on the invoice, sending them somehow to the two wallets I'm using that may be on separate computers.
3. Send the amount plus a fast confirmation fee from wallet 1 to wallet 2.
4. Wait for it to arrive with 1 confirmation. (Unless the new wallet supports 0-conf)
5. Figure out how to put the funky BIP70 url into the new wallet.
6. Ensure the fee is FAR larger than it needs to be, like 10x too large for even 1-block confirmation, because Bitpay demands ginormous fees.
7. Send the BIP70 TX, finally, and of course by then the 15 minute window is probably finished so you'll be getting nasty error messages from Bitpay and have to wait for email confirmation saying they received it eventually.
Yeah, this is truly an awesome way to pay.  /s

What you're calling a niche purpose is simply the entire ball game. 
Every other problem with bitcoin, including bloat and block times and everything else you are letting yourself be influenced by, are simply going to be solved or put up with because the need is too great to have a single cryptocurrency prevail.
In terms of user adoption, bitcoin's network effect trumps everything. It is basically worth a trillion times more than every improvement that every altcoin ever has, all put together. Past &amp; future. It doesn't matter if someone invents an altcoin that can is anonymous, has instant confirmations, pays dividends, gives charity cash to the homeless, reads your mind and delivers your shipment to you by drone within the hour; bitcoin's network effect trumps all of that too. 
I'm only mentioning all of this because I like the look of your project and it's a shame for you guys to not get the credit of making the system that we'll be using in the future. At the very least, look into a way to make FLO optional before it's too late.

Let's also put aside the fact that this would require the bitcoin network to handle over 1 million transactions per second... Today the network slows down around 5-8 TPS, so 1 million isn't even in the cards during the next decade without some miracle breakthrough. 
But if it could handle them all, the hyperbitcoinization effect from that scenario would be so strong that the idea of fiat currency would quickly lose its very meaning.
There is no reason to imagine *any* existing currency would be useful anymore. Sure, governments could easily require their taxes be paid in the currency they issue, but since literally everything else on the planet is bought and sold for bitcoins, then people would see that as a once-per-year coupon that they have to purchase for a single use. They'd never buy more of that inconvenient, value-leaking fiat than they need to pay their taxes with that year.
So meanwhile, 7.5 Billion people would all need as much bitcoin as they have fiat now. (More actually, the amount of wealth created by universal, borderless innovation would make everyone richer than we are today, most especially the the poorer 2/3rds of the world who are plagued by bad banking infrastructure and no good access to money or loans.
So, if the M1 of the world is currently somewhere above 30 Trillion USD ( then you simply divide that $30t into the existing number of bitcoins that are accessible, a number near 16 million... A value somewhere near $1,875,000 per bitcoin... Of course dollars won't be worth very much by then so more like 100's of trillions of dollars each.  
For us to all get an equal share of the bitcoins (and the total world wealth) we'd need to stack a whopping 0.00213333 btc. 
Of course this doesn't take into account the value in things like Real estate, gold, and other stores of value, just currencies. Gold could very well lose it's usefulness and value too soon adding another 9 trillion to the pile.

Um, I'm speaking from experience, I was a bitpay customer for a long time until BIP70 made it impossible to continue.
Although Bitpay has no way to "demand" that you set your fee to any amount, you should try using it sometime... They absolutely do penalize you for not placing enough fee on the TX, and worse yet, the minimum fee they want you to set is literally larger than the largest fee selection inside the bitcoin core wallet! The last time I did that funky 8-step hop to pay their invoice, I made sure to pay the highest fee possible inside bitcoinqt without computing the sats per byte, but Bitpay still gave me an error on sending it, and I had to wait for an email 20 minutes later to even know if the transaction went through.
Meanwhile, their process is filled with about a dozen scary messages telling people how high bitcoin's fees got last year and how users should now expect to wait up to 48 hours for their transaction to go through! They are clearly trying to scare people away from using BTC.
As for your wallet selections, I see you only seem to respect the lowest common denominator; You only seem to care if the largest services use BIP70 but had  very little regard for the best &amp; most advanced wallets out there, most obviously Samourai. EVERYONE should be using samourai but I guess the public just doesn't care about their privacy, once again. Still, why should we want to use a service that doesn't interface with the best wallet we have?

There are all kinds of uses, but yours is certainly one of the top 3.
A store of value like that was ***not*** "always capable before currency existed" simply because we've had currency since cowrie shells and earlier attempts, none of which were even durable enough to last a generation.
The first long-term store of value on record was gold and silver (electrum) rings and shavings. Those immediately became the best form of money in each location they existed.
Money needs to be based off of a store of value, otherwise what you're trading with people has no value, and why on earth would they accept your useless thing for their goods?
Bitcoin is NOT innovative because it's a better payment system. It's only innovative because it's a better currency with the best store of value ever made.

I'm quite convinced that Faketoshi and all others claiming to be Satoshi are going to be picked up by mafias and governments in the future who simply see it as a smart business decision to torchure these people to death on the off-chance they are the real satoshi and have a few trillion bucks worth of private keys lying around.

Because their product is their sanctioned unit of currency... Which is in direct competition with bitcoin if it keeps growing.
They have to realize, maybe even just on an internal, nervously-laughing level, that if bitcoin takes off and goes mainstream, then US dollars and frankly all other currencies will be used less and less until we simply have no use for banks.
Clearly they are hoping that having their own blockchain will help them make their own service offering cheaper in the meantime, so people will have less of a need than ever to even consider using bitcoin.
It's a simple competition, and they're destined to lose.

Wow you're thick.
The ones paying the energy costs are happy to do so. Who are you to tell them they are wrong or evil? You are basically making an argument against free trade and property rights here.
"the entire world banking and finance system uses the same or less"
This is absolutely insane. You fail at life in general being this incredibly wrong.
Denmark is tiny. Less than 6 million people live there and across all of it's islands, including greenland. That's several millions of people smaller than New york City's population... Just the city, not the state, mind you.
Meanwhile, go to any big city and see how many of the skyscrapers have a bank's name at the top of them. In Seoul they are every third skyscraper; You can see two different skyscrapers with the same bank's name at the top from many different major intersections there. Tokyo's not that much better.
Then there are so many other uses for electricity that fiat requires, not just office buildings and bank branches, but the networking between them, the vehicles they use, including armored cars, the ATM machines, the payment networks from swift all the way down to paypal and venmo, and the governance structure that is closely tied in with governments such as the central banks, IMF, BIS, etc.
Now, how many industries exist to support those industries? The makers of those ATM machines, Armored cars, construction companies, bank vaults, armed guard agencies, makers of their armor and weaponry, etc... All of those use electricity too, you know. Now were talking about a very sizable portion of each city's economy and business.
Then there is the cost of human LIVES that banks incur every year if you really want to keep defending their waste. How many security guards and bankinng employees lose their lives each year just defending or being near the existing financial system's stores of value? Innocent customers lose lives too just being present for robberies.
Bitcoin moves all of the security of the whole monetary system out of centralized places like banks to the cloud. People can be individually targeted still, but they are now too, as well. This is a definite improvement that makes anyone defending the banking system an extremely evil person IMHO. (As if inflation wasn't evil enough.)

You don't seem to know the point of a store of value though. Bitcoin has huge volatility, but that's mainly because of the big spikes in user growth it's had... Six huge, 10x+ spikes over a decade, and not a single one of them have fallen back to pre-spike price levels.
A store of value is good when it has low volatility.
A store of value is BETTER when it has continually positive growth.
With a long enough time horizon, (2+ years?) bitcoin is proven to have the latter.
People who don't use bitcoin as a store of value are some of the biggest losers of our age.

Definitions are universal when agreed on by all parties. Clearly the capitalists and communists don't agree on this one.
Your definition uses the word "controlled" which is, again, offensive. It describes biz owners and CEOs having some kind of legal monopoly over the whole economy and therefore everyone's lives. 
In reality, trade is a natural thing that man does without even being told how, like eating, speaking, or loving. To control it is to be an evil tyrant or worse. 
Ancaps certainly believe in private property... It is indeed a central tenet. What you haven't heard yet apparently is that the two are completely unseperable. Free trade is something you can only do if you truly own your stuff to trade with. Conversely, you can only truly own stuff if you either inherited it, homesteaded it, or traded for it freely. Since the first two ways are pretty rare occurrences, free trade is absolutely vital to private property and vice versa. Existentially vital, in fact. 
Trying to separate free trade from private property is to not understand what those things are.

Shame, you missed the part that you need to understand the most.
To imagine that the devs are even capable of "discussing anything with the users and get an opinion" is to be oblivious to what the devs are.
The devs exist as hundreds of individuals with no organizational structure, no leader, no followers, and no speaker. They don't have a way to officially poll for the opinion. They are against the very idea of it. They also don't have a way to communicate their findings... The bitcoin.org website sometimes does when it's something really important like the segwit2x warning, but that's just Theymos and Cobra doing it independently.
They also don't have a way to 'force their beliefs' on anyone through censorship, but it could be argued that Theymos does. He also hasn't written any code in a long time and has no way to force his beliefs on the others.

You'll get 10 different answers for that around here, because there are ten or more problems with the way it is being done today.
If you asked each and every bitcoin holder if they'd like to magically have a new 2 megabyte base blocksize (meaning that after segwit it's technically possible to have a rare 8mb block size) and there be no consequences or chance of a chainsplit, then maybe 0.0001% of us (or just Luke-jr) would say no to doing it.
But that's just a naive, strawman of a thing to hope for. The way it gets deployed makes all the difference, and we'd be sure to still have a contentious fork like the one we're facing now unless we truly take the time to do it right, such as a Dev-led 1 year upgrade process that entails a few version upgrades leading up to it.  
Plus, if we do fill that up and are constantly seeing 6-8mb blocks from that simple upgrade, we're going to have a huge Node count drop-off, greatly harming decentralization as far fewer people will choose to pay that much money to keep running full nodes.

In a nutshell, big banks and corps, from Coinbase up to Google and JP Morgan, are about to have a regulated environment where their in-house investors can hedge the volatility of bitcoin against actual bitcoin, not just some cash equivalent that is inefficient like has been tried before.
This should allow for many new big corps to accept bitcoin because it's now not as risky for them; they can efficiently hedge it on a grand scale.

Bitcoin exists on a free market and the vast majority of the world is not yet invested in it.
These parabolic surges followed by \~70% declines are simply what new user adoption looks like under a free market. It's not that we celebrate the 70% fall, more like celebrating the other 30% which never fails to stick around afterwards as we've adopted more believers.
I don't think it could ever happen, but I guarantee you that if bitcoin's price were to fall more than \~70% after such a surge, absolutely no one would be celebrating anymore. We'd finally have reason to doubt that bitcoin is being adopted steadily.

Value is in the eye of the beholder.
* International Businessfolk and remittance senders will fully agree with this, it reducing the financial infrastructure costs of international trade &amp; remittance.
* People who live in distressed regimes like Venezuela or Iran have a completely different idea of why bitcoin is valuable. Many would argue that their use case is far more compelling and important, even.
* Some developers and entrepreneurs need Micropayments. LN will be something that they will see the most value of all in.
* All of us Bitcoin Maximalists see it as the hardest form of money, a.k.a. a kickass store of value.  This is the most valuable feature of bitcoin for me.
* Cryptoanarchists see it as the best way to achieve their political goals, a once-in-a-millenium weapon to remove power from the state and put it back in the hands of the little guy. That's clearly the most valuable thing for them.
Are any of these really more important than the others? Not really in any measurable way. Some overlap, some haven't really arrived yet, etc. If you measure by a simple headcount, the tally changes the order of its categories over time, even year by year.
Face it; they're all damn important features and Bitcoin is the first to bring them all to the world. Instead of claiming what "the true value" of it is, why not just be happy that it's truly valuable to so many different people in different walks of life?

Quick questions before I can invest any more time reading about Alexandria:
1. Is there a way to use it, both publishing and consuming, without ever touching an altcoin? (Bitcoin only)
2. Is there a way to publish your content on Alexandria that requires payment at a price you set, and then excludes others from simply using a re-published magnet link to download the torrent once paid for?
3. Can all of it be used without any human identification in any way? (Can you simply add funds via bitcoin and your account name can be a throw-away?)

His point hinged on this supposition:


All of us bitcoin "chemists" (Hodlers) are in it because we have good reason to believe that it will keep appreciating at roughly 5x per year like it has so far to date. We see no reason why it would stop before the price of bitcoin is $1m each or way higher. That's chemistry.
We chemists number in the tens of thousands, if not millions. That's why we're not selling; even if we're a little wrong, we're clearly a self-fulfilling prophecy.

LOL... I guess someone isn't keeping up on actual bitcoin history:
"The first argument everyone makes is that miners would switch pools if any pool started censoring transactions. This may be true, but to keep an objective measure of security we must assume they would only switch if it were profitable to do so."
So I guess Daniel missed that whole thing a year ago when Ghash actually went up to 50%, and everyone bailed against profitability?

It's a good trick to know, but for the sake of making LN completely useful and usable in everyday transactions, we must consider the path of the refill from source to destination, and how to do it over and over even with future paychecks you haven't earned yet.
If I'm not mistaken, me re-filling that channel with money I don't yet possess is still going to cause future bitcoin blockchain TXs, right? I'd need to either get my dollars or my Bitcoin to someone like that merchant that will sent me LBTC in return, no matter if they already have a channel open with me or not. The first half of that trade involves a Bitcoin TX, doesn't it? I'd love to be wrong on this point.

Secondly, Tyson's Hollywood career has been taking off since the Hangover series... Check it out on IMDB; he's got 30 acting credits, some of them pretty good.

Hi Ryan, thank you very much for the Feedback. I'm making a few changes based on your suggestions and I hope you'll find the rest is not as disappointing as first glance suggested.


I'm sorry, I'm interpreting the data very differently. I understand completely what blockstack is and that anyone can create a GUI to register and resolve names for Onename... But they have not done so yet, unfortunately. Nor do I see a reason for them to with Onename.com being a website that is easy to remember. 
In contrast, BitAlias has no data store outside of the blockchain, and simply needs a couple of bitcoin spends to use its' protocol. Clearly it is more decentralized, at least for now, until we see the finished BitAlias interface.


I cannot judge code that does not exist. The protocol, however, is plainly stated on their website... Just a system of spends to the bitcoin blockchain with certain things put in the OP_RETURN field... Two spends to register, one spend to transfer. Even just another spend to vote for fee changes... Super-simple. There is no code to be made in such a system to do the function of the Onename website nor the DHT that Blockstore uses... BitAlias is simply decentralized on a more basic level than the alternatives, so Malahov would REALLY have to drop the ball at this point to make the rest of his coding centralized somehow.


Point taken, thank you. I'll be ripping out the reference to Linux shortly.


I'm sorry, but the Blockstore website on Github makes no reference to using proof of burn whatsoever and even says in their FAQs section at several points that "Fees paid to register names go to miners instead of being burned or essentially wasted. This incentivizes mining and increases the overall security of the network."
I can't change the article to reflect any more recent changes until those references are taken out of their website.


Onename is paying the fee themselves, so I guess it is scarce to them... However to the user, it's free. 
Any marketplace built around Onename IDs would have to factor in an infinite, free supply of more names... Heck, is there a point in such a marketplace? I doubt it, but I may be surprised. I realize that this is an Economic reason, not a technical one, but I'm simply not convinced that Onename names are scarce enough to build a Sedo-like marketplace around.
Thanks again for your feedback! I'm sending edits to my editor now.

Impatient youth.
Bitcoin as a payment mechanism has an Ace up its' sleeve that ensures it cannot fail to be the dominant payment system one day. You're just looking at its' growth on a Gnat's timeline, when no one ever said it would take less than decades.
The Ace: The currency bitcoin will survive all the hyperinflation events that are about to happen from government spending around the world. It's already way too late for them to avoid their consequences. Bitcoin is the only useful 'payment system' left when the dollar, euro, and yen are all toilet paper.
Having a money independent from the state is important. Just because the everyday shmo on the street doesn't know that yet doesn't mean he won't find out soon the hard way.

Planet bitcoin seems to have two indigenous species within it... Those who see the full power of the blockchain and those who are just hoping for a better paypal &amp;/or hoping to make some quick cash when the price shoots up again.
The former group can't be happy about this, because it adds more regulation to bitcoin than any other security has to put up with... At the same time, however, we know that all of these regulations are impossible to enforce on bitcoin, so it's kind of Melancholy to this group.
The latter group IS happy about this news, because they are so desperate for any kind of acceptance from the state that they lose all common sense. To these fools, any time the govt says something about Bitcoin that doesn't include the words "terrorism," "Money Laundering," or "Drugs" then they imagine the price is about to go up in response and start high-fiveing each other immediately. 
It's hard to say how many of each we have... But Satoshi was clearly the former so hopefully all of the latter realize they are unwelcome here and either wise up or piss off.

You make it sound like it takes legitimate fraud, which would be a one in a million situation.
Banks block wires ALL THE TIME, millions of times daily, on SUSPICION alone, usually finding nothing at all wrong.
Paypal, of course, does it 10x more than that again, locking up money for 6 months at a time without so much as an explanation.
And don't get me started on all of the political censorship banks do like blocking wikileaks funding, and of course banks that close down bitcoiners' accounts!

Bitcoin's network effects is the most correct answer. Most people know of and accept bitcoin, and lightning is the way to use bitcoin in the most useful way there.
I can think of dozens of other reasons, too. Security should be important to people with so much to lose. Bitcoin's security is light years beyond any other coin.
Censorship resistance, too, will be very attractive to Venezuelans. Would you like to try to argue that some other crapcoin has better censorship resistance than Bitcoin? I thought not.
Heck, they can make money on their open channels so it might actually be profitable for some of them in the right circumstances.

Earning your salary in bitcoins is the hardest part, but it's exactly the same problem everywhere in the world. If you've got that taken care of, the rest of the problem is which CITY to live in that has the densest concentration of merchants who accept btc.
If you're willing to go the gift card route, then any moderately big city in the USSA is great for using Gyft and its' competitors... Although gas and groceries can be a bit spartan.
If you get your hands on a Xapo card or similar service that stores btc for you while letting you spend fiat, then you're in even better shape, although it doesn't do that much to help the bitcoin economy grow. -The idea is to reward those accepting bitcoin with your business, not make them irrelevant.
So if you're a purest like me, Look to the cities with the highest adoption rates, starting with Buenos Ares, London, Madrid, San Fran, NYC, (yeach) Tel Aviv,  Singapore, and perhaps Bali. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 23:57:42
It scales.
Right now the computation power of sending, receiving, and recording status messages from every toaster, dishwasher, fridge and thermostat in the world is literally beyond any hope for our computer networks to handle. WAY off the charts. Just the IP address routing alone would make IPv6 obsolete overnight!
Not the bitcoin blockchain though... If each of these devices gave their status reports and update requests and etc. as bitcoin transactions, or at least the transaction on a sidechain linked to bitcoin, then scaling is no problem anymore... Because the bitcoin mining network is the most powerful such network man has ever conceived.
Both IBM and Samsung have already invested into this exact usage. Of course it will take a solution to the 7 TPS problem, and I think Sidechains will do the trick.

Do you imagine that once 90% flees (It's actually around 80% with F2Pool) that somehow their servers are going to magically be stuck with the new decision forever, so once they find the other chain unprofitable they cannot come back?
What's going to happen if the majority of miners flees bitcoin to the BTC1 fork is that our blocks will slow down to 10% or 20% of their normal speed, fees will go way up because there is less room to fit TXs in each remaining block, and bitcoin will STILL be more profitable to mine. 
Miners won't be able to survive on that other coin for long. Bitcoin has the vast majority of the people on it and will pay more money, right up front. They'll be back in hours, flat.

The word capitalism is fascinating that it means such different things to different people. Your definition of it sounds nearly exactly like our definition for Cronyism, which we feel is something Bitcoin was built to help put an end to by defunding the state.
We ancaps feel that capitalism can't exist without anarchy, and anarchy can't exist without capitalism, which we define as nothing more than unrestricted trade between anyone and everyone. The natural state of man.
The more you try to re-assign our favorite and most beloved concept to sound like something we fight against, the more you stand out as an enemy to us, who as you noted, make up a large &amp; of the Bitcoin hodlers.
I mean seriously, this action is HIGHLY offensive, like telling an african american that you only refer to them as klansmen.
I get it though; you were brought up to use the word for an entirely different thing. I try not to let the use of such an offensive turn of phrase cloud my judgement. I hope you can do the same when we put down communism, which we are taught to mean the absolute opposite of the natural state of man, where centralized power completely steals everything you hold dear, including your very life oftentimes.
I'm sure that's not your definition, but damn, you have to admit that all attempts at reaching state communism has resulted in this or worse.

Lol... You realize we started off with 50 bitcoins per block right? Same block interval. 7200 coins daily for years, and those were the years that bitcoin went from $0.0025 to over $10. 
Then for 4 years we had 25 per block, which lasted all throughout the 2014 massive depression.  Even THEN we didn't have too much issuance to have the effect you are describing.
This 12.5 block reward is only half as inflationary as that was.... Meanwhile users are flocking to bitcoin at much faster a rate than twice what they used to.
It's new users buying into bitcoin that offsets the inflation, which is pitiful by comparison. Coinbase alone (NOT the biggest bitcoin seller by far) signs up so many people every single day it's amazing the price doesn't 10x every week.

Your understanding of the two 'teams' involved today is exactly backwards.
What you think of as "core" is a decentralized, leaderless, open source project that everyone in the world is free to contribute to, including you. 475 people have contributed to it, and there literally is no one calling the shots saying what goes in bitcoin and what doesn't. It's total anarchy, but it's in the form of a meritocracy where the best ideas float to the top and become bitcoin, no matter who submitted them. Even Anonymous people get their code made into bitcoin, like ShaolinFry's BIP 91. -It only happens though when many other devs think it's a really good idea and help make it happen in a responsible, well-tested way.
What you're suggesting is an idea that cannot survive in that environment. Basically, you are imagining politics or even a dictatorship where the development community is, and that somehow all those devs would work together to add inflation, which destroys bitcoin's scarcity... As if they weren't some of the biggest Hodlers among us that have for years now fiercely protected bitcoin's scarcity. It's the only sane course of action as a bitcoin dev.
What you perceive as everyone 'blindly following' the devs is actually us rightfully following the same thing that they follow... Protecting our investment.

This is actually much worse than a 51% attack. In a 51A, you can really only steal from targeted addresses that you mine, and only then if you can hold the lead for so long that it can't be undone. That's really a theft of money against selected bitcoin holders... 
With Segwit2x, it's not about stealing money at all. It's about making bitcoin work differently than it did before... Getting a new protocol in there so bitcoin works in favor of different people. 
That means that if this coup is successful, then a proven way to change bitcoin's 21m limit or any other rule has been demonstrated. We should all expect it's only a matter of time until something like a govt comes along and does that, perhaps to force KYC rules into the code or simply to destroy it.

I think you'll find the rules of attacking a decentralized enemy are unfathomably different than attacking all enemies to date. Very different and very simple... Because there is no capital to capture, or any other central point of failure, all strategies to date ever employed by any military are right out.
Instead, they'd have to literally target every single anarchist individually, fight us one at a time since there is no centralization of power to target. 
That's a nightmare attack plan that makes attacking anarchist lands a nightmare, usually not worth anyones' effort.
But let's pretend they tried anyway. How many attack tanks/planes/ships do they have? surely not as many as the population of another country?
To defend against such an advance, anarchists would simply use their numbers to their advantage and add a small, automated defense turret of some kinds to their property... Something that would protect them from burglars as well as invading troops.
Of course economically it's not feasible for a standard homeowner to own automated hardware that can take out a tank or bomber, but if something like a machine gun is strapped to the roof of every home, it totally defeats the attack plans of any invader because individual targets aren't worth sending a tank or dropping a bomb, while meanwhile, ground troops would be absolutely wiped out before long trying to make their way through neighboorhoods of these installations.

Gox had very few free market alternatives; basically NONE for the largest group of consumers in north america.
Did Gox hold onto that spot because their service and support were so fantastic that no one would use the alternatives? No? then that's a dead giveaway that limitations to the marketplace stopped free choice of competitors from forming, no matter if you saw those limitations or not.
In Gox's case, in retrospect, we know that the banking relationships that a large exchange needs were turned down pretty much everywhere else back then. Today is a different story, but in 2013 exchange startups had to really know a banker very well (and have pics of them cheating on their wife to blackmail them with) in order to get the fiat side of the exchange covered. Very unfree.
This is not to say that there is no problem with information propagation. Bitcoin as a community is so varied and decentralized itself that we have groups of people getting all of their knowledge about it from sources that other groups have never heard of... Naturally a message like "gox isn't safe" doesn't propagate fully.
It's a shame, one that I wish more ppl would work on. It's a big reason I'm a journalist now.
A huge example of this is 3rd-party wallets like Gem and BitGo. -Almost no one is using them, but they are simply the safest way to store coins at an exchange... 100% UnGoxxable. -Yet only expresscoin and a few other small exchanges use them.

Those are just the tip of the tip of the tip of the 3rd iceberg over as far bitcoin's uses. They're the 'low hanging fruit' for the media to make a story out of; not the usual, day to day boring uses. 
A lot of people have approached bitcoin over the last 9 years with your level of skepticism. You wouldn't be the first to read up a bit more and then come to realize what really gives it value and why that grows constantly.
I highly recommend you start reading here in Lopp's beginner section:
  
Start in the upper left hand corner with that ELI5 article and then read Satoshi's whitepaper. You can skip all the math if you want, it still makes sense. 
After that, read whatever else is on Lopp's page that looks like it will answer the questions you have. For anything else, just ask here on reddit.

I was in that position once. I 1st bought in during 2011. I can't remember how many I had in total but before cyprus I sold them all for a 10-15x gain. I was happy at first....
Then the cyprus bubble happened in spring 2013 and I saw how fast it could go 100x. At that point it was way too expensive to buy back in... And for the most part, I never did!
...But I started trading my work for BTC that year instead. Now I've got enough already to be happy with, not like before, but it's certainly better than nothing. Earning BTC is definitely a way to get back without all the regret.

Well, there's a huge difference between people who were already rich in 2011 like Roger was and people who were poor at the time. We both believed in it just as much but many of us couldn't afford to grab 1,000 coins then, even at $5. 
The worst part is though, the few handfuls I was able to grab, I happily spent thanks to Roger's oft advice... Sure, I "replaced" them, but since the price went up in the meantime, I couldn't afford to buy back as many as I spent... And have far fewer coins today than I would have if I'd just hodled my 2011 coins.

That is developer Luke-jr's node counter... The difference is that his includes nodes that are considered "not listening," which means they aren't donating their bandwidth to the network by allowing lots of incoming connections. They do allow up to 8 connections each though, so it's not like they are outside of the web. 
Everyone installing a node makes a non-listening node by default, and would have to add a line to the config file of bitcoinqt that tells it to start listening before it would show up in any of those counters like bitnodes and coindance. You can test it yourself, as I have.

But your debt to the credit card company isn't what buys you anything with their card... Their money buys you the thing, and your money pays them back later. Debt is just a time shifting of your money, not a separate kind of money.
All money is a ledger. Every cowrie shell, fiat note, altcoin and gold bar in history was just someone's way of keeping track of who has earned how much value.

Close, but not quite right either.
Both fiat and those numbers on a blockchain represent VALUE. (i.e. the goods and services we can purchase with them later.)
Fiat's just a worse way of accounting for that value. It's much more prone to theft through inflation and all kinds of censorship than bitcoin is.
People get too hung up on the whole debt issue, but that's only important when you're talking about how secure the issuing country is from collapsing. Otherwise, debt or no debt, money like fiat and bitcoin both just store our future stuff in a very convenient format for us until redeemed.

How about provably decentralizing with Pseudonymous noses?
What if every miner were ID'd properly and fairly somehow, but that ID is something like an OpenID or Namecoin ID,  which may or may not be tied back to your IRL identity?
One step further: What if we made MinerCoin that was an asset that works like a Taxi cab Medallion. You have to have one to mine bitcoin, you prove you still own it by Merge-Mining it with bitcoin, and it keeps up with your ongoing hashrate if needed by storing the latest hashrate on its' blockchain, which would be pretty damn secure if mergemined.
That coin would be both the ticket to mine and your identity as a miner, and everyone would see if it moves, goes offline, and what its' hashrate is constantly... Not sure if that solves the whole problem though.

Bandwidth isn't a problem; availability is. You don't need high throughput (after your initial chain is downloaded) you just need it to be on all the time with great pingtimes.
Ideal is considered less than 300 ms pingtimes, over 1200 ms aren't good enough to even count at 
Here's a set of (not too fresh) directions for doing it the from scratch:  
And here's the 'official' help page on it:  
The most common build I know if is Bitcore:   -Made by some very trustworthy developers at Bitpay, including Ryan X Charles. (Now at Yours)
There are a few other newer flavors now, too. 
As for how to contribute to the network; that's easy. 
1) Run a full node &amp; get your pingtimes down.
2) Convince businesses that they should run a full node if for no other reason than to have a local copy of the blockchain for accounting's sake.
Hope that helps!

There is this thing called Divisibility. Bitcoin's really good at it.
The dollar has 100 pennies, and you can't go any further down than that, so if the dollar were to suddenly have a reduced supply (as if!) you could no longer buy things that cost 1 penny except in bulk.
Meanwhile, bitcoin has 100 Million satoshis. We'll be just fine if you reduce the supply down to something like 100 bitcoins. Maybe even just 1 bitcoin... And even then, the devs can decide to make that one bitcoin divide up into another 100 million ways if they want.

No, we're not. That's not how the market works... You don't have to account for the dollars in circulation to know that a loaf of bread is worth $2. It's worth two bucks because that's what we're willing to pay for it, and we're willing to pay that much for it today because we're paid at a certain rate, and we're paid at a certain rate because our bosses can afford to pay us that much, and they can afford to pay that much because they can sell their product for so much, etc etc all the way up to the fed printing money by the truckfull... You can't account for that all the way down from fed to bread.

People like you and Dimon don't seem to realize that bitcoin works great... in fact BETTER... when you take the fiat out of the mix.
America is in no danger of going first, but there will be countries FULL of people who will gladly start accepting bitcoin for their goods and services, using it ONLY instead of the existing fiat.
Doing so makes legal retaliation extremely difficult, since no one is able to track them. Without buying bitcoins on a KYC-reporting exchange like coinbase, they're totally anonymous, and their taxes simply won't reflect all that activity.
It's easy to say this will happen because so many economies around the world are majority-cash, where most people aren't allowed to open a bank account because they make too little.
Once they see others doing so, this is a no-brainer with almost no downside for that 1-2 Billion people around the world.
And hey, once Billions are using it that way, the price will literally be more stable than the USD's is, and things will start getting priced in bitcoin, globally.
Then it'll be irresistible. Why would vendors even want to use other currencies at that point? People will demand that their govts make it legal.

James, Anonymity is a double-edged sword.
Yes, Govts like China's can swoop in and steal rigs from miners who are anonymous.

Neither solution is perfect; there needs to be a decentralized identity mining most of the network for that.

I've also seen much from Maduro promoting and normalizing other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, within VEN too... Laws passed, Exchanges encouraged, classes given, seminars, youth groups formed, etc... A major, major public education push designed to get the public aware and accepting cryptocurrencies.
I'm sure the moron thinks he's doing this to raise acceptance for the Petro, but the end result is unavoidable; the petro is quantifiably worse than the bolivar, as outrageous as that sounds, so no one will want to hold it. Meanwhile, they'll all be allowed to buy and hold bitcoin.
Venezuela is EXTREMELY well primed to become the first country to have its currencie(s) devoured by bitcoin. (Hyperbitcoinization) Polls have shown that the majority of the country now knows what cryptocurrencies are and a sizable percentage think positively of them already... More than anywhere else in the world except maybe japan.
My guess is that the Petro is a non-starter (for technical reasons, not just the lack of trust in Maduro) and the Bolivar's slide will accellerate this year, leaving Bitcoin as the best option for anyone who can't get their hands on Dollars there. (And the US embargo on exactly that is only getting stronger.)
So hopefully, within 1-2 years, especially as new,  lightning-enabled wallets proliferate and make cheap, reliable crypto transactions a reality for them, Bitcoin will take off like a rocket, replacing dollars and of course the bolivar in daily use, nationwide. 
Read Daniel Krawicz' Hyperbitcoinization article from 2014 to see how long that replacement will take.

The way I see it, we're going to be swamped by Altcoins running lightning network and cross-chain swapping each other in 2-3 months. All alts will act like one giant economic competitor to Bitcoin by that time, and probably be well above the 50% threshold on the cryptocoin dominance index by then.
So if we can't pull it off by the end of summer-ish, Bitcoin's only hope will be that the miners give in first and load Segwit by themselves.
1 year out is a bit late, we'll be the 2nd or 3rd biggest altcoin by then.

It's really sad, he actually does believe this, wholeheartedly. Everyone who works with him swears this.
The problem is a fascinating one. It all began in 2014 when Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, both in love with the idea of bigger block sizes, had a falling out with the rest of the bitcoin dev community. Roger was invested in Gavin at the foundation, perhaps elsewhere too if I remember correctly. Despite Roger being an anarchist and Gavin being a statist, Roger accepted Gavin's views on scaling at face value, and took their side when the devs started fighting over scaling.
All of this is only possible because Roger misunderstands one key point in Austrian Economic theory, which he loves to quote wrong. In Menger's regression theorem, which is what Austrians point to as the explanation for how money comes to exist, Roger thinks it says that Money has to be a transactional network first before it can be a store of value... Which is exactly backwards. Read it for yourself: (second to last paragraph)
Sadly, no one has been able to rub roger's nose in this fact; his mind is too invested now in the opposite being true. He squirms out of it and simply shouts the opposite over his debate partners every time it's brought up. 
If he could only accept this point he'd know that Bitcoin's property of being a store of value (digital gold, settlement layer) is far more important than it being just another paypal competitor. The first one is what Devs have been protecting all the while knowing that the latter can be lost and refound... The store of value will be lost forever once gone.

Step 1. Research in google all the variations on your product/service's keywords. Do it until your fingers bleed. Others have either done it, come close, or can't do it because it's not a workable business. Know the difference.
Step 2. Nail down the right team. This can't be understated. If you don't have the people with the skills in place already to make this happen, no amount of presentations and great ideas will land you funding.
Step 3. Ask Barry for some coins.  He used to hand them out left and right, and probably still does for the right idea, but the venture capital crypto market has dried up for the most part late last year. A few other VCs like Pantera and Draper do this as well.  
Step 4. Failing obtaining Barrymoney, plan your own ICO or Kickstarter campaign to raise funds yourself. Depending on your business this might be a better fit for you than VC funds. There are several places now for helping launch such fundraisers, like Bank2theFuture: 
Good luck!

The reason to use it over a BTM is that BTM's aren't very common yet and some charge huge fees. 
Most people use it to buy or sell coins online with paypal or a bank account, but you can use it to buy in person with cash too, making a completely anonymous trade.
Like Zenkz said, selling is more risky because the cost to become a normal-looking buyer is low. However, it's easy to get ripped off buying too, if you get tempted to buy coins from sellers who aren't highly-rated... They'll offer you a lower rate, and sometimes they look perfect otherwise and do the "I'm new just building my rep" song and dance. -Then they do a charge back the next day and you owe paypal hundreds... Tricky little loophole they have, but avoidable if your seller has thousands of sales all rated highly.

1. There is no stock price, it's bitcoin's price, which is more like a gold coin than a stock.
2. Your investment's value is measured in dollars, but the amount of bitcoin you have stays the same. 7 years ago, 10,000 bitcoins could buy a $20 pizza. Today, you can buy several Pizza chains with 10,000 bitcoins.
3. It stayed at 0.001... If you have more or less than that in your wallet now, then someone most certainly sent you more or you sent some out. There is no other explanation.

1. Just like Gold and all other natural money man has chosen, Bitcoin has to become a valued asset in use by many before we can use it as a currency to price items in. As it becomes ubiquitous, the volatility sinks and when everyone is holding their 0.0026 btc share of all bitcoins, it'll have a far more stable price than the dollar or any other currency in earth's history. -So just treat it as gold for now, currency comes later.
2. All good money is scarce. There are only 21m possible coins for 8 billion people, making bitcoin far more scarce than things like gold, while at the same time being a far more useful way to hold and transfer value online. (If you haven't noticed, people like using the internet, so it's no surprise we'd want to buy stuff here) So what we're seeing is the effect of new people getting into bitcoin, plain and simple. They'll keep doing that until everyone's got some... So expect prices to rise consistently, but in waves, for decades.
3. The BTC structure that satoshi designed as is, is far too limited to scale to global transaction throughputs. We top out a 3.3 transactions per second (tps) so reaching the global volumes of 1 million tps that the other networks are currently doing isn't an option without some massive, massive expansions.

Buying it has two downsides. First, it's not helping close the loop. If we can't close the full loop then Fiat's place as the dominant currency is always secure.

You can argue all you want to about how much a few causality-challenged morons want the HF, no dev and certainly not the economic majority are going to give into that demand... To do so is tanamount to selling all our coins and running to litecoin because we believe it could kill bitcoin.

More disingenuity. 2/3rds of the planet are not ALLOWED to have bank accounts. Meanwhille, 6 of the 7 billion people on this rock have internet-attached phones today. That's all you need to use bitcoin, because any software needed is free and open source.  
If your only argument is "well they haven't heard of it yet" then I'd agree with you, but point out all the people working hard to make them aware of it, like Roger. He's not alone, you know.


No, it doesn't at all. Many bitcoiners generally do not buy coins anymore, opting to earn them for our goods and services. They just work for them instead of for fiat; it makes life a lot easier.
Meanwhile, even if you want to buy them, sites like Paxful and LocalBitcoins allow you to do so in dozens of different ways that don't need a bank account.

When Binney did his escape in 2001, he had little fear that his gov would slap him in a prison cell for the rest of his life. Those were the times, the us gov still at least attempted to appear like they weren't using the constitution for toilet paper yet.
He wasn't in 1/100,000th as much danger as Snowden put himself in, and with all of his planning and experience snowden still got close to being caught in HK.

The Economist is not just some waiting room magazine. It is, by far, the print paper of all finance print papers. Think "Stodgy" &amp; multiply it by "Authority," and you've got something that every financier and economist would want their boss to subscribe too.
With over 1.5 million average weekly circulation, half of which is sold in the U.S., This old-school publisher has 11 million twitter followers on top of pretty much every decision maker at the top level of financial institutions, worldwide.
Bitcoin and to a greater extent, the blockchain, have just reached the pinnacle of authority in print.

They earn it, just like they would their local money. M-Pesa proved that it's doable and nowadays more Kenyans earn M-Pesa in their mobile accounts than they do the local currency.


You'd be very, very surprised. Well over 90% of africans have a mobile account now, and in Kenya and Nigeria, two of the largest populations, nearly everyone has a smartphone... They've leapfrogged the US, in fact.
India's Jia Smartphone costs about $4. They're far more popular there than Apple is here.
There are now LENDING solutions to all of these people in bitcoin that isn't going to exist through traditional payment channels due to practical limits.


It's easy to imagine that the benefits of bitcoin are based in the growth in it's value, but these people aren't looking for an investment... They're looking for a job.  (And if they don't want a job then they're either sick and need help, or scum and need to suffer.)
Bitcoin doesn't just help these folks by being an alternative payment method... It helps them gain lines of credit to start the business of their choice in the first place. It helps them gain opportunities and means of making payments that they cannot access otherwise.
Through apps like OpenBazaar, it gives people who normally have exposure to a potential of 100-1000 customers their own global storefront. It basically solves every problem that governments and even geography throw in their way.

I'm suggesting that we shouldn't stop miners from being anonymous if they're able to. What if one has a kickass TOR connection, like that new HORNET network I keep hearing about? Regardless of the implementation, the tech could theoretically be there one day to hide miners very well and it may come down to those guys to keep the network safe from attack.
Having seen your cardboard box vids, I know exactly what you mean by needing the transparency too... In theory I agree, but in practice I feel govts are likely to find the ID'd miners a wonderful treat.

"The list of nominees is kept secret for 50 years. But thousands of people are eligible to nominate candidates – including former laureates, members of parliament and government around the world, some university professors and members of certain international organisations – and they can disclose the names they have put forward." 
Sauce: 
-As in the case of Malala Yousafzai whose nomination was disclosed and she actually went on to win a Nobel Peace Prize 
Also Snowden's nomination was also disclosed, and no, that didn't disqualify him.

To all the 'Blockstream Core' conspiracy theorists on this thread:
If you had one shred of decency, you'd investigate the following, easily proven or disproven points for yourself:
1. Blockstream isn't even the company with the most bitcoin devs. 100% of Chaincode's devs are Bitcoin core devs: 
2. The 'corporate money' that blockstream accepted, AXA, is just a French investment bank, not goldman sachs. There was no contract stating that AXA could direct blockstream's efforts or leadership in any way, much less any of their partners.
3. Adam Back is one of the most well-documented cypherpunks on anyone's record. Before he wrote Hash Cash, which brought proof of work to where it is today, he worked on the systems that underlie TOR and Bittorrent. Now he's full time on bitcoin. How could anyone sanely assume that someone who spent decades working on the most important decentralized, cypherpunk projects ever be trying to harm the latest one by centralizing it? That's compelling evidence alone, if not proof, that Roger's off his rocker for all those baseless accusations he makes of Back on twitter.
4. At Blockstream, every developer is HIGHLY incentivized to make bitcoin's price go up. At hiring $10,000 worth of bitcoin is purchased (part of their hiring contract) and set aside for them, and they can't touch it for the first year. After year one, each paycheck is paid in it for four years, equally distributed over that time. This is well documented. If developers there saw plans to harm bitcoin, then they'd likely fight those plans to keep their paycheck valuable.
5. The most 'valuable target' in bitcoin core for any infiltrating source would naturally be the Commit keys, which allow the Wladamir-led team of core code cleaners (referred to as Janitors within the dev community) the final say on what becomes bitcoin and what doesn't. Commit access is a right on Github to add a change to the git repository. Anyone with a Github account can write changes and propose them to the bitcoin core code, but only those with commit keys can actual add those proposed changes to the repo. Today there are 4 bitcoin developers who work at Blockstream. Sipa is one, and although he has a commit key, due to the scaling debate he doesnt use his for scaling changes. Gmax used to have the 5th key, but gave it back because of the scaling debate. He doesn't even have the access he used to anymore.
If blockstream was trying to take over Bitcoin or lead it's governance in any way, they've not only failed, they've hobbled themselves so badly at it that it's now impossible.
The flat-earther-like Conspiracy theories about blockstream are now, like flat-eartherism, to the point where I can give you all the facts in the world and you'll still just ignore them and plug your ears because you want to believe that Roger is right about blockstream and that your worldview model is not being challenged.
Stop believing LIARS. Blockstream is one of the good guys.

Two major assumptions in your thinking that we can't possibly know yet:
1. That the damage to bitcoin wouldn't be far worse, even fatal. This can't be known yet, and certainly the media will be more than happy to report that "digital scarcity was proven to not exist anymore because there are now 42m bitcoins and who knows how many next week" as soon as the fork occurs.
2. We can fix the mess at all. What if it stays messy, and like Ethereum found out, we'll need more forks to fix it? What if Jihan attacks our chain with an empty block attack? You're taking a very risky attitude towards bitcoin's safety here.

It's really simple. Since no one can take away the open source software from you, software that you could even write yourself from scratch with a few skills, it's literally impossible for them to stop you trading with other bitcoiners when dealing only in bitcoin.
And that's the goal! Handling fiat is slow and klunky... Even without bans and bitlicesnses, converting currencies will always suck because you have to put up with the worst of both every time.
So screw it; STOP EARNING FIAT. It's that simple... Find a job or jobs that pay in bitcoin and stop messing around in fiat where they can slow you down, track you, and even take it away from you.

There are three important factors you are not figuring in your scenario.
A. Moonbeam. It's going to lighten the load soon. The fact that no one is talking about this is a testament to how determined the moonbeam devs are to keeping their head down to finish the code and stay away from the drama.
It won't be a cure, of course, but it will no doubt reduce fees once a few major payment channels are open between big players like hosted wallets and the largest exchanges &amp; merchants. This will give a more relaxed atmosphere, and in it, we'll be even less likely to try risky fixes and just keep waiting for segwit.
 
B.  Altcoins are going cookoo for segwit &amp; lightning. Syscoin, Vertcoin, Digibyte, Groelstcoin, and oh yeah, Litecoin, will all be sending Lightning transactions in weeks or even days from now. This wouldn't be a game changer by itself, but there is no larger test bed on earth to prove to BU supporters that Segwit and LN are proven tech than that. Their opposition should wither even more soon and all that will be left is the people Bitmain pays to fight.
C. ...But then they'll have Cross-Chain atomic swapping. Oh boy, this is where things get tricky. The only thing that can be said with any definitiveness about this is that Shapeshift will be out of business. Meanwhile, what exactly does it mean for all altcoins everywhere to be able to send and value to all people who accept any other altcoins effortlessly and without conversion nor fees... But not to bitcoin?
I think this will in effect turn all of the altcoins that can include Segwit into one single competitor to bitcoin, lets call it "everycoin," and everycoin could quickly overtake bitcoin once that happens. All bitcoin can hope for now is that alts don't implement the LN too fast. Otherwise Everycoin will rise to prominence before bitcoin wins its war to get segwit activated.
tl;dr: It's still too early to call it, but there will be big changes this year.

To answer this question, simply ask yourself how many people in the world will eventually be holding bitcoin?

To be fair, decentralized bitcoin has a major centralization problem right now. No matter if you believe Jihan and other miners are working for china or just out to monopolize the market, it's still a serious threat of centralizing bitcoin too much. Uncounted millions have been spend on propaganda (mostly by Roger ver) against letting bitcoin's development meritocracy do its job, and things are getting a little too serious lately.
If we successfully UASF away from the current situation, it will be a very strong, important event in the history of decentralized systems, showing that the users can and do have the power to overcome such hostile attempts.
It'll set a precedent that can't be ignored.

Untrue, I was calling for 4MB blocks there and on Reddit at the time.  The only time I've been censored was when I said something about assassination markets.


Your memory is flawed, 2-4MB has been OK since satoshi said it was OK. 
Hard forking to raise the block size, however, officially became too risky long before we watched Ethereum fail at doing so.
So any terms that say "No hard forks" has not just "become OK," its a baseline for simple sanity and a minimum bar at which bad devs are easily spotted.


If by "crippling" you mean setting it free to do coffee transactions, and by "centralized" you mean "completely decentralized," we can agree.


They are simply wrong. Roger and Jihan are spending untold millions of dollars on propaganda against the truth, and suckers like you are believing that propaganda.
Andressen, Hearn, and Garzik can show their face in public without getting it punched.

Technically, this is called brainwashing. What is being brainwashed but to fight against your best interests over being taught conflicting terminology?
When you boil it all down though, the natural state of free commerce unencumbered by government and other centralizing factors that make it less free is nothing more than a concept, and doesn't even need a name.

In this scenario, Alice would be Coinbase and bob would be Bitstamp. The two would have to set up a payment channel and pre-fund it first between them, and for you, as a coinbase user, to fund your BitStamp account would just send one transaction from a coinbase wallet without giving it any thought... Coinbase wouldn't add it to the blockchain, but you'd see it in your coinbase account and they'd see it in their private moonbeam channel log... But that's still somehow trustless, they say.
One day when the channel is closed, one blockchain transaction will be written to close the channel, even if a million customers sent transactions during that time.

If you put banking routing &amp; account numbers in a QR code, you can't simply send money in one click with that info.

Assuming it works as advertised, (and there was very little advertising about it) Moonbeam would help all fees come down for everyone by taking the surplus transaction load off of our overfull 1MB blocks and sending them through single-direction payment channels instead.
For us users, nothing would be different. Hosted wallets, exchanges, major merchants, and other businesses that handle a high number of transactions would set up moonbeam channels between each other and those are the only changes that would be made... 
Miners can't lift a finger to stop this, so they'll just have to be happy with the smaller number of fees they make. It won't be a drastic reduction though, no one thinks it could take away half or more of all transactions out of the blocks. 
And no, there is no such thing as a moonbeam token. Just like with the lightning network, moonbeam is a bitcoin transaction. It uses the same Payment Channel technology that Satoshi invented right before he left.

You're making some arguments here that are kinda circular. -Not that I disagree, but not for these reasons.
For instance, how will the rest of the world not using bitcoin now know that bitcoin is an alternative to the govts when the screws are turned? They aren't listening to us tell them that now, so it would most likely be that they all get surprised by an overnight govt raping and turn what little money they have left into the most accessible investment they already know about, like a car or gold coins... Who has time to research internet monies when your savings are halving each day?
Merchant adoption certainly isn't everything, but it is a huge sign of TRUST. If the person I just described above already knew that he could spend bitcoins at every place he spends dollars at today, then bitcoin would be on that list of easily accessible investments he already knows about.
More important than merchants, I'd say, is the killer app. Something like OpenBazaar or Joystream has the potential, when ready, to get every last person on the planet needing to hold a little bitcoin just to use those services. Giving those people ways to earn btc instead of local fiat would be the most important step of all.
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:48:08
That's just one way though. Bitcoin is simply not just one thing.
I treat it as cash money, to be spent on food or whatever.
I treat it as gold coins in the safe, tucked away in a cold wallet for longterm investment.
I treat it as a way to store business documents, that are completely not counterfietable, safe, secure, and accessible anywhere in the world.
And I even treat it as a social/gaming funtime token using services like changetip to show others appreciation for their work or funny comments.
In the future I look forward to treating it as about 1,000 other things as well.
@_date: 2015-10-14 03:37:54

The two terms are not at odds. 
Cold storage = Keeping your keys offline in any form, where they can't be found by hackers.
Hardware wallet = Keeping them in a device offline, where they can't be found by hackers. It's a specialization of cold storage.
Nano S, Keepkey, and Trezor are the three most popular hardware wallets of all, and they have a flawless record of not being hacked into directly. (Although some have had their backup seeds stolen)
Something else to consider:
Hardware wallets exist to allow spending from cold storage. That's the whole job.  If you keep your coins in paper wallets, you have to move them from paper to a normal wallet in order to be able to spend them. There is no sending functionality with paper... So it's technically safer but not convenient at all.

Alright, Snowden could have been a cross-department hack job. Maybe the CIA wanted to get their mitts on the NSA's budget. Maybe they just have an old, deep-seated rivalry and wanted to take them down however they could.
Regardless, no matter what the prompting for his actions, what he did harmed the government more than anything else imaginable.
Governments don't actually exist. Buildings and people exist, but governments are literally just a shared delusion that people agree is occupying those people and buildings.
If you take away the agreement than government should exist, it literally doesn't. -And all those agents, CIA and otherwise, suddenly don't have a budget anymore.
The last thing the CIA would have wanted is for Snowden to do what he did. The CIA was CERTAINLY harmed by his actions.

&lt;Warning: Optimism ahead&gt;
I think Moonbeam will help bitcoin scale first, but only a little, maybe just bringing fees down to ~ 10 cents again. That's permissionless and could happen as soon as next week.
Then, as all the altcoins will soon be happily using Lightning and cross-chain swapping with each other, the tech will be undisputable and attractive to all, so the final roadblocks against lightning and Segwit will eventually dissolve. I'd guess around the fall, and we'll finally segwit + lightning added by the new year. 
All the other many great plans Core devs have been working on don't need a controversial fork, so 2018 should be extremely smooth sailing with tiny fees and massive lightning roll-outs.
The only thing that could screw any of this up is just a guy named Jihan Wu. He can't hold out forever though. Pretty soon his product won't be sellable on the road he's travelling down.

Yep, 3.5 years ago, it's true. There were already rumblings of big-blocker fallout from Mike Hearn and others at the time.
The BearWhale went on about it, but I left this part of our interview out of the article for brevity:
"I do remember a lot of debate on bitcointalk.org, specifically the Development sub-forum. Bitcoin had a governance problem when I sold. Gavin was already acting weird and his salary was supported by non-sustainable "donations." There was that silly "bitcoin foundation" and the fighting over the protocol. And we had the drift from $1,200 down to $300. Maybe I interpolated recent events backwards in time?.”

Money is just another language. It isn't a force of evil any more than it is a force of good.
Even greed isn't that evil; it's very rational to want to hoard as much as you can; the evil comes from people willing to harm others in order to further their greed. 
Jihan is most certainly harming others by blocking segwit. I can't fault him for being a shrewd businessman, but his choices in how to use that power have been downright evil.

@_date: 2015-10-18 00:23:47
You are WAY too focused on the technical roadblocks of today. There are far larger issues afoot!
Yes, permissioned blockchains can be made with way more TPS and better networking stats, but then again, all this accomplishes is making another SQL database as long as it's a permissioned blockchain...
And Banks will *never* accept non-permissioned blockchains like bitcoin because they simply cannot control it if they don't hold all the keys. Heck, they can't even guarantee what currency moves across a free blockchain... And their currency is their product, plain and simple.
The OP briefly talked about trust in his video. What good is the banks' blockchains' better performance if they don't beat censorship or government interference? Their data is no better than the data moving across the legacy financial system today. It's not trustworthy. There are tons of other limitations, too:
* Are they going to be open to Billions of new customers? No, permissioned ledgers are a back-end-only network, not customer-facing. 
* Are they going to offer more speedy transactions than they had before? No, again, only settlement. 
* Can they at least offer a cryptographically-proven way that other banks will know without a doubt that they cannot be hacked or stolen from on this blockchain? Again, no. Using a permissioned chain creates points of human weakness that bitcoin doesn't have. One Rouge admin or hacker impersonating him can do far more damage that can be done now! (Since transactions are irreversible on blockchains.)
What good is any blockchain's performance if you can't trust the data on it to be what it should be? We've already got solutions to do what they are doing now without blockchains. They literally aren't offering anything new when they use buzzwords like 'blockchain' on their products.
Good video, but I think there are more than 9 reasons. Vastly more access to customers, the end of identity theft, and a better, freeer, customer-facing experience are three more that should have made the cut.

Tell that to the half million merchants now accepting bitcoin at their POS machines. Think they can all just flip a switch that changes all their integrated systems over to the litecoin network instead?
The Network Effect gives us far more leeway than many believe. It isn't infallible though, especially in the case of a hard fork.
The problem is, as soon as they do give up on Bitcoin, they're likely burnt out on all crypto... So we won't see those merchants and atm networks and debit cards and so on all just switch over to litecoin... We'll see most of them disappear for years or decades.

Too much badmouthing of Bitcoin in here, I just couldn't let this slander go undefended any longer...


The hell it has. Bitcoin is particularly awesome at staying out of that trap, like few things in life ever have been. 
It's original purpose and identity _could_ be screwed if everyone were to allow Jihan have his way with bitcoin, but don't worry, we won't. Honeybadger still don't give no shit.
I suppose the 2 reasons you might think it's already strayed from its purpose are 
1) Regulators are regulatin', and 
2) The block size debate has made it harder to use so micropayments and developing world apps seem impossible to you now. 
The former is stuff honeybadger doesn't care about because the point is to use bitcoin as money itself, not something you trade money for.... And the latter is a temporary problem that Satoshi new about and invented Payment channels to fix. Give lightning and other payment channel solutions a chance, they should be able to give us even smaller transactions than we had originally... Plus, no waiting for the 10 minute confirmation time, so they should be even _better_ than the visa network.


Your logic sucks. If you had any logical logic, you'd factor in that new people are coming into bitcoin at a rapid pace and they can't do that without buying... which makes the price go up. I'd be SERIOUSLY worried if this bull run stopped soon with all of these new Japanese adopters lately... And other things like the china investigations being over, bitfinex allowing withdrawals again, and even the WannaCry ransomware are all drivers of a bull market.


You never got bitcoin then... It has always differed from other commodities because it is the perfect money. You may not feel that way about it while the mempool is full, but c'mon, it is better than anything mankind has ever thought of before at holding and transferring... Value itself! How can this not become the dominant value on earth? And there's so few of them!  Anyone who can't see a million dollar bitcoin one day has no business owning one.

It would have quite a lot to do with bitcoin in a society where bitcoin was the money.
There have been no major wars since the Federal Reserve act that weren't funded with printing fiat. Even when they say it's on a gold reserve, that they're backing their fiat with gold, they're still only backing it partially, holding a small fraction of the gold and never, ever allowing people to come in and trade their cash for gold equivilent.
Back before the Fed reserve act, things were much more simple... Money had value outside of the local government decree. If your gold florins didn't buy you enough stuff in one country, you could take them to another and the sheer gold amount in them would buy you the normal amount there... Because gold was worth something universally, despite what govs printed on them.
Since people generally don't enjoy going to war, nor do they enjoy paying for the huge costs war, it's always been a political nightmare for democracies to initiate war... Until a new funding option made itself available with the fed reserve act.
Bitcoin won't allow it to happen anymore if only we adopt it.
So yes, if we accept bitcoin as our primary currency, to a point where governments have to use it and their weapons manufacturers won't accept some crappy fiat notes instead of it, then absolutely, it's empirically provable that bitcoin can stop modern wars.

It's really simple, we all witnessed it happen last summer with Ethereum. When a miner/miners with enough hashpower is willing to mine unprofitably, they can fork of simply by loading any client that breaks consensus. 
By himself, Jihan has way more than enough to fork bitcoin into two chains. With his extended influence over other large miners because he's their sole supplier, he's probably got enough to fork the chain as the majority fork. Maybe. 
So Yes, any miner or grouping of miners that can get enough hashpower ALWAYS have the ability to fork bitcoin away, but are economically incentivized not to do so.
If we draw a line in the sand and say 'on nov 16th,' we're going to make things really unprofitable for Jihan,' then we've just taken away his economic incentive to play nice, haven't we?

Nobody can be made ready for bitcoin. If they are against it, you only harm relationships by trying to convince them.
In time they'll come around due to the harsh realities of life, so just let them know you have the answers when they're ready.

Touche, I never noticed that someone slipped that in there.
Apparently some uncareful jackass believed it was a good-enough example to demonstrate network effects in that format that we all know so well; but social networks like FB &amp; Twitter are poor examples for network effects overall, because they are not protocols; merely products using the ultra-loose, 'social networking' protocol.
They use telephones as the classic example in there... Saying that Facebook is bound to the 'network effect' is like saying Motorola brand cellphones do.... But protocols go across brands, not along with them... ALL cellphones are bound to the network effect, not just motorola phones.
At any rate, it's confusing to have that example in there. Good catch.

Sometimes we form "original thoughts" after hearing lots of smaller points from others and compiling them into our own thoughts that they wanted us to think. This is the underlying nature of propaganda.
In this case, these 'original thoughts' you are having closely replicate everyone else's 'original' thoughts who have been listening to the Roger Ver / Jihan Wu brand of lies against the Bitcoin Core dev team and scaling off-chain. It's pretty obvious how anyone and everyone is coming to these "conclusions" after simply reading Roger's twitter feed or spending a few days on r/btc.
The fact is, however, the stuff you have been fed are easily contested falsehoods. Sadly, they are of the nature where there are no simple, one-sentence answers to explain them to you correctly. It takes study, and Roger's view is popular precisely because it doesn't take study. Much like medicine. It was once very popular to say headaches are the work of demons in the skull, so let's just cut a hole in it and let the demons out. 
Scaling on-chain is exactly like cutting the hole in your head. It might relieve a little pressure for a while, but it could kill you and it'll never solve the problem.
You say you want to "see how many transactions we can do onchain." That's being very well demonstrated right now... It's right at 3.3 tps per megabyte. There is no dispute. 
The uncomfortable fact is that to raise the block size above 1MB using a hard fork is very dangerous in this contentious atmosphere, likely resulting in an ETC-ETH style chain split. So that's why, several years ago, it was proposed we do it with a soft fork, raising the block size to as much as 4MB on-chain while we await Lightning. That's how we got Segwit and that's what Roger and Jihan are fighting Against... If you like larger blocks for a short-term resolution, be mad at them; they're the ones holding up larger blocks. 
Lightning is VERY interesting, it's just been presented to you poorly because there is little to present yet in how it will look and feel after it gets to the user. That user-facing interface has yet to be completed, but every dev worth his weight in lollipops can tell it's going to solve a LOT of scaling issues. -And even the confirmation time wait issue.
Imagine going into a store, paying with bitcoin like normal, your wallet automatically finding open channels for you so you don't have to think about it, paying a low fee of under a dime or less, and neither you nor the merchant need to think about confirmation times because lighting resolves instantly.  Ideal coffee money, maybe even better than Visa's. That's what LN promises, but it just won't all be ready on day 1.

This is the same question as asking if the public will accept bitcoin more. If so, the limited supply of coins, being unique in the world of currency, ensures that the price has to rise for more people to use bitcoin.
We've had at least four huge spikes (over x10 price in weeks or less) so far as adoption came in bursts. There's no reason to think we've seen the last burst unless we think bitcoin is dying. 
Clearly it is growing, so I expect another burst this year.

You're correct, &amp; I've personally had the same experience.

Still, they prefer big blocks. Why? F*ck if I know.
They sound like the CIA has personally tied them all to a chair and used MKULTRA tactics on them to make them irrationally fear small blocks.

Could you be more specific? Referring to the loose, decentralized group of 100+ developers who all work on their own vision of bitcoin as simply "core" is the surest way to muddy the water.


1. Besides Luke-jr, there is no such thing as a small blocker. Everyone who supports Bitcoin is a "big blocker," especially those backing segwit. I've talked to hundreds of people and developers, and only Luke-jr wants to keep blocks small. Everyone else wants 4MB or 8MB blocks that you call a "small blocker."
2. You're right that it's not because of risking decentralization primarily... That's a reason for not going to 16MB or larger, which makes running a node more expensive. The reason so many people want Segwit is that it's a SOFT FORK, which doesn't risk destroying bitcoin in an Ethereum-like chain split in this contentious environment.


The only dishonesty here is from Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. They pretend that the biggest obstacle to scaling aren't a threat and lie about what "blockstream core" says as if core developers are in blockstream's back pocket and are trying to control development.

Eth has scaling problems that make Bitcoin's look like a walk in the park. 
Eth is also doing a risky blockchain switch from proof of work to proof of stake later this year.

Arbchains sound interesting, but I believe the requirement for all arbcoin recipients to be running a full node already with all that data in place is a complete &amp; total deal killer for adoption. Maybe as a distinct sidechain, however. 
I agree that security at the edges of the Tangle aren't strong, but so far testing has shown it better than one might imagine, and where it does fail, it is a very localized failure.
This is not perfect, of course, but as the tangle grows thicker (more users) the devs assure that security grows stronger too. (imagine upgrading bitcoin to use a tangle with all those millions of users in place already!)
Meanwhile, it is extremely satisfying for all PoW to be done at the time of sending each transaction. This results in a solution to every one of bitcoin's problems, from centralization to traffic to fees, all in one move. 
Zero transaction fees is something no other system can offer and Bitcoin devs really need to investigate this innovation if for no other reason than to see what the improvements on usability would be like on a zero-fee network.

The point is, to get all of the users to choose the software located in either directory calls for a huge information/publicity or FUD campaign to get the mainstream to choose one over the other. Roger &amp; Jihan have been working for well over a year to get the opinion moved to 'anything but /bitcoin' so if barrycoin is successful, core devs, who are not marketers, could make all the great software decisions you want them to but they don't have the will to hire a PR company to get public opinion to move the public will back to a bitcoin located at /bitcoin.

If you had any reading comprehension skills, you would have noticed that I said "above" 8MB, not 8MB itself. I still wouldn't want to see how slow and expensive nodes would be at 8MB though, sounds like a nightmare.


Lol, not on any chain that core devs will be supporting. 
 


Section 4, Proof-of-Work. You might want to read it over and over again until you get it.


Because their hardware is now useless? 
Miners are all bitcoin nodes, but nodes do not need to be miners. In 2009, the only way to mine a bitcoin was to have your node do it directly, inside the client debug window, mining on your CPU. 
What we think of as miners are just people who bought additional, non-core-approved hardware to increase their chances of doing the same. That's it. 
We never needed them, we can all just mine on our PCs and GPU cards just fine and maintain a far higher level of decentralization.
A change to bitcoin's client software can make that mining hardware obsolete and those miners blocks would be rejected, a la UASF, in no time flat. In fact I've seen the code that was written to do just that.
Deploying it now might be a good idea, but we certainly wouldn't have consensus yet. Politically it's near impossible to do. -But if a Govt swooped in to try to control bitcoin for any reason, the movement would have a fire lit under it's ass immediately, and it would get adopted without any problems.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:49:40


Because the point in $20 nodes is to be able to run far larger blocks. Really, anything above 8MB becomes useless due to propagation times, and requires a server rack which is illegal to be run at home anyway.
If that's what you want for bitcoin, I'm sure there's a ton of Govcoin projects, like Ripple, that would welcome you with open arms. 


If you understood the whitepaper, you'd know the answer to that.
It's a consensus thing. We won't all agree to fork away and fire those miners over something trivial like a 2x increase over the block size, but if a Govt swoops in and steals bitcoin from us, we could do what we did in early 2013 when the protocol was broken and roll out a new Bitcoin client within HOURS and everyone would upgrade, firing the government.

Yes. Most definitely. It won't be the kind of price drop you'd see if there was a fight over bitcoin's brand... This altcoin is clearly labeled as an altcoin and has very limited access to markets... But the simple fact is that it's value must come from somewhere. So if it's price goes to $500, then Bitcoin's price could likely fall by $500.
But like the ETH / ETC split, they can both grow afterwards. ETH managed to grow ~20x after it spit out an altcoin.

It's just that they refuse to believe that Bitcoin can replace their product, Fiat money, one day.  They aren't trying to actively squash that threat because it just seems impossible for it to become mainstream.
So they studied it, noticed that handy ledger, proclaimed bitcoin itself not a threat, and decided to make their own blockchain...
...Which one day they'll realize can never be a secure as The blockchain.

This game is only played on the grounds of semantics.
We're literally talking about the definition of the phrase "block size." 
Opponents of Segwit keep using contradictory terms like "New section" or "separate container" that muddy the water, allowing noobs to be fooled into imagining that there would still be 1MB blocks and then variable-size extra blocks mined too. 
Case in point: "a new 3mb limited section containing extra data is introduced."
Meanwhile, each transaction in every block is always on a line, both with and without segwit. I've seen them.
Lines are literally reorganized to put the witness information at the end, where it isn't hashed, and doesn't need to be stored after being used once.
The public perception is very, very misleading.

Yes, &amp; it's even worse. 
Since they are spread out between so many bitcoin addresses, it'll be impossible for them to be tracked on the blockchain (to watch if he's up to something) it won't look unnatural at all for them to be spent...

False. There have already been LN transactions on Litecoin, Vertcoin, Digibyte, and perhaps others. The User Interface doesn't make it seamless yet, but again, six different teams are working on that and now have more incentive to produce it after altcoins started implementing segwit.

I think if 2140 arrives and mankind learns that Satoshi has chosen the date correctly as the point in time when mining rewards are no longer needed, that will be the ultimate proof that time travel exists.
There is No Way anyone today could guess when those incentives would no longer be valuable. The number of factors affecting that date are mind-bogglingly huge... Starting with the future size of the population of mankind in 100 years and how much economic activity we all are generating then. Only a time traveller from that time could know these numbers.

Um, no. Maybe $500 an hour. Learn this chart well: 
Note how there isn't just a problem with hard disk space... RAM is the worst problem since you can't even buy a motherboard today that goes above 128GB, and they get really expensive well below that. Then Bandwidth starts looking really expensive too by 8MB blocks... THEN I'd say HD space becomes important above 16MB, and of course there is the latency problem as well because larger files move slower around the planet, making miners closer to their users richer than those further away.


No one said they're gods. They're humans, participating in an open source project like countless linux distros and Github projects today.
In all of those cases, the spun-off fork of a project doesn't keep the parent's name as it forks off. That would be dishonest.
If you want to remove the core devs from github's bitcoin/bitcoin repository, you're welcome to fork off and put every other dev in the world there all at once... But you gotta call it something new. Like, say, Litecoin.
Altcoins are what you get when you fork cryptocurrencies. Silbert's plan to move bitcoin over to the /BTC1 directory at github is great as long as he doesn't try to call that software "bitcoin." Since it appears that they are trying to do so, the development community has loudly responded.


Sure it is. Read it again until you get it.


They aren't likely to get more nodes. Nodes and Devs can make mining hardware useless... But if they truly deployed more Nodes and the market wanted the coins that those nodes verify, then yeah, that's bitcoin's achillies heel. They'll be the majority in that case and we'll all have to abandon blockchains for something like Iota.
There's over 38,000 nodes deployed today across all countries of the world. We'll know it if someone spins up another 38k nodes.
When it gets to that level, it becomes an international concern. Does Putin want Trump to have control of it? The PRC probably already has the most control to date, so those two might gang up together if they feel China's node count is threatening their ability to have a fair say in Bitcoin.

1. It was EX-FREAKING-ZACTLY the same way with the internet. (I saw it firsthand)
2. "the current atmosphere surrounding Bitcoin means that for this fabled mass adoption to take place, the masses need to adopt these beliefs." -Is a hugely false assumption. Mass adoption depends on people finding something valuable, no matter who the bringer of that value is. If they, for instance, really like OpenBazaar and start buying bitcoins to use OB regularly, who says they even need to speak to one of us to do so?

Exchanges that give you cash for your coins only report to the fedcoats. If your purpose is to hide your identity from the company you're selling your domains to, then any wallet that doesn't require ID is fine for your needs.

I agree that the distribution is just as important.

Hey look; coins that have been dead for 2,000 years are still worth way more than the USD:
Yes, that's for collectors' value. Do you think bitcoins won't have any collectors' value if they fall out of primary usage somehow?
Therefore, they simply cannot go to $0, it's literally impossible without the blockchain being destroyed... And good luck with that.
So, since they'll always have value, then they're always going to be awesome at what they were designed to do.

I don't know how to break it down further for you, it makes perfect sense to me and others I've talked to about it.
You asked "Where are the coins from those portfolios held? If at all?"
I answered Ethereum's blockchain, which is commonly known as a place where you can store smart contracts. 
I then linked the quote from my article detailing precisely where for you; the coins are held in smart contracts, that you buy with ether.
So basically, you send Prism $100 worth of Ether, they make a contract that holds your ether as collateral and "issues" you the asset of your choice... Except that you don't actually hold it, because it only exists on the Ethereum blockchain too.

The Bitpay card is extremely useful for people who need to sell bitcoin fast... For instance, selling BTC from a coinbase acct takes a most-of-a-week banking delay for the funds to arrive in your bank account.
Meanwhile, spendable USD arrives on a bitpay card within 3 confirmations of sending them your BTC. That's a rare find that I hope I don't have to use much, but am glad it's there when I need it.

The day is rapidly approaching when the promises that Satoshi/Bitcoin made to the world (Truly P2P, alternative economy, unprecidented security, etc.) will be delivered to the masses.
So far the mainstream has always been constantly disappointed by our advertisements of all these things and when they arrive they use centralized, AML-ridden exchanges and send their coins to centralized, broken, single-signature wallets. 
It's frankly embarrassing. We know we have the tech, we just need to deploy it right... But at least some people are already trying to do so, like multisig wallet providers and marketplaces like OB.
Hopefully 2016 will arrive with the ability for noobs to be delivered these promises from the start.

It's too simplistic though; there are many things missing that need to be addressed to ease my mind. Such as:
1. Where's the 3rd chain that Jihan could make via a hard fork if he thinks he's losing? How will we fight that?
2. Since the moment that the world hears that there are two Bitcoin blockchains, and therefore 42 Million bitcoins, (oh yes they most certainly would see it that way) the idea of Digital Scarcity becomes a joke to most people, the price doesn't stay the same for a chain... We must expect the existing chain to drop below $100 while the other has to start from scratch. This is a point Vinny Lingham and others have made many times. Meanwhile, Litecoin or something else takes Bitcoin's place as the new top crypto in market cap &amp; assumes some of it's network effects. 
3. Since mining isn't profitable at some point, last I heard was $377 per bitcoin, that drop would likely mean bitcoin is no longer mined by anyone who is trying to make a profit. The rest of this slide deck is nonsensical then because mining profit incentives are no longer present.
4. There also needs to be a parallel track of the Exchanges actions. Who is incentivizing the exchanges to list which chain as bitcoin and which as the altcoin? With BU, we were protected by knowing that exchanges would list the new chain as BTU coin, but now UASFers will be the underdog and exchanges (especially those supporting Barry's agreement) are likely to list JihanCoin as Bitcoin no matter what.
I'm sorry, but I'm still not onboard with BIP148 because there are too many risks and unanswered questions about threat contengencies.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:25:24
Eth wasn't a store of value. Investors seeing their preferred store of value (bitcoin) splitting would be a major shake to their confidence in both chains of it. I'm betting the price would drop to single digits for the larger of the two coins... If a second coin is issued at all, of course. (Exchanges seem against that possibility)

You pretend that the OP is simply selling off his bitcoins, throwing his hands up, and saying he's out though... Far from the truth, I'd suspect.

The establishment absolutely cannot fight bitcoin. They try as hard as they can to regulate, but that's not good enough to fight it considering bitcoin's nature.

1. BitPay is far ahead of the others.
2. Check out your local bitcoin meetup.com group.

4. Yes, there are tens of thousands of physical stores that sell stuff in person. Here's a map where you can list yourself: 
5. As long as there is electricity and an internet connection, which is pretty much required these days to stop an actual apocalypse, bitcoin works and can't be shut down. Technically carrier pigeons can carry btc transactions too, (yes, it was tested) but that's not a very fast network. -The cool thing is that even if the power grid goes down for a decade, your keys to your coins are completely secure however you've got them stored, such as a paper wallet, dat file, or USB backup.

WTF are you imagining non-contentious upgrades to be?
By contentious, devs only mean that people out here in meatspace don't agree what we want, and like we saw with ETH-&gt;ETC, someone is able to fork the chain to make a new coin. Like you said yourself, anyone can launch a HF.

@_date: 2017-06-04 01:45:12
1. Only exchanges know the answer to that, and THEY have to come to their own consensus over that process.
2. In fact, it's likely that many won't even list the new coin, and will only track the existing chain... Expect Coinbase and any of Barry's signatories to do this at the very least.
3. The moment there are two chains, bitcoin's price could fall to sub $100 or even sub $1 anyway, so I'm not so convinced the difference will be enough to matter between any two coins called bitcoin.

3. The fact that Satoshi hasn't moved the bulk of his coins to another address since mining means that he hasn't burned them, and so he could still have a plan to do something major with them, like solve major world problems, when btc has become the world reserve currency.

Well, we'll probably wake up that morning to a $1000 bitcoin before any action starts... Because traders will be anticipating the crash beforehand.
When the change hits, we won't know who's winning at first, then the media is sure to get it wrong... Probably report the death of bitcoin and scare traders further.
12 hours later, Jihan will hard fork ( and possibly could kill bitcoin. We'll have two chains but that doesn't mean that we'll have two bitcoins... That depends on the exchanges, and if they issue one, and to who.
Media will love that... "Extra, Extra, 42 million bitcoins, Satoshi lied!"
Worst case scenario, $1 bitcoins that night but we won't know if they can survive or not. Or who one until all mining power &amp; nodes are accounted for. 
Best case scenario: $100 bitcoins that night, but there is a clear winner running Segwit.
If the latter happens, we'll be back up to $3000 bitcoins in no time and maybe hit $10,000 this year. No problem with Jihan out of the way.

The flat-earther-like Conspiracy theories about blockstream are now, like flat-eartherism, to the point where I can give you all the facts in the world and you'll still just ignore them and plug your ears because you want to believe that Roger is right about blockstream and that your worldview model is not being challenged.
If you had one shred of decency, you'd investigate the following, easily proven or disproven points for yourself:
1. Blockstream isn't even the company with the most bitcoin devs. 100% of Chaincode's devs are Bitcoin core devs: 
2. The 'corporate money' that blockstream accepted, AXA, is just a French investment bank, not goldman sachs. There was no contract stating that AXA could direct blockstream's efforts or leadership in any way, much less any of their partners.
3. Adam Back is one of the most well-documented cypherpunks on anyone's record. Before he wrote Hash Cash, which brought proof of work to where it is today, he worked on the systems that underlie TOR and Bittorrent. Now he's full time on bitcoin. Why in the hell would anyone assume that someone who spent decades working on the most important decentralized, cypherpunk projects ever be trying to harm the latest one by centralizing it? That's compelling evidence alone, if not proof, that Roger's off his rocker for all those baseless accusations he makes of Back on twitter.
4. At Blockstream, every developer is HIGHLY incentivized to make bitcoin's price go up. At hiring $10,000 worth of bitcoin is purchased (part of their hiring contract) and set aside for them, and they can't touch it for the first year. After year one, each paycheck is paid in it for four years, equally distributed over that time. This is well documented. If developers there saw plans to harm bitcoin, then they'd likely fight those plans to keep their paycheck valuable.
5. The most 'valuable target' in bitcoin core for any infiltrating source would naturally be the Commit keys, which allow the Wladamir-led team of core code cleaners (referred to as Janitors within the dev community) the final say on what becomes bitcoin and what doesn't. Commit access is a right on Github to add a change to the git repository. Anyone with a Github account can write changes and propose them to the bitcoin core code, but only those with commit keys can actual add those proposed changes to the repo.
Today there are 4 bitcoin developers who work at Blockstream. Sipa is one, and although he has a commit key, due to the scaling debate he doesnt use his for scaling changes. Gmax used to have the 5th key, but gave it back because of the scaling debate. He doesn't even have the access he used to anymore.
If blockstream was trying to take over Bitcoin or lead it's governance in any way, they've not only failed, they've hobbled themselves so badly at it that it's now impossible.
Stop believing LIARS. Blockstream is one of the good guys.

Another one got loose Guys.... I'll nail it down.
At Blockstream, every developer is HIGHLY incentivized to make bitcoin's price go up, thus incentivizing working against the vision you seem to believe they are following. At hiring $10,000 worth of bitcoin is purchased (part of their hiring contract) and set aside for them, and they can't touch it for the first year. After year one, each paycheck is paid in it for four years, equally distributed over that time. This is well documented. If developers there saw plans to harm bitcoin, then they'd likely fight those plans to keep their paycheck valuable.
Scaling off-chain is, as you know, required for bitcoin to be used in daily payments. Blockstream hasn't stated their price sheet yet for liquid, nor their version of the Lightning Network, but yet they are attacked for thinking about it. These are just two of the projects they are working for towards scaling anyway, and they don't make up a large percentage of their other projects that do not involve scaling.  Meanwhile, why penalize specifically Blockstream for trying to make a buck from off-chain scaling when we can name at least 10 other projects/companies trying to do the same?
The most 'valuable target' in bitcoin core for any infiltrating source would naturally be the Commit keys, which allow the Wladamir-led team of core code cleaners the final say on what becomes bitcoin and what doesn't.
Today there are 4 bitcoin developers who work at Blockstream. Sipa is one, and although he has a commit key, due to the scaling debate he has publicly sworn off using his key for scaling changes. Maxwell used to have the 5th key, but he actually gave it back a year ago because of the scaling debate. He doesn't even have the access he used to anymore.
So if blockstream was trying to take over Bitcoin or lead it's governance in any way, they've not only failed, they've hobbled themselves so badly at it that it's now impossible.

If you read the devlist, it's clear no one is being censored there. Garzik and other people with horrible ideas post and they aren't being told to not post anymore... They just get no support for their bad ideas.
Those with instantly-recognizably good ideas (and we see this a lot with the anonymous profiles now so it can't be popularity nor authority) get immediate support. The Meritocracy is working extremely well.
I can only imagine that people who feel good ideas are being kept out of development simply don't know that the developers stay the hell away from reddit and only participate on the linuxfoundation list. -It's readable by all.

Absolutely, in this controversial environment.
Something the Devs know implicitly that 90% of the rest of the community doesn't seem to get is that Blockchains in an open source development project like Bitcoin are in danger while hard forking... Never from technical reasons though; for political reasons. People reasons.
Ethereum's hard fork didn't go as planned because there was a people-based reason that made some people want to take that scheduled fork and keep the offshoot alive. 
Ethereum's community of users was about 1% as controversy-filled as this community is. Asking Bitcoin's community to coordinate a hard fork and not split the coin in two is like asking a world Congress to vote unanimously on a religious matter. 
I honestly don't think Bitcoin can ever safely hard fork again. Ever. Even with a decade of ramp-up time.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:34:43
Even in the case of a soft fork?
These are really technical questions we have NOT had answered well enough by a consensus of developers. I don't want to take just some already UASF-promoting devs' word for this...

The Segwit2x code is in a separate repository that Garzik and other non-core-devs control like a hawk. Once Segwit2x is activated, there is no guarantee that they'll ever let go of it and the Core devs aren't invited to commit/submit to it.
Segwit2x is seizing control of bitcoin, plain and simple.

I guess you have two considerations.
1. Yes, the evil thing. He's harming bitcoin and you shouldn't support that with your money. The more ppl throw money at him, the more he suceeds in harming bitcoin and eventually you have no bitcoin to mine.
2. Since he's being so belligerent, Core devs and others are looking for a way to make his chips ineffective. They could, with enough support, change bitcoin to make ASIC mining entirely useless, and we all go back to mining bitcoin with GPUs or even CPUs like Satoshi wanted. (The nuclear option, but it's being looked at now.)
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:55:32
Are you suggesting that no one is afraid of a chain split scaring away investors from bitcoin?
Adam Back seems to have pretty strong feelings on the subject:  
Vinny Lingham too: 
Plenty of others as well.
Since Pizza Day, Bitcoin has grown to become a store of value that people put their trust in. That is in fact it's killer app. 
That trust is based in us thinking it will be worth the same tomorrow as it is today. The human condition makes us all desire security more than we want our wealth to grow, and a split in half like a stock split is the opposite of that.
I came to these conclusions long before Back or Vinny said anything. Most likely in 2011, in fact, so that was a fortuitious choice of insult there, by the way. 
This is an inescapable conclusion taught in Austrian economics; bitcoin has been enabled by it so far, but splitting bitcoin into two coins will fight it for the first time ever.
@_date: 2017-06-29 09:17:12
So you agree then; none at all. 
Have you ever stopped to consider that the people don't want what the govt wants in money? Sure, we're taught in school that we should value a stable currency that we can price items in, but when given the choice, we all take the currency that is on it's way up because we are rationally greedy.
When you crack open a history book and read about what horrors all civilizations have to Constantly endure year after year due to the mismanagement (or worse) by central authorities, you come to value this decentralized experiment more than anything that smells like a "stable" currency. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:10:39
But having a second coin issued in the first place will do the job of devaluing them quite well enough.
I'm betting that the moment mainstream investors hear that there are 42 million bitcoins, there won't be a bitcoin on this planet that I can buy a proper lunch with.

Is it plausible to cap the price for all food at one penny per item?
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:59:38
Lots of people see it, and have argued the point in other situations, like Adam Back did a couple of years ago:  
Sadly, few are seeing the danger with UASF. Maybe because it's a soft fork, the water is muddied.
Unfortunately, if the 2nd coin is issued, an occurrence that Dev don't have any control over, the fact that it's a soft fork doesn't matter... The market will freak out over there simply being 42m bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:48:27
If there is no contention in the community, then it's no big deal. If even 1% stands in the way though, a new coin can emerge from a HF, and investors simply do not want this. 
So a HF will likely always be a deal killer for those holding value in bitcoin.
Time to face facts. We're already at the point where scaling and major (HF-requiring) upgrades are forced off chain. That's not the end of the world, though.

The amount of work they put into bitcoin was far larger than Satoshi's. They've defended it from countless attacks of all kinds that other teams never would have seen coming. They know more about it's inner workings and incentive balancing than every whale put together and the entire population of reddit. The idea that bitcoin should be taken away from them and entrusted to others is right up there with saying Superman's powers should be taken away and given to an unknown government crony. Please go soak your head for thinking it. 


Super wealthy corporations are EXACTLY what you get after you let government take over your open source project. Just yesterday Telegram's CEO displayed how that happens very nicely:   The threat is real, and govcoin/cronycorp coin is the coin YOU want, clearly.

They'll even call it 42 million bitcoins, no doubt... But make them sound twice as risky as before.
They'll also say "Well if they split once before without the developer's control, it can happen every week now, too... So digital scarcity is in fact, dead."

Depends on your needs and geography.
Some cards hold the balance in bitcoin (like shift) but change out at the time of payment, others hold the balance in fiat (like bitpay) and seem less useful but actually are the greatest way to sell coins fast.
The US doesn't allow good cards like Wirex and Xapo to be shipped to them, so that's usually a problem for many. Figure out what use you need the card for first and which cards are available for you... There probably won't be a choice anymore.

You think Jihan just pulled all his factories and mines out of his rear for free?
A precedence will have been set. If Bitcoin moves to SHA3 and Jihan's empire is ruined, all mining manufacturers and pool owners forever more will be afraid of doing the same thing Jihan did because the users have shown they have the power to take it all away from them.
The trade off is what we have to worry about... Doing this can harm bitcoin's security in terms of not getting large manufacturer(s) to appear, and therefore the new mining industry wouldn't be that strong against large-scale attack from a rich attacker who can make lots of SHA3 chips.

I can't argue for or against that point, although I suspect you're on to something.
However, my point was strictly about exchange issuance. UASF makes another blockchain, at which time exchange businesses, including Coinbase and those signing Barry's accord, will have to choose whether or not to issue the UASF chain a coin, which they then get to name.
This fact killed BU's hostile takeover dead in it's tracks when exchanges announced they'd be issuing it a BTU coin, not letting it be called bitcoin.
UASF's coin will face similar issues... Not to mention two bitcoins will scare away 95% of all investors.

 7. Exchanges do list the new coin, but the price immediately collapses sub $100 because investors don't understand anything but the fact that there are now two bitcoins and therefore the scarcity of bitcoin, now at 42m, was doubled and therefore digital scarcity was just a big lie. All cryptocurrencies take a major beating after that. - Oh yeah, and then, it's no longer profitable to mine bitcoins so who knows what Jihan will do then...

Investors do not think this way, at all.  Both retail and institutional investors don't give a flying figleaf how we few nerds think about altcoins and open source development teams...
They're hard-wired to look at such securities as stocks, and the difference between bitcoin and litecoin looks to them like the difference between AAPL and GOOG.
If Bitcoin splits into two coins, how else can they process that information other than as a stock split? Since both coins will be contending to be the one, true bitcoin, they wouldn't even know who to believe if we told them. (Which I'm sure both sides will, on the nightly news, even)
Since Satoshi promised digital scarcity, and it's the  interesting and important feature of bitcoin to pretty much everyone, having a stock split is breaking the rules. 21m coins becoming 42m coins _IS_ bitcoin defaulting on it's primary promise. That's a total lack of scarcity, the whole point of bitcoin.
Bottom line: The issuance of a 2nd bitcoin removes all non-true-believer investors from bitcoin, period. That should be about 35 of the 40 billion dollar market cap, at least.

If there's even one of them, out of all the governments, all the central banks, all the megabanks, all the megarich who live at our expense, just one of those powerful people who have figured out what bitcoin's reason to be is, wouldn't they be absolutely idiotic to sit by and do nothing while bitcoin grows in strength?

If it's been locked in at the same time Segwit was, yes. 
Jihan has already said that he will not support Barry's compromise if the HF isn't locked in from the same action that locks in Segwit.

Well, Satoshi did invent payment channels, so...

So far I see that communication speed and decentralization are the primary benefits of FIBRE, once included into Bitcoin. Are there any other benefits worth noting?

Yes!  We knew you could do it, Patrick!

I agree, but quite a few altcoins are now directly tradeable for fiat as well.

Needing bigger blocks doesn't make hard forking any less retarded.
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:16:19
Um, Satoshi put the 1MB block size in place.
Satoshi also invented payment channels to enable scaling off chain.
Back then devs knew (but Mike Hearn and Gavin disagreed) that scaling on-chain was for dum-dums. Back then, we're talking before bitcoin had any value, Devs knew as they know now; that you have to scale off chain.
IDIOTS have disagreed with this consistently ever since, getting int the way of progress, to cause the exact problem you blame on the core devs.

Their financial interest is to take an action that could kill bitcoin, period.
There is no other way this can be rationally interpreted. Feelings don't protect code from chain splits.

Patience. 


True, but the world of finance doesn't simply put one number beside us all to represent our total wealth. We all have diversified portfolios in one way or another, and bank accounts used to pay taxes with are only one of the methods we all keep. Bitcoin and some other cryptos will sneak in around that channel at first. Maybe everyone will need browser tokens to pay for things they can't get otherwise. Maybe we'll all see Cloud value (digital gold) as the best store of value on earth. There are still many contenders for Bitcoin's killer app. Whatever forms it will take, people will eventually come to understand and appreciate bitcoin's total package.  


Haven't you been paying attention? Their holdings are in fiat, dwindeling in value. Satoshi Nakamoto is about to be the world's first Trillionaire and there are a few Bitcoin billionaires already.
The 1% changes.

Did you just argue that we need protection, provided by some sort of a government, from ourselves? I don't think you're going to fit in around here very well. Try r/communism for people who think more like you.


Of course it's not useful to price items in, but that's only because it's still growing. Right now less than 1% of the world's population is hodling. When they all are, and all the markets that can benefit from bitcoin have tapped it, (say, 20 years from now) then bitcoin can't have any of these huge bull markets again because there are no more new markets or people to invest that aren't already in.
I, and everyone else I knew back in 2011, have understood this implicitly and told people ever since to only hodl, not to use bitcoin as a transactional currency yet other than for testing. Merchant adoption can wait.

UASF isn't a hard fork. It kinda pokes a stick at those who would hard fork though.
Meanwhile, bitcoin is being absolutely destroyed so even if they are firmly against risking with a HF, at some point it becomes the lessor risk.
@_date: 2016-07-30 02:02:28
Vitalik and others believe that people who only want bitcoin to survive and rule the entire cryptocurrency landscape are the main buyers of ETC simply because it harms ETH, which is bitcoin's biggest competitor in terms of market cap.
As a maximallist myself, I'm sure that there is some truth to this but it's not the main driver. The split is the kind of move that maximallists will high-five each other over, but not invest large amounts of money in.
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:23:04
Lol. Ethereum is a nerd toy's fuel. An experimental, unfinished appcoin.
Even it's head devs say eth is NOT money, and they refuse to implement monetary policy.
Bitcoin is the  purely digital store of value on this planet.
Comparing the two for this purpose is beyond laughable.

Until I checked out blockstream's situation, I might have agreed. You're absolutely backwards in this case though.
Check out the following facts for yourself:
1. Blockstream isn't even the company with the most bitcoin devs. 100% of Chaincode's devs are Bitcoin core devs: 
2. The 'corporate money' that blockstream accepted, AXA, is just a French investment bank, not goldman sachs. There was no contract stating that AXA could direct blockstream's efforts or leadership in any way, much less any of their partners.
3. Adam Back is one of the most well-documented cypherpunks on anyone's record. Before he wrote Hash Cash, which brought proof of work to where it is today, he worked on the systems that underlie TOR and Bittorrent. Now he's full time on bitcoin. Why in the hell would anyone assume that someone who spent decades working on the most important decentralized, cypherpunk projects ever be trying to harm the latest one by centralizing it? That's compelling evidence alone, if not proof, that Roger's off his rocker for all those baseless accusations he makes of Back on twitter.
4. At Blockstream, every developer is HIGHLY incentivized to make bitcoin's price go up. At hiring $10,000 worth of bitcoin is purchased (part of their hiring contract) and set aside for them, and they can't touch it for the first year. After year one, each paycheck is paid in it for four years, equally distributed over that time. This is well documented. If developers there saw plans to harm bitcoin, then they'd likely fight those plans to keep their paycheck valuable.
5. The most 'valuable target' in bitcoin core for any infiltrating source would naturally be the Commit keys, which allow the Wladamir-led team of core code cleaners (referred to as Janitors within the dev community) the final say on what becomes bitcoin and what doesn't. Commit access is a right on Github to add a change to the git repository. Anyone with a Github account can write changes and propose them to the bitcoin core code, but only those with commit keys can actual add those proposed changes to the repo.
Today there are 4 bitcoin developers who work at Blockstream. Sipa is one, and although he has a commit key, due to the scaling debate he doesnt use his for scaling changes. Gmax used to have the 5th key, but gave it back because of the scaling debate. He doesn't even have the access he used to anymore.
If blockstream was trying to take over Bitcoin or lead it's governance in any way, they've not only failed, they've hobbled themselves so badly at it that it's now impossible.
Stop believing LIARS. Blockstream is one of the good guys.

Of course we do. We want Layer 2 to take us to the mainstream because layer 1 (on-chain) MUST AT ALL COSTS be preserved as the most decentralized, P2P, trustless, antifragile layer.
That's where the whole game is played. You centralize layer 1 and you are left with nothing but Govcoin.  Centralize layers 2-10 all you like, we don't care because layers 11-infinity can be as dark and unregulated as we want.
...But they can't even exist if you centralize layer one.

Yep, and he included it into the code too.
It's a shame he couldn't stick around a little longer and see a real fix materialize in time.

Another one got loose Guys.... I'll nail it down.
At Blockstream, every developer is HIGHLY incentivized to make bitcoin's price go up, thus incentivizing working against the vision you seem to believe they are following. At hiring $10,000 worth of bitcoin is purchased (part of their hiring contract) and set aside for them, and they can't touch it for the first year. After year one, each paycheck is paid in it for four years, equally distributed over that time. This is well documented. If developers there saw plans to harm bitcoin, then they'd likely fight those plans to keep their paycheck valuable.
Scaling off-chain is, as you know, required for bitcoin to be used in daily payments. Blockstream hasn't stated their price sheet yet for liquid, nor their version of the Lightning Network, but yet they are attacked for thinking about it. These are just two of the projects they are working for towards scaling anyway, and they don't make up a large percentage of their other projects that do not involve scaling. Meanwhile, why penalize specifically Blockstream for trying to make a buck from off-chain scaling when we can name at least 10 other projects/companies trying to do the same?
The most 'valuable target' in bitcoin core for any infiltrating source would naturally be the Commit keys, which allow the Wladamir-led team of core code cleaners the final say on what becomes bitcoin and what doesn't.
Today there are 4 bitcoin developers who work at Blockstream. Sipa is one, and although he has a commit key, due to the scaling debate he has publicly sworn off using his key for scaling changes. Maxwell used to have the 5th key, but he actually gave it back a year ago because of the scaling debate. He doesn't even have the access he used to anymore.
So if blockstream was trying to take over Bitcoin or lead it's governance in any way, they've not only failed, they've hobbled themselves so badly at it that it's now impossible.

The thing that offends me about cashing out so much bitcoin has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin going up, but the usefulness of the dollars going down.
If you just want to live the rich life asap, why don't you try cashing half to dollars now (round-robin on every exchange you can access) and keep the other half in BTC knowing that bitcoin is going to BE money before you can spend the 1st half?
