I think you're conflating two very separate things: the usage of profanity and the usage of profane insults.
Obviously some words are more appropriate in some contexts than others. But you don't have to be a professional to hold a valid opinion, and you don't even need to phrase your opinion in a professional way. If I say "DUDEBRO, I'M SUPER FUCKIN' CERTAIN THAT THE SUN, LIKE, IS A STAR," I'm still right regardless of my phrasing.
Profanity doesn't make something invalid, just unprofessional. There's an important distinction.

that's not really how it works

there is zero incentive for anyone to actually mine there, just for the owners to draw miners in

Here's a tip: Gmail removes punctuation from its addresses, so something sent to foo.bar will go to foobar You can use this to enter a bunch of different emails (f.oobar, fo.obar, foo.bar, foob.ar, fooba.r, f..oobar, et cetera) and have them all sent to one valid email.
Or you can just use the same one repeatedly in this scenario, because Blockchain doesn't require a unique email.

Firstly, Bitcoin has been the largest distributed computing project for a very long time- it's not like one day Google will wake up with their huge piles of supercomputers, start mining, and have 99% of the hashrate.
Secondly, it's not like it's a race- if there are two computers mining in their own private blockchain, one at 99 hashes per second and one at 1 hash per second, the fast computer won't mine every block- just an amount that approaches 99% of them. Bitcoin is designed so that even the weakest computers still have at least a chance in the mining game.
Thirdly, "runs the production and minting of the currency?" Minting is controlled by the network to occur at the same rate no matter how much power is going into the system. If our hypothetical organization with SUPER SUPER COMPUTERS that are somehow many times more powerful than the biggest distributed computing project does exist and start mining, they'll get the majority of the coins, but the rate of minting will not change.
