I appreciate you commiserating. I know many other people have been scammed out of their funds from exchanges. I guess I'm too sensitive, on an existential level I take it personal when people work against total sovereignty and liberation. Especially in light of the intelligence and technology involved in maintaining this datasphere, to consider that such power is being used maliciously is disheartening. 
Live and learn, I guess. 
Peace

There is no Uncle Sam. Just groups of people who pretend there is such an entity.
Transactions are already tracked anyway on the blockchain ledger, and government-issued identity is already verified with Poloniex (driver's license, etc.). At this point, it is excessive and offensive use of power in order to control people and make them submit. All under the guise of AML/KYC laws which "protect" some contrived entity. In the same way that drug laws are justified to protect people, despite the blatant untruths and hypocrisy...
Thanks for your response, I'm just venting at this point. I would love to speak with a cognizant, free-thinking human associated with Poloniex, but I'll likely just get a hierarchical reiteration of some policy; ergo, a drone just "doin' their job".
No taxes, no king, no borders, no state.
\*\*PEOPLE\*\* are what's real. \*\*LOVE is real\*\*. And these faceless machines are sucking the soul from anyone who willingly conscripts themselves to injunctive/imperative clauses. I'm not a robot that will perform a task and take a selfie for a centralized power institution who has hijacked my own currency and now claim it's theirs.
Who defends this shit??

The Poloniex platform was a way to access other cryptocurrencies. It wasn't used as a hot wallet. 
It was a bait and switch. They generated trust and goodwill, an ethos of freedom, and then gradually locked up everything from their customers. 
It's actually kind of sad. No one likes losing access to their funds, but I mean sad in a way that people are enacting infrastructure that impedes freedom. The bitcoin space is about borderless technology that facilitates cooperation in place of competition, decentralization in place of top-down control. 
I feel like I'm in an Orwellian nightmare. Brave New World.

That's what's up! New abundance in this community can and will be used to better the world around us. Currency is our electrical current - energy flows where attention goes. Dreams become actions become reality. Thanks for posting.
