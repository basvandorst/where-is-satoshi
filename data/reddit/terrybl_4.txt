No, your Difficulty Increase/Month is still way off.  It has averaged more like 30% per 10-12 days [since June]( (scroll down to "Difficulty History")...which is about 100%+ per month.  No one knows what that number will actually be going forward, but your 15%/month is incredibly unlikely.

So this actually happened earlier this March and was somewhat eye-opening to me.  It's not individual miners that 'vote' as much as the people in charge of the major pools.  [Here is the bitcointalk thread]( if you want to kind of overhear the discussion as it happened.  And [here is a chart of the major pools](  It's unlikely, and I don't know the individual power-structure of the major pools, but there are a few people who have an incredible amount of power on which protocol is accepted.
If individual miners are on top of things and aware of what's going on, they can 'vote' by stopping mining or switching to a pool that they agree with.  But otherwise, on an ongoing basis they basically vote by proxy with whatever pool they are currently mining with.

If it were me and I wanted to completely cash out, I would research some of the largest bitcoin companies and approach them directly.  Some of them would like to keep a decent BTC balance for ongoing operations, and both you and them would probably like to cut out an exchange middleman.  I would also probably prefer getting a contract and cashier's check from a funded company than to trust an exchange.

The 'Download' button from his site in the default "Today's show" tab downloads an .mp3.  His call starts at 68:10.  (The streaming player didn't seem to allow fast-forwarding, for me at least).
