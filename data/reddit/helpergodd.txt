Why is bitcoin core ignoring this from the creator of bitcoin himself? A simple fix to the blocksize issue which has been causing these nonsense debates. This could have been implemented by core a long time ago and would have made confirmations time much quicker and of course a big reduction in transaction fees, just as bitcoin was meant to be.
"It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade."
