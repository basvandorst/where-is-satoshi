you are just speculating without proof. please don't parrot the wired article or what others said in forum, because i'm pretty sure a tin-foil troll and regular schmuck like you get your information from. 
  
SHA-1 is compromised, so far no evidence shown there is collision with SHA-2. regarding Dual_EC_DRBG, while its nature can be dubious, yet SHA-2 is being examined by non-NSA researchers have yet detected ANYTHING. if worst case come for SHA-2, the Amsterdam paper at  ( described an alternative way of securing the hash function. 
if you are still not convinced, you should remove that tinfoil head of yours once in a while for fresh air, and compile the Bitcoin codes along with its usage of SHA-256 for yourself and generate the hashing function and check out the debug.log . maybe, just maybe, if you squint hard enough, you will see the word "schmuck" appear in those hashes...

it's open-source code written in C. i hope you know what open-source code means. 
codes here :   , 
edit: ugh, have enough of the net, i'm done for the day..

if you do provide evidence, please do so, but don't name-calling or personal attack random person on the net. SHA-2 families (SHA-256) has not been compromised yet. Also scroll down and check the table "collisions found" on SHA-2

this is some b.s he pulled. let's spread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt).

someone should wake the sheeples at . regarding QuarkCoin, you can always fork it.

volume trade does not mean much if 30.26% of all Quarks owned by 27 wallets. well if you put a curve on top of it, it does look like a cyclical pump and dump graph.
