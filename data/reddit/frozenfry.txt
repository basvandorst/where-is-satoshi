Why would you steal something that will be worthless?

I agree that a large amount of Bitcoin nodes in the same datacenter increases the risk that a single entity (-&gt; Choopa or AWS) is able to shut them down at once - probably with little to no notice.
I don't understand how you suggest to counter that **risk** by actually blocking them and thus shutting them down **for real**?
This feels like burning down all houses made of wood only because they might catch fire more easily than others in the future.
Also we should make the same assessment not only about the same physical datacenter, but
* 1. Geographic diversity
* 2. Bandwidth providers
* 3. Internet backbone Tiers / routes
* 4. Number of controlling entities
* 5. Risk of controlling entities to be malicious
* 6. Operating system stability, security, updates schedule
* 7. Expected response time for emergency updates
* 8. ...
There are a number of entities involved that brings you your Bitcoin peer connections.
Netflix and others use Amazon AWS to provide reliable and fast services around the globe. Of course, Amazon AWS could just pull the plug and Netflix would be down for good. But that is **extremely** unlikely. I think the same kind of risk assessment is needed for running Bitcoin nodes in the cloud.
Hashrate distribution and votes are important right now. The number of nodes does not pose a thread to anyone.

The increasingly toxic atmosphere in this subreddit is fueled by comments like yours.

You are completely right.
Bitcoin has value because users believe them to. If large number of users lose faith in miner's actions they might switch to altcoins and thus decrease the value of bitcoin, which might create pressure on the miners to act differently.
Still, the only voting method available to us not susceptible to sybil is PoW which leaves us with the miners as the only voters.

Thank you for the detailed explanation.
Could miners with less hashrate counter this kind of attack by mining smaller blocks? As long as the number of smaller blocks &lt; (current median) equals the number of bigger blocks &gt; (current median), the median won't shift. Of course this would mean that a larger number of smaller miners would have to create the same number of blocks as fewer bigger miners.


Agreed, but wouldn't that apply for the "other" side as well to push the median down? Would you argue for another scaling factor? 1.25, 1.5? (this numbers are awfully close to the blocksize debate in general)
Would it make sense for smaller miners to update their "blockmaxpercentage"-option accordingly to end up with a "fixed" blocksize limit that is &lt;= the blocksize that they can deal with?
Would you agree that it is okay to vote for blocksize using hashrate at all? 
Also, at some point, the increased blocksize will probably drive out some nodes and miners - we usually don't worry about those miners that are left behind due to difficulty increases, maybe this is a notion that will be applied to nodes and blocksizes as well in the future?

I'm not sure I follow, could you give an example?

In the heat of the current discussion we should not focus on authority. You can dismiss ideas without resorting to personal attacks.
@_date: 2016-03-23 12:50:42
**The number of nodes is not involved in any vote.**
No vote -&gt; no attack vector for manipulating a vote.
You should be concerned about miners: one block - one vote.

The author seems to be concerned because:


Although I agree that more people running nodes is better for Bitcoin, the handful of miners controlling &gt; 50% should be more troubling.


Seems to be good enough for Netflix.
