Near instant?  Cash is instant.  Credit Cards take seconds.  Bitcoin takes **10 minutes** for reasonable confidence in transaction validity.  No one is going to wait 10 minutes to buy coffee and a donut.  Not to mention, in that 10 minutes, the exchange rate could swing $10 USD.
No restrictions?  You still gotta get cash into the network somehow, which is a basic bottleneck.  And if the market gets big enough, you can bet regulators *will* get involved.
Not only are fees high, for typical payment processes on the merchant side, the aggregate in fees (ie, BTC transaction fee (which will get *very* expensive if BTC hits those $1000+ numbers people are dreaming about) + payment processor fee + exchange fee) is *higher* than Paypal or CC processing.
And we haven't even gotten to the scalability problems.  The blockchain is already huge... at this rate it'll become rapidly unmanageable.
The latency and scalability issues mean it's totally unsuited for high volumes of transactions, meaning, in its current form, it can never compete with credit cards or similar payment technology.

TIL bubbles can only happen to stocks.  I guess that whole tulip mania-thing wasn't a bubble after all!  Lucky!

And you know this how?  All the other exchanges are currently trading at or below 90 and have been crashing all morning despite Gox being out of the picture.
Maybe a cigar is just cigar, and a bubble popping is just a bubble popping.

And for every one of those "millionaires" there are a ton of losers.  This is a zero sum game at the moment.  That money came out of someone's pocket, they just aren't posting here about it.  It's just wealth transfer from the unlucky and stupid to the lucky... and probably stupid.

I know, right?  Suggesting that people frenetically buying into a speculative bubble might be stupid?  *Oh!  The humanity of it all!*
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:20:55


You miss my point.
*Unless the merchant waits for network validation, they cannot know if the coin has been double-spent*.
That means you *have* to wait those 10 minutes unless you're willing to take that risk.

You need some way to convert BTC on exchange A to a currency you can use to buy BTC on exchange B.  That could be USD, CAD, EUR (or even other virtual currencies like LTC), but that's the basic setup.  But depositing and withdrawing funds on *any* exchange, today, takes hours to days, which destroys any arbitrage opportunity thanks to current market volatility.  As it stands right now you'd need to be able to perform those transactions in seconds or minutes to take advantage of arbitrage between exchanges.  It's just not workable.
Now, if you could quickly electronically transfer funds directly between exchanges, that'd be something else entirely.  But that's not possible today.

@_date: 2013-04-10 23:34:26


Look at you, hating freedom... ;)
Incidentally, these kinds of shenanigans are only possible because of the low market volume.  If volume were higher no one individual would have the power to move the market the way they can today.
'course, until then, it'd behoove the exchanges to put in some kinds of controls to rate limit algorithmic transactions (and I'm sure some do, I've never deeply investigated their APIs).
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:58:23


The difference is CC companies act as agents for dispute resolution.  No such thing exists for bitcoin, today, and such an entity sounds an awful lot like centralized authority, which flies in the face of bitcoin's philosophy.


You have a very narrow view of what people are hoping to get out of bitcoin.
If the goal was simply to transfer sums of cash from A to B you'd be right.
But that doesn't make it a *currency*.  All that does it make it a wire transfer mechanism.  Useful?  Absolutely!  But I doubt any bitcoin fanatic would call that the endgame.
If you want it to be a *currency*, I need to be able to go to a store and by a coffee with it, and bitcoin's latency makes that impractical.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:22:01


So... fix the fucking exchange?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:21:43
Ripple only addresses the issue of exchange scalability, which, tbh, I consider a minor problem relatively speaking.
The transaction latency and network scalability issues are inherent in the bitcoin protocol.

I actually don't think it will... my guess is that the price will collapse down to, oh, $10 or so?  Then level off at the pre-bubble price, around $20 a pop if my memory serves.  That value is supported by BTC true believers who won't get out regardless of what's going on, combined with *actual* fundamentals (ie, the very small but burgeoning *actual* economy building up around BTC).


ROFL, yeah, it's been a spectacularly interesting morning... :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:34:17
Yes... MtGox... I'm going to trust their analysis of the crash, a business whose success is pinned on the apparent success of bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:46:18


And then I can trivially double-spend with a conspirator and then take off while one of the transactions is invalidated.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:48:53
It's not even that... A prisoners dilemma presumes a way for everyone to win.  But bitcoin is a zero sum game.  Someone has to lose eventually.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:21:11
There's a lot of early adopters who'd be interested in gaming the market.  Not to mention the exchanges themselves are *very* interested in seeing bitcoin pumped up.  And then there's the chance of attracting organized crime...
Make no mistake, BTC market manipulation is a *very* real possibility.

@_date: 2013-04-10 23:32:26


Nope.  You can't convert BTC &lt;-&gt; USD fast enough to set up a workable arbitrage system.

If Gox were the only market you'd be right.  But market participants are going to be using other exchanges as a signal for the value of BTC, and right now those other exchanges are trading at or below $70.
Mark my words, Gox is going to *implode* tonight as people try to liquidate their positions.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:50:46
It doesn't matter what it *can* be be.  What matters is what it is today.
Today, betting on bitcoin is a very simple zero-sum game.  You buy bitcoin, and then you wait and hope someone dumber than you will spend more money than you did on those bitcoins.  When the game ends, money has been transferred from the losers to the winners, where the money the winners "earn" is precisely the money the losers spent.  Period.
While I wouldn't call this a ponzi scheme, it is *absolutely* built on the [greater fools theory](  It is simple, basic wealth transfer.  That's it.  That's all.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:58:34
Huh... I admit, I hadn't considered doing it that way... if A is trading at $20 and B is trading at $10, place a sell order on A and a buy order on B, then transfer the BTC from B to A and repeat.  Eventually you'd be able to pocket the difference.
Yup, I take it back, there is an arbitrage opportunity there.
That said, you'd be limited by the amount of funds you could commit to B at any one time... and given how slow it is to get funds into the exchanges, that might limit the effect arbitrageurs could have on leveling the exchange rates.  But that's just a guess on my part.

To quote Edna Krabappel:  Hah!
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:25:18
Yeah, but it's not clear how much of that is based on simple psychology.  The fact is MtGox is the market maker at this point, which means that people look to it for a cue on what bitcoin is "worth", and that would explain why the exchanges seem to be *relatively* similar (although it's not unusual to see spreads between them... though how much of that is a real spread and how much of it is a product of laggy trading platforms is unclear).
After all, the value of BTC is only what people *think* it is... so if any one entity can control what people think, they control the market.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:31:15
Absolutely.  The exchange is the weak point.  If you can perform all of your transactions in bitcoin (ie, the real dream of a true currency with a marketplace), anonymity is suddenly quite possible.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:54:46


Yeah... translation: the price isn't based on fundamentals.
But I'm sure you knew that.
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:44:36
What?  No, that's called an arbitrage opportunity!
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:51:06
And on the plus side it makes it way easier to continue fleecing rubes so you can pump-and-dump!  Tell people something went from $30 to $300 in a few weeks and they might realize something screwy is going on.  But tell them it went from $0.03 to $0.30 and suddenly it seems like nbd!  Sure, the percentage rate of change is the same, but the psychology of perception is completely altered.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:33:18
What, you didn't opt to post this when there was the rally back to $200?  What about the rally back to $150?  Or back to $120?  Will you post it again during the rally to $50?
Man... so much self-delusion...
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:31:14


Yes, and let's say unicorn blood goes on sale only in Bitcoins...
You can speculate all you want about what might happen in the distant future for BTC.  But that doesn't change the fact that right now, today, there are no fundamentals to support current valuation.  It's a bubble, plain and simple, as you freely admit.
As for "early" stage, you only need to see the graphs of BTC value to see this has been a bubble for weeks now... when will it pop?  That I don't know.  But the valuation curve has gone freakin' vertical.  If it isn't a bubble, I don't know what the hell it is.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:26:20
One word: Schadenfreude
I actually very much like the idea of Bitcoin.  As a concept, a virtual currency is very intriguing.  But it's also a lot of fun to laugh at stupid people, and this bubble has brought them out of the woodwork in droves...
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:58:49
Possibly?  Definitely.  Bubbles happened before, usually after BTC has gotten some level of media attention.  This one is just bigger than usual, probably because the media attention is bigger than usual.  But, like previous bubbles, a correction *will* come, and many people will unfortunately be on the losing side of this zero-sum game.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:58:03
I would if I had a reasonable balance of BTC, but I'm waiting a bit to see where the market levels out (for some definition of 'levels') before I start getting involved in earnest.
And, truthfully, it'll be a hell of a lot more interesting when Gox starts moving other cryptocurrencies and there's more volume to work with ('course, at that point it's likely the spreads will narrow and it'll no longer be worth it).
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:18:00


Some day, maybe.  Today, no, it's *impossible* to subsist solely or even partly on bitcoin.  But I don't think I needed to say that, I'm sure you realize it.
And when it comes to the speculators that inflated the buble, it is 100% the case that it is a zero-sum game.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:58:56
Oh, you're quite wrong about that.  Let's visualize this.  Let's say everyone starts with 10 BTC and 10 USD and then run through each stage in your scenario (in this chart, the first number in the tuple is BTC balance, the second is USD balance):
       Bob      | Sally    | Jim      |  Frank
    0. (10, 10) | (10, 10) | (10, 10) | (10, 10)
    1. (11, 9)  | (9, 11)  | (10, 10) | (10, 10)
    2. (11, 9)  | (8, 13)  | (11, 8)  | (10, 10)
    3. (11, 9)  | (9, 10)  | (11, 8)  | (9, 13)
So what do we have at the end?  Well, as you'd expect, it's still 40 BTC.  No new BTC entered the system, and it's closed, so it's a zero sum.
What about USD?  Hey look!  Also $40 USD!  Why?  Because it's a zero sum game.
Oh, but you say, the market went up!  Those BTC are in fact worth more!  Well, yes, except the only way to realize that wealth is to extract is in the form of USD.  But that requires a buyer.  Let's call that buyer Bill.  Let's say BTC goes up from $1 to $3, and Bill buys everyone's BTC at the new normal.  What happens?  Below we have the total wealth transfer:
    Bob: +33
    Sally: +27
    Jim: +33
    Frank: + 27
    Bill: -120
Can you guess what the sum total is, here?  Obviously it will be zero.  *Because it's a zero-sum game*.  No wealth is being created or destroyed, here, it's just moving around.
Oh, but bitcoin went up!  It's at $5 now!  Obviously Bill made money!  Oh, but again, to realize that gain, he must find a seller willing to spend $5 on those bitcoins.  Again, this simply transfers the wealth from this new buyer to Bill.
The problem is you're pretending the "net worth" of these participants is the face value of BTC based on some USD exchange rate.  But that "net worth" means nothing unless you can actually get those USD, and that means you gotta transfer wealth from someone else.
The only way this stops being true is if you can get paid in BTC, buy products in BTC, get a home in BTC, etc, etc.  At that point, wealth, in the form of products and services, *is* being created, and it's no longer a zero-sum system.  It is, in fact, an economy.  But BTC ain't there yet, and won't be for a long time, if ever.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:39:19
Personally I say you just use MAX() to determine the value!  What could go wrong??
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:26:13
That's right... It's used to transfer value to fools from greater fools.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:40:00


Bullshit (sort of).  Move the trading engine to a closed network so it's not affected by DDOS.  Then geographically distribute the frontend (edit: in fact it looks like they may already be doing some of this for the frontend... maybe).  Yes, a determined set of hackers can absolutely DDOS that, but it's harder, and at least trades will still get through without delay.
On top of that, rate limit algorithmic trades to prevent the kind of trading engine flooding we've been seeing.  And on the manual side, require email confirmation of trades before adding them to the book (which prevents simple screen scrapers from executing automated trades).  Note, they may be doing that already, I'm an interested observer, I've never traded on Gox and don't plan to.
And those ideas are just off the top of my head.  I'm sure if you were thoughtful about it there's far more they could be doing.
Basically, architect for this.  But that requires, like, a knowledgeable systems architect, and somehow I don't think MtGox has one...
