you can track transactions. you just can't track the wallet address. Nor associate a wallet address with any individual. Unless they of course give it up.

I would do:
1) What is Cryptocurrency mining.
2) What is Cryptocurrency trading.
3) Why is Cryptocurrency better?

The only thing you can trust in Crypto, is that there's someone at every corner willing to scam you of your hard earned money.

Bittrex. Maybe Poloniex.
But, rule  to 32 of Why Crypto Sux states.
Never trust Trading Websites. Never leave large quantities of crypto on trading website accounts. Never leave crypto of trading websites unattended. Ref: Mt Gox &amp; Mintpal

LocalBitcoins is safe but costs a bit more.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:52:26
Buy off LocalBitcoins and have your bought BTC sent to an address generated by Bittrex.

Why Crypto Sux Reason 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:21:21
Unfortunately its not just Electricity you need to take into account. Electricity is a fixed overhead that is dependent on the power of the miner you buy/build. The main risky variable you have to prepare for is difficulty increase over time and value of each coin you are mining. On top of this is the impact that Bitcoin has on all Altcoins. Lots of variables. Lots of traps.

Reasons not to trust Crypto 
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:29:28
it is crazy. Crazy as day trading stocks. There is a risk with trying to make quick money. But in trading bitcoins and altcoins, there is opportunities to make some fast cash if you can teach yourself to be a smart trader. There is also a risk to wake up and find everything of value just dropped 95%

Lots of talk of problems with Kraken transfers. I’d avoid that place.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:24:41
China won't ban Cryptomining. They are the primary global investors in not only producing mining hardware but also mining the coin itself. It would be like cutting off the hand that feeds you.

Bought some Asiacoin while trading, price fell and then bottomed out. Bought some more asiacoin at bottom. Then Asiacoin scam went down, trading stopped and lost the lot.
Reinvested in Mintpal, started building up portfolio, then Mintpal scam hit and lost the lot.
Sold my gridseeds and packed away my GPU miner.
Fuck this shit.

The more bitcoin, the more transactions. 
The more transactions, the more individual fees.
The more individual fees, the more money available for mining.
The more popular bitcoin is, the more bitcoin value increases.
The more bitcoin value increases, the more transactions.
The more transactions, the more fees.
The more fees the more money available for mining.

You're better off just buying Bitcoins and holding onto them until their value increases.

I logged onto a crypto-exchange yesterday that I hadn't been on for 4 years. My account was still there. I was able to logon using my email address from back then and recreate my password via that email address. I found out from the transaction history on that website that I have bought .45 of a bitcoin. It only cost me $400. I had also left the remainder of 2 cents in the website. But the history was all there.
Now if your friend did buy some coins. Get him to go through bitcoin exchanges and shops which he might remember and logon. It might still be there.
And if he finds his treasure, don't forget what good ole Dark1tect did for you both.

Buy a bank safe box and put it in there. Write a will and certify contents to your parents if you dieded.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:44:33
please tell us how much it was. I 'm dying to know. I love to hear great fortune fall upon others. I too am sorry for your loss. I lost both my parents within 2 weeks of each other so I know how you feel. All they left me was a ton of their debt to pay for. lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:17:28
Yep Coinbase is fucked at the moment. They haven't been able to verify my id too. I closed the account. Use local bitcoins instead.

He is right unless of course their will nominated you as the Executor or you apply to the court to act as the Administrator. In which case all their items of value will combine to form the Estate and the Estate is used to pay off all Debts in a specific order. Taxes, funeral costs, secure debts, unsecured debts etc.

Unless BTC continued to rise and say in 12 months it doubles, then the 0.25 BTC you held instead of spent was worth twice as much. Welcome to volatility. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:52:49
Correct. You are only legally required to pay off those debts yourself if you are written into the contract with your parent/s. Morally it’s also a nice thing to do.

And in summer the heating added will need to be offset by an air conditioner. More heat, more air conditioner, more costs ( overheads)

2014 Bought some bitcoin, built an open case miner, mined some Dogecoin. Traded it up on Mintpal (you can tell where this is going). Dumped the lot into Asiacoin as it was looking good. Then the Asiacoin scam hit and I lost the fucking lot. Reinvested, started trading again and Mintpal scam hit. Lost the fucking lot.

HODL. Hold On For Dear Life.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:03:06
Yes. But as DarkMatter007 said, difficulty could rise and it might take you much longer to earn that 0.8BTC. And next week BTC could fall drastically in price and that 0.8BTC you earnt in a year was worth 5% of what it would have been worth if BTC remained at the level it was now. Again that volatility risk can hit from many directions in this game.
