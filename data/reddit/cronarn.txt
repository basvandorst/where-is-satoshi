The environments completely changed - Coinbase have paused transactions, the fees are too high, you’ve got insider traders happening to boost bcash, the miners completely control the price and the moment it becomes unprofitable to mine watch how the system collapses. 
Even the owner of fucking lite coin said he sold all his coins - you know that currency is screwed. 
As much as I love the concept of bitcoin and its ability to revolutionise the way we consider currency there’s too many issues with the crypto itself. 
I hope for the best - I honestly do, I couldn’t be more happier to hear people are able to make profits off it, but the whales and the big fish control the market and when they decide to jump ship it’s you guys who pay the price.

I imagine it was a combination of people not willing to part with bitcoin, the unregulation of the currency, and the difficulties within the trading process

Guys seriously sell - I know it’s hard to convince you, but sell. This is more then just a dip - it’s going to continue to tank.

How? If you mean it’s as factual as a mystic predicting the end of the world it’s really really not.
