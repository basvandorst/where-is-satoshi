Rightttt hahahaha thanks
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:16:51
wait...where was this from again? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:03:59
5) buy more
which is what I just did
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:29:18
it's called having a personality 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:42:34
I have used bitcoin.tax to calculate my capital gains for the year. It was easier than I thought... If you haven't made many trades that triggered taxable events, you should be able to figure it out (tax event = crypto to fiat / crypto to crypto)
You can either import trade data directly from the exchange (I've done this with gdax, coinbase, and binance) or if you don't trust the site, you can enter trades manually.
I'd recommend importing/inputting ALL trades (including fiat to crypto) and saving the records just so you have them
Hope that helps
EDIT: Forgot to mention, the site also allows you to choose your method of calculating cost basis (lifo, fifo) - but keep in mind, that whichever one you pick, you have to stick with it indefinitely. The more traditional way is FIFO...first in first out 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:50:38
The right answer is 1 and 4. I'm only doing 1... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:20:15
not sure if I'd call a 50% drop just a dip...
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:45:11
I'd say... in our life time, not impossible... but improbable
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:39:21
I shat my pants, took a breather, and bought some more
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:05:30
I understand that my man. Read the question
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:11:53
What would be the benefits of using HIFO as opposed to FIFO ? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:43:09
Yeah, I'm curious about that too. I use turbotax as well, i think they will add something for crypto gains/losses this year.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:53:02
You're welcome
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:52:44
it's basic supply and demand... but because of the recency of the technology and given that it hasn't fully developed or gone mainstream... we're still in price discovery. The price will be crazy volatile until we find a good equilibrium. Futures are a good start to finding that price point where supply level and demand level meet. We are still long ways to go though
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:29:36
technically, you'd be breaking the law 
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:12:59
I'm not quite there yet.. I don't panic when the price drops, but I cannot help myself from checking price. I tried for a whole week, it felt like a year 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:18:17
Just a piece of life advice buddy... next time, if you think someone is mistaken, at least offer up an explanation instead of just pointing something out to make yourself feel better. It'll go a long way and you wont look like a douche.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:38:46
That's what I was curious about. So I guess once you make the choice, you gotta stick with it year after year... so as a hodler who believes the value will go up, I'm better off sticking with FIFO... is that right?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:03:17
I just bought some 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:38:04
Rule  does not apply in the US... unfortunately, spending crypto is considered a taxable event
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:57:48

For simplicity's sake... sigh. Some people...
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:33:08
Will this recover all the coins in the trezor (not just bitcoin)? as in... will the same 24 word recovery seed work to recover bitcoin in a bitcoin wallet, litecoin in a litecoin wallet, and ether in an ethereum wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:25:10
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:03:13
I stayed strong for a week and was expecting too much. The price has not changed much lol 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:28:49
yeah... that's what my conclusion was after some thinking... the only realistic way to solve this is by having the laws change, which in itself is a tough toughhhh task...
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:10:49
Nope... I kinda do remember now. I think I wanted to buy some back then but just never went thru with it. Crazy to think about where I would be now if I did... sigh

@_date: 2017-12-22 06:40:41
The scarcity is guaranteed by the code... I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you are not a programmer. 
As far as being an intrinsically worthless concept... so is everything else. Cash and gold are just, well...paper and metal.
Once something goes digital, it's extremely difficult to go back... think music, movies... now money.  As Andreas likes to say, bitcoin is the internet of money. What mp3 did to vinyl, and what netflix did to vhs... is what bitcoin is doing to money.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:33:40
This guy explains things extremely well - probably my 2nd favorite guy to listen to after Andreas. Unfortunately, he doesn't make any more videos... he probably hit the bitcoin jackpot
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:26:46
as long as you are ok with the price shooting up to 20K before the end of the year AND  paying income taxes on your gains... i guess it's a double edged sword.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:49:39
BCH does? I've heard Ver in interviews before, seems like he does make the distinction between Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash.
Do you have a link or something where he does claim bch is the real bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:20:48
i used to get excited about averaging 10% on my index funds... bitcoin completely spoiled that for me
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:05:33
Lol some people...
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:08:16
so if I bought $100 worth of bitcoin, and my account is worth $500. Then I sell everything... I only get taxed on $400. Is this correct?

It's just a short term solution to a long term problem... 
You can't keep increasing the block size every time you run into scaling issues. I don't know what the long term solution is... but developers are working on the lightning network, which looks promising... but yeah, nobody trully knows

@_date: 2017-12-22 06:24:02
I'll throw in my 2 cents.
Bitcoin is a lot of different things to a lot of different people. It has the potential to be a currency, a commodity, a store of value, a bank, and many other things.
I personally see it as gold 2.0
If you look at gold, and the characteristics it has that make it a good store of value (recognizable, divisible, scarce, easy to transport, fungible, etc) , and then compare it to bitcoin... well, bitcoin objectively does a better job at being gold, than gold itself. This is a FACT, and most people don't understand this yet, but when they do... a lot of the market share will be taken by bitcoin, if not all...So, to put things into perspective: If bitcoin only takes 20% of gold's market, it would value 1 bitcoin at around $75,000 (assuming 21million circulating bitcoins). At 40% , it would double it to $150,000....  I believe this will indeed happen,  just not sure how long it will take...
So that's just the "store of wealth" potential bitcoin has... if it even touches/disrupts the other financial sectors... well, you can use your imagination... or actually crunch up the numbers. Either way, your mind should be blown.
Hope that makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:28:03
The blockchain technology can be used in many different applications. Currency is just one of them, and it just so happens that the first blockchain application was currency. 
So to answer your question...  you just agree with them

@_date: 2017-12-02 04:16:28

the whole point of blockchain is that it is self regulated and no one controls it. Sure, the bigger it is, the harder to control...  but that's the whole point, decentralization

sadly, this "us vs them" mentality is just harming everyone in the industry. Instead of focusing on the drama, we should focus on the technology and how to improve it.... we don't have to agree, and we can have healthy debate... but after spending some time here and on the BCH sub reddit, it's clear most people's priority is to take  "the enemy" down

As far as I know ... no. There's a certain level of randomness to this. Once a miner finds the solution to the math problem, their block and all its transactions in it gets attached to the chain. This means all the other miners' blocks (and all the transactions in them) get thrown back to the mempool. So if your transaction wasn't picked up by the winning miner, well... it gets thrown back into the pool. So you kinda have to win a "lottery" per se... Since there are so many transactions stuck, it takes longer to win this "lottery" . Hope that makes sense

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:29:32
nope, i've only invested in crypto what I could afford to lose, which makes it even more crazy... my crypto portfolio could go down to 0 and ill be ok. 
i wont lie, im tempted to take out some of my retirement money and put into bitcoin, but that would just be reckless...   
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:31:28
so every trade between any cryptos is taxable? It sounds like it would be a huge headache to be trading around ... a pain in the ass to keep track. How do people handle this ?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:38:16
Surprising how many people don't get the joke
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:48:27
Yeah... I think it's good that there is a community that supports bitcoin's vision, but I see a lot of people coming in just asking "how to get in" without really understanding what they are doing... and some of the advice given here is usually without a solid explanation... things like "buy now and hodl, buy the dip and invest only the money you can afford to lose" are good advice if you understand the reasoning behind it... but for new people that come in and just learn those things as a mantra... it worries me, it's almost cult like. I just think we should as a community, encourage critical thinking and some level of skepticism.

The profit is for sure enough for the amount of time and effort I put into it... but based on my own research and analysis, I see a ton of unrealized potential, hence the hodling. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:37:33
Are you in the US? How would you handle keeping track of every single trade you make? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:15
this is r/bitcoin, not r/psychic 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:07:32
if you zoom in on that first huge spike... it would probably look very similar 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:03:06
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:39:33
Thats the thing, i didnt buy yet. Im waiting for my deposit to clear to buy
@_date: 2019-02-04 19:09:31
goddamn... is there any service that does all this automatically when exporting straight from the exchange ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:29:04
this cant be healthy lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:35:16
How do you handle taxes on the gains when you sell?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:11:46
it doesnt feel real
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:04:34
How do you feel about owning 2
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:59:29
thank you, excellent video!
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:07:59
What's the "house money" mentality ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:47:39
deposit into my USD Wallet... FML
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:24:05
Nobody truly knows, but it definitely feels revolutionary... I guess that's what drew me in at first. 
And no, I haven't lost any money. Where do you see that? I technically haven't made anything yet since I have just been buying.... but the urges to sell for a big fat profit are becoming harder to resist... m u s t ....h o d l....
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:46:26
Never been a social media type of person
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:34:02
For sure! but lately i've been contemplating taking money out of my retirement account to invest in bitcoin. fuck, this is so sick lol 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:50:47
lol I'm just a stage 1 addict... im scared... must... hodl... 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:02:38
bro, just leave the trezor at home lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:08:31
Haha that's what I thought too...
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:59:17
thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:59:51
What happened?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:43:33
That's exactly the reason... I feel like the rise was too sudden and abrupt, based mostly on speculation/. That's why I'm wondering if I should pull out my original investment before a big correction...
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:39:50
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:56:56
That sucks, sorry about that. At least you learned a valuable lesson
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:26:49
omg it gets worse... lol 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:47:49
You must be doing very well for yourself
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:31:10

@_date: 2017-11-18 20:01:28
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:52:49

Funny, those are mi actual initials
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:48:53
I did instant buys in the past, but I just figured... after an ATH, im sure not much will happen... oh how wrong i was
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:43:06
lol let's just hope for a happy ending...
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:50:02
that's how i did it before, but i figured... it's just a week... i mean, who could have expected +3000 in a week? that's fucking insane
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:16:46
aint that ironic
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:13:09
Also... from what I understand then, it would be useless to have both a hardware wallet and also store the private keys online, since they would be storing the same key. So if someone hacked and accessed my online keys, they would be in essence also getting the private keys stored in the hardware. Is this correct? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:32:42
that was my original plan... unfortunately I broke one of crypto's golden rules and have invested a bit more than I could afford to lose.. so as soon as I hit that 1 year mark and I can avoid short term cap gain taxes , I'm taking most of my original investment out. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:10:42
Thanks so much, I think I understand it a lot better now. So let's say I bought bitcoin using Coinbase, and I decide to store the private keys using hardware such as Trezor... then how would I go ahead and transfer the keys into the hardware, and get em removed from Coinbase's database?
