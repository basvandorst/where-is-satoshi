Thank you! To be completely honest I am feeling a little uncertain about the whole thing. It may just be because cryptocurrency is an entirely new topic for me, but I'll keep researching.

Okay, thank you for the information. This is incredibly helpful.

I'm sorry to ask a stupid noob question, but I just need to hear about security. So let's say I use coin base to transfer $500 USD into bitcoin, and then I keep that in a digital wallet with coin base. Additionally, let's say I use two factor authentication with Authy and a strong password. If I do all of that, what potential risks still remain? Hypothetically, if my coinbase account were hacked could my bank account information be taken? I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, I am very new to investments and cryptocurrency, I just want to know how safe this is.

Understood, thank you very much.

Sounds perfect, that's what I want to hear. Also just to confirm, hypothetically, if the exchange did get hacked, there would be no ability to take from my actual bank accounts, correct? However, they would be able to take my bitcoins if my wallet on CoPay were hacked (which seems unlikely based on your description of it). Sorry for stupid questions, just trying to understand.

No offense taken, you may be right. Really I'm just trying to gain an understanding of it.
