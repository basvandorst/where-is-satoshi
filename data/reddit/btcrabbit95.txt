how do we know it's not a spam ?

Seem like you are mining with CPU/GPU which is no longer relevant today. with 4Mhz you will earn 0.00000444 a year. that's 1 cent in 10 years.
Your miner doesn't even register as a noise on Slush ... it's too slow.

copay works the best for me. It's like breadwallet but with BTC option! breadwallet dev team is retarted... try to convert bits in your head.

Hate to say it but their website is down now.

why would I pay $700 for $500 ?!?
@_date: 2016-06-09 17:59:35
very well done. I was surprised as well.
@_date: 2016-06-26 02:22:34
I don't see any of that. I see $20 for $30 that's crazy!!

copay is the next secure wallet and offers you more features then breadwallet. It's using their servers for blockchain walks and alerts however private keys are stored locally only. You can also configure it to display BTC vs bits which annoyed the hell out of me with breadwallet.

Thats not the case at all. Just wanted to show Bitcoin help me.
Feel free to delete it. I don't really care.

After you delete it please call the hospital I mentioned and ask about Yoda.

Yes, any help would be great. No one is forcing anyone to donate.
You would understand if you had a real bond with an animal.
