So all in all, they way your transaction would look in the Blockchain:
Exchange [Send 50 BTC] -&gt; Your Bitcoin Address/Wallet  [Send 50 BTC] -&gt; Some Stranger
They have the address of Some Stranger so it only takes like 5 seconds to see that your address sent Some Stranger 50 BTC and the Exchange Address sent you the 50 BTC you used to send to Some Stranger. Just a matter of asking the Exchange for the account that ordered the 50 BTC.

How close would it need to be?

Well actually your two posts are completely different. His title is just being honest. Bitcoin is booming and people get new customers easy by saying that they accept it here. is just saying the truth even though everyone knows that (nothing wrong with that). You on the other hand are just making a post to complain about your other post not getting upvotes. Two very very different things.

If only DDG wasn't so.. inaccurate (in my experience at least, I really wanted to love it) :(

Yeah sorry, I was being a bit lazy. Thanks :)

Well OP is boasting unmatched customer service because it is just him. He will lose his advantage with growth.

I probably confused myself. Messed up my edit and made a second comment.
They could figure out who person 2 is through the fact that the 50 BTC are tainted. So here is a scenario:
Say the illegal thing that some stranger did was sell drugs. They get busted because they sell drugs in person (as opposed to over the internet through something like SIlk Road). Just as it would normally happen, but the dealer just happens to accept payment in Bitcoins not dollars.
The DEA/Police have taken all Some Strangers electronic equipment (computer, phone, usb drives, etc.) and know they have his Bitcoin Wallet. Encrypted or not, doesn't really matter, access to the actual wallet doesn't matter. They know public Bitcoin Address. They type that address into blockchain.info and they can see all the address of people who have sent Bitcoin to Some Stranger, including the 50 BTC you send for your drugs. One way they could figure out who YOU are from that list of addresses who sent Some Stranger Bitcoins is check what addresses have sent YOUR address Bitcoins. If any of those addresses happen to belong to an Exchange then they have you. Say you didn't buy from an exchange but you are a Bitcoin Miner. If you use a pool service then they could ask the pool for the IP (or any account details like an email or even your name if you have to register) of the person who they payout bitcoins to.

Very interesting experiment. Curious as to why would you use 0.01 BTC for each account? That seems a little high knowing they are possibly going to be taken.
For the curious and lazy, here are the stolen addresses:

Thats pretty uncool not to have a sign. You are also putting ATM fees on your customers.

They require a trusted third party and only work within that third party. Coinbase has it, but only works with other Coinbase users.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:46:30
Totally forgot about difficulty. I understand what you mean now, sorry about that, you are completely right :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:17:06
I am not sure I understand what you are saying. 10 ASICs will be more energy efficient and generate more coins than 10 GPUs. Litecoin locks people into a more expensive, wasteful, and slower coin generation technique. This is also a problem because it makes mining unprofitable in countries where the cost of power is high. So entire countries could be rendered unable to mine coins (profitably) where an ASIC could mine more coins and use less power.


Really does not make much sense. That is not how it works at all. What you are saying is that this argument is invalid because people will use so many ASICs that it will use more energy than GPUs.
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:00:16
Forgive me if I am wrong, but I think this is a major problem with Litecoin. I understand that Litecoin wanted to use scrypt to make mining profitable for CPU miners so it would be more accessible but it failed. It does hinder ASIC/FPGA so people have to resort to GPU again. Which I think is a horrible compromise. GPUs use so more more energy (and generate a ton more heat) than an ASIC/FPGA. It is just a pointless waste of power to be forced on using a GPU setup when you could be using a much more efficient ASIC/FPGA one. I never payed to much attention to how a GPU setup works but I have built my own gaming rig before so I would also assume a good setup could cost more than an ASIC/FPGA setup. Greater power usage + multiple expensive GPUs + cooling + multiple motherboards for SLI/CrossFire.

Making a post to complain about not getting upvotes, really? Mods should really remove this post..

No, I think you guys are not understanding me. I don't care about its value or would have any intention of selling it again. I just want to touch it and lick it. That is all.

Seems a bit odd to force an ad redirection service on your help link.

If I understood what you said correctly:
From what you have said they know the public bitcoin address of the person who recived the 50 BTC (for the illegal thing). Just lookup that address on the Blockchain and they will see the public bitcoin address of whoever original sent you the 50 BTC which would be the exchange. Now its only a matter of asking the exchange "Could you send us the account information on the person who you transfered Bitcoin to at public Bitcoin address X?"
I probably misread your story so I am probably wrong, but it dosen't matter how many IP adresses you are hiding behind or where you generated the wallet. You could generate a wallet without being connect to the internet and someone could send that Bitcoin address money. You just wouldn't be able to do anything with it until you did connected to the internet. Also, the fact that every transaction in Bitcoin is public means that (for the most part) VPN, Tor or whatever is pointless. What you need is a mixing service. It will swap out your "tainted" (public Bitcoin addresses that have someone associated with them, like an Exchange) Bitcoins with clean Bitcoins.

Yeah but he is just complaining he didn't get free advertising like everyone else. Most likely because he is dealing with a very "niche" product(s). But complains anyway wondering why he is not getting any upvotes. Not trying to sound mean, but posts like these would ruin Reddit if everyone complained why their "picture of a cat is not on the front page even though I think he is the cutest in the world. WTF Reddit?"

I'm pretty sure someone did this in Roman times.. And all it costed was ownership of your house. Guy ended up owning pretty much all of Roman and being one of the richest people in history.
But then you can add other things like police to that list. Someone breaking into your house? No problem, just give me your credit card number and your 3 digit CCV and we'll send someone right over.

Well even if the dealer uses that Bitcoin Address for legitimate purposes and it is impossible to know why you actually sent the drug dealer Bitcoin JUST from looking at the Blockchain, the Police/DEA can check out every address who ever sent the dealer money and get as much information as possible on those addresses.
But its not really that big a deal. Bitcoin is anonomous if you want it to be. There are many things you can do to stay anonomous on the Blockchain.
Look up "Silk Road" if you have never herd of it. People literally buying drugs with Bitcoin over the internet and sending them through the mail. If Bitcoin is anonomous for drug dealers/buys (I know Bitcoin is not the only thing they use like Tor, just saying though), then you should be safe.
