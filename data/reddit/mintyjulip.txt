In response to the constant fear of gubmint intervention in the btc market. IMHO, if the _only_ purpose btc served was a very liquid store of value, entirely on the cash, back alley black market, with gubmint goons searching every hard drive, it will still continue to grow exponentially for quite some time.   My reasoning is that the magnitude of hot, scared, fraudulently obtained fiat is so large -- really in the 100s of trillions, _and_ banks and gubmints are so cash starved, again with real deficits in the 100s of trillions, that the tiny, tiny btc market is completely dwarfed by the size of the demand for a secure, offline and physically untuchable store of value.  There is simply no other asset that is not subject to capital control and physical confiscation -- and big, hot money is starting to really panic now.  Just my BTC 0.02.

great point.  does looking at ebay scores mitigate some of that risk in your opinion?

regulation is not good for btc or any other non-violent, non-coercive thing. regulation is force, used almost exclusively these days to give monopoly power to connected special interests at the expense of small farmers and bizfolk. lets let true market forces prevail for once ...

i agree that diversification is important if you are over invested in btc, but think getting into bankster theftable and gubermint confiscatable paper assets at this point in history is not well considered.  i'd go with guns, gold, cash and storable food ... probably all can be bought with btc and leaving no paper trail.

start small, build trust?
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:34:45
ok, got it.  thx!
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:33:50
love to know what i did to you besides give my honest advice.
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:58:40
the charge back does make it risky for seller, i didn't think about that!  of course, this just underscores btc's final transfer features relative to cc/pp!

have u ever had to bail with your ag/au/cu&amp;pb  b/c of flood, fire, moving, someone wants you dead? i have, several times.  thats when you realize how much ag/au/pb wheigh.  thats when you realize how really difficult it is to move them around in a hostile environment.  now add in capital controls, tsa, viper teams and crooked cops.  now add in desperate people.  think about trying to transport your physical wealth.  think about trying to trade that wealth for food or fiat in a crowded envioronment f2f.  can you prove you own your metals if you are caught with them?  do you have the paper work?  metals are a good *last* ditch, but the anonymity of btc gives you mobility with the 100% fiction of appearing destitute.

dude, what is your damage?

You may have selected the wrong deposit option in bitinstant.  This happened to me -- I think I accidently selected BitStamp and gave my wallet # as my ID.  It took some negotiation to straighten things out...  In the end, what worked was to not keep replying with the same bitinstant id # to the support folks.  You should use a fresh subject every time, otherwise it'll just go to back of file cabinet ... 
Good luck!

It took mybe 5 days?  They said they sorted it, then nothing...  I kept replying with stale subject line and no response.  Then, fresh subject line and imediate appology and quick fix.  They have all kinda mail filters I suspect ...
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:53:00
no, and why would you post it? i really was trying to help you. and why assume i did anything? i don't use mtgox b/c they don't allow tor proxy and onion is how i deal -- so there is no way i could have done anything.

I had same problem.  Using different amounts, ie 494 and 497 fixed it.  I would advise against using multiple names -- the moneygrams synch via your phone number -- different names/phone numbers could cause problems IMHO.

bitinstant -&gt; VouchX
VouchX -&gt; Vicurex
Does that count?
@_date: 2013-03-31 21:08:57
due diligence?  P2P reputation schemes?  kno the latter are not available yet ... 
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:18:41
accepted.  if you settle down and calmly deal with bitinstant, i really think you can save your situation.  just be patient with them, be optimistic and say please a lot ;)  worked for me...

i had a goldmoney turkey acct.  can u hook it up to a bank in s. am. ?  no...  its like filing for divorce with the paper work, and you can only use the bank you deposit from to get the money back out.  turk likes to talk about how phys he is, but really,  his model is like visa.  if you are happy with gold backed visa accnt, good for you.  personally, i don't trust anyone that doesnt trust *me* and what i want to do with my mullah.
