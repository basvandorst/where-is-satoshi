This is depressing. I don't know whether to up-vote or down-vote this. I hope whoever bought it at least paid for it in Bitcoin: )

I understand everybodies' rage but I thought it sounded as though rather than error by commission it sounded like error by omission the guy being  simply over his head (but hey what do I know).
 According to the podcast the exchange was never solvent. They tried to trade their way back to solvency but MT Gox kept getting hacked. The final blow was when he ran a trading bot that was supposed to earn millions but instead drove the exchange into the ground.
I would love to read a first class account of what really went on.

This is great 
If you want to earn some karma r/WallStreetBets would probably appreciate this.

Let's hope the Tokyo judge sees sense...
I guess a good U.S. Lawyer could also bring about a civil suit.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:59:54
Yep... If I was Mark I would pay off every Bitcoin I owned and then go into hiding for a long long time. The fixer in the last few episodes of *Breaking Bad* comes to mind.
What an interesting life Magic Tux has lead.

I am sorry to hear that and hope you get your coins back.
Further irony. If the Japanese courts do decide to return the bitcoins to their owners Marks clients may benefit from having their coins frozen (compulsorily hodled) and being able to cash out once the court case is resolved

It sounds like a fun project... I am sure you could sell these. Of course once you have a prototype it would be easy enough to program it to display any stock price / ratio whatever so the market would be bigger than the crypto world. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:35:48
Of course... I have no idea how these things work, particularly in Japan.
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:44:30
I hope not but stranger things have happened.
Edit: How is he keeping afloat at the moment? Japan is an expensive country and Tokyo is an expensive city. Also those lawyers can't be cheap.

Context is everything. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:04:58
I don't want to see Karpeles completely destitute but it would be beyond irony if the Japanese courts leave the customers to hang out to dry while they simultaneously make Mark a multi-billionaire.
Someone should be all over this for film rights. The Mt Gox story would make an excellent movie — something along the lines of *Rogue Trader*
You are right the centralized exchanges are a weak point. I wonder how many of them will remain solvent in the event of a major crash.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:14:00
And I thought Mark had simply invented the Mt Gox equivalent of fractional reserve banking. : \
I guess you are probably not supposed to run a bot in your own exchange hoping to front-run your customers either. Like I say I am profoundly ignorant but would love to read an in depth book about the affair.

Second that. they are getting a great education Also, *and this is a minority opinion,* when you are young, it is a good time to take on risk — If it all goes pear shaped there is still time to earn it back. 
I  hope they are prepared to ride the inevitable swings and not too many people get hurt when the great crypto-bubble of 2018 bursts.
The r/Korea sub is [mostly encouraging]( I would love to read an in depth article about the crypto-craze in Japan.

I imagine you are right. Having worked for four years to try to save a sinking ship I still feel sorry for the guy. The experience was an endlessly deepening sleep deprived nightmare that ultimately destroyed my health, my relationship and caused a mental health dx.
Of course Mark might be more robust than I was or he might simply be counting his ill gotten gains.

Given Bitcoin's global reach, and unlike other assets where price increases stimulate  production, Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary this ride could be quite exciting.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:55:43
I think the ride is just beginning.
If you look at [this graph] ( you can see we are at the point where the institutional investors are becoming interested.
Remember Bitcoin is a global phenomena. Also the amount is fixed; unlike other assets such as oil or gold price rises do not stimulate further production. 
Volatility is not going away so expect the ride to be a roller coaster.

I was  saddened to read a few days ago about a redditor whose [brother killed himself]( in part because of reversal in his financial fortunes. 
Could you consider making a small donation to [Maytree ]( They are run entirely by volunteers and are  one of the only places that offers sanctuary to actively suicidal people without all the stigma of hospitalization. Apparently they are highly effective in supporting people through their moments of crisis.
Thanks so much for your generosity.  I think however you might have destroyed your inbox.

*International News*.
I live in New Zealand and the house fire,  the resultant loss of your cats (and the Bitcoin reward) made the local press down here. 
I am really sorry you and your family had to go though this. I can't even begin to imagine how upsetting it must have been. I am glad that you, your partner and your friend made it out unscathed and that recovering  the Trezor meant  silver lining in a (very dark) cloud.
Thank you also for the work you do with the [Ferndale Car Shelter](

I found it interesting as well. They touched on such a range of topics all of which rightfully deserves a whole hour or so in themselves.
The power consumption prediction — that the computing power required to maintain the blockchain will (if current trends continue) use as much electricity as the entire United States — made me sit up as well. I realize LN will reduce this demand but it is still a startling figure. It seems to me POW, by its very design will always be inherently inefficient and this has always seemed to me to be a flaw in the heart of Bitcoin. Would love someone to prove me wrong. 
I really enjoyed the quote "Bitcoin is the gold standard on steroids" and also the discussion from the guy from Positive Money. The next few years are going to be extremely interesting.

Wow... Thank you (a million times)
Once an alternate universe a long long time ago I was (periferally)  involved in psychedelic research. Although I felt the work was important funding was always incredibly difficult as even the topic was taboo then. 
I really hope that your million dollars pays dividends in bringing peace to people's lives — a wave of good will flowing forward through time touching humanity in ways we have yet to imagine.
I am deeply moved... I'm going to bed now. Once again thank you...

Bedtime thought: Someone should give u/PineappleFund a million dollars because of his/her generosity. Wait... wait... something's wrong here : )

Pine is a hero of mine. After all the scams and rip offs he exemplifies the cryptocommunity at its best. I hope he inspires a few more whales to donate some of their earnings to charity.
Not a pineapple in sight but I notice one of Pine's donations was featured in an illustration heading an article about the recent meeting of the Satoshi Round Table. I guess philanthropy was discussed there.

Great news. A friend of mine is an old age pensioner. I  told him about bitcoins when they were 30 dollars or so. Unknown to me he decided to buy some. Several months ago he told me that he had become a millionaire. It has completely changed his life in the most unexpected direction.
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:42:33
Yep... Hope he Hodled and bought the old bank building.

You probably did better than the majority of professional fund managers out there.

You would have made money betting against me. I thought the price would continue to rise, fall back to about 20k again, then go up to 60k as institutional investors piled on board.
