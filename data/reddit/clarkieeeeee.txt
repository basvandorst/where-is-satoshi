Shit, you're right....Imma sell now.

Thanks bro! I’ve been called worse.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:41:59
Genuine question, where can you buy your groceries in BTC?? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:16:35
So if a block size increase is not the answer we want then what is ? The elusive lightning network? I bought my first bitcoin just over a month ago and plan to be a long term hodler. I don’t care that the price has dropped 5k recently it’s extremely healthy and was needed. But what concerns me is, what is the solution to stop the mempool being jammed full all the time?? We are obviously under attack..
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:27
So you put in an order to sell, they've cancelled them (last I checked it was over $100,000,000) and now you're just stuck with BCH till they decide you can sell even if you bought in @ $9500?!!?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:13
This is insane!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:40:33
I’m in the same boat, was kinda hoping for a dip to get a bit more but at the same time seeing it grow like this is insane. Really hope there’s not an opposite downswing though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:16
 Watch this video, he is clearly reading off a screen bumming up Mt.Gox a huge exchange that stole millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:54
What does that mean? that all the orders that were there (sell @ $8500) are cancelled??????!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:31:30
There's where the confusion is.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:43:50
Bittylicious.com never had an issue good prices during times of sideways movement in the charts. Prices not so good during volatile days. Quickbitcoin.co.uk also never had a problem and prices track the market almost instantly. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:19
Buy, hodl, go into crypto sleep come back in 5 years. Thank us later. No but in all seriousness only buy what you can afford to lose. Although I’m confident in BTC you never know what can happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:55
Why is it so high on coinbase and much lower on coinmarketcap.com ? This seems fucking dodgy if you ask me. Since crypto's arent regulated as such can anyone be held responsible for this obvious market manipulation? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:10:29
Hey man thanks for the explanation! Much appreciated! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:25:38
I was thinking the same thing, not sure where that info could be found... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:26
I agree its worrying, but what the fuck can you do, HODL? Sell? or just wait and buy when theres a correction? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:04
I wholeheartedly agree! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:00:53
I agree with Bluethunder here, it rose to 11.4k a few days ago and took a hit to 8k, before rising and holding at around 9.5 - 10k. Sure this is a decent run its been on the last 12 hours but we've seen this before after a correction....  
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:17:31

Can you explain why a bigger blocksize = loss of decentralization? I've heard people going on about it but no idea as to why it would cause that? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:54:41
Well, thats a constructive reply, that's more of what I was looking for....many thanks! 
But I'm just pointing out that wallet to wallet is shite at the moment, and when will Lightning Network be implemented and used widely by the community? Which I still can't seem to find an answer.....

What a muppet
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:54:35
I'm hoping its adpoted by all and I can actually use my bitcoin to buy things/holidays whatever just like actual currency. If in the next 5-7 years it looks it isn't going that way then maybe the best option would be to sell it (if its still in demand) and take the fiat for it.

I don't try and play the market. I've bought to hodl for the long run, talking 5-10 years. So even when its correcting I don't feel anything :)

Once they enable this (Which is a fucking joke having to wait for a company to "Enable" a market so you can sell when they want you to) Do you think this will be the big difference? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:43
Yeah I’m hodling for sure. I bought my first piece back in 30th or October and added here and there. I’m in it for the long run!! Good luck to you too!

Woooahh still going strong, here’s that “volume” Antonopolous was talking about ... 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:06:19
bittylicious.com or quickbitcoin.com, bittylicious is usually cheaper, but during times of high volatility quickbitcoin seems to track the price a lot better. I've used them both and both times the bitcoin has arrived no issues. 
Basically don't hold anything on an online wallet that you can't afford to lose. I personally don't hold anything on an online wallet. Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:33:45
Well good luck to the hedge fund manager telling his clients their money is out there somewhere “processing”

At the moment I've got 50% BTC and 50% ETH, I really like the prospects of ETH and what it could become in the future; Vitalik Buterin is a genius who I have faith in. I'm looking at 5-10 years, it all depends on when it seems to stabilise, and if its before then and I can quit my job I'll be very happy :)

Maybe so but they are one of the countries that are embracing crypto currencies. Look it up :) 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:43:23
To buy, bittylicious.com 
I've used them 5+ times and never had an issue, very fast bitcoins in the wallet! 
I don't trade just HODL :) 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:43:05
Good luck to you too dude! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:19
bittylicious.com never had an issue, look them up on trustpilot.com
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:31:21
That makes sense that they would do that, it's just worrying to see especially being relatively new to all this. Looking forward to getting my BTC on my hardware wallet very soon!! Thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:24:54
The recent hack mentioned today was to do with "USDT" or "Tether" another type of crypto - as far as I am aware the mention that the hacked funds were put into a bitcoin wallet was the catalyst for a dip in today's BTC price. 
As mentioned in previous comments, invest in a hardware wallet (Trezor is the one I use) and you'll be fine. 
Welcome aboard!

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:11:14
Apologies, bittylicious has limits to the amount you can buy per transaction, but transcations seem unlimited, so the more times you buy the more they trust you and up your transaction limit.

I got a little bit not long ago at around $8200, obviously wishing I'd bought more then but nevermind. Surely we're gonna see a dump after this latest rally in such a short space of time and be able to buy in lower? Thoughts??

@_date: 2017-11-21 09:19:41
Very early days still, I agree with Yimot, once the price stabilizes it will then probably see mass adoption, especially online (Amazon for e.g)
 There's still a lot of work to be done in terms of transaction fee's because they are quite high at the minute ($3 was my last) so the technology/developers need to find a way of lowering this (Segwitx2, lightning) but the community as a whole needs to come to a consensus. 
I could be speaking a load of shi*e here but that's the conclusion I've came to due to the research I've done.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:56:20
Same, just got all my crypto on my Trezor and will be loading when I can. 
Good luck us!! :)

Try on bittylicious.com I have never sold to them though only bought and it was seamless! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:54:05
Well I hold all my crypto on my hardware wallet "Trezor" but if I wanna sell I'd sell to the likes of bittylicious.com  or localbitcoins.com 
Good luck!

@_date: 2017-11-22 12:53:38
An exchange will always charge you more than the market rate for buying the bitcoins in the first place so yes, you will lose money instantly, but if you are as confident as you say you are in Bitcoin and as you say you can afford to pay the loan back should things go sour then it's pretty clear you are going to go for it. Is it that easy to buy them? yes. and you will lose money? yes - to begin with. 
If you want to cash out you will have to find an exchange/broker/lad down the pub who wants to buy them, and either take the hit due to bitcoin dipping or reap the rewards because the price is higher. 
Holding for the future is the best bet I'd say. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:40:33
Get a Trezor, cold store your crypto and HODL!! :) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:17:31
"Down for maintenance" gulp....
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:56:24
I read the article before it had been deleted.
It must of only been on here for minutes. Whoever you are, mentioning the $80,000 in debt you were in BEFORE you tried bitcoin is quite misleading. 
You actually lost $6300 due to playing with a loan from a bank? There's mistake number 2. The first mistake was getting a loan when you have $80k worth of debt UN-RELATED to bitcoin. 
If at-all true, you're right, it was your fault. Who knows what will happen in the future, and I can understand gambling to try and pull yourself out of a rut but you must stick to the advice of.... well I'm not gonna say it because you know the answer. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:37:37
Also not signing up to read it. 
After mentioning - "some enterprising chap in Lagos" which is borderline racist and "It can cost well over a tenner" That's all I needed to read.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:09:59
And why would that be? I'm new to the crypto world, all I can see is delays in CME futures and tethers hacked is this the reason for the slump? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:53:21
If your bank uses faster payments (direct bank transfers) its extremely fast. Once you get the "payment received" e-mail from bittylicious its usually in your wallet in 10-15 minutes. I did have to wait 4 hours once but I think it was my wallet provider that caused that. 
As for reliable I've used them 5+ times and never had an issue, just look at the reviews on trustpilot too. I tried a small amount first then went bigger the next time.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:53:37
I have not sent anything to those addresses.

I'd move to Japan if I were residing in the US and it happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:55:19
Just to clarify - because I had the same questions when I just started buying crypto. The coins don't actually reside on the hardware wallet, your private keys do, your coins themselves are stored on your public address which is backed up by the block-chain. YouTube video's from reputable sources are the best ways to learn about this. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:19:34
^^^^ That's why I went with them, and so far customer support has been excellent. I do have a hardware wallet, I have been away for work and not been able to use it yet. The plan is to get the BTC to cold storage as soon as I am can.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:28:37
Ok, I've bought bitcoin from an exchange, it's arrived in my online wallet (Cryptopay) you can see these transactions with the green arrow and green tab on the right with the amount in BTC or $. 
Then 2 days later the same transactions for the exact same amounts are "leaving" with my address on the left and a red arrow, then red tab "-0.15btc" and I haven't sent any bitcoin anywhere.... 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:49:25
Haha, true bud.. It just seems like the normal pattern after such a pump. I'm a hodler so regardless of when I get in, I'm in it for the long run and will hopefully reap the rewards of patience...
