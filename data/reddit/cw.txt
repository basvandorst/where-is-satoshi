What's the magic word?

Well, nothing, but still.
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:35:44
Sure why not

I'm curious- why are you so concerned about being a target of hackers or the mafia? I've been using paypal for a decade and Coinbase/exchanges for a few years, in each case rather willy nilly, and have never had any issues, not been concerned about any.

Lol right
This guy is not exactly going out on a limb

You're assuming his concerns are governed by reason.

He didn't mean like, actual corruption. It's bitcoiner slang for 'I don't like this'. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 05:20:25
You misspelled bitreserve :)

If you're going to allege that a federal judge is corrupt let's see some evidence or charges of judicial misconduct. Otherwise you're just another blowhard -- not to be taken seriously.

The article you linked says that Schumer called for feds to shut down SR. Nothing about a head on a platter, or even any arrests. Exaggeration undermines your point.

Or even thousands of users' info

Not sure what you're alleging, but cases in the SDNY are assigned to judges pursuant to their local assignment rules.
