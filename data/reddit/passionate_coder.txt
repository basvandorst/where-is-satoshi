A counter-argument to your "employee" example in the original post is that maybe the employee doesn't learn anything; maybe that employee screwed up because he's a negligent idiot and will never learn from his mistake.
I would rather go with an exchange that hasn't been hacked, has insurance, and uses cold storage. Whatever security measures Bitfinex has obviously haven't worked, so I have no reason to trust them this time.
We don't even know if it was an inside job, or if they've even found the cause of the hack, yet you're already willing to give them a 2nd chance? I recommend being more cautious, the Bitcoin space is filled with scams and dead promises.

Would it be a bad idea to NOT accept the longest chain if it rewinds more than 6 blocks?
A potential line of attack is that a powerful miner could mine multiple blocks in secret, then release it and destroy trust in multiple confirmations. If I were a financial institution threatened by Bitcoin, I would spend money to undermine people's trust in its immutability. If people don't trust confirmations after several blocks, that's significant problem.
What is the downside if we make nodes reject chains which undo too much work? Then I could be certain that 6 confirmations is 100% safe from modification.
I believe we had a checkpoint system before, but I'm not sure what happened to it.

What's the downside to ensuring that blocks are found closer to 10 minutes, by varying difficulty every second?
Meaning, nodes calculate the difficulty to be at its highest just after a block is found, and gradually gets easier as we approach the 10 minute mark. After 10 minutes, the difficulty keeps becoming easier to ensure a block comes soon.
This reduces the chance of blocks being found too quickly, and therefore don't contain many transactions, and reduces the chance of waiting an hour for a confirmation.
I know the difficulty retargets every 2 weeks to get a more accurate reading of the difficulty, but isn't this loss of accuracy worth more certainty regarding confirmation time?

I don't think I'm explaining myself properly :)
Your example of being disconnected from the internet won't delete my blocks, it will just append new blocks onto my short chain. I'll need to download new blocks to catch up, but the blocks that I had before are still unchanged.
The problem that I was talking about before was a miner actually modifying old blocks...meaning transactions that were confirmed for an hour might not be any more. Modifying blocks is what I was worried about, hence I asked about checkpointing to prevent it. There is no block modification when my internet cuts out, my old blocks stay the same...i just need to download some new ones.

51% attack only implies that a miner is abusing their majority by disabling new transactions. I'm talking about an even more powerful miner who secretly mines a large number of blocks, and then floods the network. We trust 6 confirmations to be perfectly safe, but a sufficiently powerful miner could suddenly undo it. 51% attacks are minor compared to this, because it'll only affect new transactions, not altering the history.
It would be worth the money if you were a billion dollar payments company threatened by Bitcoin. I'm not saying it's worthwhile yet, but if Bitcoin continues to grow we have to assume it'll be attacked at some point.


Inconveniencing people with no new transactions seems like a good trade-off for preventing multiple blocks being rewritten.
@_date: 2015-12-14 10:32:35
Reduce transaction sizes by 16%:
This is probably a dumb idea, but I wanted to get some input :)
If a user spends all Bitcoin from an address so that it now has a zero balance, what if we replaced the 72 byte signature with the Private Key?
You would need to do this after confirmation obviously to prevent double spends...but after the TX is confirmed, I'll just send the Private Key of the empty input address to other nodes. The nodes can verify that my Private Key matches the signature, and then replace their 72 byte sig with my 32 byte Private Key. No data is lost even if every node deletes the signature, because you can just calculate the sig with my key. This reduces disk space and every new node that comes online only downloads the 32 bytes instead of 72. No coins are vulnerable here because this method would only be used on addresses which are being fully spent, which happens to be the vast majority of addresses on the network.
Modifying the confirmed transactions won't affect block hashes, because if Segregated Witness is merged then transactions IDs don't hash the signatures, so converting from a sig to a Private Key won't affect anything.
Assuming an average transaction size of 250 bytes, this change would reduce disk space and bandwidth usage by 16% (40 bytes) for fully spent addresses.
This involves a bit more CPU usage to verify the Private Keys...but processing power is the resource we have the most of compared to bandwidth and disk space, so it seems like a good trade off.
Does this make any sense or am I crazy?

Makes sense. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-12-14 13:09:47


Can you please expand on this? Why wouldn't wallets choose to make signatures this way? 


True. However, address reuse is always discouraged anyway, so this shouldn't be a deal breaker. In fact some people would support blocking spends to spent addresses anyway, since both parties compromise their privacy. It would be a security upgrade to the network if we blocked address reuse.


I don't understand. Do you mean I need to prove that I'm going to publish my Private Key?
@_date: 2015-12-14 13:14:29


Yes, this is exactly the problem I'm talking about. I figured we could deal with this by telling nodes to not accept blocks that start too far back....so if someone tried mining on top of the 7th last block, they should have their blocks rejected.
I'm assuming there's a downside to this node policy, but I don't see it yet.
@_date: 2015-12-14 13:39:32
If everyone honest miner and node also rejects the block rewinding, then none of us will be isolated. 
If someone goes offline during this period, they would come online ad just pick the non-rewinding chain rather than the heavier chain.
@_date: 2015-12-14 14:08:34


But the network will never naturally split 7 blocks back...so that's how we can recognize a malicious miner.

@_date: 2015-12-14 13:27:37




If every honest miner and node had this new policy, we would still be the 'true' network, because the malicious miner would be mining irrelevant blocks. We would continue using the proper chain because we would reject the 7 block reorg.
I know that this wouldn't help against a miner trying to 51% attack the network and just mining useless blocks to disable the network...however at least it would help against rewinding confirmed transactions. 


Ok, thanks for explaining this.


Incentives only apply to people who are dependent on Bitcoin to function properly. We assume miners stay honest because it's the only way they make money. I'm not worried about miners that are dependent on Bitcoin, I'm worried about a financial institution in the future attacking Bitcoin by destroying trust in its immutability. Rewinding blocks is something that would destroy the Bitcoin economy, and a large corporation could have the incentive to do it if Bitcoin becomes more popular in the coming years.
Bitcoin's incentive system doesn't apply to other companies who profit from killing it.

If you ran a node with a ton of IP's, what negative consequences would that have? As long as you relay my tx, I don't see the problem. If you're saying that they're going to hoard too many transactions to get the fees, then I don't see the problem with that either. The node is being efficient if it can relay a shitload of the network's transactions, it should be rewarded for doing so.


That's already a problem today. You only have to bring a few thousand nodes online today to have a majority of the network. At least with incentives, people have a motive to let the network operate properly. They don't have much incentive right now. I would argue it's easier to get a majority right now than it would be if everyone started bringing nodes online to chase the profit. Then it would become much more difficult to obtain a majority.
@_date: 2014-11-03 14:24:03
Fair enough, but I suppose is that feature necessary? Without the balancing effort, we should still be able to store the full chain many times over by storing a random selection of blocks across thousands of nodes.
@_date: 2014-11-03 13:31:20
(Wanted to share an idea with you guys)
Increasing the number of nodes on the network:
The current problem with running a full node is the massive storage requirement. More people would run nodes if you could run it on the cheapest available VPS. Pruning the blockchain doesn't really help with this problem because choosing to store 5GB of data still only stores the most recent 5GB of blocks. Nodes storing the full chain will still be required, because pruners can't supply the older blocks.
My proposed solution is to be able to store block data for random blocks; eg, if I want to allocate 5GB for block data, a random selection of blocks are chosen to be stored. Assuming a large number of nodes all go with the random method, the probability of a single block not existing anywhere should be practically zero. This system would allow the network to function without anyone storing the entire chain.
Nodes could broadcast info to other nodes about which blocks they are storing, so when I'm downloading blocks from my peers who have incomplete chains, my peers can tell me which IP's to connect with to fetch the blocks I want. Nodes don't need to store the full chain, they'll know where to find the blocks that they don't have, and pass on this information to downloaders. All the nodes have to do is broadcast which block ID's they possess to other nodes on the network. A node could, for example, store IP-to-blockID correlations for 50 peers. So when I request a node for data they don't have, they can check their list of 50 peers to see who has which blocks, then relay that IP address to me so I can connect to them myself.
Better yet, it would be cool if instead of storing a random selection of blocks, a node could instead choose to store the least available blocks. The node could find out which blocks are less commonly stored (because random block selection doesn't mean even distribution of blocks) and then balance out the system by storing only those hard to find blocks. That would ensure all blocks are relatively evenly stored throughout the system. All the node has to do is query its peers on what blocks they're storing, then calculate which blocks are being stored the least, and go ahead and find then store those. Nodes could be regularly downloading and discarding block data according to which blocks aren't being stored, while always staying within the allocated 5GB (or whatever size). The added benefit of having blocks properly balanced throughout the network is that the bandwidth load on any particular node is low, because the load is being averaged out. Without this system, eventually nodes will prune their chains and the bandwidth load on complete nodes will just go higher and higher as less people store the oldest blocks (pruners will only have the newest ones).
What do you guys think of these ideas?  Let me know if I said something stupid :)
@_date: 2014-10-17 14:47:45
Why will nodes have to personally verify the full history when consensus should tell them with almost perfect certainty that the current tree root is indeed the state of the chain from within 30 days? The only uncertainty should be caused by a powerful miner modifying blocks from 30 days ago, which should theoretically be impossible computationally.
If consensus is not good enough to verify that the chain state from 30 days ago matches the tree root, then why can normal clients get away with not storing the full chain? Isn't it possible for the full nodes to depend on their peers for tree root consensus just as normal clients use consensus against full nodes?
I'm confused as to why normal clients can safely use consensus, but full nodes can't.

Thanks for taking the time to respond.


If the client stores the block headers, can't they independently verify that the received blocks were indeed the ones we wanted? If yes, lying doesn't get you anywhere, except wasting my bandwidth. The amount of bandwidth you waste can be limited if my client just rejects you after a single bad block. Your peers will stop downloading from you if you send out the wrong blocks, or if you send bad info about which peers I need to connect to for the blocks I want.

You don't have to browse the full source to ensure it's safe (mostly). 
You can view the source history (commits) on Github i.e an attacker would have to merge some code in full view of everyone that monitors the Github repo (thousands of people). So you don't necessarily have to review the source, since it would be difficult for someone to merge code via Github undetected. 
On the other hand, binaries can't have their source checked, so rigging a binary would be easier.

My thinking was that nodes would be forced to relay the tx's to obtain the fee, since they can't spend my tx's output to their address until a miner confirms it. Therefore, they have an incentive to relay if they want the fee.
I agree with the tiny fees problem though, they would have to be large enough to prevent dust/spam.

The old unspent transactions would be saved in the new Base Block indefinitely. Not moving the coins shouldn't prevent you from spending them. Only spent outputs are being deleted during the Rebasing process. Does that make sense? I'm just theorising.

@_date: 2014-10-17 11:49:47
To reduce the size of the blockchain, let's assume we only want to maintain 30 days worth of spent outputs (example time period), and discard all spent outputs older than 30 days.
- Every 30 days, gather all unspent outputs from transactions older than 30 days, and create a new "Base Block" from these transactions. The spent outputs aren't important, so discarding that information shouldn't be a problem.
- All nodes and clients on the network force miners to mine this block by checking if it's been 30 days since the current Base Block was created. If yes, then only accept a new block if it's a new Base Block. Miners won't be able to proceed with standard transaction processing until the Rebasing process is complete, so they have to do it, even for no Block Reward or transaction fees.
- Rebasing regularly means the chain will only ever be 30 days long, but the unspent history is still in the chain no matter how old.
- We save storage space equivalent to the data required to store spent outputs. I don't know how much that is, but I assume it's a lot considering there are more empty addresses than unspent.
- This would require the Base Block to have no block size limit. I'm not sure how to prevent dust input spam from filling up the chain. Perhaps just don't include dust inputs in the base, therefore those transactions will be forgotten after 30 days. This may not be a big deal, since people sending amounts like 0.00000001 BTC are just spamming the network anyway. Sites like Satoshi Dice using dust transactions to signal a betting result outcome to a user, but once the user knows they lost, there's no need to record the dust transaction.
I am not an expert on Bitcoin at all, so please let me know if this is stupid.
@_date: 2014-11-24 11:03:34
Why can't we timestamp transactions to prevent double spends?

Can't the same be said for miners? They use the same concept - the person who controls the majority earns more money. It isn't a problem since there's no restriction of competition. In fact it's even easier to run nodes than mine, so I imagine plenty of people would bring nodes online. 


It's surely more costly to run the node than to pay the fee. The fees would be optional anyway, so they can save the money if they want, just like with normal fees. Also, if they are actually running more nodes to collect their own fees, that benefits the network anyway, because they might as well relay other people's tx's too, and make even more money than only relaying their own.
@_date: 2014-12-22 11:41:50
Would it be a good idea if the maximum block size adjusted automatically, like the difficulty? I.e average number of transactions made in the last 2 weeks.

True. But considering nodes are run on a voluntary basis, we should make it as easy as possible for volunteers to bring new nodes online. The numbers continue to drop as the chain gets bigger, and it won't stop until it gets cheaper to run a node.

That would be a [Double Spend Attack]( The 0 fee doesn't really matter as much as just getting accepted into a block first, which I *think* he can ensure by signing his transaction before sending coins to you. I think miners will prioritise older timestamps over new ones, so he would get included into a block first. The 0 fee helps I suppose, but not much, since there are a quite a few miners who are willing to include 0 fee transactions in their blocks.
Someone more knowledgeable than me can correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2014-11-24 12:23:30


You would be receiving a reward proportional to how many tx's you relay. If a central party is contributing more to the network, they should be paid for it. I don't see how they'd be paid a disproportionate reward if they actually are doing more work.


True, but nodes are already in a position where they're just voluntarily relaying tx's, so I don't see how that would get worse with an incentive structure. I don't think many nodes will say "I'm 2nd, so no thanks," because they're already doing it for free right now, so nothing changes. Yes we would be incentivizing 1st nodes, but if our clients could start regularly connecting to different IP's each startup, then every node, in theory, should get a chance to be a 1st node. 
I understand that not all nodes will be paid consistently, or even at all, but isn't something better than nothing? I just don't see the current "altruism" model lasting in the long term as it gets more expensive to run VPS'. Proof of that is the steady decline of nodes over the past few years. A weak, inconsistent, unfair incentive should still work better than no incentive at all.

Incentivizing nodes
The number of nodes on the network has been declining for a long time now, and it'll only get worse as the cost of running a node continues to rise. Incentivizing them seems like a worthy endeavor. We can't just rely on people's generosity to spend money on nodes, that isn't a dependable system.
For each transaction produced, why not attach a small fee (smaller than the standard tx fee) to pay the first nodes which you relay your transaction to? It wouldn't be asking much of users to, for example, add 0.0001 to each transaction for paying the nodes. 
Nodes may not be profitable to run even with these extra fees, but at least they make some of their money back. I would certainly run a few more nodes if I would even make back a few dollars a month.
Our clients would request addresses from each node we connect to, then as we create transactions, we would include an output for the node's address. Even adding a single cent, or less, would make node operators a little happier, rather than just depending on them to be kind enough to run nodes without financial incentives.
Would such an incentive structure ever be considered for Bitcoin?

If the transaction propagates through the network, and is eventually mined, I can trust that the node did its job. If the transaction doesn't get mined, my client will learn that the node is dishonest, and I'll close my connection to it, and add it to a blacklist. However, nodes probably won't do this, because they want to collect the fees attached to my tx which can only be redeemed by propagating my tx. They have an incentive to act like actual nodes.


Can't the same be said for miners? If running nodes is somehow profitable, then plenty of people will try to run them, I don't see how it would become monopolized when it's easier to run nodes than to mine, yet miners still have at least some competition.

Why don't big pools "selfish mine" against their biggest competitors? Doing so requires only a small amount of hash power to damage a large pool's profitability. This is an easy way to destroy the competition. It benefits Bitcoin because it prevents the profitability of large pools, so we're left with a bunch of small ones.

@_date: 2015-01-15 08:05:08
On average, your tx will still be confirmed in 10 minutes, regardless of size. There will only be a priority problem when the block size limit is reached, and the developers are already considering raising it.

A miner did an AMA recently where he said he'd be fine even if the price went close to $100. I think the hash rate drop was the older hardware being switched off, new hardware might still be profitable. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:27:23
Would it be a good idea to guarantee that a block will be mined in, let's say, 30 minutes? Hear me out... 
Sometimes hours go by without any blocks being found, and it's even technically possible for no blocks to ever be discovered again since mining is a game of chance. Therefore, what if the nodes approved a tiny difficulty level for a block which is the first in 30 minutes, or whatever similar time frame? Meaning, it'll be really easy to mine a block if 30 minutes has passed. I don't see this affecting the block release schedule much, since the difficulty will adapt anyway, and the hour long block delays don't happen too often. Therefore this function won't be triggered often enough to destabilise the average block release time. 
It would also slightly reduce the possibility of never finding a block again, even if that's highly unlikely, it's still nice to have a fallback plan. 
Does this sound like a dumb idea? 
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:40:40
Isn't that an odd use case though? If I'm isolated from the network, I'm screwed no matter what, aren't I? I thought I always needed to connect to multiple nodes to verify that I'm being sent good data, by checking the consensus between the nodes. If I'm isolated to 1 node, then my client can be fed fake transactions right? I don't see why my proposition is a security risk if your scenario leaves me screwed regardless...

How serious is it if Segwit doesn't get activated?
Even ignoring the desperate need for scalability, it seems the bigger problem is that miners are not really in sync with the developers. We've always seen miners working well together with devs to push out updates with no friction, and so if this harmony is now fading away, what does it mean for Bitcoin's future? Will future updates also face this gridlock? Will developers eventually get tired and leave for other projects?

My point was that even if the government declared mining illegal, many miners in China would keep going. As long as they kept their hardware a secret, there's no way to trace it.

@_date: 2016-12-18 06:42:02
Depends on your perspective.
Yes you're technically draining bandwidth from 8 peers without seeding anything back, *but* it's also important that people run their own nodes, to prevent node centralisation. You also get to have a vote on the changes on the network by choosing which client version to run.
It's important that the node count doesn't drop too far down, otherwise it'll be easier to negatively influence the network with malicious nodes. 
Therefore, I would encourage you to keep running the node. It benefits the network overall, and you have a higher level of privacy for your own transactions.

Not quite. Your smartphone can still get malware on it, which would compromise your Bitcoins. 
The Trezor (or other hardware wallets) are considered to be more secure because they can't run any software other than the wallet. If you plan to store large quantities of BTC, then specialised hardware wallets are the way to go.
If you're just storing just a little bit to spend here and there, then yeah a smartphone is fine.

@_date: 2015-08-31 13:52:13
Not quite. I mean transactions don't need to be packed into blocks before the blocks are transmitted across the network, because all receiving nodes already have the transactions in mempools that would be inside that block. I guess that would mean blocks would become much smaller, because we don't waste bandwidth sending tx data twice. That's my understanding from the wiki anyway, which says that we should at some point be able to reduce bandwidth this way.

@_date: 2016-10-17 17:30:53
That won't happen for another 100 years, and the aim with reducing the block reward is that transaction fees take over as a miner incentive. If Bitcoin is still around in 100 years, it's likely that TX fees completely dwarf the block reward, so you won't notice the transition to a 21M cap.

@_date: 2015-03-09 16:38:06
My theory was that if the halving has already been priced in because it's predictable, then it may not move the market at all when the halving happens. Therefore, the price would remain the same while the reward is half gone, which I thought would be a problem for the miners.
However, it's been explained to me that equilibrium will be reached regardless, and that the miners and the network can handle it.
@_date: 2015-03-02 10:25:42
I have an idea for reducing the number of fake nodes on the network, and increasing the cost Sybil attacks. Let me know if I say something dumb.
To operate a full node, we could require the operator to send an arbitrary amount of Bitcoin to a time-lock transaction. Let's say we choose 0.1BTC. The operator sends the 0.1BTC to an address under his control. However, the coins are only spendable after, let's say, 1 year. 
The transaction contains an IP address, declaring which node is making the payment. When our clients connect to a node, the node sends us a signed message using the key to the time-lock transaction, and we can check that their IP address matches in the blockchain. This method ensures a node operator cannot use a single payment to fund infinite nodes just by sharing their private key to all their nodes. We can ensure that their is 1 payment for every node. Bringing thousands of nodes online to attack the network would require a ton of Bitcoins, so this would be very expensive. Currently, it doesn't cost anything to launch such an attack.
We would need a special transaction type for nodes to declare a payment and IP, so that it's easy for a client to search the Blockchain for valid IP nodes just by filtering that transaction type. It doesn't matter if the operator tries to double spend the payment, because our clients will check the balance of the address containing their IP. If the money disappears, we don't connect to the node.
If a node's IP needs to be changed, then they would just declare the change with a new transaction (without having to pay again). All that matters is that a node only has a single IP address, it doesn't matter how often they want to change it.
If an attacker tries to gain a large number of nodes to attack &amp; devalue Bitcoin, they would be destroying their own node investment, because they can't sell those locked coins. The attacker would have to irrationally destroy their own investment if they choose attack the network.
From my understanding, this would solve the problem Bitcoin has where you can run a single malicious node behind an infinite number of IP addresses to pretend you have a ton of nodes, giving an attacker a lot of power regarding what transactions and blocks get relayed.
Is that correct?
@_date: 2015-03-30 11:47:17
Why can't you be certain that you're not being double-spent after just waiting like 30 seconds? It takes even less than that to propagate a transaction over the whole network.
In other words, isn't it impossible to double spend after a tx has fully propagated?

Would it not be possible for the protocol to somehow account for this?

Are there any other ways to fix this without a fork?
If we're speaking in hypotheticals, reverting to HEAD~1 doesn't guarantee that a new block will be discovered soon either ;)
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:12:59


Well the main thing is that you're declaring that you have Bitcoin software on your computer, so you become a more profitable target for a hacker. Any vulnerabilities on your system are now more likely to be targeted than the average person's computer. A common piece of advice is to never store Bitcoins on a full node. That way, you don't have to worry about a breach. 
Also, look up fail2ban. It's software that helps block the inevitable network spam that comes in after opening a port on your computer or router to the outside world.

Wouldn't the price need to double if the reward halves? Otherwise the miners lose money, and we lose some hashrate. If the reward halving is already priced in (possibility), then miners will have lost half their revenue. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:04:14
If SHA256 is ever shown to be compromised, what should we do? If we change the mining algorithm to something else, millions of dollars worth of ASIC hardware would become useless.

If the price doesn't rise, will halvings be a problem?
From my understanding, halvings were scheduled with the expectation that the price would keep rising enough to compensate miners for losing half the reward. If the price doesn't rise, then the hash rate would crash as mining becomes much less profitable. If Bitcoin doesn't become mainstream, and so the price remains low, will it handle the future halvings safely?
@_date: 2015-03-02 12:13:44
Don't we incentivise against a mining 51% attack with the same idea? That no rational miner would destroy their own investment? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:23:58
It would be costly for you because of the fees required to create 1GB worth of transactions.
Also, remember that block saturation is already a problem if you have enough money. I can just create a ton of transactions right now (with a fee) and fill up the 1MB block. This problem gets alleviated with no block limit, because the blocks never get saturated. Also, if people are paying fees, then I don't see the problem with massive blocks. As long as fees are paid, a transaction shouldn't be labelled as spam.
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:01:31
Good point 
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:22:41
We could force them to pay fees with nodes enforcing the rule. A miner could try paying himself the fees to make it cheap to saturate the network, but they would only be able to do that for the % of their hashpower. They can't saturate all 1000 of those blocks, therefore they can't artificially spike the block limit. An artificial block size increase would require a collusion between miners to attack the network with bloated blocks. A single miner/pool wouldn't get very far. Is that right, or did I miss something? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:02:06
What would be the problem with having an infinite block size, as long as there were minimum fees?
The 1MB limit was implemented as a spam prevention mechanism, but you wouldn't have much spam if a minimum fee was required. Nodes could have a rule to simply reject any transactions without a fee. This would allow the block size to scale according to increased adoption, instead of arbitrary limits. Miners might support it because they gain more fees if there are more transactions happening, and their orphan rates might not be a problem with Gavin's fast headers relay idea.
If spam was never a problem, would the developers have implemented a 1MB limit at all?
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:15:35
Is there a roadmap for when full nodes function as SPV servers? They  already store the whole blockchain, so it doesn't seem like much more resources would be required to serve SPV wallets. I think that would be much better than depending on separate implementations like Electrum Server, because there will always be less 3rd party nodes than official nodes, so it makes sense if we could rely on these extra nodes.

If CPU and GPU mining are impossible now, isn't it likely that whatever mining rigs being used in the world now will be completely useless in a few months/years? The minimum investment cost to mine will only go up, considering that's what's happened so far. My point was that if the cost keeps going up, then the number of voters in a pool would go down, because small miners won't be able to afford the minimum investment. For example, a few years ago I could've spend a few hundred to buy GPU's to mine thousands of coins. However, now I require thousands of dollars to buy the bare minimum hardware. Eventually it'll be tens of thousands, and then hundreds of thousands, which means only massive operations will have voting power in pools.

I'll copy my comment to someone else:


If the miners weren't a threat, then would the proposal work? If it costs $50000 to attack the network, then isn't that ok? It would probably be cheaper to make enough dishonest nodes to attack the network. Block saturation would be a more expensive attack.
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:45:30
Miners can already do that now if they want, by creating useless 1MB blocks. They don't because it devalues their own investment. Wouldn't that explain why we don't see miners already screwing up the network?

Every additional honest miner increases the cost to defraud the network. Being part of a pool doesn't take this away, since each miner can still choose to leave if the pool does something malicious.

@_date: 2015-02-23 13:46:49
True, I can't see a way around that. I suppose if miners on that pool would probably leave if they saw that happening though, right? Assuming the majority of individual miners support an increase, a pool operator won't be able to stop it for long, because people will just leave. That just leaves an individual massive miner stopping the network. Is that likely to happen though? If we made it 750 out of the last 1000 blocks must be 70%, or 80% saturated, then isn't it pretty unlikely for a single miner to own enough hash power to stop it, or even want to if they did? I understand that it's still not impossible, but it seems quite unlikely. The fixed block increases that Gavin proposes also has its pitfalls...is my proposal definitely worse than arbitrarily picking a larger limit? Gavin wants to setup a scheduled increase, which can't possibly predict transaction amounts in the future. But without a scheduled increase, we'll have to hardfork again after the 20MB change. Assuming all of these strategies have their flaws, I still think a gradual increase has less pitfalls than randomly guessing about the future, or repeatedly hardforking to keep raising the limit.

How can I withdraw funds from cryptothrift.com?
We do not hold any funds for neither the seller or the buyer on our site, all Escrow funds are held on a separate server and they get automatically sent to the seller when the buyer clicks on “Release Escrow” from the “Won Items” page. Buyers funds can be refunded manually either when a seller cancels a sale or if the buyer have requested an escrow refund.
... 
You gave them an address already which they've sent the funds to after you sold an item I assume. Does that sound right?

Really? What SPV client can use Bitcoin Core? Or are you using a different type of node?
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:20:22
No, I mean we instate mandatory fees to prevent that 100MB block of spam of coins moving back and forth. The only exception to the fee would be, as you say, the old coins moving around. Old coins can only be moved once before no longer being considered old, so they can't spam the chain by moving back and forth. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:14:12
Can we auto increase the block size limit according to the average number of transactions done over the previous n-blocks?
The main argument I hear against raising the limit is that someone will suddenly spam the system with massive blocks. What if the we allowed blocks to get just a tiny bit larger if the limit was previously reached for the last, let's say, 1000 blocks (7 days). That way the cost to spam the network is huge, you would have to spam transactions to fill a thousand blocks before the limit goes up, so it would be almost impossible for there to suddenly be 1GB blocks floating around the network. Nodes would obviously have to block zero fee transactions, otherwise it's still easy to spam.
This allows the system to automatically scale according to Bitcoin's increased adoption, rather than just guessing random block limits ourselves.
Would this work?

Perhaps we could make nodes reject empty and fee-less blocks? You could try and circumvent this by making transactions with fees with the aim of collecting your fees back, but that would be a huge risk if another miner mines a block instead of you. Then you lose your fees. Wouldn't this prevent miners from creating useless massive blocks?

Does P2Pool prevent 51% attacks? I asked this on a previous Monday post, and was told no. I'm not quite sure how it works.


Understand that if they would pull something, me and other miners would leave, and they would no longer be "in control" of that hashing power.
But as the hashrate goes up, the members of the pool would have to own more and more hardware to keep up. Just like to become a miner now you need thousands of dollars to get going, over the years this number will go up. Therefore, the number of voters controlling a pool will steadily reduce to only the richest miners, like the million dollar mining operations.

If fees were mandatory, such an attack would be very costly to sustain. If we assume that they won't happen because of the expense, then only legit transactions will get through, so the chain won't get bloated until tons of new users enter the system.

I think his point was that it would be flagged as suspicious, because there's so many regulations for money laundering. Plenty of legitimate banking customers get their accounts frozen all the time, so bitcoin is an alternative against that. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:18:05
The miner that tries to circumvent fees that way to saturate the blocks won't get very far though, because they won't get to mine every block. If they're attempting to saturate 1000 blocks to spike the block limit, they wouldn't have enough hashing power to do so.

That's fine, we can allow old coins to move without fees, since that wouldn't work for spamming. If we made an exception for this use case, would the idea still work?
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:02:39
If mining is eventually controlled by a handful of datacenters, isn't that a problem? From my understanding, this is inevitable because small miners are gradually being squeezed out of the network. If we're left with a handful of entities controlling all hashing power, won't that reduce Bitcoin close to a "single point of failure?" Are there any solutions to this problem?
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:59:35
Is there a reason why the difficulty adjusts on average every 2 weeks? I know you need a large sampling of average block discovery times to calculate an appropriate difficulty, but 2 weeks still seems like a risky amount of time. 
If a large group of miners suddenly went offline, block discovery will take much longer because of the lowered hashrate. The  difficulty will take a huge amount of time to retarget because of the slow block discovery. We now have a network with delayed confirmation times for much longer than 2 weeks. 
Would it be worth considering lowering the retarget time, or is there a reason why 2 weeks is considered optimum? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:10:41
A push mechanism would probably be more efficient than pull. However, this would require a node to maintain a list of addresses to "watch." If eventually there are hundreds of millions of people using Bitcoin, each with HD wallets with tons of addresses, how many addresses is each node expected to watch? It would be quite a few I imagine. Perhaps some kind of load balancing among nodes would be applied, so that each nodes carries a somewhat equal burden of addresses, but that would be hard to implement without trust issues.
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:55:52
I disagree. A miner has no guarantee that they'll be lucky enough to mine the next block. So if they fill a target block with bogus fees to meet the minimum, there's a good chance that a competing miner will win the block and take their fees.

Is it possible to produce sub-xpubkeys?
If Alice wants Bob to regularly send her money to a different address each time for the sake of her privacy, she has to somehow send him a ton of keys to send money to. She doesn't want to just give Bob her master public key (xpubkey) because then Bob could track all the money Alice receives on all of her keys. Instead, it would be awesome if Alice could give Bob a seed to create pub keys with, and send his money to those keys. This seed can be mathematically derived from Alice's master key. She doesn't need to record this 2nd key, because it's calculated from the original key by the wallet software.
This allows Alice to give sub public key seeds to anyone, while maintaining her original master key's privacy, AND she only has to record a single seed.
Does this concept seem mathematically possible? It would solve a big problem regarding address reuse. For example, instead of having a set withdrawal address on your exchange's website which gets reused, your exchange uses your sub xpubkey to create new addresses to send your withdrawals to, increasing your privacy by never reusing addresses.

Will it ever be possible to start Bitcoin Core without connecting to a set of trusted IP addresses? From my understanding, these addresses give us information on how to connect to other nodes, so if the first IP's are compromised then they'll only tell us about other bad nodes too. We depend on these hardcoded addresses to be trustworthy, so is it possible for us to get rid of this dependency? I'm not sure how node discovery would work here...

In that case, i imagine fees will have to go up quite a bit after a few block halvings, unless the price goes up. The alternative is a massive influx of fee paying users, in which case increasing the block limit would be more profitable for miners. I suppose there's no way to tell either price or adoption rate for the future, so i see why this is a difficult problem.

Who posted "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" on the p2p foundation site?
There's a lot of evidence that Dorian isn't Satoshi, so it probably wasn't him. The foundation said they didn't find any signs of a hack on their site. So, either Satoshi himself posted the message, or someone has his login details. If someone got his login details, what do they gain by posting this message? Does it seem most likely that it was actually Satoshi?

Is it possible for SPV "thin-client" wallets to scale?
To use Electrum as an example, Electrum clients currently send a list of addresses to a server, and the server scans its blockchain, and notifies the user about an incoming transaction. Electrum requests the payment status from the server every few seconds. If there are for example 50 addresses in the average user's wallet, and there are 1 million bitcoin users, that would be polling a server for the status of 50 million addresses every few seconds. 
How many servers would the world require to handle mass adoption of thin clients? As bitcoin becomes more popular, the blockchain will get large enough to take a lot of nodes offline. However, we'll need nodes to increase to support adoption of thin clients. Satoshi mentions SPV in the whitepaper, so he had some idea of nodes becoming thin-client servers, but I don't see how this scales for the masses if everyone needs to be notified of incoming transactions every few seconds.

Good point, I didn't consider that old addresses don't have to be checked as often. I agree with the offchain transactions too.
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:46:31
Is it possible to check the propogation status of a transaction to protect against double spends, without waiting for a proper confirmation?
If a merchant could see that a transaction has propogated to, let's say, 90% of the network, then they could be relatively certain that a double spend isn't going to overwrite the transaction. Considering that transactions typically propogate to the majority of the network within just a few seconds, this would be a good way to accept zero confirmation transactions with some certainty.
It'll still be less secure than waiting for a confirmation, but it would be a big step up from the current model of just hoping someone doesn't steal from you, or actually waiting 10 whole minutes, or depending on 3rd parties like Bitpay to insure your losses.
I assume it would've already been implemented if it was possible, so sorry if I missed something obvious.

If nodes forced minimum fees, then they wouldn't have a choice, right?


If a single pool tried to fill blocks with junk to saturate then blockchain, they wouldn't get very far unless they had the majority of the hashing power. If a pool has 20% of the hashrate, they'll only be able to "wreck" 20% of the blocks, not 100%. Therefore, their attack doesn't get very far.

Yeah I read that somewhere too. It doesn't matter though, existing seeds will still work.
@_date: 2013-10-23 03:55:19
1) Yep. You need to pick a password strong enough to trust your money with. You can test the strength of various passwords with online tools (meaning, test how different character combinations affect the strength...don't ever type in the real chosen password online). Pick a password that is **at least** a whole sentence, preferably several, which does not appear anywhere in real life (no phrases from books, songs, movies, anything Google-able).
2) The software of your choice, like Electrum, can take this password and hash it into a Private Key, and a Public Key can be derived from the Private Key. I don't imagine well established software like Electrum will change their seed algorithms any time soon, so you should be pretty safe in 20 years time. 
3) If you ensure the computer you're using to retrieve your Private Key is always offline or running from a Live CD, there should be minimal risk of theft. I say minimal, not impossible, because you could still get a virus by plugging in an infected USB, or if someone steals your keylogged computer. 
There's some more info [here](
Even if all this seems tedious, brain wallets are still by far the most secure form of long-term storage. Paper wallets can be stolen, wallet.dat files in your client can be stolen, online wallets can be hacked. When used correctly, brain wallets will only be compromised if you yourself tell someone your password/seed.

CPU power is not progressing at the rate of ASICs, yes, however new Bitcoin users are downloading clients every day, which means new CPUs to contribute to the network. If Bitcoin ever becomes mainstream, this could be millions of clients hashing away (while they're open), and while they may never become the majority in mining power, at least the extra expense will put off some attackers. The alternative is to accept that the group of miners will steadily become smaller and smaller, and Bitcoin's vulnerability becomes larger and larger.


Yes, but an additional 1% usage from Bitcoin clients will hardly make a difference to the electricity bill. I'm not saying force everyone to leave their computers running 24/7.

If Bitcoin becomes more popular over time, the number of nodes will increase. However, even if the combined power of these nodes doesn't reach 51%, it still makes it much more expensive to launch a 51% attack. The more it costs, the less likely it is for someone to try it.
