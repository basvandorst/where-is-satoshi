People have been holding for 3 years without price movement before price increase last year so few months is nothing. 
And price never went up after consensus actually. Take a look at the dates on the chart when consensuses happened. Price only went up months after that but not because few thousand people went to consensus.

Yes it can be. If only 3 biggest mining pools combine hashing power they can take full control of the network which could last for years since they will continue to buy all the hardware with insane profits and you cant compete with them. Every POW coin can be attacked and some low cap coins even for less than 100$ per 1 hour. You can check prices of 51% attack here:

Sha256 does support GPU mining but performance is terrible compared to ASICs. It is not changed to something else for network security because 51% attacks are a big problem right now. If GPU mining for Bitcoin would be profitable somebody would make ASICs again and person that does it first can take control of network for years if competition doesnt make cheaper and more powerful ASICs again.
