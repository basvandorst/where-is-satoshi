Interesting the time this story got mentioned here on the subreddit to the time it gets covered in more traditional media (keeping in mind that there are some time for producing the coverage) April 2 2013, on Bloomberg's small business report.

Hope for the update how far out are you from Beta?
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:14:03
Please do keep it in mind and share it with your friends. It is a good idea to get as many people actually using the coin for goods and services.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:27:19
Thanks for the opportunity. Are there other sites that you think might be worth posting to?

Who in the world is shorting bitcoin? Which exchange allows for real shorting?

Nice choice using bootstrap!

What is going to happen when all the Bitcoin is mined? Will transaction fees cover off the newtwork costs at that time? 24hrs x 365. Or will the network just thin out once all the bitcoin is mined?

I guess I should have read further down the list of correspondence. With all the exchanges out there what will be your competitive advantage (as much as you are comfortable revealing). Are you also a member of the local meetup?
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:13:42
The questions are reasonable. Hopefully they will show some trend towards greater circulation if bitcoin for goods and services.

I think that this is a good strategy to promote awareness. We are currently offering a 10% discount to those paying for office space in our loft-like space in Toronto
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:16:02
Coworkingspace.ca started accepting bitcoin for office over 3 weeks ago. We should encourage as many facilities as possible to accept bitcoin so that we will see the acceptance of bitcoin for more goods and services!
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:41:07
Thank you, this is useful information!
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:17:39
I don't think this guy is foolish, I just wonder about how realistic the sale might be. I mean, is there someone in that Alberta town ready to drop that amount of bitcoin on a house? The house will probably go up about 2.5% per year. What will his bitcoin do? Up or down over the next year, but way more than 2.5%

I would be interested in hosting an event as early as this weekend. Or perhaps Easter Monday. Please contact me if you are interested in getting together to review prospective opportunities and strategies going forward. Please feel free to contact me at contact (at) coworkingspace (dot) ca

I agree. It would have to stabilize within a reasonable range. Another issue might very well be the $$$ involved. Why would Tim Hortons trust a company like bitpay at this juncture in time?

Reading here I wonder if there are any of the 5000+ BTC holders that are permanently lost because their passwords are lost? Is there a number on how many of BTC are lost? It would be interesting to see how many are being held because their is a hope that the value is heading to say $1000, vs how many just cannot be accessed.

Real estate is most interesting to locals unless it is vacation property. It will be someone looking for a house in that Alberta city that might be tempted. How many of you have +/-$400,000 of bitcoins in your wallet. Yesterday Coworkingspace.ca announced that it was accepting bitcoin for office space in Toronto. Again it will be of interest to those that need an office space toronto, of course rental rates are much lower than purchase rates so perhaps someone will come forward.

Not only is pricing difficult as you point out, the 'economy' will not be happening if folks just hoard their coins as this person purports to be doing!!
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:01:30
Like others I wonder why you would need a middle man for transactions of this sort? Would seem like they are not happening very often. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:52:55
I had this thought a few weeks ago. Why would this idea not work?
@_date: 2013-04-06 22:05:37
It would be good if they indicated where this might be available. This group is based in Memphis, and are accepting bitcoin for residential rents. We are in Toronto and except bitcoin for commercial rents. Indeed we are giving a 10% discount for bitcoin.

Why in the world would Canadian Banks prepare Cyprus Style Confiscation laws? Canadian banking system is more disciplined than many many others.  Must be some sort of April Fool's joke.

419. Four Hundred and Nineteen. Four One Nine. Funny though.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:19:52
Coworkingspace.ca is already accepting bitcoin for office space. In fact it is at a 10% discount!
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:16:48
Are you not assuming that coworkingspace.ca does not have a need or use for bitcoin? It is possible that the payment could be converted to cash, but why not just spend the coin elsewhere that accepts it? I would suggest that this is where the value of the currency is, otherwise there collectible value may be akin to cabbage patch doll or some such thing!
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:05:14
Wholeheartedly agree with you and are currently offering a 10% discount for in Toronto shopping for office space and wanting to use their bitcoin at coworkingspace.ca

Run a centre for entrepreneurs and startups in Toronto. Want to get a cluster of bitcoin focused companies into the centre. Accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for space in the facility.

I belong to the Toronto meetup and I also noticed an absence of women in the membership, at least anything obvious from the Bios, but from my meeting with the organizer I can't see why women would not feel welcome. Perhaps there is just not enough interest amongst women at this point. No doubt this will change going forward.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:07:40
Thank you. Spread the word, and try to get such a centre in your town to buy into the idea! Let's let people be a creative and entrepreneurial as they can be!
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:35:49
not wanting to quibble but the transaction was refunded or reversed according to the article you cite: "Koss has refunded Nefario’s rent money, transferring the Bitcoin back to him...". So, there was no exchange of goods, services, space, etc. for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:38:30
This seems to be a significant obstacle: Some level of Stability. Going up is great for anyone that gets paid, but on the way down not so much...I know I do not want to be scrambling to sell the payment I received to preserve some value; and I do not think payment services will be helpful either as a quick bitcoins drop by 10 or 20%, it might wipe them out!
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:29:08
canadian Art Rental Store also accepts bitcoin: Br0ker.ca that's a number zero not the letter 'o' in the middle
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:00:22
I agree. We are currently willing to give a 10% DISCOUNT to those paying for Office Space in Toronto with Bitcoin. Tell your Toronto based developer, friends, coders, startups that need office space to take a look at our site:
