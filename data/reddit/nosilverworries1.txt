I've had this problem all day.  Tried to buy multiple times and get the same email from Coinbase - both in trying with CC and with bank account.  And my account is not new...has worked fine in the past.  Coinbase sucking like usual

Yes, that is the latest development.  But nonetheless, the message you received (in not being able to process the transaction and canceled by your bank) is a lie and has nothing to do with why people can't actually buy or sell right now.  The banks are not canceling...it's something wrong with Coinbase.

This is happening to a bunch of people right now actually...something must be wrong with Coinbase.  Multiple banks are reporting that they are not actually receiving requests.  Check Coinbase's reddit page to see what I'm talking about

Don't use your mom's ID if she doesn't want you to out of respect for her (reason  not to mention it would (maybe?) be considered fraudulent (reason   More than just being uneasy about the wisdom of investing in crypto, she probably just doesn't want the hassle of her information being ascribed to something she's unsure of.
You could try the option of creating a paper wallet online (pretty sure it's both free and easily accessible) and then receiving payment(s) to that paper wallet doing odd jobs.  If you can't find someone to pay in crypto for that, then use the $100 to buy something and flip it in exchange for crypto.  That's becoming more common online now.
