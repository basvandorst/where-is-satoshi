who's used Bitsource.org? anyone care to share their experience?
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:46:56
Ok, so a lot of people thought paypal + bitcoin = good news
I think "Bitlicense" is good news. 
Bitcoin is subversive, not just "better payment processing"

that's a tree if i ever saw one!  it's like in fantasia when mickey keeps multiplying. i expanded the trees for 20 minutes wachting the wallets break in two each time until most ended in wallets containing &lt;20 BTC. Would watching those wallet addresses be useful? I can understand why shared send would not be for the original wallet but will it not be interesting to see where these pop up?

It's all kind of ironic. 
The article makes his argument sound like:
"If we accuse you, and arrest you for something you didn't do,
you better hope we have access to your data so we can prove your innocence."
Mind boggling logic

dude, "illegal activity"?
- i'd rather get paid in BTC any day than waiting weeks for a check that's been plundered by the feds and multiple states and then have to find a friend to sign it over to and cash it and hope their bank lets them. i could go on but ya'll know, checks suck. 
- Also, I'm sure fiat is mentioned more often in Hollywood being used for "illegal activity". I can't prove that it scares folks from still using cash. Let them talk shit, if we use it, it has value and if it has value we use it. don't worry about defending it, it's all good.
