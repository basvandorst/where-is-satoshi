Good question. Some people say bitcoin is a trojan horse to push for a cashless society and that they will ban it once we have accepted the life without cash. This rhetoric kinda make sense until it doesn't. The genie is out of the bottle, this thing is not going away and if governments thought they could introduce it and later remove it they are fools which is why I don't believe this theory one second but many actually do.
Interestingly governments also want a global world currency 
The only thing that got me meh, is the timing. Bitcoin couldn't have come at a better time...sometimes I get a bit suspicious but there are so many coders around the world who reviewed the code and they all said it's secure, once you are 100% positive the code does exactly what it says then there is no need to look elsewhere for theories.
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:56:03
I don't know why the miners want to play the waiting game with core, core has nothing to lose if bitcoin stay stuck at 1mb but the miners will lose a lot of money when people use another coin. Maybe they think the store of value use case alone is enough? From a business point of view it makes no sense what the miners are doing. If they were signaling for BU then I would understand but they don't. They are just waiting for core to compromise, it's not going to happen.

I hope there is a strong reputation system otherwise there will be theft and counterfeit money running rampant

A chain split due to core not increasing to 2mb would be even more silly

The advantage is that your private keys are always offline, even for wallet generation and signing. If the device fails you just have to restore your wallet with the back up.
It's definetely worth it especially if you have a substancial amount of coins. 
What I really like is the convenience to send a transaction while not having to worry about site being hacked or virus stealing my coins.
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:56:14

@_date: 2017-01-12 13:02:07
If you want peace of mind buy a hardware wallet, they are virus proof.
A website can get hacked and there is no guarantee you will get refunded when that happen.
Or you can use a smartphone app like breadwallet or mycelium where you control the keys, just make sure to back up the 12 words in a secure place offline.

Cash deposit is anonymous. Find someone with a german bank account who want to sell bitcoin and physically deposit cash in their account. Localbitcoins used to be a good site to do that but they banned Germany recently, so maybe search for another one.

There is also this theory that if they aggressively try to ban bitcoin it will show that they are not confident in their own currency ( for good reasons)  But be honest it's a fucking mystery why they havn't done anything yet, which is why I am watching with my popcorn very close.

What's the future of bitcoin without segwit then?
@_date: 2017-01-05 09:17:32


Arbitrage is the reason prices are almost the same across all exchanges. Without it the price on chinese exchange would be 100 times higher because that's where the buying is happening.
The reason western markets are catching up is because traders buy it low for euros/usd and then sell it high on chinese exchanges for CNY.  
The problem is that not everyone can turn these yuan back to usd/euros without using bitcoin. Especially with capital controls and all that. 


Volume doesn't determine the price.

There was an article about this on coindesk recently. From what I remember they said that the first simple version of LN is ready and that people will be able to use it with real bitcoin as soon as segwit is deployed. They also said that routing on a large scale hasn't been tested and that large payment may have problems to find a route. So it is definetely not vaporware but needs real life testing to see how it works.

Does this mean that when segwit is implemented merchant and businesses can accept 0 confirmation transactions?
@_date: 2016-12-09 02:48:27
"Technically" maybe isn't the correct word but in term of consumer friendliness some blockchains offer zero fee transactions, with a few sec confirmation time and can handle thousands of t/s. They are  weak when it comes to immutability though.

I could do the calculation for one amount but the amount is always changing so i can't be bothered to do the math every time.
There are sites that will calculate how much a certain % of a certain number is, but i want a site that calculate every % from 100 to 1 of a certain number, hopefully that make sense.

Ok thanks, that's what I wanted to know. I thought author of this post knew what he was talking about because he was using fancy words and I personnaly am no programmer.
@_date: 2016-12-06 06:10:01
Do you have the wallet file backed up or seed words? If so remove multibit from your laptop and redownload the program, then import your back up and you should see the correct balance.Or you could just try to close the app and reopen it.  Did your coins moved from the wallet or are they still sitting in the sending address?
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:41:09
Probably more than a year. I don't think core will start working on other scaling improvement before its clear segwit is going to be implemented or not. Maybe they will work on fungibility but not scaling, they already spent so much time coding and testing segwit...I could be wrong though

@_date: 2017-01-25 11:41:41
Never thought about this but it make sense. If bitcoin becomes mainstream there will be millions of people willing to mine at a loss to secure the network ( Im not talking a big loss, but say $10-20 dollar a month per person multiplied by million would ad a lot of hashpower ) This effectively means that the block reward dropping is good for decentralization. So we shouldn't worry about how to pay the miners in the future, people who mine for profit will be replaced by people/businesses that mine to support the network.

If satoshi's identity was known people would have turned to him long time ago to solve this debate. The argument on both side has always been" follow satoshi's vision". 


My point is that bitcoin has a prestige side to it than no other altcoins will have due to the fact that it's the evolution of satoshi's code base.
And yes many people are willing to pay premium for newly minted coins.

Ok thanks for the answer
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:11:01
A blocksize increase is not a solution, what happens when we hit the new limit do we fork another time? Bitcoin is rapidly going to look like a joke if it forks every other day.
Core want dynamic/flexible block size too, so essentially they also want what BU want but they don't want to rush something like this now because they understand the risks and need to do more research. 
Personnaly my investment feels much safer with core than other random stonehead developers.
One thing is certain, you can't scale bitcoin to visa levels on chain without turning it into paypal 2.0. If the blockchain would grow 1000 times faster than today ( visa levels) nodes would be dropping like flys.
The argument so far that I have heard from BU supporters is that they are not against segwit they just want to make sure that core doesn't keep the 1mb limit forever. So apparently they think the LN will only need 1mb blocks to serve billions of people. Naive at best.

Circle is required to comply with AML/KYC so i highly doubt they don't have your ID. Maybe you provided it a long time ago and don't remember or circle didn't have these requirement at the time...It's way too risky for any bitcoin business to accept credit cards without ID.

Did you buy with a credit card? if so you will receive an email soon and be required to provide ID verifications before your withdrawal can be approved.
The reason i left circle is because of this, they are very sneaky. They don't tell anything about ID up until you actually buy and send the BTC. Then they will block your coins and ask for verification so now you have no choice but send them ID if you want the bitcoin. They don't seem to understand the benefits of being upfront and honest with their customers..too bad for them.
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:04:40

Article says : Curators are willing to pay for good content because they know they can profit by reselling it. 
On Yours, anyone can be a curator by paying both the creator and the other curators who brought this to their attention. A curator can then earn money by reselling the piece of content and keeping a portion of the revenue.
Reselling to whom? I thought the point of this platform is not to resell and cut the middleman. If curators have to pay to curate then we have a problem I think. Maybe I missed something?
