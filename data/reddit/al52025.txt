I would use gemini but screw there fees. Gdax has no fees for limit buys or sells

Considering I could have made 5k since last night I think now it's the best time 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:21
what gdax is going to shut down and run away with everyones money?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:02:32
If you're going to do this every month use gdax. It uses the same account as coinbase but way lower fees. You have to transfer money into it from you coinbase account which takes about a week but worth it for lower fees. If you setup a limit buy it will have no fees

How do you tell the fees? I've only transferred from there once and it said about low medium or high priority but I don't remember it showing me what the actual fee was

i dont want to withdraw anything. I just wanted to day trade a little and buy back into bitcoin at another time
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:05:41
Why use a different Exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:35
I just wanna do some day trading
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:53:40
Omg that's ridiculous
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:53:54
Yeah but there isnt even a pending transactions like there are with my other 2. They show me its pending how much it was and how much bitcoins it bought me
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:54:25
So you're saying you can do something about it....
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:15:56
What a noob....
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:06:53
I called and they hang up because they have a high call volume. I emailed them but it said it may take several days to respond. Like wtf. They have my $1000 and I have nothing
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:50:21
I just got off the phone with someone. Took me 20 minutes before they figured out what I was trying to explain. It sounds like it was a glitch and it purchased $1000 but I got nothing from it. I can see the delivery date for the 2 purchases I  made. Those are fine and legit and they match up with the 2 pending transactions on my bank statement. But they took $1000 out of my bank account already and I have nothing in my bitcoin wallet or usd wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:02:58
yes it does they lock in that price when you hit the buy button. you just dont get them under they get their money
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:48:43
Yeah thats right. Because no one on this sub asks anything about coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:49:08
Awesome. Thanks guys

coinbase shows 4 transactions. 2 that I purchased and awaiting for the funds and 2 for deposited funds into GDAX which is waiting to clear. Those 4 are on my bank account too. But coinbase also took out $1000 from my bank account and I have no idea why. I though it was from when I purchase it the first time but if they took my money I should have bitcoins in my account
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:54:57
That's what I was figuring. Maybe good enough for alt coins? I've never mined before so don't know exactly what to do but wanted to ask if I should try and mine or just sell the card 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:00:26
As far as I understand when you hit buy on coinbase it buys the bitcoins at that price and you have to wait until they transfer money from your bank account. The other 2 transactions did exactly that. I see they are pending but I can see how many bitcoins it purchased. I dont have the bitcoins until they get the money from the bank

I mean what's a good exchange that sells bch. Apparently bitfinex can't help with US customers 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:50:19
through my bank account like I did with the other 2 transactions. I did it on Nov 1st and they took money out of my bank nov 2
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:24:03
Where is the best exchange for buying bch without waiting for funds
