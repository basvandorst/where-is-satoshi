That's not assimilation. It failed to achieve network consensus, so it's not bitcoin.
Dynamic block size a pretty contentious idea, and bitcoin doesn't implement improvements that aren't almost universally agreed upon. That's why it's so resilient and secure.
If a competitor is clearly superior, then it's easier to just improve bitcoin than for people to switch. Switching might result in lost funds, and the new competitor isn't as proven as bitcoin anyway, so it's a risky idea all around.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:39:44
Right, which is like buying more CPUs of the same power/quality.
Bitcoin is improving the CPU instead, which in this analogy (and with bitcoin) should be more efficient. Think of a cpu from 10 years ago. Even 10 of them together wouldn't be nearly as good as 1 cpu from this year.
(I'm not saying it's a great analogy because it's not, I'm just explaining it)

It's just saying that bcash is buying more crappy computers when Bitcoin is upgrading to one great computer.
Usually the great computer will outshine many older computers.
It's not specific at all.

In this analogy Bitcoin is more like the internet than the startups.
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:41:50
Yes. Even if there are dozens of payment processors, they'll all probably have channels connecting them all together.
This means that you'll basically be able to pay anyone else on the entire network with just one channel.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:05:38
It's the lightning **network**, not the lightning payment channel.
channels can be kept open to route other payments and potentially rebalance your channel.
Most of the time you'll be able to pay someone without opening a channel with them.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:29:53
That's true now, but there are plans to allow channel refills in future versions of the protocol.
That would mean you could add funds to a channel with a single on-chain transaction instead of 2 (closing and opening a new one)
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:34:23
Can it be fixed with a microcode update?
Could this microcode update maintain the performance benefit?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:55:08
There's no good proof that it *isn't* the right path, but there's also no good evidence that it is either.
Bitcoin cash has lower fees primarily because fewer people are using it. Bitcoin had low fees 2 years ago before the mempool was backlogged too.
The best part about lightning is that it doesn't require any kind of change to bitcoin. It required segwit, but that was also beneficial for many unrelated reasons.
Here's a loose analogy:
If a webpage is loading slowly, then it's because you can't download the amount of data required fast enough.
Lightning is like reducing the size of websites by optimizing code. A block size increase is like upgrading the internet's infrastructure to fiber optics.
Which one is easier? Which one is more likely to cause a disruption to internet access?
Maybe we'll need both lightning *and* a block size increase (probably), but if fiber is completely unnecessary, then why go through risks and costs of installing it?
Also, core doesn't make decisions. They just suggest and develop improvements. The only way for those improvements to be truly implemented is through achieving network consensus.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:26:59
More like this:
A block size increase would be another lemonade stand with another seller.
LN would be like a fully automated lemonade machine that can serve any number of people at once and is much faster than the seller ever was for each individual person.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:57:24


I doubt this will be the case. Wallets will manage this automatically, so the average user won't even need to understand what a channel is.


If you allow payments to be relayed through your node, then you could potentially set fees based on channel balance. This would re-balance your channels over time due to the fee market. (EDIT: This went over my head. Yeah it's true, but I don't see how anyone would only have 1 channel like I said above)
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:24:51
That's a little ironic considering that the whole point of Bitcoin is to eliminate trust from the monetary system.
I'm not saying you're wrong, but in my ideal society, everyone would understand at least the basic overview of this tech.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:44:59
If you can't route a payment through the channels you already have, then you have no other choice...
This means most of your payments will be off chain, but some will require opening a new channel. This obviously reduces the load on the blockchain compared to everyone making every transaction on chain.
Obviously it's not perfect yet, but it's a step in the right direction, and many improvements are already in the works like channel factories.

Bitcoin isn't like a product. It can, has, and will evolve. 
If another cryptocurrency has a great idea, then it will just be assimilated into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:43:54


Exactly! A company would make one final decision. You'd have to trust the judgement of the management.
Bitcoin allows literally anyone to suggest and implement improvements, then the decision is up to the entire network through consensus.
You don't have to trust individuals, you just have to trust the community as a whole.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:19:25
Bitcoin is an open source, decentralized protocol.
Unlike a company, it doesn't rely on the competency of individuals, and it doesn't rely on investments to succeed, just use.
Like the internet, bitcoin becomes more useful as more people use it, and it's difficult to switch to a new system.
This means it probably won't be replaced easily, but improved slowly over time like the internet.
This is especially true because it is the most proven, stable, and secure crypto currency by a long shot. People don't like taking risks with money.

What's the point of doing the freezing in the first place if you could already revive them?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:34:17
By my math, owning a majority of the 21m (21 million) total amount of bitcoins possible would be more than 10.5m
The current amount of mined coins is 16.8m, so in order to own a true majority of all bitcoin, a "small concentration" of people would need to own 63% of the current supply.
Doesn't seem unreasonable to me...
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:12:00
17.5 blocks is only around 3 hours. That's pretty damn fast.
The supply/demand argument is what I think will happen too. That doesn't really take away any importance from segwit though.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:49:43
the ability to send lightning transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:28:13
It's also worth noting that you don't have to store your funds in that node for it to be worthwhile.
Some wallets (I'm using samourai), allow you to use your node as a tether to the blockchain. I run a bitcoin core node on my computer that's always running, and then my phone can connect to it over the internet. This way I don't need to trust a third party like with electrum, but I also get the convenience of a mobile wallet.
Running a node without storing funds in it is also very helpful to the network. It's just not going to help you personally in any way.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:32:54
Bitcoin is open source...
Anyone can contribute including you. If you have a great idea, then go make it happen.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:32:36
peer to peer doesn't have to be *direct*. You can use other peers for discovery and routing.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:15:55
I think appealing to an authority in this scenario is just as bad as in the cryptocurrency space.
It would be far better if every individual learned basic statistics and the scientific method and verified research themselves.
It would be far better if every individual learned basic economics and political theory and made the Brexit decision for themselves.
It would be *far* better if every individual learned critical thinking, and frequently forced themselves to confront their's and other's malformed opinions.
I'm not saying that this is how the world is currently, but it would definitely be superior.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:47:28
That's assuming you'd still use the exchange's virtual wallet, just with built in lightning transfers.
The better solution is to keep all of the coins in your own wallet, but still be able to trade on an exchange without having to deal with confirmation time. If an exchange operated with everyone using external wallet now, then everything would grind to a halt, and you'd be trading promises instead of actual bitcoin.
Lightning would allow instant verifiable transfers of wealth that the exchange can be sure about, and in terms of crypto-crypto trades, the exchange never even has to touch the coin. Cross-chain atomic swaps allow direct transfer of different coins.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:45:59
Seriously. Even comparing it to the stock market is silly.
Bitcoin isn't just an investment, it's a technology. It's not about buying and selling; it's about switching from fiat.

@_date: 2017-12-25 06:10:34
There are no alternatives. Other coins have lower fees and empty mempools because they also lack users.
They would end up with the exact same problems if all bitcoin users switched.
Increasing the block size won't even solve the problem for a day IMO. As soon as there's more room, more transactions will happen immediately to push fees up to the same amount.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:55:48
Bitcoin is too smart to fail.
It doesn't need to be rescued by some government because its success and security is defined by it's DNA (protocol).

It's still beta software TBH. It will keep getting faster, more secure, and just overall better as time goes on.

Your qualms with the "instant" comment are silly and don't matter.

You can effectively buy a degree. Scientists aren't and shouldn't be judged by their pedigree but their contribution to the scientific community at large.
If a nobody from India without a degree posts good research do you dismiss it because they don't have any authority? NO! You replicate it and attempt to verify it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:00:18
If anyone thought that they *actually* meant instantaneously, then they don't really understand the topic.
It was obvious and perfectly acceptable hyperbole.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:33:05
Do you mean finding a hash collision?
You can
1. make a new message
2. add a nonce at the end
3. check if the hash = the signed hash
4. if not change the nonce and try again.
If you have a message that hashes to the exact same result as the signed message, then you can use the exact same encrypted hash as your signature.
It's kind of like what bitcoin miners are doing, but instead of trying to find *any* hash that has a certain number of leading zeroes, you're looking for the *exact* same hash. This is *much* harder.
It would take basically forever (as you demonstrated), and the nonce at the end would be very suspicious.
You could also try to find out what the private key is, but that would take even longer.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:56:25
Recently, banks are the ones causing the crisis.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:03:01
The problem isn't that it was on a computer, the problem was that the encrypted  private keys needed to be exposed in some way (directly or indirectly) to an API. APIs are much easier to crack than AES.
As long as you take precautions, and you aren't an idiot, hot wallets are perfectly safe (assuming they're coded well).
Hardware wallets increase the chances of you losing your keys, so it's a trade off.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:30:52
That would reduce 16.8m to 12.8m and 21m to 17m to make the percentage 66%
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:02:42
It's a double edged sword. You also gain complete freedom and autonomy from banks, so you don't have to trust or cooperate with them if you don't want to.
Lack of charge backs is also an excellent property for vendors to prevent fraud.
It's all in how you look at it. Bitcoin will change the way people view and handle money IMO for the better.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:01:01
Bitcoin is like tcp or udp, not a company.

@_date: 2017-12-05 22:02:54
There's a reason it hasn't replaced fiat yet, and that's because it's not finished.
Bitcoin is still in beta. Let it improve over time. 
Within the next year we'll see a fix for the TX fees in the form of the lightning network. Other fixes are being experimented with as well including drivechains like RSK, improvements to the lightning network, and size decreases on transactions in the block.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:59:42
The more miners and nodes there are, the less centralization there is. If the miners and users all split into separate coins, then decentralization is also split. Each individual coin would be less secure and more centralized.
I have no problem with other coins. They are great for slightly more risky innovation, like Zcoin. However, I have a lot of problems with anyone who says other coins are "better", or they've "solved the scaling problem". Bitcoin is the only coin with a scaling problem because it's the only coin with scale. No alt-coin comes close to bitcoin in value or TX/s.
Bitcoin is the first coin to encounter these problems, and it will be first coin to fix them. It's the most trusted coin because it's the most proven and because it has the most brain power behind it.
It's not ready for public consumption yet, and that bums me out, but you can't rush something like this and expect it to actually work afterwards. We're talking about billions of dollars here, not a couple days of downtime and some bad PR.

It's almost like users of bitcoin don't like submitting to central authority!
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:02:00
To sign it, you encrypt a hash of the message using your private key. Then anyone can decrypt it using the public key and verify the hash, but no one else can encrypt anything for that corresponding public key unless they know the private key.

It's like saying China's intranet is better than the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:09:15
Yes, but I use this to prevent that. 
Not sure about a windows equivalent. I'm sure that there's a program out there that lets you rate limit each program/port separately.
That script just limits bitcoin traffic(all traffic over port 8333) to 160kbits or less, except over the local network.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:33:18
It's just another currency that is literally better in every single way (or soon will be).
No central point of failure.
No trusting banks, governments, or visa.
Much less prone to fraud for vendors due to no chargebacks.
Easy and safe to store bitcoin without having to trust a bank. Just put your keys in a safe, and/or backup your encrypted wallet in the cloud.
It's more private than fiat stored in banks now, and it will become even more private in the future.
And these are just the properties that relate to money. Bitcoin has a ton of other applications when clever developers get their hands dirty. Like digital deeds to property than can be instantly and securely traded fraud free.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:04:58
This doesn't mean they are inflating prices or anything.
It just means that more people are willing to pay more for bitcoin on those specific exchanges.
It's possible that the massive influx of new users on coinbase drove the demand and therefore the price up.

And route through the thousands of other channels. This means you only need a few channels to be able to reach *anyone* else on the lightning network instantly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:33:24
It would be smarter to have fees based on the balance of the channel. If a transaction makes the channel more balanced (each side has an equal amount of btc), then it's valuable to you, so you should charge less for it. If a relayed transaction makes your channel less balanced, then you should charge more.
The amount of fee would be based on the impact the transaction has on the balance of the channel.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:40:54
IOTA isn't proven yet. It might be better and work, but it's uncertain. Bitcoin has proven itself for almost a decade though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:29:47
They need to programmatically pay the thousands of miners. They can't type in a password everytime someone needs to cash out.
This means that the password needs to be exposed somewhere. The safest thing would probably to have the server send requests to a smaller more secure server that houses the wallet. The smaller server would take the request and send a bitcoin transaction.
This smaller server could be heavily locked down and inaccessible except for this API. No matter how secure it is though, if the API is compromised, then a hacker could just send a request to the smaller server that steals all the bitcoin. The smaller server would just see it as a normal cash out, and process the request like normal.
So when it comes down to it, an online "wallet service" is only as secure as their server. It doesn't gain any security by being associated with bitcoin.
That said, The smaller server could have easily had validation that made a withdrawal of the entire wallet like this impossible. That validation was probably either compromised or buggy, and it allowed the hack.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:32:47
Ideally lightning will replace bitpay and square, not improve them.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:07:52
You won't just make one huge channel like that (you probably won't even be able to). You'll make like 5 or more smaller channels. If one gets closed, then you'll be out a maximum of a 1/5 of your funds.
It won't be locked up for long either, just an hour or two plus the confirmation time.

Friendster can be instantly replaced, but the bitcoin network is the most secure because it has the most miners and the most nodes.
Unless almost everyone switched immediately then it's going to be hard to make something more secure than bitcoin, especially because people tend to place more trust in a tried and true system. When it's money at stake, people like taking unnecessary risks even less than normal.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:27:36
Making new blockchains is fine with me. I'm just tired of all the FUD trying to claim that bitcoin is like the myspace of cryptocurrencies. Replacing a website is easy, but replacing the internet is almost impossibly difficult. Bitcoin is similar.

Also bitcoin is inflationary right now lol
EDIT: I was wrong. Inflation isn't directly related to the money supply, but changing the money supply is usually how governments control it for their economy.
Inflation just means that each monetary unit (dollar or bit/satoshi) can buy fewer goods and services than before.
Deflation just means that each monetary unit can buy more goods and services than before.
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:52:07

I feel like using a service to temporarily hold your bitcoin for you until you're online would be fine. They'd send you an LN payment right when your node becomes available, so the counter party risk would be minimal. People rely on banks or services like paypal for that now, so it would actually be a massive improvement.
@_date: 2018-06-02 05:02:13
What bugs me about that whole thing is that blockchains aren't really the important part of bitcoin at all. Git is a better example of "blockchain technology".
Bitcoin, and crypto currencies in general, are revolutionary due to the interaction between validating nodes and POW nodes that solves the byzantine generals' problem. The closest slogan would be "mining technology" or something like that.

Were you aware that youtube has been losing money for years?
They need a source of revenue to literally stay afloat. Creators don't pay them, advertisers do. Even though the creators make all of the value on the platform, the advertisers are more important in the short term. If all their major advertisers pull out at once for too long, then they start to haemorrhage money extremely quickly, and they're already struggling to break even (and failing).
They've tried other ways too, that's what youtube red is. They wanted to reduce their dependence on advertisers and increase their revenue via subscriptions, but it didn't really catch on.
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:23:21
Yeah. I'm sure youtube would rather take a hands off approach, but the pressure from the advertisers is making them do some pretty stupid stuff (both for youtube as a company and for creators).
Controversy makes advertisers uneasy, so youtube is trying to prevent more WSJ articles titled "youtube showing soft core porn to kids" and such.
The demonetization is so that advertisers won't complain about their ads being shown next to content they don't like.

If there's a way to achieve decentralized consensus without using a lot of power, then that would be way better.
You don't have to be a tree hugger to care about the environment. In fact, I think you'd have to be an idiot to not be worried about the potential threat of climate change. That has more to do with how we generate power than what we do with it though, so I don't think stopping POW is any kind of solution at all. Gaming computers aren't useful like bitcoin, and no one is calling for stopping their use even though they use a lot of energy.
Solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, nuclear energy. Those are some solutions, and it so happens that bitcoin mining is the most profitable where those sources are plentiful.

Lightning is extremely secure, but if someone hacks your computer, then they'd get access to your LN wallet and all the funds in it, so your individual wallet is only as secure as the system its running on.
This is pretty similar to a bitcoin wallet, but lightning requires constant access to your private key, so if they have access to your computer, they wouldn't need a separate password to unlock the funds.
Wallets on mobile phones probably won't have this issue because they won't be online as often, not to mention that smart phones are very secure, so it probably wouldn't be a problem anyway.

Wouldn't IOTA be vulnerable to an attack where someone sends tons of small transactions to as many random recipients as they can from many nodes on different branches of the tangle, which would make the tangle extremely large even if you only download the paths relevant to you?
This would make bandwidth and storage costs so high that decentralization would be impossible.
I also feel like the algorithm that selects which transactions to verify could be manipulated unless everyone downloaded the entire tangle, which would be even larger than the whole blockchain because there's nothing limiting the number of transactions like the limited block size of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:37:54
it's the lightning network, not the lightning payment channel.
You'll probably be able to send funds to *anyone* with just one channel to a well connected hub.
With around 5 channels, you'll never really have to worry about a channel closing, or a hub not cooperating or being connected enough.
That's 5 on-chain transactions for potentially infinite transactions (if you let others route through your node to re-balance your channels)

I'm super hyped about things like patreon becoming super easy.
I'm sure many more ways than just the subscription and donation models will be possible with the negligible fees and instant processing of the LN.
Voting for features on an open source project and backing your vote with BTC to give it more weight is a good one. Same idea with an idea for a video that a youtube creator makes, or a song an artist releases.
Crowd sourcing will be actually possible because there won't be such terrible fees or crazy costs and red tape to setup to receive payments from people.
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:38:53
I'd say the primary value proposition is that bitcoin can't be seized, frozen, or devalued by a government.
It has clearly defined rules that don't change unless you want them to. You don't have to trust a financial institution or a government, but you still maintain most of the benefits that they provide. That's extremely valuable, especially given the track record of banks and small governments.

A channel is only a 2 way street between two people, but if one person has multiple channels, then they could agree to forward a payment on to someone else, and then someone else, and so on.
Your lightning client will find the shortest/cheapest path to the destination through the thousands of interconnected nodes. You only need to make a few channels, and then you will be able to send money to a ton of people.

Bitcoin has inherent value by being able to be spent on immutable public messages stored on the blockchain.
You can use this property for tons of things, but one of the cool ones is to prove that you own a car or something. You sign a message with the bitcoin address that currently owns the car on the blockchain, and then you prove that you own it. You can then trade the car's ownership like normal bitcoin, so you get transfer of ownership that is very fast, and can't be faked.

@_date: 2017-11-18 22:02:41


Depends on how much they charge in fees, and how many other people are connected to them. Each node can set whatever fees they want, so if one payment hub starts charging fees that are too high, or otherwise isn't perfect (asks for identification or something), then competition will arise immediately.
We probably won't even need these massive payment hubs, because most payments won't be more than like $20 worth, and most people can create a few channels of just $20 or $30 bucks. These channels can then be reused the other direction when all the money is on one side, so the network would theoretically be able to balance itself quite nicely. Multiple payments could also be used if $20 isn't enough.


No. Each intermediary can close any channel at any time without disrupting the payments that have already happened. They can also keep them open for as long as they like.
You can't use bitcoin that is locked in a channel until you close it though, except for transfers using that channel obviously.

For most people, Segwit support in bitcoin core *is* GUI support. I don't think it's a terribly tabloid title in that regard.

You can pay any fee you want. Higher fees get precedence by miners because the miners are the ones who receive the fees. Higher fees means a higher payout, so they prioritize high fee transactions.
Low fees(but still reasonable) will still make it through eventually when there aren't as many transactions, so the high fee ones don't take up all the space in a block.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:14:56
It's definitely an unfair comparison.
Coinbase and samourai are completely different things it's 100% apples to oranges.
Saying that the samourai wallet doesn't have an open release is just wrong though.
[You just download it here]( like any other app ever. TBH I think they are just being extremely conservative with their versioning. They don't want people to blame them for their own stupidity I guess, but samourai wallet is very functional and secure.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:02:28
Depends on how you define value I guess. I'm defining a valuable lightning node as one that is highly inter-connected and that has a high limit for payments for each connection.
It's definitely possible to have a valuable node that doesn't meet these criteria because it routes around a specific bottleneck. In general though, these criteria are why people are worried about massive payment hubs in LN.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:58:26

I don't understand. You can set completely custom fees in bitcoin core...
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:20:41
Opening a channel requires a quite large(high fee) transaction, and then closing it to get your funds requires another.
You could always allow others to route over that channel though, and you could reuse it in the future.
Running a hub should be really easy. I think there will be an automatic and GUI based way to do it with a lightning client.

There are miner fees, but you only pay them to set up a lightning channel, not to send transactions over it.
You would only need to pay miner fees very rarely when you need to open up a new channel.

Don't do a hard shutdown/reboot without closing the program and waiting for it to actually close. Running out of battery would do this too I think.
You could write a script that automatically shuts down your laptop when it gets to too low of power, that would prevent the hard shutdown from running out of battery.
@_date: 2018-03-12 07:34:17
You can't really do a similar thing as most Bitcoin SPV wallets because you need access to clear keys to renew a channel. That would give the server the ability to spend your money. If you need to be contacted to renew the channel anyway, then there's not much point in the server.
Connecting to a personal node makes sense though yeah.
I think it will be very feasible to run a node on your phone if you use a third party service that checks for old state broadcasts for you.
I'm sure there will be hubs willing to open channels with long nLockTime contacts too, which will make it less of a risk.

Nodes validate the rules and reject blocks that don't follow them.
If a miner decides to change the rules, but most of the nodes reject their block, then it's like they never mined anything at all.

How does your newly online wallet know who to notify about coming back online? You'd have to know who was trying to send you money.
It would also require the sender to be online when you come back.
I think places like coinbase are going to handle this. They'll hold the money for you, and then immediately send it to you once you come back online. The third party risk is basically nothing unless you stay offline for weeks, but you'd still sacrifice privacy.

The larger point is when a fiat currency as a whole begins to crumble. This is why America had to "bail out the banks" a few years ago, and why the Venezuelan currency is worthless now. Bitcoin solves these issues by not relying on banks.

look up nice hash, it's basically plug and play

Sure, you could use other LN nodes to do this, but then the privacy granted by onion routing goes out the window, because the node(s) that are used will know who is sending a payment, and where it's going.
That node that you use could also refuse to update the sender about your online status. You could use multiple nodes, but then you're sacrificing even more privacy, and privacy and censorship resistance go hand in hand.
The bad part about this, is that you couldn't turn it off if you didn't want the risk to privacy. You could tell other nodes that you don't want to do this, but they don't have to listen, so as long as the sender of the payment and some node you have a channel with don't care about your privacy, then you don't have a choice in risking it.

It would be worth the money to take your drive to a professional to do file recovery.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:37:19
Compare that to the ACH which takes 1-2 days. Or PayPal, which costs much more

My point is that they don't have anywhere near as much leverage as a normal mugging.
In a normal mugging the mugger can kill you and still just take the money, but with Bitcoin they need you alive for the mugging to have a point at all. They could torture you, but it would take longer, and cause more of a commotion.
@_date: 2018-07-03 04:14:19
I think that's the term yes.

That's probably why he developed a whole standup routine for the question lol.
@_date: 2018-07-02 11:59:57
I think the CAP theorem proves this yeah?
A distributed trustless system requires partition tolerance, so you can either have consistency or availability on top of that.
Availability would be scaling, and consistency would be consensus.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:08:12
You can't have fast turnaround and decentralized governance at the same time.
Being conservative to change is one of the reasons bitcoin is so secure.

How does someone subscribe when you're offline?
You'd have to use a third party.
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:44:52
You interact with third parties by routing on the LN, but you don't need to trust any of them with your money or even your information.
It's like saying that you're using a third party to drive to work because other drivers are stopping at stop lights for you.

An LN channel is just a (special) bitcoin address. In order to put money in, you need to send it to that address on-chain just like normal.

Wubba lubba dub dub!

Was tested on the litecoin network.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency in existence though, so their actual statement is false.
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:50:16
for a 100 question test it's (3/4)\^100 that you'd randomly get them all wrong.
which is 1 in 3 trillion.

They put up a massive amount of collateral in BTC in order to do the job, and I believe the DAO can take that as punishment.
Right now it is pretty centralized yeah. That will get better as more people use it and join the DAO, and either way, it's worlds better than anything else right now.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:29:18
I know that, but there's a definite advantage to actually testing on a main net.
Bitcoin isn't centralized, so public and easy to understand proof that an upgrade is secure is important for consensus.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:53:56
This system is much easier to enforce in a decentralized way because it relies only on the timestamps of each block. Mined blocks with weird timestamps can be rejected as they're created, and it's impossible to forge enough blocks to change anything. Realtime difficulty adjustment would require some sort of oracle measuring the hashrate, which is terrible for privacy and decentralization.
Remember that the fee market also keeps things steady. If mining is taking much longer than normal, then fees will go up due to the competition of getting into the next block, which will increase because transactions will start to build up and getting in the next block is more important because it takes longer. Higher fees makes mining more profitable despite higher difficulty. More profitable mining means more miners will join and decrease the time to find each block.
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:30:31
Well, as long as some people somewhere in the world are mining the network remains secure and functional. Taking away the internet and electricity of the entire planet would definitely destroy bitcoin, but it would also destroy just about everything else in modern society including banking systems.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:47:24
You can buy a smartphone, and there's satellite internet, but you can't just set up an entire (traditional) banking system. That requires a functional government that cares about your interests.
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:56:36
Get a small solar panel and a satellite dish, and you're set. You couldn't mine, but you could still send bitcoin no problem.
You can also trade signed transactions offline, then the recipient can broadcast it the next time they have access to internet/satellite. It still has a smaller risk of fraud than visa, especially because if it's so hard to transmit the transactions, double spending is much harder.

Everything else on that website is great too. Don't confuse it with bitcoin.com which sucks. I'd recommend watching [Andreas Antonopoulos]( as well. He explains things really well, and he's very trustworthy.
This Casa Node is actually a lightning network node too, so it allows you to make and receive lightning payments which are faster and cheaper than normal bitcoin payments. You can run a lightning wallet on your phone, but running a node 24/7 allows for better privacy because you can allow payments to be routed through it. If you route payments, then it's impossible to tell whether you're just routing someone else's payment or making one yourself.
Normally it would be more risky to run a lightning node on a computer than your phone because of viruses and stuff, but since this is a pre-configured box, it should be even better than your phone (assuming the company knows what they're doing and you follow the instructions).
