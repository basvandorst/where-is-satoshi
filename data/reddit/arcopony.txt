If Bill Gates came along to invest in my small business, he'd only put in maybe $50k, perhaps even $100k if he really believed in me. He wouldn't pay a cent more not because he'd think my business sucked or couldn't work, but because that's pretty much the maximum investment my particular business could use to take off. Anymore money would just sit around unused. Likewise that kid that invested his entire life savings of 50 cents isn't going to suddenly make my business explode because that was his life savings. 
Just because you have money doesn't mean you throw around it where it's not needed. You don't overfill a car's gas tank. 
Li Ka-Shing saw bitpay and thought $2.7m was all it needed to optimize its growth. So what if it's pocket change to him? It's what he thinks will make bitpay great, not a penny more.

you're off to a good start, but you might want to also include why I would want to use bitcoin (a new currency) as opposed to an existing and highly established currency (dollars). I think your logic might be turned on itself if you don't explain more.

I don't know about the first part, it might be that IQ is the result of high wealth, as not worrying about your next meal, good education, and stable finances foster the development of high IQ. 
As for rich countries adopting bitcoin, that might be from simply having more of the infrastructure to support it. Like computers and the internet.
As usual, "correlation does not equal causation".

I read you should continually use different addresses as you work with bitcoin, both to protect your own privacy and the privacy of those you deal with.
Say I want to set up an address to continually receive bitcoins, like a donation address on a youtube video. I can't change it for every person since I can't change the video after i upload. Is there a way to still maintain privacy of those i deal with when i ultimately sweep the address and use the coins?

but if someone can generate the addresses from the public HD key, would they also be able to check all those addresses and see how much was received? Would that also essentially kill privacy just as much as a single public address?

Your original post implies bitcoin is going to be the driving force for this revolution... that's what i find unlikely. For that to happen bitcoin would have to use a significant portion of electric power for the money to be made off it to have a significant impact on energy generation research. Energy research is one of *the* biggest money sinks in current science. Any new advancement is quickly exploited to its maximum potential by existing industries. Just look at the disgusting amounts of money being pumped into fuel cell research, a technology that so far has not produced a domestically viable unit for the average person.
What technologies has the banking sector put out? not much, even though they handle trillions of dollars.
I don't see bitcoin miners financing their own research labs, they use the existing power grid and existing power technologies. Sure they might order their own generators in the future, but developing something experimental like fusion is far too long-term for bitcoin mining that needs to have predictable profit margins on a monthly basis. 
Energy companies do their own scientific research. They can absorb the uncertainty that research beings. For them to spend more money on research, they have to sell more power to pay for it. So for bitcoin miners to seriously impact energy generation research they need to buy LOTS of power. Are bitcoin mining operations going to consume billions of dollars per month of electricity in the future to make a significant impact on energy costs? They'd have to make hundreds of billions in profits in order to justify spending that much electricity. And that's just to have an impact.
For your "massive leaps" in research we'd have to start throwing around truly disgusting amounts of money into electricity for mining.

What about existing uses of power? like for manufacturing, lighting, heating, transportation, etc.etc.etc. Is bitcoin going to be so energy intensive that it will displace the existing uses as the primary consumers of power?
If not, i don't see bitcoin impacting the overall pathway of energy research and engineering. Yes, bitcoin mining will continue to grow, but you're talking about seriously competing with the very infrastructure of civilization for power usage.

I'm just joking how the price of btc on gox, if plotted over the time scale from last October, kinda resembles a bubble at the beginning and gets popped at the end, falling back to previous levels and perhaps even below. Of course there are other factors at play here and this is not the behavior of a functional exchange. There does not appear to be bubble like behavior in any of the other functioning exchanges so we can safely regard mtgox as an anomaly.

ideally, in the future, bitcoin should be so ubiquitous, so common and so integrated with everything that it is boring. It should simply be there, reliable, consistent, predictable and trustworthy. We shouldn't need to fully understand it or even bother thinking about it. It should be so part of our everyday finances, from currency, to stocks, to property ownership that we take it for granted. It should simply be... money. Money that lets us focus our time in pursuit of enlightenment, personal growth and happiness.

Like i said i see your point. My bigger concern is if i'm unable to remember how to retrieve the key. Any new scheme i come up with will be a "late" memory in my head and will be the easiest to go as my disease progresses. So i should make it as easy to figure out as possible. But at the same time, the thief would also have an easy time of it. So i need to make it harder to figure out, but then if its complicated i may forget critical parts. It's a difficult problem to resolve.
But in the end, this is all speculative anyway, the chances of any successful reanimation is likely extremely low. I'll just have to accept whatever memory loss comes with it, compounded with my own loss from alzheimers.

Try a few examples.
At the bank, there are accountants who sole job is to check over the numbers and the transactions to make sure all the bank's books are accurate and up to date. To reward them for this very important job they are payed their salary.
"Mining" is actually closer to that than digging for gold. A "miner" essentially checks over the transactions in the bitcoin network and makes sure they are correct and up to date before adding them to the "book" (the blockchain). Multiple miners double check each other to ensure no one is hacking or cheating. Just like how multiple accountants may double check the bank books to ensure no one accountant is doing bad things.
To pay these miners for their very important job they are paid in transaction fees and newly minted bitcoins.

So i don't have my coins, but i'm alive.
I think you're completely missing the point. I want to LIVE. If I save every bitcoin, but die and don't get reanimated, what's the point? I value my life more than i value my bitcoin, even if i had 20 million of them.  If the future cryonicists are evil and kill me and hack my brain well there is nothing i can do to stop that. But if they are not then i'd rather spend my bitcoins and live as long as possible than die rich. 
And as i already said, it wouldn't matter, i suffer from alzheimers so i can't use a brainwallet. I can't bring the coins with me. But i'm ok with that if i can live again in the future cured of my disease. I'm happy to start life anew with a clean slate, even if that means a clean account too.

Connect to other users and upload whatever you data you like. It's encrypted with your key so no one can read it. You then pay with bitcoins for its upkeep and replication. Stop paying, it'll eventually evaporate.
alternatively, if you have large amounts of space to spare and don't mind the bandwidth usage, you can offer your space and get paid a modest fee.

equilibrium will be reached where the cost of electricity and difficulty is too high to mine profitably, reducing electricity consumption as miners go offline or convert to more efficient hardware. 
On the flipside electricity itself is a technological advancement that continues to advance as the demand for it increases. Scientists and engineers love throwing money at energy generation research so the efficiency and quantity of energy generation continues to improve, reducing rates.
Finally actual mining electrical energy consumption is miniscule compared to other uses. Manufacturing, lighting, transportation, heating, industrial etc. are HUGE compared to bitcoin mining and will still be huge for the foreseeable future. Even if bitcoins are worth millions of dollars and become a world currency it is unlikely the power that mining consumes will ever put a dent in the existing uses of electricity. It is THOSE uses that ultimately dictate the overall availability of electricity.

i don't know very much about how it all works. But i heard there is a 1 megabyte per block limit. since blocks are produced on average every ten minutes, this imposes a limit on how fast the block chain can grow.
Once the size limit is reached, the miners can choose to only include transactions with fees added. if there is still an overwhelming surge in transactions, then the miners will prioritize higher fees per transaction.
So a spammer will have to burn a lot in fees just to max the size. Once they run out of money, the attack is over.
As for raising the limits, those proposals carry there own set of pros and cons. I'll let someone with a better understanding of what they are to explain them.

Right now you're competing in a market where the first movers have the biggest advantage. And you're offering the same thing as every other exchange except with less depth, less history, and as such, less trust. So its going to be very hard to break-in unless you're willing to tough it out for the long haul (maybe years) or offering something substantial to the other exchanges.
MtGox was so hard to dethrone because it was first mover and because it was the biggest exchange everyone thought it was better to trade there for best depth. The other exchanges might have offered slightly better rates, but traders were already at MtGox. its a chicken and egg problem.
Eventually, a service came along that was substantially different, bitcoinica. Now i know it turned out to be the biggest scam but on the surface we can still conclude that they got their user base because they did stuff MtGox wasn't doing, margin trading. Even though it was a bucket shop with shoddy security we can still learn from them. If you offer something substantially different, people will take notice.
Ultimately, MtGox was only brought down not because the other exchanges offered anything substantially better, but because MtGox screwed up on such an epic scale that traders HAD to move. Bitstamp has now rapidly rising to be the big exchange because they toughed it out and grew organically, absorbing the burned traders from mtgox.
Now BTCChina is also a rising star because they directly connect with the nearly untapped Chinese market (which is far, FAR bigger than the canadian market) and they have 0 fees. The fees make them especially attractive for day traders.
What does Vault of Satoshi have? Better service? That might be great, but that's something that people only recognize after the long haul.
You have more currencies? there were other exchanges for those currencies before you came along, are you offering any substantially different as opposed to those exchanges? no? Then you'll have to wait for your reputation to build up.
In the end, begging people for 5% of their trade volume isn't going to work out. I don't doubt your honesty, but you're not doing anything that entices people to give up what already works. Users will gradually come in if you continue to offer good, reliable service, but you gotta be patient with that.
Alternatively, offer something substantially different.
have ya guys looked at bitfinex and seen how they done margin trading?
If you could implement something like that, faster, more features, less annoying and less buggy, you'd have something very few other exchanges have.

Anyone that has to *ask* if they should mine, or if mining is profitable, doesn't know enough about mining to make it profitable for them. For it to be profitable at this point you need large capital investments and direct lines to ASIC manufacturers. There is also the logistics of bringing all that hardware online. 
But, if you had those things, you'd already be smart enough and capable enough to determine if you could mine profitably.
Bottom line, if you need to ask about mining, you won't be able to turn a profit on it.
Thus why the universal answer of "no" when people ask. 
Those that can turn profit, aren't asking.

Very good suggestions! thanks!
As for journalling, i'm not sure any medium would reliably last into the future. 
Physical storage is good, but its unlikely i could save any physical thing other than my own brain into the future. 
Any cloud storage system would require periodic activity to maintain the account. I once lost a hotmail account that was important to me because i didn't log in every year. 
Journalling still sounds like a good idea though if i can find a reasonable means of sending it to myself in the future.

i'm not an economist, but i think bitcoin is slightly different in that the utility and usefulness of bitcoin for even simple functions like international remittance allows for a stable price in the hundreds, thousands, or perhapes tens of thousands range. The deflationary aspect further increases the stable price.
Tulips on the other hand can be produced given enough time and resources, and thus inflated to meet demand. The stable price would be much more in line with production costs. So a very high price that far exceeds the cost to make it is a clear sign of a bubble.
I do think bitcoin will have lots of *volatility* but if bitcoin really does replace even one of the existing markets it can be used in, I don't think it's a *bubble* in the larger sense.

I'm glad we cleared this up. I do realize i probably should have worded my statements better. I admit i'm not a very good writer or communicator. And communicating the nuances of one's own personal belief system is very difficult and easily misconstrued, especially since such systems can rarely be described in single sentences. My apologies.
To clarify, while i do believe/accept/like/tolerate certain things, i'm not asking anyone to agree or accept. I'm not looking to teach/preach my ideals. There is so much i don't know that i find the best policy is just to ask. But no question exists in a vacuum, and to properly answer you need to know a little about what the person asking thinks. Answering a child is different from answering an adult (unless its ELI5 :P), thus why i explained where i was coming from a bit, how i'm fine with my existing government etc., but i honestly was not trying to preach an ideal. I apologize if i came across as such.

the earth isn't unlimited though. So you still have the "limited supply" part of your argument. Just because we don't know when, doesn't mean it's unlimited. 
And we do have a hard limit of the total mass of the earth. Obviously the actual limit amount of gold is going to be less. There are some scientific estimates of the amount of gold remaining based on geological data. They're still estimates subject to change but the numbers aren't unlimited.

research "change addresses" and how they're lumped with other transactions as you continuing using your wallet. It's this lumping that associates addresses, inserting dust into the wallet encourages lumping. slight better than monitoring the blockchain alone.

@_date: 2013-12-30 22:52:37
Yeah i was going from the perspective of a country that was near the bottom of the barrel in terms of financial health. In such cases bitcoin can stand on its own.
I suppose if the country has a working banking system with a somewhat stable currency, then good exchanges would be an important part of bitcoin adoption. Mexico sounds like an excellent example of such a place.
As for localbitcoins, i don't mean that particular site specifically, but the concept of local individuals doing exchanges. In very poor countries, the majority of financial "banking" is done not with an actual bricks and mortar institution, but individual money changers and microlenders. in such places its usually some guy on their street that everyone goes to for "financial services". Even pawn shops and gold exchangers fall under this category.  People in those regions are familiar with this system and can assess trustworthiness for themselves. the money changers can make bitcoin part of their services.
Bitcoin can still work in developing countries, we just need to think of it in *their* system, rather than ours.

The tone is a holdover from the old days of TV broadcasting where the stations and companies needed to make sure their equipment was working before a broadcast. The most straightforward way at the time was to display a "title card" and play a tone at the source. Then the technicians at the various points along the chain, from the studio all the way to broadcaster, could see if the broadcast was working properly before switching over to the camera feed. 
It'd be pretty goofy if when they switched over the sound wasn't working... because they never tested the audio.
And thus the reason for the tone.
Like most government agencies they're probably still using the old Broadcast TV methodology and likely still use lots of the old TV equipment and just attached a video capture card for web streaming.
I remember way back in the early 1980s alot of regular TV stations would end the broadcast day and play the tone along with a title card from midnight to early morning.

Alright, sounds good! go for it!
I'm not so sure about a separate league though. Might be more straightforward to start with a league already giving out prizes and then to ask them to give some prizes in bitcoins. Starting with a prize, and thinking up ways to give it out doesn't seem like the best option. I think people like e-sports because they're sports, fun to watch and think about. The money attracts good players to make it more fun, but is rarely the basis for the tournament. I don't see leagues based around paypal or gold. 
(although granted, it's worked before, the nobel prizes started with lots of money, and then the prizes were created around it. We now know the prizes primarily for their objective, but still, it was made so Alfred Nobel could do something with his wealth.)
Ah well, go for it.

the digital wallet is based around a deterministic wallet (Armory and Electrum have such features). So it generates the private keys from a seed-key that is always the same. If i spend, receive, transact my bitcoins i draw from that key pool.
So the paper wallet is *just* the seed-key. Once its loaded into wallet client program the computer generates the private and public keys from it. Even if i lose the digital copies, i can restore from the same seed-key and it regenerate the same private keys.
So I only need make my initial paper  backup, and then copy it as many times as i like, assured in the knowledge that i'll always be able to get my wallet back, i don't need to update the paper even if i use more keys.

I don't know, i'm still studying bitcoin. But from what i've read i think the market forces will work to balance mining. If indeed too few miners mine, then the rest of the miners will collect a bigger share of the fees and make more profits, in turn this will attract miners back until a stable market equilibrium is reached. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:47:15
right now coins are about $1.10-$1.20 per mBit. so you can get a few dozen mbit or so for a decent price.
As for "getting into bitcoin" you have to ask yourself what's your objective. Do you want to make lots of money? Store value? buy stuff you like online? send money to relatives in another country? stick it to the government that you can do whatever you like with your money? Try something technical logically cool?
If you want to make lots of money... no one knows where bitcoin will go. It might go up even more, or it might not, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Store value? maybe, seems to be working well so far if you can avoid panicking whenever there is a price correction.
Buy stuff? now this is what bitcoin was meant for, if there is stuff you want to buy then go for it!
Send money to relatives in another country? this gets around a lot of issues with the current banking system, but your relatives also need to be bitcoin savy in order to exchange them for their local currency. So answers are variable for this one.
Stick it to the government? You decide.
Try something technologically cool? This is why i got in, at just a ~$1.2/mbit you can mess around for less than the cost of a video game.

if you include a reasonable fee, your transaction has a very high probability of being in the next block.
The time to the sixth "next" block (a complete confirmation) is targeted to be 60 minutes. But if mining hardware is brought online faster then the time to generate 6 blocks can be faster. As a bitcoin user you have almost no control over how fast this is, the combined power of the miners do.
If you really wanted to increase confirmation speed you'd bring online a huge amount of mining power when you make your transaction, hoping to increase the rate that the blocks are found.
Transaction fees alone just increase the likelihood of being put into the next block, but don't do much after that.

The idea is that the pixels are so small in real life that even a tiny distortion would misalign them enough to ruin reconstruction. So you'd have to have a very high resolution camera and hold it up perfectly aligned in order to capture the codes. Off by even a tiny bit and you can't reconstruct it later.
So its not quite as easy as "simply taking photograph and reconstruct the QR later".
Obviously if you stole the code and used a flatbed scanner then you could do it but in that case you'd just steal the code bitcoins directly.
Visual encryption prevents a casual attack like something whipping out their cellphone and photographing it over your shoulder while you show someone.

technically yeah...
But don't worry too much, bad random number generators are usually found pretty quickly (like the broken generator in the android OS a while back). And quantum computers that do this sort of thing are a long way off. So you can reuse addresses as much as you want... for now.
some of the biggest services containing huge amounts of coins do this all the time without problems.
And chances are, when quantum computers that can hack this do come online, there will be so much news about them that you'll move your coins to an unspent address before it becomes a problem.

Fully automated agents.
Right now a piece of software, say an online game, requires a human being to buy it hardware. With bitcoin, an autonomous agent could have its own wallet, and thus search out and pay for its own upkeep.
Think about it for a second, an autonomous agent with *its own wallet*.
We may eventually have services in the future run by software that runs and pays for itself. no need for even an *owner*. the software owns itself.
The only way to pay for its services is through bitcoin, as you can't open a bank account if you're not in some way human (a corporation can but its run by humans).

Ya say 100% is necessary, but you don't exactly specify *why*.
An uptime of 99.999% is about five minutes of downtime per year. Bitcoin is resilient enough that five minutes of downtime per year is not an issue. Heck there have been days when blocks took longer than an hour to confirm. If some downtime hits, the blockchain can easily be rescanned and transactions reloaded in the other 99.999% uptime.

I have no idea whats going on. checking the blockchain we can see the coin came from 1FFirnLctcZxVx5otnLNZ4dDGUkMBM4vNr
 and this address has been sending out huge numbers of of these small coins. Also, almost every address it sends to has already been used somewhere else. So its sending to known addresses that likely are still in use.
I don't know what for.

Even if this works perfectly it also means that its an easy way to steal someone's coins.

I'm not a computer programmer or cryptographer or mathematician. So someone correct me if i'm wrong:
You can receive as many payments as you want on as many or as few addresses as you want.
The only issue is when you might start *spending* them. If you spent from an address, it's good practice to empty that address and not use it to receive bitcoins again. You still can if you want to, but there is a remote possibility that some future development in computing will allow previously spent addresses to get cracked.
addresses are hashes of the private key and there are a couple layers of hashing to do this. It is practically impossible to determine the private key from the address even with a quantum computer. 
But as soon as you *spend* from an address, you have to create and sign a transaction that gets broadcast on the blockchain. Normally this transaction is carefully created from the private key along with some random numbers to make it very hard to determine what the private key was... but its easier now that there is a bit more information about the private key, information that did not exist before you created the transaction.
In fact, if the random numbers are weak, or repeated, the private key can be easily cracked and this has already happened with some addresses. To protect against a weak random number generator you never spend from the same key twice, two transactions that have the same random number in them can be cracked. (Obviously whatever bad random number generator used to sign the transaction is going to probably ruin your private key generator too but that's another problem for another time)
If the random numbers are good then its just about impossible to crack the private key... unless you have a quantum computer that can take multiple transactions and calculate the private key (even with good random numbers).
Quantum computers that can do this are a long way off. But someday it'll happen. 
So to keep your keys protected from bad random number generators or quantum computers for the foreseeable future its good practice to not reuse addresses that you have already spent from. Even a quantum computer has a very difficult time getting the private key from an unspent address.
I could be wrong though, i hope someone else will correct me on this.

so i read that private keys are pretty much impossible to brute force since the number is so large. something like 2^256
In going further i read that deterministic wallets produce a predictable sequence of known keys. But i read the seed for them might be smaller in size. like in electrum the seed is 2^128. 
Can the 2^128 entropy seed still generate enough keys to be as secure as randomly picking a 2^256 key? is there a possibility of overlap? 
is the danger of overlap still very *very* small to be inconsequential?
I'm guessing it is pretty much impossible to overlap and thus inconsequential, but i'm not good at math so i'd appreciate it if someone walked me through it.

I never said anyone could nor is that the issue. I'm asking is it acceptable. Just because someone can't stop me doesn't make it acceptable. No one can really stop me from cheating on my girlfriend, doesn't mean its acceptable for me to do so. 


Ofcourse its not the exact same thing, you're taking it too literally. The analogy was more if some other group built something for a particular purpose for a particular group of people then it would be impolite for a person who was not the intended user to use it. I'm sorry if the example i gave mislead you. 
How about this example: A bunch of us build a kids park for the kids in our neighbourhood and we make it clear that is its intended use. But a bunch of adult softball players move in and use the same park to practice softball everyday, keeping the kids out. It's not a handout this time.

Why would they be de facto remote locations?
I think we have a difference of definition. Please define "remote location". I don't define a whole country as a "remote location". But clearly we're not on the same page here. I define a remote location as a place distant ("remote") from another place.
I have friends in vietnam and cambodia that i regularly email. They have excellent connectivity despite being in third world countries, and being very remote from me.
Once again though, you're pushing a Nirvana Fallacy. We start with places that do have connectivity, and gradually move outward bringing the connectivity with it. 
Another nirvana fallacy is the implication that the certainty of downtime somehow stops the use of bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't die if you lose your connectivity, your transactions just get delayed or lost. But when it comes back online the system can process transactions again and you can rebroadcast if it was lost. So what if downtime is certain? That's irrelevant if the uptime makes up for it. The only systems where downtime is detrimental is systems that can't recover, like the life processes of a human body, any downtime is irreversible death. Bitcoin is not like that, it has incredible recovery capability and won't die just because it goes down for a few minutes, or even a few hours. As long as there is the certainty of *uptime* bitcoin can work. This obsession with zero downtime is a huge "perfect solution fallacy".

Nah, nothing to worry about at all.
The amount energy available to us is... VERY... large. It's in sunlight, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, geothermal, and more.
Sunlight alone drops ~170 petawatts on us for free. Human civilization, all the combined power plants from nuclear to waterfalls, uses about 16 terawatts. We don't even use a full 1% of what the sun gives us for free. We're just that pathetic in terms of technology.
And that's the kicker, what really defines our energy resources is not how much of them we have, but how efficiently we can use them. That's pure science and that is what improves every decade as people come up with better and better ways to get at energy.
All of our non-renewable sources could end tomorrow and while the hit would be dramatic we would recover and continue to grow our energy production and utilization capabilities. A hundred years ago cracking open an atom for power was a laughable fantasy. I'm quite hopeful a thousand years from now we'll unlock a lot more. 
Hey, just getting 1% of sunlight would be a monumental accomplishment.
Science, like bitcoin, gets better with age.

Do you still need a monitor, keyboard and mouse to use pi wallet?
If so then i see little advantage compared to getting armory on a netbook or very cheap laptop. the whole "fitting in the palm of your hand" thing about pi wallet is kind of misleading if it doesn't practically work that way. You may mean the software and private keys itself, but one can load linux onto an SDHC card and boot entirely off that while on the laptop. The SDHC card also "fits in the palm of your hand".
If you're going to swap your existing computer's monitor, keyboard and mouse (effectively disabling it) while you sign offline transactions in the Pi Wallet then you might as well get a high speed USB key, load linux and armory on it, and boot off that. Whatever malware might be crawling around in your main OS won't be loaded when you boot up linux. 
That all being said, i think Pi wallet would be great if it came with a shield that had a basic low-res display and a few buttons to confirm transactions. That would truly make the pi wallet standalone and functional. 
But if we have to supply the monitor, keyboard and mouse, might as well use an existing computer (either the online comp or another laptop) than go with Pi wallet.

As a trader, i'm going to selfishly say zero. :P
But i understand that as a bussiness you need something more sustainable. 
An extremely attractive fee structure is what [bitstamp]( uses, they charge slightly less (0.5%) than the leader (mtgox) and then change their fee based on value traded in dollars rather than BTC. So if you trade a few coins at the current price you can go into the next fee bracket just moving a few hundred dollars, rather than almost $50k at cavirtex. also, their lowest bracket (0.2%) is VERY attractive. 
Cavirtex's fee model might have been reasonable when bitcoin was $10-$50. But now that coins are ~$130 the cost of pushing through to the next fee bracket is horribly discouraging for new buyers and even experienced traders.

I hear ya,
I got other assets that would cover the $300k, but i didn't use them because selling them now and buying coins would incur fees and taxes. I got the loan because it was "cheaper" in the short term. If it goes down then i'll have to bite the bullet and take the loss, but if it goes up, i can repay the loan and only incur fees/taxes on the sale of the coins. 
You are right though, don't put in what you can't afford to lose. I *can* lose this, it would just hurt, but it wouldn't kill me.

The price would drop 10% or more.
The vast majority of people still don't understand what bitcoin is. But they do understand (or at least they think they do) what fiat money is. If given a bitcoin and told roughly that its money the first they'll want is to convert it into money they can understand and use. While bitcoin is very much usable, they don't understand that. They'll take that bitcoin and sell it as soon as they can to get the "money" out of it. Thus the price will decrease.
The size of the network has nothing to do with the price. The usage, buying and selling does. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:09:02
Short answer: No
Long answer: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO... and here's why: at the rate of difficulty increase you will never back the amount of coins you could have obtained by simply buying them directly. therefore it is more profitable to buy the coins and wait for them to rise. Even if they go down, you're STILL ahead of a miner who already spent money they can never recoup from the coins.

Although i think bitcoin is superior, I think MintChip will be a great bridge from the conventional fiat system to bitcoin. MintChip, being just a digital version of CAD, will help those individuals who are still blindly adherent to the properties of fiat (inflation, government backing, wide adoption/recognition etc.etc.etc.) to at least get into the concept of a digital currency.
After awhile of using it they'll look over at bitcoin and see how it behaves almost the exact same way (stored in digital wallets, transferable over the internet etc.etc.) but better (outside government control, deflationary, store of value...)
Then they'll switch, and bitcoin will be on top.
So don't knock the mintchip yet. Call it bitcoin for babies!

I thought the wonderful thing about bitcoin was that it was the value transfer system of the *internet*. You've essentially reproduced fiat banking through mail (i used to bank this way back in the day, i'm fucking old). Which is even less efficient than fiat banking online. 
With this system i completely lose the wonderful bitcoin features of instant transfer, tracking and frictionless transactions. 
Also this is far from "perfectly hacker proof" in that if someone hacks the *service* they can change the database and possibly change the ID and address info to their own. At which point they can ask for the coins to be mailed to them. It's going to be extra fun when i call in to get my coins back and the service says "you're not on file. But Mr. I.P. Freely is the true owner of those coins you claim!". 
If the service is secure enough that the database can't get hacked.... then why not store the coins directly on there? 
You set up the scenario that the service might be vulnerable so they can't store the bitcoins online and have to store it in cold storage, but invulnerable to having their user database hacked. Whatever techniques they have to make their user database invulnerable should be applied to the bitcoins.

I think the idea is *not* to try and exchange in places where banking is terrible. The existing financial infrastructure is so bad in those regions that people don't trust their currencies due to rampant corruption, instability and uncertainty. Bitcoin would become the currency of choice because of it would be comparatively more trustworthy and less prone to manipulation than the existing currency. Already in some parts of Africa cellphone minutes are used as currency. Bitcoin could be the next step up. Bitcoin would replace banks since you can store the coins yourself and transfer them anywhere, even internationally, right from anywhere that has connectivity. So there would be no need to have big centralized exchanges. If exchange is required though then smaller operations like the ones on localbitcoins could be used.
In our prosperous and heavily banked society with digital transfer like ACH, paypal, visa and interac we tend to think in terms of integrating bitcoin with it. While we like to lament our systems are terrible, in truth they are still very functional if a bit inefficient and corrupt.
But in these other regions the financial system is so much worse that bitcoin is orders of magnitude better. It's so far above that it is a *new* system entirely. Integrating it through exchanges would actually likely hinder it.

to paraphrase you: "That will only affect them, or, put another way, a single cluster in a network, not a system downtime affecting everybody who is part of the system in that instant of time and space."
To try and get bitcoin to work everywhere right off the bat I think is a bit too high of standard to shoot for. It would be easier to first implement in high connectivity areas first, and then move outward. If people see bitcoin is useful and they see a way to increase their business with it, they will create connectivity themselves. 
I think you have a bit of "Nirvana fallacy" going where you expect all solutions to be perfect 100% or you won't accept it at all. We don't necessarily need that, it just needs to be significantly better than existing systems, and it doesn't even needed to be implemented everywhere at once. Almost every big thing started small and grew outward.
Why does bitcoin need to be perfectly implemented in remote places? OP was actually asking for exchanges to be implemented in *developing* places, not "remote" ones.

Can I use bitcoins if i'm not a libertarian, anti-government or anti-bank?
I'm not really interested in bringing down the financial system or overthrowing any system. I keep hearing bitcoin is the currency for libertarians and anarchists but i'm not really interested in those philosophies. While i agree the existing systems have very large problems I respect and appreciate that they have worked to some extent under the circumstances for which they were created. I try not to attribute to malice what can usually be explained by incompetence. I want to use bitcoin because of its technical brilliance and I believe it's the future and an improvement to money in a digital age. I'm perfectly fine with continuing under my existing government (i live in canada). I respect and understand that others view the world differently, i just don't necessarily share the same views. Can i still use bitcoin despite being somewhat socialist?
EDIT: I realize i explained myself pretty badly. My apologies, obviously there is nothing physically stopping me from using bitcoins and there is no "Bitcoin Gestapo" after me. I'm asking more is it acceptable by the existing user base that i join in?
For example, if i'm a millionaire i can still go down to nearest homeless shelter and get a free meal. There is nothing stopping me, but it would be tremendously impolite for me to do so.  
I respect the bitcoin community and although i do not share most of its political views i don't want to ruin or taint something wonderful it has created. As a canadian socialist would it impolite/unacceptable to join in with the libertarians on this new financial project they have worked so hard to build? It's their creation after all, they have some say over a person like me that came late.

Now to answer the question: I would not sell. I would instead try to use my bitcoins directly to buy stuff.
If bitcoins dropped to a negligible value, then selling would be pointless.  A low value meant bitcoin failed to be adopted and no one wants it, or another cryptocurrency came along that was better so everyone abandoned bitcoin. 
If bitcoins maintained a very high value, that means they have successfully survived the adoption phase and become an accepted currency and unit of account. There would be no point to converting them to another currency.

I can't remember where i found the post, but i heard an idea/rumor/conspiracy/epileptic tree that this particular address was part of some larger scheme to track addresses by sending lots of coins out and then data mining the blockchain for when its spent. Chances are it'll get lumped with other addresses and thus you can associate the addresses as it goes. Associating a bunch of addresses together can help you find clusters of addresses that likely belong to the same entity. 
Of course, this is one of those "arguments from ignorance" in that we don't have any positive evidence either way what this is doing and why.

I don't know alot about bitcoins, but since they're software based, rather than physically existing, and perfectly fungible, wouldn't it be cheaper and more effective to simply store multiple copies (encrypted perhaps) of the wallets around the world?

If something were so bad as to incinerate the surface of the earth I think there would be bigger issues to worry about than bitcoins.

actually no, mining is not profitable unless you have the capital to purchase large numbers of custom made ASICs directly from the fab.
Mining is useful to the network, but that's a more academic point.
Don't try to mine bitcoins as an individual, just like its not a good idea to spend money and mine gold as an individual.
Just buy coins (or gold) directly.

Short answer: No
Long answer: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO... and here's why: at the rate of difficulty increase you will never back the amount of coins you could have obtained by simply buying them directly. therefore it is more profitable to buy the coins and wait for them to rise. Even if they go down, you're STILL ahead of a miner who already spent money they can never recoup from the coins.

I'm still saving up for cryopreservation. I'm not sure if i can make it to the cryo tube before i bite the dust but i'm going to give it a shot.
Let's say in the rosy "better than now" future reanimation is possible, i'll likely be a later candidate due to the brain damage. Alzheimers destroys memory as well as cognition, but it usually destroys late memory first, early "hard" memories, like childhood and family are considerably harder to go. My mother doesn't recognize me as her son right now, but she still recognizes my childhood photos. 
I'm hoping in the future my cognition will be fully restored, we'll likely know how brains work and what components are necessary for cognition. I'll settle with only fragments of my memory restored. I think i'm capable of rebuilding who i am if i still retain most of my early "hard" memories.
I'm more worried that if and when my disease becomes excessive, i may not know to communicate my intentions to be cryopreserved to my caregivers, or worse, they dismiss my requests as the ramblings of a senile senior citizen. At which point i'm buried when i die and never get the chance at being reanimated.
Brain reading in the future is a serious issue for brain wallets. Everything i can think of to mitigate that won't work in an uncertain future. The best i can think of is a trust company that keeps half the key while my brain keeps the other half. The problem is the company might fail before i'm revived. Most of the trust companies from the early 1900s are not around right now. And if a company did last that long into the future, they might be so radically different that they would not keep my records or use some future legal loophole to demand a high fee from me or even collude with the reanimation company to take my key.
Ah well, the future is wonderfully uncertain... which is why i want to go there when i die :)

There is no "bitcoin organization" just like there is no "gold organization" so asking how much revenue it makes is like asking how much revenue gold makes.

Like any organization, gold and bitcoin, revenue is used to pay employees, investors and to expand the company.

those are actually two separate questions.
Do they have the copyright? i don't think so, the original creator does. Even then the protocol is built with open source in mind and with a general public license, so anyone can add or use it for their own ends without needing to pay royalties. Bitcoin would never gave gotten as popular as it is if it had components that required licensing. So the protocol is effectively public domain.
the second question
Can they create a hard currency or visa type card? Anyone can, and many have, look up "physical bitcoins" and "coinkite".

if these prizes become popular, i can foresee a situation where whale bitcoin holders donate huge amounts to projects they control. They get their own coins back while at the same time creating the appearance the project is more popular or valued than usual.

"What's stopping someone from making a language more popular than english? would this not tank the english language?"
Basically, bitcoin got here first and everyone is using bitcoin first, its existing value is more attractive for new buyers, investors and users than a new currency with less adoption.
Now a new currency could take over if it had some awesome new features or abilities, like it was 51% attack proof, quantum proof, instant transaction, or had a strong value backed by (insert trusted entity) from day 1.
But so far, bitcoin is already here and beating it is going to require a revolutionary improvement (that can't be added onto the bitcoin code) rather than an incremental one.
Like a native language, a population would be VERY resistant to adopting a new language unless there was some major reason to do so. Like how smaller nations are adopting english because most of the internet uses it and there are no translations of popular websites available because their own language is too small.

I don't know much about how bitcoin works, but i think the math is still the same. If the miners had chips that performed the math incorrectly, the blocks would be universally rejected (because the numbers don't solve correctly) and the miners would figure out pretty quickly their hardware was a dud.
If the miners had chips that performed the math perfectly.... i don't see the problem. The blocks are accepted and everything works. 
If the chips insert different numbers to get different hashes (but still solved correctly) then maybe you could use that to trace which chip made the block and thus track the miner....
.... i'm not sure the miner would care too much if they were tracked as most miners just run their operation like a legit business and would freely admit "Yes! i'm mining!" 
The information you can leak out of the miner using tainted chips doesn't seem all that valuable.
Maybe if mining was banned then it would be an issue. Not sure i see that happening.

The solution i presented, putting the OS on the USB key, can also be "easily backed up, taken with you etc." just like the SD card, heck if you want, just load the linux build onto the SD card if you think the usb key is too cumbersome.
As for not having time to build or think of your own solution, if you expect the user to supply their own monitor, keyboard and mouse and assemble them in then that sounds like your expecting them to build a solution. if its the software part you're helping them with, then armory already has a fairly decent set of instructions for setting up ubuntu and armory and provide such links on their page.
The small display i think is your best bet, you solution would be very different and unique from asking someone to essentially assemble another computer to use your software.
