it's a little expensive but the taste and 18% alcohol is well worth it, haven't had a chance to try their others though

It's still special to me and fun to watch it grow, it's over $1 now, I'd like to invest when I actually have some money

And I thought my 25¢ tip was special 
@_date: 2013-12-28 07:27:56
I saw $1,000 tipped earlier today

I'm just looking for a person with more knowledge on the subject to give a constructive defense and hear what some people have to say. I constantly see Ponzi Scheme articles pop up, if the explanation to disprove it being a ponzi scheme is so simple why do these articles and arguments continue to arise?

Being a realist that makes sense, the tips that are real are still awesome though, the guy with the sign on espn comes to mind. Still seems like a very generous community overall.
