Cool, man. You can use it for anything you can use USD for, pretty much. But, that isn't very much, so have double that! 200 bits

Yes, I got .0001 (One Ten-Thousandth) of a Bitcoin. Specifically, 100 bits.

Just got my first bitcoins from the thread. Excited to be part of the community!

It is simple SI prefixes. It does require some math to understand, but it shouldn't be that confusing. It's a lot less confusing than american currency. Plus, mBTC is just what my wallet happened to go by, as most people don't have whole bitcoins.

These units are not only for bitcoin, though, and we use them so that currency, and everything else, makes MORE sense. Imagine if everything was defined just by one unit, the bitcoin. Then people could have .000003 bitcoin or 2000 bitcoin. Or .00003 dollars or 50344 dollars. **The world doesn't work like that; we have multiple units so that everything makes more sense.**

These units aren't only for bitcoin, though, they are universally understood. You shouldn't have a problem with them.

Hmm. I live in america, and even though we use standard, I am able to understand metric just fine. It is simply powers of ten. I don't know why we don't use it for everything. Just add or subtract a zero. 
Plus, if you forget the prefix (milli, hecta, deca, whatever), you can look it up easily. 
I do not think that it is an inconvenience at all, in fact, I think it is even more convinient.

Well, maybe not instantly, but because SI is standardized, I can convert them fairly quickly. With a foreign currency (rupees, for example), I have no clue what any of them are. With the metric system, conversions are easy, and what you said at first, "Can you not use mBTC", doesn't make a lot of sense.

I was just seeing how it worked, and it was all the bitcoin I had at the time. I love giving to charity, but $2 was all I could spend.

Wow, that is really funny. Genuine laughter was had. Have 50 cents private.

Honestly, last time I used bits, someone gave me the exact opposite argument. Really, some might say 2 quarters, half a dollar, or 50 cents, but you still know what it means. Same here,it may just take 5 seconds to tell what it means, but everyone uses their own units.

Thanks man, I appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:40:51
That is cool man! Hope you get some more so you can spend 'em! You should actually buy some right now if you got the money, so you can take advantage of the low prices. Congrats!
