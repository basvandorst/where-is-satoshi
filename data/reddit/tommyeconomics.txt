Haha if only he thought it through that much, I'm pretty sure this isn't the case though, and fairly certain he functions like this on a normal basis.

I have learned in life that communication is key if you don't have communication you don't have a (healthy) relationship ( as I get the vibe that your friend is unwilling to discuss the points)

What about $1 fee? You cool with that too? Because that's right around the corner.

I made a video on the block size issue nearly a year ago, predicted that it would not be resolved easily and would lead to diversification into other cryptocurrencies like we're seeing now. See video here if interested:

Its programmable. Therefore all the programming you see on the web, etc, it can do.

Thanks for maintaining it, I'll see you around there!

How is CME getting wrecked?
@_date: 2019-03-22 08:38:04
Bitcoins market cap was around $50-100k, so investing a million dollars would push up the price considerably. They would probably be able to have gotten 10-20% of its supply at the time (about 1-2M coins released), maybe a few hundred thousand BTC (or close to $1B now). 
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:16:36
Sure, if you can get the majority of miners to agree
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:32:57
I used shapeshift where I have no control over the fee, and I've been waiting 7 hours. What about that? Don't use shapeshift? Lol.

FYI, Satoshi was around to orchestrate a fork or 2 in the first few years of Bitcoin's existence.
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:39:58
What isn't happening?
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:15:54
Really, in what capacity did I demonstrate a "lack of economics"? You can't even seem to recognize a trend in a chart.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:46:36
I just skimmed through that, didn't see anything new there, can you tell me where the decentralized lightning network transactions will be stored? Apparently you guys are saying it's not centralized, thus to be decentralized the ledger of transactions  will have to be spread across nodes and stored and secured much the same way Bitcoin is no? (Much like a blockchain) Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:30:19
I stand corrected, for all intents and purposes I never had to download more data than 15GB by default. So what is the problem then exactly? Seems like the network is and has been running just fine.
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:52:06
I never saw that, so is BIT shutting down then?
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:33:04
I disagree with those semantics, but I know what you're trying to say, lol. The answer you were seeking is actually not 75%, but 100% of all Ether was released, at its release (you asked how much of Ether (existing at the time) was released at its creation, lol).
@_date: 2017-01-10 04:35:17
For the record, from a third party, I thought your message was very reasonable and didn't sense anything wrong with it, it was kindly worded and all, no sweat
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:38:11
Lol no, 100 million Ether has not been mined since then. And no the value has not gone down, I bought my ICO Ether at around 50 cents each or so, it's over $10 right now, that's a 20x gain, lol.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:44:38
Ok, well it wasn't even Ethereum who created the concept and theyre not the only ones implementing it, and further, Ethereum's chain is currently only around 15GB or so, after a year of heavy use. I think they're doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:02:05
No they're not, go read up on sharding and master chain/child chains
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:58:38
Its 15GB is the full blockchain, compared to the 100GB Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:27:12
Yet every day a greater proportion of the cryptocurrency community is moving to other "altcoins," go look at the bitcoin dominance charts if you haven't, Bitcoin was already losing 3-4% dominance per year. You really feel comfortable accelerating that?
You didnt respond to my last comment either, I used shapeshift and waited 7 hours before using the viabtc accelerator, I couldnt control the fee, so what then, I can't use shapeshift??
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:40:16
Well I didn't shift all of it, but I did shift some... I wish I shifted more... lol
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:27:45
Etheruem was not pre-mined, it was an ICO. I'm pretty sure I know what you're saying, why don't you make your point, so I can show you how to read a graph in the future.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:40:40
Oh it's going to be decentralized then? You mean with its own block chain?
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:44:56
Well thank you for your consideration, but I've already thought quite a bit about what proportion I should keep in Ether for the last 2+ years ;)
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:04:26
Yeah except the whole problem about lightning network being centralized and the problems that come with that (hello regulation!)
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:27:00
Bitcoin sellers won't accept those large bills either I imagine, basically I expect there to be a black market for those big bills at about 70% of their value.
But yeah a lesson is those people should have moved their $$$ to Bitcoin in the past months or years.
Edit: And perhaps people will start heeding that lesson now, so if the government does a another ban in the future they aren't caught again with their pants down. I am certain there will be an increased demand for gold/Bitcoin/other unrecorded assets now in India.
@_date: 2017-01-25 01:42:19
No, you're incorrect. When I got involved in Bitcoin it's dominance was over 99%, now we're down to 85% and clearly its trending down 
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:27:08
So far we are at 6.33 BTC and growing ;)
@_date: 2016-11-23 15:33:17
In a year you'll be saying that about $750 Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-15 20:45:10
How is that small blocks ensure decentralized nodes? Mining as it is with the current 1mb block limit is very much centralized. It is centralized because it requires ASICs to mine bitcoin and thus your every day user isn't going to be running a node to mine Bitcoin.
Thus we are already centralized.

Of course! I didn't get confirmation from the dogetipbot so I'm sending it again :)

that was powerful, thank you
@_date: 2016-12-08 07:50:34
Good call
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:37:37
Because if they had bought Bitcoin with their big denominations, they could have easily now exchanged that Bitcoin for these smaller denominations that weren't banned. Because they held on to big bills, now they have to sell the big bills on a black market at an estimated 70% value (or they have to pay taxes on that money with a 200% penalty, which I dont think many want to do).
@_date: 2016-12-22 23:33:17
You are doing God's work
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:28:18
That graph looks pretty normal to me, do you notice the general upwards trend of that graph?
@_date: 2016-11-15 13:41:13
Do you pay attention to trends? in 2013 Bitcoin had, 99.5%+ of market share.
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:41:12
In 2007 it didn't exist. Every since it was created it has been trending down, see  under "Bitcoin Percentage of Total Market Capitalization"
It's currently at 84%, do you think it's not going to keep going down to 75%, then 65% of market share and so on? Because that's the trend that's been going on for 4 years now.
@_date: 2016-12-11 22:46:01
I disagree, we shouldn't disuade new users from experimenting with Bitcoin first. I think the first step is start playing around with small sums, then when you get the hang of it, IF you want to make a big investment, THEN learn security and backups before doing so.

This was powerful, if I had $10 in my account here you would receiving that now, none the less.. here's everything I have here on reddit right now
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:26:44
You don't need to remember 12 words, create a password you would remember, commit it to memory, and for a backup plan write down that password in a lot of places too, put around in various hidden places(like a shoebox), make lots of backups of the wallet.dat and put around in various hidden places too.
Now if you forget your password you know where to find it. And if you lose your wallet.dat you have it backed up in multiple places too.
Also, your wallet password should be something you never use for anything else. And you should never type it in on your daily computer (buy a new $200 laptop and create the wallet there, ideally all done offline).
@_date: 2016-11-15 20:36:26
Lol, "arbitrary lines"? The lines represent something cowboy. 
Edit: It's also already more than a 10% share, it has already hit 20% share, and soon will hit 30% and 40% on so on, get it? Probably not, wait a couple years and see, go ahead and put a !remind me 3 years from now, maybe you'll see by then.

Uhhhh and how is that?
@_date: 2016-09-13 08:49:33
Came here to say this. Something like this is an attractive investment opportunity- but you better bet Uber has long been thinking about this already and largely working on implementing this (self driving cars with algorithms that guide it around where to go to find passengers).
Furthermore, the car is not self-aware to own itself (and avoid deceit of people trying to claim ownership over it).
