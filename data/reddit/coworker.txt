I can quote wikipedia too.








[asset classes](
Seriously, you wouldn't consider $10k in the bank an asset?  Come on man.

Currency is an asset class.  It's often called "cash" if not forex or crypto.

Treating your BTC as gambling winnings is probably the best mindset to have though.

That's only true for equities that go up over time.  Nothing says Bitcoin will follow the trend of US stocks.

Currencies have no intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:44:56
lol intrinsic value &lt;&gt; market value.  That's investing 101

Don't listen to that guy.  Many of us bought at previous ATHs and wrote off the money only to be pleasantly surprised.  You just never know with crypto.

The market is irrational.  Assume your money is 100% lost and be happy if it ever goes back up.  I did this when I bought at $560 and it subsequently dropped to $200 for 2 years for no reason.

That's not an investment.  That's gambling.

DCA has been shown to be ineffective **for the US stock market**.  Time in the market is better because the stock market has always gone up over the long-term.  It's effectiveness for cryptocurrency is unknown because there's simply not enough history.
Also neither of you has touched on the main difference with DCA vs lump sum: DCA assumes a lower cost basis since the lower buys should bring down the higher buys.

No, they want to make sure that a collective of miners can't manipulate price without any kind of oversight possible.  It's still possible for Bitcoin to fork for random reasons (see ethereum) and completely wipe out the value of this and other ETFs with absolutely no recourse to anyone.

Lol sound due diligence here

[You don't have to report losses on stock sales so why would this be any different for Bitcoin](

Correction: you are storing encrypted versions of your passwords on a 3rd party host. None of your passwords, including your master password, ever get sent to LastPass in plain text.  Even with that breach, hackers should not have been able to decrypt anything since they couldn't obtain master passwords.

It's because they're not investors.

I know in my state it wouldn't matter if she knows the value.  Since he bought it pre-marriage and has kept it completely separate from marital funds, it would not be considered a marital asset. I would tell her but continue to keep it separate.

Says the guy who is surprised a competitor decided to implement an idea better than they did.
You might want to Google "stealth mode" smart guy.

This post is the epitome of millenial thinking.  OP has a legitimate bad turn of events but instead of learning from the experience, he whines about it on the internet and resorts to personal insults when people aren't supportive.
Despite what your parents may have told you, not everyone is a winner.

Would you blame someone for gambling away that $600 cause that's exactly what they did.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:07:48
He sold in Dec 2017 and bought in Jan 2018 so it's not bs at all.  He can deduct the losses but only $3k per year for the next 20 years.
