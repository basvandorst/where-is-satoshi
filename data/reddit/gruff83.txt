A web based notepad accessed by entering a passphrase.

That doesn't really solve the problem though does it.  It's not really practical to have a currency that can be lost and never re-minted or recovered.
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:57:39
Sure that's a problem that needs to be resolved by a process to ensure people's funds are not taken, but I don't think that's a good reason to just sit back and do nothing at all.  I'm also not talking about recovery of coins for individuals that have lost their coins, but for coins that have been lost over the course of many decade or centuries.  The solution might be as simple as moving your balance to a new wallet, with any balances not moved for 100 or 200 years to be released back into the blockchain for miners to mine/remint.

I think there needs to be a mechanism to recover lost coins if bitcoin were to ever become mainstream currency, otherwise there would be a possibility that all coins could be lost..... Then what?

Those numbers regarding blockchain size are tiny; there are big data solutions out there that run into the petabytes.  Of course your regular Joe Blogs couldn't run their own full node and expect to hold petabytes of data, but I guess that's where a decentralised distributed database would need to come into play - something similar to what Hadoop does, although this is not exactly decentralised.

I don't quite understand those modules, you can get them for computers as well when using something like bit locker; surely if someone stole the whole phone or computer, they have the tpm (private key) as well?
@_date: 2016-11-06 08:01:02
Correct; my point about Hadoop was that it does the distributed database peice, which from a scaling perspective, the blockchain would probably benefit from such technology.

Circle are decent, definitely worth finding out why you got declined.

What stops someone from spamming the bitcoin network by sending a single satoshi with no fee? Would these transactions not just sit around unconfirmed in the network and clog it up?  Would this even have an impact of the network?

Could have been a women!

I could be completely wrong here, but I read something on the Trezor website about transistors being blown in the device so you couldn't change the bootloader.  If you wanted to replace the transistor you need to open the device, which can't be done without breaking it, as they use some kind of ultrasonic mechanism to seal the unit.  All this info is on the Trezor website.

It's things like this that really need to be ironed out for bitcoin to really go mainstream; it's just too easy to lose BTC like this and requires a high level of technical understanding to recover from it.

Just tried this; I like it.  I wonder what happens if you lose your Trezor though, can the passwords still be accessed with just a seed or would you need to order a new Trezor to use the password manager?
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:34:10
I think I had the same problem myself when using electrum; I just sent the same payment to the same address but with a higher fee; I'm not really sure what stops the original transaction from potentially going through though and end up sending double - maybe someone more intelligent can answer that question
@_date: 2016-10-08 12:37:14
I hope someone is asking the same question about us in 10 years time.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:52:16
Have you tried to respend those coins through multibit? That's essentially what I was getting at.
@_date: 2016-10-20 16:20:23
Why does this help the network?  I currently use electric with a Trezor.
@_date: 2016-10-12 12:04:38
I suspect he must have an automated tool that's running a frequent check and checking for a specific response.
@_date: 2016-10-20 16:22:18
Thanks for the reply.  So is there any point in running a full node?  Does it benefit the network?  How do transactions actually find my node?
@_date: 2016-10-20 16:44:15
Thanks this is exactly the kind of info I was looking for.
@_date: 2016-10-20 08:24:23
So if I understand correctly, you can run a full node without mining, which is essentially what you see as a 'confirmation' when you send BTC, but it's the miners that actually commit the transaction to the block chain.  Is that correct?

You really should post your question in personal finance. I think placing all of your eggs in one basket is a bad idea; contrary to what people post here, investing in BTC is high risk and you shouldn't invest what you can't afford to lose. Generally the closer to retirement you are the less risk you want; the younger you are affords you more risk, as you have more time to recover from any mistakes.  I live in the UK and the first thing I do with my money is place it I into my company pension which my employer matches, I think your equivalent to this is a 401k; you should max that out before investing; any left over cash you can afford to lose you can invest with, and  diversify your portfolio.  I don't have much experience in trading, but I can tell you the first time I did it, I put a similar sum into a single stock and lost £4,000, as I needed to pull the money out for a house purchase; consider this if you might need to pull your BTC out.  My personal situation now is, I max out my pension, I have invested in 2 crypto currencies, and I'm currently looking to invest the remainder of my money into 2 blue chip companies.  Sure I might not make as much if BTC sky rockets, but at least I'm spreading my risk.
