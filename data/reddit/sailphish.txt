Your debt interest is known and fixed. Investment interest is not. Just because you made a certain return last year, doesn't guarantee the same. BTC may go to zero tomorrow. I am not saying he should sell, but there is a lot of advice on here that rely on one owning a crystal ball.

Why don't you see your 401k growing? I have seen double digit returns every year for the past few years. 
I find BTC interesting, and think there is potential. I am invested in it, but also consider it risky. I think people should be diversified. My 401k is mostly safer index funds. It is for me to fall back on. Outside of that I invest in riskier (but possibly higher reward) things, but accept losses can happen.

Nope. Still legal. Very large companies often work out deals with the government for lower tax rates on the basis that what they are contributing to the economy (jobs, GDP...) is much greater. Not saying it is right, but it is legal. It's different than you personally only doing business in BTC and then not reporting your earnings at tax time.

More people who actually understand investment strategy needed. This sub is filled with people who made a lucky gamble 1 year ago and now think they are investing gods who can do no wrong.

Please take a look at other investing forums, particularly not ones devoted to BTC. Information here is very biased. I am not saying don't invest in BTC, but you need to know what you are getting into.
Why do you want to invest in BTC? Do you believe in the technology and see it revolutionizing the world's currency? Do you just see BTC getting a lot of press recently?
Investments are risky, some more than others. Also, past performance is not a guarantee on future performance. Sure you might make millions in BTC, or you might loose everything. In my opinion, there are a lot of safer investments out there, but potential rewards aren't as high. What is your risk tolerance? Do you want something that will more than likely give a few percentage points a year, or do you want something that might give enormous returns but can also go bust?
Lastly, what are your current finances like? How bad do you need this 50k? If you invest it and loose it, does it significantly impact your life? Do you have other debts that need to be paid? Could you use this money for something like college or a down payment on a house?
Nobody could tell you what the right move is for your situation, but I would encourage you to explore all the potential investment opportunities available to you before going all in on one specific investment. Lastly, be careful trusting anyone who gives you a definitive answer to that question without knowing anything about your personal situation.

High markups are not necessarily price gouging.

These discussions don't help your cause. They are ignorant. At best, you are comparing apples to oranges. Apple didn't do anything illegal. They are avoiding taxes as allowed by the current law. If you don't agree with the laws, then fight to have them changed.
Cryptocurrency is targeted as a way to evade taxes. It allows people to move large amounts of money anonymously. You have to pay capital gains taxes on profits made trading stock, commodities, and currency. Cryptocurrency is no different, but many people try get around this. 
TLDR - Avoidance does not equal evasion.

What is was supposed to be is irrelevant. All that matters is what it became. It just isn't convenient to use as currency. Transactions take too long. Fees too high. The best comparison would be gold, which also trades like a commodity although has some currency elements to it.

More likely they just are trying to avoid paying taxes. BTW, Square will give you a free credit card reader and charge 2.75% which is pretty much on par with normal credit card fees.

Clearly not following his own advice.

There is also a whole generation who has never weathered a true market crash and doesn't know what it feels like watching their portfolio lose 75% of its value overnight.
