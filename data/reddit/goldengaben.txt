I actually got in pretty late. Around 3k. But I've made other investments and I've been lucky with day trading i guess :)
I'm just trying to get to my first bitcoin in the next year

Yeahh, thanks a lot for the advice! I'm 16 years old, so I still have quite a bit to learn. I'm majoring in Economics, so I'm trying to incorporate Bitcoin into my learning as much as possible :)

Yeahh, i plan on doing it. But right now, i only have $1450. I started out with $20. I do a lot of other stuff as well to raise some more money. There's a game called CS:GO with its own in game economy, and profiting off there is much easier than bitcoin with less money. So thats why i occasionally take some money off bitcoin to invest in this game's economy and put it back into Bitcoin. But hopefully when i get close to $5k or $10k, I'll probably HODL long term. But right now, it just isn't as profitable as other things

Sorry, I couldn't help myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:27:57
Not at all. I don't day trade or do anything like that. I'm just happy i managed to buy out before it dips because i plan on rebuying. I don't do it often though.

Same, 1.2 right here. I'm trying to get some investments from my parents so i can put close to $10,000. But i made this ~$1400 from a $20 investment, so can't really complain much :)

@_date: 2017-04-21 20:04:04
It says its 20 sat/B. Im guessing thats not ok. How can i change it?? 
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:15:33
