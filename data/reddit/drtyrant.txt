No shit Einstein, I'm asking why! What value does it have? Why would someone care about a shit drawn frog?

Insightful, as always

Logical leap much? Jesus! I'm asking about this particular meme not them all you nimrod. One can find something unfunny while still understanding the joke. You may not find a joke about Ethiopians not getting lunch funny but still understand what the premise of the joke is. What is the deal with pepe is all i'm fucking wondering about. Is it, "oh he looks so pathetic, I can relate" or, "he looks so retarded, I'll use him to represent ppl I don't like"? All I'm asking is what most people see as the premise of the pepe meme (as stated already, I'm curious about the meaning that is unrelated to alt-right shit, i get the triggering madlads, don't get fondness for fugly frog).
EDIT: Also, why is it being used in r/bitcoin?? That was my initial question. I didn't think it was for political reasons so I became curious as to what other reasons might be.

Why the pepe?

I don't care what color you are; I just don't see why people use it. If it's an alt-right thing I get it, you're an idiot, but if not why use it? What does it add?

So thats a strong argument for those who used the meme before the association. It may have started in 4chan like those others you mentioned but it's certainly associated with certain extremism presently. Seems unlikely that new users are completely unaware/not intending that context when they post it (my opinion).

Wow thank you! I was really thinking like okay, no one wants to discuss shit, must be an alt-right thing. I appreciate the perfectly logical alternative

Been around for a bit bud. I've seen it used in non extremist contexts and still not gotten it. My understanding at this point is that it can be like a "this is funny in random context" way and greentexts memes. IDK if that's the case but what's funny is I asked and y'all come out saying it's super obvious and dissing all the while never just saying what it is

Agreed. Hasty judgments should be avoided. Especially when information is lacking

It's undeniably a hate symbol used by the alt-right. It's all over their subreddits. I'm not questioning why they do it (trigger the libs and shit). I'm really wondering if there are people who unironically use it without it's alt-right intent. It's so unfunny I feel like it would have zero appeal to anyone were it not for the racism.
