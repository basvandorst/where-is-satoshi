@_date: 2019-06-29 00:21:21
Correct but I'm not sure If they take bitcoin If not Is there any service I can use as medium to send them wire transfer?
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:26:20
Bittrex Is regulated by the law as well that's why I didn't mind leaving that much on their platform.

@_date: 2017-11-09 21:37:46
Thanks a lot mate! and much appreciated! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:16:03
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:17:33
I understand! Thanks a lot but In this case If they don't have an actual office he can send the individuals a letter even though the company Is a limited liability ?
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:27:09
Thanks a lot mate!

@_date: 2017-11-10 10:35:28
Check thread again.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:27:38
Well yes I was Poloniex blocked me before.
and I have OCD I keep them In round number that doesn't mean I'm a scammer and I'm not a liar! :) 
1# Keep an eye for this thread to prove you that I keep my word even that It sounds to you too good to be true.
2# This is the proof for the round numbers and If you need more proof you're most welcome.
Time 12:25 PM (GMT+2)
3# Yes, everyone has savings In bitcoins and altcoins and yes all my bitcoins In blockchain.info
4# No valid point here.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:34:24
It's not resolved yet.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:23:51
What do u mean ?
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:31:40
Thanks a lot for reaching out !!!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:22:35
I speculate on altcoins , having this amount In bitcoin won't get me the same profits I'm after.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:27:06
If you read the commenter you'll see It's all none-sense there's no proof that I'm fake.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:29:32
They requested documents, I sent them..
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:55:46
I'm trying all the possible ways..
Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:53:58
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:30:38
I believe In you guys, 
I believe In bitcoin
Thanks a lot for reaching out!
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:23:37
Thanks guys for the replies, A quick question after the fork storm Is over I can Import private key back Into Blockchain.info Wallet to retrieve B2X or minority chain coins?
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:58:16
Thanks a lot for reaching out, I'm not in the states
You can fill a claim If you're In a specific state?
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:07:54
And yes I agree with you also I'd suggest you open an account on some legit FX brokers most of them now have BTC/USD It's easier and they have better tools and trading platforms like MT4
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:09:24
I know but It's been more than a month I'll keep you guys updated and thanks a lot for reaching out! &lt;3
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:26:50
I haven't tweeted yet, If you tweet this thread will be more than enough!
Thanks a lot
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:33:25
This is not an FUD..
I updated the thread.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:45:50
Would appreciate It! As I promised I'll reward everyone who help me get exposure on my case. 
10% of my coins will be given back to the community once the case resolved.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:42:17
I need an invite.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:50:05
Thanks a lot man, much appreciated !! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:42:14
That's what I'm trying to do.
Thanks a lot
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:29:19
Correct, Lebanon
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:43:05
I'm in the process, Thanks a lot mate!

@_date: 2017-11-11 13:34:07
Asked for help
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:28:19
I'll burn 10% for you to buy cookies and milk! &lt;3
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:51:46
I didn't have any issue for the past 12 month's here until they decided to disable my account, However It's regulations so each case Is different
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:58:24
That doesn't help 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:00:26
Thanks a lot mate I appreciated
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:50:29
I'm not asking anyone to feel sorry, Yes I accept the risk losing money If I buy a scamcoin or something but I'll never accept a regulated exchanger In the US to freeze my money for no reason.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:29:34
It will be a pain doing It manually but It's worth it! :D
Any idea of how to make an automation to send % to certain addresses?
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:37:35
Already provided them with all the documents they requested.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:15:22
Yes high risk, high reward.. 
That's how I made it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:33:50
Yep I do. 
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:08:58
Thanks man! appreciate the support.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:58:46
Yes I'll keep my word and hope they enable your account as soon as possible as well
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:01:28
Your linkedin ?
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:38:40
Hahahaha, Fixed! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:39
I said clearly In the thread I'll update once my problem Is resolved.. I have nothing against them except that they're holding my money..
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:31:16
Thanks In the process, Any recommendations?
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:14:17
It will be given once the account Is enabled.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:29:37
I never heard of Open Dime but I wouldn't trust It.
I'd go with Ledger
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:05:51
If you’re asking this on /r/ then you’re not ready..
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:55:24
Yes I agree! Without market makers Bitcoin has no value. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:31:01
Not really It’s more than 200K now I’ll post screenshot soon
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:06:05
Thanks , It is
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:45:43
Correct, Thanks a lot mate.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:29:05
No, Poloniex blocked me before and I managed to take my money out before they did.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:12:45
I'll update about the reward share In the thread keep It up.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:04:18
Still I can't find a proper reason why would anyone fake a story like mine, I'm not asking anything except support back from the community.. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:08:34
Thanks a lot, I'll keep you posted till then please stay safe and put your coins somewhere else until It's clear what's going on.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:57:25
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:41:40
I'm In the process, Thanks a lot
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:03:30
Thanks man I’ll keep you guys updated
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:35:53
My assets are In altcoins not In bitcoin but I appreciate the support 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:27:29
I'm a day trader that's what I do this Is why I leave money on them
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:43:38
Thanks a lot mate!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:13:20
Thanks a lot! I appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:44:35
Well that's what driving me crazy Is that they didn't say what's the problem with my account.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:10:13
Absolutely! Thanks man you're right. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:59:50
If you can share my case with them I'd really appreciate It.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:02:01
I'll keep this thread updated!
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:30:32
Please! Thanks a lot however In the end as I promise I'll share 10% of all my altfolio for the community as a thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:27:42
Thanks a lot for reaching out !! I appreciate it really.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:01:45
A share or tweet to this would be more than enough!
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:09:27
I'm looking as well If there's any good p2p platforms
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:15:01
Hope you get It back even If It's not much but still It's yours.
Well post your ticket number here.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:35:42
I'm here and I'm keeping my word regarding the reward.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:37:16
Thanks a lot man that's more than enough , I really appreciate It.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:51:20
Thanks a lot mate I really appreciated I've already sent out numerous of messages to them with no response 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:33:13
Thanks a lot man !!! That's more than enough 
Appreciate the support and as I promised everyone I'll keep my word
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:52:46
I updated the thread for those who doubt and think I'm fake :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:30:01
Updated thread.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:00:34
I don't understand.. :( 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:29:41
They blocked me on Slack! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:49:43
Yes , no answer was given.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:46:37
Super! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:49:38
Thank you! You can double your coins with Alties even some of them lack of strong roadmap etc.. It's a speculative instrument
to me It's like penny stocks open to the world and not limited only to the US.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:01:17
Did they disable you before?
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:24:11
Thanks a lot for reaching out I'll keep this thread updated and I appreciate your support
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:52:19
Who ?
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:29:36
Read again the thread :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:13:17
A scam when I take $ from you or anyone else, If you don't believe my story you can pass I'm not asking anything from anyone expect their support to my case
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:06:33
Thanks a lot , And congrats on buying your first bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:20:17
I'm overseas :( I didn't get your first question.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:42:59
Yes at least they should tell you before so you can take take out your assets..
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:19:34
I haven't think of a way and with all the support and the comments I'll give It back to 100-200 otherwise If we divide 15,000$ back to 1300 comment each one will have 12$ that's not really a reward so once It's enabled will update the thread on how to claim It.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:44:13
Thanks a lot , I appreciated !! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:30:29
At the end of the day you can keep them In round numbers however I'm updating the thread :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:28:01
Keep an eye for this thread and you'll see I keep my promise.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:04:44
Well yes I was Poloniex blocked me before. and I have OCD I keep them In round number that doesn't mean I'm a scammer and I'm not a liar! :)
1# Keep an eye for this thread to prove you that I keep my word even that It sounds to you too good to be true. 
2# This is the proof for the round numbers and If you need more proof you're most welcome. Time 12:25 PM (GMT+2)  
3# Yes, everyone has savings In bitcoins and altcoins and yes all my bitcoins In blockchain.info 
4# No valid point here.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:11:26
Yes! That will be great however I'll share the % to those who participate and show efforts otherwise the reward will be minimal to everyone.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:41:18
Thanks a lot! I appreciate It.
Please keep me updated.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:47:57
Better, I'll share 10% of my portfolio back to the community.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:50:33
I've done it already.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:07:36
Yes you're right I agree however Trezor or Ledger takes time to get some certain altcoins supported and you might lose a lot of profit In this case.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:36:14
Correct, Anyway blame Is a wrong word..
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:54:18
It's different to me all my coins there are Alt-coins which some of them available only on Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:30:10
Thank you !
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:03:32
S9’s being sold on eBay for 2,500-4,000
Where can you buy It for 1500?
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:46:21
It's not and I'm not sitting on 10M however I'm not playing any game, I updated thread for those who doubt me.
and I'll update thread once my account Is enabled so I can reward those who believed In me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:57:27
Hardware wallets are okay If you're In a long term but If you're trading It doesn't make sense 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:10:02
Thanks a lot !! I really appreciate It.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:14:21
You can create your wallets offline using an air gapped pc and when u want to make a transaction then take the wallet online make the transaction and remove the wallet, As far that's what I'm using correct me If there's a better way.
(I'm talking about bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:52:51
Yep all 2FA was turned on
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:20:00
I don't have to post any sensitive Information to prove a point as I said all those who doubts my credibility keep an eye on this thread I'll prove them wrong
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:52:32
Thanks a lot mate I appreciated !!
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:39:06
And I'll keep my promise, Thanks a lot for the support.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:53:26
Thanks a lot for your help but In exchangers It's different they control your private key.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:00:16
It's not resolved yet, once resolved don't worry I'd be more than happy to share.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:36:01
Yes and Unreal , I updated the thread again.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:34:20
I updated the thread again for those who thinks I'm fake.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:28:51
In the process, Thanks for recommendation 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:39:46
The design Is clean I like it,
Thanks will look into It.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:23:10
I do actually think some of those stories are correct however bought before June this year made massive profits.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:32:19
It's not , I updated the thread..
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:42:32
I'm hoping the same!
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:56:33
I'm not and yes I do believe traders will be under the IRS in coming month 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:21:06
I didn't read their policy..
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:41:57
They’re not letting me can you send an invite?
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:24:53
Thanks a lot ! I appreciated!
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:47:28
And about MtGox It's like your bank went on fire, You and everyone else burned then things happens and you move on. Just like LR/E-Gold/Etc.. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:40:41
Very good Idea, 
I thought of It and I didn't wanna look as If I'm buying RT's. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:46:57
Ofcourse I will, Thanks a lot for the support
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:24:20
I've done things differently and since they're regulated In the US I didn't expect this from them.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:23:56
Thanks a lot man! I appreciate It
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:44:28
Much appreciated! and once this Is resolved I'll keep my promise of giving back to the community.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:12:04

@_date: 2017-11-09 23:41:30
Thanks a lot for reaching out! I appreciate It
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:13:05
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:15:05
Thanks a lot bud, That's what I'm trying to do.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:17:18
There's nothing better. 
Money distribution at It's finest.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:16:26
I'm not.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:43:52
Then you're right. however risk Is minimal when you see other altcoin swings.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:30:58
Thanks ! already did with no luck
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:11:09
It is and I can't thank you enough I'll keep this thread updated when It's resolved as well keeping my promise of sharing 10% of my portfolio back to the community 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:04:27
Guys I'd appreciate a share to raise awareness, And I thank everyone who can help me get exposure on my case.
I'll reward all the supporters once my account Is re-enabled again.
Thank you all again.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:25:52
Well my account was Enhanced verified before they decided to disable It.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:45:31
Well I'm living overseas there's no reason for them to hold my funds. It's a service and we're dealing with Altcoins I'm not dealing with USD for them to freak out and put me under investigation. :/
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:44:25
Thanks I tried It didn’t work
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:27:41
I don't mind I'm giving up away 10% you can later decide where to send them I'll run a poll
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:24:36
Well usually AML/KYC companies doesn't let you open an account for example or deal with their service since they follow SEC guidelines, I understand..
but what I don't understand that they let you In and verify you then tell you wait you're not allowed we're taking your money. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:47:14
Thanks a lot all of you, The traction I've got so far means a lot to me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:16:24
It's not they said my account under review and they didn't say what kind of review and why I'm locked up
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:36:50
Thank you ! as for other points I have bitcoin's saving and I use bittrex for Alts.
I don't see what's wrong with that.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:44:14
US law applies everywhere this Is why Bitfinex/Bitwala Will stop accept US citizens 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:45:12
Yes and If you happen to send or buy something off the Internet and they flag It as suspicious they can wipe you out I've heard many stories about Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:19:06
Thanks a lot mate!
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:24:26
Thanks a lot for keeping up with my case and I’ll keep you posted as I promised!
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:14:24
What do u mean?
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:54:42
I've had some problems with Poloniex before, They let me take out all my money before closing my account.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:20:11
Well post your ticket here as well!
And hopefully It will get attraction as well..
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:12:05
Yep true but It doesn't have all the altcoins which I was betting on.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:59:48
Achievement Unlocked
And new therapist will be available to continue your session with her..
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:44:51
Thanks a lot much appreciated , Keep an eye on the thread I'll update how the 10% will be divided there.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:17:19
A bit less than that but I'll make sure everyone gets a reward after my case Is resolved! :D
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:49:36
No, I don't believe In foundations controlled by few people..
I'll donate the 10% to whoever helped me raising awareness In here..
I'm not sure yet If I'll do It manually or run a script If you have a way to do this In a fair way please let me know. 
(Notice: Decision Is made so even If I'll have to send It manually I'll do It)
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:58:42
That's exactly what I'm trying to do.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:23:01
Lol 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:30:45
They blocked me on Slack.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:59:21
I know as from now on I'll try to stay away from everything "Regulated"
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:46:43
I actively trade and those came from 50K$ Investment I've got streak of good coins over the past year.. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:06:25
It's been disabled since Oct 22
Anyway hopefully It's resolved as soon as possible
Thanks for your reply
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:58:11

Thanks a lot for your support!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:13:40
Thanks a lot mate I appreciated
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:00:19
It's more than enough! I appreciate the effort really.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:23:23
Thanks a lot ! I appreciated 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:47:17
None of that, I have 2FA and I didn't get any email notification.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:38:21
Because It can be applied worldwide.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:37:04
Thanks a lot mate, I appreciated it!!
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:31:19
Thanks a lot for reaching out !!! I really appreciate it I'll let you know how It's going !! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:07:36
As for market makers (exchangers) they're really useful when It comes to buying/liquidating your coins/tokens and I don't mind sending them my ID documents when I request USD out, However altcoins being regulated doesn't make sense to me since In the end we'll exchange them back to Bitcoin -&gt; USD  
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:40:52
I'm an early adopter well not early but I've catched It around 300$-400$
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:14:50
All my deposits were In bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:42:12
I agree with you however there's Trezor and other hardware wallets, but It's easy to trade In/out whenever there's news or upgrade In coins mainnets or platform so even with Trezor you'll need a market-maker and In this case It's Bittrex
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:14:00
The idea behind cryptocurrencies Is to bank the Unbanked ones..
As long as you're cashing out through banks then It's regulated I've had this debate In a blockchain conference before.. and I'm keeping my word on this one, Until we have crypto-nation countries It's massively regulated.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:15:55
That's not risky, If you want real risk trade altcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:18:11
They did and I uploaded It already..
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:11:39
Send me your telegram please.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:11:28
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:17:16
Thanks I might give away hardware wallets as well back to the community and save their lives .
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:47:51
I'm so happy that It did work out for you In the end, and yes I agree with you!
They should suspend deposits/withdrawals until your account Is ready
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:40:53
Keep an eye on the thread I'll update It once enabled as well how to redeem rewards. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:42:05
Yes It's sad to see regulations trying to get their hands on our $
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:33:07
Yes they probably do.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:15:47
And don't believe that gambling Is bad, It's not! the systems you're gambling on are bad and rigged.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:08:34
I trade on a daily basis.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:02:48
I'm not trying to slander Bittrex and I'm here to solve my case and I haven't done any fraudulent activities on Bittrex.
And I'll keep my word regarding the reward.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:34:01
Thanks I'm not an american however they're KYC/AML compliant so I believe they can report your gains to the IRS. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:29:52
It means a lot to me! I'll not..
Thanks a lot man.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:45:39

Much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:18:15
I trade on a daily basis and I hold some altcoins there. (It's same answer why every one leaves $ on Bittrex)
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:35:07
Yes so ?
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:48:28
Yes .
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:53:13

@_date: 2017-11-09 23:21:10

I'm glad you got It fixed In the end I'll keep this thread updated.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:42:53
I'm not involved In any pump/dump scheme however If you check the last month events when they changed their mind about de-listing one of the altcoins that's one of the biggest pump/dump method.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:09:51
I haven't made any tweet yet, I'll do now..
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:17:33
Thanks a lot, Will keep this thread updated.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:35:29

@_date: 2017-11-10 10:29:55
Thank you !!!
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:16:36
Those doesn't mean anything but thanks a lot for reaching out.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:23:06
The only thing to blame here Is the bullish year for Alts.. And Bittrex 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:58:22
Once resolved I'll divide the reward In a fair way. I haven't think of a way yet but the decision Is made.
If you have any idea let me know I might even do It manually.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:22:05
I'm not sure about that yet.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:43:05
Nothing, Heavily trading.. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:45:08
like what?
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:32:17
Thank you that's more than enough ! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:46:59
Make sense.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:46:27
Well If you tell Warren Buffet, We froze your 100k and you have access to them anymore, It will hurt and It's not about the money It's a mind set someone to steal from you even If It's 1$ or 150k$
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:38:44
Exactly! 
If I did something wrong prove It,
If not re-enable my account!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:44:08
Thanks a lot for helping me out! I appreciate It and I said I'll keep my promise.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:36:55
Thanks man , hopefully you managed to get your coins back
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:35:34
Thanks a lot mate! I appreciated.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:20:08
I totally agree with you, even with all the security..
A customer support can play around and take your $
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:13:33
Thanks a lot , That's what I'm betting on !
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:12:34
So what’s the liquidity on Bisq?
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:14:08
Tl:dr Please :D 
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:42:52
Yep don't panic - french montana
@_date: 2017-07-14 01:41:27
Won't happen :(
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:49:54
I agree.. compared to other Altcoins they crippled 
@_date: 2017-07-14 01:42:24
I meant Segwit2x :( Sorry for letting you do all the research 
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:53:01
I don't believe so, It went from 12 to 2$ on the split but It gained It back quickly.. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:35:30
I mean If you look at the scenario of Etherium both chains continued to grow..
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:39:58
Thought of that but Litecoin (And all Altcoins) are known of following Bitcoin's swings, however not sure In this case If It will go In different direction
@_date: 2017-07-14 01:43:43
Sorry I didn't wear my suit today, I should talk more formal next time, Enjoy your day our operators will be there to assist you
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:47:21
If you had Etherium at that time you would gain on both..
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:59:31
Well mark my word, A huge dip on will happen on late july, Nothing will happen on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:13:45
Sell them to Alties I mean
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:38:42
Seems It's affecting your mood as well, You need to chill 
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:57:43
I can help shoot me a pm.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:39:34
They started already with UASF ?
I think I'm sure It's the Bill :( 
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:16:30
Because you need to know exactly what's the problem he's facing then will research a bit (And don't worry I'm not a scammer)
