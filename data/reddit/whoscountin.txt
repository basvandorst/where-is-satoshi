He provided a service to society in the face of an unjust legal system. It's very easy to be sympathetic towards someone who made that kind of sacrifice. Someone's gotta stand up for what's right.
@_date: 2015-05-27 02:13:38
I didn't say it was legal, I said it was right. Sure, some drugs are incredibly destructive and realistically very little good can come of them - heroin and meth come to mind. However, things like psychedelics are unparalleled and extremely valuable spiritual and psychological tools that can do a lot of good. I personally think it's a crime that so many people do not have access to safe and consistent psychedelics, as it's a unique experience that really can't be replicated by anything else. Psychedelics saved me from years and years of deep depression, suicidal ideation, and generally feeling like life wasn't worth living. Shrooms have given me a sense of spirituality that has enriched my life greatly, and acid every month or two cures my depression that was resistant to therapy, medication, etc. Hell, I don't even take anti-depressants anymore and my life is so much better than a few years back. So yes, providing a spiritual and psychological tool that is largely unavailable and often of dubious quality (or not even what a shady dealer is claiming to sell) is a good thing. It is very illegal. But it is a positive contribution to society.

Why does it matter if they are orders of magnitude different? It's the same idea: in both the walking through a bad neighborhood scenario and using Silk Road, you understand that something bad could happen to you for making said choice. Actually, I'll make it even more analogous: walking down a dark alley as a shortcut. Now you're going about it in a stupid way, like someone not properly protecting their identity on SR. You should still have the right to protect yourself from harm. I know self-defense laws are ridiculous in a lot of places (eg. if someone tries to rob you with a knife, stabbing them would be illegal because you have an obligation to run first). But again I'm arguing ethics not laws
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:04:01


  
That's true. However, I would liken it to walking alone at night in a bad part of town. You're obviously assuming a risk, and unless you're incredibly naive you know what you're doing. You should still be allowed to protect yourself from muggers, and if someone sees you being mugged, they should be allowed to fight the mugger off and help you as well. If I was using bad judgement and walking through a bad part of town and some guy came up to me with a gun and said he was going to kill me or imprison me for the rest of my life, I think I should be allowed to shoot him. And I think a good Samaritan should be allowed to shoot him as well.  
  
Just because you're doing something that has some inherent risk doesn't mean that you don't have a right to protect yourself against that risk. You should have every right to defend yourself against aggression in a proportional manner. IMO, death is a proportional response to someone trying to make you dead. Do you disagree that you should be allowed to kill someone who is coming at you with the intent and means to kill you?  
  
I can see arguing that the blackmailer wasn't threatening death, so death was not an appropriate response. And that is an understandable stance. However, the legal repercussions for shipping drugs around the country would destroy your future and probably land you in jail forever. Ruining a life is just as bad as ending one (if not worse because the victim has to experience the pain of a destroyed existence rather than just not existing at all)

Oh, yeah I misunderstood when you said hand everything over to law enforcement - wasn't trying to be purposefully dense. Long week.  
  
Anyway, you raise an interesting point, but that seems like it would almost guarantee a bad outcome. Since you said that was a scenario where the blackmailer was threatening to *kill* customers, we're kind of getting away from the scenario we were originally discussing. But in any case, I have two main problems with going to law enforcement as a response:  
  
1. I don't think that putting this person (who knows lots of info that can ruin so many people) into the hands of Law Enforcement would actually end up any different than if the blackmailer decided to release all the info on their own. Even if murder, and not blackmail, was their original goal, once they're in cuffs why not bargain with the cops and leverage all of that info? They're clearly an enemy of the community. You can't call in the cops to help without bringing the enemy to your gate, and practically you have pushed everyone much closer to being fucked over AND provided fucking law enforcement with a huge lead. This is a pretty bad solution from a practical sense.
2. The practical concerns play a part in this, but it also goes back to the social contract that comes with becoming a part of the criminal world and entering that kind of business. You don't call the cops. You don't. You don't drop a tip about a rival drug lord to have them arrested, because that would be destroying really the one real instance of honor among thieves. You don't call the devil to come help with your problems. And as soon as you do, not only are you a truly truly two-faced sack of shit, but you'll probably end up dead when *anyone* realizes you're a liability to the community who will run to law enforcement when you don't know what to do.  
  
If you're not part of the criminal world, it's totally different. You haven't become a part of the social contract. It's like I have no trouble with people going out and fucking whoever they want, unless they're in a committed relationship. You have to have some honor and your word needs to be worth something. As a criminal who goes to the cops, you have zero honor, you are a liability, and you are overall just a piece of shit who will use any means possible to get a leg up, even making a deal with the devil himself.
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:03:37
Handing everything over to LE is just as bad as what the blackmailer was threatening. That's like calling in an ogre to fight off someone who is threatening to unleash an ogre on your town. "The right thing to do" should not end up with thousands of productive people who provide a service being locked up and detained against their will until they die (not to mention having everything stolen from them). People do need to take responsibility for their actions. But going to jail for selling drugs isn't taking responsibility for your actions, it's being baselessly attacked and imprisoned by a hostile force that you have no hopes of combatting. Being killed because you broke the fundamental social contract of your trade and are willingly making your existence a threat to thousands of people's freedom... It's not quite taking responsibility for your actions, but it's certainly closer

Yeah, neither "criminals [or] anti-government agents" are a categorically bad thing. With the current state of laws, being a criminal is no indication of a person's morality (though it is probably an indication of free thinking), and being an anti-government agent is an actively ethical pursuit, so long as it's gone about in ethical ways (eg. not blowing up buildings or hurting people).
@_date: 2015-04-04 22:18:24


Nope, we haven't lost any, because our freedom was severely limited to begin with. The Silk Road being brought down and Ross being arrested are not a step away from freedom, just an illustration of how little freedom we have already. I'm only talking about the conviction so far, not the murders, because most of this actually seemed immoral. On the other hand, should Ross have been let off it would be a huge win for freedom, whether the reasoning was because of the obvious corruption *or* because the legal system magically realized it has no rights to babysit adults and tell them what they can buy, sell, and ingest with their own bodies.
@_date: 2015-04-03 06:54:54
The posts themselves aren't obvious trolling or even extremist views. It's the fact that they ONLY ever post whatever they can to skew pro-government, pro-law enforcement. That's what makes people say it's a shill account, and my point is any halfway decent "government agent" on reddit (which is a ridiculous notion) would at least try to make their activity look halfway normal.

@_date: 2015-04-01 14:34:28
Well put. Taking out an illicit business partner who has decided to turn on you (and a bunch of the site's vendors) as a cash grab is totally acceptable IMO. Not sure what his other option was supposed to be. Killing one aggressor is more than a fair response to said aggressor essentially holding a bunch of lives hostage. Because, let's be honest, any SR seller who was outed would most likely have the rest of their life ruined by law enforcement.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:41:21
Well if all the allegations are true, I definitely don't agree with all (or even most) of the hits put out. It's a disproportionate response to someone stealing a bunch of money from your black market website.  
  
In the case of Friendly Chemist though, it seemed fair. Should you have someone killed because they fuck up and lose a bunch of your money? No. Should you kill someone because they robbed you? No. But in a case where someone enters the criminal world and participates in that business and then threatens to expose thousands of names, I don't know what else you'd expect. I don't object to that hit for a few reasons:  
  
1. Friendly Chemist knowingly brought it on himself. For the sake of the argument let's pretend that it wasn't all a big lie/scheme. Like I said, friendly chemist voluntarily got involved in the black market, and then broke the universal and understood implicit contract that you do not rat other people in the business out. He clearly made a CHOICE to do something that would make any reasonable person expect lethal consequences. It wasn't a mistake or a misunderstanding and he was clearly making threats. He knowingly took on that risk in exchange for potential profit.  
2. However, I still don't think that line of logic alone is enough to justify a lethal response. Otherwise, I'd say it was justified to kill someone who just stole from the site, but I don't believe that. I wouldn't really feel that bad for the thief, but I also wouldn't defend DPR's decision. No, what really makes it an understandable move is the fact that this person was going to destroy thousands of other lives. Being sent to federal prison until you die doesn't sound much better than being taken out by a hit man. So the hit is really taking one scumbag's life as both a consequence for being evil and, more importantly, a protective measure to prevent thousands of innocent people's lives. Obviously I don't mean innocent in the legal sense, but innocent in the sense that they did nothing to warrant being killed. They just dealt drugs, which is providing a service. If we're talking from a purely legal standpoint, then yeah they're not innocent and putting out a hit is always wrong and there's no discussion to be had, but I'm looking only at consequences and actions and their real effects on people. In this argument, the law is really only a weapon wielded by the blackmailer.  
  
**TL;DR: Murder is wrong. I agree. If you kill someone or have someone killed, you're almost guaranteed not to be a good person. Killing is *almost* never justified. But I think it's fair to kill someone given: 1) killing them will save another life (or lives) from being ruined or ended... AND 2) the person is intentionally creating that threat of a ruined or ended life. It has to be intentional malice. As a punishment, murder is never just. As a preventative measure against a SERIOUS threat that comes from a place of malice or self-interest? Sure. I'm glad DPR was protecting the community. In that one case.**

You wouldn't look for spore kits, because spores are legal to possess, sell, ship, etc. Unless you live in a couple really shitty states.  
  
However, mycelium itself IS illegal because it contains small amounts of psilocybin. If you saw the word mycelium, you'd look for a liquid culture syringe/jar.  
  
Sure this is stupid and off topic, BUT people should know where the law draws the line. If even one person sells/orders spores and it results in even one more grow out there, this comment has made the world a better place.

Are you really a brain scientist? You're acting like all drugs have the effects and mechanism of action as methamphetamine.  
  
Please, tell me about the devastating effects of psilocybin on the brain and body, because unless you have underlying psychological issues or use it irresponsibly, you're not doing any damage.

@_date: 2015-02-05 16:17:15
If he had just ordered the one hit on FriendlyChemist then I completely agree that one death is worth 1000s of lives ruined, at least in this case, since the person in question was knowingly holding those lives ransom for a bunch of money.  
  
However, I know the hits extended beyond the person who was directly making the threats, and that's where it gets morally dicey.
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:34:51
There were FIVE hits ordered? Somehow I've only heard of the one - the guy who was threatening to expose users info.

No one said "blackmail is more deplorable than murder". That's a really broad and meaningless statement.

@_date: 2015-02-05 04:08:22
I know that there's no possible way this logic will ever be legally permissible or even generally accepted, but I think his attempted hit was warranted. The party/parties he was trying to get rid of were threatening to completely destroy people's lives if they didn't get, essentially, a ransom. I think it's wrong to hold people's lives hostage like that - they brought it upon themselves. Just like how if someone is holding a gun to another person's head and threatening to pull the trigger, they deserve to be shot.

You've clearly never used any psychedelics.  
  
Just to clarify, I am not a "junkie", and the last time I tripped was... more than half a year ago I believe. However, very occasional (or even just one-time) psychedelic use can add a lot to your perspective and give you an experience that is literally unparalleled and beyond normal comprehension.  
  
There are a lot of drugs (probably most of them) that *are* worthless and are used by weak people. Even psychedelics can easily be abused by weak people. However, your blanket statement definitely displays some ignorance.
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:27:05
I know this is just anecdotal evidence so it doesn't change anything you said - and I agree entirely (we shouldn't make scientific declarations without due diligence), but from a personal standpoint, the legal barriers to psychedelic research make my blood boil. I'm on anti-depressants (Wellbutrin) for the second time in my life. I was on them for 2 years, went off for a year, and have been back on for another year since then. They undoubtedly HELP make things better. It mitigates the depression to a degree but doesn't eliminate it or make me consistently happy, even when things are going great in my life.  
  
HOWEVER, a solid dose of LSD or psilocybin clears up my depression completely. *Completely.* I cannot stress this enough. It's like night and day, and being happy after being depressed for years (even with meds) was literally the best feeling I've **ever had**. I'm not talking about while tripping - sometimes it is a LOT of fun, but sometimes it's rough. It's the after-effects that are most important to me. The effect lasts anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months, and it's consistent. Even during the year when I WASN'T ON MY OFFICIAL MEDS, there was a 6 month period where I was tripping around once per month. I was the happiest I've ever been since childhood. Even after bad trips, it was like a flip was switched in my head. Even if I didn't want to trip, when I felt my depression coming back, I would ride out a trip for the therapeutic benefits. I compare it to running a cache cleaner on a computer. I would clear my head (which could be a rough process if it had been too long since my last trip), be content and happy with life (as well as more productive), and the worst part in retrospect is that I remember thinking "This is so easy and simple, being happy. There's no reason why I shouldn't always feel this way". Then after a few weeks or a month, something gradually changes and the crap builds up in my head until I'm back to my baseline depression. I haven't had access to psychedelics in over a year. I got back on my meds, which do help, but it's nothing compared to when I was taking psychedelics once per month.  
  
I have to take my current meds daily, which can't be any healthier than tripping semi-regularly. I have to pay much more for a daily med than for a monthly trip. And most importantly, my meds probably work half as well. They help. I feel *better*, but I miss that feeling of relief and happiness that came from my psychedelic use. The time frame lines up with the research I've read on the subject, and I didn't read that research until *after* I had noticed this effect.  
  
TL;DR: In my personal experience, psychedelics have been the best medicine I've ever encountered. I hate that they're not readily available. I really miss those 6 months where I was a truly happy person.

I know you say this sarcastically, but idiots actually do make up a large portion of the world's population. I'm not saying "everyone is stupid" or "I'm smarter than anyone else"; I'm not even claiming most people aren't intelligent. Hell, I definitely am part of the dumb public a lot of the time. But you can't deny that there are an incredible amount of stupid people on Earth. Look at what gets ratings on TV.  
  
Sure, advertising and all that is manipulative, loans and credit are available so that banks can profit from them, and there are a lot of people in terrible situations. Not arguing with you there. The way that people get stuck in poverty IS a huge problem.  
  
However, running up too much credit is still a stupid thing to do (unless we're talking medical bills or other necessities). Maybe someone feels like their life is going nowhere so they don't mind making a stupid move. Maybe things have gone so badly for them that they don't mind tacking on additional problems. But having such a shitty life that you are apathetic enough to do stupid things doesn't make those things any less stupid.  
  
From someone who DID spend beyond my means (and additionally had drug problems) and ran up debt for a while - I was being stupid. I was being immature and shortsighted. I let depression and a bad situation be an excuse to stop worrying about consequences because "Why not?". Just because TV made me want nice things and banks allowed me to spend more than I made does not mitigate my bad decision making.

You're making two separate points with your two sentences:  
1. Why aren't there threads about every minor dealer who gets arrested? First of all, that's impractical, and second of all, Ross accomplished a lot and contributed a lot so it's even more of a farce that he's being put away - he was part of the solution. He enabled a LOT of sales in a safe way. He was better for the drug using community than 99.999% of other individuals in the world. People feel grateful to him for making Silk Road - he contributed a lot to society (in terms of helping people get what they want, which I consider a good thing). If any other dealer out there makes game changing moves that benefit so many drug users and dealers, then they would be revered and defended to the same degree.  
How does this logic work: People made a big deal about Robin Williams dying, but there aren't big news articles every time ANYONE dies, therefore people on the whole do not care about human life.  
  
2. You realize there are plenty of political organizations out there that are both drug specific (like NORML) and just generally libertarian, right? This is a huge example of a major problem, but it's hardly a new problem. Changing legislation doesn't happen easily. Especially with drug laws. People have been trying for a long time.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:04:30
I'm not going to deny there are plenty of cases where people put themselves at serious risk to get drugs that are destroying their lives. And that is incredibly stupid on their part. That's a fair point. However, I disagree with your perspective in a lot of ways. Rather than just yelling at you or insulting you, let me explain why I don't get your rhetoric from the perspective of a non-junkie.  
  
**FIRST:**  
Why do we need to add another layer of danger to EVERYONE by making it illegal to get these things? In addition to being addicted to drugs, this addict now is getting less pure/more dangerous drugs for a MUCH higher price from dangerous people. So it's obviously worse for the individual than if the drugs were legal.  
  
The jacked up prices mean this person will be more likely to fall into destitution, steal, and hurt *society* on the whole as well. The fact that (by definition) only criminals can supply the drugs means that this person is also funding dangerous criminal organizations in the process of getting his or her fix. Sure, the person shouldn't be doing heroin every day in the first place, but why do we want to add in a whole slew of problems on top of this person ruining their lives? It hurts the addict and everyone else. Where's the advantage?  
  
**SECOND:**  
Let's say someone gets a lot of psychological clarity and spiritual rejuvenation from the occasional (once every couple of months) use of psychedelics. Would you consider that person a junkie? If so, then we really can't discuss reasonably.  
  
However, if you admit this person is just a user and not an "addict", do you think that the government should prevent this person from having these experiences that cannot be replicated otherwise? Not only have psychedelics been part of spiritual ceremonies since prehistory, but there's plenty of evidence that they alleviate depression in some cases for up to a couple of months, and I have experienced this firsthand with depression that is only somewhat mitigated by traditional meds (that I do take).  
  
The options that are left are:  
1. Forgo these unique and unparalleled experiences, in fact NEVER knowing what they're like if you're a truly law abiding citizen. This is ridiculous, as almost anyone who has experienced psychedelics (even once) will vouch for their value as a rich experience that can't really be replicated.  
2. Grow psychedelic mushrooms. This is easy enough, but if an individual is caught, then their life is completely over, sending an otherwise productive member of society to jail, costing taxpayer money, and doing no one any good.  
3. Buy from whoever is supplying. Again, now you're dealing with criminals by default. Some may be perfectly safe and reasonable, but often times somewhere in the chain of supply, there are going to be some bad people. Again, now we're funding dangerous criminals.  
  
  
**What is the advantage? I'm honestly curious. The only people that benefit from prohibition in either scenario above are: (1) criminals or (2) law enforcement agencies that get paid to enforce this standard.**

Again, no libertarian supports the drug war, and the ridiculous amounts of dealers in jail is a huge huge talking point for legalization and libertarianism in general. To say it's not an outrage or that libertarians don't care about it is not true.  
  
How is it not a strawman to say "Libertarians are false and inconsistent because they don't care about X" when they actually do care about it?

Seeing that this was a YouTube link, I was really hoping it was Numberwang.  
  
But no dice. I guess that's Numberwang.

To a degree he was giving death sentences to stop a blackmailer from ruining a bunch of people's lives. Sounds like he went too far (targeting people who weren't necessarily making threats), but FriendlyChemist brought it upon himself 110%

I don't know about "ridiculously evil", but definitely scummy, and *definitely* inefficient as fuck

What libertarian supports prohibition or imprisoning ANYONE of any race for selling drugs? What a ridiculous strawman.  
  
There's a lot of media attention on this, it's a high profile case, and for a lot of people it's personally relevant because they used the service that Ross set up. So more people are making a big deal out of this. If you want libertarians to make a big deal out of every drug arrest ever, well, there would literally be outrage 24/7 always. And plenty of libertarians are generally outraged all the time for just this reason.
