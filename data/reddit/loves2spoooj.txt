This is what I am talking about when I say tinfoil hat. You can't expect the every man to embrace bitcoin or even take you seriously when you talk like this. Even if it is the truth

10/10 would give private key 
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:34:20
Yeah people really are resistant to new ideas 
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:57:40
Yes it's true but you're saying it in such a tinfoil hat manner

And the public should be able to supervise all government transactions

Awesome event !!
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:11:54
Well I am comparing it to the convenience of bitcoin.

I don't understand why a bitcoin user would want this ....
@_date: 2014-08-12 21:39:53
ohh ok so it's just a temporary thing until there is some adoption?
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:03:51
Brings a tear to my eye 
+500 doge
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:18:49
Can I store these coins in mobile wallets?

@_date: 2014-10-05 05:04:18
I feel that exact feel bro
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:56:06
You can try and fight it all you want but at some point you'll use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:00:50
Yeah I mean did you know it could be used to buy drugs and fund terrorist activities? Of course they have to track every transaction!
@_date: 2014-08-12 23:08:14
Ok now I can see some good use for it in the future. It will be a good way for non tech people to still have the benefits. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:16:08
well spreading 20k does help but it's far from an ideal distribution 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:00:13
Based on what?
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:11:57
Consider? I consider we are in the bear trap area. The major public has not gotten into bitcoin yet and institutional investors are coming in.
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:22:27
Did you even read my full comment or just that part? You claim to see the truth but you won't even look at other arguments. You've become what you are fighting against congrats!

yeah I saw this when I went on Sunday and I shit myself
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:01:49
Fuck business insider. They report like an ADD child changing their opinions every market move 
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:57:12
So one dude sold 20k coins and the market shit itself? Guess we are still young as a financial system 
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:20:28
They just like digging themselves into deeper holes
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:17:37
There having a clearance event bro. It's different this time 
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:44:33
I asked the guys at their event they said 7% to buy and 2 or 3% to sell. Something along those lines. Very easy to use though
