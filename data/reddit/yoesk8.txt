If someone manages to do this, wouldn’t that collapse the price? I mean even if you get everyone’s btc addresses, if after doing it they’re worth nothing (or nearly nothing) wouldn’t that eliminate the incentive to actually do it?
For  example, thieves won’t try to steal your old iPhone 3  because they know it’s worth close to nothing (eliminate incentive, eliminate motivation to do it)

Yes, bitcoin is Illegal in Ecuador, BUT, I’m gonna translate the part of the article that explains this,
A representative from the Ecuadorian central Bank stated “although the commercial use of bitcoin is prohibited, buying and selling bitcoin is not illegal”

So am I! Hopefully we can have a peaceful and stimulating debate.
To be honest I’m not a software developer or an IT expert, but I actually like bitcoin from an economic perspective.
Here’s why: Unlike stocks, bonds, or other financial products, bitcoin is deflationary, there’s no central entity with the power to “print” or “create” more bitcoins, no matter how bad they want to, once all 21 million bitcoins are out there, that’s it, while the demand continues to rise, the supply will not increase.
It’s really hard for us to actually comprehend how the market will react, and yes, absolutely, Me and many others who believe in it may be wrong, but if we aren’t... It’s going to be bigger than most people realize
