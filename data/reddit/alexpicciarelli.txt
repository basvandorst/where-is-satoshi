What part would u like me to delve deeper into? Lol THC is absorbed through fat cells. Your mouth has lots of saliva in it which carries fat cells

THC is partially absorbed through the saliva because of the fat cells in it so he’s not wrong. You just get higher when u inhale

Your tongue has fatty acid receptors on it which absorb the THC

For future reference, that post a trade option is pretty legit and you usually get anywhere from 2-3% higher than market value when u sell. Still very sketchy if it’s not a face to face transaction tho. Also if you’re in the US and just trying to sell a small amount like that, just transfer it to Coinbase and connect your bank and boom it’s transferred. They take way less than all the Btc ATMs

Why is that against their rules? Gambling is legal now in the US? Confusing

It most certainly is lol sportbooks are opening up everywhere. We just got one in Pittsburgh. It’s federally legal now
@_date: 2019-04-16 16:37:49
Oh yeah physical sports betting is legal now federally. I just figured that would apply to online as well because ya know, why not? Same concept

6% ? Jesus Christ I don’t get why people knowingly spend more money when there’s so many other options

Wow that’s honestly pathetic... didn’t realize they were tryna shut down the online market. So corrupt

I know that was his argument but do you really believe multiple people ran the DPR account? With the amount of security Ulbricht had surrounding the whole operation, do we really think he’d allow multiple people into that account? I get why he used it as a defense because it literally can’t be proven but at the end of the day we know he was a 1 man show on that account. He got caught red handed with his laptop lol
