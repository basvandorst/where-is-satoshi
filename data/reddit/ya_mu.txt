Check the front page for Segwit enabled exchanges and wallets, it might help you pay less fees.

Amazing Project, but it would be more interesting to develop a visual identity based on the logo the we already got. The bitcoin symbol is starting to get recognized all over the world, and changing it now does not look like a good idea.
Besides, the logo that we have now is not something created out of the blue, it has an enormous work that makes all the [sense]( (sorry, got to go to work no time to get the original article).
A good example of this is what Metaheaven did to WikiLeaks, they worked with it and proposed a visual identity for the brand that was already stabilized.

Unfortunately, for the moment, yes.

I might be wrong, but I think you only pay taxes when you sell.

But if you use a single address for a single in and out transaction, there would be no problem, right?
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:06:38
And even if someone were to know those addresses, I would be more susceptible to [example 1 and 2]( than actually having my private key cracked, considering the single transactions, right?

I spent 1000$ in magic the gathering in 2009, and I knew about bitcoin at that time... Talk about wanting to hurt yourself due to stupidity

buy more
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:56:05
Yeah, I still have every card that I bought with that money, but I doubt I'll sell it someday.
But basically, that's what I am doing, I just bought some a couple days ago, and intend to buy every month a slice of what would go to my savings account.
But what about buying monthly? There's any specific strategy to buy in shorter intervals than an entire month?
@_date: 2018-10-25 11:49:19
Maybe, but in doubt, move them and be at peace.

They did not even gave me that option on activo. I tried using Kraken but for some reason they never verified my account, even after submitting all the KYC docs and contacting support :(

But at the same time, my Portuguese bank tells me I cant SEPA transfer money to the deposit account of Bitstamp or Coinbase because they are blacklisted.

Thank you, and I don't think there are rules for that, it depends on the person itself if they don't want to be exposed. But I can't see any problem with this particular situation. I am also doing a master thesis in blockchain data visualization, so it will be really helpfull to read other's recent paperwork regarding the bitcoin/blockchain subjects. And again, thank you my friend.

What's the thesis about?
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:18:54
[It is mostly because of the taxing problem of these tech companies.](
Of course the problems that would come with UBI or even with bitcoin UBI are really complex, but he seams like a reasonable person that would not do things without proper research and skilled people to do any sorts of implementation. It may even be unlikely to implement the crypto part to UBI (as UBI has enough complexity regarding fraud, and etc.). So this sounds to me that he is a little bit ahead of his time and that he got some good ideas to make things a little less shittier.

I mean, the same way that lightning is being developed in order to function securely and in a larger scale, the concept of paying the Andrew Yang's UBI in Bitcoin is only being taken in consideration. If he were elected, I doubt he would implement this right away, as you said, at the moment it might not be fit. But it is nice to see a presidential candidate being so positive and open minded about the insertion of crypto with his policies.

As he said in some interviews, he's considering as income related to the data that each of us provides to big tech companies (google, facebook, amazon from where the money would come from). And he has also said that this is no solution to the current problems of USA, but rather a safety net of sorts. Regarding the fake ID's problem, there are plenty of methods to prevent this, and it doesn't sound like a problem that would compromise the entire UBI concept. Just my two cents.

Yeah, the title is garbage, but this is the dip, the positive conclusion* of this article is to buy more when it crashes down, not panic sell. But I get your point.
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:02:05
Misleading is all there is to news recently, but did you read till the end, or just the title?


And even if the article (and it's publisher) is shit, we should be aware of what they say, because that might influence something.
