Glad you are here, wish I would of asked before starting. Pretty much 99% of the people on here are stuck up. They wont help you, its the mentality of Cryptos. They did their research why shouldnt you? ha whatever, I consider you asking more than enough research. 
Get an account with Coinbase/GDAX? 
I recommend GDAX and Binance also. 
Transfer that Bitcoin you have to Binance, you can do that without going through too much verification. 
Trade your Bitcoin for other alts in day trades. 
How much do you know already about trading and stuff?
