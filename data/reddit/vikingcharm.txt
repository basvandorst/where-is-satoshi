No idea the sat per byte but yes. I assure you. It was in dec 2017

Why would I run a node?  I am a casual user and only want to use cryptocurrency as I did in 2014. I’m not technical. Should I be?  Is bitcoin only for full node operators now?
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:22:49
Of course I use fiat. But I wish there were decentralized alternatives to not use it. As I said I’m willing to trust let’s say a reputable wallet provider to verify for me. Reputation works well with many things in life. There’s no reason why a normal user should ever have to even think about running a full node. That’s nerd talk right there and a denial of human nature-as 99.9% of people on earth will never ever run a node. 
So tell me. I’m sure you’re happy when your neighbor goes on coinbase and buys btc right? Maybe he buys millions of dollars worth. If this person is not willing to run a full node but rather trusts his ledger wallet to store and move his bitcoins around is he a fail?  Is this neighbor someone who just doesn’t get it?  Would bitcoin be better off if he just kept his money in fiat?
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:03:37
I would disagree. For me working well on a payment network means low cost fees to transact. Isn’t this why there’s so much hype behind LN? But let’s face it I’ve been following lightning network for years now and I’m just about out of patience. It seems mainly hype followed by people losing their money and other issues. I won’t touch it with a 10 foot pole my btc is too valuable to screw around with half baked solutions
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:05:51
Ill pay 50 or a hundred for an overnight package. Will I pay 1,000$. No. You are a fool if you think this analogy hold up with more extreme transaction numbers and queue.  Seriously. Appropriately priced is not possible on 1meg blocks. Think about it. I think you come to the same conclusion. If bitcoin use just doubles we are at “inappropriate” tx costs fast.
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:08:48
I don’t know about that. I hear nothing about btc development any more. But I keep hearing all types of stuff going on in bch.  Sure the price is shit and maybe even the security but how can we be certain this won’t change greatly over time? We’d be foolish to ignore what’s going on over there
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:26:10
But I don’t want to run a node. I’ve always used btc wallets like bread and never had one issue besides more recent slowness and high fees. Does running a full node speed any of this up for me?  Also, let’s say I never run a full node (like I have without issue for 5 years now). Unless I’m doing really huge transactions then what are the benefits of running the full node (in your opinion) ?
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:35:02
When I store my btc on a ledger or TREZOR both are amongst the safest afaik - so then in high tragic time I have to move it and I pay normal or low fee and I get hosed?  So to avoid getting hosed in fees I must store my btc in a non-hardware wallet?  This risk is not worth it to me really. And suddenly it’s exhausting to use bitcoin. Nerd money. Not easy to use money.
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:00:14
Stop lying. If you use it this often you’ll run into issues at times.  I guess I have to learn this queue tool thing and find a wallet that allows this. But when I move my btc from my ledger to this new wallet then doesn’t that defeat the purpose since I have to move form an expensive wallet and pu the fees.just so I can maybe have the chance of small fees on a better wallet?  I mean I just had to pay a higher fee to move it and each time I want to use the cheaper wallet I have to first move my coin from a more secure wallet.  What a user experience disaster!!!
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:47:54
Thanks. But I was expecting the LN to be everywhere by now. Haven’t they worked on this for like 5 years now? Wtf?
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:41:43
Triggered. Lmao
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:27:40
I want both. The way it used to be. I guess what you’re saying is that I can have one - which is of course still a very desirable thing (censorship resistant )
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:32:38
Wait, ok I should be able to manage this and that’s fine. But how am I supposed to get my mother or my uncle to do this? Am I supposed to refer them to this queue chart as well? I don’t think this is at all realistic or practical for adoption. How do I make certain that those I onboard today will have a good first and 2nd and third experience using btc today?  It seems like it’s just getting more nerdy and difficult. How am I wrong?
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:51:05
Paying under 10 cents a transaction would be ideal for me and the rest of the world, ya
@_date: 2019-12-02 05:55:22
Why is it like this after 11 years. Are the core devs really that good? Honestly? Can these code their way out of a paper bag? Honest question.  Personally, I think people treat these guys as special when they are average at best. They are just good on twitter and Reddit.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:19:49
I think you’re really in the dark. I wouldn’t have mentioned the development over there if there is none. They are implementing Ver cool things that work today on bch like cash shuffle  within wallets for fungibility , sms texting $$ , 0-conf transactions , reloadable debit cards, tokens with bearer shares dividend feature  , and on and on.  How is this nothing and no devs?  The community on the other sub seems thriving too. You should check it out before you say there are no devs. Evidently bch is also taking over Australia but I can personally confirm this. You also say the code is copied ... as I understand it it was simply a fork to get back to the roots of bitcoin and be able to build more on top of it which SegWit restricts.
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:25:17
So $8 fees are fine? No need according to who? You?  I’ve been in btc since 2014 and back then it was a dream to use. But lately all the expensive transactions and/or slow confirm times are making me think if btc is not ultimately end up as MySpace. A simple block size upgrade would probably help the network out for a few good years while other tech is improved upon. No?
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:22:05
I usually need my transactions in next block for trading purposes. I can’t afford to wait days.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:26:22
Maybe I overpaid. That would mean that some of the biggest and most trusted wallet providers are incompetent at setting appropriate fees. After 11 years is this the state of the infrastructure of btc? I need to fire up a node and check the queue tools on every transaction because using ledger will rip me off?  Why hasn’t this vastly improved over the years. Why must I basically go analog to dl things right and not get ripped off?
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:12:23
Oh , so the person giving me advice makes his own wallet software!  Impressive. Honestly. And I’m happy you told me this. But you do realize most crypto users are a long way from
developing  their own trustable wallet software  right?
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:40:46
Not free. Just under a few cents. At scale this creates a lot of revenue for the miners and they know it. That’s why they seem to support bch
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:10:03
Is there seriously a plan to reduce the blocksize?  Where can I read about this?
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:29:31
I’m using reputable wallets. Why are the wallets like Trezor overcharging me so much then!?
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:09:03
I can trust by proxy. Plenty of good people and businesses in the space very capable of doing something better than I can and worthy of trust. I’m not an exchange.  I’m one person making a few transactions a month. Running a full node is compete overkill for me
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:55:49
Ok so full node operators feel it... but why do many of these nodes need to exist? For novelty computer nerd play? Seriously. I’ll trust a big node operator or 100 of them to do this work for me. I’m not interested enough to run a full node and I don’t think we should be catering to computer hobbyists
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:06:09
Once a transaction in early 2018 took me 5 days to confirm. Is this not slow to you?
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:05:07
What wallet is best for this. And how do I make certain I can get in next block for this rate?
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:52:57
Yah I stay away from tricky. And I sure wouldn’t tell my friends and family to use something that’s tricky. Just isn’t happening. What’s the way forward here?  Tricky, slow, often high fees?  Where’s this all going? Seriously, I’m a bit shocked you guys find all of this ok. To me it’s weird when btc was working amazingly well in 2015
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:41:58
Bitcoin has become a pain in the ass. Grant it I’m not the most sophisticated user. But I have used it for over 5 years now and honestly to me it just feels like a bit of a fail now. I get it it’s still “Fu money as LOOP says” agreed but usability speed and fee wise, it’s a disaster from my perspective. And I wouldn’t dare onboard someone into this now touting how great it is. It’s just too much a pain in the ass and seems years away from significant ease of use. I guess it’s an investment now more than anything. Oh well
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:49:56
It would be nice if I didn’t have to pay an arm and an ass to use my btc. Do you even use btc? Surely anyone who does can relate to my concerns. Let me guess you are a “HODLER” right?
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:28:26
Nope. Try again. I was simply paying the minimum to get in the next block. Forget yesterday tell me what the fees were in December 2017 or even early October this year. Surely you see fees can fluctuate GREATLY?  No?  I’m not saying every fee is 8$ or that fees right now aren’t 50 cents but the issue is that sometimes they are expensive. Very expensive.
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:10:12
I doubt even a hundred contribute in any significant way. And these guys obviously suck at programming and cryptography because bitcoin is not yet even fungible and there are less merchants today than in 2015!!  These guys are a FAIL from my POV.  Grant it I’ll admit I’m just a user / oops I mean: investor.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:30:36
I never implied that I thought nodes store btc. Huh?  Lost me there with this reply. Ledger store keys and software sets fees for transaction. I use trezor too same issues
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:04:25
And I have paid. And it pisses me off. Is this how a network grows by posing people off?
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:07:20
Wait why is this so complicated?  Shouldn’t it just be easy and cheap to send?  Why do I need 20 links and additional instructions how to not get f&amp;$ked ?
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:12:40
I thought bitcoin was supposed to be able to be used by the entire world? How can a guy in Africa ever pay 1-8$ fees today let alone 100$ fees tomorrow.  Stupid much?
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:06:19
I’ve done what I could to evangelize and spread real adoption. But I can’t do this without completely embarrassing myself these days with the slowness of transactions are times and the high fees that these wallets give. I don’t want to have to pay a dollar to several to demo bitcoin to someone- yet as I’ve been saying this is the state of the affairs now on the network. If you have to consult websites and do calculations to send the transaction cheaply it’s just way too complex to encourage others to use it.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:06:56
I once paid over 200 in 2017 on busy trading day in December. Grant i I moved like 50k worth but still for me in btc this was hard to swallow and I think that rationalizing it comparing ratios is far from productive and also relegates it to a rich man’s tool and little more. Is this what we want?
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:29:29
Right. On that transaction I paid the wallet default normal or low fee (can’t remember now) and my transaction kept gl getting moved back. You like the way this works? Good for adoption?
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:11:24
I guess I should be happy this proposal and failure to develop (like most anything on btc) has a 2013 date on it.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:20:43
I’m sure many are bad but many are good and have serious venture interest.  So your generalized blanket statement is really a poor one imo.  ETH alone is a good example of this.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:28:11
An 8 lane highway would have saved me tons of money in late 2017 and save 1.50$ per transaction today.
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:55:00
Yes it would have. Or 8mb whatever.  It should be bigger than the current and anticipated traffic flow imo. You can’t expect much growth in the town when the only road in or out is a 2 lane dirt road
@_date: 2019-09-29 22:53:47
Lmao. I have a good stash of bitcoin. But I call it the most expensive shitcoin I own.  That’s the truth.  It’s become more useless daily.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:23:02
Doesn’t seem like this can last indefinitely especially since btc fee is like $1.46 today.  What will regular people ever use this for really besides hodl?  I think the SOV can move to many stable coins or basket like libra is trying to do.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:29:54
This makes sense to me but I just can’t seem to find a reliable low fee layer I can use today without the complexities of the lightning network.  Any suggestions ?
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:43:59
Yah I’ve been waiting since like 2015 for this. What’s the status on this. I read a lot but then read it’s still shaky?
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:51:19
I’ve been in bitcoin for 5 years. You sound economically illiterate. Ps: Bitcoin is going on 11 years old and the only thing it’s really used for now is to go in and out of altcoins.  Take away that use case and it becomes practically irrelevant
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:46:48
But it’s like 4-5 years since I first heard of LN. Why so slow to develop? Do I need to open a channel and run a node or?
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:10:16
So 10+ years later what are a few of Bitcoin’s payment tools?  What is the plan(s) to enable me to spend my bitcoin at my local pub?
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:56:31
Seems like this makes us more dependent on the banks and big corporations like Apple- which essentially are becoming big banks themselves.  What am I missing here?  How is this “decentralization”?
@_date: 2019-09-30 00:42:55
Haha where do you get this stuff!?? Honestly.  You are hilarious.
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:24:20
How can no one care about libra if fb has 3 billion users.  I bet they get more adoption on day 1 than btc has managed in 10 years.  I mean, where can I even spend bitcoin these days?  Also how are $1.50 fees per transaction irrelevant?  Can you explain this to me?  Many people don’t make this much per day.
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:25:42
The topic is more about bitcoin price dominating other market’s prices and why this is.  It’s about the bitcoin influence and dominance.
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:13:36
A bunch of crypto’s have value as we speak. Eventually this value will more closely correlate with the usage and ability to spend the currency freely and widely. If you can’t see this then you are riding the horse backwards!
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:36:18
But what about just a small handful of mining pools?  Destroy these and you don’t kill bitcoin but you cripple it to the point of uselessness. No?
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:58:32
I’ve heard all the arguments. Usage is the best case for money. SOV is only one of them. If you can’t spend it fairly easily it won’t ever have as much value as you anticipate.
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:01:39
Wow. It’s amazing to see such a patient philosophy.  In 20 or 30 years bitcoin may actually work for the world.  In the meantime we can assume our financial slavery.  You do realize that there are viable competitors nipping at the heels here— and while bitcoin tries not to break anything moving at the pace of a snail there are other projects which are coming up who are much faster and arguably just as secure.  And a 5 or 17 or 1 billion dollar market cap value is not really that far away from 200 in the grand scheme of things I wouldn’t bank on that remaining static for any significant period of time.
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:30:27
But it would have the same network effect as today so this is highly unlikely.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:23:31
Off topic how?
@_date: 2019-09-29 20:23:41
Unless something better than LN comes along then btc wouldn’t be the mirage it’s turning into.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:40:47
Sorry not looking to battle.  I’m just wondering why after 10 years of bitcoin it’s almost unusable
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:40:22
Nobody would buy it if they thought it would be a payment tool?  I don’t follow. The title of the white paper is a “a peer to peer electronic cash system”.  Also why even work on LN if what you said was true.
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:13:56
You just pointed out that small blocks keep it decentralized.  I pointed out that a few strategically placed drone bombs cripple the network to uselessness. That’s not actually decentralized imo. It actually seems quite centralized
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:20:39
How are regular people supposed to use this if it’s several years into development and you have to lead into noobs like:  “the lightning network can have complexities”. ?  Isn’t crypto complicated enough?
