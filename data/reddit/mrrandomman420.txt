Ah, forgot the +, lol. I'm not a very well trained Shibe yet, I usually just copy/paste and I typed it manually this time for some reason.

I have been trying to get mining Doge for a while now, and could never figure out how to set it up. SuchMiner has made me a very happy Shibe! Thank you so very much, now I actually feel like part of the community!

Ok, so now I'm confused. Are "bits" another cryptocurrency? Are they some fraction of a bitcoin? If so, how much of one?

I plan on building a few rigs and starting to mine bitcoins. I have around $5-6k USD to use for this. I am not worried about making the rig pay for itself, I just would like a small regular income of bitcoins that I can save up. I am a kind of guy, so I will be getting my moneys worth for that $5-6k. Is this feasible? Or do I sound like a moron? Is mining still viable, or did I miss the bus? I just want to turn my computing power into bitcoins and then hoard them, I am not trying to live off of the bitcoin money. I figure with like 4 high end computers running 24/7 I would make at least a few bitcoins.
