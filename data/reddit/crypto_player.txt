I thought IOTA is centralized until it reaches the ability to sustain itself? IOTA is super interesting imo, I don't have much of my portfolio in it but I am curious to see what happens with in over the next few years.

Not really, because an exchange isn't a bank. It's like if you went to a currency exchange, exchanged USD for euro, and then had to pay a fee to move that euro from your pocket to your wallet. You don't pay the currency exchange to withdraw, you pay an exchange fee (what a trading fee would be on an exchange)

Has the price stabilized? I rest my case.

It's also super simplistic thinking. Most people aren't very experience in financial management. I run a business with only 7 employees and debt management is a very important part of how we operate. If borrowing the money allows you to generate more revenue, and be able to pay for the payments and interest, then incurring that debt is a smart business move.

Very possibly. Seems to be less resistance to get over  $9k this time than last though. Might have to happen a few more times before it really sticks but who knows! (Literally no one knows obviously)

Of course it's a time suck. That's the point of it. That's like saying hanging out with friends is a time suck because it has a negative roi. I don't like Facebook but I run an alcohol primary establishment and Facebook generates business for no money invested. People still do look at Facebook as much as all you haters think they don't.

If you think the amount of money taken by credit cards in fees is for this, you are certainly mistaken. Lower fees is certainly one benefit of crypto / decentralization. 


Didn't know that, my bad. Either way, wire transfers are expensive so it is a fair comparison because crypto can literally do the same thing much more easily.


I never claimed that it was, I was really just trying to point out that crypto can be spent in large sums, quickly in the same way a credit card can be used (of course with the proper infrastructure developed)
I understand you didn't like the informal post but your response seems pedantic to me. If you're interested in crypto, which I assume you are if you're on this sub, I'd imagine you understand the points I'm trying to make and likely agree with some of them at least.

Just based on lost wallets?
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:18:21
I would bet there are at least 5 wallets for each person that own bitcoin. That means that if you call 4% of wallets holding most of all bitcoin, the amount of people could be reduced to 20%, which would mean 20% of people own most of bitcoin (4/20). I wouldn't be surprised if there are far more wallets per person than that. I have very little bitcoin and I have several wallets myself. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:47:21
Just wondering, who's going to get all the money then?
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:20:39


I agree, though I think in the short-mid future (next 5 years?), BTC will remain either on, or near the top. Until mass adoption actually happens, it won't really matter which is best. The most important thing will be hype for more of the general public to get involved and want to invest. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:38:26
Yeah I mean it was the top 500 retailers so I would imagine the scale would be pretty similar.

You think Reddit is the only avenue of information? I switched from a different account for anonymity when talking about crypto. Also, you disagree with my post? Or are you just another person who wants to point out how new a Reddit account is without actually using your head to form a critically thought opinion?
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:44:19
I agree.. only because after decades of it holding value, I invested in a promising junior gold exploration company for it to fall from $1800 to $1200. Fml. I hodled for about 5 years and it sold with me being up about 10%, but only because the project was so successful, not because gold price.

"Future projections"
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:22:23
I'm not saying it's doomed I'm saying people are talking like 20% increase is just what bitcoin should do consistently. It won't continue to increase 20% every week. It will bounce around. Also, a week of "smooth" climbing doesn't make its state stable. This is still a very short timeframe. It could shoot up and go up 200% or down 30% easily enough. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:42:05
If you think that a few stores accepting BTC (not as their only form of payment mind you) is propping up crypto, you're out to lunch. I'm holding crypto happily, but I'm not going to pretend that it is significantly useful in its current state. I do think that in the long term it will be, which is why I, and so many people in these subs, believe in it as an appreciable asset.

In any new revolution there will be extremely successful innovators and early adopters but that's not necessarily indicative of the trends that will happen when / if ever become mainstream. I don't think it does anything to stop capitalism though.
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:07:35
The problem with your logic is that you assume it is easy to determine when a dip is coming and when the bull run is going to start. If you sold at 19.5k and bought at 6.3k, good on you. No one can actually claim they knew that was exactly what was going to happen. The more likely thing that happens when you try to trade is you get fucked out of your position and you miss out on big runs or incur large losses.
Again, I'm legitimately happy for you if you're able to work the system successfully, but to say you're missing out if you don't do this is oversimplifying the market.
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:17:44
Eh most of them just talk about one or the other. They talk about BTC crashing but don't mention the gains. Then they talk about BTC bullish, but don't mention it's crazy volatility and crashes. 
Newsflash, BTC is volatile!
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:17:35
There is so much demand for bitcoin and so many people that will respond to fluctuating markets that the newly mined coins every day really won't make a dent relative to people just wanting to unload / load up on coin depending on market swings. The price goes up because demand goes up. New coins would be one SMALL input to swing the supply/demand balance.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:20:59
Just because it is used, certainly doesn't mean it is widely used. Price won't stabilize because some of the black market utilizes it. It will stabilize because the general public accepts it as a currency and use increases. I have done some research. You are wrong. If you think the price will stabilize because of black market us, it would already have as crypto has been used on the black market for a long time now.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:24:11


I mean, the thing that is better about is that there are lower fees and more money is able to be sent more easily. Most people don't have $1,000,000 credit limits, but you could send that amount of money across the world, quickly, with very low fees. A bank wire transfer would be the most similar, but those are expensive and you have to go into the bank to execute one. 
Credit card fees are taken care of from the vendor side, but in reality, those prices are passed on to the consumer because every company needs to make money. If these fees are reduced, vendors would slowly reduce prices (to compete with competition) which would be beneficial to consumers.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:28:01
Anyone who actually thinks a relatively stable  (relatively is the keyword here, this is still volatile as fuck for any other market) state for a couple weeks is a 'stable' state is out to lunch. Bitcoin always goes through calms and storms. This 'steady state' doesn't mean anything.
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:15:21
I think people are getting too worked up about him. Hes a great advocate for BTC, and he's a super knowledgeable guy and overall positive for the community, but his face isn't synonymous with bitcoin. I think bitcoin is already solidified as faceless.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:57:04
I know everyone hates their flip flopping stance, but realistically this is good news for bitcoin. The more major financial institutions legitimizing crypto, the less fear more people will have to get into the crypto space. ath's will only really be achieved if more and more people join the movement.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:27:07
Thinking in only btc is very optimistic. Right now it's a speculative investment. Later it might be a currency, or another crypto might be and btc could slowly wither away and lose all value. I think it's smart to have some money not in fiat in case there is a massive devaluation, but I also think having all your money in crypto is insane before there is any sort of mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:53:05
As long as we hold over $9k, I'm down!
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:46:07
Few, relative to all stores. Sorry I wasn't specific enough. A very small PERCENTAGE of stores accept BTC as payment. I'm not saying only some fringe tech shops are accepting it, and undoubtedly more and more stores are accepting it every day, but its still a minuscule number compared to FIAT accepting stores.
I'm not trying to talk down crypto, I think its extremely promising and will be a revolution into the future, but at this point its novelty and speculation.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:49:03
It is treated more like an asset because there isn't anything close to mainstream adoption at this point. It's better to say that it is speculative, rather than considered an asset. This is technology, not gold. Even if it is considered a store of value as it's best use down the road, it will remain so because of the technology involved. 
There is certainly nothing guaranteeing it not becoming the currency is use in the future, or at least layers on top of it (LN as the first big example of that). The thing that will transition any of these cryptocurrencies into a usable (mainstream) product will be mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:19:42
No, because it's 4% of **wallets** owning 96% or however much was stated, not 4% of people. If you say each person owns 5 wallets (just hypothetically) then tons of those wallets would sit empty. If there are 500 wallets, but only 100 with any coin in them, and 20 of those with all the money in them, that's 20% of active wallets holding all coin. 
Every wallet that owns all that still only represents one person. The only contestable point here is that one person could own multiple of these wallets in these 4%, which would mean even more of the wealth is in the top %, but that's tough to pinpoint.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:59:31
I wont downvote you because I do think the correction makes sense, but I don't think there will be long term stability at this point and i definitely don't think bitcoin will be viable to be used as a primary currency for a long time. The rate of adoption is FAR too low for that to be the case. Why would a large amount of stores bother with accepting payment through bitcoin if such an extremely small percentage of the population hold any bitcoin? It will take a very long time for it to get to the point where using bitcoin is the more common thing to hodling it.
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:59:31
I agree that is an easy thing to compare, but if you're moving BTC that you already bought off of an exchange, to a private wallet, that's not the same as using a visa to pay for something. That's the same as... moving a $10 bill from your pocket to your bedside table.

There isn't really any market that a 20%/week rise is slow. That kind of growth is unsustainable in the long term. Id say it's likely a correction up after the overcorrection down.

It's actually shocking. People are emotional and want to find support so they make bold, baseless claims. Another ATH followed by a crash? "This time is different" they said, citing about 600 reasons that any bullshitter could spew off the top of their head. 
It's actually amazing that they are completely gone. You'd think some of them would stick around warning everyone of the inevitable crash that should happen any second.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:18:37
Just because sometimes it is crazier, going up 20% in a week isn't stable. That is extreme. If it consistently goes up at this rate, it will be unsustainable and we will be looking at another crash soon. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:41:54
I think we need a system that you basically have what you would for online banking right now, and an app on your phone that you could use if you literally knew NOTHING about BTC, and that could pay for stuff at a lot of merchants without ever needing to think about BTC itself. I think that is when adoption has taken place. When you a have to copy/paste addresses, scan QR codes, check addresses, watch for confirmations, check balances, etc... it's just not accessible yet at this point for it to be anywhere near where it needs to go. I'm not being pessimistic, I think that just means there is a lot of exciting ground to cover over the years to come.
I think thats pretty similar to what you're saying.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:28:01
I mean for the greater good of the world? Yeah sure. For the opportunity to make money? Nah. The more volatile, the more people will stay out, the more dips you can buy, the more ATH's you can reach.

So I understand that the fees aren't necessarily high, but I have found that when buying BTC / ETH on exchanges (for fiat), I can't control the transaction fee from the exchange to my wallet. Are you just at the mercy of whatever fees the exchange sets? I'm happy to send fees with lower priority to reduce fees..
edit: it does also seem like ETH is much cheaper to move around than BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:25:00

I don't really get this. People are trading for tether for their other coins that are valued. It's not like people are just appearing out of thin air with a bunch of tether pumping money into coins, are they? Every time someone buys and sells with tether, no 'tether' really has to exists, since there is no net change in supply. 
Edit: not meaning to oppose you I just personally don't understand this 
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:50:45

Absolutely. I'm not saying crashing is a bad thing, I just get the feeling that people thinking it is rising slow and steady is in contrast to it spiking up in a day and crashing the next. Rising 20% per week IS part of the spike up. It isn't slow. Not directing this at you, just at the general feeling I'm getting from a lot of comments recently. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:32:11

I mean, I certainly hope you're right! Well part of me hopes you're right (the part of me that has my money in already) and part of me hopes it tanks again (the part of me that wants to acquire more over the next few months when I have the money available..).
The 'trend' if you even want to call it that, is looking positive over the past few days, but I wouldn't put a ton of money on it staying positive. These things are just way too hard to predict.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:37:13
I mean I understand that it might not be 'backed' by 1:1 USD, but I see it as basically a placeholder for all other cryptos? Everyone has to get in with real money at some point and I don't think you can buy Tether without it being initially in BTC/ETH/etc, right? So real money had to go in to exchange for it in the first place..
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:54:29
But that's what anyone trading does too. They wait for lows to buy and highs to sell, trying to read the market as best they can. Just because someone with a ton of more money tries to do the same doesn't mean they're shady. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:08:44
I own a small business (food and bev) and I'd like to do this, but I'm certainly worried about verifications, and also price fluctuations. If I were running a service job that I could charge my time out for crypto, I'd be all for it. For my business where we have a bottle line to meet, I'm certainly more skeptical at this point.

Pretty sure they were saying that they also laugh at people that say the flippening from fiat to BTC begins. They were saying that not just investment bankers are laughing at people that are saying that. 
On the other hand, who are you? How are you influencing the global economy? How is any individual investment banker influencing the global economy? No one really gives a shit.
