Some really excellent advice here! Thanks for posting.
Wondering if you can clarify this piece for me?


This is a lot of data, if we look at standard North American internet connections. The average NA connection could not download anywhere close to that fast, let alone the abysmal upload speeds. But what do these numbers actually mean? Who is required to download and upload this data? 
I guess what I'm asking is this: 2GB in 10 mins is a lot of me to have to download, but it's not a lot for a cloud service provider. Is it necessary for each wallet client to handle this much data, or could there be specific cloud services that handle this kind of large data transfer while wallet clients only obtain specific, small bits of information?
Please excuse my ignorance, I know very little about how this actually works.

Wow, thanks! Great work. Would love to see more. If you ever make more BTC art, be sure to post it here!

That is a really cool concept! I'm new to the BTC community. This is the first BTC art I've seen. Is the idea here that other people can scan the QR and send you a tip?
I love the idea of BitCoin. I remember reading about it years ago and thinking, "That'll never take off, it's too complex". This was back when CPU mining was the only way to do things. Oh how I wish I had put a few CPU cycles towards it back then!
I was much younger then, and I didn't quite grasp the concept that a good idea will be made easy by those who stand to profit from it. Now we have web wallets that simplify the process tremendously. If those had existed back then I would have jumped in immediately - but then, I guess everyone else would have too, right?

I wish I had the money to tip you for this comment.
