Have you seen the kids science fair experiment where you power a light bulb with a potato? If not, then Google it.
Similar to the potato, all different fruits and vegetables have different sorts of natural "technological" properties that can be utilized for different purposes (if applied correctly). The potato is a great conduit for electricity which is why it can be used to "power" a light bulb as seen in the demonstrations I just mentioned.
The banana is unique is different than the potato because instead of powering things, a banana excels at processing things much like a CPU/GPU/ASIC if supplied with an electrical current (from either a normal AC outlet or even another potato).
Unfortunately, it is very cost prohibitive to be able to harness the full processing power of the banana that nature has given us. A ton of scientific research is currently underway to see if there are ways to bring the cost of utilizing this natural technology down to a reasonable level that a average consumer could afford.
If you want some links to some of the research let me know.

you realize it is open source right? and all the algorithms it uses are very well known as well

Eh, to be honest I am not as happy about this as the rest of you. Many peoples minds have negative connotations about banking in Cyprus. Most people associate it with "offshore bank accounts" and all other sorts of negative banking/tax related things. I don't want bitcoin to be associated with that stigma if it became the "worldwide hub" for bitcoin. 
Basically I don't think it would do much to help the stigma bitcoin already has surround it ("shady untraceable money used by criminals to buy drugs and guns!").

Thats a really naive way to avoid viruses

What? How can you say that the people who use "shill" are opposite from the people who say "FUD".. That literally makes no sense. There is no barrier preventing people who say "shill" to later say "FUD". I don't follow your logic. Could some conspiritard not say "Quit spreading your FUD regarding bitcoin, you evil banker shill"?

holy shit. comments like these are what makes the bitcoin community embarrassing to be a part of sometimes. this literally has nothing to do with natural selection. like it does not even apply.
I know the bitcoin community has some crazies and whatnot but wow

The connection between MtGox and Eligius pool has been very well documented for some time now, especially right after the MtGox drama started. What is new about this? What does this information show allude to that was not already known?
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:46:40
wow what a unique thought like youre so right this IS bitcoin, we should be able to see where all the coins went on the blockchain!!! mt gox show us where the coins went!!
jk there have been 100 threads saying this exact same thing, and every time the OP thinks theyre dropping some real shit even though 100 other people have posted the exact same thing, and 100,000 other people are smart enough to realize they dont even have to post this because they know everyone is already wondering the same thing
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:30:22
No. They are still worth more than face value + scrap even if not a misprint.
@_date: 2014-10-29 02:27:05
they used to be run by a bunch of kids some time ago, don't know about now
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:43:56
You realize people pay a premium for these physical coins, hence why OP is asking about what it might sell for..
Obviously at the bare minimum it is worth btc price + negligible scrap value; but that is just completely retarded to point out due to how obvious that is and it neglects the fact they are worth a premium (this fact was made clear by OP but you seemed to have missed.. even after you were told again by another commenter)..

i really dont see why completely honest websites are gonna need to move to the deep web.. i really don't..
coinfire would be fine just moving offshore to avoid the current issues.

This is the stupidest question ever. I don't anyone at this point wouldn't take the USD if they lost any amount that affected them
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:34:23
do you think hes actually reading this thinking oh man thank you runarmy0f1 thank you for this advice i didnt know what to do thanks man
@_date: 2014-10-29 01:00:31
You should invest in some offshore hosting that doesn't care about DMCA (among other things)... 2x4, cyberbunker, etc
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:07:20
Amazon accepting bitcoin would be much bigger than this.
@_date: 2014-10-29 01:01:25
ok because everyone who wants to read coinfire is gonna install tor to read it thats likely
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:42:13
You shouldn't make jokes like that on this subreddit. Just go through the subreddit searching through the "new" tab and see how many stupid things people ask/say while being 100% serious.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:25:16
Lol people like you are why people laugh at bitcoin and think it is a joke.. This place is full of conspiritards as evidenced by their use of words like "shill", "FUD", etc
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:36:34
No, btc guild can not "theoretically do whatever they want to the block chain"..
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:09:06
just what we need, the main btc developer being buddy buddy with one of the biggest bitcoin "banks"/corporations
i wonder how much they're paying him
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:17:38
You're definitely crazy. Bitcoin is simply being corrected to the value to which is currently worth. Right now its actually just the opposite, at this moment it is very obvious that some forces are at work trying to prevent the price to drop below 50BTC.
Probably wont hold though

I did not get that vibe at all. I felt this video would appeal waaaaay more to people to that are not already acquainted or familiar with bitcoin. The video explained bitcoin in a simple and easy to understand way, in part due to its great use of analogies. After watching the video I do not feel it over emphasized mining at all, and only talked about it to briefly explain the security and inner workings of the bitcoin network. As others have mentioned the production quality was also much better which can be a make-or-break factor  as to if people will even bother to watch the video in its entirety (or at all). Not to mention, this video is much shorter. No one is going to listen to a 3 minute video in a cab about a technology that ultimately raises more questions and consequently confuses the viewer. The shorter "we use coins" video is a quick an simple introduction to the technology that gives just enough information to make the viewer interested in learning more about bitcoin without making it appear daunting and/or confusing.
That is not to say the other video is not good, it is actually great and very educational. However I just believe that the "we use coins" video is just better suited to be played during a cab than the other video. The other video might better suited to be embedded in online news articles for example. Where in this case the viewer likely has much more time to view the longer and more in depth video as they are already searching the web online and as such they can continue to learn more about bitcoin afterwards seeing as they already on the web.

Cool now bitcoin can be associated with drugs AND piracy
