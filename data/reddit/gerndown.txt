I'm building a linux distro to do exactly this. The distro uses libbitcoin and sx and includes a script to generate a random seed to build offline, electrum compatible wallets. Random seed can also be constructed using physical dice rolls. Once the seed is created all you need to record is the 12 word mnemonic to rebuild addresses and keys.
* [github source](
* [Screen shots](
Completely open source. The build instructions are available but difficult for most people. I'm building scripts so you can create the iso yourself from debian sources.

The global market penetration of Bitcoin is near 0%. Institutional investors are starting to pour money into Bitcoin start-ups to build out the infrastructure needed to facilitate the "mania" phase (2-5 years away in my opinion). 
The "stealth" phase experienced 3 price bumps: $0.50-$28.0/btc, $13-288/btc, $120-1200/btc. Each bump led to a price halving followed by 150 days of calm.
Local currency exchanges (in many countries), secure wallets, and merchant adoption will experience tremendous growth over the next few years. As the network effect takes hold the value of the network will continue to increase exponentially. Expect the bitcoin price to follow this trend. Don't "day trade" the hype - Look at the big picture.

This is the Bitcoin. Watch it hash in slow motion.
It's pretty badass. Look. It hashes all over the place. "Whoa! Watch out!" says that bank.
Eew, it's got encryption! Oh! It's chasing a merchant service! Oh my gosh!
Oh, the Bitcoin is just crazy!
The Bitcoin has been referred to by the Guiness Book of World Records as the most fearless currency on the Internet. It really doesn't give a shit. If it's hashing, it's mining.
Eew! What's that in its block chain? Oh, it's got a double-spend? Oh, it runs backwards? Now watch this: look FinCEN's up in courts. Bitcoin don't care. It just confirms what it wants. Whenever it's mining it just -- Eew, and it mines, transactions... Watch it reward! Look at that mining.
The Bitcoin is really pretty badass. It has no regard for any other currency whatsoever. Look at it, it's just hashing, and mining blocks. Eew! What's that? Silk Road? Oh that's nasty. Bitcoin's so nasty. Oh look it's hashing things and mining them.
The Bitcoin has a fairly long block chain, but a distinctly elliptical encryption scheme, and, you know, its developers are loose, allowing it to move about freely, and they twist around.
Now look: Here's a house full of gold bugs. Do you think the Bitcoin cares? It doesn't give a shit, it goes right into the homes of libertarians to get some liquidity. How disgusting is that? It mines silk road transactions. Eew, that's so nasty.
But look! The Bitcoin doesn't care! It's users get hacked like a thousand times. It doesn't give a shit. It's just mining. It doesn't care about being hacked by the feds. Nothing can stop the Bitcoin when it's mining. What a crazy fuck! Look, it's mining anonymous transactions, that's disgusting. 
It's hashing in slow-motion again. See?
Now, what's interesting is that other currencies like the dollar here, they just wait around until the Bitcoin crashes, and then it swoops in to pick up the scraps. It says, "You do all the work for us, Bitcoin, and we'll just profit whatever you mine, how's that? What'daya say, stupid?"
Look at this currency: "Thanks for the treat, stupid!"
"Hey, come back here," says the Bitcoin.
Currencies don't care, and you know what? The alt-coins do it too. Look at these little alt-coins. They're like "Thanks stupid! Thanks for the mining! See you later." The Bitcoin does all the work and all these other currencies just pick up the scraps. 
At nightime the Bitcoin goes mining, because it's hashing. Look! Here comes a fierce battle between a government currency and Bitcoin. I wonder what will happen?
Look at this, there's the Bitcoin just hashing a block, and then look, "Get away from me!" says the government, "Get away from me!" Bitcoin don't care. Bitcoin smacks the shit out of it. And the government comes back and it lashes at the Bitcoin. 
Oh, little does the Bitcoin know, FYI: it's been hacked! It's been forked by the 51% attack, so while it's hashing the block chain -- eew, that's disgusting -- all the hacked blocks are seeping into the Bitcoin's block chain, and it forks out. Look at that forked fuck.
Now the Bitcoin is going to fork out for a few minutes, and then it's going to get right back up and start hashing all over again, because it's a resiliant little bastard. 
Look at this! Like nothing happened! The Bitcoin gets right back up and continues hashing the block chain. 
How disgusting.
And of course, what does the Bitcoin have to hash for the next two weeks?
Transactions. 
The Bitcoin.

If you want to come out ahead, its not worth more than $300:

The rest is stored in offlne paper wallets (savings accounts) - diversified in case I someday lose a private key. Only the public keys have been uploaded to blockchain.info so if my blockchain.info account is hacked the most I can lose is the spending account.
When purchasing bitcoins, I immediately transfer them out of the exchange to a virgin (one-time use), blockchain.info address, wait for it to confirm, then divide it between a saving and my spending account. Get it out of the exchange ASAP. I'm not a day trader, so there is no reason to keep bitcoins on the exchange.

I ordered a 5 GH/s BFL Jalapeno SEP 2012 ($156) and began mining mid JUL 2013. Mined for 2.5 weeks for 2.0 BTC then sold it on e-bay and exchanged proceeds for ~15.0 BTC. 
Bitcoin exchange rate in SEP 2012 was about $11.50/BTC which could have bought 13.5 BTC at the time. For me, mining ROI is too risky. I'd rather have bitcoins today than the promise of hardware tomorrow.

A warning to the Bitcoin community, from an experienced Saver.
Don't worry about the daily price. Invest at regular intervals in products/services that you understand. For me, that's gold, silver, bullets and disruptive technology. Strange combination - I know. Three of these form a solid asset base and one is swinging for the fence. My disruptive tech these days is Cyrptocurrency and Additive Manufacturing. 
Wake me up in 5 years and then we can talk about the bitcoin exchange rate. For now, its cost averaged every week and these price blips are negligible.

Personally, I use bitcoin-qt on linux for "spending" and paper wallets for "savings". 
My bitcoin-qt wallet is encrypted with [truecrypt]( and backed up on [Mega]( I only store a tiny bit in this wallet (like the wallet in my pocket), so I'm not overly concerned with it. Every incoming transaction goes to a new address to help with anonymity.
My savings accounts are paper wallets. Once an account reaches a balance threshold, I create a new one (don't want all eggs in one basket). I create paper wallets using [btc-puppy]( which is a live linux cd that auto-launches a local copy of [bitaddress.org]( I always physically unplug my computer from the internet before launching. Private keys are written down and stored in two places (one a safety deposit box).
I've been experimenting with [ and [ as a digital way to save the paper wallet keys.

    What is Bitcoin?
    Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency and payment network.
    Bitcoins are digital cash you can send through the Internet.
    Compared to other alternatives, Bitcoins have a number of advantages.
    Like cash, bitcoins are transfered directly from person to person though the net without going through a bank or clearning house.
    This means that the fees are much lower.
    Unlike traditional money, you can use them in any country, your account cannot be frozen, there are no prerequisites or arbitrary limits.
    Let's look at how it works!
    Bitcoins transactions occur all over the Internet all day, everyday.
    Anybody running a free application called a Bitcoin miner, can participate in verifying the authcenticity of transactions.
    Bicoin virtually eliminates identity theft and fraud which are major problems associated with credit cards. 
    In exchange for their work, Bitcoin miners are rewarded with new bitcoins and small transaction fees.
    New bitcoins are minted at a predictable and limited rate.
    Your Bicoins are stored in your digital wallet on your computer, tablet, or smartphone.
    Which might look familiar if you use online banking.
    When you transfer Bitcoins, an electronic signature is added.
    After a few minutes the transaction is verified by the miners and is permanently stored in the network.
    The Bitcoin software is completely open source and anybody can review the code.
    Bitcoin is changing finance the same way the web changed publishing.
    When everyone has access to a global market, great ideas flourish.
    Let's look at some examples of how bitcoins are already used today:
    You can purchase video games, gifts, books, computers and alpaca socks.
    Several currency exchanges exist where you can trade your dollars, euros and more for Bitcoins.
    Bitcoins are a great way for small businesses and freelancers to get noticed.
    It doesn't cost anything to start accepting them, there are no chargebacks and minimal fees and you'll get additional business from the Bitcoin economy.

Transaction fees.
In 2009, Visa’s global network processed 62 billion transactions. If the Bitcoin network handled the same volume (approximately 1 million transactions per block), each block would net the miner 100 bitcoins (assuming a 0.0001 btc transaction fee).
If the volume ever gets that high, the price of bitcoins will be magnitudes higher, and transaction fees will be magnitudes lower (so 100 btc fees are unrealistic) . In the end, the network will find a value equilibrium - at least that's the theory behind Satoshi's genius.

Three part answer:
* Its a pain to ask new users to download a "fat", Linus Live distro, then run bitaddress.org on a separate USB. The USB connection is also a vulnerability. Running Electrum on a local machine runs the risk of being key-logged.
* I've included an option to generate randoms with physical dice. I don't trust random number generators either. The code to convert dice rolls to a seed and generate keys is all open source.
* I'll be including "build it yourself" instructions so the ISO can be verified.
At this point, I'm simply looking for feedback to find out if something like this could be useful. I agree, work will need to be done to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.

What prevents someone from installing the client on 10 different computers? How do you prevent someone from 'gaming' the system?


Bitcoins are currently divisible into 100,000,000 satoshis. One dollar will buy 800,000 satoshis today. If this takes off like many think it will, most people will never posses one full bitcoin. Like I said earlier, you're not thinking long term, where the value of one bitcoin could potentially be a fortune.

It's exactly the opposite of what the fed does!
The Fed increases the money supply which makes each unit of currency worth less. Those who receive the "new" money first have a buying advantage before the market raises prices. Over time, those who save are left with less value.
Bitcoin can divide the money supply into smaller units of exchange. The total supply does not change. All bitcoin owners benefit when another decimal is added (similar to a stock split). Over time, those who save are left with more value.

Once the blockchain is fully up to date you should be good to go.
Bitcoin-qt is the reference client and helps the network by relaying blocks. However, if you're not running it 24/7 there are better options for "normal users". I would suggest looking at [MultiBit]( or [Electrum]( for your computer or [Mycelium]( for your android phone. 
If you're trying to save bitcoin, use [bitaddress.org]( to generate a paper-wallet(s) on an offline computer and upload your public address(s) to [blockchain.info]( to view your balance. Never let your private key(s) touch an internet connected computer until you're ready to spend.

You could use a combination of [Secret Sharing]( with [PassGuardian]( and a [Dead Man's Switch]( 
For example, split your private key into 2 of 3 shares. Hold one share yourself, given one share to your heir (now). Create a dead man's switch e-mail with the third share to be sent to your heir. If you die, the unlocking share will automatically be sent to your heir. 
Alternatively, you could forgo the dead man's switch and document the 3rd share in your will. Because your heir already has the 2nd share, law enforcement cannot acquire funds by forcing access your will.

Then when they want to pay their vendors, they can import the private keys to completed transactions into a hot wallet, transfer the coins to an exchange, convert their bitcoins to dollars, then etf the funds to their bank account.
But of course, you're right. Eliminate the middle-man because they serve no "spiritual" purpose.

Too technical in my opinion. Would you explain e-mail by talking about how SMTP works? [Bitcoin.org]( does a fairly good job at uncovering the technical side in simple language.
I saw this in a post yesterday. 


Consider stepping back a few layers. The technical layers are a turn-off for most people.

Define share the wealth? 
I buy bitcoins with my labor, and then I'm obligated to share with you? If not, I'm an asshole? Sounds more like I'm indentured. If I refuse to share (or hoard as you call it), do you forcefully take it from me? I'm not interested in name calling, I honestly want to know how you make this work.

Bitcoin is a protocol for transferring value over the internet - just like e-mail (SMTP) is a protocol for transferring messages. Ownership is maintained through the use of digital signatures and a global, public ledger called the "blockchain". The Bitcoin protocol and the cryptography behind it has a strong security track record, and the network is the largest distributed computing project in the world.
Value is transferred over the network with bitcoins (lowercase b). The price of bitcoins has a history of wild fluctuations. Because of the fixed, limited supply of bitcoins and an increase in demand for them, the price over time has risen significantly. 
The best way to understand Bitcoin, is to use it yourself. Install a Bitcoin wallet on your smartphone such as [Mycelium]( Then, PM me your bitcoin address and I'll send you the equivalent of $1.00 worth of bitcoin. Once you receive it, help a friend install a wallet and send $0.50 to them. The "lightbulb" will go off when you observe how easy it is to set up and how quickly and inexpensively it is to transfer funds.
Bitcoin is truly revolutionary technology. Welcome to the rabbit hole.

I like this so far. Based on your advice... How would you split the private key between 5 immediate family members? 
1) All five could not generate the proper key until I died. 
2) If I was survived by only one of those members, the one should be able to reconstruct the key.

Originally I was thinking of one private key (deathswitch required) shared between members. This leads to the possibility of one gaining access first and not "sharing".
A better way would be to create separate private keys for each beneficiary and fund each account accordingly. Then create a 3-share secret for each (2 required to unlock). One to beneficiary, one to deathswitch (me), and one to lawyer.

Its a huge red flag! However, Bitcoin is not the problem - its the existing system with all its rules and regulations. Services cannot exchange fiat for bitcoins unless they can assure you're not a terrorist, money launderer or child pornographer. They assume guilt until you prove innocence and that takes time to establish in their archaic and untrustworthy system.
Once you have your bitcoins, its smooth sailing and definitely worth the aggrevation. You'll finally be in control of your money.

Bitcoin has the promise to be a convenient and inexpensive payment system for online transactions.
Bitcoin is a digital currency, a protocol, and a software that enables
* Instant peer-to-peer transactions
* Worldwide payments
* Almost no processing fees
* And much more
Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment systems.

I realize the conversation was about spending coins - no need to be condescending. I was simply pointing out that people should not have private keys attached to anything more than a bit of spending money online. Then, if your computer and/or software is compromised you're not out everything. Too many people have all their bitcoins in insecure environments.
