Why don't you trust coinbase? I've seen a lot of people saying that they prefer wallets. I'm curious as to why.

GDAX, Bittrex and Binance will allow you to trade in real time. Bittrex and Binance are cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency exchanges, but on GDAX you can use USD. 
GDAX also links to your coinbase.

Same thing happened to me. Both the website and the app.

It's crypto-speak for hold. It generally means 'sit on your investment for a bit' (but it can mean different things to different people)

Ah. I'm inclined to sit on my investment for a bit to see where this goes by the end of the year. I can see how that limited my thinking, and why coin base is a terrible option for some people. Thanks for the answer.

I can see it

So far I've read good things about them (well, I've read that they pay). I figure it's worth a try.

Here's a good resource for you. This sub has lots of helpful people from all over the world with good advice for those dipping their toes into the cryptocurrency world (with a focus on bitcoin)

If you live in the US, please do not drop out of school. You should never depend on cryptocurrencies alone. International markets are volatile and nobody can accurately predict them.  Stay in school because it increases your earning potential. If you have increased earning potential, you can buy into cryptocurrency later in life. You MAY miss a lucky investment that could potentially make you a millionaire, but you definitely won't end up on the street or working in a cafe for the rest of your life.
