I'd like one of their 1.25% interest rate loans.

If it is good for an individual investor to diversify their portfolio, why wouldn't the same be true for the FED? Wouldn't the fed be better off buying bonds from many different individuals instead of from just a handful of banks?
All the currency loaned out by the fed is supposed to be paid back with interest. Does it really make sense for an individual who gets their hand on that money at the end of the line (fed -&gt; bank -&gt; employer-&gt;individual) to give that money back to the government, when all of that money is owed back to the government by some bank in the first place?

u said 


but this:


sounds like lender of first resort to me
also sounds like a monopoly on low interest rate loans.

Lol inflation 
the people that get the new money first spend it before inflation sets in
The people at the bottom of the pyramid get fucked lol

the fed promises to loan to some people for 1.25% but not others
fuck the fed

those shitty variable rate market annuity's that pay like a 3% APR start to look pretty good if you can just borrow a couple million from the fed at a 1.75% interest rate.

i just want to borrow at that 1.25% interest rate
which is a negative interest rate when you add inflation

The fed loans out dollars that they create out of thin air at a 1.25% interest rate.
The people who get that money first get to spend it before any inflation from the new money sets in. 
Poor people who get the money last are the ones stuck with inflation. 
This is part of the reason why wages are not growing with productivity; it's a wealth transfer from the poor to the politically connected.

is this wrong? If the fed secretly transfers 1 trillion to my bank account in the bank that i own, I can immediately spend 1 million dollars and get 1 million dollars worth of stuff. After I do that a million times I'm pretty sure people would catch on, and inflation would kick in
