That makes sense now. So essentially this person could be buying up all of the other coins coming in lower than their wall, when they have enough at that desired price, they will remove their wall and allow the buy orders to push the price up again?

It's a constant reminder that we are all small fish paying this game. The constant "your guess is as good as mine" responses and ultimate motto of Bitcoin investing, is a bit scary. We are all gambling, better on the fact that Bitcoin raised in price through these initial years, and hoping it will continue to do so moving forward. There is absolutely nothing preventing the price from plummeting to $200 and then that being the accepted norm. The application and benefits of the technology are still there, just the value isn't as high as we predicted.

Pretty sure that whole project is destined for failure. From what I've read, "Liberland" is being claimed on a territory prone to flooding and possibly already owned land. The Satellite images of the land shows buildings already on it. 
Its a nice idea, but in order for it to be a reality would take a lot of monetary investment, which would of course muddy the waters (what incentive do investors have, other than some form of decision making or power in government).

Maybe I'm just a simple man. But does this now create a way for Chinese businesses to convert/transfer huge amounts of money between the two countries without paying any fees?

I have noticed a trend in these coinbase threads. They seem to have a very disconnected system (as in, it is what it is, if there is a problem, oh well). Not sure how often or how quickly the others issues were resolved.

Bitcoin is such a young currency. In my opinion there is no "right" time to buy. In one week the value could be double what it is now. If I've learned anything from watching Bitcoin, it's that it's so unpredictable.

Sold some earlier today too on circle, said 1-4 business days. Though I don't have Chase. I'll expect to see that in a few days I hope. 
(Then bought more Bitcoin after the price drop, just lucky timing I'm hoping. I only sold to test Circles process times and trustability)
@_date: 2016-06-27 11:32:55
Recently began using Circle. I've completed 2 purchases and sales in the total of $1,000 roughly. Both purchases instant. Both sales appeared in bank within 2 days of clicking "sell". Was trying out the service before involving more $
Edit: cannot speak for coinbase, I haven't used that service in quite some time and I forget the process time of my sales.

Please hold as long as possible. A little over a year ago I became obsessed. I began watching and reading hitching current events all day every day. Don't make this mistake, stay calm. I sold my 4 billion at around $700 each at that time. I was too involved and didn't just let them sit. 
Today I am kicking myself. I told every friend the advice I didn't follow. Hold that shit.

People are right in saying, don't invest what you can't afford to lose. 
Other than that statement, everything prediction about price is a pipe dream. You see it every day on this Subreddit. People investing pennies in the grand scheme of millions that are traded trying to be "Experts". Then 1 exchange has a fuck up and throws the price in a completely random direction. 
If you are buying Bitcoin for profit, it's all a gamble.

I've made two sales that were deposited to my bank account with zero issue. I've made about 6-7 purchases (of various amounts) of Bitcoin without issue. I even requested an increase in my weekly purchasing limit, and they upgraded it within seconds of my request. 
It may be circumstantial, the experience with them, depending on region, bank type, etc. I've linked my debit card and that is the method I use to purchase. They deposit back to my bank in the form of a "refund" when I've made a sale.

Thanks. I've tried Gemini's website and its just frozen for me. None of the links redirect me. 
I've also used Kraken in the past to trade, but always had difficulties depositing USD. I recently tried again and they require me to verify (I'm already verified to tier 3). So I've submitted a request for support from them. We will see if that turns out. 
I am trying again with Coinbase as that has been the most common site advised. I've changed banks just now to see if there will be any success with the new account and also submitted a ticket.

I've played that same losing game myself. Over the last two years I've lost $3,000 trying to be smart and day trade. I got so discouraged that I sold out of Bitcoin completely a few times. 
If I had held my initial investment and left it alone 2 years ago, I would be up $30,000. 
I came back in to bitcoin recently and made all of the same mistakes over again, recently losing out on a possible 2x my investment. 
I don't think I will ever learn. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:31:25
Because the huge number of Bitcoin enthusiasts who sold out of Bitcoin too early are now saying "fuck" and buying back in. All their friends they spent years educating about Bitcoin but always scoffed at the risky investment are saying "fuck" because they didn't invest earlier. 
A huge population is realizing their mistake and are now jumping in. Like I did. I've recently had to contact several friends and say "remember a year ago when I told you to invest in Bitcoin. I made the mistake of cashing out and lost thousands of possible profit" 
At least I'm sure that's some of the new traffic lol

I needed the money at the time. I promised myself I would buy back in after a short period but never did. I was also obsessed with cryptocurrencies at the time. I spend most of my day watching exchanges and it became too stressful. I made the mistake in trying to play the short game and profit off day trading. I did well for a while but took a few losses that set me close to even. It just became too much stress. I'm trying not to repeat that mistake and now investing long term.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:30:12
I've been following Bitcoin for a few years now on and off. Invested and sold out a few times. Every time I come back to invest and see how the technology is evolving, there are these debates and changes being made to Bitcoin. 
Would it not be wise to invest/support a coin that is already sound (not sure if one exists), that already posses the attributes we all want without the risk of corporate take over? 
Not that I don't love the idea of Bitcoin and have some currently, but why should I continue to invest my money in a technology that is so uncertain and the appeal is slowly dissipating (decentralization) with each new "upgrade"?

I was able to link two cards instantly. I am wondering if the bank has a lot to do with this. Like gambling online a few years ago (when some poker sites were still legal in the US) I had trouble using bank cards from some of the banks I used. This was all on the banks end, I had to open new accounts with alternative banks to be able to link debit cards to various websites.

I've been buying too. I couldn't see a reason why Bitcoin will not succeed long term.
Though there will always be this fear in the back of my head that I'll wake up in the morning and Bitcoin value will be near nothing. Some unexplained super decrease in value and I've lost a lot of money. All that is left is theories as why it dropped and why it's not recovering. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 18:32:41
I think this will get better over time. Like Kraken for example. They recently stated they have doubled the size of their support staff to handle the increase in activity. This of course takes time to train this staff and perfect the process. 
It's such a new system, that they need to be meticulous and cautious with every issue. They are probably getting hundreds of dumb I queries they need to filter through to find the serious issues that need actual support. For every "real" delay in some bodies withdrawal, imagine there being 50 more from people complaining their $20 transaction has taken over 5 hours to process, etc. 
These examples are rough, but you get the idea.

Sad thing is u believe the price will drop initially as well before a large increase. I am days away from a very large commission check and will miss out on thousands of profit from not being able to buy more in the next few days =(
I also have a small feeling that nothing at all will happen, the price will drop below $600 briefly and then even out again at $650. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 12:10:30
I feel like it's still too early for Bitcoin to be so stable. We need the increase in value to continue generating interest in Bitcoin (IMO). The majority of the population are just too cautious to get in to an alternative currency without the incentive of profit. 
Trying to explain the benefits of Bitcoin to any friends or family and they don't really care at all. Continuing to use their Fiat is just too easy and "safe" for them. I've only ever had interest when I explain the possibility of profit, which then leads people to be interest and begin researching for themselves. 
Not mention all of the publicity Bitcoin gets because of its investment potential. The longer the price remains stable. The less appealing and "boring" it becomes. Then interest will begin to lower from the masses. 
Just my opinion and slight fear. I always worry I'll ignore Bitcoin for a few months and come back to see the price a third of what it was today.

This is where I don't agree. If people wouldn't buy in to bitcoin because of 1BTC = $1,500, why would they buy in to 1BTC=$660? When only a few months ago they could of got 1BTC for $300? 
If you can only afford to spend $660, would you refuse to buy any bitcoin at all, or buy .5 bitcoin if the price of 1BTC=$1320? 
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:46:18

A lot of people keep saying they would like to be able to buy in again at $30, but if I've lost thousands after buying in at $650 before it crashes, I wouldn't be too happy.

We are all fucked. I think the average Redditor has just accepted that. We are all aware of this manipulation taking place, but we are so distracted that we don't bother. 
Soon enough this will be like Wall-E. All of us hovering around in a little scooter with a screen in front of us, being fed through straws. 
This may sound comical and outlandish, but think about where we are today. The worlds problems, some so extreme and vast. Then think about how many millions of people are logged on to some device or the other to play video games, watch live streams of video games, watch news and conventions about video games. This is just one aspect of it. Add in Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, all other means of distraction. Is it really "enough" to be aware of current events, with inaction to follow? 
Example: Rioting in the streets for what ever cause or reason. People being murdered in large numbers in what ever country for what ever reason. Countries economies crippling.
What is our reaction? We bitch and moan with rants on facebook or reddit. an hour later we start playing Dark Souls 3 for abour 3-4 hours and forget everything else we were passionate about an hour earlier. Till that next major news story where the pattern repeats itself. We bitch and moan for a few minutes or hours, then it becomes completely irrelevant to us. Like that issue magically dissolved because the next issue arose. 
Who knows though. What the fuck do I know about anything? I am going to go watch some Netflix.

But isn't the point of Bitcoin to have value and desire at any amount of it. So if bitcoin is valued 1BTC=$1,500, people would still want to buy and use bitcoin even if they can only afford to buy .0005 bitcoin at a time. That is the point of all this right? To get bitcoin to a point that it's used worldwide as a universal currency. For this to happen, it would need to gain popularity and value. Value adds to the amount of Bitcoin that would ultimately be diversely distributed.

The more I see news on big business and banking cheating the system (which I know has been happening for years), the less confident I am that Bitcoin will reach that worth. 
We are essentially competing with the wealth and power of the world. If they find out they cannot beat Bitcoin, they will invest so heavy in to it that they will ultimately control it, like everything else. When bitcoin becomes nearly as widely used at say the USD, we will see large "banks" lending bitcoin, charging interest, etc. Like the gold of the world, the majority of it would end up in vaults owned by the power and we will be given the illusion that we own any of it. 
Despite all that I hope I get rich as shit by hodling bitcoin till it either becomes so enticing to sell for huge profit, or its so widely used and valuable that I can live off of the amount I've held. Oh and technology advancements n' stuff.

I cant help but feel like my pin drop of investment in Bitcoin is so irrelevant at this point. The Market is just a playground now for these monster investors. It could go either way when they decide if they want to take it seriously long term, or all pull out and move on to the next profitable venture. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 19:53:00
I wouldn't suspect the price shouldn't rise at some point. The majority of investors are under the assumption that the halving is going to increase the value of Bitcoin. There is no definite date when it should increase, just a rough period around the halving. So for a good time after there will still be an expectation that the price will rise. 
I also feel that there is a possibility that the amount of huge investors involved in Bitcoin now will prevent the huge increase in price we are expecting. I see less and less about the benefit of the technology, and more and more on the potential for profit. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:59:48
I cant exactly blame them. A lot of people are utilizing their fast/easy transfers for gambling.
I've been using Circle now for a couple of weeks and have completed deposits, withdraws, and transfers without any issues. Ive transferred in and out of my wallet and exchanges. Deposited and withdrawn from 2 separate bank accounts. 
Never have I had to leave a message for sending the Bitcoins either. My Bitcoin to Cash withdraws have been within 24 hours completed too. 
I have seen some people complaining of their accounts being banned/suspended. Just think of the thousands of accounts that are running just fine though that we don't hear about because people don't feel the need to praise the service for working properly.
