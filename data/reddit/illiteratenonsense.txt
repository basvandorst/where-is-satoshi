I hold a lot of my assets in crypto and traditional (foreign) stocks after Brexit, because I honestly don't see how the UK will make any gains in the short term. The £ is up this week due to the government shutting down, but overall the outlook is bleak. I see a tumbling sterling.

It would explain the mad run-up earlier today for seemingly no reason. Looks like some big players were in the know.
However it was pretty obvious they were going to add BCH at some point. They committed to letting users withdraw their BCH already, and announced new altcoins to be added in 2018. It was just a matter of time.

People seem to think that the only reason people hated S2X was because they didn't want the blocksize increase.
Well, that's bullshit. I was completely against it because the incompetency of the 'team' behind it. It even failed to start because of an off by one error, so it waited for a block it would never get.
Things take time to do properly. Doubling the blocksize merely staves off the problem for a while. It doesn't solve the inherent problem. Off-chain solutions are likely the future, because combined they produce a better result than merely increasing the blocksize again and again and again.
I would support a doubling or quadrupling of the blocksize, as long as it maintains development of other solutions.

It's happening right now, look at Venezuela. Granted, it's not a majority of the population using it, but when 3 million of your currency is worth a dollar, and the minimum wage per month is 1.5 million, it's not hard to see why cryptocurrency is flourishing there
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:59:46
My girlfriend is Venezuelan, and her family are still there.
They have savings, luckily they also have dollars held in America, otherwise they'd be even worse off. Getting money to them is a big issue, because anything sent via post will get seized at the border, and only Bolivares can be held in cash inside Venezuela.
The local market in crypto is flourishing because it's the only way to get currency in and out without government control. 
Venezuela isn't totally fucked yet, services still run, but if 1,000,000% inflation (by the end of this year) isn't an economic crisis, then you must have very narrow definitions of what constitutes a crisis. 
You're right, people don't link to coinbase accounts - they hold the currency is their own wallets, you know, like it used to be before there were exchanges everywhere?

Just because I would do it doesn't mean I should recommend it to my friends. If I smoked and enjoyed it, I'd be a bad friend to encourage my friends to smoke too. 
I have a certain level of risk that I'm willing to work to, my friends might be more risk averse. I'll happily tell them what I'm doing in terms of investing or general financial advice, but besides safe bets like retirement funds, I'd never tell my friends to do something. 
I first bought into ETH at €260, watched it go to €360, and then a couple of weeks later it was down to almost €100. It didn't phase me, and I bought more at €120. Some people would be distraught at seeing those numbers, and I couldn't recommend buying into it, to my friends, for that reason.

We will be economically destroyed (to at least some degree). We have absolutely no plan for it, our government is incompetent and the negotiators even more so. We have no agreements with other countries, and if we're not in the single market we will be paying customs for EU stuff. 
We're going to suffer badly short-term, if not long term.

Most people have nervous hands, and upon seeing a crash will inevitably dump whatever they have, at whatever the current loss is, just to be away from it. 
It takes a stronger-willed person to see a 50% drop in value and not even flinch. 
Averaging down is a very good idea, if you think the asset will rise back again. In the case of Bitcoin it has a long future ahead of it IMO, and I can only see it going up (with some crashes along the way).

Coinbase will give you an equal amount of B2X, which you can then immediately trade on GDAX, rather than send it over and hope it confirms faster than B2X drops.

That sucks. There's been quite a lot of threads about accounts with decent stacks being disabled, limited or closed, on all the exchanges. Hope you get your account back!
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:54:40
Unfortunately you're wrong here. Bitcoin is defined by the BTC ticker, and has been ever since it was decided to be that. B2X tried to take it, but then it was given the B2X ticker (and it even failed to happen because Jeff Garzik is a malicious developer, but luckily also incompetent).
So good luck with your altcoins, I wish you well.

Bitcoin 'core' doesn't need the 'core' part, because it is Bitcoin. BCash is not Bitcoin, therefore it needs the extra qualifier.

Surprised at just how far it's dropped, bought in small amounts all the way down (€2800 to €2550), brought down my average quite a bit. Let's see what happens. If it drops further I'll just have to hold longer. This is money that won't destroy me if I lose it all, so I'm willing to risk it. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:59:59
People are telling you that you should hold your litecoin, and you keep saying it's crashing.
Go ahead, sell. The moment you sell, you've locked in your losses. I held a decent amount of Ethereum at €240 average, and then it crashed to €110. I didn't sell, I bought more at €120. Now, I make a lot more profit when ETH goes up.
You shouldn't invest in cryptocurrency, which is an especially new and volatile market, if you can't keep calm during crashes. If you sell, you will be the reason other people make profit.
Stop panicking. You have two optons. You can sell now and guarantee a loss, or you can wait and see if it goes back up.

September 30th or end of October. I imagine a lot of people in China will just transfer their bitcoins to the exchanges that stay open until the end of October rather than cash out in two weeks. That said, there's no guarantee. And in that month china could even go back on it and give licences to the exchanges without shutting one down. 
The Chinese government is predictably unpredictable. If the exchanges do end up shutting down, Bitcoin will drop. Maybe to $3000, maybe to $2500, maybe not even that far.

$3750 now on GDAX. I think the bottom is temporary until the exchanges close. Apparently China has granted some exchanges an extra month, and they'll have to shut at the end of October instead. It all seems a bit too convenient to me.

If you can, do a bank transfer to them. When the money arrives there, transfer for free to GDAX. That's the best option if you have to use Coinbase.
Unfortunately you can't make deposits into Coinbase via card, PayPal etc, so unless you do the bank transfer you will get hit by their fees.
If you need it right now, I suggest transferring the money, 2 days ago. Or alternatively transfer it now and wait a day or two.

I remember reading a post a while back about a guy who had a $700k inheritance, which was supposed to be split between him and his sister. He tried to trade bitcoin, and it dropped hard, so he sold. Then it went up, so he bought, and it crashed again so he sold. Ended up with like $300k left and him asking if he should just split that with his sister or invest more to make it back.
If you don't know what you're doing, holding is much better than selling low. If it were some shitcoin I would probably just sell, but if Bitcoin dies the whole crypto market dies, so in that sense it's a better investment than most.
That's not a guarantee it'll go back of course, just that I'd feel safer holding Bitcoin and ETH than I would holding say Neo

If Bittrex chooses to add S2X Bitcoin as a tradeable option, then you should be credited an equal amount of it into your Bittrex account.
Even Coinbase, who were firmly against BCH, are working on adding it as an option, so that people who held BTC in Coinbase as the time can be credited what they're owed.

You could SEPA transfer to Coinbase, then when the funds arrive, move it over to GDAX. The fees are pretty low, and free to transfer between Coinbase and GDAX.

When Coinbase releases the BCC they currently hold to the users who are owed it, I can imagine the price will plummet for a day or two.

Without replay protection one chain can affect another, which is one of the main issues here.

That's seriously overpriced.

Bitcoin Core doesn't accept S2X, and S2X is trying to claim to be Bitcoin. If S2X were adopted solely because of having majority hashrate, then why would they need their nodes to act as trojans on what they claim will become the minority chain? It seems pretty disingenuous to claim this is core's fault, when Garzik is doing all he can to prove that what the miners stated about what Bitcoin is (majority hashrate etc), is in reality patently false. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:09:46
The price bounced back because China gave exchanges an extra month before they have to close. If that is the reason why, the price will drop either on the 30th of this month, or at the end of October. The Chinese sell off was avoided for now, but it's coming. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:54:20

Replay protection would ensure that both forks exist, sure. But the market would decide their relative values. If a coin seizes to be used, its value will plummet, and in some cases will be removed from exchanges, which would suggest the death of the coin.
Contrast that with the possibility for replayed transactions, and it seems like the reasonable and professional approach.

Because it's an attempt at replacing the Core team, who have shown themselves to be competent programmers, with a one man team of a guy who literally just launched his own shitcoin ICO instead of working on S2X.

So it's an attack then. If they don't want to implement replay protection, it's because they want to take control of bitcoin for themselves.
