Assuming you're using bitcoin core official client, if you don't have backup of wallet version prior to this transaction, you may try moving this specific address to new wallet file, using console commands Help-debug window-console
Backup wallet file.
Launch client and get to console window. Use command
dumpprivkey "bitcoinaddress"
you'll get private key for this particular address, 
You may need to use 
walletpassphrase "passphrase" timeout
if you wallet is protected by passphrase before exporting.
Close client, rename wallet file to something else, restart client, after restarting client will generate new wallet file, get to console and use
importprivkey "bitcoinprivkey" 
Resend transaction with proper fee.

Are there any plans on any solutions to reduce blockchain size stored by official bitcoin client, maybe an option for user to start storing blocks starting from some recent date (summary blockchain snapshot up to that moment) in oder to reduce diskspace but still be usefull for network and avoid centralized clients.

* What about recovery proccess if device is lost or broken? BIP-0032 is used for Trezor. What options will be available out of the box in Ledger Blue? Are there any particular recommendations?
* Will 500mA lithium ion rechargeable battery be easy to replace? Which one is used?
* Is it possible to switch off physically different modules of device like NFC to minimize possible vectors of attack?
