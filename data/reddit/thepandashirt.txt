While I agree with the general sentiment of the article that we are at the beginning of a revolution that will put the power back in the hands of the users, you are confusing bitcoin with the underlying blockchain technology. 


This network is not bitcoin specific feature. So far Bitcoin has been the best at this network, but the party is over. The current network is way overloaded to the point of being borderline unusable, thus nullifying the value it provides for bitcoin. Claims that the lightning will fix our problems are pointless, as it still doesn't work and could be months or years away from being completed if it ever is. 
In that time, there will be another crash unlike any before. The true believers, in the past, have prevented bitcoin from total implosion after major selloffs, but now they make up a smaller percentage of the bitcoin owners. A large percentage of bitcoin owners are now people just trying to get rich and will not be anywhere near as steady during a crash. A larger percentage of owners will sell, which will cause the price to plummet. Then the beauty of a competitive market will take over, as some other cryptocurrency with the same underlying blockchain, but a better more robust network that can actually scale will dominate the crypto space. 
Over and over again we have seen that those who do it first don't win, it's those who do it best. Apple and Microsoft were not the first companies to build computers, they just did it best. Myspace came first but then came Facebook. I could go on and on. 
Edit: If you are gonna downvote me, tell me what you don't agree with. I'm genuinely interested.

I’ll bet all my bitcoin he doesn’t.

Where is the practical value? 
I see value in the blockchain technology, but that's not a btc specific feature and could easily be replaced by another cryptocurrency. And don't tell me there's value as a currency because the network is waaayyyy to overloaded and can barely handle the current volume, let alone the volume it would need to handle as a mainstream currency.

Its called a bubble; people are buying for emotional reasons, instead of being logical. 
This is an interview with the guy who literally wrote the book on bubbles and does a pretty good job explaining it.

I'm an academic and I'd like data on monthly bitcoin transaction volume for goods or services, going back as far as possible.

John McAfee is an idiot, desperately trying to stay relevant. The guy has a history of being involved with fraud and lost a fuckton of money during housing crash in 2009. If the btc community was smart, they'd distance themselves from this guy....

Why bitcoin though, not eth or some other crypto that could actually handle the volume?
Also, r/bitcoin is not a marketing platform for your website

It’s called good journalism. If you just give the bull case your just a hype machine. 
Giving both the bull and bear case leads to a healthy debate that needs to happen. This is what any reasonable finance news organization does.
