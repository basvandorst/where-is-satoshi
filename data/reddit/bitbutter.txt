Some things to consider. Noted down in a hurry, apologies for that.
1) Residents of the Bitcoin zone raise huge Bitcoin bounty for assassination the heads of the warmonger state, and whoever replaces them. Can be collected anonymously (see 'Assasination Politics').
2) A defensive voluntary military (coordinated and by cooperating insurance firms) in the stateless/Bitcoin zone, many times more efficient than the statist military they're facing. (See The Problem of Political Authority, The market for liberty, Chaos Theory, The machinery of freedom). 
3) The potentially war mongering state depends on the anarchic (let's face it) 'Bitcoin zone' for much of the foreign goods and tech it uses. Attacking the zone would put it at an important disadvantage relative to all states that maintained friendly relations with the zone. In the event of an attack the zone would likely find other states which would help repell the attacker (also because it would be in the interest of these other states to maintain the health of the zone as a source of goods and services, including armaments).
4) How would the attacking state 'conquer' the zone? Unless they destroy it completely (economically and politically unattractive in the short term) there is no seat of power to take control of. A stateless zone is a prickly target for a would be conqueror (same as medieval Ireland).
5) How has the attacker avoided hyperinflation and 'hyperbitcoinization'? The risk of these events occurring increase the more it creates new money.

The exact phrase i used was:


What I mean by this is that the state is the only entity that gets to decide when violence may be legally initiated (and of course it initiates it itself), in this sense it holds a monopoly.

What exactly are you disagreeing with here?
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:55:16


You did imply, though, that it was possible to structure the state's power in a trustless way. I think majorpaynei86 is right to insist that since you're dealing with an entity with a monopoly on the legal right to initiate violence (definitionally), a trustless arrangement is not an option--you're always going to need to trust that those who command the guns of government are not going to do bad things with that power.

Semantics refers to the meaning of words, which is pretty important when we're communicating using words.
In my view you are absolutely not for freedom for citizens, despite what you claim. But freedom/liberty are strongly contested concepts so maybe its better to avoid using those words.
You do implicitly advocate violence, and the threat thereof, against peaceful people to fund programs they would not voluntarily have paid for (since if they would contribute voluntarily, the threats would not be needed). This, to me, is reprehensible.
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:48:21
It's possible to conceive of rights in a way that doesn't run into the problems you describe.
Start with the presumption that the (only) right is for peaceful people to not have their property transformed/used/taken without their consent (negative liberty), and also note that a person's body is his or her most important piece of property.
Then you have a basis in which the rights of people are completely non-overlaping, in the sense that the enforcement of the rights of one person can never infringe on the rights of another.
There's still the issue of determining how property comes into existence, and the specific rules by which we deal with it, but at least if there are answers to those questions, we have a very clear situation, there's very little ambiguity about who has the right to do what.
The problem starts when people attempt to add 'positive rights' to this negative basis. A  negtive right is roughly the right to be left alone as long as you're not infringing on the rights of another, but a positive right is something that must be provided for you, usually by another person or peopler (eg. healthcare, education).
The trouble with positive rights is that to enforce them, you have to get other people to do work. And you cannot guarantee that anyone will be willing to do this work voluntarily. So you have to use threats of violence, either directly threatening the people who you want to carry out the work, or more usually, threatening third parties to pay others who will then do the work.
The threats of violence against peaceful people, that are necessary to enforce positive rights, are incompatible with a person's foundational negative rights (to be left along as long as they're not infringing on the rights of others). You're also left with an ambiguous situation in which it's not clear whose rights should be respected. These are some of the reasons that libertarians assert negative rights but tend to reject the concept of positive rights.

And you may be ignoring the fact that uncertainty about what future regulations will be applied ('regime uncertainty') harms confidence and inhibits economic activity. The more 'regulation-happy' a regime is, the greater this effect will be.


Here's another unsupported opinion stated as though it were fact: No, we'd probably be dramatically better off in the absence of all regulation.

The state currently imposes a great number of restrictions on people who would want to go into the private road building and fire fighting business. These restrictions are ultimately backed by the threat of deadly force. Contrary to what you're suggesting, then, the relative lack of private solutions to these problems in our current situation doesn't say much about the ability or willingness of private entities to solve them under freed market conditions.

* _Everyone objectifies_, opposing objectification is a non-starter, it's not inherently evil.
* _Everyone discriminates_, and at least all monosexuals are sexists (if sexist means one who discriminates on the grounds of sex). Again there's nothing inherently wrong with this.
* Nevertheless, images like this can alienate a large portion of bitcoin's potential user base if they're perceived as indicative of the 'bitcoin culture'. imo this is a concern that should be taken seriously.

To elaborate on goodcookies' response, you might want to keep it a secret that you're interested in that bitcoin address (since it could be inferred, from your looking it up, that you are likely to be it's owner).

A large enough population with AR15's, ready to carry out guerilla warfare, is something even the most powerful military ends up having problems dealing with effectively. It's no coincidence that most of the democides of the 20th century happened _after_ governments disarmed the target populations. Murdering armed victims is more risky and expensive, so less likely to be attempted.

That's not a trustless arrangement, not by a long way. ~~You're trusting the politicians not to spend 'silently' and you're trusting whoever audits them not to be corrupt.~~ Even if a breach of trust can easily be discovered with the arrangement you propose, the scheme does still involve trusting the state not to spend the expropriated funds in ways you don't approve of.

I agree that libertarianism is propertarianism, though there's no 'really' about it. Propertarianism is libertarianism too. Neither concern sits above the other: upholding property rights is essential to prosperity and imo to a morally coherent view of the world, but these benefits are what _legitimise an insistence on the universality of property rights_ (insisting on the institution of property for its own sake doesn't make sense).
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:13:44
Yes. Silly anarchists. There's _no way_ that people can peacefully cooperate to put out fires or build roads. Only almighty gov, with its threats of violence against peaceful people, is capable of doing these things. /s

To me 'the libertarian model' is simply the non-initiation of violence against peaceful people. So if a political proposal falls outside that, then it necessarily depends on violence and the threat thereof against peaceful people, to some extent. Perhaps you have a different idea in mind when you say libertarian model though.
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:59:46


Why do you think so?
I disagree. In the long-term Bitcoin either goes to zero and vanishes (imo not likely), or it supplants fiat, probably triggering hyperinflation-like events along the way. In my opinion imagining an equilibrium with room for both is the most fanciful position, even though it's the one most like our current situation.
I think the most likely scenarios by 2035 (20 years away), are either: 1. Fiat will still be dominant and nothing carrying the name Bitcoin will still be actively used, or 2. Bitcoin will be the world reserve currency and nothing resembling today's fiat will be in use.
I'd put money on either of these scenarios having arrived by 2035 it if i thought there was a chance of redeeming my winnings from you ;)

If fingerprint logs from different sites are collated by an investigator they could be used to reconstruct part of the browsing history of a user, even if that user has taken other steps to obscure their IP address (eg Tor).

You're making another mistake here. If regulation is out of the question, then each time an abuse like this mtgox thing occurs, the pressure multiplies for the market to create a robust _trustless solution_ (eg. decentralised p2p markets).

By contrast, a government regulation-dependent incentive system is extremely fragile and vulnerable to corruption (see [regulatory capture](

Interesting, but irrelevant question. Since in our current situation, the majority of citizens (never mind unanimity) who live under the rule of any government cannot be reasonably interpreted as having consented to be ruled by that party.
Moreover, even if a majority decides tomorrow that the state is illegitimate, the state will not permit this majority to use force. This majority will be killed by the state if necessary--to maintain it's monopoly. So the implied idea that the state is simply a servant of the entire population can't be taken seriously.

The government pretends to be the ultimate arbiter of who may and may not use violence. This is the sense in which it is a monopolist of violence. The state will use violence against anyone daring to defy its decrees in this matter. This is all plain to see.

"I do not believe i should own something if it's in the good of the majority if i don't own it"
Notice that you made your position sound more benign than it is by choosing to use 'I' instead of 'you' (which would also have been accurate).
In any case i find it hard to believe that you really believe this yourself. A couple of scenarios to illustrate what i mean.
1. There's an unloved loner guy. Nobody would miss him if he was gone. There are five extremely well loved people who all have terminal illnesses. They would each be saved by an organ transplant. If the loners organs were 'harvested' the five would be saved. Assume there are no voluntary donors. Do you believe that the loner does not own 'his' organs? (If you believe he does, why?).
2. If 'your' computer were sold, the proceeds could be used to extend the life of a starving person. Because of the fact of marginal utility net societal wellbeing would be served better by taking your machine and helping a desperate person. Do you believe 'your' computer should be confiscated? If not, why not?

Here's a hypothetical. Bob breaks people's legs, and provides them with 'free' crutches. It'd be frustrating to hear one of Bob's supporters say, rhetorically 'How would we manage if it wasn't for the free crutches Bob provides?', and this wouldn't be a very compelling argument to keep Bob 'involved' in lower body mobility. The anarchist thinks (i claim) that people are making a similar mistake when they point out some things that the state provides that they consider valuable--while ignoring, or at least not mentioning, the myriad ways that the state stands in the way of the peaceful and voluntary provision of that good/service in the first place.

You said:


Their hard work = their labour. Labour (to expend) is scarce. But your comparison to bitcoin doesn't work here. Thieves deprive others of the ability to spend their bitcoins (the BTC 'spends' are the scare resource that is taken), but pirates do not deprive MS developers of their labour (to expend).
@_date: 2012-10-13 15:03:30
Why would the company want to do that?
@_date: 2012-08-06 16:15:00


No. Money is a widely accepted medium of exchange. Money _prices_ are not a representation of labour either. If you want the full story, Man Economy and State is an excellent book, but very long.


No. Your employer and yourself both considered the swap of 8 hours of your labour for the FRN of your employer beneficial. So you swapped. The note does not _represent_ your labour.


I haven't said anything about labour in relation to bitcoin. You brought up labour with regard to the creation of MS products. Implying that it was scarce. My subsequent comments tried to explain why this was irrelevant.
@_date: 2012-08-05 08:40:54


I don't think society (an abstraction of a bunch of individuals) can't answer these kinds of questions about utilitarian calculus either. What we do know is that IP will help some, hurt others, and that IP implies that I can do something in my home that somehow instantly imposes legal limitations on what a peaceful stranger many miles away can do with his scarce property.

Consider a small company, just one or two people. They have the option of paying Jim in BTC. If they do so, this payment can be made effectively anonymously. And doing so (at least if they do this with many contractors) saves them overhead costs. They need not even register themselves as a business.
Given that BTC's potential for anonymous payments offers a way to circumvent the hoop-jumping and overhead of compliance with tax law, why would they choose that cumbersome route? Do you think people's belief that they have a moral obligation to pay taxes is strong enough to make them *voluntarily* pay extra, if they know they can safely choose to pay less? It sounds unlikely to me.
Of course bigger firms would likely still pay something, in order to stave off suspicion--at least at first, while the state can still actually fund the operation of it's tax enforcement arm. But the existence of taxation in the face of widespread cryptocurency use doesn't sound like a sustainable proposition to me.

No. Pay attention: Value is subjective. Value is subjective. Value is subjective. It's a very important principle, make sure you've absorbed it before continuing.
@_date: 2012-08-07 07:46:54




It sounds like you don't know what the strawman fallacy means. It's when you misrepresent your opponents position, making it easier to refute. Here I was emphasising _my own position_, not yours. This cannot be a strawman.


Sure. And value is subjective. Whether we're considering a piece of paper of a house.


Yes it can. I've already explained how. NB. It sounds like you've _already_ forgotten that *value is subjective*.
Value is imputed to goods (houses banknotes whatever), in accordance with their expected serviceability in satisfying subjective desires. That's what makes it subjective. You don't know what people desire, and how strongly those desires are felt relative to other desires.


You're espousing the long debunked labour theory of value. Seriously, if you want to actually get up to date on this this stuff, read Man Economy and State.
@_date: 2012-08-05 08:09:25


Advocating the use of Bitcoin does not necessarily imply the belief/feeling that a moral imperative exists that forbids a particular use of the Bitcoin code--such as finding a vulnerability and exploiting it.
I do not recognise the legitimacy of IP. Property rights are a conflict avoidance mechanism that applies only to scarce goods. It's not possible to protect ideas in this way _without nullifying property rights in actually scarce materials_. This is because IP sets limits on what strangers can peacefully do with their own scarce physical property.
I support Bitcoin in the sense that I think it's a fantastic alternative to fiat. And from my layman's perspective I don't believe it will ever be successfully cracked in the way you describe, so questions about the moral legitimacy of such a crack are irrelevant my enthusiasm about Bitcoin.
I see no inherent contradiction in these positions. 
EDIT 
Just read what chrisrico said:


This is a good point. The difference between cracking Msoft and cracking bitcoin (assuming it was possible) is that while the goal may be profit in both cases, in the case of Bitcoin this aim would be achieved by acquiring actually scarce (digital) property that belongs to others. In the case of microsoft, that would not be the case.

@_date: 2012-08-06 18:07:18


I don't know what your motivations are so I'll answer according to what I believe the motivations of 'people in general' usually are.


No. At least, the buyer usually doesn't care about the labour. Instead he considers the worth to him of the asking price in money (ie. the opportunity cost of the next most preferred use of that money), and considers the expected worth to him of the product on offer. The expected worth is imputed to the thing according to its expected serviceability in satisfying his subjective desires/preferences.
If the expected worth of access to the product is higher than the expected worth of continued access to the asking price in money, he buys it.
@_date: 2012-10-13 16:37:10
Please don't assume you know what I'm thinking about the conversation. It's a silly thing to do.
Please humour me:


Can you elaborate on what those reasons are?
@_date: 2012-08-07 13:41:59


If that were true then I'd be committing the _red herring fallacy_, not a straw man. Of course I don't think I've done either.


We have been discussing the value of goods since you brought it up. Since goods are valuated on the margin, the concept of marginal value couldn't be _more_ relevant.


Fine. It's a widely accepted medium of exchange. 


There is _no such thing_ as intrinsic value. Value is subjective. Please try to remember this, it's very important. A thing's value is a thing's position in an ordinal scale which exists in a person's head. Value does not live in objects (is is imputed to them), it cannot intrinsic to them.


I don't know where you got that idea from--or exactly what you mean, but it doesn't matter.
Bitcoin is valued (subjectively of course) by people because it enables them to do certain things very conveniently. ie. it is serviceable in the satisfaction of their desires.
Bitcoin is like any other good in the following respect: Unless they're engaging in charity, a person is not willing to pay more for a good simply because they know that more labour was expended to create it (although it's asking price may in fact be higher for that reason). 


No. Labour determines the minimum prices that producers will be prepared to accept in exchange for their goods. That's all.
@_date: 2012-09-08 12:22:50


A side-issue: One thing to bear in mind, as Rothbard points out, there's no such thing as money (including Bitcoin) being 'in circulation'. At any time, all parts of the money supply are held by people. Free-floating 'circulating' money doesn't exist.
@_date: 2012-08-06 19:33:42


I answered _why do you give them money_. Why we use money is a different question. It can be interpreted as:
1. how does money emerge, or
2. once money has emerged why do we seek to hold it.
I don't know which of the two you're interested in.
@_date: 2012-08-07 14:51:24


No lets not.


When that holder of that piece of paper expects it to be exchangeable for goods and services that will cumulatively satisfy his desires more completely than the use of the house would, he will value the paper more highly than the house.

Clearly a car or a house is _less_ valuable than these things in the sellers estimation. We know this because they chose to trade a car or a house for these codes or notes, and they wouldn't have done so if they believed that would leave them worse off.
Value is subjective.
As for how money emerges the first three chapters of Man Economy and State explain it all very well.
@_date: 2012-08-05 08:27:50


That oversimplifies things. Making a copy and using it in certain ways _can_ harm a person in the sense that it can negatively affect the market price they can get for the good they want to sell, even though it doesn't prevent them from using the orgininal.

As far as I know I haven't made any claims about what we're _not_ talking about. That would be silly. 


You brought up value, and you sound like you're confused about what it is. So of course we talked about that. Again though, i wouldn't claim anything as silly as 'this conversation is _really_ about X', I get the impression that's what I'm being charged with.


Not sure what you mean. If you mean no reasonable person would ever consider ownership of a piece of paper (or several pieces of paper) preferable to ownership of a house, you're wrong--unless anyone who sells a house is unreasonable in your view.


Sure. Bank notes are valued partly because people expect them to be accepted in trade. 


I've no idea what it would mean for you to 'diminish this value [I] have in bitcoin', it doesn't make grammatical sense as far as I can see.
@_date: 2012-10-13 20:07:51
Fair enough. The issue of bitcoin's less than perfect anonymity looks like the thing most likely to prevent it from ruining (income) taxation at the moment. If/when a technique is devised that makes this possible, I don't think the rest of the objections apply, at least to income and tax. 


The incentive is to continuing to be employed by that company.


Yes, that sounds very likely. 
I take back that BTC will 'break taxation' completely. I think rather that it's likely to make certain kinds of taxation *unfeasible* to continue. Thanks for the conversation.

Only if you arbitrarily ignore passages like you just did. Read it again:

@_date: 2015-04-26 20:10:24
Thanks to everyone sharing and commenting! The response has been fantastic so far. Two or three commenters have been hand-wringing about the potential damage this video could do to public perception of bitcoin due to it's inclusion of the term 'anarchy' [gasp] [clutches pearls].
A couple of thoughts about that:
a. You can't give a representative account of Bitcoin's origins (the aim of this video) _without_ talking about the mailing list where the ideas came from, and the general alignment of that list with the ideal of crypto-anarchy. To try to do so would amount to nannying the audience (imo disrespectful), and giving a misleading account of Bitcoin's origins. If people _are_ put off using Bitcoin because it's created by someone (apparently) into a form of anarchism then they're clearly not ready for it yet. That's okay.
b. I checked the video stats. I think they reveal something that might be interesting for others. Close to 3k views so far (slow because of its release just before a weekend). The worry about viewers being scared off by the term anarchism is not borne out by the figures. [See the screenshot]( The 'average viewer retention' graph line moves up to clearly 'Above average' level, with its (subtle) peak at the moment that the term 'CRYPTO-ANARCHY' appears on the screen. Not what you'd expect if this term was really scaring off large numbers of viewers. If anything the data so far suggests the opposite is more likely to be true--that the term intrigues people. If I notice that this trend reverses as the number of views increases I'll post back.

I've no idea if that is currently legal or not (i suspect not). But if the key was aquired without trespass, fraud, or breach of contract--for instance, if someone found a paper wallet lying on the street--and knew the contact details of the person who created it, I don't believe it should be illegal for the finder to spend this money.


An idea is _non scarce_ to begin with in the economic sense.
Pointing to the way that competition drives down prices gets you nowhere. There's some baker somewhere who would be earning many  more times what he currently earns if we simply banned anyone else from baking bread. It doesn't follow that we should ban competing bakers though.

What the author is forgetting is that every dollar that a person owns could be used to buy Bitcoins. So here’s a related question: “Why buy a pizza with dollars when it’s far more profitable to use those dollars to buy Bitcoins, hold onto them, and let the value appreciate?”
When it’s put this way the answer becomes clear: Even when the price of money is increasing people do not postpone consumption indefinitely, they sometimes want to consume things in the present, in other words they have a positive time preference. This is the reason that dollars sometimes get spent on pizzas instead of Bitcoins, and the reason that Bitcoins sometimes get spent on pizzas instead of being held on to.

No such assertion is made. You're committing the perverted analogy fallacy (and strawman). The only point made here, to the skeleton character's satisfaction, is that throughout the scenarios Jeff is _still_ threatening Albin with violence. The lion does not depend on the broader claim that the scenarios are 'the same' in any other respect.
Can you point to a scenario shown in the film in which you believe violence is no longer being threatened against Albin? (ie. a moment that you disagree with the characters about the violence they see in Jeff's different incarnations).


Many statists exist who really do believe that private roads are impossible--even though you might not. So this isn't a strawman. For an exhaustive but dry treatise on the provision of roads on a free market see 


Many statists disagree with you. They see the social safety net as the most crucial function of the state. You had no way of knowing this, but many parts of the script for this film were put together by lightly editing actual conversations with statists (removing the invective and name-calling).


Pay closer attention to the wording. No such concession is made. 


No. You're committing the appeal to ignorance fallacy here.

This group may have a common enemy in bitcoin, but their more 'clear and present danger' enemies may be one another.
Successfully shutting down/severely disrupting bitcoin using computer power would require these forces to act in concert. I'm not convinced that they're adequately incentived to do so.

@_date: 2013-04-04 18:34:13


Don't know what you mean by 'dead end' here. All valid private keys that can be used with Bitcoin already 'exist' in a sense. They do not need to be generated. But they only start to be meaningful when a transaction in the blockchain references an address that's associated with their key.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:00:36
I don't know if it varies from wallet to wallet, but if you request your Bitcoin software to display a receive address for you, at that point I'm confident that the software will have placed a corresponding private key for that address in your wallet.


That doesn't matter. When the software next downloads the latest blockchain data the payment will show up in your balance in the bitcoin client you're using.

It doesn't matter. Because you're not going to horde them _forever_, you horde them with the expectation that you're going to spend them. And eventually you will.


You're ignoring that you can currently swap all the USD (or other fiat) you own for BTC. So consider this: Why not sell every USD you own for bitcoin? Roughly, the reason is that you prioritize a given rate of consumption in the present (which you use USD for) over additional consumption in the future _no matter how fast bitcoin is appreciating_, in other words, consumption is not deferred forever because people need/want to eat (among other things).

Sexual abuse _is_ physical violence (aka. just violence).


But at the same time the definition you offered (which you need, in order to reach this conclusion) means that a defamatory comment on a forum--worded in a particularly effecting way--constitutes violence against its target. And this _is_ trivialising the suffering of the victims of violence imo. This is why broadening the definition in the way that wikipedia does is imo not helpful.
I don't see what we gain from calling 'callous commercial exploitation [of an act of violence]' itself violence. We don't need to do that to condemn it anyway.

@_date: 2013-05-15 23:04:35


Close. New Bitcoins do get harder to find, but (ignoring increasing competition between miners) that's because the Block reward diminishes over time. Unlike difficulty, the block reward isn't sensitive to the hashing power of the network. So difficulty could decrease in the future (if hashing power of the network drops for some reason), but block reward won't increase in the future.

As more people use bitcoins (ie. as the demand for bitcoins increases) the price of bitcoins increases. Consider that this means that each company that chooses to pay its employees in bitcoin (and stays afloat) contributes to the increased price of bitcoin.
More generally: with high enough divisibility there is no 'right amount' of money (or wrong amount, for that matter).

Hold on. It's important to know that Bitcoin-Qt also automatically creates change addresses in your wallet (almost) every time you send a payment. So arranging a sensible backup regime is a bit more complicated.
You may also want to look into a deterministic wallet client, like Armory, that runs 'on top of' Bitcoin-Qt. This avoids the risk of your backups not allowing you to access all your addresses.
I wrote an extensive walk-through on how to set up a secure offline wallet with Armory here: 
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:08:43
A wallet is just a file that contains key pairs. A bitcoin address (that you can send money to) is a long string of characters, it's derived from a public key. Each public key has a corresponding private key that allows the user to spend the coins associated with that receiving address (the corresponding private and public keys together are referred to as the keypair).


~~Yes.~~ It's not a bictoin wallet, it _is_ a regular bitcoin address.


You could choose to use only that deposit address to receive all bitcoins forever (or as long as Bitcoin-24 exists), it's probably not a good idea for security reasons. While you have a bitcoin balance on Bitcoin-24 (or mtgox) you _are_ trusting the operators of the site not to spend your coins, because they manage the private key associated with your Bitcoin-24 deposit address. 
If you do it carefully, the safest way to store btc is to self-manage a wallet (ie. avoid storing any substantial amount of bitcoins with a third party).
To learn more about this you could look into Cold storage, offline wallets and the client called Armory.

Harm may simply be a side effect, the aim is simply to 'remove [group X] from territory Y'. Similarly, harm could be considered merely a side effect of 'enforcing law' when it comes to a citizen who is non-cooperative, and prepared to defend him/herself against what they take to be their kidnappers.
If the former is violence, then so far no reason has been given that excludes the latter from being taken as an example of violence too.

Not at all. Your mistake here is that you're ignoring that there are benefits to standardisation, even between competitors. Notice that all credit cards are the same format, for instance.


If you're asking about the very poor, they are protected by either: 1. Themselves. 2. Charitable organisations that buy them subscriptions 3. Low-end local, and cheap defense agaicies. Also, the right to restitution is a salable commodity. So in the event of a non subscriber being aggressed agains, the victim (or his next of kin) sells the right to restitution to a defense agency, who extracts the restitution from the aggressor (this arrangement disincentivises praying on those without defense subscriptions, if such people exist).


... and to project a public image of being conscientious and compassionate (which is good publicity). See Rural/Metro Corporation for an example of a successful private fire agency.


The company that provisioned them depends on having customers who are alive and able to pay. The military is incentivised to protect their ultimate source of income--'the people'.

Good question. 


Yes. I believe that the legitimate means of obtaining land are through original homesteading and voluntary title transfer thereafter. By contrast the canadian state (like all states) draws a line on a map and threatens anyone who would use the land within that line without their permission--in my view that's the behaviour of a criminal.


Your improvement, occupancy and use of the land on which you live gives you a much stronger ownership claim to that land than the state has. But it's quite possible that your landlord has an even stronger claim than you do. This stuff would have to be determined in private courts on a case-by-case basis.

Relying on consciousness raising and the good will of miners is imo a unrealistic and unsustainable solution in the long run.

I'm of the opinion that suggesting that Bitcoin is _that brittle_ (as the alarmists are dong with these posts) will ultimately do more damage than allowing this accumulation of power to happen. If/when such an attack is carried out, and does very little damage, and Bitcoin quickly recovers, the robustness of its design will be confirmed in everyone's minds.

It's a good idea to use a new receiving address for each transfer you receive (which means a new private key), since it's less likely that your privacy will be compromised that way. Your wallet stores all the private keys you use.
I think most bitcoin clients handle this 'creation' of keys for you. I recommend Armory (which runs 'on top of' the standard Bitcoin-Qt client), which uses deterministic wallets--making backups very easy. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 13:22:20


What most people believe is irrelevant. The people directly involved in the inflation of the money supply--to the extent that they understand Bitcoin at all--are in a position to understand the threat that Bitcoin poses to their modus operandi (i just explained it to you), which they will appreciate if they're paying attention.


Where have I made the claim that they would?
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:49:08


No, that doesn't wash. Intentions and incentives are absolutely crucial here. Consider this: If all white males using Bitcoin coordinated themselves they could easily carry out a 51% attack on Bitcoin. Is the existence of this group a 'confidence blow to Bitcoin and what it stands for'? Of course not. The reason is that we have no plausible reason to suppose that this group would coordinate themseves to carry out such an attack.
The same applies to the members of this biggest mining pool. Most individuals in this pool would suffer if a 51% attack was attempted, so they would withdraw their hashing power were this to be attempted .
I agree that ideally this couldn't even be _attempted_. But what I think the alarmists here are overlooking is that individual miners are autonomous agents, and most of them are strongly incentivised _against_ doing anything that would harm Bitcoin.

Well for certain you want to keep a handle to those addresses that contain funds, and since most wallets (i think) generate new addresses to receive change, the easiest approach is to just resolve to keep track of them all.
I'm using Armory at the moment which works with a deterministic wallet approach, I think this is a bit more elegant, as you only really need the 'seed' codes to (re)generate a whole series of keys--this makes backing up a bit simpler imo:

Demanding that a peaceful person--who had no agreement with you--hand over their possessions, under the ultimate threat of deadly force, is  theft. Similar to mugging.
As far as I'm aware, I made no agreement with the state that taxes me (and if i did, it was certainly under duress, and thus invalid).
I hope you agree, but if not, I'd be interested to hear why not.

I understand that. I was asking about whether the requirement to have processors solve problems that take (processor) time was implemented to reduce the likelihood that the originator of a given transaction would be the same miner who happened to solve the block that that transaction is contained within. Is this a concern?


That makes sense to me--a delay in block confirmation caused by a proof of work requirement means that its much more likely that there'll be only one clear 'solver' per block.

If you're talking about ideas/recipes/patterns (ie. the things that IP advocates believe are property), I _don't_ think it's aggression to manifest these things and sell their physical manifestations. Here's what I said again for your convenience, because i think you misread it (emphasis added):
I believe it's an act of aggression **to threaten force against anyone using their own rivalrous property** to sell for a profit any manifestation of a pattern (unless they have entered into a contract promising not to do so).


Sure, the ones who've mades their livelihood on what I take to be an immoral law. Whenever any bad law is removed someone somewhere will suffer because they based their livelihood on the existence of that law.


These are quite different situations. In the case of the house, the buyer has an agreement with the seller, in the case of what gets called IP, the person perceiving the pattern does not necessarily have any agreement with it's originator about how that pattern may be used--and so imposing restrictions on this person in order to try to safeguard the profitability of said idea is aggression.

Hi op. First i think its important to notice that nowhere ever has a group unanimously come together to form a state to secure the advantages you believe that a state offers.

The stories that people eventually come to tell to try to justify this state of events can't erase this reality.

Should we believe that a representative democracy (inherently affected by rational ignorance, asymmetrical lobbying, and the incentives of 'caretaker' leaders to maximise their short term gain rather than safeguard the long-term solvency of the nation) improves this situation? I see no reason to believe that it would. I do see reasons to expect it to make matters worse by forcing people who hate each other, to associate (via 'public funds').


I'm sure many people would feel the same. Which means there'd be a market for middle-men providing 'package deals' of this sort, and a market for agencies reviewing these various deals.


There wouldn't necessarily be any such voting. Check the video I linked.


When there is fierce competition between firms, against a consistently upheld background of enforced property rights, the consumer benefits enormously. When there is a coercive monopoly, the consumer suffers.


I agree that it's unlikely to happen in already established cities, in our lifetimes, as a result of ideological change. But there are other important ways it could happen, (technological revolution, economic collapse) and you don't know that it won't.

Food is serviceable in keeping a human body alive. But by claiming that food has value for this reason, you're implicitly assuming that an alive human body is preferable to a dead one.

There's no escaping value subjectivity.

I think you're overlooking the fact that the 'required amount of social services' is not fixed (however you define 'required'). And to a degree you get more of whatever you subsidise, including dependence.
More generally, I believe that the requirement that peaceful people be free from violence and threats of violence comes before whatever social services you believe should be provided--and is incompatible with their provision via taxation.
@_date: 2013-02-09 21:17:20




I'm referring to the state, the coercive monopolist that 'provides' us with its police services, whether we want them or not.
Can you at least agree that the following is an accurate characterisation of the system you advocate:
An entity with an absolute coercive monopoly on the provision of police services, operating without any concern for attracting or keeping customers (ie. not concerned with profit). With an inexhaustible revenue stream extracted from citizens under threat of force.
And whether you agree or not, can you understand why, to some, this sounds utterly immoral and a recipe for tyranny?

Oh i wouldn't advocate using Bitcoin for illegal activity for the _sole reason that it's illegal_. I'd hope that peaceful people breaking unjust laws do so for other reasons too--maximising their subjective wellbeing.


Don't know what you mean.


I welcome the 'aggressive solutions', because I believe they'll ultimately fail. And the impotence of the state in this realm will be demonstrated very clearly. And under ideal conditions this conspicuous failure will be the 'green light' for the blossoming of a truly freed market.


The difference is that you believe the state will ultimately triumph (and perhaps you want it to). I don't believe it will, and I don't want it to.
Your envisage the state ultimately _permitting_ us to use cryptocurrency--and you don't want to jeopardise this arrangement by angering leviathan.
I believe the state, as an institution, is on it's way to collapse, and Bitcoin is perfectly placed to be a catalyst to that change.
I hope this explains why your charge of selfishness only makes sense against the set of expectations that I don't share with you.

I suppose you could say that with increases in overall hashing power, the extra money an attacker would need to invest to mount a successful attack grows faster than the extra money a honest miner would have to invest to run a profit. So this does seem to translate to a reasonable expectation that the likelihood of a successful attack diminishes as hashing power grows.

It sounds like you don't yet understand how bitcoin works. I recommend reading the white paper.
You cannot actually store bitcoins on your drive, because 'your bitcoins' are really numbers on the distributed public ledger--if you want to say they're stored anywhere, they're stored 'in' the blockchain.
What's stored on your drive is references to the addresses that your funds are connected with, and the private keys to spend those funds.

Not bitcoin specific but relevant for those who want to have heirs inherit their btc: a deathswitch-like web service that:

This is an unusually narrow definition of violence. I don't think you believe this yourself. If you did, you'd have to insist (for instance) that a brutal and bloody genocide could be non-violent--since its perpetrators were carrying it out in the service of geo-political ends (and not harming others for the sake of doing harm). Or that being a mugger or rapist was not necessarily a violent occupation since in both cases the attacks (or threatened attacks) were carried out to serve an end other than harm for its own sake.


You're forgiven ;) As I hope you'll forgive me for not wanting to explain what I think is already far better explained in a book (it's really just 2 chapters of TMoF that you'd have to read to get the idea, and a bit more of Chaos Theory).

I'm a productive man prospering from my work, not depending on IP. So you're mistaken there.


There is no right to life. Just as there are no positive rights in general, only negative ones.


I agree. 


Property rights in rivalrous goods are more than sufficient to sustain life and avoid conflict. So-called IP is incompatible with property rights in rivalrous goods (ie. it's incompatible with actual property rights). This is because IP says that peaceful strangers may no longer freely use their property in certain ways once a pattern has manifested itself in the world, even though the victim has made no agreement with the one who released the pattern into the world.

As to why this can't be used to solve other problems at the same time: Hashing is a good 'proof of work' task because there's no known way to predict hash values in advance of actually hashing the input. As others have mentioned, if someone can find a way to provide credible proof of work while solvig other problems they'll achieve fame (and maybe fortune).

Disclaimer: please correct me anyone if any of this is not accurate.


 
A solved block tells the network 'It took roughly ten minutes of frantic hashing by all miners in the network before one of them found this solution'. The solution can quickly be checked for validity. This is the 'proof of work' that bitcoin uses. Since blocks contain references to previous blocks, a given chain of solved blocks represent a chunk of 'work'. 
Rather than honestly try to solve the current transactions into a new block, a dishonest node could try to solve a set of 'made-up' transactions and get them added to the blockchain ([there's a limit to the damage that can be done this way]( but it makes double spending possible for instance). But a regular user is extremely unlikely to be the one to solve the next block, unless he/she has access to more than 50% of the entire hashing power of the network, hence the '51% attack'. Thus the solved blocks (and especially older solved blocks) act as a kind of assurance that 'The bitcoin network as a whole approves this set of transactions'.
What the block solving requirement also does is provide the network with Byzantine fault tolerance. It provides a robust way for the network to quickly reach consensus about which the legitimate blockchain blocks are. [Here's Satoshi explaining the problem and solution with a nice metaphor](

Of course. And these (relatively) poor conditions, just like child labour, are a consequence of low capital investment, as any decent intermediate economics textbook would inform you.
As societies move from low capital investment to higher capital investment in industry, firms competing for employees can afford to offer increasingly attractive working conditions (and families can afford not to send their kids to the factory), and so they do so.
The last five years of Chinese industry is a vivid example of this process happening faster than usual.
(If you look closely you'll find that lawmakers and lobbyists enact laws securing these improved conditions only _after_ these improvements are well under way).


I want you to point to a harm that's been caused by the free market, not merely poor working conditions that always accompany low capital investment.

Right now it fits, but doesn't reflect the central role of miners in maintaining the blockchain. Eventually (if) when the block reward goes to zero, mining will be an even worse metaphor, since nothing will be being 'mined' ('miners' will be 'in it' exclusively for the transaction fees).
TL;DR: mining is a poor metaphor.

I understand you. But my complaint here is that _right now_ as new bitcoin happens to be entering the system, 'mining' makes much more sense as a label than it will do when 'miners' are competing for transaction fees only. Since transaction fees are not new units of BTC.
So in this way, mining is not an appropriate name for what those nodes will be doing over the lifetime of bitcoin
1. Because later on the resemblance to physical mining will be very tenuous.
2. Because 'mining' masks the crucial significance of what those nodes are doing for the continued functioning of the bitcoin system.
A decent counter-argument is that 'mining' is a smart term to use at the start of bitcoin's lifetime, because it quickly communicates that a reward is involved in doing this activity.

About altruism: You can be selfish while helping those around you (trade works that way for instance). One of the ways that the state short-circuits what I believe is people's natural tendency to help one-another is by instituting the compulsory welfare state. Through that institution, people already feel as though they're 'doing their part' through taxation. But meanwhile this form of depersonalised wealth redistribution is cut free from the kind of social control that used to apply to local charity (if a person lives on your street, you have a better idea of whether or not they're genuinely in need of aid or not)--creating a situation in which there's a greater incentive for individuals to 'cheat', and a greater incentive for politicians to promise more benefits to secure more votes.

Bitcoin holders are more likely to spend USD on toilet paper than BTC on toilet paper, but this _isn't because Bitcoin is appreciating_, it's because of a combination of the following things:

Key: One of a pair of cryptographic keys. One is called the public key and one the private key. In the context of bitcoin, a bitcoin address (the code that you reveal to another person if you want them to send you money) is derived from a _public_ key. The corresponding _private_ key allows the holder to spend the funds associated with the address in question. Bitcoin funds are transferred between users by the sender 'signing' a transaction with the private key(s) belonging to the address(es) from which the funds will be sent.
Wallet: A file containing one or more private keys, as well as additional information. Wallet files are typically created automatically and managed by Bitcoin clients. If a person has access to your unencrypted wallet, they are able to spend the funds associated with the private keys it contains. It's important to realise that _a wallet does not contain Bitcoins_, rather it contains keys that allows the user to spend the bitcoins associated with those addresses.
Brain wallet: A private key can be represented as a long string of numbers and letters. If you take a written sentence, it's possible to pass this through an algorithm that transforms it into a valid private key (all private keys 'exist' already, as far as the network is concerned, they do not have to be created in order to first be used). This means that a user can think of a long and obscure passphrase and commit this to their memory. 
Using a service like  (preferably offline, on a computer trusted not to contain malware) the user can enter the passphrase and the private key and corresponding address (for receiving funds) will be reconstructed.

Calories are currently needed to stay alive. Your mistake is assuming that all people at all times place infinite value on staying alive. They clearly don't.
Short term survival is a goal that competes with many others. People impute value to goods (including goods that facilitate survival) in accordance with how serviceable those goods are expected to be in achieving their goals. The goals themselves are subjective, (different people have different goals), and are subjectively ranked, and so that subjectivity permeates the whole valuation process.

Not so. The powers of a successful 51% attacker are actually very limited, which is part of the reason that such an attack is very unlikely (given that using that hashing power to mine honestly is much more profitable). From the FAQ:




* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks

Of course its utility _to you_ may not justify its price _to you_ but notice that this isn an inherently subjective assessment. Claim that it's _too expensive_ in any broader scope and you end up in deep water quickly.


Sure. And two years ago it was close to unknown, and (possibly) extremely undervalued. Not clear what your point is here.

And the slave is alive today thanks to the food given to him by his master. Does the slave owe the master for that food? No. acceptance of the food does not oblige the slave to the 'master', because he is under duress, subject of threats of violence by the former (or by the state in service of the former).
Similarly George, a peaceful person, is subject to threats of violence by the state. So his use of the services that the state coercively monopolises doesn't endebt him to the aggressor in any way. First counterargument is rebutted.


The videos do not make this claim, so that's a strawman.
The difference that the second video explains is that taxation depends on threats of violence _against peaceful people_. On the propertarian libertarian view, peaceful means the non-violation of the property rights of another (this property includes, crucially, the  body of the person in question).


I believe that the farmer ought not to be punished (unless he's violating a contract) for using a minimum amount of force necessary to prevent the violation.
A question for you that relates to property. Person A has no friends, family and is not much liked by others. Persons B, C and D are dying of diseases. They could be saved if person A was killed and his organs harvested. Imagine that this is the only way to save B C and D. Imagine too that B C and D are all well liked, have families, help the poor etc. Does person A have the right not to be killed?

Thanks that's useful. To check I'm understanding this correctly:
A block is considered orphaned at the moment that it's discovered that it doesn't exist in the longest blockchain available (transactions in orphaned blocks are 'queued' again to be part of the next solved block, and are considered unconfirmed again).
Shorter block generation time would mean a bigger chance of forks developing in different parts of the network, because there would be less time for the network to propagate newly solved blocks (so a bigger chance that any given block gets more than one solution).
Greater likelihood of forks means that less trust can be placed on a transaction that's part of any given block, so with shorter block generation times, the number of confirmations needed to be able to place the same amount of trust in a transaction would be higher than it would be for longer block generation times.
Does this sound right?

As i understand it the supply of Bitcoins will continue to grow at approximately the same rate as it did before. That's because the difficulty of the solutions to blocks that miners have to find, scales in response to the network's aggregate hashing power, so that a block is solved roughly once every ten minutes. So the new processors won't result in a change in the supply of bitcoins (as in: the rate of inflation remains unaffected).
How the new processors (and news of the new processors) are likely to affect the demand for Bitcoins is trickier to predict. I'm guessing the effect will be positive to some degree--perhaps just because it represents more bitcoin related news items floating around the net, which will inevitably attract a few new users.

The government uses threats of violence to maintain its monopolistic control over: policing, law, legal tender money supply among other things. So yes, whether you like the idea of the state or not, there's no doubt that government certainly is a monopoly.

Agreed. Wallet, mining, and to a lesser extent private key are all unnecessarily confusing impediments to people wanting to understand how bitcoin works because they're very poor metaphors to describe what's actually going on.
Mining is a bad choice because it's possible to 'mine' even after it's known that no new BTC will be entering the system (ie. hashing for transaction fees after the last satoshi has been mined). So mining obviously makes no sense, and Bookkeeping is imo an improvement.
'Wallet' is bad because the defining characteristic of a real-world wallet is that it contains money. A bitcoin wallet does not contain money, this causes unnecessary confusion, not least of all because A bitcoin _address_ is a much closer analogue to a real-world wallet.

The exchange sites 'host' a wallet for you, where your bitcoins are stored while they're 'on' that site. The downside of this is that your continued access to those funds is dependent on the honesty and security of the exchange site. But you can transfer those bitcoins away to a self-maintained wallet too.

Not so fast.
Bitcoin grew out of ideas first published in the Cypherpunks list, of which Satoshi was very likely a member (given the sources cited in his paper). For instance Bitcoin is partially based on b-money, a proposal made by Wei Dai. Wei Dai had this to say about the sentiment motivating many on that list:
"in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary."
So to the extent that Satoshi shared the sentiments of Dai (I believe it's likely that they were shared to a large extent), it's not at all a stretch to say that tax evasion is part of the intended outcome of widespread Bitcoin adoption.
At least to claim otherwise, as you have done, is unjustified.

Cryptographic keys aren't much like physical keys, so forget that metaphor.
Each public key has a corresponding private key. The pair of them are called a key pair. The keys are long numbers that are mathematically related.
A user keeps the private key secret (secret key might even be a better name for it). And can broadcast the public key to the world.
The keys can be used to encrypt data. _Unlike real keys, the same key cannot be used to decrypt (unlock) data that it just encrypted (locked)_. Instead, the private key can decrypt data encrypted with the public key, and the public key can be used to decrypt data encrypted by the private key.
If someone wanted to get a confindential message to person X, they'd use person X's public key (perhaps it is published on Person Xs website) to encrypt the secret message before sending it. Because only person X has the private key, anyone intercepting that message wouldn't be able to decrypt it.
Keypairs can also be used to cryptographically 'sign' data. This is a way of guaranteeing that a given message originated with the owner of a private key. This can be useful when you want to rule out the possibility that the message was tampered with after it was sent, or to guarentee that the message really comes from the trusted person you think sent it.
The way this works: I write a message in plain text. Before i send that message I create a hash of the message (basically a one-way process that deterministically, but unpredictably creates a long string of seemingly rendom characters our of the source message--even a slight change in the message would give a very different hash result).
I encrypt the hash of the message with my private key. I send both the plain text message, and the encrypted hash of it in an email, or post it to a forum, or publish both pieces of data anywhere i want people to read it and be able to verify that I really wrote it.
Because the encryption of the hash was done using my private key, that means my public key (published on my website for instance), can be used to decrypt the encrypted hash. The plaintext message can then be hashed again by the person receiving/reading it, and the reader can verify that the new hash is the same as the hash that was encrypted with my private key.
This way, if they trust that I and only I, have access to my private key, they can also trust that any message i sign in this way really originates with me (and not some imposter).

I understand that. And for what it's worth I share your preference for minimising the influence of objects in my life. Nevertheless, even if everyone shared these preferences, it still would not be possible for us (as a society) to escape economic scarcity--since that will be with us as long as there are too few material resources to simultaneously satisfy all human wants.
Your desire to live long is relevant here for instance. Imagine that your life could be prolonged for a week by enlisting the services of the worlds top medical minds.

(Thinking aloud, semi-on-topic: With regard to initiatives like this, i was thinking it'd be great if there was a way that a thread author could do a kind of pledge bank thing, and say "I will email Kickstarter if at least 200 people pledge to do the same" (with full description of what the plan is). Then logged in reddit users could click a link to 'pledge'. And receive a PM if the required number of pledgers was met, at which point a large volume of emails would be sent all at once, likely causing bigger impact (perhaps even press attention for certain projects). Is this the kind of thing that could be developed as a reddit extension in chrome/firefox? Or a bot? Would be neat)

Do you think it's fair to characterise the purpose of this design decision as follows: To make it very unlikely that the originator of a given transaction would be the same miner who happened to solve the block that that transaction is contained within?
Am I right in thinking that if an actor could confidently expect to be 'the one' who solved a block containing a transaction he/she created, then it would be possible for him/her to cheat in certain ways?

Its not possible to know of an address is lost (the blockchain has no way of knowing if a person still has access to a given private key). But there is some protection against typos. Bitcoin addresses have a level of internal error checking meaning that many combinations of characters are illegal and will result in the transaction not being carried out.

Of course. The relevant question is whether the extent to which rich are more relatively powerful than the poor has increased or not since the collapse of the state in Somalia. Do you have any reason to believe this is the case?


No. It's far from that simple. Because in the presence of the state, the rich have access to tax funded means of compulsion, this can dramatically _increase_ their power--the state can multiply the power of the rich.

In the short term yes. In the long term it would lead to the emergence of solutions and assurances (extended by mining pool operators, to miners) far more robust than the use of forums to frantically beg miners to leave a pool--if anyone really believes that's necessary I'm puzzled at why they'd place any confidence in the long term viability of Bitcoin at all.

You can feel very secure about the technology that's actually part of the Bitcoin software--NB. this does not include 3rd party websites that use Bitcoin. You should feel a little paranoid about how you use that software though--there's plenty of opportunity for human error (lost/stolen/forgotten passwords, malware on your machine, keyloggers). Careful use of an offline wallet (eg. a paper wallet or brain wallet) removes most of this danger.

If the current decimal limit is maintained (ie. no units smaller than a satoshi), then there'll come a point when the last satoshi will be mined and no new bitcoin will enter the system after that.
But as I understand it, it's a possibility that the decimal limit be increased at some point in the future. Since the number of bitcoins asymptotically approaches 21 million, in principle (fractions of) bitcoins can go on being mined forever as long as the decimal limit keeps increasing to allow the increasingly small rewards.

The definition you offered said nothing about the degree of harm, merely that psychological harm, resulting from the deliberate use of 'power' (very vague), constituted violence.
I agree with you that these kinds of things are dramatically different to actual bodily harm/invasion, or the threat of the same. I think to widen the scope of the definition of violence in the way that the wikipedia article does is to do a grave injustice to the victims of what I'm going to call actual violence (including children), by trivialising the word.

Saving 10 bitcoins simply means not spending 10 bitcoins that you have. There is no 'picking them up'. There is only spending or not spending. Your wallet (which contains private keys) allows you to spend coins associated with the (public) addresses for those keys.

Zeitgeisters hate central banking. Bitcoin is interesting in that respect for obvious reasons. Zeitgeisters also want to abolish money, so bitcoin is antithetical to their desired end-goal.
My conversations with venus project advocates have revolved around the following points:
1. Money will probably be useful as long as economic scarcity exists.
2. Economic scarcity will exist as long as humans exist (even if it's felt less and less severely).
In my experience they understand point 1 but don't understand point 2, and don't have a solid foundational grasp of economic concepts to begin with (if they had, they wouldn't be advocates of central planning).

Sounds unlikely. My impression is that waging war is a bad investment (compared to other uses of those funds).

You're not talking about the creation of money here. That happens through mining. And is a task given to individual nodes.

The private sector was already heavily involved in research on getting computers to talk to each other. As I understand it, what the government did was to buy the rights to use a cluster of these ideas for military purposes—legally preventing others from developing them further (if anyone reading can confirm that this is/isn’t accurate, please let me know).
The US government bought the ARPANET project (the fledgling internet) for military purposes, and its research was directed in this direction too. The purpose of this intervention was certainly not so that (private) companies could ‘make money off the internet’.
Whether or not the government invented the internet depends on how we interpret the words ‘invented’ and ‘internet’—whose meanings can both be contested. **What we can be much more confident about is the much less ambiguous claim that government involvement severely delayed the arrival of the internet as we know it**.
It did this by buying the rights to an idea, by crowding out private research in this field (hiring the best and the brightest from the voluntary sector), and by forbidding the use of the internet for commercial purposes until the early nineties. After that restriction was lifted its growth rate exploded, and the internet finally entered the life of the ‘average joe’. More details on the history of the internet in [this wikipedia article](

That's interesting because to me the self equilibrating aspects of the order Friedman and Murphy describe are a big part of what makes their accounts so compelling.


This is pseudo science. Not compelling.
1. You have no way of knowing whether we have reached the nadir of the energy configurations yet, or how long such a process would take, when socio political patterns are the focus).
2. You don't know to what extent the lowest energy state--as regards socio political systems--_changes_ in response to influences including biological evolution, technological evolution, climate change etc. ie. To what extent it's a moving target.
3. Similar claims could have been made in the past, they would be just as unpersuasive: "If a non-slave-owning society were superior, if it represented a lower energy state then the existence of any slave-owning system would have to devolve inexorably into a superior non-slave-owning system, but it doesn't.".
