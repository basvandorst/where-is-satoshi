I appreciate the top posts level of sanity.
As much as people like to say "Yeah, but so is cash" when it comes to black market topics, there's absolutely no doubt that bitcoin makes large scale illegal transactions far easier for the "bad guys"
It makes sense that this would be looked into and it absolutely should be discussed openly and honestly.

I don't know what point you think you're making, but it's wrong I assure you.
Phrasing things like "We're giving every student $249.99 in the form of a 32" LCD TV" is not the reason 32" LCD TV's are not a 'primary currency'

See, the thing here is that it's not a negative attitude.  It is realistic.  His first point is addressing the cherry picking of successes from a data set mired with failures.  Do you know how much bullshit gets peddled on college campuses?  How many business get started and dissolved in the same fucking day at college?  The law of large numbers almost MANDATES that Facebook exists.
For every story you might find about success via wild optimism, there are a thousand more successes from the perspective of the ruthlessly realistic.  There are also a thousand more failures from wild optimism.
A sense of realism will always trump blind ambition.  But realism is often decried as hateful or overtly negative.  
What's worse is the level of negativity that comes from the anti-fiat, tax dodging, anarchistic 'libertarians' that pervade this subreddit.  People who literally doomsay the global economy and rail against the way the entire world works.  So there's a level of irony when I tune in to find comments that imply a tone of hippie dippy peace pipe smoking 'why you gotta be a negative nancy, deputy downer?' in response to relatively objective assertions.
Is reality killing your buzz, man?

Man, if you guys think this is fascinatingly easy, I should post a video of me purchasing shit on amazon with my debit card.  
It would fucking blow your minds.

Yeah yeah yeah, so were a ton of things that failed miserably and you have never heard of.  Go to college if you want to find out just how much bullshit exists in this world.  I promise you, everyone there has a million dollar idea.  They usually have a new one every single fucking day.
It's annoying.

Yeah why do people keep fucking adopting?  Mother fucking adopters, can't you see we're trying to STAY SMALL?
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:58:12
Well then why fucking try, right?  Why bother, let's just say "to hell with everything" and crawl in a hole and fucking die our miserable deaths.
Do you think they announce every time they stop something terrible from happening?  You don't hear about their successes.  Only their failures.  These people do such thankless jobs that I am fucking amazed they don't actually say "you know what?  fuck you guys, let's watch your reaction to what happens when we just STOP."

Manage your books better.  Most small business fail because of simple things like this.  If running a business was easy, most of them wouldn't fail - yet they do.

Candlestick charts are normal.

A lot of those are arguable, there are actually benefits to devaluation, and then the overall is that you would have to be recklessly devaluing to end up in a Weimar situation, which is really the word I have been waiting to see for a while now since all the tinfoil hatters jump on that train.
But I tell you what, let's watch Japan.  They're closer than anyone to the apocalypse if we hold onto devaluation doomsaying.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:28:35
I think you vastly misunderstand how fiat currencies are valued and I still don't understand how Bitcoin can magically fix everything.  We've already seen plenty of problems with it and it is the most volatile 'asset' I have ever invested in, which is fun to watch sometimes but realistically it signifies chaos (the exact opposite of stability).
EDIT:  Then again we're all walking around under the premise that things are bad and fiat currencies are bad, yet we send things form our iPhone.  Almost ironic.  "Things are bad, things are bad, - sent from my iPhone"
Income disparity has nothing to do with the nature of fiat currency, btw.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:10:21
How does a fiat currency like Bitcoin solve the problem of fiat currencies (accepting your premise)?
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:01:06
This, ladies and gentlemen, is a person without a college degree that has been educated solely on the internet.
This is why education SHOULD be the new bubble.  I seriously don't have the time to teach you, but I would heavily suggest you check into trade and capital flows, at the very least.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:23:16
You must be new to candlestick charts (and apparently trading entirely)

It's weird how we think of the devaluation of currency is bad.  How is that bad?  The bad part is that we make a smaller percentage of it so our purchasing power decreases - this isn't due to devaluation.
The devaluation of currency, if balanced properly which it currently is, is a non-issue.  It's held up as a major issue at the catastrophic level when the real issue everyone has relates to income disparity and purchasing power (wages and class issues, never mind that the standard of living now incorporates fucking cell phones and electricity).
Somehow the finger is continually pointed in the wrong direction, but don't worry Bitcoin will 'hold' its value so suddenly the playing field will be even?  
I read your posts over and over and what it ultimately comes down to isn't economics (quite the opposite, actually), it's some sort of idealism that I certainly can't fully comprehend.  Maybe because it's based on a faulty understanding of economics.
I additionally find it appalling that a bunch of neckbeard armchair economists think they have the solution for the global economy.  It's arrogance squared.  You fucking know-nothings.
Anyway, I'm bored.

Then how is the dollar fiat but bitcoin and gold aren't if they all derive their value the exact same way.
I'm just using your definition here.

I seriously don't understand why you guys use bitcoinity.  That site is a giant piece of shit.
Please educate yourselves on trading tools and use something like 
EDIT:  Geez sorry guys, I didn't realize you all work for bitcoinity - since that's the case how about making a site that's not a pile of shit
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:57:34
Fiat currencies are defined as legal tender, most often.  Colloquially it is just the phrase uttered to signify currencies issued by central banks.  So that just about covers everything.
If you're seriously going to be pedantic about it then you're in a different discussion altogether, and you're totally in with the crazy bunch.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:02:31
You are seriously arguing about nothing, that is one possible definition of fiat currency, mine is just as valid and in the grander context it doesn't even matter.
By the way, bitcoin is still fiat by your definition
EDIT:  I dunno who downvoted your post but I upvoted it to keep you at 1 at least, should keep conversations visible.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:15:14
This is where you go off the rails. 
The value of bitcoin is derived from the authority of the marketplace.  Gold is valued the same way and so is the dollar.  The difference with gold is that you can hold it in your hand and make shit out of it.  As a commodity it is very much fiat in how it is valued.
EDIT:  This is a key point that bares repeating, so allow me to repeat it.  Bitcoin is valued the exact same way as any other commodity or currency (with the exception of the Yuan and some small guys) - through the marketplace 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:45:28
I'm getting massively tired of the neo-libertarians on this site.  It's fucking infuriating to read rhetoric like "fiat is dying."  Such ignorant statements should be downvoted to oblivion.

Oh god with that hyperinflation shit.  At least you finally went there, I was really waiting for Weimar.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:45:36
Your entire post is meaningless.  If the market didn't want the dollar, it would be worth zero.  The market wants dollars and values them accordingly.
You're more into WHY the market wants what it wants, which is a who gives a fuck side conversation and only serves to detract from the overall point that bitcoin is no different.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:03:44
Isn't one of the reasons that BTC soared in value due to the implementation of BTC by Google in China?
Regardless, doesn't that significantly impact this?

You're not serious, are you?  Or perhaps you define "generation" in some strange way?

@_date: 2013-12-06 20:51:09
Yeah because bitcoin would allow for massive tax evasion.  
You can't see the average joe running a small business understanding bitcoin?  No shit, you know why?  Because the average small business owner just found out about NSF fees as if they were a foreign concept until just now.
This might shock most people, but the average small business owner is entirely incapable of fully running a small business by themselves.  You absolutely need accounting skills and a basic understanding of a wide variety of subjects - not just the industry your business is in.
