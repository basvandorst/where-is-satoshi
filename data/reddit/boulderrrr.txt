It's free as long as you conduct maker trades (as opposed to taker trades). This means you have to be on the bid and wait for someone to sell to you (if buying) or be on the ask and wait for someone to buy from you (if selling). If you buy at the market, you still get charged a fee, though it is still quite a bit less than the Coinbase fees. 
Hypothetical situation. BTC is quoted $17,500.00 X $17,500.01. In order to do a maker buy, you would have to put your order in at $17,500.00 (or lower) and wait for someone to sell to you. If you just go ahead and buy what is offered at $17,500.01, you'll get charged fees (about .25% I believe).

Thanks for your responses... Just trying to get my arms around whether there is a way to protect gains using the futures markets without the costs making it illogical. Sounds like the futures market is not as flexible as the options market where you can protect against substantial drops for relatively inexpensive premiums.

If buying from Amazon, choose one of the sellers that is listed on Ledger's website as a trusted retailer. I ordered one off Amazon yesterday being sold by Mintcell. I had initially placed an order on Amazon, but it was from a random third party seller so I cancelled the transaction. The Mintcell one was on Prime and less than $1 more.
Here is the link to the one on Amazon sold by Mintcell, though it appears to be on backorder now:

Let's say I deposited $X USD amount to Coinbase/GDAX and traded around for a bit between BTC, ETH and LTC. I wound up moving it all into BTC, so currently have a $0 USD balance in there. If I continue to hold my BTC through 2018, do I still calculate gains/losses from the trades I made for the 2017 taxes or can it all be carried through to next year?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:40:15
Anyone know where you can buy BTC put options? I've been looking around, but haven't found anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:16:18
Yeah, I was able to wire to GDAX same day with USAA.

People can't actually believe BTC is going "to the moon" without governments (especially the U.S.) introducing some form of regulation. I understand that a big point of BTC is that it is decentralized. However, there is no way large governments will sit idly by as BTC continues to exponentially grow. This is good for the future in my opinion. I'd much rather have SOME regulation than complete prohibition. The more this gets integrated into the current system, the better. I would be a lot more wary of my investment if the government was completely ignoring what's going on. The fact that they're allowing it and adapting can only be good at this point.

Looks like it's tomorrow: "CME Group will launch Bitcoin futures, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), on December 18, 2017, building off of the success of the BRR and demand for a regulated trading venue for the digital asset market." Source:

Does this mean you most likely don't need to pay taxes for 2017 if all your original funds remain in crypto, even if you traded between crypto types over the year?

The best argument I've seen against the idea that futures will allow for BTC accumulation followed by futures bets on a drop is that there is a counterparty to every futures trade. For every $1 bet on it falling, there is another $1 betting on it rising. Retail doesn't trade futures, so it's not like the sophisticated futures traders will be depending on the counterparty being your typical BTC retailer. 
In the case of an institutional trader accumulating a lot of BTC, betting on a drop in futures, then dumping the BTC to cause the drop, they can only sell as many BTC as they originally accumulated. The counterparty futures trader who is betting long can always buy up more BTC than the seller can offload.
I'm starting to think this current "dip" is good for the start of futures trading. Would there be more people willing to bet on a drop when BTC is at $19,000 or when it's at $13,000? I've noticed that the depth chart on GDAX looks wayyyy more symmetric since the giant pump to $19,500. Prior to that big rise, the buy side was way more heavily weighted. Now, they look pretty even. Not sure if this is part of the setup to allow for more structured trading going forward as futures begin. That rise to $19,500 happened because there was barely anything remaining on the sell side. The depth chart looks quite a bit more stable now. See what I mean in the posted image.

Yes, the writing is on the wall. $125M USD was used to buy $125M USDT. That money is now going to flow into crypto. You're right. It's clear as day.

Open a GDAX account. It is owned by Coinbase and allows trading and buying with no fees. You can transfer your BTC from Coinbase to GDAX instantly. For future purchases, you can deposit $USD into your account and purchase through GDAX with no fees and without paying an inflated price that goes along with Coinbase.

Hopefully you used GDAX to transfer to avoid the fees. I did two transfers yesterday from GDAX to my Ledger. The first one took 8 minutes and the second one took 12 minutes.

That would be buying the future at the current price though, right? Any idea what it would be if protecting against something like a 50% drop?

Yeah, I made my first transfers from GDAX to a Ledger last week and expected my transactions would take hours to days based on all the posts I've seen. The maximum wait time so far for me has been 12 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:15:47
Showstopper. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:45:53
Yeah, I'm wary of setting stop-losses anywhere, especially on BTC considering the deep dips followed by instant recovery and oftentimes, further gains.

I'm not saying block times are going faster. I'm saying that I experience a quicker transfer because the fee that GDAX assigns gives me more efficiency using segwit for that given fee than it did prior to them implementing segwit using the same fee.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:57:42
Well, doesn't segwit allow for fees to be less? Therefore, would the same fee using segwit vs. not using segwit result in a faster transaction time? Therefore, would GDAX's determined fee be quicker if it's the same fee using segwit vs. not?
