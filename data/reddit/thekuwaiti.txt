Run by a monarchy that makes sure its citizens have the best possible lifestyle including housing, schools, healthcare and no taxes. "Slave labour" are still sending money home to feed their families and are paid much better than the "slave children" making your $200 Nike shoes in China.

Reminds me Soug Al-Manakh story in Kuwait. Basically an unofficial stock market which was housed in an air-conditioned parking garage that had formerly been a camel trading venue, specialized in highly speculative and unregulated non-Kuwaiti companies. At its peak, its market capitalization was the third highest in the world, behind only the U.S. and Japan, and ahead of the U.K. and France. Bubble burst in 1982, same year I was born.
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:10:49

Im talking about the paper being thrown in the gif image. Not bitcoin ofcourse ;)
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:18:18
This is great news! A big step in the right direction to gaining mainstream usage in one of the countries that would benefit most from bitcoin. Most the population here (Kuwait, ME) are foreign workers (and a majority are from the Phillipines). They would benefit a great deal if it was feasible to send money back home with bitcoin. Best wishes.
@_date: 2014-03-26 07:46:34
The last time $10 million came in at once (few weeks ago) the market cap went up by $1.25 BILLION. Think about that ;D
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:07:18
That usually happens with blockchain.info announcements, lets hope SecondMarket can do better ;)

Im talking about ursury with fiat. There is no ursury with bitcoin since its a commodity
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:35:38
Ursury is not friendly with any of the major religions, we were warned since 2000 years it would get ugly in the end. God has blessed a few of us (early adopters) with bitcoin though ;)

Fascism involves an emphasis on ultranationalism, militarism, political violence and war. Have you seen any violence in Dubai? They are probably the most peaceful country in the GCC. They have a strong visionary as a leader and I respect him even as a person. I think what they have achieved by turning a desert ruin into the most modern city on Earth is something fantastic. I dont think there is anything wrong fundamentally with showing off your Lamborghini or wealth if you can afford it, thats what luxury is. They are proud of what they've achieved. I dont think the "citadel" that some early bitcoiners dream about will look a lot different, except maybe they will show off their Teslas instead ;)

China bans btc for 7th time so im guessing $499.99999
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:53:29
Their waiting for the "rules and regulations" to clear up so they can dive in? An example would be SecondMarket.

I think its better for each person to choose the wallet he likes but if bitcoin takes off manufacturers will probably have deals with wallet providers to include as standard. Time to talk to android/Google to include wallet software maybe?

@_date: 2014-03-25 07:36:53
1. The media has done enough of that already, but once the bitcoin infrastructure is ready and Wallstreet has bought in then the exact opposite will happen. I think in 2015-16 we will see bitcoin being hyped and advertised by the same media, only by that time they will be talking about mBit or satoshis ;)

@_date: 2014-03-24 20:31:31
These governments dont follow religion anymore, they just use it for propaganda and mind control when required. They worship the petrodollar. I think bitcoin is meant to save the masses, not governments, i just hope that people realize that and get in before its too late.
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:13:29
Yup. Thats the plan...
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:39:20
Im sure Apple requested that they post that specific headline ;)
