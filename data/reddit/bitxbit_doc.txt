Well ok. Thank you for your answer. I must admit to it leaving me with more questions.

I realize this is sarcasm but what the hell is a DAO?

Does anyone know how to get in touch with Max? I ordered one some time ago...

Well considering money in general as a technology first graduated from the rulers collection ledger to a mode to exchange fungible value for goods and services...starting with prostitutes. Everyone poops, everyone fucks, (or at least wants to). Still I appreciate your passion.

Appreciate your candor and concern. We were careful in our making of this film to avoid providing a platform for any misinformation or misunderstanding. As such even the more...let's say controversial figures... help to move the story along and provide a understandable perspective on the benifits of the emerging technology.

New Film premiering soon featuring all things Bitcoin and highlighting the potential that the Blockchain holds.

We can't wait to share it! It has been a long time coming, and we are very pleased to have put together an exciting and informative view of all we can accomplish with the Blockchain!!!

We like to think everyone in the film looks awesome and has a clear point to be made. Certainly no burn was intended.  There are a wealth of interesting and outspoken individuals among the greater bitcoin community and we urge everyone to judge the film not by a soundbite or single person, but as a complete and accurate representation of the blockchains potential.  
Allow me to be the first to welcome you to Reddit! Tis not what it used to be.
