Something to ponder: he's been flipping between 4th and 5th in Vegas betting odds, which have been much more accurate in predicting who gets elected than literslly anything else in the past.
Last time I checked it was Trump, Biden, Bernie, Yang, Warren.

Are you aware that just because you're countries VAT was poorly implemented that doesnt characterize all forms of a VAT?
Idk dude it's obvious you and I won't get anywhere with this conversation. So I wish you good luck with crypto and with life!

I researched vat enough to understand how it works, and yangs plan would only apply to the companies who are getting around our current tax system. Again, I recommend you checking out his website to learn more. And no, I dont know about carousel fraud but I will research it.
Edit: if I'm understanding it correctly, then Yang's vat plan will have little to worry about when it comes to carousel fraud. Check out the policy page on his website:

Yang's plan to deal with the immigration issue is actually a well though out, moderate opinion. Hos website has over 100 extremely detailed policy proposals on it including that. I'll have to go back and watch the first debate again to get context, but everything I've seen from yang is that he wants to create a pathway to citizen ship for illegal immigrants who are here and who are here working and trying to care for themselves and family and dealing in big criminal activity.
UBI is a weird issue because it sounds absolutely crazy. But Yang's reasoning for it is sound IMO, autonation is eating jobs up at a crazy rate, and it will continue to due so. If you ever get the chance and enjoy reading, I highly recommend checking out his book *The War on Normal People*.
And with his Vat plan, its solely to get tax money from big tech companies who are currently evading our taxes through legal loopholes. Amazon, netflix, and many other tech companies paid literally zero dollars to the federal government in 2018.
Shit really does sound crazy, I pretty much laughed out loud whenever I first heard yang's ideas on joe rogan's podcast. But by the end of it, I was just about on board. After going on Sunday special with ben shapiro, i was a full on yang supporter.

Dang yeah he dropped from when I last checked. Compared to the other top dem candidates idea I dont even know why people think the ubi and vat is that crazy

Nothing that says anything directly about carousel fraud, but extensive information on his VAT plan.

I would definitely take Yang's word over mine on what yang believes

Like is said, he has said in interviews who his vat will apply to. I'm tired homie if you really want answers, feel free to find them yourself
