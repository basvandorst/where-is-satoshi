I've lost too. I have since made everything back and then some. Those that truly lost are usually those with weak stomachs that pulled out at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:26:59
It uses bitcore, there are plenty of other *identical* block explorers out there, like the [trezor's one]( Just switch to that and let everyone else know.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:59:00


Ah yes, you must be another one of those that sees into the future. Ask people that bought before the last bubble how well it worked out for them.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:17:32


It won't kill bitpay because this is a completely different thing to what bitpay provides.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:24:02
See that's the problem. There are so many of these people but no one actually puts money behind their claims. Talk is cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:31:45
It's beeing worked on - that's why there's bcash, because it chose the easiest way to "fix" things. Core decided differently and contrary to popular belief quality code requires time. We'll get there, but if you're in a hurry you should switch to another fork that already dealt with this.
Reiterating the same things won't help, what you can do is donate so shit gets done and/or help test/write/review code. You can also push companies to start using segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:06:15
Whenever I paid with bitcoin I never had to wait (for any confirmations).
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:52:35
Well I just laugh everytime bitcoin comes up and change the subject, and if people don't shut up I just don't talk to them anymore. It has worked ok for me so far but it's still annoying.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:51:52


Rightly so. Korea has its shit together, it seems.

@_date: 2017-12-24 11:49:03


I had this same realization when it was $20. Then at $250. Then at $1350. I've been calling bitcoin a bubble since 2011.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:08:29
This is what FOMO does. The funny thing is that those early adopters who have made the most with bitcoin are the few ones that actually see the potential bitcoin has.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:52:07


This is incorrect. The fee from their wallet onward would be minimized, it does not change for anyone sending *to* a segwit address.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:25:26
Well he's right. Everywhere I turn people are talking about bitcoin and nothing else, and I'm kind of sick of it too.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:11:25
You can either have decentralized or you can have efficient - pick one. I'd rather have a trustless, centralized and efficient solution on top of the decentralized we currently have than none at all.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:48:03
So how much have you shorted? I'm sure you put your money where your mouth is.

Try eclair on android, works like a charm with starblocks and yalls. I tried the lightning labs desktop app and it never found a route, and now it won't even sync up anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:38:03
Lol, you literally could not be more wrong on any count. Please, do continue.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:26:31
Indeed. I think ln with bitpay using it (or any other payment processor like bitpay) would be a huge thing for user/merchant convenience.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:58:46
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:38:58
It doesn't. It locks bitcoins on the bitcoin chain and creates RSK tokens on the other chain (and vice-versa) - at least that's what it's supposed to do but it doesn't quite yet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:52:05
It's not even worth listening to him. Whoever says they know where this is going is just talking out of his ass.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:06:06
Yes, unless the transaction isn't actually broadcasted, like it wasn't in my case. The channel just disappeared from the list.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:19:31
Ah, envious, are you?
It was a point to show how stupid it is talking about percentages when it comes to the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:52:48
Where did I say anything hateful?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:29:23
That's because they still don't work 100% and you absolutely would lose coins. I've had at least two channels disappear from eclair without actually broadcasting the closing transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:42:53
Absolutely agree. I was telling everyone when price hit 20$ in 2011 that it was a bubble. Then when it hit 250$ a year later. Then at 1300$ in 2013. Now I have stopped saying it is a bubble - it has all the properties, but I really have no idea when or how it will burst.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:32:08
It won't happen because it's just a bunch of rumors and no confirmed source.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:34:25
I think the negative space is really hard to figure out, I only saw it after seeing the progression pic. If you make it thinner it would be a lot more obvious.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:42:11
It's not enough, that's why there's bcash for those in a hurry. Core is trying to fix it another way but contrary to popular belief quality development takes time.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:40:33
For those wondering 380 GB blocks require 5 ~~terabits~~ gigabits/second of bandwidth. Yes, he's full of shit.


talking about turing completeness is completely moot because bitcoin has very strict restrictions on the number of execution steps of bitcoin's script.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:51:28
No, it implies that transactions to their segwit address will somehow have less fee then what it had now without segwit - at least that's how I understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:32:26
You are correct, it needs ~~4~~ 3 transactions(one per each channel), but it sill needs 3 transaction even if this happens 1000 times.
for example, all transfers:
- A -&gt; B -&gt; C
- C -&gt; B -&gt; D
- A -&gt; B -&gt; D
would only require 3 on-chain settlement transactions, one for each channel pair (AB, BC, BD).
Take for instance a channel with BitPay - you could buy as many stuff from merchants using bitpay as you wish and it would all be settled with only 1 (2 with the funding transaction) transaction on chain.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:38:52
Let's not. Bitcoin is nowhere near ready for more exposure.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:23:29
You must still be in primary school, am i right? Some therapy for your anger issues wouldn't hurt, too - please, talk to your parents about it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:08:43


Then crypto is not for you, it's as simple as that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:55:48
Blocks are once every 10 minutes on average. If you were to continually download blocks every 10 minutes you need 5 ~~terabits~~ gigabits/second of bandwidth. I'm completely ignoring the orphan rate such a *low* bandwidth would have, so it is actually worse than that.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:43:18
Probably a smart decision.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:43:31
This is what happens when things become too big for their own good. Satoshi himself advised not to talk about bitcoin too much because it wasn't ready - and it still isn't. It will get there but quality development takes time.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:51:18


Exchanges changed their fees!? Where!?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:51:06
I'm not proposing adoption, I'm against it, because bitcoin is nowhere near ready for *even more* people.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:31:50
Me too. All batches (4 total) have been sold out btw.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:01:46
You seem to forget that the point of the show isn't to educate people about bitcoin. To me it was funny because I had two friends do the same thing with searching for some bitcoin I gave to them years ago - one of the forgot the password to the wallet and now can't get to the .15 he has.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:15:46
There are a bunch of people that got in in 2010 or 2011 that are sitting on several million $ worth of bitcoin, those are the one's I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:37:42
Internet strangers most likely don't know who you are. I'm perfectly happy to let everyone here know how much I own because I'm 100% sure nobody can figure out who I am.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:18:23
So what exactly is the problem? They didn't stop trading bitcoin, they just added bcash, as far as I can see. Or are you just hurt because it doesn't align with your ideology? Geez, people on this sub really have too gone nuts.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:44:03
Bitcoin works just as it always has, the fee market makes it work. For the high fees you can thank all the hype around bitcoin in the last couple of years.
It's going to get fixed but development takes time - if you're in a hurry use bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:54:14
Ah yes, those hairdressers, plumbers and supermarket clerks that are talking about bitcoin today surely are adopting it. (hint: they want to make a quick buck, that is all)
When threads like this need to be plastered everywhere all the time it's pretty likely it is indeed a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:17:20
It really is nowhere near ready.

I see you must be another one of those future-seeing folks.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:34:22


What are you talking about? I just transfered around 100k$ for 20$, or about 0.02% fee. Just because you paid 40% fee doesn't mean everyone does.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:04:52
Indeed, that was my poinit exactly. It's a (relatively) flat fee, for some it's expensive, for some it's cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:09:12


So I'm guessing you actually compute everything by hand?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:54:03


Actually, yes, you do. Try transferring money across borders and see what happens.
In any case this is what happens when technology gets too popular too quickly. Bitcoin is far from ready for the influx of users it got during the last year(s).

Every time around december I hear of some kid blowing one or both his hands off with illegally imported non-regulated fireworks. Just because he got lucky his stuff didn't cost a kid an arm doesn't mean he gets off scot free.

No. This is like saying "hey, we have apples but we also have all other kinds of fruit so aren't bananas also really apples". Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins no matter what, and whatever forks happen they are not bitcoin.

They can do whatever they want with their own fork but bitcoin will stay as it is.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:47:12


They *can* double spend but only coins *they* control. They can also *delete* any transaction in history if they choose so.

That is disappointing, I thought this was going to be the case from the beginning.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:51:42
Well bitcoin doesn't differentiate between local and global payments. It might not be the cheapest option for whatever you're trying to do, but it sure as hell is for some other stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:44:23
I have money ready to buy more if that happens. Bring it on!
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:27:42
I don't think so. There are a lot of things that are mainstream that people don't talk about at all. All this talk is just because it's so hyped and that's because people see it as a way to make a quick buck, nothing else. If things hopefully stabilize at some point people will stop talking about it and start using it more.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:16:44

Also because most of them are clueless about how bcash and their (new) difficulty adjustment works. With the new algorithm there's no threat even if bcash goes up.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:57:49


It's online. It does not mean blocks will have exactly 10 minutes in between, but the difficulty adjusts for every block now. Since hashrate still moves in bulk depending on profitability you can expect swings over a length of 1 day (144 blocks).
@_date: 2019-06-01 12:24:40
To a certain extent.

@_date: 2019-06-05 05:51:39
I tried paying with btc in bic camera and after the transaction went through all it said on their side was some kind of error. The clerk then happily showed me a new qr code for payment.

Ah yes, this technical analysis bullshit again. You see what you want to see.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:18:40


If it reduces the size of some transactions then there is more free space for others, even if those are exactly as they are now. I think the estimate is a 30% size reduction on average.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:04:23
me too!
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:56:28
My assumption is that this transaction is somehow invalid - it broadcasts but is discarded by nodes. Why not use [TransactionBuilder](
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:00:37
The new difficulty adjustment adjust every block on a 144 block moving average, meaning hashrate switches between chains about once per day and to a lot lesser extent - you can see [here]( peaks before new DA (oct 28., nov 11.) and after (the smaller peaks in nov). With this there's unlikely bitcoin will experience the reduced hashrate it had last time, and that's their main accusation down the drain.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:19:56

@_date: 2019-06-02 12:22:13
I trust the bank safe way more than I trust keeping the (full) seed in any part of my house, but not enough to have 100% of my btc exposed. I judged the risk and I'm fine with having the seed there, and if someone were to find it they would most likely get the bitcoins that are in the wallet that doesn't use the passphrase, so there's some plausible deniability, if i can put it like that. I also don't trust myself enough to memorize *anything* so I think my way of storing the seed is pretty solid.

@_date: 2017-11-18 19:55:14
Bcash did us a favor, with them using a new difficulty adjustment it should be a whole lot tougher to pull something like that again.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:55:06
Drops like this are good for the market, they get rid of weak hands that have no business being in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:02:22
Absolutely, some people will get burned and will most likely learn a valuable lesson. I don't think many people here are advocating putting more money than you're willing to lose in bitcoin. There's absolutely nothing we can do about it, you can't force people to not put money in it, so it's kind of a moot point.
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:47:53


Of course it's a bubble. That's how free markets work - it's a serious of bubbles, sometimes higher, sometimes lower, possibly with a long term up or down trend. Unfortunately there's no way to tell at which point of the bubble we're currently at.
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:35:45


I'll put this into terms where an attacker doesn't have control over the whole bitcoin mining infrastracture: if one check of a see takes 1 nanosecond (a very conservative estimate) and an attacker controls 1 million computers / cores it would still take them over 600 years to bruteforce it.

Just curious, what is supposed to happen when the difficulty adjusts?

[Bitfinex daily volume]( is $500 million. $20 million is a drop in the bucket.

No point in whining either - core's roadmap is and has been known for a long time. If you don't like it, leave.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:26:34
It does, and it's getting it, but posts like this contribute to nothing but more blame-throwing from both sides. Leave bitmain/bcash/roger ver accusations in the sub where it belongs - r/btc.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:52:50
Well I'm never trading during a high volume period so I have that going for me. I switched to kraken from bitstamp and I've been very happy ever since.
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:38:02
ah yes, exactly, passphrase, my bad. I have the passphrase written down on each half of the seed.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:45:33
It did when I put in the empty passphrase, but when I put an actual passphrase I was stuck with only m/44'.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:50:08
It's normal. When this happens all those pessimistic about bitcoin get loud, it's pretty logical.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:25:24
bcash, roger ver et al. You're just feeding the circlejerk.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:08:12
Ah. In that case it's probably because some people do not want to use segwit and this gives them a way to still use the ledger wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-01 07:11:14
I sure hope someone else besides you knows how to get it out if, god forbid, something were to happen to you that would cause loss of memory.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:21:03
To be fair I'm not planning on buying any more even if it corrects, I'm just *really* uncomfortable with the current price, because to me it feels like it did the last time before a big crash.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:58:19
Solution is pretty easy - don't rely on the prng and use a dice to generate your mnemonic.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:36:16
Sorry, I know you're not, I actually have you upvoted quite a lot, which means you obviously know what you're talking about, but theories like this make me indescribably angry :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:27:18
Use RES filters.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:31:36
Sorry buddy, I know it's your first post but there are tens of such posts per day and it's getting kind of ridiculous. We all know there are scammy individuals, but plastering reddit with this all day long certainly won't help.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:59:54
Bcash did us a huge favor here - with the new difficulty adjustments hashrate switching is a lot more frequent and done to a lesser extent.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:44:40
For example, because the merchant you're buying stuff from doesn't accept ltc.

I am saying they were very clear with what they think needs to be done in order to properly scale bitcoin. Like you said, it's open source so if you don't believe in their vision you can always make your own version - in the end the market decides what has value and what doesn't.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:36:28


It absolutely is. Just not for buying coffee.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:54:58

Nobody cares. You're only feeding the troll(s).
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:22:35
Ah yes, because bitcoin is all about making a profit and nothing else.
@_date: 2019-06-01 07:13:03
no, you literally pick the words you want out from the whole 24 word seed. Would be super cool if any hw wallet were to implement SSS though.
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:31:50
Just use whatever address you have in the receiving tab - most wallets default to creating new addresses for each transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:19:30
Lol no.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:53:27
You were most likely notified by your wallet that it will take a long time so I don't know what you expect.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:16:21
I'm talking about all posts about a "dip" being gone.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:43:28
You're the one saying it's a pump just because it rose quickly in a short time and whoever bought it is not a long term holder, without any proof.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:45:54
We'd all like it to be so, but unfortunately the adoption has outgrown the development. Satoshi himself warned against bitcoin getting too big too quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:34:37
In my opinion everyone preferring non-segwit to segwit addresses is doing so for political reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:06:38

Oh please. You sound just like r/btc with their conspiracy theories.


With bcash going up it's pretty obvious those pro-bcash are selling their btc for bcash. If 2x weren't canceled it would have been btc for b2x.

I would just export the private key to the addresses with bitcoins and sweep them into electrum.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:17:12
Bitcoin became too big way too quickly. Satoshi himself warned against this. This is what happens when development can't keep up with the influx of new people - it will take some time to catch up.
Also bitcoin hasn't changed. The algorithms are still the same as they were, everyone knew this would happen if bitcoin became too popular.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:43:34
I'm using a mobile app on android and still waiting to be *hacked*. :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:38:36
So you're saying the same applies to bitcoin, which is also a pump and dump in your view. Also what makes you think the whale who bought a bunch at once is only in it to flip them? You're making a whole lot of assumptions here.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:50:36
Would like to know this too. As far as I see you can only receive blocks but you can't actually broadcast transactions.

It was from a company that leases them in my country. From their webpage it looks like they're the re-seller here.
Even if tesla officially had nothing to do with it this was very bad publicity for them, because most people were complaining about the attitude. The amg-gtr with twice the price tag in the next room crawling with people over/inside of it wasn't helping them too.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:43:22
no, not worth it, just sell everything. Trust me, I'm an engineer.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:22:54
I never traded much but when I needed to sell kraken was my first choice, and still is.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:32:38
The question is poorly stated, for someone $10k is peanuts and for others it's their whole life savings. The results are completely irrelevant.

You can forget about encryption with hw wallets, and if you have access/have to do it using a computer why not use SSS instead.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:00:02
This is how I know most of people in bitcoin have no idea about investing. If you're not putting your money into something you're doing so for a reason, so there's really nothing to regret later on.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:17:30


There's literally no way to prevent hashrate moving between currencies with the same proof of work.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:03:57
I agree, what I miss the most though is the wallet not remembering anything but one - you have to connect the trezor every time you switch currency. Otherwise I'm fine with the way things are, at least you can't really transfer btc instead of bch by mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:55:22
What you're doing is stupid and obnoxious, not a "leg up". If you don't want to ruin relationships don't give investment advice.

@_date: 2017-11-02 15:26:36
One can't chose the 49' derivation path when using additional password on a trezor wallet, only 44' is an option. Probably a bug.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:33:13
I'm not active on r/btc so I'm mostly clueless about this but have exchanges actually agreed to switch to this new fork and abandon the current one? Because if they have not I see no reason for miners to not keep doing what they are. Unless trading on current bcash fork is **suspended** the same thing will keep happening.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:30:19
Let's be completely honest here, they're most likely right. Most ICO's have nothing to show for it apart from a nice looking website and a "whitepaper", but they still want millions of dollars.

There was a model x at a car show a few months ago and they wouldn't even let me get a closer look. From that point on I'm not even looking at teslas anymore. (I'm sure it was because the panel gaps are so ridiculous they had to keep people away so they wouldn't notice)
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:26:48
I'm not mad, but I think current prices are unsustainable. I'd rather have slow, steady growth than a series of bubbles.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:33:43
Let's not forget that all these tesla figures are still only unproven claims - with the $250k preorders this roadster is purely a means of keeping themselves above the water. There's no doubt in my mind that by 2020 when this is supposed to come out tesla will already be bankrupt.

what is *real buying*? You're saying some buys are more real than others? Let's say I have a lot of money and want to buy bch, I do it all at once and bch goes up by $200, why would that be a pump attempt? You're having double standards here.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:49:23

I see the potential of this a lot on this sub and it honestly makes me cringe, because I constantly forgot and/or lost passwords to stuff in the past.


absolutely, i can totally agree with this, as long as it's not the only "backup" a person has.
It's also pretty good to have a backup in such a way if, god forbid, you die or something happens where you can't remember stuff someone can clearly see that it's a btc backup when they have all components in their hands.

OP didn't ask for advice on what to do, he clearly asked for a way to cash out. He can make decisions for himself, he doesn't need your unwanted condescending advice.
It's actually really funny how people seem to be threatened by others completely cashing out of bitcoin, which is why these kind of comments always end up on posts like this.
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:06:24
Then you have a weak mind, and if you're prone to such a thing then you're going to regret whatever you sold regardless. If you decide to sell you're probably doing so for a reason, so there's no point in regretting anything afterwards.

Yeah it's a pretty common occurrence. I'd imagine they're doing it because people were spamming posts about bitcoin in the past and it got kinda annoying.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:46:17

Pretty much every part of the town has fiber but where I live, I guess I'm pretty unlucky. It's cheaper too than what I have right now - 20/20 would be about the same as my 10/0.8 ADSL, which is what I currently have because there's no better option.

Very likely. Hash rate moves to where it makes the most money, as long as there are competing chains with the same mining algorithm this will keep happening.
All this shows just how much we need off-chain transactions asap.

I think with limiting of the block size it's pretty much inevitable for bitcoin to be only viable for high(er) value transactions.

Sure, technically it should've been "you can pay with bitcoin here", which is how it's meant. I honestly don't see much difference.


Why do you think so? It would be exactly the same number of transactions (customer -&gt; bitpay -&gt; exchange or customer -&gt; store -&gt; exchange).

I mostly use 24 words so I can write them down, cut them in half and store in two separate places and still have enough entropy on either of those segments if one of them gets found. Otherwise 12 words is more than enough.
@_date: 2019-05-06 10:23:08
Most of the users "using" bitcoin are only in it to buy and sell and make a quick buck, not actually using it for what it was meant to be.


I think I understand bitcoin quite well, and I still don't think it'll ever become more popular than it already is. I'd love it if it did but realistically I'm certain it won't.
Last week I tried paying with bitcoin in bic camera and after the payment went through it just said error on their side. The clerk had absolutely no idea what was going on, so I was out of about 50$ because there was no point arguing. I don't see this getting any better in the future or, in fact, ever, because most people just aren't willing to put time and effort into understanding it.

Anyone with half a brain understands that isn't happening as long as bitcoin price is unstable - which is most likely never since bubbles will always happen in a free market.
Would it be much different if the merchant actually accepted bitcoins but sold them on their own the second they get them?

It's more or less a lottery. I'd suggest you make a few channels with well connected nodes. I only made one channel with eclair's node and when trying to pay for something elsewhere i had to try maybe 50 times before a route was actually found - judging from the logs most routes ended with some node being offline.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:26:18


How would that look any different if they keep the bitcoin in their own wallet to them using bitpay? It looks exactly the same for the user.


You can pay with bitcoin at starbucs, which is what they mean by "we accept bitcoin". They never said they hold bitcoins or have any contact with them directly.

They will follow the chain where their software works as-is - and that will be the legacy chain. This of course is my opinion of what I think is going to happen, or what I would have done had I run an exchange.

The clerk spoke no english and she clearly had no idea how bitcoin works. My japanese is pretty rusty as well, so it wasn't worth wasting half an hour for 20$.

A lot of people that invest are very emotional about it, and that makes them bad investors, because sooner or later they're going to make an irrational, emotional decision. You should set the limits at which you're going to sell before you buy anything, that way you keep emotions out of it and you have nothing to regret.
I sold some when the first bubble was peaking at about $20. I have never bought those back, but I don't regret it because I was happy with what I got at the time, so why would I regret it now.
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:44:12
I tried paying at bic camera a few weeks ago and it just said "error" on their side after the transaction went through. In the end I had to pay with yen and I never got the btc back. Luckily I was smart enough to do a test purchase with something small.

If there are actually miners on board with uasf it's going to split regardless when the first 'invalid' block is mined. I would argue that as long as major exchanges don't show support no sane miner would mine an actual segwit block.

This is very simplistic and in no way a mathematical proof. Also as far as I can tell none of the big exchanges (bitstamp, kraken, coinbase, etc.) have shown any support for the bip148.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:09:48
I know, that's what I'm saying, it's a big pain in the ass and you need to have a dedicated computer to keep it offline, bro. And then there's a question of how safe that computer is to someone getting physical access to it, etc. Well worth the 100$ if you ask me.
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:05:24
They might be slow with answering the tickets and their sight might be unresponsive a lot of the time but I've had by far the best experience with kraken of all exchanges I've tried.
@_date: 2019-05-31 11:58:44
I meant that even if an attacker would get hold of one segment there's still enough entropy left on the other segment that it's not feasible for them to try and bruteforce it. 80 bits of entropy is considered safe so a 12 word segment containing about 120 bits is more then secure enough.
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:03:52
thanks! pretty well hidden :)
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:41:09
If this is your reaction than you should probably let someone else do the investing for you. You make the best decision for yourself at the time. When you start putting emotions into the picture you start losing money.
I spent a lot more than one burger at $5, $12, $200, $1100 and probably some in between. I don't regret any of it because at the time it was the best decision for me.
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:57:18
So if miners continue mining block like they do now, why would the legacy chain reorg? The chains will split with the first block that is incompatible with the legacy chain, that is all, as I see it. After that there will be two distinct groups of miners mining on different chains.

If Bob has bitcoins locked in a ln channel then he *has* bitcoin on the main chain.


There's basically no security disadvantages. The only downside is that once he has bitcoins locked up he can't use them outside of the ln unless he closes the channel.
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:31:41
Were you happy with what you got at the time? If yes, then you have nothing to regret. This could've *easily* turn the other way around. Just set the limits when you're going to sell/buy beforehand and stick to that, don't make emotional decisions and you'll have nothing to regret.

I've tried that and I only got burned.

The [bip39]( has very little to do with the deterministic wallet and its keys, it only defines how entropy is encoded into a readable mnemonic. If you check the bip in the link you'll see that the mnemonic also includes a couple of bits of the entropy's sha256 (which is unfortunately a much too complicated algorithm to be done by hand). This is why generating a bip39 mnemonic by hand is out of the question.

Routing is still very problematic at the moment. The only reliable way is to make a channel directly with the one you're trying to pay to.
I had a similar experience trying to pay bitrefill through a channel with acinq, i literally had to try about 20 times (so about 200 tries, since eclair makes 10 tries per transaction) before the wallet was able to find a route.
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:37:55
