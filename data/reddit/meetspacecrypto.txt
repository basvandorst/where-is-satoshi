Or, take a look at something like Blackcoin or Vericoin, PoS coins that have already been mined out, and now confirm transactions through PoS, which generates actual interest in these coins in their respective wallets.

Also... We we list all locations that want to take part in this, and offer links to their sites, as well.
Since I have the *.meetspacecrypto.com name, another thought was to offer subdomains for individual MeetSpace locations, by area code.  Like, the North Alabama location would be   The Las Vegas... New Mexico (hah) location could be   That would be offered out to any locations wishing for individual, free webspace of their own.

You're completely missing the point.  


I already have.  It allowed me to quit my job.  If you think asking a few miners in forums "Is mining profitable?" is going to give you straight answers... then go ask the oil barons in TX if you can go drill for oil there.  They'll probably tell you the same thing... "Oh... there's no money in drilling, anymore... no oil profits left."   I'm not trying to make a million $ off of selling equipment, either.  I'm trying to do the desperately needed service of getting mining out of big money's hands.
Let me ask you... If I sold a Cointerra TerraMiner IV for $500... how is that a disservice?  I've already made my ROI.. PLUS some.. from the initial $6500 I paid for it back in November.  If someone buys it for $500, they'll make that back in about a week with the same hardware.  That's honestly "paying it forward" with hardware.  
And yes... they can buy these machines online.  Usually, the 2 things I hear, though, are
* It's a lot of $$.
* You'll have to wait
There are some companies who have caught up with their pre-orders.  But, would the "hobbiest" (not looking to make millions, mind you... but just interested in mining) had the option of buying a TerraMiner for $3,999 from Cointerra, and hope it ships at a reasonable time... or take a look at the same rig, running that day, and be able to walk out with it for $500-$1000?
But it's a disservice.

I am a one-man show, at this point.  I had this idea and went with it, a la "Field of Dreams".  If you have some suggestions, or know some graphic artists that would be willing to help out a lonely dreamer on getting this concept off the ground and running, it would be greatly appreciated!  =)
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:51:55
This is part of the initial concept, on the site.  I'd like my store, personally, to have several POS systems there, so that local business owners could come by and see them in use.  We could even host a monthly meet up of interested business owners, after hours, to demonstrate and show how easy it would be to integrate.
Of course, my professional IT background makes me leery of becoming a help desk for local business support... but my soft side would always help someone out if they were hitting me up with Bitcoin questions.

Now you're comparing a pure exchange to a company that offers ACH transfers and payments, and also offers a lot of tools for merchants.  The two are more different than you seem to gather.

Also, there are a few coin exchange pairs on cex.io, NMC-BTC, LTC-BTC, and a few others.  They charge a fee per trade, too... so there's a little residual income there, too

I'm only asking a 1% Franchise Fee for any name/likeness use.  Please, compare that to other franchises before making a comment.  I own the domain, and don't want anything sold online under that moniker.  However, with more involvement and franchise owners with say-so... we can always improve the image and layout.

I wouldn't mind opening a location in ATL, either.  =)
Heck, that's just a 4 hour drive, so I could manage both.
@_date: 2014-06-09 05:59:46
Well... just about all other alt-coins are still based off of or are using "bitcoind"... and Proof of Stake is just another way of verification on the network.
My big thing is, if OP is looking for a coin to earn interest, there are options.  However, my "method" still relies on either of those two coins continuing to trade against BTC.

Gotcha.  This is an "evolves as it goes" presentation/pitch... and the last thing I want to do is come across all "Nigerian Prince"!  =)
I'm working on a more precise explanation of the business model in a YouTube video/presentation, so I can have that up once I get the kickstarter/bitcoinstarter kick-offs going.  There's just so much to do, and so little time!

I don't think you are.  My Cointerra machines paid themselves off, already... and they were the "slightly under-performing" 1.6 TH models.  Have you done any homework on Spondoolies?  Or run the numbers with some of the Zeus miner setups?  sCrypt mining is going to explode, this summer.

I thought about doing a slider in the center section... but with no "in store pics" or anything other than stock imagery of paper-wallets online, I figured the logo was it, for now.  But I appreciate constructive criticism, and will be hitting up soon for a "website makeover".  =)

THAT's more of what I'm talking about by "franchise concept"!  Thank you for posting this!!
I'd love for the "MeetSpace Crypto" concept to take off, and we'll offer collective support and media presence to anyone sticking with the name... but the model itself will be pretty repeatable by anyone.  I hope more folks get crypto out to brick and mortar locations!
My wife and lawyer yell at me everytime I bring it up... but at some point, once all of the numbers are tightened and "sound"... I really like the idea of making this the first "open source franchise".  Where, in an effort to spread crypto-currency use and availability... we publish all of the models and charts/data to run a successful location online, and let people grab the logos and already-made marketing and go at it, themselves.
@_date: 2014-06-01 01:54:33
It's paid off, made some more, I'll make more off it on a sale, and could reinvest in the 2 TH version, or buy up a scrypt miner.  If *you* don't want to do it, I'm not telling you to.  But, there is a formula that works.
And thank you for taking my hypothetical examples for price point as cold hard fact.  In fact, I was going to sell the first 2 TM IV's in-house for around $1000 when we open.  But, if I need to drop them to $500 to prove a point on the internet.... no, wait... THAT's bad business advice.
Petty arguments aside, what all mining needs is a more robust user base, or Bitcoin and other cryptos will end up painting themselves in a corner, simply by a screaming that it's a "decentralized currency" when all of the transaction processing is done by big $$.  
We're at a point in the game where more folks needs access to equipment, if they are interested in the slightest.  If foregoing massive returns in favor of putting mining equipment in more peoples hands sounds like a bad idea for this currency we're all excited about... then maybe I am talking to the wrong people.
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:59:34
I'm glad somebody got that!
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:56:03
Oh yeah.... I'm not looking to make millions of $ off of this.  The point is that crypto-currency is at a real turning point, right now.  I'm looking at this as a chance to increase visibility of cryptos, and offer are pretty neat opportunity for folks who are also excited about crypto-currency.  But, just like any other franchise or new business... there are no gurantees.
I just know that there is a way to not only keep up with the "mining arms race"... but this is a chance to help decentralize mining, too.  ALL crypto-currencies... Bitcoin, scrypt, even x11 and others (because their basis off Bitcoin, and the use of the block chain) will benefit.
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:11:16
I will add you to my list of contacts, Moose... it seems like Canada is way more open to crypto adoption at this point, than businesses here in the states.
That's the overall feel of the "MeetSpace" part of this venture, is the "crypto-cafe approach" that seems to be a better buzzword here on reddit.  That's, basically, what the in-person transactions and meetup part of the locations would be for.
However, a business needs revenue to function.  We can't sell Bitcoin, outright, here in the states... without getting into some fun with FINCEN and banking/"money transfer/loan" business laws.  I'd fall under the same categories as the exchanges.
By selling ASIC hardware, we fall under "computer hardware / reseller" laws and taxes.
I really have laughed a lot.... over the past 6-8 months... as I've watched a whole lot of people read "mining's not profitable", somewhere, and go on and spread it like the gospel without ever running numbers for themselves.  There is a set cost that you can enter the game with, at any point, and still make a return that covers all of your overhead costs and builds a business.  
The concept and idea, here, was not just to open a cafe and chat about crypto.  This will be a repeatable business model that will help distribute and decentralize mining, and put smiling, excited folks that are enthusiastic about the concepts of a digital currency out into "Meat Space".
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:35:33
I think x11 is GREAT!  Mainly, because I live in Alabama, and the summers get HOT around here.  I like x11 GPU temps WAY better than scrypt GPU temps!  Plus, I like the idea of ASIC-resistant cryptos.
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:01:24


Tell me, please.  What do you know about mining?  
What is the projected return of a 54 MH/s Zeus scrypt miner over the course of the next 18  months?  Or a _insert another brand here_ package on SHA-256?  Do you know what an expected hashrate should be to cover the operating expenses of a "cyber-cafe" / "bitcoin friendly business" (rent, payroll, etc... the costs of opening and maintaining a location)?
That's proprietary information.  You can dig around and figure it out if you want to.  I've already done the math and homework.  
I'm not offering a directory of services.  Anyone who wants to take out a business loan, because they've always wanted to work for themselves, now has another model to replicate for expected results.  
@_date: 2014-05-31 04:16:49
That's kind of what I was aiming for.  We'd just have a cctv system so folks could feel like they have a "safe area" to meet up for LocalBitcoins.com and in-person transactions.
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:40:57
I am looking at existing retail spaces, right now.  Malls with a lot of foot-traffic, especially.
I can sell Bitcoin, outright, as a person.  In the US, the IRS recently decided to treat Bitcoin as "property".  It is subject to capital gains, and I have to note the "mined/bought" price, and the "sold/bought-something-with-it" price.  It's very confusing, and could be more for a store owner, and how that would work into a small business's books.  I'm trying to make this as easy as possible for new business owners.
On the other hand... as a "franchise owner"... I am my own boss.  I am, also, an individual.  So, Even though MeetSpace Crypto does not buy/sell/exchange BTC and other alts....as a business... I can do that as an individual.  Even if the people I'm transacting with happen to be in my franchise at the time of transaction.

Purchase your $200 dollars worth of BTC, which would be about 0.3097 BTC.  Place that in a cold-storage or offline wallet.
Then, you can just occasionally check [Preev]( for what 0.3097 is equal to in dollars or several other currencies.
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:09:07
In a sense, yes... a similar layout is what I'm looking at.  We don't have anything like that in this area of the country.  I'm curious, though... how is the Bitcoin Decentral funded?  Is it by the start-ups?
Ideally, I'd like to offer enough space to hold weekly meetups and business demonstrations for local business owners.  It's just that instead of startups and their projects funding the space, the mining/reselling would fund it.

All MeetSpace Crypto locations will host a local p2pool node, in an effort to help decentralize mining.

Retail franchise opportunity.  Crypto-cafe concept looks to spread crypto information in small towns across America (eventually, around the world).  Each location will be fully funded by mining and mining equipment sales to help maintain a decentralized mining network.

I have consistently mined between .13 - .14 BTC a day with 2x 1.6 TH/s TerraMiners on both GHash.io and Eligius.  Although Eligius's payout system is slow, it's always fair, and I've never felt "shorted".
If you're seeing that big of a difference in mining profits from two different pools, then there is something wrong with your config/connection.
In fact... since February, I have mined BTC Guild, Eligius, GHash, and Discuss Fish.  I have never seen more than a .02 BTC difference (per day) in any of these pools.

Your assuming that "profitable" just means that someone is making an ass-ton of money off of mining.
"Profitable" and "Not profitable" become different concepts if the Bitcoin network's hashrate is centralized into the power players and big spenders.  If I can get more people into mining, and the price of bitcoin maintains or goes up... it's great for everyone.  The "All ships rise"-concept.  I'll be selling equipment for way cheaper that will allow more people into the market.  Hell... I could sell my Cointerra Terraminers for $1, right now, and they'd still  be "profitable".  I've already mined their ROI, and by selling them to someone for $500, even... someone would be excited to buy them at that pricepoint, and I've further decentralized the network.  Plus, I now have more money to grab the next hot mining item, test it, mine with it, and then offer it dirt-cheap to another hobbiest.
If mining continues to stay centralized into the big money... bitcoin, itself, will lose it's grip on the beauty and efficiency of it's decentralized network.  THAT would be my idea of "not profitable".
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:22:09
I am trying my hardest, right now, to get MeetSpace Crypto off the ground.  We want to sell ASIC hardware at a massive discount to miners via our future retail outlet(s) that will help keep ASICs out of "only the big spenders".  We're also going to implement local p2pools on-site.  Between Business-class connections, and faster pings to local MeetSpace Crypto locations... we can try and help with some of these issues.
There's no point in gushing over a "decentralized currency", when the processing network is becoming more centralized.  Hopefully, by getting a few more folks into mining, by cutting prices on ASIC hardware... we can help.
