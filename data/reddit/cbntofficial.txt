The design is horrible, but anyone used?

People hodling coins is a good thing. This means they are taken out of circulating supply and the price will increase.

Yeah, that's the trend.

Is this a bull trap?

What a lot of people don't realize is that Bitcoin has had 3 major bubbles before this. Imagine buying at $100 to see it fly to $1000 to fall back down to $100 again? Imagine some people lost 90% of their money when bitcoin fell from $1k to $100. Then a few years later it surpassed $1K and went up to $20K. We are going through something similar now. I see the markets recovering next year and maybe another year to hit another bubble ($20K+) in which case we all ride our lambos into the sunset.

This is actually old news. The two things that are banned in China are on-shore exchanges and ICOs. It is also contradictory because most off-shore exchanges' websites are blocked.

Seeing how we are at the bottom of a prolong 11-month bear market, I would recommend HODLING it. Unless you need to the money for something important, then you can sell some.

Didn't he also attempt to hire hitman? She forgot to mention that.

We are almost there. Most other major coins have came off 90% this year. People have been selling alts for BTC as a safe have. BTC is finally getting to that range where the markets can finally recover again.

It's cool, hope more shops can accept crypto payment.
Think it's interesting to pay instead of a stable coin, or fiat.

People love to quote Warren Buffet Saying " Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful".  But when the time comes, no one seems to follow the advice.

This is kind of funny. As far as investments go, you should have been telling people to avoid this speculative bubble about to go through the roof. Now is actually the time to tell people to buy when things are going to rock bottom prices.
