Really? What's the rate at now?

Id love to learn more about your specific farm and business! This shit makes me excited. So much that last year I started buying what I could afford (small amounts)  of stock in solar/wind farming. 
Know any good vertical farming that can be invested in by the average person?

Just wondering if it will go back to around 75$ mark. I've been hanging around BTC for a while now (lost a wallet with 5coins a year ago when I thought it was shit).
Do I gamble and take the risk now, or just wait? How big would a drop be? Would it be worth it?

They finally responded after 4 hours. Thanks, though. I probably won't be using them again unless I really need to.

Decided to purchase 37CAD worth now, and closely watch the market for the next few days/week waiting for a drop, sink a little more, then repeat.

...what the hell is tdoi?
I've been waiting 2 hours for someone I expected would take, as the site and friends stated, would be minutes.

I solved the issue! I had to remove all armory files... I was apparently missing some, and then reinstall.

As a non european, yes I would because I don't know the rate.
If the rate didn't fluctuate so wildly it wouldn't be an issue. I'm Canadian, and I don't bother to look at the CAD to USD conversion rates, because I know they are close to $1 of each other. If Bitcoin stabilizes where you'd be able to not have to notice that much, then sure, we can talk in btc.
Until then, I'm not going to offer someone .2btc without checking the exchange rate to the currency, so I can make a **fair purchase on my behalf**. I'm not paying 50$ extra for something just because I was negligent on the exchanges and how much it is worth.
That's like asking me to blindly pay someone in euros when I first have to turn it from CAD without looking at the rate.

Installing that didn't change anything :( Still showing zero balance.

You just gave me a good idea ---&gt; Invest *some of the money and save some for potential drops.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:31:43
And then you still run the risk of insane flips. That's the only thing putting me off from not checking all the time, is the flips. Once it **does** settle down, I'll be more comfortable with it.
