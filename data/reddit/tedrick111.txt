Wrong. Run a simulation of a bunch of stock traders buying and then selling only if the price is higher. See which direction the price goes.

1. Why are we giving the "Bitcoin Foundation" any credit? Is this not a decentralized currency?
2. Bitcoin got its credibiility directly from Silk Road. Nothing good ever came from Silk Road *except* bitcoin.

I'm confused - In order for the transaction to be easy, you need to have a coinbase account?
I didn't buy anything. Most of the stuff they have costs more BTC than I'll probably ever have, but I'm glad to see some adoption.

You're building a minefield of de-anonymized addresses... I'm going to have to mull this over, but I think you're alienating Bitcoin's core-constituency (the people who kept the value at $550 last crash instead of 0).
**Edit:** Re-read it later in the day. Makes sense as long as the address is the only identifying data. I'd endorse this brilliant technique.
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:51:52
I see where you're coming from. I'm (perhaps unrealistically, we'll see) guessing that we're a couple more US financial crises from people running from the dollar.
Also, if the price went up in to the thousands, it lends credibility to the stuff you mentioned, and I think would act as a catalyst.

Please don't fuck up Bitcoin for me by not understanding this incredibly simple concept.
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:23:43
I think this is pretty basic stuff...
**Raises the price:**
1. Holding and/or buying.
2. Selling higher than you bought for.
3. Becoming a vendor that accepts bitcoin
**Lowers the price:**
1. Theft of bitcoins followed by fencing (e.g. mt gox)
2. Selling lower than you bought in (a.k.a. panic selling)
3. Mining and selling coins cheaper than the market rate.
Did I miss anything? Oh yeah, shut up about dogecoins. It's not gonna happen.

Currently, I agree. However, during the more and more common times of uncertainty in the dollar: frequent fiscal cliffs government shutdowns, debt ceiling increase...

It's working out awesome: Every single bitcoin scam is predictable and preventable by individuals. Some individuals just happen to care more than others. Go back to paying on your college debts so that some day you can afford to go in to debt and buy a house. There's nothing here for you.

Investor trust? Investors don't work that way. The investors backing Coinbase, for example, signed a contract with Coinbase for money in return for a stake in the company. I think you mean naive daytrader trust, which was clearly too high in the first place.

Spookybanana answered the question, but I'd like to take the opportunity to paint a picture for you:
Say you wake up and find yourself in a country on the other side of the planet, in a country you don't even know the language of. You have absolutely nothing on you except your clothes. This country has widely adopted bitcoin.
A while back, you had put some bitcoins in a wallet, encrypted the wallet, and dropped copies on a USB drive, your laptop, your phone, and a dropbox online.
If you can make your way to a computer or smart phone somewhere in this country, you can retrieve your wallet from Dropbox and start spending bitcoins there.
Sorry if that's too hypothetical and does nothing for you. Aside from waking up in a foreign country, the rest is a pretty realistic scenario *today*. I just think it's cool.
It's like having a mattress stuffed with cash anywhere there's an Internet connection.

This is a landmark court case in the making.
Can't wait until people start putting copyrighted content in to the block chain. If a cease-and-desist went to court, I'm pretty confident that a judge would throw it out, but think of the implication: This isn't just a file share, it's an entire purpose built network that necessarily propogates other information, for better or worse. Either Hollywood would get its way, or "intellectual property" just became a thing of the past.
Imagine running bitcoin, extracting certain blocks, and assembling their content in to Pulp Fiction.

1995, 2011, **2013**: Debt Ceiling crises  
1995, 1996, **2013**: Government shutdowns
These are all events that were unprecented before they happened. As someone with an opposing view, I have a feeling you'll write off the culmination of all three of these events in 2013 as consequences of their respective parent causes, with no consideration their shared root cause. If that's the case, save your keystrokes.

You'd spend what you needed to and hold off on what you didn't, then your kids wouldn't have to work as hard as you. To elaborate: People would only work when other people were willing to spend deflationary dollars, so the army of people sit and cubicles and do nothing 90% of the time would be forced to switch to a model where they were paid more for the little stuff they actually did, and that payment would be carefully measured based on performance instead of shoveled in without question. Go to an average office building: It's mostly magical fairy bucks that drive the economy *right now*.
I get that there would be a painful period where society completely relearned how to walk, but really, does it sound so absurd? Even if it does, the cat is out of the bag. Might as well start crawling now.
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:00:43
You're not an idiot. I think your point has some validity, but I don't know whether you realize the big difference: Bitpay and Coinbase can't print up more bitcoins when they need to finance some big imperial project.
Of course, I'll probably get downvoted for my tone around here. Bitcoin is flourishing. The bitcoin subreddit, on the other hand, is starting to look like a propaganda site where people need to fucking read reddiquette.

Wrong. Say bitcoin is accepted everywhere, and then an unpatchable exploit is found. What drove the price to zero? It wasn't the utility. They're trading at over $500 right now. It's not the utility. It's the confidence that it will eventually have utility.

1. *Takes advantage of Bitcoin's open-source nature* and are essentially clones of the codebase that have been tweaked for novelty
2. Manifested *after* bitcoin had already carved a niche that started looking like the Grand Canyon, and are blatantly get-rich schemes by their respective creators.
3. Was viral marketed as a joke. If you own DOGEcoin, you are part of the joke. I know some investors who literally in it because "people are stupid".
I'd rather come off as elitist or whatever and not be among the people-of-walmart cryptocurrency that needed to exist and then to fail in order for bitcoin to continue doing what it does best.
When your dogecoins fail, I hope it doesn't affect your trust of that which created trust in a vaccuum years before market manipulators took advantage of you.

Bitcoin is not a stock. It's acting like one because a bunch of people are treating it like one. If they stop, the games people play with stocks will stop.
I don't hold large amounts of funds in any exchange because that's not what Bitcoin is for! It didn't take Gox to teach me that peer-to-peer open source currency was not intended to be left in someone else's wallet any longer than necessary. That's the clue. Regulation is not.
What we have with dollars is other people being trusted to look out for our interests. Fuck that. I got burned in the housing market, I'm going to get burned in the social security market, and I'm sick of watching this huge overbearing system leak a bunch of money despite paying a bunch of people a bunch of money to put a stop to it. Dollars are bullshit we were born in to. Bitcoin lets people make their own mistakes and learn from them. Think of losses as saving money on a formal economics education.

I don't think our bank-bashing friends here are critical of the services banks should honestly provide. I think they're critical of:
* Obfuscation of cash-flow to the point where there's no accountability, regardless of what laws are written on paper
* Fractional-reserve banking practices, which can only exist under a fiat system.
* The whole notion of a debt-based economy.
Just my two cents.

I can make (yet another) coinbase recommendation.
In my opinion, now is probably a fairly neutral time to buy. I think the valuation seems pretty stable, but a single piece of news (good or bad) has been known to knock it around by $150, sometimes. You get used to that fast :)

I'm the most paranoid person you're going to hear from today. You've already screwed up: Your wallet has been written, unencrypted, to disk once. That means that even if you delete that file, it's still recoverable on whatever medium you wrote it to. The balance could just disappear one day because someone found your old drive in the trash!
Make a new wallet directly in to a 5MB truecrypt mounted volume. 5MB because this is going to be useful enough that you might use it for other super-private info. Make the truecrypt volume password something well above 30 characters, and unguessable. If there's some sequence that isn't from pop culture that you recall from childhood, it's probably a great seed to come up with your password. Use **this** wallet as your vault. Distribute the encrypted vault file to a USB key, email it to 50 of your closest friends, make 6 copies. Only decrypt it when you need to transfer small amounts to a different wallet, which you'd use for day-to-day transactions. The second wallet will double as a litmus test to see if the system has malware (if you lose whatever BTC is in wallet B). If you have a droid phone, your second wallet could just be the Android bitcoin app.
If you're good at scripting, one idea would be to mount the truecrypt volume overtop of your unencrypted .bitcoin directory, so you can just kill the bitcoin-qt client, de/encrypt the volume (whichever applies) and start the client back up. Voila! One client, two wallets with different purposes.

So would the buyer use bitcoin and the seller get dollars, or vice-versa?
Ebay really only needs to verify that the transaction happened. I don't see how Paypal would enter in to the equation. Seller provides a receive address, Ebay confirms that the correct amount went to it...

I believe luck can get you born in to the right place. Beyond that, your example of 99 people respecting the rights of the "winner" is a joke, and here's why: Let's say all 100 people had to do was store up nuts for the winter. One doesn't because he's lazy. Are the other 99 obligated to feed his lazy ass all winter? Is he going to enforce that obligation? I don't expect an answer because this scenario is just as ridiculous as the one you came up with.
If you think luck is a major factor (of course it is a factor, I think we disagree on the degree), then I'd suggest you quit with the superstition and go look up what an actuary does for a living. Your world-view has no treads.

You're completely not factoring in the element of trust. If you knew bitcoin's early adopters waited 5-6 years to find out that cryptos have a 5 year life cycle (which would speed up now that there are "experts" all over the globe), what's the incentive to put faith in to another crypto that is essentially virtual dollars? At that point, they've lost their luster and it would be apparent that they are all pyramid schemes because they have a predictable life cycle.
Certain things have to be true in order for alt currencies to be worth something. One of those is that if bitcoin fails, it has to be because of some flaw that another crypto has found and fixed. I think this "detail" is more important than you think.
A failure of bitcoin due to social factors means that every damn one of them is just a fad, and will go the way of geocities, myspace, and facebook in the future. Mine doge, spend it, whatever, but if bitcoin is abandoned because its early adopters took what was at the time a huge risk and it risk that paid off, I think we've established what cryptos are really worth right there.
The entire foundation that gave bitcoin a trace of value is that can't be affected by social factors. It's supposed to be a truly neutral currency.

The problem with making this DNS-like is that the long address is actually the root of all trust. When someone pastes you an address, you're physically looking at the undeniable evidence that they are who you want to deal with. As soon as you abstract that in any way, you've just opened the pandora's box right back to the beginning of the last 20 years of web evolution. The Bitcoin client gives you a name field to use for common addresses. I'd just stick to that.

If Bitcoin fails, all these other cryptos, which are essentially copycat get-rich schemes, must at the very least fail for the same hypothetical reason. You'd have to wipe the memories of everyone on earth or at least wait a generation for another attempt to even occur.

There are still many "whales" who are unloading at the arbitrary $1000 price point (betting it won't go up).

I **was** the person you're describing about 4 months ago.
I'm going to cite somethings that became true as soon as I bought in, and were never true in the history of mankind before: I can go anywhere on the planet, and still get access to universal money that nobody can take from me or devalue, etc. I can pass through a security checkpoint and they can't confiscate it or arrest me because I'm carrying too much. A court can't track it, much less garnish it, a mugger can't steal it. The US Government can't start a war or bail a bank out by printing trillions of bitcoin and double the price of milk and eggs over ten years.
If you follow some easy-to-learn precautions, it's a nomad's dream, come true. We're all nomads, to some degree. Maybe I don't even have any bitcoin at all. How would you know? From your perspective, I'm just a guy with basic computer skills with no money on me.

Well, if you're just looking at the situation that one shallow way, I can see why you'd make that mistake. Food and gasoline have doubled in cost-per-dollar in the past 15 years. What has bitcoin done in the last 5?
You're taking a big gamble either way. The only difference is that you'd be aware of what you lost (or gained) if using bitcoin long-term.
For some of us, the value of bitcoins extends much farther than the complexity of a single transaction (apparently as far into this as you've thought).

Someone downvoted you but I think this is the most reasonable approach. You're not going to get the whole community to switch in one shot.
A separate PR campaign for mBTC or whatever would separate them in a discussion the same way that talking about trillions of dollars activates a different part of the mind (the federal government part) than talking about hundreds of dollars. Ultimately, if BTC is going to be mainstream, people will need their minds exercised in each major denomination in different ways. mBTC is useful now only if you can buy something for a couple bucks worth of BTC. e.g. "I got a DVD drive for 25 mBTC from Tiger Direct!"
BTC is the only one relevant right now because the bulk of the community is using it as a store of wealth (which is ok by me - I think they're undervalued myself).

I'm going to have to sort of disagree with you a little bit.
I'm going to articulate a real-world concept in to a simple analogy: Let's say half my tax money goes to roads, and half goes toward killing iraqis. I use and cherish roads, but I *hate* killing iraqis even worse than I hate propping up banks. I know that the present system does not allow me to choose where my tax money goes, but every 300,000,000th bullet that goes in to an iraqi is one that I paid for personally, so I feel personally responsible for the actions of the government that can choose to endorse with full buy-in and cooperation.
What if I avoided paying taxes because I had no control over where the money went, while acknowledging that it goes to some good and some bad?
I'd much rather have an absence of taxes, then find the capitalist who is only interested in fixing the roads by my house and bears no ill-will toward Iraqis, and fund him directly. As an added bonus, he feels absolutely no desire to send a big contribution of my money to Israelis so they can torture palestinian children with it.

What is the benefit to the business to adopt Bitcoin if consumers do not offer premiums for use? See what I did there? Bitcoin is the manifestation of neutrality in currency.
It's like atheism: Nobody's parents ram Atheism down their throat and punish them for questioning it. Atheism is something that people actively seek out when the dogma they have dealt with in their life is proven weak or wrong. Bitcoin exists, therefore people will use it. This analogy runs deeper when you consider that a currency is only a currency because there is *faith* in it.




Why would you ask the question right after making that statement?


Yes to the first part, and no to the second (institutionalizing detracts heavily from the appeal). An alternative that somehow worked better would probably cause a Bitcoin exodus. However, an alternative that works as well or slightly differently (Litecoin) will probably just blend in to the cryptocurrency basket, complete with an exchange rate.


It has real value. People right now are valuing it. People valuing something is what makes something valuable. This question is meaningless, and saying "don't just dismiss it" can, at best, prompt someone to answer with a diversion.
Have you given any thought to the possibility that maybe it's worth **more** than gold? Gold is a trade medium, like BTC, but it has mass, and therefore can't be beamed to the other side of the planet in seconds. There's something useful in the Information Age that gold doesn't have. Is anyone else talking about that? At the end of the day, the best trade mediums will be kept, the worst will be scrapped, and history will laugh them off as archaic.
Bitcoin is the clear victor among today's choices because the Internet exists.

No thanks. Just play my god damned mp3 like a good application, and maybe I'll pay to see you live, and buy a $9 cup of coors light and a $25 t shirt while I'm there.

That clause is there so they can use it (in whatever way they see fit).
Are you going to keep up the anecdotes or are you going to fucking agree that $5 ATM fees exist and that they're ridiculous? Your last couple posts contributed jack shit.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:27:38
In the USA we have an expression: "Nickel and diming". Do you really think it costs them $2 to make a floating point number decrease on a computer at one bank, and increase at another?
ATM fees started much lower and worked their way up to $2 (and yes, they can go much higher depending on where you live), because the bank knows it can get away with it.
I'm afraid you are the proverbial boiled frog.

Statistically better, but still an anecdote. I've been shorted at least twice in my life by an ATM. They never seem to dispense extra cash though.

Taking your business elsewhere is the same as being entitled now?
Keep paying those monthly fees. I'll sleep better knowing you're wasting cash.

You might be right about the regulation thing, but some people (myself included) feel that a little corruption is already too much. Currency in-and-of-itself should be neutral. Otherwise, people who are biased against will find another currency. The "faith" is in the mathematics, which is, so far, a very good place to put your faith.
The government is forced to contend with influence, rather than control, over this new form of money. That is a huge difference to me as well. I'm glad to see they seem to be eager to do what they can, but bear in mind that they'll never run a giant, irreversable deficit of bitcoins. It can't happen.
Hoarding isn't the problem you think it is. I'm holding and I've picked a number I would definitely sell at. I'm sure that's true of most other holders, and if their number is unrealistically high, old age will bring it down, if nothing else.
Fiat is a joke. Anyone looking at the US debt should be able to conclude that, unless they're participating in the mass-delusion that it's sustainable. I've been worried about holding US dollars for a long time. It's a mix of faith and confidence that backs the dollar (and really every other currency), and they're really stretching it now. I think one thing you should be aware of is that this opinion is not unique to me. There are plenty of others who have been looking for a better store-of-value. If it isn't Bitcoin, it'd be something else *exactly* like bitcoin. That's why it's bitcoin.
Thanks for the insight though. It's always nice to hear some contrast to keep my opinions in check.

I think people who are **not** running a full node are the biggest threat to the technology, because the main user base of the internet is trained so well to trust some party (facebook, etc) that it's almost certain that a bitcoin central authority will manifest, and central authorities are governed.

Speculating here: It was around $500 when the China market took off, right?
Since the announcement, the only positive news I've seen is the number of businesses at coinmap.org increasing at a steady pace, and across the globe. I doubt they're done falling, but I don't see them going below $550 for long. The people who unload lower than that price are almost certainly panicking.
It's easy to forget that before China drove the price up, BTC was holding value. I am getting a little nervous at the sheer number of people treating it like a stock, but I think they're just propping the value up higher, and hopefully the fall-out is that they incite public awareness and interest.
We're still always one major announcement away from an adjustment one way or the other. Either way, I'm ready to ride this coaster to the moon or straight in to the ground :) If nothing else, I'm getting some really good entertainment out of it.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:22:26
I read it as saying that if someone is spouting the opinion that bitcoin is a scam, they don't understand it. I think that's way more accurate than your interpretation: The number of people voicing an opinion is still measurable as a sliver.
However, I almost shat a brick when granny brought it up as a Thanksgiving dinner topic, but she didn't call it a scam either.

Yes, it's legitimate like a $5 ATM withdrawal fee.

You think your silly base-10 system is logical? The first time we make contact with an alien race with 3 fingers, you'll have to scrap it and start over. Base-2 is where it's at, and we have that covered with fractions-of-an-inch. ;)
In all seriousness, we've already met the alien, and it is computers. People who think in binary math make excellent programmers.

This could be said of literally any currency (shortly after its inception). The difference with Bitcoin is that it's the essence of what a currency really is: Faith in something. And instead of faith in some government, it's faith in math, to the point where it seems to be an inevitabile phase in the development of any advanced civilization.
At least realize what you're expressing doubt in, and compare it to the things you do choose to put your faith in.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:09:42
Odd question: Being that they seized a private key, and not actual bitcoins (those may as well be considered as residing on the block chain), how does that work?
The way I see it, the government must either recognize it as a currency and keep the keys private, or publicize the evidence as part of the trial, in which case, joe schmoe on the Internet could start spending.

If they crash it, I'll just buy some more. If they prop it up, I'll sell some. It all evens out.

I'm not sure I'm understanding you correctly, but there is (in my opinion) a big factor that people don't seem to account for when talking bitcoin:
It's the precedent setter. If Bitcoin crashes and burns, the world is watching, and it will set other cryptocurrencies back years or decades until people forget about bitcoin and are open to trusting cryptocurrencies again.
I like to think of it in terms of VHS and Betamax: There may be better standards out there (at the moment I'm not convinced that's even true), but only one has mass-acceptance.

I'm on the bitcoin bandwagon, but you added "central" to the definition just to be right. Bitcoin is fiat by definition. Fiat's not a bad word. It's just an (apparently misunderstood) descriptor.
Whether it's decreed by a central authority or a bunch of grassroots citizens of the world, it's still only valuable because we say so.
Edit: You're right. I looked up "decree" and it turns out that a "legal authority" must make one. I'll leave my comment so other suckers don't make the same mistake.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:30:49
I read it (hehe) several times. I didn't downvote you, by the way. I think reddiquette discussion is always on-topic. Some other dick did that.
I have to beg you to reconsider this:


It says way more about you and your baggage than it does aobut the community. People being dicks are *very frequently* contributing something that the average redditor hasn't considered as factual and informative. I get why that's considered bad. I didn't think you needed to cite the rule. However, once again, I'll ask: Where in Reddiquette does it say downvoting is ok if someone is being a dick/jerk/anything like that at all?
