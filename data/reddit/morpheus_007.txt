Yeah but people don't really give two shits about all that- seeing how they so are quick to put money into Bcash/Ripple/Dash. It's only about profits for most, and they could care less about who they hand over the "power" to in the long run. The revolutionary idea behind cryptocurrencies to place people's power and money back into their own hands will eventually wither away because people cared about money and ROIs more. See all the people supporting cryptocurrencies that are centralized without caring about the shady origins or characters behind some coins? As for the Ripple craze- I'm all for people making money, but it sort of feels like no one cares about giving more power to the banks. Wasn't the point of all crypto to remove the need for them so they cannot fuck with the world anymore? I'd say the people who really care about your post are few. I bet you over half the likes you got already are from people that would submit to and kiss the feet of all banks if it meant they would make money.

Look up Essiac Tea, the Gerson therapy, laetrile, vitamin b17, and Dr. Burzynski on youtube or google. Don't think chemo is your only option man. I am a firm believer that Gid has created a treatment for all ailments. Don't expect to find them from a medical establishment that rejects alternative treaments that have worked for others who were told they will die. I hope you don't dismiss this message like the majority of people who pass it off as bs without even researching it first. God be with you

This sort of thing makes me glad to see the beauty of love in humanity. Gives me hope and shows how generous our community is to the other good people in it

It is investing in technology and the future. I do agree it is a bit of a gamble, but so is everything else. You gamble when you buy a house or start a business, since the price may turn to shit or your business might tank. You gamble when you vote for people into office. You gamble when marrying someone without a prenup lol. Unlike straight up gambling that's purely chance and a roll of the dice, we can research and inform ourselves to make the best decision possible. Like investing that Apple has a future. For example, if you buy Bitcoin you are investing in a decentralized future where banks may vanish, and if you buy ripple you are investing in a future where it's the same shit armed with different tech. Whether you admit it or not, investing in crytpos is like voting for what you want the future to be dominated by

So does this mean people will swap all their BCH to BTC now and end this whole scheme supported by many shady individuals pretending to be the real Bitcoin?

With hopes that Satoshi lingers around reddit, curious to what how it's affecting world and what the people think of all this: Wherever you are Satoshi, you are the man. A legend that seeks not fame *cough* fuck Craig Wright *cough* that has created a solution for the ones under the oppressive thumbs to allow us to retake power and control of our finances into our own hands. For that I (and many others) salute you and the world will always be grateful to you, and remember you as you wished to be remembered as: Satoshi Nakamoto. *cough* my bets on Charlie Lee *cough* Don't hate. It's fun to think about.

If these big mac coins (BMC) were made in the past when big macs were a few cents, imagine the value now. It's centralized too though and censorable. They don't accept BMCs from homeless trying to order in the drive thru. And sooner or later they will change it to McDonald's Coins through a hard fork so that they can charge more coins per big mac than allow it to have buying power of one full le big mac

I look forward to swaps as well. We will one day see a world where merchants who accept Bitcoin will be able to be paid in Litecoin, miners of ASIC resistant coins like Vertcoin could swap it easily for BTC, Monero users will no longer have to get them in exchanges and swap via LTC directly for Monero if they want privacy, others who own Decred, Particle(?) Komodo, Ethereum and even Stellar Lumens if they use Lightning will also be able to join the party.  Eventually all the major cryptos will coexist like merchants accepting different credit cards at the moment. Question is, will the communities of each crypto be able to embrace and help each other, or will it be more like "I only want my crypto to succeed and the rest can burn and disappear"?
