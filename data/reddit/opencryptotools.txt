if they mess up the extra long chilli chesse and you're selling the original recipe next door, i think you'd be fine to call youself the original
(im not a bch supporter i even sold all mine for btc out of principle but just for the sake of your analogy)
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:04:51
it got through :D
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:05:59
is it possible to loose sent btc with fees set too low?
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:17:28
he just knew it would go through.. i showed him the transaction before i sent it and ensured him its no problem because also i was super excited to do it

today i bought bitcoin locally for like a hundred euro and i needed a cab on my way home, unfortunately none of the nearby available cabs were taking my card and i had no cash on me!
so one of them said they would accept my card so i used this car and got home. when i pulled my card out his card reader wouldnt funcion so i joked about maybe he would take my bitcoin instead as i always try to do!
he told me he was into bitcoin, bought the top and lost like 5k. he said it wasnt hurting him too much but it was still not the best thing that has happened to him obviously. so i said if he takes my bitcoin i would send him 15$ instead of 10 and he instantly agreed.
i didnt want to take a picture of him or the taxi lisence in the car bc of privacy issues for him so i took this photo for my friends to show them what happened.
im posting this because im really hyped about getting into a cab and actually have a driver who is willing to accpet my btc after having asked i think at least 100 cab drivers to do so. (mostly as a joke bc normally they dont do it anyways)
if you believe my story send him some small goodies if youre into that. its really not my address but his binance account. (he doesnt even have a proper wallet)
peace out
@_date: 2018-08-19 06:23:26
its ok youre writing this it obviously looks a little like i just want some money but this was genuinely a cab driver.
i could send the whatsapp chats with my friends right after it happend but what do i actually care what some suspicious stranger on the internet thinks
@_date: 2018-08-19 06:22:00
dude.... i dont care.. dont send money dont do anything. i know the picture doesnt proof the story. but it happened just like that.... dont send any money i dont give a ff tbh

but it will most likely only be ico shills so were fine
@_date: 2018-10-29 14:31:48
haha +1
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:03:06
what does it tell me?
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:31:20
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:26:49
did you look it up already?
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:39:50
thats buddy at least u got my point ;D
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:07:53
1. its easier to denominate the altcoin and other values this way
2. new people will feel like they own 240000 bitcoins while they have 24000 satoshis which makes it instantly more attractive to buy
3. more practical in general but i think since were denominating 100.000.000 satoshis as 1 bitcoin from the beginning on there is little chance my proposal will win out
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:16:39
shortterm yes, but i think absolute lows might range as low as slightly below 2k range
@_date: 2018-11-12 13:26:48
what in particular were they saying was bad?
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:03:26
i need a mirror to this
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:35:18
i cant even watxh this video myself
@_date: 2018-11-05 22:06:02
i like this a lot conceptually and i think it will/would work just fine like this. but im interested: would you be able to define a negative attribute about it not only relying on altruism but on a somehow incentivized model?
i will read through the article you posted thanks! btw: some people are involved in bitcoin, a lot, like me: for year but still its somehow very technical in some respects this is why im asking also! you need lots of time to understand all of this.
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:35:02
fully open source? they did an ico last year
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:14:34
it might just be tx spam is over and thats it? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:04:27
lol why so salty many ppl considered me a stupid person bc i quit school and had worse grades and shilled everyone into bitcoin for years almost nobody listened and now they mad af and get mad by this ad its a joke its a play its not serious its funny i like it
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:44:01

@_date: 2017-07-25 01:08:14
Theres also an exchange in vienna "The House Of Nakamoto"
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:08:07
you know it's kind of the same argument to say: needing "450$" for storing the entire Bitcoin blockchain on a smart phone  about 2 times is a lot
and saying: paying 6$ to onboard onto lightning for a 10$ transaction is a lot.
I would argue the latter i consider more expansive. But it's all a matter of perspective. Noone can disagree that storing less than a TB will be extremely easy in the future. We all know this.
And i don't think it has been done death, it's still an important question for BTC.
Also i literally wrote in my post that i DO NOT BELONG to the BCH camp. I support BTC. Please.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:54:35


not true. it depends
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:23:44
Thats the point. You want to have very large blocks with a lot of information in it. The incentive is for users to pay high fees for large blocks. If they want to include whatever into their transaction. There is a sideeffect to this where you have to PAY in order to SPAM. This will make it economically very hard to spam a lot.
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:42:18
I'd argue it's both. And i agree that the the attributes of the transaction are worth a lot. That doesn't mean it HAS to be expansive in order for the network to operate properly..
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:12:43
99.9999% of people using Bitcoin DO NOT send "billions of dollars in 10 minutes". The avarage customer sends  1000$ or less. Usually way less. And they all should have the chance to use the Bitcoin network. I agree btw, sending 1 billion dollar for 3$ in 10 minutes on a decentralized ledger is AMAZING.
But it's about scaling, ON CHAIN, for the demand the market has RIGHT NOW. I don't want 8 MB blocks. I want to increase the blocksize 0,5-1MB further to have more onboard capacity for LN and smaller transactions that wait ages to confirm nowadays.
It doesn't have to be like this. We can have both, easily.
And btw: Who are those people telling people they are fucking idiots for asking legitimate concerning questions.
I'm trying not make Bitcoin better and useful. I don't want to make hateful comments. I want to understand and discuss. Please fuck off sir
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:16:07
[ looks very nice!
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:11:08
doesnt seem to work
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:45:54
The channel might have been shut down by now. Easily possible. Happens all the time.
I will not leave because you say this. I'm not leaving my country because i disagree with it's politics.
People in developing countries NEED cheap fees. It's essential for them. How is this hard to see?
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:16:18
i obviously can. i'm just suggesting to have A LITTLE blocksize increase after we grew so much. how is it THAT controversial?
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:30:05
one love
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:19:31
also for europeans? i cant use it..
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:28:32
you had me at ian balina
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:21:30
shipping yes, but no btc payment method
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:27:15
for now i think they are the best solution posted here, i have not yet ordered.. have you had experience with them?
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:13:28
i tried to use this now but it appears its cz republic only? at least their shipping methods?
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:21:34
what if Bitcoin goes to 35k US$. You think a kid in the streets of Venezuela wants to pay 7$ to open a lightning channel? When 35$ is all he has? I'm literally not trying to dramatize this but it's just so obvious to me
Like i said. I am 100% with Core. But i think it is certainly time to increase the blocksize limit. It would make Bitcoin work way better than it already is for current capacity needed by network demand
