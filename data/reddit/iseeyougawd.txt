The idea of a intranet is unreachable. So you need to use the internet but when every government block the ip where all nodes communicate bitcoin crash. And I think company or government owns the satellite too.

That means when the connection between the nodes is separated the network shut down.

The so often advertised statement that the Bitcoin decentralized is simply wrong, I understand that correctly? the address under which the nodes could communicate with each other could therefore be simply blocked and thus the complete Bitcoin network would be broken.im right?

More info??

yes, but bitcoin communicates on the basis of the internet? So should Bitcoin be under censorship like Facebook in South Korea, the nodes would not be able to connect and then the network breaks down.

In Germany I would say. What a man can build ..... He also can destroy.

I don't know ... Is it possible ?

I think tor and other systems can blocked too. When bitcoin halded and only a few nodes are there. The network exist but don't work. And a network who don't work isnt a network. The hope die at least.

What you mean?
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:07:37
I think I understand bitcoin enough. The question isnt can i trust bitcoin? The question is ,can I trust the owner of the internet.. which means 
Companies or government...

Yes that's true.
