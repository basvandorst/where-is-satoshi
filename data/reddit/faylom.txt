From what I understand, China has been keeping its currency pegged by buying and selling US bonds to reduce or increase the Yuan's value but controlling the amount of it on the market.
This latest move has been them refusing to buy more US bonds as their currency naturally fell in value. I can't see any moral justification from the US side.

Isn't that what's going to happen with a majority of keys eventually?

Ah, I see.
You must be doing some level of trading if the cost of getting the citizenship is eclipsed by the savings.
Or was it much less expensive for your chosen country?

Well, I'm certainly curious. 
I'm a dual citizen myself by birth, but maybe I should look into collecting a few more!
I guess I've been lazy about it cause i don't see myself living outside the EU.

Can I ask what your purpose in getting the second passport is?
I don't really get the whole thing. I can understand wanting an EU passport to be able to travel and live there. Is that the idea?

But is that simply in relation to where you live and travel and buy property or are there business related uses that I'm not getting?

I'm going to hell for saying this but Americans are really stupid, lol

I was reading about this recently. There's a fair few places that offer citizenship by investment and even more that give long term favorable visas to people who bring in enough money.
According to this, 
Maltese citizenship doesn't cost €1 million, either.

No, I think it was unintentional.
Why would he be so sly? Every one of his comment replies was taking him as being sincere.


This part also doesn't make sense if he was making a dry comment about plagiarism.

So let me get this straight. You are 16, made a comment (which is over 2000 karma on wrote a long list of things the OP had done, containing things that could be seen as very impressive or unbelievable for a 16yo to have organised,  left a typo that could change the meaning of your comment entirely and you stuck in a (possibly snarky) smiley face. 
Your comment is good. But every other 16 year old kid would just toss in loads of sarcasm, removing all ambiguity, and see what happens.
Keep up the paste and you will become big :)

Because if the person was being sincere, it's just more praise to point out she didn't do what an inexperienced person would typically do.
TBH i agree that the comment on its own looks like it could be irony but I guess I would be pissed off and reply again if nobody picked up what I was putting down in that situation. Commenter might not have been like me, I guess.

Wow, and your mother in law actually gives her that little?
