if its the ledger nano s there might be other coins on there as well not just Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:39:38
install the other apps for the other coins with the help of people here on reddit without giving away the information of course.
here is a list of possible coins on this USB:

save this thread .. you will see it will come true :-D

if the customer hadnt written me i would have never found out about that they keep the difference. they keep it UNTIL there is a refund. 
if the customer doesnt know this they will never see the money and i wont either.

i own  the people who use bitcoin on it went from 0 beginning last year to about 20-30 transactions per month
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:54:16
:-D welcome
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:13:11
satoshi is not one person. it was a group of people. did some research on it
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:05:21
myspace was uniquely successful until it was replaced... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:47:50
its not catastrophic.. people will just keep using bitcoin...
this is africa inflation reversed
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:03:48
you should really change this. its totally unfair and incorrect the system... or at least email the merchant and customer and tell them they overpaid.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:09:27
oh yeah :-D
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:24:10
i unloaded my card.. just cause i was too lazy to fill out the shit...
EU is trying to limit everything they can now.. this train cant be stopped. could have more than quintupled my money i loaded on the card instead
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:23:26
not at all.. its a free payment landing page
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:55:34
its not for everyone. :-) but some people who want all payment and amazon wishlist and bitcoin on one page can do that. its like a business card with links to payment possibilities
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:38
disagree.... everyone will accept bitcoin so fast fiat is history
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:41:50
just fixed something during registration. should work now
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:02:48
i wouldnt compare bitcoin with silver... but i agree with the rest
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:40:35
one problem tho... if you get overpaid.. happened to me a couple of times... coingate keeps the difference.
they just kept $60 from a $70 transaction because the invoice was $10. i am waiting from their support to fix this issue
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:27:58
myspace was before FB... they didnt invent social networking
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:38:35
at least someone has the same intuition :-D
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:47:13
yes. exactly
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:24
but the important variable was missing. mass adoption of something that people want to hold more than fiat
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:11:13
thats what sales tax is for. in fact you are being double taxed
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:47:48

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:35:15
non taken... :-D
@_date: 2018-10-07 09:42:26
same algorithm though... smartass :-D 
@_date: 2018-10-02 08:25:45
absolutely true
@_date: 2018-10-02 08:25:29
i will definitely write about it once i come across it :-)
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:17:40
yes i do... would you take a knife from a serial killer and give it back to them?
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:20:18
awesome thank you... will take a look
problem was they started using proxies 
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:51:48
donating to charity makes sense.. i do that anyway. i am a big fan of kiva.org always lend there. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:39:47
actually most of them dont want it back. i never hear from them after i ask for verification photo

you should check your solar plexus.. sexual / joy disfunction
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:22:05
i think 90% of their accounts are in cold storage.
they closed my account without explanation.
but to be fair they made it really easy to transfer the BTC somewhere else
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:38:45
dont tell her .. she will tell every other idiot
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:40:42
think of the excitement of improving the lifestyle without telling where it came from :-D
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:42:33
btw, p2p lending will let you live off that money easily
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:39:31
problem is more like she would tell everyone else and the shit begins
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:38:58
dont tell her .. she will tell every other idiot
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:41:45
" I believe the money was one of the things that led to her having affairs and then pushing for a divorce" lol yeah right... there was lack of love from the beginning. hate to tell you buddy
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:43:04
good advice but i think its even easier and shows that you dont have ego when you can keep it to yourself
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:44:13
good advice
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:38:51
dont tell her .. she will tell every other idiot
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:23:28
its statistically calculated... across thousands of loans and platforms.
with +1m in assets you can be on 3 platforms with 5-7% return on thousands of loans

try akasha.. decentralized reddit.
reddit sucks now
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:45:13
theory: everything has been growing at exponential rate but just now we think to perceive it as such because it has reached our limited frequency range :-)
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:55:24
and wait 3 minutes before they let you go :-)

BTC bocadillos hombre :-D
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:51:51
i guess best would be just to import the wallet into bitcoin core? that should fix all problems? :-D
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:50:58
thx :-D fixed
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:34:22
will do that :-) thank you for your help
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:21:52
not sure what you mean by pending balances.
i did the exact same transaction in 2016 from the same wallet and address and it went through. now in 2017 it didnt go through with that error.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:12:37
yep.. i think its him
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:13:04
so true :-D
