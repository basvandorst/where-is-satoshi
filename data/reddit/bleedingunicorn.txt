 Virtual Currencies may hold long\-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system

Never heard of it , looking promising - 400k tps and low transaction fees !

 People don't know where the market is going so I just make my own decisions and ignore everyone, because clearly they have no clue. I ve chosen for myself 2 great and promising projects with fastest tps \- Stellar and Credits

Nahhh if u invest in CS that d never happen

Hahah. well, I prefer trading with Stellar and CS because of their fast tps

 However, cryptocurrency as an asset class and the blockchain underpinnings could be a permanent part of mankind's future. I think Eos, Neo and Cs defo will survive

Wow thats a good news so they need faster tps like credits have

CS gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user super fast like 1mln tps per sec, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate.
