How did you come up with the "up to $7000" figure?

Yeah, my co-worker came in my office yesterday afternoon to gloat that Bitcoin was down $3000 (he didn't take my suggestion to buy some a few months back). I was working, so I hadn't been following the drop. I pulled up the 1 Week chart and saw that Bitcoin was back to Monday's price. Then I pulled up the 1 Month and showed him it's still up 25%. Then I pulled up the 3 Month and showed him how he would've doubled his money if he listened to me.
Then he left my office.

Dip? It's higher than it was a week ago.

Thanks for the tip on minimizing conflict. We often have spirited debates about investments among other things and it was a nice ego-stroke getting to sit there listening to him show pity over my losses. I have made money on his advice in the past, however, so I'll continue the dialog moving forward.
The interesting thing to me was that he only came in to gloat because of the news articles that hit yesterday hyping the drop. His awareness of bitcoin is completely based on media reporting, so he had no idea how ridiculous he sounded trying to put down an investment that's up so much for me.
