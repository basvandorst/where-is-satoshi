I hope so, the first time I got into bitcoin was because someone was tipping random redditors to raise awareness.

This is with all bank routing  transactions, not just coinbase. If you want to go faster you have to wire transfer or use a debit card. Just keep in mind the fees.

or debit card

Thanks for taking the time to develop this, I imagine the implementation can be quite complex.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:13:28
Developers working on it
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:16:18
Why would you even make up such obvious bs?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:05:24
I disagree, the only reason I got into bitcoin was because someone was tipping redditors to raise awareness. Tipping isnt limited to this sub and would be nice if used in places like Bitcoin had tipping before implemented their own, the developers moved on however.

Best of luck to Mcgregor

Im confused, I came back to bitcoin after a couple years just before the bump. Isnt having high fees a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:08:28
This is causing an overvaluation though no? So it will drop off for a bit
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:18:52
