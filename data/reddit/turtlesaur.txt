It's cool. My Mom still thinks I'm making illegal money from playing games. "No I'm mining and receive coins when a block is solved" "But isn't it illegal to create money?"

My condolences. That shit is tragic man.. I have no idea what I would do other than spiral into depression - assuming that was your majority holding. Godspeed sir, I hope you are stronger than I.

Uhm, at the continuation of this thread I must admit my rig is no where near that power hungry and costs a fraction of that, and my Mom also doesn't pay my power bills. Source: Am 26.

For a Bitcoin to be $1,000,000 it would need to increase in value 120x bringing it to a market value of 19 trillion dollars. This is worth more than 5 Apples, 5 Amazon's, 5 Microsofts and 5 Google's put together.
