When their dollar will crash, how will they enforce this kind of bullshit ?

Never say never my friend, there are always exceptions and with time things change. 
Have you ever heard about a tiny country named Marshall Islands ?

Basically put your money were your mouth is

We should see this as a test on a small scale. It’s going to be a great experience that will point what’s good and what will need to be improved.

Two people (I won’t assume their gender) sitting facing each other holding their hands.

Voters ain’t got any power, that’s a myth. 
There are so many examples were “elected” governments bypassed the voters decisions.

Félicitations l’ami !

They replaced the dollar by their own crypto currency. 
And whatever you may say about their location or inhabitants, it’s a country and it makes the “never” statement false.

Wrong, in this case he is holding not hodling

It depends on when you want to exit the market 
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:28:44
You’re confusing democracy and representative system right here. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:23:33
Buy the ATH
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:54:31
It has nothing to do with coinmarketcap this time. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 09:31:58
Ok Mr. Lawmaker
@_date: 2018-05-31 06:13:52
He forgot or bypassed the decentralized aspect.

Lmao did you did some researches on interest rates ?
Germany and France didn’t create that money, they borrowed it insanely cheap to help the Greeks, with a nice interest majoration, making profit on the dead cat. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:35:39
Then you shouldn’t be worried about micro fluctuations at this time 
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:03:21
You should do your maths bru
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:19:45
It depends on the country, government, and policy you’re dealing with.

As usual Tether FUD when the market is bearish

By using Pundi X, it’s an early project but it seems legit
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:12:59
And remember, police can’t sentence you to anything, it’s the judge role, don’t pay attention to their bluff and call a lawyer. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:32:02
Same thing here in France, you need a licence from the AMF, but people are not really aware of this and may say it to the police in good faith. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 01:39:16
Lol nice try u/IbizHigh

What you should know is that with all new techs, electric development and battery storage. 
The gold supply will decrease and demand will increase as hell during the next years. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:52:21
That’s when I buy, and when I see moon posts spreading that’s when I short.

Lower it gets, easier the manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:17:11
I confirm, and that’s a huge mistake. 
Many stones and metals will become more and more rare, and our needs will increase with the new technologies (solar tech, batteries...). 
But how can you blame them, why would they invest in something stable as stocks when they don’t even own their own flat/house ?
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:54:52
Why they should keep shorting ? Because they can do it. It’s as simple as that, they’re not young investors playing with 300$ from their school bench. They’re here to make the maximum profit. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:49:53
Lol as usual when there are crisis, blame the foreigners hahaha classic human bullshit. 
The banks fail, then people blame everything and everybody, but not the banks, so fuckin hilarious. 
Right wing will say it’s the stranger, left wing will say it’s the rich. 
The crowd is really the most manipulable thing on this planet, always tricked into a new lie.
