This is actually a fairly legitimate point.  I was thinking this the other day.  If you consider how people are being advised to look after their bitcoins it is quite similar to gold.  It's more practical to store currency as fiat as banks are regulated and guaranteed.  I never worry about my bank deposits, but I certainly worry about my bitcoins.

"Coinfloor holds client funds in segregated client accounts in the largest bank in Poland."

I know ripple is a bad word around here, but would that not be more applicable to this sort of process?

Yes, but not necessarily because of Bitcoin.  There is already a system of digital money that could replace cash.  I hardly ever use cash these days.

If this is all true,
"Coinfloor operates with a 100% cold storage policy. All our clients bitcoin are received, stored and sent out from within multiple underground vaults which maintain the same security standards as the Bank of England.
No bitcoin are ever stored on a server, ensuring that if an attacker had complete access to any of our online servers, our client bitcoin would not be compromised.
Our system has been built such that no single person, server, vault location or device failure could compromise the integrity of client bitcoin.
As a result of our strict security policy, bitcoin withdrawals take place 3 times a day during business hours."
and they're legitimately UK based then this looks like it could be a great exchange.

*the blockchain technology

It's instant.  I.e. it was there when I first logged in.

Well a UK bank transfer usually only takes a minute or so. ( These things are not actually too attached to the respective underlying technologies and more to do with implementation.

Due to the way the reddit voting system works it doesn't really matter if people repost stuff.  It will get buried if everyone has already seen it.

I got it using a .ac.uk email address.  Will obviously depend on your Uni though.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:09:42
Yeah, in my experience most people have heard about it.  I asked my Gran at Christmas and even she had.  
Of course people knowing about it is very different to actually using it.

Of course the best part is that it's actually a British Marine and not a US soldier at all.   
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:12:02
That's interesting, where did you find that out?  Eventually bitcoiners will have to be people of all views if it is to be a success.
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:07:17
Obviously everyone producing an altcoin understands this as a bare minimum. /s
@_date: 2014-09-04 17:29:22
That's because it's designed that way.  A bitcoin transaction is more analogous to a bank transfer.

Can someone confirm this isn't shopped?

To rationalise such large debt numbers I like break it down per capita, then imagine it as a 25 year mortgage.  It then becomes apparent that it's a relatively affordable price for a once in a generation crisis.

Can someone tell me what the odds of three people in a thread all posting for the first time is?
