For those of us who didn't just learn about crypto this year, who know its original intent, and the correct way to use it...the idea of keeping documentation for tax purposes is a totally new concept especially considering the whole point was to avoid governments, banks, and taxes in the first place.
So what advice would you give for bringing crypto assets that were designed or intended to be "off the books" or outside the system onto the books and into the system?
Is paying capital gains on the "full market value" the safest bet?
Yeah I get it, its a public ledger, but what if I'm not autistic and don't remember every address I used for every transactions. What if I used crypto like your supposed to use crypto with local wallets instead of exchange wallets? What if I moved between blockchains and deleted old wallets files out of an abundance of caution?
"Civil Asset Forfeiture" worries me more than taxes for the same reason described above, care to comment on that as well?
Which government is the most friendly in this scenario and how do I become a citizen?

Wikipedia "tax evasion"...
Avoidance is not evasion, not paying taxes is not evasion its not paying taxes, but someday you might get a tax bill + interest then what do you do? Also the seller of physical goods is apparently require to keep records for their taxes, do they have your shipping address?

Can anyone verify if this is legit?
Is Kraken the only exchange that limits to $100k?
Is that one transaction of $100k or 100 transactions of $1000?
Have you tried OTC traders like Genesis or ItBit?

I'm not a CPA but I've read somewhere "gifting" eventually runs afoul of the estate tax and basically "someone" pays the estate tax the gifter or if the gifter can't be found sometime the giftee...remember the government has been playing this game for years they know all the tricks, I believe you have to report it, but might not have to pay taxes on it until it gets to the $millions

This is really bad info friend and people that say things like this should be shamed and tracked as enemies of the people. Do a little reading, what data is actually stored on a blockchain? What happens if I exchange my coins for coins on another blockchain? Where is that data tracked? What happens if that new blockchain stores less data or is encrypted like XMR or ZEC? However your statement is still partially correct "You can be tracked off the blockchain"...if your doing it wrong. You'll find nothing works like its suppose to if your doing it wrong!

Its incorrect but the IRS only cares if you're incorrect at their expense, if your incorrect at your own expense they won't say s**t
What's the difference on 10% x $10000 vs 10% x $9800?  $20
F**k it I lost all my records the IRS can keep my overpayment of $20, I just made that money back not going through all the bullshit
