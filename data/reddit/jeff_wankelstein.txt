I'm just stating the hard facts
Anyone who wants this porn and more for free and in top quality, just signup to empornium.me and download to your hearts content
If you really want to support the porn industry (I don't see why you would want to, amateur is better aesthetically and morally), then just donate to the actors themselves. Almost every porn actor these days has a twitter/tumblr/facebook account. Don't give your money to greedy grubs like this dude who contributes nothing as a reseller and just skims the money off the top (while claiming to do it for charity - the nerve!)

Holy fuck
I was going to say 'Thanks for the free porn!' after getting into your member's area
But I clicked on the zip file downloads which are several gigabytes each, and the ETA is several hours to a day! 
It's crawling at about 100-200kb/s it seems. Fuck that, I canceled it.
Not only don't you provide screens so people can see what they're buying, but you're not even supplying decent download speeds!
Empornium maxes out my speeds on most popular torrents (~3.5MB/s)

**[ANYONE WHO WANTS THE BUNDLE FOR FREE, CLICK HERE](
**IDIOT OP INCLUDED THE ACCESS KEY TO THE MEMBERS AREA IN HIS SCREENSHOTS LOL**
And if you want better quality than 720p, download from Empornium for free ;)

99% of porn is boring to revolting, especially the 'professional' as opposed to amateur porn which consists for the most part of cake-faced coke whores struggling to hold up a grin as Tyrese shoves his cheap chinese silicone penis extender into her diddly hole
Who would want to support that, and also support the likes of you, some greedy kike who has nothing to do with making porn, but saw an opportunity to become a reseller - and you claim 'its for charity guiz!!!'
Figures that Bitcoiners are middle-aged chumps who'll pay for it though. Wouldn't be surprised if these guys don't even know about sites like Imagefap or Empornium.
While Bitcoiners are silently bemoaning the fact that they just copped out $10+ for a few 720p 'mystery box' porn vids based on only a 250 x 180 deceptive promo image they're presented with, I'm downloading whole catalogues and sets from Empornium in 1080p or even 4k resolution for free *after* I view the screen previews that the uploader has generously serviced me with.
