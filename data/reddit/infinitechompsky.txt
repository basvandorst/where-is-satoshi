You have a hilariously faith-based argument, it's like watching someone try to argue for truth based on biblical readings :D
You also seem to think I'm pushing Bitcoin Cash as some amazing thing, when I'm not. As I summed it up to the user who PM'd me asking for advice after reading this thread, they're both scams, it's just funny watching one scam try and point fingers at the other for being a scam:

How is this a scam? Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Legacy are both Bitcoin. One is just the new version that helps drop all the problems Bitcoin Legacy is stuck with. Bloomberg even had a nice overview of the differences this morning.
Your comment reads like someone complaining that both Windows 10 and Windows XP are both called Windows.

Not even remotely true. To continue my Windows analogy, 64 bit versions have dropped support for Windows 3.x applications. They're not compatible, but it doesn't mean it's not a new version. Things evolve, one of the fundamental truths of life and if you haven't learned that already you will some day.

That's the economic understanding of a 14 year old who just read a blog post on libertarianism.
I'll copy a post I made earlier on why inflation is needed and why deflation kills economies:

What's rude is you spamming your shitty store and getting butthurt when others point out better deals.

eBay bought PayPal back in the early 2000's: 
They spun them off again in 2015.

You're making the assumption that there's no compelling public interest in regulating energy production/use to label that a misuse of power. I believe you'll find the courts extremely skeptical of that position.

And? Opinions aren't illegal. Laws are opinions, we as a society find X harmful, unfair and wrong. We subsidize certain activity through  the tax code because we as a society find  it helpful or wanted. Why you believe it being an opinion is disqualifying or bad is something for you, but it has no bearing on whether it's kosher legally.

We weren't talking about your paper in this thread OR me having an opinion, we were talking about your belief that a city government banning Bitcoin mining because of it's impact on the electrical grid is a misuse of power because 'waste' is an opinion.
