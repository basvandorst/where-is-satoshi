Imho it's not very stupid idea, but a long password is only one layer and there's a chance that somebody from Google (in your example) would want to see what secrets you hide and "just take a look". So I'd advise 2 more layers.
Layer 2: the file should not say what it contains and maybe just store the private keys there without giving any hint what they actually are. Then we have there only a strange file with a lot of strange characters.
Layer 3: There are many cloud storage providers and some are (at least on paper) better than the others - they say that they store your data encrypted and only you can read your data. Tresorit does this and I think there are others too. This reduces the chance others to read your file. (Of course, if you get some trojan on your computer, or your sell your HDD, that's another vulnerability, but that's why you have more levels of security after all).

I've tried it today. And something is odd.
If I generate an address with segwitaddress.org, it shows a 3.. address. Good. If I import private key into Electrum 3.0.3, it gives me an old-style 1.. address. Not good.
If I generate a BIP39, 12 words seed and make a correct SegWit wallet in Electrum 3.0.3, I copy the private key of one of the addresses and create a new wallet of that one, the new address is good, it's the same 3.. address.
Can somebody tell what's wrong?

I think that the crypto "banks" should start behaving like banks, meaning to (double-) insure their money.
And if that will happen, I think that such banks will also start to offer facilities like exchange.
All other ways to store your coins at 3rd party is - sooner or later - a place to loose that money.
