There needs to be some set block time and there are a bunch of other alts that reduce this block time. Having shorter blocktimes does speed up transactions but there are benefits to having longer block times. It reduces orphaned blocks as there is less of a chance of a block being found at similar times by two different miners. It also adds security as it becomes a lot more difficult to mine malicious blocks ahead of the chain as it is a lot more difficult to mine blocks. It's also gives more of a chance for blocks to be propagated across the network giving everyone a fair chance at finding the next block. This is where people argue that bitcoin should be a store of value as it is one of the slowest networks but is significantly more secure than any other network.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:34:24


lol more like years
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:11:58
It's all according to the longest chain. So if a block gets mined by two different miners across the globe and they both propagated the found block at pretty much the same time then half of the network would update their node according to one and the other half to the other. Both chains would be the same length so the orphan block gets decided when the next block is mined after that. Once the next block  is mined then the longest chain rule can be applied and the orphan block is discarded. This happens once in a while and it's very very unlikely to happen two blocks in a row

Site is definitely not a scam
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:47:26
There is no position in queue. Just a pool of transactions waiting to be scooped up.  They don't get confirmed sequentially.  Miners just pick out the txs with the larger fees. Look up what fees are currently being picked up (sat/byte) and see how yours compares
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:10:32
I'll give you an actual answer... Basically r/btc believes bitcoin should scale on-chain while r/bitcoin believes it should scale off-chain. Both believe they are the real bitcoin and hate each other. Just a toxic environment of toddlers on both sides pretty much 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:23:48
They used to have bitcoin faucet that would give out free bitcoin to help distribution but those are long gone

Coinbase is the way to go
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:24:09
mempool isnt nearly as bloated as it used to be.  People were complaining about tx fees when it was larger than 100mb
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:14:27
Sad to see it drop but it was bound to happen.  Kinda a relief to finally see it go down after so much climbing 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:01:58
Oh okk this paints a better picture
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:13:04
Coinbase doesn't allow USD/BTC trading in Canada
@_date: 2016-06-02 14:13:26
Use GDAX.  You login in with your coinbase credentials and you can easily transfer any amount of bitcoin from your coinbase wallet and immediately start  trading.  If you dont end up liking it, all you need to do is transfer the bitcoin back
@_date: 2016-06-25 02:49:09
Lol how do I set up mining on my old laptop? I'm tryin to make some quick coin
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:43:10
crypto is too sporadic and volatile for much technical analysis to work. Not to mention people are so emotional and speculation is all over the place so the price doesnt like to follow trends set in stock trading
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:51:02
Mempool is bloated af rn even some higher fee tx aren't going through.  I recommend looking up an appropriate fee before sending in the future
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:18:39
This guy is a fuckin nut idk why so many people listen to him.  One moment he tells you btc is going to explode then the next he's going on about aliens and shit.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:28:34
Lol then then they should stick with bch and hold.  For the long run ;)
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:49:09
Coinbase is the most secure.  You only hear those stories because the people that end up having an issue are the most vocal and aren't very compliant with customer support. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:25:04
I wouldn't say bitcointalk.  That site is rarely insightful anymore

Don't fuckin lie.  I know that sub can be ridiculous but they are that stupid and ignorant
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:33:15
Far more reliable than poloniex.  I haven't had any complains and I've been using them mainly for the past few months.  There's different levels of verification.  I have a basic account which is just my name and address and I can withdraw 3btc a day
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:18:37
Maybe but the fact that core devs hold this much power over the direction of Bitcoin is enough to split a good chunk of people

They are just looking at the ATH and 24hr min which would be 4400 to 3650.  They silly.  It's more like 4200 to 4000

Let's see if it can actually break trough $4500.  Third time is the charm.  If it doesn't prepare for a barrage of FUD

Waiting for people to finish dumping there coins plus difficulty readjust on the weekend.  The same people still believe in Bitcoin cash, it's the Bitcoin core people on this subreddit that tell you it's garbage.  There's a whole different crowd on r/btc

Oh thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:09:35

@_date: 2017-11-13 14:52:25
Is it that outrageous to run it something with more than 4gb of ram? I don't see why it has to be limited because some guy wants to run a full node on his pi. Spend more than $20 on something to run a node or don't run one
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:41:11
I used to see it a lot on the dark wiki if you're ever on there. It's actually where i first saw bitcoin being used. Girls were doing cams for 4-5 BTC as session
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:54:54
lol I hope you're joking 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:28:51
Some people like to sell all there positions when they feel the market is overbought as a whole. Also, many people think the success of alts depends on the success of btc and know a pull back on btc without any reason usually means a pull back on the market. If you don't use any ta or don't know what youre doing it's usually a safe strat
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:06:39
Well what purpose does LTC have when everyone is using the lightning network?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:24:51
Yea it was ~$3.50 a coin
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:49:52
What makes you think they are spamming the mempool? Bitcoin cash spiked in price so mining left the core chain but it's back now. They have no control over what the miners do
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:44:47
Its not about how much money was stolen but the fact that it was stolen. People are waiting for a correction and faith in Tether is already a little thin
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:39:23
money is money. You think these bot traders gaf?

@_date: 2017-11-23 03:13:13
ONLY 1.93? what joke indeed
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:57:29
mempool still greater than 100Mb
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:07:01
You're dilusional. The mempool hardly gets cleared with full hashrate let alone miners leaving the network. Your accusation is just speculation but if you look at the blocktimes and hashpower it's clear what is going on. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:47:54
Mostly time. Once you sell on the other exchange you gotta transfer the money back to coinbase to buy back which takes time. Price of btc could easily increase by a couple hundred dollars before you can buy back. Also, prices will be different when trading USD vs USDT
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:19:04
man these replies are pathetic. Really shows where bitcoin has gone. Fuck this shit man im in the same boat
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:15:17
Oh yes this is a clear sign! You have to smoke up 7 times though if you really want to abide by the 420 price rules 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:56:26
If only we could. Fuck everyone in crypto rn. All parties suck
@_date: 2017-04-17 00:13:41
depends on your interpretation of what BTC should be.  Sure its not a big deal if you're only sending large transactions but try sending $10 to a buddy when transactions are a bit high then you'll see why its an issue
@_date: 2016-09-07 14:17:03
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:55:39
No he means bitcoin is more secure and he is right 
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:28:15
Idk fees will eat up a lot of that money and it will never grow to be anything substantial
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:41:19
This is quite the conspiracy theory and people aren't gonna like it but I like hearing your thoughts.  Let's see what happens
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:28:02
Ya and obviously a lot of them are garbage but trading on Poloniex (I much prefer Bittrex) gives you the option to buy undervalued coins with solid development that you believe in.  For example, I'm heavily invested in Blocknet.  Sure it's a little ways off mainstream use and needs more development but I believe it'll will be worth way more when it does because "mainstream"
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:26:38
Or the hashrate drops and it becomes cheaper to mine
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:00:25
Google trends can be helpful sometimes
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:46:01
They will make money off transactions fees.  Even if fees are really low, if Bitcoin becomes global adopted then there will be far more transactions than there are now.  Also, if mining does become significantly less profitable then less people will mine and the difficulty will adjust accordingly.  It will all balance out
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:06:01
That's sort of the philosophy with bitcoin cash. Kind of a short term solution that makes assumptions that storage and bandwidth will scale with adoption. However, this has widely been determined to not be a viable solution for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:54:21
Okay now you're just being an idiot
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:17:03
This plus some exchanges like bittrex are lower because they trade against USDT, not USD
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:55:25
whatever floats your goat
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:16:14
If only we knew.  All I can say is its either going up or down.  I suggest you slowly invest it over the next few days that way your loses aren't so big if I does go down but your still getting in if the price goes up.  Either that or fuck it and go balls deep.  It could still go down but not drastically ( I hope )
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:24:43
im with you on that
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:57:58
Pretty sure they stopped accepting Bitcoin for some time now. They used to but ya, not related to China rumors
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:09:44
GDAX has no alt coin support and still charges a taker fee
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:36:39
Ya there is an influx of transactions and mempool is starting to fill up.  What fee did you pay? Looks like 100sat/b if you want your tx to go quickly
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:24:43
im with you on that
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:26:34
You mean the unrecognized IP that you have to confirm in your email?  You'll have to setup an IP whitelist in settings 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:54:05
ya not the greatest idea but Bittrex has better security than most exchanges
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:51:43
