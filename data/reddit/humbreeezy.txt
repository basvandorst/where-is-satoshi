This [Article]( from the SEC mentions some of the things I mentioned above. 
As for your second question, can you elaborate on what you mean by ‘purely technical perspective’?

Well in terms of volume, if Bitcoin was able to be used, I too would also agree that transaction time would increase. I think that one would be a no brainer for many to agree on. 
Although security, for me, is the one that worries me the most. The biggest question for the SEC will definitely be ‘Where is this money (Crypto) coming from?’ Because they aren’t able to track it, speculation will begin to happen. If speculation begins to start like a wildfire, I definitely think there would be more harsh regulations and limitations (in terms of trading with Bitcoin)
In terms of Processes, that’s honestly a hard question to ask... I’m thinking that the main thing that the SEC will do is definitely protect investors at all costs and prioritize security. But that’s just my perspective and analysis. We’ll honestly have to wait and see what the SEC would do if Bitcoin is one day allowed to be used in financial markets.

I’m pretty sure that’s the last thing the SEC would want. 
The words ‘decentralized’ and ‘unregulated’ give off an easy no from the SEC, especially if you’re gonna buy large quantities of stock with bitcoin...
Especially the recent SEC decision on that crypto ETF that caused crypto to dip... it’s a big sign saying crypto isn’t welcomed near any legitimate financial markets now, nor in the near future unfortunately.
