I did that when it was at 10k (cad) and sold at 15k but doesn’t look like it’ll drop that low again, might be best to buy a lump sum and forget about it

Each of my cards has a $250 limit, I have 2 verified id s, not sure if that helps or not but each card I use can spend $250 a week

So with that logic you shouldn’t buy BTC at all.. “stupid people buy btc when the price is high hoping that the price will rise even more” isn’t that why we are all here?
I’ll remember this comment for sure!

What’s your plan? Just keeping a few hundred in or are you buying quantity? I wouldn’t buy a wallet for a balance of a grand or less but that’s just me. Only keep in the exchange what you’re prepared to lose.

Hardware wallets example Trezor cost money, but if it’s not much or you don’t plan on putting a lot into it I wouldn’t get one, my 2 cents but I suggest doing some research before making any decisions

There is step by step instructions.

It gives you steps when you have a limit, ex take $250 out and then wait a month (basically if your card was stolen you’d hopefully in a month realize it’s stolen and being used on Coinbase) I’m almost at the end of my month wait after all my id has been verified, I’ll update with what my limit is after.
Worst case use a second card, or use your significant other and make an acc. You each get the referral $ which cancels the fee basically.
