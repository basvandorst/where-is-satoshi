Because theoretically, the market could be manipulated on 1/29 or 1/30 (BTC price) on other markets before settlement.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:59:17
No. Settlement is today (Friday). Final settlement is cash settled--on 1/31.

Just make sure that your bank account is verified and hooked into CB. Maybe sell a little bit of BTC ($20 or 20 EURO) and send to bank to "test" a deposit?

could be--maybe 7500, maybe 9500. I think if it goes too low (&lt;$7000), it will *really* scare the market and the manipulators would have scared away the entire market. They need the market to make money, so I doubt it will get hammered that hard.

Yea-after 3-6 months, most will know what to expect so the volatility will die off. I think a few large, well funded, fiat holders are buying the BTC dips and are holding for other, future BTC products.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:44:04
Nah, after 3-6 months, people will know what to expect. The BTC whales are losing their ability to manipulate (which is actually a good thing).

CME BTC Futures on 1/26.
Contract settles that day.
However, final settlement is 1/31--at London time. (if I am wrong here, someone let me know. I don't trade futures, just spent some time on CME site looking at contract specs.)
If I am correct on 1/31, 1/29 and 1/30 trading days should be very volatile.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:57:09

Yep. Perception, momentum, etc
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:38:23
Most "securities" (stock, bonds) are regulated by US gov't agencies (SEC, etc). CME and CBOE futures are "cash settled", so they are not actual commodities or securities being traded--so they are lightly regulated. 
Futures are "derivative" securities that give large BTC holders a way to "hedge" their current holdings OR speculate on the price of BTC. It is a brand new market, so no one really knows how it will, or wiill not, affect the overall crypto market. However, I believe that it is already affecting the BTC market and is being manipulated by Wall Street traders and/or BTC whales.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:54:10
Coinbase is fine. I have been using it since 2014. They are growing very very fast, so there have been some issues with scaling. However, it is a USA-based company, backed by US-basaed VC funds, and they comply with all US-based banking regulations.
If you are a new user and have not been verified, it may take a while. Be patient and I am sure they will get to you.

Depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Moving BTC to fiat to bank account--Coinbase is fine. If you are trying to do it anon, it's not. Don't bother using coinbase or any other platform if you are trying to skirt taxes, rules, etc.

Too logical. BTC whales going long on JAN futures to fk with Wall Street hedgies...
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:49:27
My opinion--at some point, market today might "slam" the BTC futures contract. That means hit it down hard for a short period. That is meant to scare weak hands and make (uninformed) people sell. Be patient if you can.

It's not that good a trade on apmex. They use bitpay prices--which can be off 5%-10% from market price. And, when trades are volatile, you could buy the gold at (what you think is) one BTC price, and by the time the "gold" trade settles, you could get credited with a much lower BTC price.

Silver market is stagnant and only flares up in times of stress. It's a deent holding, but you have to be able to sell quickly. Paper silver (silver equities) allows you to do this, but offloading physical silver, although it can be profitable, is a pain in the butt.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:43:09
That's because there is plenty of historical information to understand what other futures markets will do. BTC is brand new.

Meh. 
1.) End of year selling to lock in profits. Federal regulatory agencies are looking harder at people who do not pay taxes on large crypto gains--so many will actually report long term capital gains in 2017. 
2.) And--I think Wall Street is pushing price down. If ETFs are in the works, they want lower BTC prices in order to accumulate BTC. Once they have the BTC, they will push BTC up so as to get folks to invest in their ETF. Whala!

Send to Coinbase. If you send to GDAX, it actually goes to CB first, then offchain to GDAX. 
PRO TIP: Don't send to GDAX first--I did last Thursday when BTC was at $19,400...and the transaction is still pending. I also sent the same amount to CB--and it went through in 3 hours(but I missed the ATH).

It's about 3%-4% depending on the amount. BTC is swinging 10%-40% almost weekly--so in the grand scheme of things, if you are trading, it's not so bad.
GDAX is better for folks that know trading a bit better.

GDAX takes a fee as well--unless you are making a market (matching a buy/sell or sell/buy). If just buying or selling using market orders, they do charge a small fee. So, FYI.

@_date: 2018-05-27 19:03:13
I hear ya bro. You do know that most likely your entire life is already on the dark web? Kidding, but I have had other exchanges ask for it. Polo is now owned by Circle, which is USA based and backed by US VC funds. And, they are likely transitioning to an ATS or OTC exchange, so they will have to do this eventually. Doing it on a Sunday on a holiday weekend prob not the best choice. But, they will catch some folks who DO NOT want to be verified offguard, sooooo...

a limited number of shares of (anything) with cash pouring in is going to raise the price. I suppose you can by and sell it if you wish, but it seems to be not really correlated to BTC (my point). Its just another speculative instrument. Might as well just buy BTC on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:57:30
GBTC has not been given "permission" to be a full fledged ETF. They have a finite number of Bitcoins in their Treasury. Since they are not an ETF, they cannot create new "units" or "shares" when new cash is put into GBTC. The result is that all of the new money just drives up the price of the current BTC and/or units. 
Example: If you had one BTC in a wallet and it was worth $2000 when bought--and then all your friends wanted a piece of that BTC and gave you $8,000, that one BTC would now be theoretically worth $10,000.
Oh. forgot. If you buy into GBTC, I do not believe that you can sell your shares until GBTC tells you you can.

Pretty sure that once you buy the shares in this Trust, you cannot sell them again until the Trust allows you too. Grayscale also has an ETC Trust?

ETC Trust was pretty restrictive. I considered it, but decided against because of the lack of liquidity. Easier just to buy ETC on an exchange.
For the Trust, it's a fee and AUM business model. For the buyer, I suppose if the buyer can't be bothered to learn how to buy ETC (or BTC, LTC), then this might be a good fit.
