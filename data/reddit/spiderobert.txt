I don't even understand how anyone could think that ... I can understand people thinking it's a scam, but specifically a ponzi scheme? I'm not sure this teacher even knows what that means.

that infograph is misleading. In this situation Silk Road would have been "Alice". with Tor it doesn't matter if the destination isn't encrypted, it can't know what "Alice's" address is because it only communicated directly with the previous node. What happened with Silk Road is that they were making an unencrypted request for captchas *outside* of Tor

I swear he intentionally buys parts that won't quite fit so he can cut them. it's like every other video he's hacking something up :P

this poll is pretty much useless because it's overwhelmingly being taken by people who already support bitcoin.

regardless. people who use ZDNet are avid Technology fans. You don't think that would skew the results even a little? My point was simply that it's a bad sample.
