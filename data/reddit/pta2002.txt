Why not make it open source?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:57:32


Ethereum probably does that better than bitcoin (hopefully lightning makes the situation better)

They have refunded mine, maybe yours is good now?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:34:21
Because open source software builds trust. You can have a license that doesn't let people fork it if you don't want people 'stealing' your work, or one that requires any forks to be open source.

Well, it's not their intention, but the ETH token sure does look like one. It has value, can be mined and can be transfered from one wallet to another. What else do you need to classify it as a currency (and still classify bitcoin as one)?

Is it established enough already? I haven't been keeping up with it.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:59:17
What about transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:01:17
"only"

Here is the time I don't actually want to receive the money... But if he does win (*sigh*) count me in. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 08:45:15
Those aren't usable currencies though.
A main requirement to be a useful currency is to be stable. Bitcoin is anything but that. It's good for trading, sure, but very good as a currency when its value can change unpredictably overnight.
That and transaction fees (LN is getting there) are I think the main reason crypto isn't ready for mainstream adoption.

Over years, not over a month.

Have you confirmed your identity? You need to do that before you can withdraw. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 08:49:58
That's wrong. If it's backed by gold, for example, it's not Fiat money.
Fiat money is worth something because it's accepted it's worth something, unlike gold for example which is worth something because of scarcity among other things.

You can also easily step down the voltage with a transformer, something you can't really do efficiently with DC
@_date: 2016-11-29 11:50:31
Do these cost anything other than the bitcoin you load them with? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 19:08:53
Nearest one is 200km away :(

So... What are the alternatives besides coinbase? I have to use virtual credit cards from my bank as I don't have one, and they only allow one merchant per card, but coinbase uses two for some reason, so it doesn't work. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:56:52
The most well supported ones seem to be the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor. The trezor is slightly more expensive, but more usable IMO. I don't have any of them though, so don't take my word for it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:52:53
So you can shitpost about the bitcoin price?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:47:36
Not talking about this specific situation here, I agree that if you're running multiple nodes like this you're probably up to no good.
But if you want to accept bitcoin transactions, for example, the most reliable way to do it would be to run a node and hook onto bitcoind with the rpc interface. Block explorers need this too, they wouldn't work without a node. Most would do this on a VPS, as running your own physical server is often rather hard and expensive for small projects.
 What I mean is, there are definitely legitimate reasons to run nodes on a VPS. This isn't one of them.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:29:04
What if I want to run a bitcoin based service (a wallet, an exchange, a shop...)? Running a node is by far the most reliable way of connecting to the blockchain. There are legitimate uses for running a node on a VPS.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:44:35
Ah sorry, I misunderstood your comment. Yeah I agree with you, but it is suspicious when all of a sudden a ton of nodes pop up, all in the same IP range.

Where did you sell your bitcoin gold? I have ~$10 worth according to coinomi, but I can't find any exchange that will let me deposit it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:51:20
I have ran nodes on VPSs, mostly for bitcoin services that require the block chain (mostly wallets). It would also be likely that someone hosts a node on a server so they don't need to use their own storage, since the block chain is quite large.

Someone in another comment linked to a blog post on ledger about how they have the device sign a random string with their own private key that would only be there with the factory firmware, so if someone reflashed one and resold it, it wouldn't work.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:54:56
Thinking of getting a ledger, but right now I hold a fraction of mine on my phone for quick spending, and the rest on a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:37:14
How is that different from bitcoin gold? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:24:47
There are legitimate used to run nodes on a VPS. One example is if you wanted to run a bitcoin based service (like an exchange, a shop or a wallet, for example) and needed access to the block chain. Running a node would be the most reliable way of doing this.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:20:15
Yep! Bitcoin, credit card, or paypal.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:17:17
Maybe r/BitcoinBeginners?
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:00:17
But I don't see any problem in showing the total value. It can show how much you have in a set currency, then show individual wallets (though this can be hard to do on a hardware wallet with no connectivity)

I just meant that you can call emergency services even without being registered with a network, that's what emergency calls do even.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:55:04
Emergency numbers are always callable IIRC, even without any kind of sim card
