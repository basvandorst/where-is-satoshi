I created a facebook event here: 
The plan is to meet in front of the Apple store on Market street with signs, QR codes, and iPhones.

Can anybody find a non-WSJ link for this so not everyone has to sign in? I haven't found others reporting this yet.

The point is to raise awareness for bitcoin, and open source ideals. Apple has been going down a dangerous path of closed ecosystems. Their app store TOS represents a new kind of technology gatekeeper to innovation. It doesn't have to be this way.

Only in Australia. Not sure why that is.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:34:39
Sweet!! I was going to say, if you're using Swift, you should take a look at 
Looks like it's all objective-c though. How old-fashioned ;P
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:52:14
Sweet! I am thinking we should organize this as soon as possible while the news is fresh. Maybe next Friday or sometime next weekend.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:05:27
Correct. But you are missing the point entirely.
@_date: 2014-08-27 00:28:34
The wording is kind of vague. I'm honestly not sure if this applies to Bitcoin or not. Anyone have any background on the situation in India?
@_date: 2014-08-27 19:50:10
Satoshi created a hairball. It takes years sometimes to cleanup a codebase that has accumulated a lot of technical debt. It's not reasonable to just stop all feature development in the meantime.
@_date: 2014-08-27 19:39:10
Ah ic. I misread that. I guess I just restated what you said lol.
@_date: 2014-02-08 10:33:20
It is ridiculous, which is why we will get so much attention. I got the idea from protests that were done in the early days of Linux. Open source enthusiasts met in large groups to get a refund for the Windows software that came with their PCs.
@_date: 2014-02-08 10:27:33
The date is next Saturday at the Apple store on Market St. Please RSVP and continue to add ideas! This is going to be awesome! 
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:48:47
I am in the same boat!
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:44:42
Is it open source?
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:09:20
I hope you're not still using blockchain.info

In the pull-request to fix the bug ( there is detail given explaining how testing was in fact done, and why it wasn't possible to add an explicit unit test in the core codebase (yet). Satoshi gave the world a hairball of messy code, and there are large efforts underway to improve unit tests. It's slowly getting much better, but these things take time. Pull requests welcome!
Every developer introduces bugs, even with tests. It's the nature of software development. The key is to quickly identify, track, and resolve the important ones before release. You will observe that the developers did a very good job of doing exactly that in this case! :)
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:44:19
That also includes incoming connections.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:50:20
I think we can pull that off!
Our clear goal should be to show Apple that we want bitcoin apps in the store. I've been in the bitcoin scene for a while, I can ping a few reporters I've met and rally the local hardcore bitcoiners.

Wow this response is amazing! I am working on having t-shirts made for the event on Saturday. They will say something to the effect of "Distribute our bitcoin apps!". Or "Keep apps distributed!". Got any other ideas for the t-shirt slogan?
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:47:41
Nope. The default for outgoing connections is 8 and you shouldn't change that.
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:59:19
The idea is to protest their TOS, to be changed to allow bitcoin apps.
I already have a Nexus 5. I'll probably switch plans at some point, mostly because the apps on Android are getting more and more cool features.
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:46:45
The change was tested... Read the pull request comments. Le sigh. You guys...
Every developer misses things. Fixing bugs before release is part of any development process.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:03:03
Well said :)
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:54:29
That behavior as a company is exactly the underlying issue I am really upset about. The closed ecosystem. We are protesting for bitcoin, yes, but also for the exact same ideals that Richard Stallman and others instilled in us years ago during the rise of Linux. It is better for everyone to have an open ecosystem, and closed app stores are just another way of controlling information that should be freely available for everyone.
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:39:34
That is the point. We want to send and receive bitcoin on our iPhones.
You are right, but why did they leave it in the store for 2 years with the ability to send/receive payments? Did they just not notice in all that time?
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:04:59
Organize one in toronto! This doesn't have to SF only, but that is where I happen to live! If you do, let's coordinate so we can maximize the impact!
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:10:47
Exactly. I feel you. Keep it classy. We want positive attention for the open source community, especially considering bitcoin's portrayal sometimes in the press.
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:04:47
By default bitcoind only makes 8 outgoing connections. You can use the maxconnections flag to accept more incoming connections, but no matter what you're doing, you really shouldn't need to make more than 8 outgoing connections.

I think that quote is just referring to developers like the bitcoin core developers. Or the developers of apps like Mycelium wallet who just release software but don't actually hold bitcoin for you.
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:55:15
I haven't tried, but I believe it will. So at least there is that :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:36:19
I'm still confused. What were these exchanges using EgoPay for?
@_date: 2016-03-04 01:28:28
I mean... If the blocks are full SOMEBODY's transactions aren't going to get in. No matter what. This is self-evident. So no, you can't just increase your fees.
@_date: 2016-03-09 01:11:39
Close your eyes and picture 10 people at their computers who happen to buy something on overstock.com at the same time.
However, let's say that the block size limits the whole network to just 5 payments every 10 minutes (to keep it simple).
NO MATTER WHAT FEES THEY PAY, 5 OF THOSE PEOPLE'S TRANSACTIONS AREN'T GETTING IN FOR A LOONNNG TIME
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:46:52
Mike Hearn has a great explanation of why you're facing troubles with Bitcoin. The network has been busier and busier lately but hasn't been upgraded to handle the increasing scale. You can expect long wait times whenever you send transactions on the Bitcoin network. That is normal now.
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:13:28
I'm well aware of the research going on for off-chain solutions, but they are all years away from being viable. In the meantime you're going to keep seeing growing delays, and a worse and worse user experience for everyone 
@_date: 2015-02-28 05:03:19
All linuxes are not the same... We're talking about Gentoo here... I'm going to go out on a limb here and claim that compiling your OS from scratch will never attract mainstream users.
@_date: 2013-02-18 05:23:56
Have bitcoin apps gotten shut down in the Apple store in the past?
@_date: 2013-06-10 06:04:46
Ahaha this is amazing. The password-recovery social engineering is priceless.
@_date: 2013-02-19 09:16:47
There's no way to turn it off currently. If you don't mind me asking, why is it hard to read on your screen? Do you have a dark-colored desktop background?
@_date: 2013-02-18 05:10:45
It fades in whenever the price changes to give a visual indication that there is a new price. As long as it isn't red, it's updating live.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:41:11
Been waiting for Patrick Murck to talk this whole time!
