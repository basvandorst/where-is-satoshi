Revenue is not profit. Did he account for the cost of the launch?

Thank you SO much for taking the time to explain. I found this very useful.
Follow up question: as I understand it, one can set a fee (in this case, coinbase set it for me). Could someone set a fee so low that it would literally never be processed? Or would it just take like a week or whatever? From your explanation, I'd imagine that it'd never get processed as long as there are other transactions in the queue with a higher fee. 
I also feel a bit validated and honestly won't be buying anything else with Bitcoin. Someone else can pay the early adopter fee.

My exact situation was, when buying a Christmas tree, guy was like "half off if you use Bitcoin" so I was like, hey, I have Bitcoin and how can I not pass up a half-off deal? So I opened coinbase app and transacted. Then after I got home I saw that my half-off discount evaporated.
How am I supposed to transact in the future to avoid fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:29:45
How do I do that? Is there an app that you recommend? 
And how do I get Bitcoin from Coinbase to a wallet without a similar fee? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:43:04
I don't understand. Do I need to buy more Bitcoin using dollars from airbitz? Or can I move my Bitcoin from Coinbase? If the latter, is there a similar fee? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:25
This is the welcoming environment that makes Bitcoin readily adoptable by the general public and totally worth its valuation.

The price of freedom sucks. What would make people want to use this as a real currency? This is literally prohibitively expensive. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:29:11
what does this mean in terms of the price?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:48:30
What could I have done differently when buying my Christmas tree to avoid a 76% fee? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:08:11
but why though? What's special about January 3rd?
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:30:25
Thank you very much.

Is this even profitable? I mean the upfront investment alone for constructing the warehouse and purchasing all of the equipment, in addition the operating costs of the electricity, maintenance, and cooling seems like it'd just be enormous. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 03:12:38
but you *did* need a phone like to operate internet.

i found another 'glitch' in the survey, this is common among surveys though. for 'how many bitcoins do you own' many numbers fall into two categories. for instance, I own exactly 1 bitcoin, do I select 0.1-1.0 or 1.0-10? Same if you own 10, 100, 1000, etc...

Thelonious Monkfish! yes! even a killer name.
p.s. I live in Boston, and I've never seen a place that takes Bitcoin

They're legally obligated to make money for their shareholders.

ok, say down the road, well after I have 4 confirmations, what's stopping me then?
Also, if I can buy with Visa/MC instantly, then this can just work in the other direction with the opposite price differential (I don't see why that would never happen)- buying from Circle, selling to Coinbase.

seriously, it's always bothered me that the "answers" don't actually answer the "questions"

This is going to get canceled due to the snow anyway. Even if it doesn't I doubt many people will show.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:19:03
Noob here. Could you explain  a bit?
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:32:29
why would you need a couple thousand in cash? Write a check.
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:16:26
can I give you Bitcoin and get cash out?
Sometimes I find myself with my phone but without my wallet. It'd be nice to be able to hit up an ATM.
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:40:22
what's up with these posts about everyone ditching these things?
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:09:45
Can anyone confirm that this works? Have you received BTC? 
Also, if I'm getting bitcoin, why do they need my email address in the contact info? 
@_date: 2014-07-22 18:50:50
care to send me one?
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:31:48
Please. I haven't been inside of a bank in years and I do just fine.
Direct deposit, ATMs, check deposits with my phone, online transfers, etc, etc. Why would I ever need to talk to a teller?

I was trying to avoid details, but I'm paying for [adfreetime]( so I can watch the Red Sox on mlb.tv in the blacked out region.
It finally confirmed and I caught the last few innings. But it's a montly service, so I'm set until next month.
Now that I know it takes an hour, i can plan accordingly.
@_date: 2015-04-10 03:15:52
I'm not contacting them. the business in question is [adfreetime]( if you're interested in contacting them.
I don't know what bitpay is. I scanned a qr code with my phone.

I do this every month. But I write my landlord's name on a little slip and how much money I want to send him. Then I drop it in the mailbox on my way to work.
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:38:08
well, i'm sure you'd be happy to know that I'm literally spending $2.
@_date: 2015-10-21 18:02:43
and instant.
and the money can be sent to others using google wallet or spent with a debit card.
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:59:35
It's not new. My roommates and I have been splitting expenses like this for well over a year. It's awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:51:27
ok. but the basic problem persists.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:49:14
This is absolutely ridiculous. First of all, in any realistic, day-to-day sense of 'using only bitcoin', it's totally irrelevant if i'm not getting paid in bitcoin. How can I be sure I can afford my rent if I'm getting paid in dollars, and spending bitcoin when I don't know one day to the next how much bitcoin i'll have?
secondly, the scenario the author uses to justify living only on bitcoin is just ridiculous. If you're "being investigated by the FBI or NSA or ATF" and "They freeze all your assets", you'd be stuck with whatever bitcoin you happen to already have, you couldn't buy more (because your assets are frozen). and buying an international plane ticket just wouldn't work. even if you *bought* the plane ticket, you'd still have to use your passport, and then the FBI or whatever would have you nailed.
and lastly, it's the French Riv**i**era, not the Rivera. You should know how to spell the place you're headed if you're on the lam.
