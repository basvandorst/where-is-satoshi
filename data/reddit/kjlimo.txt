Very fair point; but seeing them talk about it at the C suite level is nice progress.

Very cool to see Mastercard CFO discussing crypto!

You can be the next!

Yep, I'm going to leverage off of this success to convince other services to be the first in their city to accept bitcoins!
@_date: 2012-02-18 11:44:27
Rock on!  This is exactly what the bitcoin community needs.  People spending bitcoins!

Leave me a comment with your Villages name and send some hearts to Jonathan Ryan Owens mentioning Monty sent you!

Agreed.  They will need to advance the system when it picks up.
My thought is that they would generate a new address each time an order is placed.  This requires some coding, but hopefully someone out there can do this for them.
That way the address is only provided to the single customer and GrubGo can confirm who pays as well as it works automatically as a receipt 
For now, I'm sure they aren't worried about a million people using bitcoin.... Let's start making them!

Do you have any food delivery services near where you live?  If so, please let me know &amp; I will call them to share the success of GrubGo.
Who knows, maybe they will start accepting bitcoins too?
@_date: 2012-03-09 05:09:15
Awesome ending!

New address has 6 more transactions, so that's 8 orders for GrubGo via bitcoin.  We'll see where it goes!
@_date: 2012-04-02 10:43:45
doubt what's really true?  The whole article?  Please be more specific...

Not sure a mobile wallet is for you then... you might want to stick to USD bills. Or barter.

I was able to get my neighbor to pay me back with bitcoin using this. I only accept paybacks in bitcoin!

You don't have to use the contact feature... I have not given DropBit access to my contact list yet either and it works just fine.

1). Aiming for Q1 of 2019 for international support. It all depends on texting fees in other countries.

The market will decide what it decides.  Feel free to talk all you want, but I'm not worried...

You can see the version history in the app store, and look on their website to realize the app wasn't just released today. They have been working on it for a while. Just looking to expand the user base and get more feedback. My neighbor isn't familiar with bitcoin (but their husband is) which was the point of my post. Newbies can figure it out and send bitcoin to your phone number... if that's not a feature you need, then move on.

They need to take another picture of the CEO Mauro; not because it's a bad pic or anything.  It's just I've seen this pic used a few times.  I'd like to see an updated one.

Max argues that bitcoin will force the banking system to reinvent itself or die, for what can be more of an invisible hand but a cryptologically guarded, invisible currency. In the second half, Max talks to Glaswegian comedian, Frankie Boyle, about Scottish independence, Boris Johnson, the mainstream media, being semi-banned from the BBC and about George Osborne's Help to Buy housing scheme being like eating toilet tissue while trapped in a loveless marriage caused by negative equity.

nothing too surprising here...

Good article
@_date: 2013-05-28 15:13:31
Excellent point; people need to make sure they are legal before proceeding.  Tough in the short term, but rewarding in the long term

There will continue to be misinformation for years, especially with the emergence of alt coins.  We'll need to help correct peoples misinformation one person at a time...

I wonder if they will update their website to say the units will be 30 GH / 60 GH, or if that's still too preliminary to talk about...
@_date: 2013-05-28 03:58:52
Not too surprising given the media attention over the past two months.

I assume the shipping e-mail it some auto-generated e-mail once they remove your order from processing.  I doubt you'll get anything delivered...

Wonder if they would invest in my bitcoin mining company I'm starting up... haha not like there aren't a million of those already... :)
