growing pains. Me= 30+ buys in 10 days, no failures, withdrawals post to bank 2~3 days later (slow, yes). coin rolling in as we speak. 5 sends to private wallet at normal fees (~a buck). Each confirmed in 20min. Coinbase is charging too much for fees, but look at it this way. They'll invest that money into their infrastructure and we'll all laugh about this at that bar in Malta.

So here's the punchline: They're finding out that no matter how much weight they throw around, the price always corrects and adds more of us to the formula. They're facilitating their own abandonment. And that keeps me warm inside.

this law would attempt to register every person trading bitcoin, down to the person. NOT A CHANCE.

First country to nuke its fiat for cryptocoins will likely inherit an unfathomable amount of wealth fleeing the global crash. Singapore has balls (balls in soup!).
