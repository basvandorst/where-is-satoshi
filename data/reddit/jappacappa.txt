Thanks, but that was an attempt at a joke. As in with should all stop mentioning Bcash :P
@_date: 2018-08-16 07:32:58
WTF is Bcash? some sort of toilet paper or something?

Don't ruin this with logical statements like that. Bull run will begin, we will all get rich and drive lambos next month. period.

I have the same feeling. Lots of people came to me asking to buy during the last bull run. They have all lost hope, sold or forgotten about it. Only real believers are left and they are not selling. Not at these prices anyway. Now it starts to feel like the buying opportunity of a lifetime again. 
The next bull run will be even greater and this time more regulation, more and better exchanges, segwit and lightning will allow for small fees and fast transactions even when the new buying frenzy are at its peek.

Since I sold at that time, I would be kind of an ass if I recommend them to buy at the same time as I sold.. 
But people have a big ego, they are sure they are right and are going to get rich. Telling me they are going to invest in some shit coin, because bitcoin is not even risky enough. You can't say, "yeah, I just made 600&amp; return, but you are too late, you'll just lose all your money".

Everyone was so sure they were going to get rich, no matter what I would have said they would still have bought. 
worst part is I really thought about the whole "when the taxi driver starts talking about stocks it's time to sell" idea, but was to greedy to sell that much... Hopefully I have learned from my mistake

That people that came to me and asked if they should buy bitcoin in november - desember, the same people are now asking if they should sell. 
My advice is to buy when the average guy want to sell and sell when the average guy wants to buy. 
Now is the time to buy more.

It's a super simple protocol, http is not alive, ftp is not alive and bitcoin is not alive. Jesus...

Very good point. The main reason Bitcoin is the most valuable coin, is because it has been stress-tested for ten years and somehow has never stopped processing up to 100.000 transactions per day. It has proven again and again to be very robust.
Lighting network will experience the same thing and become more robust and secure every day.

I had a wallet, 4 years later I hadn't used the password for for 4 years and it took me a long time to crack the password. 
It's much more likely to lose your bitcoins by locking yourself out, then some hackers breaking into your computer.

Next step, lightning on top of your full node!

Every single person the last 10 years that invested in BTC and held has made a lot of money. Only people that invested in BTC in desember 2017 until now has potentially lost money. It's only been a couple of months...

A very expensive DOS attack, since you do have to pay a fee for each transaction you spam the network with when it's added. And a traceable DOS attack since you use your wallet to add transactions.

just about every bank has been hacked, had downtime, maintenance etc. Some have gone bankrupt, some countries have lost the pensions of millions people. 
I have been locked out of my bank plenty of times.

tons of people use your mom and she is still a joke

Lets see the source code

yeah, I'll just give up friends, family, all hobbies and take up a huge loan so I can do everything on this list.. Great idea idiot

I present to you a few days with a real graphic card:
@_date: 2013-05-22 12:25:49
maybe we can actually start using it for buying and selling now. Not just currency trading and long time saving hoping the value will rise. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 09:15:30
 fuck you
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:30:56
when did you order?

I meant a dedicated card and not one build into the main board as on the raspberry pi, but radeon hd 7850 by shapphire specifically.
