It really isn't a mystery.
You should also be aware that the NSA's *real* job (outside of spying) is encryption/decryption and communication technology. It's the NSA that is responsible for the abilities of American security technology first and foremost.
I won't say they've got their hands clean, but the NSA does actually try to produce useful technologies for the good of the US. SHA-256 wasn't designed expressly for Bitcoin; heck, it hails back to 2005. [SHA-256 is used in a pretty wide range of applications.](

SHA256 is not a program. It cannot run independently on a computer like a program. 
SHA256 is conceptually similar to a Ceaser Cipher, if you know what that is.
EDIT: I also want to point out this gem of a statement:


Coming from the guy who is incapable of differentiating a software bug (Heartbleed) from a full functioning Strong AI, yet is so willing to pass off his belief as fact. 
Cryptography isn't my field, but machine learning *is*. I am *telling you with absolute confidence* that there is no Strong AI pulling the strings in Bitcoin. I am telling you that there is no way SHA256 can be used for anything other than cryptography.

That's like being scared of 2+2=4. 
Yeah, a post singularity program (or a Strong AI from my side of the fence) would probably use 2+2=4 in some way. Does that mean we should be afraid of it?
SHA-256 isn't a power grab tool. It's not a weapon. It's not a code breaker. It's a math equation. I really cannot hammer that point enough.

Which is non-existant technology as of now. Strong AI is a level of computational ability that humanity has not yet reached.

I'm confused, is this not the Bitcoin media sphere?
I don't see this stuff talked about at all outside of @_date: 2014-05-09 13:48:07
100%.

I'm not saying shit about BTC. I'm personally guessing that BTC has 50/50 chance of surviving the next five years without some massive hole being discovered. I don't put much faith in it.
What I *am* talking about is SHA-256. It is *a math equation*. It is not software, it is not a program, it is not an algorithm that is within itself nefarious. We are talking about something that is closer to 2+2=4 than to a program.
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:31:38
Because the picture is much smaller than what you've apparently got stuck in your head.
To you, SHA-256 and Bitcoin in general is a black box. You know next to nothing about how they work, who built them, and how they can be used.
I am telling you right now, *people know how these work*. People designed both, for god sake, it's not like we just found them in a desert somewhere. This isn't observational science, it's mathematics. We built these, and the education needed to build this is rather standard across the board.

Ok, give me reason to believe the NSA intentionally sabotaged their own encryption algorithm for the sake of mining an, at the time, completely useless and frankly ridiculous crypto-currency?
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:07:42
Sorry for crushing your far fetched dreams. I've always believed reality is far more interesting.
@_date: 2014-05-07 03:08:59
Do you even know what SHA-256 *is*?
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:14:22
Yes. The National Security Agency (NSA). It was designed as an encryption standard and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
It's an encryption/decryption algorithm, similar to the Ceaser Cypher, Burrows-Wheeler transformation, and many other encryption/decryption tools.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:56:26
Or he knows how to read a spec. If SHA256 can be used to create an AI, why the hell are we using it to mine bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-05-10 01:02:17
And that's nothing more than fear of something people don't understand. 
Welcome to the digital world. The rate at which things will be created that you do not understand will forever increase from here forward.

As a gamer who lost his R9 390 Nitro to a power surge last week, you coin miners have been making my life miserable.
All I want is a replacement GPU to play some vidya, but I can't afford even a direct replacement of my card because the prices went fucking haywire. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:21:37
No kidding. If my 390 was still working I could've sold it for like $500 last week.
