of course

Why has no one noticed that Mircea is not actually threatening Andreas, but is explaining in a blunt way why privilege in Bitcoin is unlikely to go away (you would have to take BTC away from large holders, of which Mircea is, by force)

Actually many comets actually have tails that are moving in the direction the comet is moving. In fact, IIRC, this may be the majority of comets. 
And on TA, it consistently works for me.

really? obviously was just to pump the price
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:43:50
It actually doesn't much, as unconfirmed transactions are the same, and 1 confirmation in BTC is as secure as 4 confirmations in LTC
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:39:13
why don't you stop being so arrogant and have some sympathy for those who are feeling terrible
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:21:18
Well obviously, but only now has it reached an extreme. Under a shady pool too. Yes it is never only one factor, TA said we were a little overextended. But the real factor has shown its ugly head

I don't know why people talk like this about Mircea, He's never actually done anything (harmful)
@_date: 2014-06-10 03:30:19
Just do some research into various Altcoins please? yes some are pump and dumps but you sound as if you haven't looked into many of them...

vote fuzzing to protect against bots, posts with more than 75% are unlikely to have a significant amount of downvotes

Thank you for posting this. It is important we all remain vigilant, in our investing and our health. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:54:14
If you don't have the willpower, you shouldn't be involved with Bitcoin.

The price started dropping exactly when Ghash reached about 46% and cumulated at 51%
@_date: 2014-02-23 23:59:59
keeps trying to pump it... He should give up already, the market is already saturated with this news

As others have said, LTC seems to not really be innovative. People are trying out other coins for a strong spot, like DRK (although that may be instamined) and more recently CRYPT... Litecoin mostly just has first mover and network effect
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:27:00
yeah its kinda modern / cyberpunky with little resemblance to kid/toy like web 2.0 graphics
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:31:23
right, a ton compared to other things... for example gold is under 1%...
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:24:52
3600 coins are produced each day. These coins must be spent for extensive miner costs, to which in reality little of their expenses can be paid in Bitcoin (and if so, those who accept it likely have it exchanged to Dollars). I recently looked at some of these numbers, I think at least 1800 BTC are dumped on exchanges each day, maybe more. 
Its important to remember Bitcoin is still very inflationary.

In addition to Maidsafe, I believe Datacoin also has this feature

Ghash owns most of their hashpower as they simply rent what they have out and spend that on more miners
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:31:49
And Andreas still won't explain why many Altcoins have been destroyed by 51% attacks...
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:06:46
In theory, this isn't even an issue, at that price it would cost almost 1 Million USD to put that much data in the Blockchain
@_date: 2014-09-23 05:59:53
Could either hit bottom around 350, or hit 300/260. not lower, unless if no new momentum picks up. It is actually possible for it to go back up, but at least months off I think. The danger is a low price will discourage people, by that time things like apple pay filling the niche Bitcoin has enjoyed so far. we shall see
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:28:46
ok thats what we are telling ourselves
@_date: 2014-06-10 03:23:00
Overall, this is not true. Yes some have been swept aside without resistance, but the majority have been destroyed from an outside actor with massive hashpower and money to burn destroying the network and currency. 
For examples etc, look at Bitcoinexpress on btctalk
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:09:42
You certainly live up to your name. Most Bitcoin goods and services accept 0 confirm transactions, through either the payment provider taking the risk or simply it being very unlikely to get a low value transaction double spent. 7.5 min = not even as secure as 1 BTC confirmation
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:22:04
its also gold...
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:12:19
This has been an ongoing reaction since ~650. This is significant, even for Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:28:02
Bidders need US bank account, although that probably isn't too difficult for a savvy investor
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:36:40
btcdrak isn't a troll, your posts do seem a bit more on the pathos and surface side of things (seems not saying they are) I think this is what drak is getting a bit of a vibe of
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:26:28
There is some reality to this - at and below ~200 will force miners to capitulate, threatening the entire ecosystem. This could put bitcoin into a vicious cycle culminating in a death spiral. we shall see.

agreed. This censorship also probably works for XT which is interesting...
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:55:52
more than 70% are upvoting, and he seems to be saying what everyone already suspects...

What about people like Wladimir? He doesn't seem to be involved, yet he is vehemently against XT and radically changing the blocksize right now.

I admire Gavin and his sentiments but lets not degrade to glowing faces of ego worship, just the words is better imo. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 20:54:31
is this bullish or bearish. I forget at this point
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:44:12
Wonderful seeing Bitcoin reach across the globe to inspire those who seem like they might be uninterested in digital currency.
Hope the rest of your holidays are great, Gavin. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:42:50
Unfortunate I have been downvoted, as everything I have written is verifiable and true
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:40:47
To explain, Litecoin is being accepted as the silver equivalent to Bitcoin's gold. 
This is supported by overall consensus, even the Bitcoin Foundation has openly stated this.
However Litecoin is definitely in a bubble, and is downtrending. 
Other Altcoins are indeed being pumped, and are in bubbles of their own. However I wouldn't jump to extreme manipulation so fast, as there has been much mainstream press recently about Altcoins.

Back in the day users on this subreddit went out and talked to the protestors about Bitcoin. They seemed interested and receptive, I hope some of them got in. 
But as mentioned below I do not think as a whole they care much about BTC. Too bad because they often claim 'banksters' being the root of the problems...
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:34:32
I just tried the PPA from Bitcoin.org - it seems to be down. I'm hoping this is a temporary issue.
