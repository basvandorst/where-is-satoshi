Quite irrelevant but yes
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:11:16
Darn you lucky bastard! :D 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:42:07
Just advice

The fact of the matter is you did not lose money. You are merely a person that hasn't invested into bitcoin at all. Essentially you are at the stage I was at just two days ago. Make peace with yourself 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:49:01
You're assuming that bitcoin follows a trend, which we can not be sure of. Would be great though if it goes that way! HODL, brothers! 
PS: please use the title as a title, e.g "Thoughts on Dec-18 BTC forecast". 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:07:21
Yesss good idea
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:35:36
Awaiting my deposit to go through to GDAX via Coinbase via Revolut but it's slow af and may just deal with Coinbase fees! BOP AND KEEP IT DIPPIN, HODL, let's go to the mooooooooon
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:32:55
Worth buying in this dip then? I'll watch it for now, I'm hodling and this is a better price than any of my purchases. I did say if it crashes I'll hodl and buy more and see what happens to BTC for at least two years and just hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:42:36
THIS 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:40:16
Yes I see that too. My father is a ForEx trader for 35 years now and he is hodling now but says he won't buy in this dip as he will rather wait to see how the market reacts in the new year. I'm conflicted but may put in £50 on this dip just for safesake :)

Hi, please point me on the correct path of what is best to buy BTC from and all that. I've been watching bitcoin for the past six months and realised I should have invested earlier. Only investing an amount that won't hurt my livelihood if it's lost.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:05:54
That's very nice of you! Wish I was in US or Canada right now, haha. Merry Christmas
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:54:23
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:40:38
I'll post what worked for me soon
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:03:20
^ this
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:50:49
I missed it when it was in $15!!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:31:04
Okay so you're saying you've put well over $500 into cryptocurrency so far despite not verifying identity? Did you do this all in one quick swoop? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:36:40
Guys I really want to invest ASAP but I don't know quite what this seed stuff and all is. I plan on using gdax too, and will purchase only like $300 of BTC and transfer it to the offline wallet if that must be done.. please advise

I don't know enough about it, but I've wondered recently if quantum computing would cause a significant increase in mining rate. Thus, as here mentioned, more coins being added refers to addition at rates that were previously seen. Stability is lost, just the same as if a country starts printing shitloads of cash
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:21:03
Hi Swinny. I'm 21 so I only recently got out of the problem you're facing. You will need full access to an account that will allow for free deposit and withdrawal of money. Think about it, you could basically get a wallet online by having someone make it for you and you take control over it. You could have someone buy you BTC by giving them cash. However, what happens once you have your BTC? You need to be able to transfer the BTC funds into cash unless you're adamant that no matter what you'll HODL. If you have no bank account, you have no way of exchanging your BTC unless you utilise it to purchase goods. 
I may be wrong, but I think these reasons would likely mean asking your parents or a close elder to do the investment with you. I would offer you help, but even if I were to charge you in doing so, you will still only be holding the BTC so it would not be a good decision. Hopefully someone in this thread comes up with something. I've heard of temporary online debit card accounts you can purchase that are not linked to a real bank account. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:54:04
Perhaps give Revolut a try. Check out for more info. I'd help but busy rn
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:54:06
Hi. Appreciate your reply to the post. Please can you help me a little.
I am going to do a transfer to GDAX asap. I'm in UK. Where can I learn about the offline wallet? Also, if I transfer money today to GDAX, will I be able to manage that account and everything whilst I am abroad in South Africa? 
When you transfer to GDAX does it immediately convert to BTC or does it hold your money transferred and wait for you to convert it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:43:10
Please set me on the path to start holding BTC. I wanna put in like $300 and just sit on it over Christmas. Will truly appreciate it, just wanna join the community
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:56:19
The problem is WHEN to buy before the dip turns into a "grow" hehe
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:42:19
Did you just see this tho
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:14:06
Thank you very much! I appreciate this. 
In fact I am actually going to be doing this with my father who has worked in currency exchange for 30+ years so he knows that side of it all and I'm supposed to be the tech! 
Do you just hold your BTC on this coinbase? And isn't coinbase the same thing as GDAX because I just went to GDAX to sign up and I'm getting stuff from coinbase and I just uploaded the ID
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:30:35
If there's the chance of one bitcoin on one of the drives just sit down for one evening and search
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:59:24
Don't regret the unprecedented
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:51:08
I won't even bother reading the post. Catch user's attention by using the title as a title.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:52:24
I'm confused why you're doing this for $2. If you're trying to test the withdrawal from Coinbase, deposit like $10 more at least to pay the fees
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:38:47
Are you then trying to get your cash back and get out of the investment? I ask because I'm trying to find how I can help
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:33:12
Have you all tried ID verification straight from the actual app instead of in chrome? Please let me know if you've still had trouble through the app
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:57
Hold buddy. No point in selling now..

I just read it as 'Its time for plan' because I didn't recognize it as a 'B' but rather bitcoin. 
Took me a few seconds. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:19:40
Very busy with uni, can anyone please give me a tl;dr on why bitcoin's dropped, what this lightning is and what it can mean for bitcoin? Pleeeaase
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:12:34
Good reply, thank you
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:05:17
Lol 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:50:32
What do you mean to unload?
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:53:39
So you'd rather a person buys bitcoin once it's hit a drop and leave it alone through its gains and drops in the hope (and seeming likelihood) of its value to net positive?
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:29:20
Pfff just print it
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:25:53
I'm trying but waiting on revolut transfer!
