Oh my god, I got it!!!
Thanks so much for showing me that program!
.15BTC recovered =~ $2500 Woo!

Thank you very much!
One follow up question: Do you think this transaction has much of a chance of getting confirmed at 44.248 sat/B?

Hmm... So I guess my best bet is to just wait two weeks until it drops, export my private key into a new wallet instead of sending it through the blockchain.
Could I do a replace by fee? (I don't think MultiBit Classic supports that.)
Do transaction accelerators work? I think btc.com has one that costs around 75 bucks. 
Thanks again for all the info. Very helpful.

The program seems really cool. I was using JohnTheRipper before to create my password list, but this is much better.
I tried my first run with about 10 or so words in my token.txt file, but it starts counting passwords up to like 15,000 then hits my max limit (168 hours) and exits. 
Should I increase my limit or do I have too many words in my token file? 
 Thanks for the help!

Hey, the program seems to be working well. I didn't use any wildcards because I think I know what numbers are in the password.
I'm pretty sure it's a combination of all my parents pets names and a certain 4 digit number they use for lots of things. So I'm trying just a token file of the pets names and the number that I'm fairly sure is in it. It's working on some 3 million or so passwords right now on 4 worker threads. ETA is like 2.5 days.
If it's not the pets' names then I have a few other ideas of what I might have made it. So I'll just switch up the token file and try again.

Really? That's very disheartening. Even the recovered.key file is probably a false positive? I guess I'll give the other program a shot. Thanks!
edit: I tried deleting the password that was throwing a success and it did indeed throw another success on a different password... so that script does throw false positives. Aint that a kick in the head.
