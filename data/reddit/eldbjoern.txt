Ok, because currently I have some btc already and want to pay for a service. But they say like ”60min” remaining. So I guess the transaction has to be confirmed in those 60min?

ok thanks. So would there be a way to change the wallet app to an app which supports Segwit woithout sending the money around?

But I think you need a valid Swiss phone number. Otherwise you can not buy Bitcoins.

Can somebody explain me how this chart should be interpreted? Or how its called?

Ok, first of, the QR scanner is at the worst position under the screen. this means you are tilting your phone around a lot till the sensor can read it.
Second you need to enter a phone number on which you will receive a code you have to enter before you will receive any money.
The time delay is not that bad.
Im not sure about the fee they take, but if you get Bitcoins for about 20.- (swiss francs) you'll receive about 17-18.-
The phone number is to limit the max you can buy per year.

I thought it is 1k per year, but I am not sure.
According to the webpage per purchase you can buy between 20 - 500 swiss francs.
You need a swiss mobile phone number.
The seller is SweePay
