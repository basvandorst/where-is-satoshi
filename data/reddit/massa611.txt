I thought it was really funny.

Fair enough.  Yeah i have been / are currently "wrong" as it seems, but i suppose what im trying to say is im not convinced its gonna be an "investment" any time soon.  People talk about Bitcoin as if it were an investment, but i see it as speculation close to gambling.
I might stick £100 into bitcoin and Ethereum as a gamble, justin case it has another big bull run, but i expect to ultimately lose that £100.

Thats the second time someones said Hodl.  I guess its Hold On for Dear Life?
Ive been put off by the amount of hype around bitcoin, and the amount of misguided kids (and adults) talking about it like a get rich quick scheme.  
Combined with that is that im not convinced of Bitcoins usefulness as a stable currency in the long long long term.  
You kind folks have given me a lot to read tonight, thank you.

Thanks for making the first reasonable and constructive reply!

Super enthusiastic.  Well im not convinced yet but you and a few others have left a lot for me to read so i can reconsider.
A friend recently made a good point.  He reminded me that i thought smartphones / touchscreens would be a fad.  Maybe i should stfu and dump a large amount into Bitcoin while the price seems to have dropped

Use in illicit transactions doesnt make it a good investment at all, so i dont feel that proved me wrong.  Most people are saying its value is being decentralised, mitigates inflation (despite being super volatile)  so im still not convinced.  I posted this in case i misunderstood or was missing something.

I dont get what you mean.  Is it just that Bitcoin can be used for buying illicit stuff?
