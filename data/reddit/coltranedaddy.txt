Does anyone know the selling interest (shorting) on the newly-introduced futures?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:06:08
Well then, let us know NOW what you intend to buy tomorrow :)

Wait a few more weeks when the sharks are swimming around that lineup... Crowds will thin :)

I find it funny that a bitcoin investment plan still relates all gains/losses to the almighty fiat dollar...
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:50:45
What is the figure for the US dollar, please?

Whales HAVE btc, they hodled for years and are happy to cash in whether at 20k or 5k. They have so much to sell that they play the "let the market recover" waiting game. And talk about how it will hit 500k while selling every uptick...

It's non-counterfeitable and hence a potential store of value. And it's famous and hence again a store of value. I play(ed) WOW, everybody who had *some* gold bought that thing called "haunted memento". Why? Because you could always resell it anywhere on any realm.  The current volatility is due to the fact that nobody has figured out the math for a store of value. It's a lot like the option markets before Black and Scholes. But some day someone will, and you'll see all the crypto prices converge and settle down. Take my word on it :)

If you haven't understood what finance did to any commodity, maybe you will now. Paper gold, silver, wheat, sugar, etc. trades order of magnitudes more volume than the underlying physical matter. Nobody ever asks to be delivered, and hence the paper markets are free to set the price. When bitcoin had its big rush a year ago the finance sharks opened BTC future exchanges, and that was the end of it. BTC is now tightly regulated, not in the meaning of government rules, but in the engineering meaning of say steam pressure being regulated by the Watt valve. The net effect is what you are seeing now: BTC stuck in a narrow range (6-6.5 k$), and alignment with general markets. You never really thought a new yorker billionnaire was going to drain the swamp that bred him, did you?

Every fork is heresy! Burn'm I say :)

Give it to your heirs free of death tax while you can still trade BTC anonymously...

Wowww, double top on the recovery in a downwards trend... Getting ready to buy yet lower in a couple days :)

Bets on the future market influence the prices on the future markets, and then people who have large assets can arbitrage the cash price (your exchange price) against the future price (the bets). That's called "cash and carry" or "reverse cash and carry" depending on which one you do (sell or buy the actual bitcoin and take the opposite position on the future market).  By taking these actions on the actual cash market (your exchange), these people move the price of the two markets closer. This keeps going until the prices are virtually the same, since there is no risk money to be earned as long as there remains a difference in price.  
So because of C&amp;C and RC&amp;C, the cash vs. future prices can only differ by a tiny fraction.  That fraction actually corresponds to the cost of financing, over the time period that separates the day of arbitrage from the settlement day of the future.  But basically, you can count on it, arbitragers WILL align prices to the same level across different exchanges, markets, futures, etc.

*I had to wait for my money to get to coinbase*
Mwahhh hahhh hahhh... I feel your pain... Nothing to do but laugh.  10 years from now we'll look back and be appalled at coinbase. What a bunch of cooks they are!

When you dine with the devil, take a long spoon. Same with Coinbase.

Really??? That would be an increase in total energy!  How did you discover perpetual movement?

Even though I'm a hodler myself, I have to point out the fallacy in your argument. The pressure of diminishing supply may be balanced by an equal or superior pressure of diminishing demand...

They exist to protect all people from misinformation. If they did not exist, mass media moguls would own every financial market in the world. Oh, wait...

Greed got me, I was waiting for 4k to buy some more, now I'll only have to enjoy my current smaller hodlings...
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:47:45
If you haven't noticed, every rebound occurs with diminishingly high volumes. And the current floor does not even coincide with a volume increase. Looks like a hodler capitulation to me. Nobody in their right mind will buy today when they can wait a few weeks and get it at 4K :(
