It's possible. Ordered my nephew parts for a computer build with it yesterday. It may have been more popular than Newegg predicted.

Those JPEG repair applications are usually pretty limited on what they can repair. It's usually header fixes or bypassing missing chunks to allow the image to be viewable. They wouldn't work for your files as analyzing your files in a hex editor revealed there was nothing inside of them (every byte was 0). 
Recuva and other recovery software works a bit different. It usually scans the entire drive/card/whatever and looks for data. It has the ability to find JPEG headers/data without an actual file link if the link was destroyed by say deleting it. This is pretty simplistic view of how it works, but you get the idea.
Sounds like the issue may be in retrieving the images from your phone and not the microSD card if the images are still working on the phone. I never had an issue with transferring files via USB, there has been a few times I needed to tweak file names when transferring them with an application over a wireless network ([Airdroid]( for example), but it still never produced the correct file size with no contained data.

It looks like it is a Block Erupter which will only mine SHA256 so you would be limited to what coins you could actually mine. The bad news is most [most multipools mining SHA256]( show Bitcoin as the most profitable coin. So you would be just mining Bitcoin anyways and with this miner it would likely be at a loss.

Isn't that the original NewEgg Bitcoin promotion? That's not even the right discount or promo code for the current offering.

The person uploading the images apparently bought them off the hacker using Bitcoin. The leaker was accepting Bitcoin, but hasn't received very much.
[This was the address]( I saw go up and it may belong to the leaker.
[This one was posted a little more recent]( I'm not 100% on that one either.
The people posting this 40k nonsense is because someone linked the address with a space in it. They copy and pasted the address into blockchain.info and got an error message. On that screen they saw the recent transaction window going crazy and [saw this]( and thought it was going to the leaker. The previous image posted is theirs

It just shows that the coin is small enough to rollback with only the developers and a few exchanges leading the way. If the coin had mass marketplace adoption, there would be a total meltdown right now and I don't know if they could truly stop the attacker from leaving with everything. It will be interesting to hear how or why the attacker was able to steal over 8 million Vericoin from MintPal. That is around 30% of all the Vericoins that exist. 
MintPal suggested they were paying other exchanges for their losses when they do the rollback. At the current rate at the time of network halt it looks like those 8 million coins would've been worth 3120 BTC so I could see why.

I took a look at your files ([Virus Total results for the paranoid]( ) and the only files that contain any data are the ones that already work.

The rest of the images contain absolutely no data. They are all zero filled.
There is only one video file that contains any data as well.

At a glance it doesn't appear that much of the data is still there. It's 113 MB outside of the .zip and 20 MB inside. Unless Pied Piper was behind this compression I'd guess that most of it too is not there.
Have you tried to run any recovery software on the MicroSD card? There is a slim chance something like [Recuva]( might find something. If the card is completely corrupted it may not find anything, worth a shot.
Sorry man.

I'd say most GPU miners were just leaving Scrypt coins as ASICs are more common. It was either try to sell your rig or find something else to mine. Profit GPU mining is getting harder to find, but you can still find a nice coin once in a while. My problem is how much maintenance I have to put into it to keep it profitable. I mined Scrypt for around half a year and maybe changed a setting once or twice. The past two months I've mined Scrypt-N, X11 and then later X11 with an optimized kernel, X13 and then also with an optimized kernel, X15, and then a miner that optimized AMD 14.6 drivers that produced a little better hash rate, and finally mining Nist5 off and on this week. It's getting a little strange.

It pulls data from : 
I made some very quick Python code using Requests. This was done lazily and I'm not pulling info out of a post and instead hardcoded the example. Just a quick example.
    import requests
    data = requests.get("
    print data['data']['meme_name']
    print data['data']['top_text']
    print data['data']['bottom_text']
That pretty much does it.

About 4 months ago someone was switching various Altcoin miners to their own pool. It was said to have used the "client.reconnect" command, but I never heard any follow up on it. [Most of the mining software]( put an option to disable that option in their config files.

Sometimes apps are only really relying on the OS to hide the data from other apps. If you grant a malicious app the privilege of accessing the data it can try and obtain the stored information. I could guess that people using their phones to backup information (Titanium Backup and other phone backup apps) and storing it on sdcard would also give malicious apps the opportunity to try and grab information without needing root access.
At the same time root access gives you access to tools to prevent these apps from gaining these permissions or using the network to pass it on.

I don't ever really check this sub anymore, 3 years ago I was getting excited when the price fluctuated $14 to $17. Then it went down a few dollars and the 300 inspired hodl images would spring up. 
[I would be okay at buying at this price again.]( (closest buy I have to exactly 3 years ago).
