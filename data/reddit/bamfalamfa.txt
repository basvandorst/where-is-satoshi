the enterprise ethereum alliance is a known entity. blockchain as a technology is going to be embraced (most likely), it is to the benefits of many governments/corporations to embrace it. the concern is with the overvaluation of bitcoin, which was certainly overbought/used as a mechanism for rich elite chinese to store their wealth in a digital asset. that is what caused the insane price increase in just a few months. it was talked about for a while that the chinese were going to move their wealth to digital assets. the chinese government isnt concerned about a bunch of farmers putting their money into digital currencies, its the wealthy elite that makes the government genuinely fear capital flight

yeah bitcoin was most likely overbought. this is the first time the price has been this high so obviously the china rumors should be taken somewhat seriously. in the past it was peanuts, but now with actual large value the government has to pay attention and control it before it gets out of hand. there will definitely be a price correction

yeah what about it though
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:15:14
its possible a ban or at least massive regulations might be coming because this is the first time the price has been this high. especially with the price spiking up essentially in just this year alone, china would be afraid of capital flight. they have to control it before it gets out of hand. china only does two things: control something or kill it. a price correction is definitely coming regardless of a ban because bitcoin was overbought
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:08:27

@_date: 2017-09-09 03:51:22

i believe that adoption of crypto will be the result of embracing technology. from bartering, to carrying metal pieces, to paper money, the eventual move to digital assets/currencies is the next logical step. whether bitcoin, ethereum, or some single world government issued coin is what will go to dominate the space, who knows.

alright Neo, take off your shades and calm down. you cant just say buzzwords and tell people they dont understand. this is no way to increase the wider appeal of bitcoin/crypto and have it adopted by the general public, you know the driving force for "legitimizing" bitcoin. unless you want bitcoin to be used by like 1000 people and not be adopted anywhere else. i understand what you mean when you say that the project will have failed if the state gets involved. but honestly, digital currencies as a concept will be used by a government, which government and how powerful they will become on the global stage is what matters

yes. whatever the chinese say, they dont give a fuck about grandma or some random farmer putting their life's savings into bitcoin and being scammed. they are afraid of the rich elites who are putting their wealth into a digital currency to get away from government control. THAT is capital flight, not some pitiful savings of a chinese farmer. the ridiculous surge from $600 to $5000 was because of chinese elites storing their wealth into bitcoin, not because of some belief in blockchain
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:25:29
it was started out for outlaws, or rather people who wanted freedom from the "system". but now that its gotten popular, people are excited about it going mainstream and being adopted by the wider population. this, obviously, comes with several issues mainly concerning the safety of people's assets in what is essentially the wild west of finance. even though crypto adopters want "normal" people to use bitcoin/crypto, they refuse to address any of the concerns that keep crypto in such a speculative volatile state. they kind of just want the project to work

there are millions of users. what do you mean when you say nobody because i genuinely think the vast majority of users dont know or care. i might be wrong, but if a change is that stealthy i think only 10% of the redditors of r/bitcoin will freak out

because at that point buying so little its no longer investing. if at $25k you buy $100 worth of bitcoin, it would require bitcoin to hit $50k for you to double your "investment" just to get $200. it no longer becomes investment and becomes a storage of wealth

i think its because people are preparing for the chaos of november

Do people not commit fraud with bitcoin?
