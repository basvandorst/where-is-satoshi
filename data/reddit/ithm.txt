So, if I'm understanding correctly, to own a bitcoin means to have the key for those bitcoins?

Very cool, thanks. So when I'm using a public server like coinbase, I'm basically trusting they dont give away my private key? It seems like I can only see my public key.
I'm assuming if I generate it on my own computer, then I would have both the private and public key?

I guess I'm asking a more specific question. What does "validity of your transaction" mean? Whats the difference between a real transaction and a fake one that I send to the miners?

No, I want to pay with real money and not give away any personal information.

If I use a service like this  to create my wallet, how do I know they also dont have access to my wallet? What if I put money into it, how do I know they arent going to take that money out?

Who decides that a transaction is valid? e.g. I send you a bitcoin, who decides that it goes in the ledger?

I dont understand what a blockchain is, and therefore have no idea whether I would feel like downloading it. It sounds like it's a record of all transactions, which makes me wonder why anyone would want it?

If my wallet is my file, what prevents me from modifying my file to make it look like I have more bitcoins? Or is there a central server that handles this stuff?
