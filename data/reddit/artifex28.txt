Once again. If Mt. Gox is under gag order, they could not tell anything else but "lost bitcoins". As the customers lost access to their Bitcoins.
Since the Bitcoins are where they are supposed to be, it really seems the Bitcoins are seized pending investigation. This means, a court order can release them - or parts of them - eventually.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:36:05
No one can. Ever.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:08:59
It's really starting to seem they tried to steal the coins and blame "hacks" for it.
At some point people managed to find the coins and now they were "forced to admit" that they actually got them.
*But the rest we don't have, really!!*
...until someone finds them. 
*Oh, how lucky! We had few hundred thousand here too!*

Shouldn't hurt someone who loses minimal portion of their wealth compared to people losing 50 to 100%.
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:44:43
They are letting the 100k€ out daily which is the current SEPA withdraw limit for all Gox-customers together.
Why there's such limit, I've no idea. Perhaps it has something to do with money laundering laws.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:05:11
The risk that people were expecting was:
1) Downtime.
2) Hot wallet hacks.
3) Legislation issues.
Not a multi year (should be impossible) leeching via cold wallet (should be impossible), without accounting (should be impossible).
The only fault lies with Mt. Gox. Not the customers.
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:50:23
Anyone know how the withdraws on the USD side are going?
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:10:49
Yes, I posted about a friend getting his SEPA withdraw on 25th of February too which he initiated on 4th of January.
However, I made a SEPA withdraw 7 days later (11th of January) and I have NOT received that.
Anyways. Very glad to see that some people at least get something out.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:48:11
Bidding doesn't mean the company actually gets sold.
Few months back, a Finnish company, Tiimari (194 stores around Finland and Beltic) with long history (1975 -&gt;) selling crafting materials, papers, cards was to be sold. There were more than 10 bidders / potential buyers, but it still bankrupted.
Now we better hope for that classic white knight swooping in and saving the day.

What an awesome reply! So Bitcoin advocates, eg. Falkvinge should stay the f*ck out of Bitcoin.
First stop would have been 1) Proper code. 2) Hot wallet is meant to be isolated from cold storage. 3) Accounting.
All these failings together was a scenario I gave the chance of 0.00000000001% happening. If they indeed lost the cold storage funds that is.

Every single missing BTC, must be accounted for - showing "it was stolen here". Just saying that won't do. They have to show the mutated transactions etc.
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:45:51
I only remember getting errors, when I tried to withdraw DOLLARS to SEPA accounts. You need to sell BTCs to euros before you can make a SEPA withdraw.
Mt. Gox cannot act as a money exchange, AFAIK. This was one of the reasons their Dwolla related funds got seized and are currently frozen. They actually might even get them back, as Karpeles has at least given the right answers on the interviews.
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:08:16

It all comes to a very simple equation:

I lost 40 BTC and $5k.     
                   
Naturally wouldn't mind seeing some of that over the next ...10000 years it would probably take them to account for 850k+ BTCs.
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:36:14

Uhm, it's far from that simple.
Wars have opposing sides. By donating money to either side, you are helping them out.

@_date: 2014-03-01 21:38:04
Think software licenses for example. You do not own the software, but yet you possess it. You own RIGHTS to use something, which doesn't mean you actually OWN it.
Same applies to cars and such. When you buy a car, you actually gain three rights with it.
1) Right to modify
2) Right to resell
3) Right to use
...but you do NOT own the car. At least this is how Finnish legislation works.
You cannot claim the "engine is yours", find how it works - and start manufacturing the engines or similar cars yourself.

And this is how Japanese legislation works?
EU = All companies must submit public numbers at least in some form                          
US &amp; NZ = Privately held companies do not have to?                         
JP = ???
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:16:22
I can see two reasons behind this.
1) They had pretty terrible Twitter page, with some of the support tickets public there.
2) Pure market manipulation. It looks like they want to drive the Mt. Gox value down, probably stocking the BTC so they got enough when they open the withdraws - no matter how limited.

It's the Ukrainians vs Russian invasion.
Kriml was part of Soviet Union until 1954, when it was donated by Nikita K (supposedly drunk) to Ukraine. And now they are "getting it back". Kriml has high amount of Russians living in there.
I've seen some pictures of Ukrainians looking for Bitcoin donations.

At least in EU, banks have some sort of money laundering -laws. If you try to withdraw or deposit large amounts of cash, bank HAS to (in Finland) ask *"where the money is from?"* and *"what are you using the money for?"*
But that's just talks. You do not have to prove anything. They just add whatever you say to their system.
I asked my bank if they are following bank transactions (Nordea) considering Bitcoins or such and they said: *"Absolutely no."*
I also asked if they have to forward info about large money movements to tax office or similar authority. Yet again they said: *"Absolutely no."*
@_date: 2014-02-22 02:09:47
Did you have to cancel it at some point? Eg. made multiple smaller ones -&gt; then cancelled and made a larger withdrawal?
This happened to me in October when I wasn't aware of the 20day limitation they have. Support from Gox asked me to cancel my 1k withdrawals and make one larger to avoid that, when I was trying to find out why I wasn't getting my repeated withdrawals I made day by day - after the first one that is.
That resets your place in the queue.

@_date: 2014-03-29 22:20:31
Currently the exchanges validate and verify their users.
Same would happen here, but now as the banks would play ball with Bitcoins, they would move the fiat from buyer A to seller B.
Thinking forward, it would work like this:
Banks would greet Bitcoin and become exchanges eventually. Moving fiat around shouldn't be an issue at that point.
On transition phase however, we'd need something like this:
**Module A for FIAT only Banks:** Exchanges data with module B. Allows banks to add new buy/sell orders to catalog (module B).
**Module B for Catalog servers** -- Catalog of all the buy/sell orders. Communicates with modules A and C.
**Module C for non-bank exchanges (actors with fiat movement restrictions)** -- Adds data to module B, located on catalog server(s).

@_date: 2014-02-27 19:30:38
No, there's a difference. Banks are working via FCR, even generating new money 9:1. Meaning for every million they have, the banks can loan 9 million more forward.
Fractional means they are holding or owed the money. They just do not have it liquid at all times. Just a fraction, where the name comes from.
In Ponzi the money does not exist before someone steps in. It's a completely different thing.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:46:01

@_date: 2014-02-27 20:57:02
Not really.
In there, they point:
*Gox was robbed of a massive amount of coins (800k+) at some prior point in time, possibly June 2011, and has been operating a fractional reserve since.*
Which simply isn't true. Antonopoulos, Falkvinge and plenty of others have discussed that even on technical level.
@_date: 2014-02-22 22:53:16
So it seems that SEPA work, but there are some serious issues with dollar ones?
Are there different types of dollar withdrawals or just one?
I know there's the one with 5% fee and some sort of priority. But generally, I've no idea what are the options. Wire transfer? Withdrawal to bank account? What else?
I am 99.9% certain, that if you have account in US, your withdrawals are slower than rest of the "dollar accepting" areas. After all the Dwolla $5 million seizure of funds from Mt. Gox was exactly via that - Mt. Gox is not registered as a money transmitter in US. That means they cannot exchange hard currencies (you cannot withdraw dollars to euros and other way around).
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:59:11
I think I do understand at least the basics.
However, I don't see where my thought process fails here.
I am throwing ideas left and right though, so most probably I am thinking past an obvious mistake somewhere.
Let me emphasis - we do not have to do any changes to the current miner network.
What we'd actually need here is bank &lt;-&gt; catalog &lt;-&gt; exchange implementation (search for software module A).

I share your thoughts.
The draft was sent for potential buyers / companies they were looking to bailout.

Details are important. Always!
I don't see how the NFC is an issue here.
User has 1000 mBTC on their wallet A (storage). 
User has a NFC card, that allows (card/bank restriction - naturally wallets won't limit anything, but the software which you use to move the bitcoins could. After all I am talking about wide spread acceptance of Bitcoin which means Apple-type usability) storage of 50 mBTC in wallet B. 
User moves 50mBTC from their wallet A to the NFC wallet B. 
Wallet A has 950mBTC. NFC Wallet B has 50mBTC. 
User swipes NFC card and spends 10mBTC from wallet B. 
All data is on blockchain. 
Yeah, AFAIK banks use Kobol mostly.

I really hope Mt. Gox would give us a timeline for opening the withdraws, no matter how limited, soon.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:34:11
Falkvinge, have you considered the possibility of a gag order? This would explain why their PR side has been absolutely terrible.
Notice that they have said the coins are "lost", not stolen.
Mt. Gox allowed anonymous trading earlier on and to me it seems that Feds have seized the funds pending investigation as the funds are directly linked to Silk Road.
I lost 40 BTC and 3500 euros, most of my earthly posessions, which I do not believe I'll see again.

I don't think it's the government they are expecting to bail them out.
Instead Karpeles is thinking that Mt. Gox is too big to fail and that the repercussions from that would be too severe for Bitcoin if (IMO when) they go bankrupt. 
If however, a bailout actually happens, I would claim that the reason is, at least partly, some sort of "Bitcoinial unity". To show the world that the community is willing to help those whom have been stabbed in the back by Mt.Gox. Naturally the investors would look for a profitable business too, but would probably accept less in terms of profit...unless it's a true surprise like Google or Paypal, which I don't even consider to be a real possibility.
Think of the billions paid for WhatsApp. Price tag of 0.5-1 billion for Mt. Gox isn't necessarily too steep, considering the customer base and progress made.
Anyways, my odds for the future of Mt. Gox are:
90% Insolvent. Bankruptcy.                                            
4% Insolvent. Buyer is found, but only for tech.     
4% Solvent. Buyer is found. Customer funds are paid back via fees.                           
2% Solvent. Buyer is found and customers gain access to their funds.

I am not trying to convince anyone of anything.
Just thought I'd give a status update. That's all.
EDIT: So many people asked for this so -&gt; 
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:39:17
Yeah, as we can see from the value of Bitcoin.
...oh wait.
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:25:48
Fiat is fiat and Bitcoins are Bitcoins. Obviously you use fiat to buy the Bitcoins.
Currently, banks are needed to move fiat around.
Banks aren't stabilizing the price, but the single source of buy/sell orders would be.
This way, every user can find out that they are actually selling/buying with the best price available. Currently the price of Bitcoins tend to vary from isolated exchange to another. If someone sells 100k BTC on "market sell" price on Bitstamp, I don't even know if there would be enough buy orders.
BUT, if there was a catalog service that would split that 100k BTC "market sell" order to ALL linked exchanges, the seller would get the best possible "buy order" prices from all the linked exchanges. Instead of Bitstamp hitting $0, all the exchanges would go down eg. 10%.
What I am trying to do here, is to build a realistic scenario how to mature Bitcoins. Something we actually might see.
If you except the banks to die, you're dead wrong. :p

a) I don't want to spend the BTCs, while I expect them to raise.
b) I know two vendors in whole Helsinki where one can use BTCs. Both are restaurants.

I don't see how this is an issue. Moving Bitcoins, means moving Bitcoins from Wallet A to Wallet B.
Bitcoins are always marked somewhere.
We are obviously talking about different things here. :)
On my example, NFC was just a way to increase acceptance. Easy of use, that's all. I am a visionary, you see!
When you have a wallet on NFC and user swipes it, the amount of Bitcoins are transferred from the wallet on the NFC card to the wallet on the reader.
The offline wallet (NFC card wallet) is 'being brought online' on the reader. Reader creates a new 'request wallet' that asks for eg. 10mBTC, sends a request for the user for a bitcoin transaction of X mBTC, which user then accepts with the password linked to that wallet. In this case it could be just a PIN. After that, the Bitcoins are transferred from the NFC wallet to the 'request wallet'. As soon as the sum is received, all is good.
The card reader itself would be part of the infrastructure, supplied by the bank/NFC card author as well.

Probably seized due money laundering laws / Dwolla-case (Money Transmitter -case).

It depends on the contract, really.

@_date: 2014-03-29 22:10:38
Edit later on: Maybe we should keep the miners out of this one...
Old text below
An exchange or a core service that would work on the bitcoin protocol -level.
Currently the miners are holding the ledgers.
Would it be possible to harness the current miner network or portions of it to handle buy/sell orders?
A single source of buy/sell orders or at least a way to share the buy/sell orders over the mining network.
Data convergence is slow on the P2P-level, but it might be possible to at least exchange some of the buy/sell orders between exchanges. Maybe. No idea. :&gt;

You're correct on the speculating side there. Then again, a lucky guess about one's thoughts is still a good tell. Now you certainly know what I think on banks on that matter. :-)
Web is already full of Bitcoin comparison sites.
I was throwing out the '10 year plan for Bitcoin' how to mature. A realistic one instead of pure utopia.
And on that matter, the banks (actors moving fiat) are crucial.

Does it?
Getting 10% profit/month?
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:35:56
Why? Just sharing my thoughts.
The exchanges act as REAL honeypots. There's a potentially chest of gold to be found, so I presume that plenty of more or less talented hackers try their 'luck', going through their known tool-/skillset.
And as we can see - apparently some manage. You don't see banks being robbed for 5 million dollars very often. And the chance of getting caught is naturally minimal online.
On top, no violence - and you get to sit still in your boxers if you so choose.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:41:22
Then again, you quite can't call it currency as there are countries that do not consider Bitcoin a currency. :)

There are changes to the protocol upcoming. eg. increasing the block size. So how's that not against everything what Bitcoin is? :)
Changes occur. The only question I asked was if it's actually technically possible (aka realistic, eg. the same way increasing block size).
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:10:44
To my knowledge the 200k BTCs appeared after people managed to track them and point out that "they aren't lost after all".
To me it seemed like an inside job from the start with someone failing epicly with the 200k BTCs.
"Oops, I forgot to hide these."
Now the interesting thing is - will they manage to recover some...
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:25:59
So in theory, we could see a client for the miners eventually, that has a voting system implemented.
eg. "News flash! 19k BTC stolen from Bitstamp!"
"Would you like to participate in freezing these stolen assets?"
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:44:23
Step 5: Write cynical guides while super annoyed to boost own ego. :D
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:24:16
But could the protocol itself contain the functionality for freezing the coins. At that point the only thing required is the *decision* of preventing transactions with those coins, freezing them in the wallets they're in.
But who'd be the authority making that decision? Vote from the miners, started by the same "authorities" suggesting/making the changes to the protocol in the first place (eg. increasing block size)?
Obviously the freezing should only occur when an exchange is breached, but who's to say when an exchange is actually breached?
@_date: 2015-01-16 10:55:50
Well, no need to wonder anymore who did the inside job or leaked info about it. :p
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:14:41
There have been (meaning I don't know if there has been) OR there will be changes to the protocol - eg. increasing block size. What's to say that the same "source" wouldn't act as the "authority"?
Central authority isn't needed. Just a public vote, started by an authority that can in general suggest changes to the protocol itself.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:20:49
Well, in few days it's going to be the same. :D
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:57:50
This might been the CAUSE of the issue in the first place.
They thought they had all that currency (as they should), but instead they cannot locate it?
I REALLY hope I am wrong here...
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:28:34

Sure, I'll try it out. :)
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:25:54
This started it all.
Read the rest of the announcements from the pages.
TL;DR; People are afraid and selling their Bitcoins on Gox, because they currently cannot withdraw them out before Gox manages to fix the problem. It's a valid issue, not a scam of any sort, although Gox should have reacted on 2011 or so when they were warned about the transaction malleability issue.
People selling their BTC feel that in case Gox goes bankrupt, their euros or dollars would be considered more valid than Bitcoins in court so that they actually might see some of their money eventually.
I personally think Gox will manage to recover eventually.
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:29:38
But the question was COULD it be done? Meaning technical side, not the philosophical.
Also, unless you created Bitcoin yourself, how could you know what was the main motive for creating it?
And while there might be some statement from the time Bitcoin was 'born', who's to say that it couldn't change over time? :)
Very few things in general are completely black and white.

People are getting rouhgly **21.84%** of their accepted value back.
**Amount of bitcoin held:** 202,185 XBT or $91,185,435 USD (27.5. value)
 
**Total claims accepted:** $417,436,518
**Edit:** Heard somewhere the trustee might hold roughly 9 million in dollars too, which would mean roughly **24%** return. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:07:21
I've a question about Mt. Gox.
The trustee in bankcruptcy has informed people that the claim processes would start this spring.
Roughly 20% of the Bitcoins are known to still exist, but has there been any talks of FIAT?
When people leave their claims, do you think that FIAT will be prioritized over Bitcoins? Meaning if people had FIAT "in transfer", would people see those sums prioritized?
@_date: 2016-05-27 21:38:32
The fiat was counted on the 24%.

Remember workers, your effort is greatly appreciated!
In 2011, JPMorgan made DAILY profit of $52.6 million dollar in Q4 of 2010. Those are the public numbers, which they'd pay taxes from (naturally located on tax exempt areas, but that's a different story). They naturally can press that profit number as "low as they need to", with various purchases and acquisitions.
Lets presume JPMorgans part is 10% of that 5200 billion/day market. That'd leave them 520 billion to play tricks around daily. Lets presume they generate profit of 0.125% of that amount per/day via "clever trading".
That'd leave them a profit of 750 million/day. And that's just one part of their business.
Anyways, we at JPMorgan would like to extend our our warm greetings to the billion+ people living with dollar or less per day!

Hah, thanks! Although I have no idea how to ...claim your generous tip! :)
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:00:07
There are few important points of interest that you IMO shrug/skip.
1) BTC Stacked people SELLING are "converting" to HOLD/BUY people, with LESS BTCs.
2) As there are LESS BTCs in circulation, the impact on one seller is ever smaller - while the market cap keeps growing (at least it has this far, as we can see from the current exchange rate) This stabilizes the Bitcoin more and more, the longer the exchange rate "holds", as long as there are Bitcoins traded. This eventually leads to new purchases, as we can see from the exchange queues.
3) There are numerous types of new buyers.
a) Some are daytraders / quick sellers. They benefit from the volatility/spread. Their impact can considered neutral, although they are the first to sell if a dip is coming. In that way they can be considered negative effect for the exchange rate of Bitcoin.
b) Some invest just a little, for a future. "I don't really mind losing this money, but it seems like a good idea investing the 100$, in case it's hundred folded eventually." Their impact can be considered very high, since they are the long term keepers.
c) Some invest larger sums for smaller percentual win. Impact: positive.
d) Some don't invest at all, but actually guard their savings from a bigger unknown - the banks in Cyprus, Spain etc... They are partially "forced" to use Bitcoin, and their impact can be considered neutral, as no one can really know long they are staying "in the game".
e) Some invest huge sums, for a long time. Impact: Positive.
f) Some invest for the sake of an idea. After all Bitcoin IS a great idea. Quick, anonymous Internet currency that is. Call it a kickstarting of some sort.
So what we can see from here, is that we have multiple types of people investing on Bitcoin, driving the value up. We have investors whom have mediocre to great expectations. There really aren't any real downsides currently. The panicking has stopped around 15-20% every single time (weekly), when the daytrades have sold their savings superquick to make at least some profit. Then again, there have been DDoS attacks/flooding to cause lag/unavailability, which makes the daytrades really edgy.
