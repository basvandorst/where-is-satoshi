The  Twitter handle is basically attacking Bitcoin and shilling BCash.
It's like Coca-Cola's social media manager leaving Coke to work at Pepsi and using the Coca-Cola's twitter account to tweet about how much Coke sucks and Pepsi is better.

I agree. I hate the comparison too but the truth is that those who are anti-Bitcoin often make this comparison.
All this does is highlight that EVEN if they are right about a bursting bubble, the market is still only a fraction of it's potential.
Many of the greatest and most influential companies of the century were formed during the "Dotcom Bubble" and I believe that some of the next greatest are being formed now in the Blockchain Market.
The Internet is now a huge part of our lives, like Blockchain will be in the future.

lol it's called whatever people call it, sometimes you don't get to pick your name you've just gotta deal with it.
Bcash is absolute trash anyway

My friend spent 22 Bitcoin on the DarkNet on drugs over 2014-16. Didn’t even get that much. Expensive habit.

Very true. Just wanted to show that a big mid January dip is very normal.
2015 Jan 13-14th = -43%
2016 Jan 8-16th = -22%
2017 Jan 5-11th = -32%
2018 Jan 7-16th = -35%

It's not particularly solid but if you can base the value of internet/tech companies on the number of internet users.
If you compare the Blockchain Market to the Dotcom Bubble it often gets compared to. Even if it is a similar bubble it could still grow 50x before it burst and would still be 20x larger than it is now after it crashed.
Just a thought.
