It´s dumber to assume and not contribute at all to the thread. 
Can`t use BTC to pay for rent, services or food in my country and I have currently no other source of income, hence the question, need to sell BTC in USD to make a living and keep most of the BTC in my wallet.
Any ideas? or did you just want to call people dumb?

I’m from Costa Rica by the way.

Thank you kind stranger! I will. Appreciate your response.

This sounds promising, though I´ll probably wait until there are reviews and the service works well, as there´s usually turmoil when a service is launched. Thanks!

Will do, thanks man.
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:17:20
I’ll try to do that.

Has anyone used a debit card like Bitpay outside US?

You sure are fun at parties man. Looking at your history, that’s all you do, insult people, mental health issues huh? It’s great that you can use BTC as curency right now, and when mass adoption comes you’ll be in a great place, you seeem to be an expert in the matter. People could use your advice, but you sure aren’t interested in helping.

I see, thanks.

You know, that’s a great idea, I guess I can negotiate with the landlord and I’m researching if there are any businesses accepting BTC.
The bitcoin was created to be used as currency, hope adoption keeps growing fast.

I have sent them an email, but buy/sell is not available in my country yet in Coinbase, it wouldn´t even open itunes in my phone to download the Coinbase Card app, FAQ doesn´t really specify so I sent support an email.
Thanks for the tip.

Yes, but what if it is my only source of income? It’s a full time job.
