But is it? When you can actually use it to buy stuff like sausages and shoes? isn't like saying dollars have no value because it is just paper, specially now that there is no gold standard?
I ask out of genuine curiosity.

Isn't it good news that Bitcoin remained relatively stable after news like this? Should a true currency be affected by which payment provider supports it?

How much would you donate if you cold use Bitcoins? I can donate via PayPal in your name and you can pay me with Bitcons, or not pay me, I don't care.

That's because you use them as intended, not as an unregulated casino game.

I would say the average person has no idea what fiat currency really is, much less what a cryptocurrency is. You may try to explain it but to them it looks just like the video. I think they main problem is that people don't understand what Bitcoin *is for*, because the media has misrepresented a lot: it was not meant to be used primarily to buy illegal things or to trade it into a bubble, yet those are the two things the media keeps repeating save few exceptions.

Why does it have mirrors? Isn't it supposed to have some tiny cameras instead?

But doesn't Bitcoin gain some value as its use is more widespread? I mean when it began it had less use than tissue paper and therefore less value but now you can use it to buy tissue paper so it must mean it did gain some value as a thing?

Yeah and about not trading bitcoin I found myself falling into madness, all of these years I've been watching bitcoin I was thrilled because of the reality of an independent currency "by the people for the people" and I wanted to buy into that great plan, then suddenly I found myself worrying about buying low and selling high and crap like that... fortunately I was too lazy to do it.

Yes, I don't care about the USD/BTC rate. I said I was caught into the trading madness but ultimately came out from it and that I think it was wrong getting caught in it.
I just find it ironic that you have to disclose so much information.

Why do people keep using Mt. Gox, aren't there like tens of sites? Why is Mt. Gox so important?
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:58:02
Right, makes sense. Would a meta-trading site work to avoid this monopolization assuming it was technically feasible?

Thanks again. I'm not that big into anonymity but I'm definitely no fan of giving out my personal information with proof.
Bitfloor looks just like what I expected from all the bitcoin traders.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:16:33
Right, that also makes sense. I think it would be a great thing if it happened.

That's a way to put it, it's dark but I have to agree.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:19:42
No, I've got nothing to hide. It was laziness, not principle what prevented me from giving them my information.
But last time I checked I didn't have to give the bank my social security number to buy a dollar.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:13:17
Great! Thanks for that.
