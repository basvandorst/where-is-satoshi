It's not so much that it's backed by a military, it's more that everyone relies on it to survive and operate. If a currency "Collapses", it's generally very bad for the global economy. Especially major currencies.

Hindsight is always 20/20. 
I started mining a few years back, but gave up quickly because the cost of electricity was pretty close to what I was gaining. I ended up losing my wallet (recently found .002 bits in an earlier one I backed up, I'm gonna be rich!), but if I had kept up mining I'd have had a few hundred or (very) low thousands by now. But hey, at the time I made the more or less correct choice for me. 
I mean there's always the pizza guy story, if you wanna feel better about yourself. 
What matters is making the correct decision in the moment, and sometimes that can leave you kicking yourself in the future. I mean what would've been better at the time? Losing *all* your money when the companies go under, or getting a few hundred dollars back out before they do? 
Edit: and honestly, Apple's stock really didn't take back off like this till 7 years later when they announced the iPhone. Unless you wanted to have 1000 "worthless" or average growth shares for 7 years, you didn't mess up too badly. But again, hindsight is always 20/20, and a bitch.

Hahaha... Oh god...

It's two fold, people spending it gives it value, but people also buying it gives it value. 
And at this point with how BTC is always going up, people are buying simply on the hopes of it continuing to go up. 
There's a balance to be had, but if you have too many people  simply buying to "get rich quick", it will eventually collapse when none of them spend it.

Yes and if anyone had stopped to think about that for more than 5 minutes they'd have realized how fucking stupid of a slogan that was. 
What exactly made america greater in the past than it was/is now? Sure America was more or less the most powerful country and economy in the world. But it still is. People had more purchasing power and you could make a career out of almost anything, but you can't do much about that because all the developing countries that were leeched off of are also starting to develop. All the amazing social services and such back then were paid for with insane tax rates. Or is it because they could be openly "bigoted" and get away with it if you were the right gender and color... 
The slogan is dumb and makes very little sense if you think about it. 
But hey that's just the state of the country I guess.

You do realize people can leave Monaco, right? It's also part of the Schengen area... (Technically not, but their borders are open, so they might as well be).

You're probably not wrong. But by the sounds of it the artist never intended for this one to be particularly challenging. They expected it to be solved relatively quickly. 
So yeah you're partly right, but I still don't think that makes it a bad puzzle.

Dated a dutch girl. Always wondered about that... That actually makes a ton of sense...

I mean... It's a puzzle. 
No need to be salty just because you couldn't figure out the starting point and when/how the direction changed. 
As for the corner pieces going the direct opposite spiral, puzzle makers often try to misdirect/mislead. 
Nothing particularly wrong with arbitrary veils and twists and turns either. It's annoying and removes some of the logical aspect of solving it, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad puzzle. Or do you also hate maze games?

I wouldn't want my quality of life to be drastically worse just because I earn less.

I never said anything was true, just that people look back and go "Wow america was so much better back then! Everything worked (including social services) and now it don't!"

What was that one dumb movie about the wall with Matt Damon? I mean it flopped, sure, but it's only a sign of things to come. 
Edit: It was literally called the great wall lol. But my point is, they're starting to focus a lot more internationally. Dubbing might look terrible, but it's not exclusively Mandarin into English that looks bad. Foreign markets are already huge for hollywood, why do you think they keep making transformers? And why do you think a lot of the films suddenly take place in China?

Yeah, insane amounts of empty carbs and processed sugars, for dirt cheap. 
In lots of places you can buy a two liter of coke for less than the cost of a bottle of water. 
And when a cheese burger is just a dollar or two, do you really think people are going to pay 4x as much to go to a different place and eat a healthier sandwich that takes ages to make? 
It's just the culture here partly too. Nutritionally dead food with tons of salt sugar and carbs are dirt cheap here. Usually cheaper than any healthy alternative you can buy. And of course, wages tend to be pretty shitty here (and if they aren't, you're likely working a fairly sedentary job), so people will buy whatever is cheapest and fills them the most. Plus people work long days and have next to no time off, so the last thing they wanna do is spend ages preparing a good meal.

China is really ramping up its movie production. I wouldn't be surprised if they start competing with Hollywood in the next few decades.

Hows Liechtenstein or Monaco?
