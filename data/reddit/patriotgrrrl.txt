I agree that it's mildly annoying that people use the Mt.Gox prices as a  default price when it isn't actually widely used.

So does my bank.
@_date: 2014-04-16 09:57:42
So bitcoin really IS just used by criminals. Got it.
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:09:13
I'm so sorry for you.

Using normal units isn't elitist enough, of course.

Do you even know any humans in real life, you elitist prick??

The government can and does take people's money for any reason they want.

Wow. I heard credit card companies were tough, but I didn't know they were repossessing *children* now.

In addition to being false, that makes no sense.  .22LR cycles fine in a semiautomatic pistol, why would it not work in full auto?

More and more places are accepting it every day. There are coffeehouses, pizza places, and bars, some Subway sandwich shops, online electronics, t-shirt and gadget stores, some software sites,  gyft.com sells gift cards for many major retailers, and many more. There's even one car dealer in Texas.

Creating a new country would be difficult, but certainly easier if you didn't have to create a new currency at the same time. But having such a volatile exchange rate could cause problems.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:39:18
Just keep copies of the private keys, so a few months from now when you ask them "so are you doing anything with that bitcoin I gave you" and they say "Huh? Oh that paper with the funny squares on it? I threw that crap away", you'll still have the money.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:18:12
That's false, you can buy both plastic and paper wallets with bitcoin in them from several sources.
This may soon be made illegal in the US,  but the US is not the whole world.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:40:08
Sure, if they left the private keys where someone can find them.  I imagine a paper wallet, or the password to a local or online wallet, in a safe deposit box would be good for this, since there must be a procedure for someone's estate to access it. Or if its a small amount, just keep it where you keep stuff like the title to your car, your estate will be looking for that.
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:43:20
But then the price in dollars would have to change constantly.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:30:16
TBH, bitcoin is not for everyone. Some people I've seen asking about bitcoin recently seem to have difficulty with basic computer concepts like backing up files or choosing good passwords, so... yeah.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:32:59
Not hard-to-access places, but I have made qr codes with jokes in them and put them in random places.  No idea if anyone has scanned them, but if I do this again, I'll include a bitcoin address just in case someone wants to tip me.
I dunno if you can put both an address and some extra text in one, but OTOH, two codes next to each other would probably cause more curiosity.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:27:53
DO NOT use Mt. Gox.  They are no longer considered reliable.
Coinbase is considered one of the best exchanges in the US. Dunno about in your dad's country... he might have to sell them locally.

"several hundred"?   "a couple dozen"?
Do you realize how many WU locations there are?
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:58:49
It lets you enter your own codes (which you generated with an offline copy of bitaddress.org, for example), so you know they were originally good.  And you can [download the wallet generator from github]( so you don't have to trust that the site didn't keep copies of them once you entered them.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:07:30
Take the connector off the drive (or just damage it). Easy enough to replace if you have to, but no one's going to do anything with it accidentally.
@_date: 2013-12-25 03:52:05
That's one reason to use a payment processor like Bitpay, since (I think) they assume the risk.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:16:09
When I said "you can buy them" all I meant was "they do exist, and some people buy them".

Street view doesn't even go down that street.
MY Google shows that 189 Hill Haven Road is a house. Many small  businesses are run from the owner's house.
Also, they're listed as an FFL on CheaperThanDirt.

Funny!  I'm prepared, I have plenty of cider.

Not even corrupt employees, just human ones.   Coinbase has been known to have apparently random, unexplained glitches.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:23:04
Making a transaction without a sufficient fee is a gamble - it could go right through, or it could take days to get confirmed.   I'm waiting on one that's 48 hours old at the moment.

Stupid people will be stupid one way or another, that's no reason to regulate non-stupid people.

Won't help, they won't read it.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:32:09
How do you cancel it using blockchain.info? I have an unconfirmed transaction that's been there for two days now. 
I get the concept of doing a double spend, but it won't let me do that from blockchain.info, I'd have to copy the address to another wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:35:46
Only if they just sold. Why would they do that?
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:30:09
LOL at the sheltered white boy.  
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:28:04
You don't need bitcoin. Why, is someone forcing you to buy them?
Do you feel like you need everything you see people talking about on the net?
They're useful for some people, but few people *need* them.

The government is a very large organization and sometimes one part of it disagrees with another. This is not how it *should* be, but it does happen.

Wow, what a clever and convincing argument you made!

Would there be any interest in these made of fiberglass (circuit board material)?  I could have them made, probably in green with a gold plated pattern.

The same agents that let people get money into and out of M-Pesa and such will probably also support bitcoin.

A developer here on reddit recently offered refunds in bitcoin to people who purchased his app.  People (including myself) got a free app, but he presumably got a lot of downloads and more publicity than he would just by making his app free.
Even if it wasn't a 100% refund, this would appeal to many who are curious about bitcoin but not ready to commit a significant amount of money to buying some.

Use a program that is obviously broken to handle your money. What could possibly go wrong?

I agree.  
Mils (one L) are also used in America to mean thousandths of an inch. So for those of us who work with small things, it already seems natural.

I'd love to see an online wallet run by a company that's known for things other than bitcoins and that existed before bitcoins.  I'm sure banks have their reasons to not get involved, but maybe a major retailer?
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:08:51
