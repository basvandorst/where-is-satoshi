your approach to this problem seems the best to me.
predictions are just sorcery, they can make mathematical abstractions like if x people use bitcoin the price will raise to y.
but one can never know.

No, this is just a joke. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
But I really have to figure this number out, as long as I still own money!

So if I have 16.4BTC, can I expect to spend $30 every day from today with a certainity of 90%?

This picture shows nothing. This is just a small data set from Google, which is far from being able to derive a representative result from it. 
But I interpret the message in this chart as very positive.

The real Bitcoin is the first cryptocoin project that was named Bitcoin.
There is no other example in software history where a fork took over the name of the main project, so aint this one.
The increase of the Blockchain block size is stupid.

yes it is. but I guess there is no choice anyway

Exactly this.
Inflation is necessary in our society because a few take the most.
You have to destroy the value of money over time at some point to keep a balance between those who can hoard and those who cant.

Does not work in the german interface.
I made it work with following Regex:
`=SUBSTITUTE(REGEXEXTRACT(IMPORTDATA(" "\d{3,9}.\d");".";",")`
If you want to use it in  the english interface, you can use this version:
 `=REGEXEXTRACT(IMPORTDATA(" "\d{3,12}.\d")` 
Fixed a bug .\_.

That is what he believes, this is cool. Bcash is worth more than 95% of altcoins but still inferior to btc.
But he has to stop scam people, that is not cool.

Google already blocks many thousand Websites and if bitcoin.org scams people it should be part of it

I think, best would be an american lawsuit. I guess with that you can very fast make google hide bitcoin.com in the search results, what actually should be the fastest way to force bitcoin.com to be honest about bitcoin and bitcoin cash and stop misleading people.
