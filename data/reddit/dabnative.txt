Be a contrarian.  I too have seen the answer "NO" everywhere.  It's easy (and justifiable) to compare BTC to USD today and ask:  Is mining profitable?  These questions only need to be asked by someone who plans to go into the business of mining which requires revenue now in order to maintain operations.  Hobby miners have the luxury of operating at a loss.  If BTC fulfills its promise then we can tell our grandchildren stories of being able to mine BTC with relatively inexpensive equipment that was readily available.  It may not be profitable today, but it MAY be like mining gold in your living room before the world falls in love with gold.  For those with a very long view who are hopeful in the promise of BTC and have the courage to follow through on their beliefs, then mining is something one should do even if it's not "profitable" in terms of USD today.  You don't need a warehouse full of miners to participate.  Remember that each BTC can be divided into 100,000,000 pieces.  "Grandpa, how many Satoshi could you could mine in a day back in 2016?  About 100,000 with my old miner.  Wow!  Imagine it!  100,000 Satoshi a DAY!"  When you're deep enough down the rabbit hole that you're scouring Reddit for the answer to whether mining BTC is still profitable in 2016 it means you might be so close you have lost sight of the big picture.  On a final note, sure, you could buy some BTC but what fun is that compared to setting up a cool piece of equipment that you can tinker with and learn from and experiment with and develop your knowledge base.  Do both!
