Their trading volume is about 5-10% of Gemini and 3% of GDAX / Bitstamp, so liquidity may be a problem for large trades.
There's also a daily deposit limit of $2,000 for "Trade" class and $50,000 for "Trade Pro" class. If you only qualify for $2,000 and your bank charges $20 per wire transfer, it is fairly expensive.

I believe that most nodes will refuse to relay sub-1 TXs. But there's no rule that they can't be mined. If there's a need, maybe nodes can lower their min fee threshold. It does not require a fork.

Thanks but it is still prerelease software. I am not sure if it is stable enough.

Nodes that do not update will not see the witness data but will always accept segwit transactions as valid. They are essentially trusting the miners and all the updated nodes to do the validation for them.

Holy cow. Did you just consolidate a thousand outputs? That's like a 15KB transaction.

You can use the same BIP39 passphrase. It will be a different set of private keys because derivation path is different (m/49'/0'/0' instead of m/44'/0'/0')

Their entire engineering team is incompetent and can't be bothered to spend a couple hours to implement a good fee estimator, or withdrawal batching... I think we should just give up on them ever implementing segwit.

No, we don't. Just close the account and never come back. Coinbase does not deserve the respect and benefit of doubt.

Difficulty just adjusted at block 506017 (from 2.2T to 2.6T)
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:52:03
Back then it was still possible to get TX confirmed with no fees (there were some rules like TX size had to be under 1KB). I used to consolidate every 5 outputs, LOL.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:07:52
you maths are off... 500 to 488 is about 1.0245:1 so it is a 2.45% spread

@_date: 2017-12-13 15:31:39
This actually has $1 balance on it... too bad you can't move it.
Furthermore the funding TX only paid 5 sat/B and is not likely to get confirmed any time soon.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:31:34
More on this: batched transactions greatly reduces the number of "change" outputs, that coinbase will have to eventually consolidate or otherwise spend.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:24:49
Batching will significantly reduce space even with traditional (non-segwit TX). This is because when the exchange processes 50 withdrawals in one TX, there will be only one change output instead of 50. This means much less work to consolidate these outputs later.

Read up section 1256 please. The spot (real BTC on exchange) and futures are treated differently. The only way this can be treated as a pair (spread) trade is if the same exchange offers a bundled product for carry.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:44:19
On the contrary, we absolutely NEED people shorting! The more they short at 11,800 the better. When 12K finally breaks, shorts will desperately run for the exit and the squeeze will be epic.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:22:47
It sounds they are asking for trouble, by using just one exchange (Gemini) to provide reference price. Gemini has quite frequent (once per week) downtime, sometimes more than 8 hours due to "server maintenance". They should use a weighted average of several exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:26:56
Segwit transactions are cheaper because the TX signatures ("witnesses") are segregated from the TX. Each byte in the witness only counts as 1/4 byte towards the 1MB block size limit. (Technically the SegWit spec introduces a new concept of "weight unit" (WU) where a traditional TX byte counts as 4 WUs and a witness byte counts as 1 WU, and the new block size limit is 4 million WUs.)
There is no separate mempool for segwit transactions. They are prioritized simply because the way "weights" are calculated to favor segregated witnesses.

You need to consider tax implications. If BTC ends up higher in January, you'll be claiming short-term capital gains on your long spot (actual BTC) trade, but the capital loss on the short futures will likely get the Section 1256 treatment, which means only 40% of the loss can be used to offset short-term gains.

I'm not a tax adviser, but your assumption is likely not true. IRS does not treat crypto-to-crypto trades as "like-kind" exchanges. I'd suggest you study the tax code or talk to a tax adviser.

How many trades are we talking about here? Tens, Hundreds, Thousands? Or have you been day-trading non-stop?
A lot of this can be automated with a simple spreadsheet (or use the free Google docs). Get all your trades sorted by date, then figure out the cost basis and proceeds for each trade. Get the formula right then copy &amp; paste to all rows.

No, the scenario you described is not plausible. From a hash-per-joule perspective, ASICs are several orders of magnitude more energy-efficient than GPUs, and the gap is even larger between ASICs and CPUs. There will be fewer participants in the global mining competition, but they will all still be using ASICs. Difficulty will be adjusted downwards until it is profitable.

Addresses that start with 3 are P2SH (pay-to-script-hash). It is impossible to tell if they are segwit or not until they're spent, because only then is the script broadcast.

Transaction fees are super low right now! I just sent from a segwit address for $0.07 (0.00001 BTC) and got confirmed in 4 minutes.
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:00:18
I wouldn't believe you if I didn't just send a TX myself! I paid 1.6 sat/b and still got it confirmed within 3 blocks. I'm speechless.

Thanks. This appears to be a bug in the blockchain website then. Once the first transaction confirms, the middle transaction should be removed from the mempool because they conflict with each other. Instead it is now stuck there forever.

The AVERAGE transaction fee right now is $3. The MEDIAN is about $0.5.
Somehow I feel that COINBASE has something to do with the higher end of fees...

How is this more difficult? You may be unfamiliar with C++? This is very common syntax.
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:05:05
No of course they didn't implement anything! They're the ones paying hundreds of sats/byte right now. That's why the average TX fee is still almost $3 USD even though you can get a transaction confirmed with just $0.10
