Gasp! He was trying to befriend me the whole time just to turn on me and insult me like that. :P That evil bastard.

So, you would simply want control over what the bot sees and trying to make sure it is not seeing/doing anything that you don't really want to see or do. I can see why people would want that kind of thing in their homes because it would help them understand what is going on with their money and being able to see exactly what is going on.

I didn't know that. All I knew was that cats weren't dogs.

Isn't it a term in-  I forgot the term, there is a term in design that is about mimicking nature and showing that it has a lot more efficient than machines do. I think someone quoted as saying "people who design do not have degrees in biology" and that is true somewhat. What is efficient to someone who designs? A grid. 
What is efficient to someone who knows biology? Probably a beehive or a cell. It is how the - I believe - bullet train was able to get its efficiency up and noise population down, great idea.
So, the future of AI is a little like the movie Transcendence that mentioned. "the AI goes online..it repairs its own code himself. it gets very smart quickly. it goes to trade markets and becomes rich very quickly. then it buys components and builts new energy (solar panels). it builts his own army. and so on. long story short: we will be the apes for them."

Well, I will have to take your word for that but thank you for your insight!
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:02:41
Yeah, you would really have to put a lot of trust into what you considered to be the best for your money.
Do you think you would give the bot money if those two questions were answered in the negative?
I was more just wondering what others thought. Bots are something I have been hoping to see work for a while now.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:12:27
That's sad!
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:31:45
Yeah, you would really have to understand how that purse was trying to look at themselves and see what they were trying to make the AI do in its own way because of how the system came from them and came from their line of thinking.
As you said, it could be an NSA bot (which would probably cost the taxpayers something that would be ludicrously expensive) or it could just be a money monster as it just shovels all the money it can into its own mouth. 
I do wonder if an AI would be able to take lessons we have learned from bitcoins and apply them to other cryptocurrencies around the market, that sounds like a pretty good thing to try and see if it would be do-able.

I mean, an AI troll is just what one of the first AIs was, wasn't it? [Tay AI]( was a major shitshow.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:03:55
I imagine that there is a greater amount of... feeling good if you have control over it, wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:27:31
I imagine if a computer is able to find patterns in the great pyramids and patterns in nature, it is going to crack whatever pattern is holding the secrets to the meaning of life.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:08:08
Perhaps. I imagine that that would be the ultimate pump-and-dump strategy. Have a botnet of bots buying a coin that no one really uses, then make them a few dollars so they think they are going somewhere, and then just flush them away. The ultimate mess-about.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:21:48
Like 2001? That sounds a lot like what happened in 2001 with the monolith being super intelligent and showing the monkeys super intelligence but no no, the monkeys couldn't even figure out what was super intelligence?
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:12:17
Kinda! Kinda knew that
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:34:03
Well, I would say that the thing is is that there are not a lot of companies that are willing to give their bots to the public because why wouldn't they just use it for themselves? If you really wanted a bot to be given out like that, you would probably need to work at one of the biggest banks in the world to be able to do that. I could never imagine a company giving one of those out.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:17:28
Wow. :P Someone is an asshole sometimes haha
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:05:02
I imagine no programmer worth his salt would reveal that kind of code mainly because it could easily break his business if he was trying to sell the code to anyone.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:30:53
Too much for them to simply use the bot to be able to try and make sure that their own pockets are lined? Or simply because that you wouldn't trust their strategy? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:00:27
I hope that we are saved in their old calculating brains as friends then... or at least we get a spot on their top 100 RAM processes, I don't really want to be not remembered. :P I will say that much is my biggest fear. If the AI is the fantastic machines and they are going to out-skill us in everything they do, I hope they do it well and give us a few years of peace before they just rocket off somewhere. haha
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:09:08
That is a good point. It is random speculation and, beyond that, it is as you said something that has never truly been seen before. May I ask, however, what do you imagine would occur if you let an AI free on an unregulated economy? Just a guess if you may.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:41:13
Yeah, that is anonymity though. If you hand a man a mask, they will simply be themselves. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:27:10
I am rather glad that they will at least learn from us because I imagine that having AI that hate you would be a very bad thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:03:36
Can you elaborate on your points, if I may ask?
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:41:01
That is a little eviler, don't you think? The fact it is using the very thing it is trying to dismantle. Sounds like a Terminator in all honesty from me.
I mean, I wish it would use us as sources of knowledge but if a bot was to use sentimental analysis strategies as a sophisticated natural language processing and responsive human interaction, it could easily use us as a resource to exploit or bastions of knowledge. It really depends on what stage of life the bot was in.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:05:15
Thanks. I was just wondering if you thought it would affect Bitcoin or in what kind of ways but I like your answer, thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:55:41
Actually, that is probably a great idea. I wonder if it will soon be a reality.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:08:00
Thanks for your answer. I'll be sure to try and see if what you said makes sense. DO you think that the forward thinking of a human would be able to combat the problems that bots face currently or do you imagine that systems like that will always have flaws?
