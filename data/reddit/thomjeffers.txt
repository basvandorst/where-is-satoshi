You basically restated what I said but implied you were contradicting it.
It isn't anyone's fault but your own if you don't read a contract you sign and later try to weasel out of it. No sympathy from me.

Snowden? Probably.
Assange? Maybe.
Manning? It's possible.
Ulbrecht? Just no.

They are actually saying that you shouldn't be able to violate the contract you entered with banks and credit card companies, agreeing to arbitration first. 
After arbitration, if you feel the process wasn't fair, you are 100% allowed to sue the banks/CCs. But if you sue prior to arbitration no judge will hear it, as it should be according to contract law.
A good example of this is Ezekiel Elliot's case against the NFL:
He went through arbitration that upheld his suspension. Prior to the arbitration ruling, he sued the NFL in court. The judge threw out the suit because it was filed prior to exhausting all of the agreed upon means of arbitration. He recently refiled the suit AFTER the arbitration ruling was given, and this new suit will in fact be heard. The new suit focuses on the fairness of the arbitration process - did the NFL actually follow the guidelines that they agreed to in the CBA.

That does tend to be true, but that usually isn't what made them rich. When Elon Musk first decided to be an entrepreneur and said he figured he could live off of $30/month eating Ramen-type food every meal. He didn't get rich by saving the extra money, he got rich by leveraging everything he had into his ideas. Paypal payout of $150M - all went back into SolarCity/Tesla/SpaceX. His net worth keeps compounding - but it has nothing to do with the $7/day he saved eating Ramen.
Very, very few people really get rich from the salary of their job, leaving investments and frugality aside.
The 'ultrawealthy' often get to that point by taking on 5-10x their net worth in debt for some venture or investment with the goal of multiplying the investment many times over. 
i.e. You have $200,000 in liquid assets that you use to make a down payment on a $800k-$1M loan. You then use the loaned money to buy assets which can produce long-term cash flow in excess of the interest payments. So then after 10-15 years, you have millions of dollars in assets plus the consistent cash flow. All built from that initial $200,000 that you successfully leveraged. 
It is risky and that's why most people don't ever even think about trying something despite the life-changing potential.

You're thinking of John Kerry.
