Why are colored coins on the list?
They have been existing for quite a while. Do you happen to mean a specific colored coin implementation? 
Also I think 2016 is a very optimistic estimate for Rootstock.

Factom uses bitcoin

I agree that there seems to be a bigger demand than supply on localbitcoin.
But what I tried to convey with my post is, that it doesn't make sense to compare the localbitcoin volume with the daily mined coins and call it consuming bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:11:04
Localbitcoin customers selling more bitcoins per week than is mined. USA alone sold (equivalent) 60% of all the bitcoins mined in the last week.

What is a great way to make a private key without being on the internet?
And how do I get the public key from the private key?
Is there a beginners guide for such things?

Can you explain me why I should use felix trader?
@_date: 2016-03-01 10:12:29
Pretty sure the devs aren't. Maybe some fanboys.
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:18:43
Not hundred percent sure if this is right:
What about some sort of automated service/business/smart contract that forgot to upgrade and therefore doesn't accept the 'new bitcoins' and therefore won't act accordingly.
The participant won't lose his current bitcoins, but would lose money by losing out on opportunities.

Unlikely since Ethereum is trying a very different approach to Bitcoin and doesn't sees itself as a direct competitor.

0 confirmation spending is possible and should be secure enough for low value spending.
Double spending is still not possible because once the network detects the transaction (in seconds, like you see "pending transactions" on block explorers), it strongly prefers the first one.

In what way is this interesting?
Something like this happens in the stock markets somewhere every week. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:20:52
In this case the LTC was leading BTC.
But in general bitcoin and the whole crypto market correlates. The smaller coins react extremer though.

What ATM brand is this one?

Technically a 1€ "dump" could move the price by 5% aswell.
If nobody wants to pay more it is the new price.

No shit. This picture was posted yesterday and OP said so himself..
@_date: 2015-11-02 09:20:39




And it costs an extra 5.5% in the opposite direction.

I don't agree with the rest as I didn't have good experiences with them.
I wrote them a ticket and never got a reply back.
The problem fixed itself, but left a sour taste in my mouth.
The wallet app seems kinda unstable to me and doesn't always work as expected.
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:42:27
Honestly, this looks like rubbish.

Their upcoming ETF
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:18:34
$500 by the end of this week.
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:40:48
about 350
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:37:07
I think so.
The big miners have virtually zero energy costs aswell and get the new mining chips faster and cheaper.
With the fast rising difficulty your miner will mine zero coins before you make your money back
@_date: 2015-11-20 16:51:41
It is impossible to make ROI with mining with only 1500
@_date: 2015-11-17 11:34:00
So what?
@_date: 2015-11-27 12:34:50
There is just a reminder for the email. Where are the deals?
@_date: 2015-10-23 08:07:55
Abra charges 0.25%
@_date: 2015-11-09 21:12:01
Thanks for the quick reply.
Maybe the support didnt get through. I will write one again.

You are about 2.5 years to late for this.
