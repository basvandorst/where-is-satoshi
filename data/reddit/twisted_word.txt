@_date: 2016-08-13 02:01:47
And that entire assessment is just wrong. That is 99% of the time people just realizing they have no clue how something works when they thought did, and responding poorly.
There are still millions of people too stupid to program a VCR clock. The majority of Bitcoin's adoption problem is the stupidity of people, the learning curve is too high, and adoption itself pre-requires actually taking computer security seriously. No regular person takes computer security seriously, regular people brag and take pride in specifically **ignoring** computer security.
The vast majority of bitcoin's non-scaling related problems in adoption, are most definitely the stupidity of people.

Yes, and their limits go up faster. I went from 100$ fiat I think to 7 BTC limit in a month or two. I've also heard from many people they will raise limits if you just contact them and ask. And the most important thing, **you can withdraw to your own wallet instantly after purchase.**

These people have consistently, and in a frequently contradictory manner, simply preach "Satoshi said!" to justify whatever they want, and conveniently ignore anything Satoshi has said that contradicts anything they want. They are essentially using his name as a celebrity endorsement of sorts. 
"Big blocks cause Satoshi said so!" (While Satoshi did say this, he did not know about payment channels, or many other things that have happened since he has said this.)
"We want multiple clients to compete more in line with Satoshi's vision!" (Satoshi has himself clearly stated that running multiple clients on the network is a **bad idea** and a big risk to consensus. They ignore it though because it goes against their actions)
"RBF is just an excuse to not raise the blocksize, Satoshi never wanted this, it'll raise fees through the roof!" (RBF is actually **Satoshi's own idea**. Again, ignoring what he actually said when it contradict's their position.)
I could go on for a while if I sit here and dig around the internet, but I believe this proves my point. They have decided to advocate for an extremely reckless course of action in "upgrading"(I put that in the same manner Dr. Evil does) the network, and scream Satoshi's name and quote his writings whereever it supports their actions, but ignore anything he says that directly contradicts what they want to do.
It it an unbelievably disingenuous way of simply stealing Satoshi, and by selectively quoting him only where he seems to agree with them, making their arguments based on an appeal to authority. It is extremely pathetic, disingenuous, and in my mind a clear indicator of someone incapable of actual honest intellectual thought and analysis.

I think you are being waaaay overly-generous in giving the benefit of the doubt. English has rules, they do no change because you feel like "These words meant something else."

Vision: a mental image of what the future will or could be like.
of: indicating an association between two entities, typically one of belonging.
Satoshi: the man Satoshi.
It is black and white clear what those words mean: The vision of the future of Bitcoin as seen by Satoshi. That is **beyond** disingenuous, and is socially manipulative to a point I can't even believe.

 There is a collection of everything Satoshi wrote on the forums. **read that.** 
The quotes people link to on sites like BU's are complete horseshit. Satoshi had opinions earlier on, most of them changed. Throughout his discussions with people, his opinions and ideas were **constantly** changing. These people seem to only cherry pick quotes from early on that support their opinions, and conveniently ignore many things he said later on. Not to mention **many things were not discovered until after Satoshi left**. Absolutely any citation of any opinion of his as justification for anything is complete bullshit, because **no one** has any idea how his opinions have/would have evolved because of things that were unknown to him at the time he was still publicly communicating. 
Greg is 100% right about the manipulative nature of constantly appealing to Satoshi as justification for things. **He is gone**. We have no idea what his opinions are now, and they are irrelevant, he is **gone**. He built something to survive after he was gone, *without him*, not something dependent on following every word he has said before as if it were some holy roadmap from on high. 
LMFAO. 1) Proclaiming whatever you want and going "Satoshi said it!": totally okay.
2) Actually linking to Satoshi's words: Downvote it! Quick downvote it before someone see's it!

Honestly, my two cents opinion as someone who has never personally had a problem with Coinbase: it seems like their IT department has some very incompetent people in it. And glitches like this just get written off as FUDing. 
One of their wallet developers literally quit her job at a venture cap firm, learned Javascript in 3 months, and started working on their wallet. And while their is nothing wrong with learning programmnig, making a career change, etc. The idea that someone with 3 months Javascript experience is working on Coinbase's wallet...thats just batshit insane. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 08:06:14
No one is saying that the price should go higher and thats why small blocks. Small blocks are because there are technical limitation of what the network can do and maintain its performance.
Jeff said that fees should be up to the free market, well guess what, thats what is happening. Leaving the protocol as is is not central economic planning. Advocating RAISING the blocksize to ARTIFICIALLY keep prices low by changing the conditions the market operates under is central economic planning. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 15:03:39
My point is though...you don't need to move hundreds of millions of dollars of cash into bitcoin. You just need to get enough bitcoin that if the network succeeds in the longterm, the small portion you put into bitcoin will later be worth the total sum of the pie you want to conceal.

Right now only like 5% of the nodes on the network can facilitate block transmission with an orphan rate of .05%. and RIGHT NOW miners are almost totally dependent on a centralized relay network of nodes to mitigate orphan rates affecting there profit. Every bit we raise the blocksize limit without optimizing the peer-to-peer network and how it relays data worsens that situation and makes miners more and more reliant on a sub-network of nodes that is centralized in order to maintain their acceptable level of profitability. Point blank everything Gavin says in relation to the blocksize limit is dead wrong and directly contradicts the data on the network. 
Of course we eventually have to raise the limit, but there is work that needs to be done FIRST to lower the costs on nodes and improve their interconnectivity. Ideally miners should be propagating blocks through the entire network, not a centralized subnetwork. That is an attack vector that miners should not be reliant on in order to be profitable.

Or in the case of software games that constantly are rotating out of the actively played slot of gamers in the process I just described up caused by an idiot userbase(although idiotic in a different way in this case, bitcoiners are just ignorant of the complexity of the network they use, the gamers I speak of just suck). 
Most bitcoiners just do not understand the network, and have been swayed by uninformed echo chambers or opinionated developers in the minority who have been very outspoken. Core's roadmap is essentially this 1) Streamline Core's design, data structures, and isolate the consensus code into a library so other clients can just be built to do whatever else and reference that(modularize bitcoin to make development and alternative clients/forks/top layer functions easier). That NEEDS to be done. 2) Working into BIPs and slight tweaks in the protocol, THAT DO NOT AFFECT THE USE OF BITCOIN ON THE MAIN BLOCKCHAIN(capitals not for you StarMaged), to allow sidechains to build out other usable networks for btc pegged tokens, which helps scale alternative uses of bitcoins chain and allow research to fold back into bitcoin later, and allow Lightning Network(or other) payment network networks to work seemlessly. This allows users to make cheap transactions without settling on the main blockchain, but still interacting directly with it through using the same tokens/addresses/script system, so that it can both scale in an oh-shit full blocks and stampede of users case, and also deal with decentralizing offchain payments period for other uses such as micropayments. All of this needs to be done. and finally,, 3) in the meanwhile figure out a way to deal with the blocksize change, whether its a set schedule, no size, flex-cap, whatever. More research needs to be done. And things like sidechains will make that much more easily doable. What if all supporters of really big blocks could dump a few bits onto a sidechain, set up their own nodes, and see if they could handle it? Thats looking for an answer to a question, which needs to happen, instead of spouting an opinion.
If you ask me, they have a pretty solid game plan happening, and they need to ignore the undereducated and get to coding.

@_date: 2015-12-12 06:00:45
Honestly, jumping in not trying to start shit, but this is piss poor procedure. Every other service I have registered with that directly links to a bank account generates 3 random desposits of less than 2-3 dollars, and withdraws them. They then ask for the exact amounts transferred in and out, as only the account holder would be able to access records to see this. It is a much more secure(on the part of the account holder) way to verify the existence of and control over a bank account. You should look into doing something like this, anywhere Coinbase is active this is a legal way of verifying an account.

I both hold longterm, and spend. Thats just reality, and as much as I agree with you, you have to face it. Bitcoin has no place with any physical merchant, it is much more suited for internet commerce at this time. I spend bitcoin on stuff, I like using it, I like knowing I am not putting myself at risk of identity fraud. But I unlike alot of people don't make the kind of money where if I spend bitcoin I can just instantly replace it, thats part of a small pool of money/assets I have. When I purchase with bitcoin, everytime, I think "How much future gains am I giving up in spending this?" And those gains could short/long term put me in a better financial situation.
Part of the entire thing about bitcoin is personal responsibility for finances, and frankly where we at on the adoption curve if things go well, it is kind of foolish to spend alot of bitcoin unless you can buy it right back. Sometimes its smarter to save instead of spend.

@_date: 2015-06-20 18:27:03
its doesnt force them off chain, it just delays the confirmation by essentially building in a timed escrow that gets put on the chain for confirmation later to allow the network to scale. it allows the blockchain to confirm it later but solves the problem of dumping too much onto the network by demanding bigger blocks and the possibility of using a higher fee to double spend.

How about being able to buy a number of paper wallets with the private key exposed, and a change address programmed as the next in your seqeuence of paper wallets. When you want to make a purchase, sweep the key at the register and get change back to an empty one. This would allow merchant adoption while allowing customers to keep something similar to the cash experience. As well, should any type of error okay in the transactions being confirmed, the merchant still has the private key to spend from to resend the transaction, and still has your change address to get your change to you.

It would just be a regular old sidechain, likely following the same procedures as the main chain, except with a MUCH longer block time to accomodate the lag of lightspeed in transactions and proof of work transmission. It would likely have a second sidechain connected to the intermediary one on the planet in question. This way the main chain would function on Earth, there would be a chain on the other planet capable of quick confirmations for their local use, and the much slower confirmation chain linking the two to allow interoperability of economic exchange between the two planets. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:06:00
....yes it would. You're talking about something that involve a complete reset of all wallet addresses and all balances and figuring out a way to securely recreate the balances of the previous chain while ensuring the private keys are only given out to the correct owners of previous wallets. That would be even more than a hard fork.

if SHA256 got broken no private key would be secure and wallets would start emptying. every wallet would need to be regenerated in a way not linking the new private key to any old one in 256, or it would be compromised too. as well it would probably allow blocks to be gamed super fast because nonces could be picked based ob their output. that would totslly break bitcoin.

That really does absolutely nothing to solve the problem unless you put the majority of copies outside of miner pools and server farms on the thing like Storj. And running a full node would require storage, or bandwidth. The nodes without storage space will need to bandwidth to constantly be querying the chain copy on Storj. Unless you have most nodes on the network working like that, theres no point. And it still has the extra weakness of relying on another network, if just a part of Storj went offline in a way that parts of the blockchain were lost, poof. Security gone.

Maybe thats because users keep screaming for things that will centralize node counts even more, making bitcoin easier to attack politically, and will create the situation where it will de facto centralize even more the next time we get a huge rush of new users when they overload the nodes still online and we wind up with even LESS nodes running than a blocksize increase will cause when it fills up eventually. Not to mention the fact that it could make miners even more unprofitable and centralize them even more when blocks fill up and orphan rates increase for some parties, leading to them to shut down. 
They haven't "Appointed" themselves experts, they are the experts, and they are ignoring all the idiots screaming "This weapons too powerful, nerf it!" or "PVP isn't balanced, change this, change this!" that inevitably ruin a game when they bitch and moan that things aren't exactly like they want it, and leave anyway when it gets changed to suit their wants.

I have no clue where to even start testing that, but it makes a kind of sense to me. If 14% of bitcoins value is tied up in altcoins and primarily moving altcoin to altcoin it makes sense to me on a very basic level that essentially volatility and value removed from bitcoin would help price stability, but also push that stable point lower.

This is just wrong. The only way you would lose money investing in Bitcoin is if the value completely tanked. If you buy into Bitcoin, as long as the value is steadily increasing (a likely effect if it continues to gain popularity and more adopt it) you will have the equivalent of what you paid in with fiat in Bitcoin. Now again, short a complete crash, you will either maintain the same value of currency you had before in fiat, or realize gains as it increased in value. There is no way you will lose the overall value of fiat money translated into Bitcoin unless the entire system and its inherent value tanks. You will either make a gain, or break even. That's not even something you should need to have a complex understanding of economics to understand. You just need to be able to understand how to read and visualize a graph.

Why am I getting taxed on an insignificant gains in the big picture, while companies like Exxon, Shell, other Fortune 500 companies are being PAID BILLIONS in tax refunds and not actually paying a dime into the tax coffers to help run shit that taxes are supposedly designed to pay for. 
This is now branching more off into my personally philosophy, but fuck that. I think it is horseshit that I have to pay capital gains tax on a simple purchase, just to toss money in a pool to subsidize companies worth billions to they can add tax refunds to their in-house profit sheets, when they TURN A PROFIT.

Aside from that, we need to actually understand the manner in which the market is functioning and what factors are contributing to the value the market ends up setting. This is an experimental technology, attempting to bootstrap a new currency and economy. If that is to actually succeed, the factors influencing its direction need to be understand. If we want to actually create a new currency and economy, we need to understand how it interacts with and is affected by the current currencies and economies of the world, and have a better idea based on sound reasoning as to how we can encourage its growth. 
Yes, alot of people are watching money, yes a lot of people simply want to be reassured they will see a return on investment, but in my case at least I don't care about that. I simply want to understand what is actually contributing to its functioning(proper or not). Without understanding something and how it interacts with the world, how are we going to help it succeed as a nascent technology?

This could literally turn an entire country into a place pressuring major utilities, transnational companies, and local businesses in the country to accept Bitcoin as a payment method.

Bitcoin would be a good way to create a monetary presence in the world it could manipulate, it would not translate to more brain power for an AI.

Who gives two shits if alot of idiots in the US are obsessed with the latest iPhone, Bitcoin is something global, one country is irrelevant in the long term picture.

This isn't just it has merit so it wins, it can be smashed out of existence by governments, natural disasters, too little a group of people buying and using it.

We've recently just had these checks and balances allow businesses to do just that, courtesy of Citizens United. Centralization has allowed only the state approved ultra violent and barbaric people to have free reign to do these things. The state is why General Augusto Pinnochet was put into power on 9/11/73 in Chile, and allowed to turn soccer stadiums into places of mass executions. The state is why Al Qaeda even exists, because they were sponsored as a proxy group to fight the Russians. The state is why there are even threats like the potential for nuclear war, because without a cultural identity that expansive and competitive with other identities, who the fuck would have built nuclear bombs? 
The state is why businesses can monopolize resources and means of production, leaving us no option but to consume things from people who do things we don't support. Because otherwise people could say fuck you, go somewhere else, and then their business failing would force them to default and sell off the resources they produce from to someone else, who would be faced with the same threat of no customers if they do things we do not support. 
One day is now, because if we don't start testing how to implement things like that, if we don't work out the problems and see what aspects of society can be run like that and what can't, then it will never happen. The state will simply continue consolidating power, continue the monopolization of violence and production, and eventually we will be left in a world a million times worse than what you describe of old anarchy. Because once the state and government entrench themselves to that degree, there is no chance for organization and delegation to arise from that, it is simply that paradigm or the entire thing collapsing. 
And what gains? have happened in the past 20 years? Civil rights? Where is the economic well being of those affected by that to back it up? No where. Inclusion of gays and transgendered as protected statuses under those laws? How has that helped with the alienation of young homosexuals, the suicide rates of gays? Almost not at all. Slapping a rule in a book does nothing to change anything except the perception that a problem exists. All of these problems are not something that a government can legislate, they are changes people must make in themselves, for themselves.

And read some more history. Look at how regulation and centralization has simply been a tool widely abused by private interests to solidify and empower monopolies pulling off some of the worst shit in history. Russia's transition to capitalism and the oligarchs it created, Ma Bell being broken up and the companies that resulted entrenching in little monopolies for coverage area until they slowly started buying each other back up and re-conglomerating, China's transition to capitalism and the resulting upper class literally destroying their country. America's military industrial complex that has an almost exclusive financial "dibs" on any aerospace contracts from NASA and an almost total monopoly on private spaceflight. 
None of that would have happened without regulation and control of their market environment being concentrated in government, to be bought out by private interests at a premium. We would have responded one way "Fuck you."

Hey, it doesn't necessarily mean new people will be buying in, but it does show that having Bitcoin thrown into the public eye was enough to increase interest. I mean, the price is down, the but thing is still accepted in stores. People still buy it. It still exists.

Where did I say something about removing rule of law? You are putting words in my mouth and using a blatant straw man argument. I said nothing except pointing out that the funding of services and infrastructures could be organized way more efficiently than taxation by a single organized body that is over bloated, and generally not in a position to decide the most efficient way to spend that money for the greatest ROI of the collective pooling to create that infrastructure and provide those services.

Get involved. Hell, I'm in the middle of reworking my education major because Bitcoin resparked an interest in computer science. I might not be able to program at the moment, and might not have the best understanding of computer science, but that doesn't stop me from thinking over existing problems. When I have an idea I think has merit I question people with a better understanding of things than me. Things don't succeed just because people watch them, you have to learn and get involved to help improve them yourself. Think about how long it took for alot of technologies to catch on. The internet was something for nerds and computer experts for almost 20 years. Cars...they had to build all the infrastructure to transport fuel and allow them to driven first. Trains required railroads. You have to lay the groundwork first before something really becomes a useful part of everyday life.
There's alot more things to be depressing or uplifting in life than Bitcoin, concentrate on those or turn your attention on Bitcoin in a more positive contributing way.

Also, most likely this would simply be one country getting cut off from the rest of the world, as any other situation similar to this would more likely bet the entire internet coming down, which would make bitcoin pretty much worthless. So in essence it would most likely only be merchants in that country affected, and they could easily accept transactions as long as coins being spent were proven valid before the split. Really all you would have to worry about it double spends outside that network (which would mean there is a connection to the outside segment and make this a moot point) or new coins minted on the smaller chain, as once the smaller network segment connected to the larger one, those would become invalid.

But also any transactions from the shorter chain that were valid would be put back into the transaction pool to be confirmed in the longer chain, so in the end most valid transactions would be put into the longer chain after they were confirmed.

I can't find it online, which reinforces some observations of mine that print and digital medium stories from the same news organizations tend to take drastically different approaches to how they portray Bitcoin, but the Chicago Tribune published an article last week saying that Mt.

No, that is a vast over simplification of that argument. Services and infrastructure, those are communal things that are needed. But you know what, I would go out and help build those things myself if I was allowed to. But I'm not, because they must be maintained by people designated by an economic structure that will hemorrhage money through insane inefficiency at maintaining and constructing that infrastructure and providing those services. 
Taxation is theft, at the potential threat of force, instead of letting people be responsible for things themselves. Just allowing me to take that money myself and put it into a more logical fund of my own choice to actually spend that money where it should be spent would be more efficient, as opposed to me doing things myself (as I am not going to have the skill set to maintain everything). However, because those things are needed, "taxes" are apparently the only way to deal with those needs.
More than spoiled brats and extremists believe taxes are theft, and have valid arguments for them.

Everybody here realizes that this solves a very serious long term problem facing piles of money right? What the fuck happens if someone dies before they give their private keys to someone else. Inheritance, arbitration of estate assets, etc. This is all solved by something like this. 
How about not hardcoding a preset time to disperse a transaction in it, how about attach a time of inactivity to an account and if no transactions have been performed before that timer is elapsed, then process a transaction. For small scale wallets you could have a very regular transaction time set up, which could also function as a security method for lost devices with wallets on them. They disappear and the person who finds it can't access the device fast enough, the funds are sent to a safer wallet that the owner can then retrieve coins from. 
In the event of death or distributing funds in accordance with wills, larger savings wallets could have much longer times. I don't see why a year or decent fraction of one couldn't function, and in the event of a death waiting for the funds to be released, I don't see why some type of framework wouldn't be drawn up to credit out money against an account waiting for the automatic transaction to go through. 
This is a very useful feature. This is like HD wallets tackling the problem of blockchain forensics destroying privacy, its a huge jump forward.

Advice piece number one: DO NOT, DO NOT, invest more money than you could have set on fire and be okay financially. If you dump all your money into Bitcoin, you ARE taking a risk that you could lose half or more of that value overnight. I am a firm believer in Bitcoin, in what it could do to empower people to control their own money, and how it could fundamentally alter how our economy works.
However, it is still experimental. Bitcoin could be outlawed tommorrow, the market could be and has been artificially manipulated, and if secured improperly(this is what you should research most thoroughly if considering purchasing any) they can be stolen. 
Only invest what you can afford to lose or do without in the event of a huge price crash.

I think what he's saying is that the banning of exchanges dealing with fiat banks will create a situation where it is a lot harder to fluidly move from BTC to yuan. This will probably create a situation where its insanely easy to hand someone cash to buy Bitcoin, but not quite so easy to cash out big amounts in that manner. There fore its likely people who buy in at that point will simply begin spending it or holding it in Bitcoin, further pushing adoption by merchants and other services.

To everyone in here talking about how early they could have jumped in, I first heard about it not too long after it was released. In my drunken hazey mindset at the time I wrote it off as an insignificant pipedream that would fizzle out. I was wrong. I'm still putting money into it, I still believe in what it can do. Just because I wasn't one of the early adopters doesn't change that, in fact, it makes me a more ardent supporter. My snap judgement was wrong, and upon seeing that, I'm here for the long haul. Whether that is something that brings me personal gains, or the loss of whatever I invested, I don't care. This is either the real thing, or the proof of concept. Regardless of which it is, I'm putting my weight behind it.
On a side note, fucking kickass man. Its awesome that the timing of you investing and how that played out helped put you ahead of the curve financially in your life. Just another example of how Bitcoin is useful for more than internet heroin money :)

Are you kidding me? So someone like me bringing in less than a dollar a day, I need to pay fucking taxes on that? Not being able to pay taxes in Bitcoin that essentially is a heavier tax levied against my real income from my real job. That is fucking bullshit. On the scale I am mining that is like taxing me for picking up change on the ground. So that is essentially a loss I am taking buying equipment, and now a second loss because my regular job's paycheck is now subject to a heavier tax cut. I am likely never to see a profit on my mining investment unless Bitcoin price skyrockets, in which case that is a capital gains. Why the hell am I being taxed on that tiny insignificant return now as income? I am perfectly willing to pay capital gains tax on huge valuation increases in the future, but fuck you if you except me to fork over almost half of the .97 cents I make a day now, not to mention half of what comes in as the difficulty increases when that happens, and then again, and again.

As in it was something that had a legitimate use to society, look at how many ancient and current societies not adapting to western culture have partaking in a psychedelic drug as a sort of right of passage into adulthood. I have indulged a few times in my life, and I would like to think that it created a positive and eye opening change in my world view and attitude. That was the potential of the psychedelic revolution in the 60s, but instead of having that experience and getting on with their lives, too many people became stagnant and stuck in that experience instead of progressing as people.
I believe he is saying that there are too many people simply shouting "To the moon!!!" assuming that Bitcoin will experience widespread adoption just because it exists, and instead of actually addressing the current problems it is experiencing both technically and as far as public perception and ease of use, people are simply chanting "To the moon!!!" That attitude needs to change if Bitcoin is to actually succeed beyond a niche payment method. People need to actually turn around and see the world they are in with fresh eyes and consider how Bitcoin can fit into that, as opposed to thinking that just because it exists the world will conform to it.

...Why the hell would anyone back out of Bitcoin? Simply do not link your personal information to an exchange, if you do, document it. If you make a transaction, document that as well. If a wallet is generated half way around the world, or through a proxy server, but is not holding your assets. Deny it. Go to court. Don't just back out and give up. That kind of attitude is what will lead to a failure of Bitcoin. Do you not see the coordinated attack of credibility through mainstream media?

I don't mean to seem inconsiderate, but this is a perfect moment for Bitcoin to step in and make a very real and visible PR that is undeniably positive.

Even if it was something as small as functioning as a bridge gap until the strike is over so people aren't just punched in the gut. Not to mention an almost required side effect is that is an at least temporary adoption of it by businesses.

Ive used and seen many javascript paper wallet generators out there, why not simply start bundling/linking them to smart phone wallets. All you would really need is instructions (and maybe an aspect of the program to scramble RAM contents) to unplug your computer from the internet, print the wallet, and then restart and reconnect. Just take everything off the exchange and keep what you aren't comfortable leaving on your phone on paper wallets. 
It might be off putting and counter-intuitive to alot of people, but I don't see how that process is so complicated. Paper wallets should be pushed alot more for new adopters wanting to safely store things, you can keep pocket change on an app wallet, and all it takes is scanning a QR code to sweep it back into a hot wallet.

Yes, but without saying definitively saying there are shills, they would still need them.

You have to crash the market and destroy public opinion, or the market will eventually recover, because people will just buy up coins cheaply and hold them.

So you openly admit, outside the insurance coverage of FDIC, you do not trust a bank? That makes it sound more like you trust FDIC and not a bank itself. As well, are you saying you have so little trust in yourself that you could not protect your own assets in Bitcoin? Sounds like you have a low estimate of your own intelligence. Seeing as I don't know you, I won't argue your assessment of that. 
As well, the inherent fluctuations of Bitcoin's value are due to them being valued in fiat currencies. Now what if that value was to be tied to something like...energy production? Like a fiat currency is? Or food production. Or any number of things that have INHERENT value. 
Yes there are flaws in Bitcoin, like ANYTHING created by people. The thing is, Bitcoin's flaws can be fixed, new purposes can be found, and its usefulness can be increased. Explain to me how that applies to the current international banking system.

One, go to hell is your argument? Its not perfect is the only response statists have to HUGE flaws in our system that bleed out to the rest of the world and support even worse flaws and inequalities across the rest of the planet. Anarchy is not everyone for themselves, it is allowing organization to happen without someone who has no business regulating and controlling dictating from above how something should be organized. Bureaucrats should not be dictating economic policies, or telling an engineer how to do their job, or telling an environmental scientist what they can and can't do to maintain the environment when they have no clue how these disciplines work. 
In a world where those who know how to do something are the ones organizing efforts to do so, more things would get done. And I would be the first person to step up to make sure that someone else's child exists in a world like that safely, I believe alot of people who espouse these attitudes feel the same way. You can't hide the world from your child, but you can also count on others to help encourage a safe environment for them as they learn about it.

Don't write off the possibility of governments trying to sink Bitcoin, they have many many reasons to want to do so. The only barrier preventing them is public exposure, sentiment, and understanding.

No, Boko Haram is reported to smuggle weapons through Sudan. They are active there. Again I apologize if I am offending you or seem to be misinforming people, but dealing with bitcoin activities that could potentially be linked to terrorism is going to be the next attempt at publicly smearing Bitcoin in my country (America) and I do not think enough people really appreciate that. I definitely agree that helping the unbanked is a huge use case for Bitcoin, but until cash to Bitcoin options mature a little bit I believe that connections between first and third world countries can be used as ammo by governments to attack Bitcoin if not handled right.

People taking your stance are missing the point completely. This simply introduces a new paradigm pools can use, and GETS BITCOIN INTO CONSUMERS HANDS. Without getting people using Bitcoin, then this will go no where, and people mining are just scammers trying to cash out at the highest point before it crashes. You are looking at this from the perspective of a miner crunching ROI numbers, not someone who just goes "Huh, I can check Bitcoin out now without connecting my bank to some shady exchange or doing something I think is borderline illegal." If your ROI is going to be negative, then don't do it. But stop constantly talking shit about a product not even released when there are people who may want to buy it, and who are not judging the product under the same criteria you are. We'll all see what happens when shit hits the market, until then, we DON'T KNOW what will happen.

I have educated myself. And if you pay attention, fanatics are screaming louder, but the quiet majority is slowly wising up to the fact that they cannot keep pulling this shit. They have an option between instigating full global war fighting every grassroots effort out there, or start looking for ways to maintain influence that has more checks on it. People with power are not stupid, and it is more likely as time goes on that they will opt for the second option. Specifically in America. The US military will NOT win in an open conflict against the populace, because by the time it gets to that point we outnumber them, and people in positions of power are not going to be able to convince our military to do more than attack specific groups that can be painted as trouble. When the "bad guys" organizational lines move past groups that can be painted with a bad public image like that, that move is no longer possible. I am not fantasizing, I am taking a realistic look at the way this world is heading.

I see your point, and won't argue about anonymizing efforts. But heres my two cents: I don't think this will happen still. I think the more mainstream Bitcoin becomes, the more law enforcement will see the value in not blacklisting coins. The blockchain is a great tool to use to track criminal organizations, and blacklisting their money is a good way to make them work around that in a way thats not trackable. All it would take is a government like China saying "Fuck you America, we don't care," and exchanging whitelist coins for blacklist coins. Then when America needs to be paid by China for something, will they refuse to accept those blacklisted coins? As well, that atmosphere will really push conversations about what illicit activities(drugs and such) should and should not be illegal to the forefront. And quite frankly if sensible policies are enacted around drug use, I don't care if the blockchain is used to stomp out problems like that. Because at that point there isn't a single illicit trade I think deserves to NOT be stomped out. 
At the end of the day I don't think this will be a problem on the scale you see because both citizens, and the powers that be have something to gain from not doing that.

Versus the certainty that the "project" of the entire global economy will? Everything is dangerous through that lens. My point is that making a decision that could have a disastrous effect on the incentives to run a node is more dangerous than other alternatives. 
As much as I really hate it, I feel like letting centralized services like Circle and Coinbase bear some load is a better patch than screwing with the incentive balance of the network itself. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:28:38
But they owe income tax on the value at time of a block being solved. They could wind up owing taxes on say...1000 coins at 500$. Now if the value drops to 250$, they still owe income taxes on 1000 at 500$, and can only write off 3000$ per year in capital gains loss. In other words, big scale miners could get screwed hardcore.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:23:46
Well...to quote many comments below ( I didn't even know you could run a node without mining ), you're doing that out of charity. Stop running the node or start mining. Bitcoin has the potential for much more than a commodity or financial transaction network, and to limit new evolving functions is to limit Bitcoin's long term ability to survive.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:49:22
Is this due to the protocol itself or miners setting their own policies to make transaction fees worth the processing power?

Tesla can also produce MORE Tesla's, and increase the rate at which they are produced. Bitcoin cannot do that without a radically change in the basic protocol. The rate of production will remain constant, and the amount of production will follow a predictable declining curve. Imagine one line on a graph with a negative slope, and one with a positive slope. The negative slope represents the production of bitcoin over time, and the positive slope represents the increase in demand for Bitcoin. Once point of demand rises above the point of the slope representing production, it will result in an increase in value because at that point the rate of Bitcoins production will always be smaller than the demand for it. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 03:18:34
Are you serious? Thats not a stupid chant. That affects how quickly transactions can proliferate in the blockchain, which means more storage requirement, which puts more strain on nodes. We need to either dynamically increase block sizes, or not at all, and work on micropayment networks off the chain that still reference chain input. Storage space is not cheap enough without an economic incentive to just maintain a node.

21s plan is the DISTRIBUTION model, not the PROFITABLE MINER everyone will buy. If you want to talk negatively, talk about that. I've heard enough bitching about ROI. They're not trying to get everyone to buy a miner and profit mining, they're trying to get people in possession of bitcoin and used to using it for microtransactions. That way people will get used to it and more open to further bitcoin use-cases. Right now tax laws and KYC laws make it too complicated for everyone to use an exchange for that, and its a lot more complicated than buying a device and plugging it in. Most people in America have a shit load of electronics, and many are plugged in constantly in alot of households. Having an ASIC pop on in a phone when its charging, or a router or phone charger, is not going to make people instantly dismiss this idea.

Neither are cheap enough. Bandwidth more so, but storage too. I just spent 60 dollars on a TB harddrive. At 1 MB a block, assuming they're all full, thats 52,560 MBs a year for the blockchain. Thats .0052 TB. I can manage as a full node without eating up my whole harddrive. 
Now run that with 20 MB blocks. That is an entire terrabyte in a single year. I am not going to buy a new harddrive every year with no economic benefit just to maintain the blockchain. And thats not even touching on further increases in block limits, again assuming all blocks are full. Storage space is not cheap enough to maintain decentralized nodes with a higher block limit. Plain and simple. If you want to see another 90% drop off in nodes, go ahead and raise. I see that as a serious problem for the network.

Maybe I just want to run a small online business, or convenience store, and accept bitcoin. Maybe my business plan is just being a business that accepts bitcoin. Maybe my business doesn't make 1 million+ in profit that I can afford to dump into a node at the scale of EVERYTHING on the main blockchain dirtcheap. 
And again, way to COMPLETELY ignore the fact that you edited your comment after the fact to make my reply look out of context. That is a shady and underhanded way to engage in dialogue, no matter the forum. 
Your argument is essentially just "scale things in a way that exponentially increases the costs of running a node, but everything will be okay because everyone that uses bitcoin will spin up a new node!" Thats completely fallacious logic. 


First the same amount of transactions is BS. Secondly, the bandwidth and CPU increase is true for regular old block increases. 


No it does not make bitcoin a toy. Because with things like payment channels, and sidechains which allow you to get very inventive with alternate methods of securing a blockchain dealing with only coins voluntarilly put there, without affecting the main chain(and do not argue that miners need fees. Shrinking supply and the real world value of the block reward increasing is what will keep miners funded longterm) you can scale magnitudes of order higher without drastically increasing the cost of running a node on the main chain. Which means, in that scenario, new users actually WILL spin up new nodes unlike in your scenario. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:33:31
Then XT should be out of the question I hope, because BIP 101 is just that. (Not in terms of the actual transactions growing, but in terms of the blocksize limit *EDIT*: And that can also make it worse, because you could have say 15% grow for a while whle the blocksize limit climbs to say 20 MB, then have a huge spike to full blocks that goes way beyond an exponential increase in transactions). Not to mention the thing that everyone ignored when XT was first launched, and ignores now: NONE of the current clients can have blocks bigger than 32 MB, and that has nothing to do with the blocksize limit. All of these clients have upper limits of 32 MB of ANY datastructure they work with, and if you try to push one on them bigger than that they will crash. Thats completely recoding the client from the ground up to fix that. 
Core and Blockstream have every intention of increasing the limit, but there are lots of problems to fix first that alot of non-technical people don't know about, and will cause more problems if we try to scale up now without fixing them first.

Idea: add new new output in transactions with a blank receiving address to break off part of the fee to, the first node that gets it fills it in and spreads it around.

Yeah, I will ignore it. Because it is in NO WAY factual data having anything to do with the topic of this discussion. It is completely disconnected and disjointed similes that essentially go "Duuuuur, it COULD happen..." 
Well frankly fuck off if your only response to factual mathematical data is "Duuur, things COULD be different in the future." I'm not taking a chance on COULD. 
This is a discussion about scaling bitcoin, not the fact that Einstein was wrong about something, or people didn't believe human flight was possible. But I suppose you'll just make another response essentially saying "It COULD happen" in response to undeniable cold hard facts stating that it CANNOT happen RIGHT NOW. 
*EDIT* I suppose we should just keep centralizing bitcoin until physicists can create a wormhole to a pocket universe, right? We should just turn things into a censorable centralized system because in the future physicists COULD theoretically create an entire isolated universe to handle computations faster, right?

No, maybe your confusion comes from not understanding the words you are using. The miners and economic nodes ARE THE ONLY THINGS OF MERIT as far as network components besides users. Users who do not mine or run an economic node are irrelevant beyond their ability to sell/buy coins and affect the economic viability of the network as a whole.
They maintain their position on the network, and their value to the network, by providing the service of mining or being an economically relevant node. Hence they have merit in terms of providing resources to the network where you do not aside from whatever economic weight you can push around.

Go look up how long it takes a bitcoin signature to be verified by a CPU, then go look at how estimates of daily transactions of currency on Earth, and then do the freaking math for validation times for different block sizes. If you are expecting someone to do basic math like this and lay it out for you, fuck off. You are not entitled to anything on a silver platter. I just told you how to verify or disprove the claim that main chain scaling doesn't work, so go fucking do it.

They are alternative clients whose purpose is to create an altcoin. As far as I know both hardforks in bitcoin's past were unanimous and due to a security threats. Everyone came with. Both Classic and XT intend to fork before everyone adopts, essentially creating a branching fork intentionally. That is the definition of creating an altcoin(not all altcoins are totally from scratch, as you remember the first Namecoin was forked from bitcoins code, and other altcoins have forked from bitcoin). It is not a contiuation of bitcoin without everyone going along, argue semantically which one will wind up being called Bitcoin at the end all you want, but whatever client initiated the fork created an altcoin by all technical definitions.

You are spazzing out like a child. The fee is set at a default. The fees CHANGE based on the MARKET. You deal with that, by changing the fee. Thats not a fatal flaw in bitcoin, or an indication that its broken. Its an indication that you did not learn how to use the software you used and are blaming that on the software. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 05:32:20
And it is truly amazing to see all the work that needs to get done in your head before you can use a simple piece of software. Fee's change, and when the average goes up, you can go ahead and take full advantage of that user function that lets you change fees, and USE it.

Bitcoin won't scale on chain because of PHYSICS. Because of how fast electrons can move in a computation through a CPU. That has nothing to do with Bitcoin's current state, it is a fundamental physical fact of the natural universe.

What the heck do you mean if one side of the channel is offline too much? That doesn't just close a channel. It just means that maybe one route is not an option because someone's client can't be negotiated with for a route. And if you are not trying to make or receive a payment that doesn't affect you at all. The blocksize raise comes AFTER optimizing all the effects transfering more data has on the network. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 02:06:15
None of the fees for using Lightning Network would go to Blockstream, they would be paid to the people who have payment channels open and money in them providing liquidity to use. Nothing Blockstream has developed will in anyway make them money through fees for processing bitcoin payments. Their revenue stream is likely planned as consulting on tech/software rollouts until enough people figure them out to the point where no one needs Blockstream's consultation. And there's nothing wrong with that, everything they're doing is opensource, modifiable, and anyone out there can make and deploy a sidechain after the first one is functional, or help decentralize lightning by providing liquidity in channels(earning a fee for providing your coins as liquidity, pretty reasonable in my opinion and also creates a way where small holders incapable of mining profitably can still use bitcoin as a way to generate income). 
Blockstream is not some evil company, they're software engineers. They're trying to streamline and make the code as efficient as possible before scaling, because then it can scale bigger than it would be able to without the streamlining and added efficiency it brings.

I'm not a core dev, and I feel the exact same way. Lightning is useful for many other reasons, but chiefly as an "Oh shit, we've raised the blocksize to the point node operators and miners can handle right now, but more people keep coming" magic bullet for a temporary fix. 
It also allows webs of micropayment channels without spamming the hell out of the blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 06:56:50
I've been popping around the sub for an hour or so, and have not seen discussion this interesting here in months. Devs should really start bringing more of these types of discussion in the open, maybe look for volunteers to look over the discussions, grasp it, and dumb it down a little while still maintaining clarity of the original ideas. Dev's have actually knocked a few things out of my noggin I'd read a bout before and forgotten after not reading more. That kind of scares me as a long term holder stepping back for a second. The technical side of things really should get broken down a little more by others to distribute to non technical holders/interested parties.

A U2 draws about about 1/60th to 1/40th the power of a lightbulb. Are you seriously trying to tell me that everyday people will flip out about the electricity cost of a lightbulb? The idea here is distribute mining(likely to educate people about mining and why decentralizing is important), and distribute enough bitcoin to use in microtranscations to get people used to using bitcoin.

Stop right there. No I did not say that. I said they make NO SENSE on the main blockchain. No where did I say they won't work. They're just expensive, in efficient, insecure, and cause a number of other technical problems. These facts are inescapable. These are why they DO NOT work fine. They are doable, but horribly inefficient and with a number of consequences that make spending micropayments afterwards a gigantic pain in the ass and marginally extremely expensive. 
I'm not going to explain why they work fine today but won't in the future, because they DO NOT WORK FINE today. If you refuse to look at the number of explanations I gave you or cannot understand them, you are not technically qualified to even be taking part in a debate like this.

When did I say they are not there? They don't make economic sense. Most of those transactions are people playing with bitcoins, or moving tips around, or just testing it. Or stress tests/network attacks/etc. No one is making transactions like that for actual economic exchange. 
Anecdotal evidence of how the ecosystem will work when less than 1% of the world population uses bitcoin is a total fallacy. And again I've explained how the nature of digital metered goods versus physical goods is completely different, and easier to game for the spenders benefit. Yet you once again go back to using PHYSICAL MERCHANTS as the center point of your argument against me. You are comparing apples and oranges. 
I wrote two paragraphs on the FACTUAL ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL REASONS that micropayments do not make sense, and you complete ignore all of that, and point out "they're on the chain now" so they must make sense. Alot of bitcoin transactions make no sense, do you have any idea how many times I've made transactions just to tinker with new wallets or functions, or just move stuff? Not to mention the anecdotal statement at the end about PHYSICAL MERCHANTS when we are discussing DIGITAL GOODS/SERVICES.

I think that is a perfect amount for a company like Blockstream, they are pretty efficient with money from what I see, and are trying to work on the actual underlying infrastructure to scale it, keep it secure, and build in functions and pieces to be able to integrate securely with other networks. You have to remember that Blockstream was invested in by the same people investing in Coinbase, Bitpay, etc. Blockstream is the hedge to their other bets, making sure the technology stagnating or failing doesn't bring the whole house of cards down. And quite frankly with the Bitcoin Foundation, and places like MIT funding research with a dripping faucet, it was a necessary move. 
Everyone involved wants a successful bitcoin, but there is so much hostility here because you have such diversity. You have people sleep-walking level fluent with technology, but totally ignorant of social aspects or economic aspects. You have hardcore economists completely ignorant of technology (aka, barely understanding their computer, so practically retarded when it comes to computer science, networking, cryptography, etc.). You have enthusiasts who were sold simply by "Secure, decentralized, and deflationary" and have no idea about any of the knowledge fields unevenly distributed that are necessary to really look at bitcoin, and see what it can be, and what will probably not work. People who claim developers like Greg Maxwell are economically illiterate should watch his speech on transaction privacy. He gets the economics, the technology, and the trade offs involved. All of the people at Blockstream do. And frankly, I think its probably the thing that will keep this ship from sinking having those people at a single place, with a nest egg of assets to draw from conservatively in the long term, and actually get the work that needs doing done. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:30:06
Those are costs now. Looking at the cost of nodes in 20 years along the BIP 101 proposals like XT, your costs will not be that low. Technology is getting better, but not by much. And quite frankly the type of advances that will allow you to host a node with 1-8 GB blocks around the costs of your current nodes will involve entirely new physical mediums. The cost curves of those entering the market will be different, and are by no means guaranteed along the time table of current physical mediums advancing, which will hit a brick wall eventually. 
All I, and I believe Core, is advocating it to streamline the main chains datastructures, build in functionalities that have been discussed for YEARS, and build on top of it other layers for functionalities not compatible with the main chain. THEN raise the blocksize limit. No one is sitting here saying they won't raise the blocksize until LN or sidechains handle most transactions, or hit a certain metric of liquidity. They are just saying lets get the software deployed first. And despite all the screaming about LN being vaporware, I've seen a few different implementations with code on github.

Robotic labor will likely just be the hedge against industry collapsing during a period of heavy social disorder during political/climate/religious/societal upheaval. We started off the last century with only about 1.75 billion people. This one started with 6, is already at 7, and theres no new real estate while resources are started to dwindle.

No, fees will adjust. You can either pay the same fee and wait longer, or pay a higher fee for the same quick confirmation. Currently the blocksize is 1 MB, it is finite, therefore the fees that miners use to include transactions are the thing that will fluxuate based on demand for blockspace. 
The blocksize will be raised, after optimizations are made. Things to make relaying blocks less bandwidth intensive, ways to improve the security of SPV nodes, and changes to allow top layer solutions built on. Then the blocksize will be raised, in the safest way possible. There's alot of proposals, not alot of data on them yet. There's time. Bitcoin will come out at the end better suited to fit all sides needs. Be pratical, the infrastructure for spending is almost laughable compared to just purchasing and owning bitcoin or trading it. Most of the next big wave of adopters will likely just be people trying to get their savings someplace safe, not spending it all the time for everything they need. Those of us currently using things, I think 15 cent fees are something crippling to deal with in the case of a bunch of new users like that. 
If you optimize first, you can scale bigger.

Guess what, by the same logic you just used, Bitcoin ever scaling is just a dream, cause it would take at least 6 months to happen. You are acting impatient like a child, and also like a child taking a simplistic black and white view on something based solely on the first academic thing written(and again, meant to only be an INITIAL INTRODUCTION TO) on something that is brand new, dynamic and evolving, and has had 7 years to grow and intergrate and change. Guess what? Most of the source code Satoshi wrote has been competely rewritten and replaced by other peoples. Satoshi is not god, and quite frankly I don't give a shit what is or is not in the whitepaper, I give a shit about bitcoin being designed to scale AND maintain the original design as much as possible (AKA, something peer-to-peer and not dependent on corporate sized nodes in data centers).

People like you are a joke. Whether you are simply naive, arrogant, or maliciously trying to derail actual conversation in discourse, it's pathetic. 
it takes 1-10 milliseconds to validate a signature. Lets assume 5 on average. Thats 1,500,000 seconds to validate 300 million transactions (a very modest daily amount for all Earth's global commerce, thats just ). THAT IS 416 HOURS to validate 24 hours worth of transactions.

I'm advocating scaling as much as possible in ways other than block size increases first, and then making as small of an increase as possible to keep the lowest operational costs possible, to allow for the most diverse and distributed ecosystem of nodes keeping the core blockchain as possible. If we can scale on top securely, and keep the demands of running the main blockchain low, its a win win, it scales and is secure from the influence of centralized powers.

Yes you will with the necessary BIP implemented which would allow channels to remain open indefinitely. In that situation, the ONLY channels regularly closing are ones where people tried to cheat.

Go look up how long it takes a bitcoin signature to be verified by a CPU, then go look at how estimates of daily transactions of currency on Earth, and then do the freaking math for validation times for different block sizes.

No, I don't KNOW that, because no one KNOW's that. 
Read my words again, your assumption about how Lightning Network would evolve and the reasons behind it is completely contradictory to the position you seem to hold about Bitcoin, that it can survive without centralized groups(companies running large scale nodes). 
No where did I say Bitcoin will only succeed with Lightning Network, I said it was something that should be built BEFORE picking a course on raising the blocksize limit. You are making wild assumptions about how potentially millions of people will act, yet call me naive. You completely make up shit and ascribe it as something I said, then you completely quote me out of context. 


That is the complete statement I made, not the out of context clip you took to falsely portray me as putting words in your mouth. I called out the hypocrisy in two contradicting positions you seem to hold, not ascribed an absolute statement to you.
People like you are nuts, you throw out wild assumptions completely lacking any factual basis, scream Blockstream conspiracy, and then twist the words of anyone engaging in discourse with you from an opposite point of view and storm off like a child "Done with a conversation" as if the other participant is the reason that dialogue is being stymied.

allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third  party.    Transactions  that  are  computationally  impractical  to   reverse   would  protect  sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.   In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The
system   is   secure   as   long   as   honest   nodes   collectively   control   more   CPU   power   than   any
cooperating group of attacker nodes
That is the purpose of bitcoin, not calculating the probability of something. It is to prove with CERTAINTY a RECORD. Why do you keep saying this all over there place? Yes, there are hypothetical solutions to build systems like that, they are not bitcoin. Bitcoin is for all PRACTICAL purposes about certainty, not probability.

Its not an option at the moment, no one is saying that its not an option period, they are just saying there is a lot more optimization that should be done first because it is more complicated recoding of the client to optimize data tranmission on the peer to peer network. They simply believe all of this should be done first, so that when the blocksize is raised the amount of added resource demands to nodes is as minimized as possible.

Bitcoin is global, there are many cultures, attitudes, and ways of seeing things on this planet.

FEES ARE NOT TOO EXPENSIVE RIGHT NOW. EVEN WITH A 100% increase THEY ARE NOT TOO EXPENSIVE. I have actually READ all of Satoshi's writings and posting, unlike alot of the Satoshi said idiots on this forum, and NOWHERE did he says Bitcoin was designed to handle low-fee transactions forever. He said "as long as possible," well stop being a baby and realize that maybe its not going to stay that way as long as you want. Developers are working on ways to allow users to transact without expensive fees, but you can go to hell if you think raising the blocksize limit until only a handful of datacenters on the planet can handle it is how to scale bitcoin. If thats what you think, you are an idiot. You optimize the way the clients handle datastructures, build in features, and THEN scale up WITHOUT completely ignoring the fact that blocksize directly correlates with resource demand of nodes. Without a lot of diversely placed nodes, Bitcoin isn't worth shit. If you do not see that, you do not understand anything being discussed here. 
And do not even think about breaking out that "But third world users argument", cause its bullshit. Right now Bitcoin fees are expensive to someone making less than 1$ a day, and even 3 cents is too much for them. They can use things like payment channel networks, or off chain transactions. Bitcoin is long past the day of being affordable to transact on chain for these people. 
Take a dose of reality.

You've just argued yourself in a circle essentially stating that Bitcoin won't succeed without big centralized companies/brands controlling it. Do you not grasp how small channels being opened between small groups and how exponential scaling of those multi-hop routes will in a very decentralized way allow the type of liquidity to spend disposable/small amounts of money without going through centralized hubs?
You started off with rational questions and statements, and have devolved into complete ad hominem attacks against Blockstream, assumed what EVERYONE else but you is going to do, and then contradicted yourself by making the argument users will only use Lightning Network(which is Bitcoin) with big brand name channels, but presumably assume the exact option when it comes to directly transacting on chain.

The microtransactions today are not of high quality, are not efficient, economically or technologically. One transaction that is less than a 1$ is not a stream of thousands of UTXOs worth less than a penny each. That is not the type of microtransaction being discussed when talking about micropayments using bitcoin. That is just the ability to move smaller amounts of money than you can with banks, the definition of micropayments you are using is the banking world's definition of a micropayment. Literally every single SPV wallet out there that tried to spend from a wallet that was funded solely by transactions worth a penny or less that added up to a significant amount of bitcoin would CRASH trying to spend it. 
People driving down the block to a corner store within walking distant are horrible inefficient, they exist. To scale bitcoin inefficient things have to be made efficient. Go look up the threads on bitcointalk and on this sub from coinwallets spam test where they distributed keys to wallets funded with nothing but tiny UTXOs like that. It is a technical problem that makes it not feasible(to be clear MICRO transactions, as in 1-2 cents or less than a cent at a time, not any transaction that is less than a dollar). You ignoring that technical problem doesn't make it go away.

The thing is, we don't want more microtransactions. When you can transact in fractions of a penny for things like streaming services metered, that adds up to a shit ton of transactions. Thats just not economically logical to pay a fee for each fraction of a penny every second instead of simply opening a payment channel, paying what you want, and closing it, only having to pay two fees. Not to mention getting into a world where those types of payments are common, and getting into the potential of machine-to-machine transactions, that microtransactions would infinitely outnumber people making regular transactions, and likely cause full blocks and the problems you speak of with confirmation lags, as well as waste a shit ton of money spent on unnessecary fees that destroy the entire economic feasibility of microtransactions. Not to mention the potential to doublespend and cheat content providers before they make it into a block, whereas the transfer of funds in payment channels is effectively instant, and the state of those settlements is designed to be almost impossible to cheat when closing out to the main blockchain. 
I do not simply "lack technical knowledge." You are failing to apply yours, microtransactions on the blockchain do not make since when payment channels exist for a multitude of reasons I've just scratched the surface of.

....Micropayments has absolutely nothing to do with merchants selling physical goods. It has to do with providing metered access to DIGITAL services/goods, such has streaming music, pay for use internet access, one time access to a streaming movie based on data use, etc. Almost NOTHING is being sold with micropayments at the moment, so it would just as easily work with Monero, Dogecoin, or any number of other altcoins specifically designed for micropayments or with them in mind. Getting your hands on them as a bitcoin user is as simple as a wallet and an app (Shapeshift).
Yes, bitcoinj requires the user having a wallet that can understand bitcoinj's function as server in the client/server micropayments model here. Lightning Network will require wallets understand Lightning Network, thats how these things work. Its called software.
Micropayments DO NOT make sense on the chain. Assume that your not transacting in insanely tiny amounts like a satoshi, just like 1/10th of a cent. Have you ever tried to spend a wallet full of a bunch of dust? Lets say optimally your pay half a penny tx fee, so you are already spending five times as much as you are sending for the fee, horribly inefficient, and because its not the average 3-5 cents unless things are really slow it won't confirm for a few blocks. So...you can double spend attempt after using 5 minutes of bandwidth and walk away without having paid if it goes through, security risk. Could do the same to record a song from the stream and just walk away having scammed them. As well, theres no guarantee that ALL of the payment will get confirmed, so you could pull off partial doublespends, don't have to scam them of the whole amount. 
Now on top of all of that, when you receive micropayments like that, each unspent output is a tiny amount that has to pay its own fee to move and consolidate, so your again looking at the person who RECEIVED the payment having to pay like 5x more than he'll end up successfully spending in fees just to spend it. Remember those coinwallet tests? The ones where they gave out keys to wallets with a shit ton of small UTXO? Yeah, wallets crashed, it cost like half or more of the money in those wallets to move the other half. And those amounts would probably be much smaller in the case of real micropayments.
Micropayments need INSTANT irreversibility and confidence in a transaction, and need to be magnitudes of order cheaper than fees are right now on the main blockchain, not cheap fees for macroscale payments and irreversibility after a few blocks that theres no guarantee the whole group of microtransactions will make it into together. 
Micropayments DO NOT make ANY sense on the main blockchain.

My point is that if we just raise the limit, nodes need more harddrive space and bandwidth. There are ALOT of nodes that are ran on virtual private servers, those could drop off very quickly if we start demanding more node resources. That might be fine with moderate increases, but it will have affects regardless. If we just get in the habit of raising the blocksize whenever more demand is created, that can get out of control. And that will make it impossible for new users to afford to be able to run a node. 1 GB blocks are 52 terrabytes a year if full, 2 GB blocks 104...so on. That will be expensive and centralizing.

No, I mean the more general accurate broad term for a market, a place of exchange. Where miners offer to exchange space in blocks for fees from users. You see, the block space doesn't just go up because demand does, unless the oppurtunity cost of doing so is outweighed by the gains. On the contrary, the price in terms of fee to get into a block goes up in whats called demand-pull inflation(inflation driven by the demand of a good outstripping the supply, in this case blockspace).
You can go ahead and quote narrowly specific definitions out of context somewhere else. I have take economics, and studied it pretty in depth.

If you do not understand what I spelled out there, what it means, and how to work that math out, and what that answer means, you do not understand bitcoin at all. 
If you scale up too big, it will take longer to verify transactions than they are coming in. Thats the exact same break everyone is bitching about with blocks being full, except it cannot be solved economically with a fee market, or technologically through top-layer or extension scaling solutions. It will FUNDAMENTALLY and PERMENANTLY break bitcoin. You cannot scale globally raising the blocksize, thats a fucking FACT. DEAL WITH IT.

See above comment on shitcoins as far as the code/chain distinction. 
As for the rest of the argument, this is largely technical but also largely semantical. In a way technically both would be bitcoin, but not. Both the new and old consensus rules would exist on seperate network, and there would likely be a pretty big amount of chaos dealing with all the software out there interacting with bitcoin. Semantically though, I'll quote myself from another reply here: 
But, semantically, the coin is defined by the nature of the consensus rules, nodes following those rules are what make up the network facilitating that coins existence. Currently core's consensus rules are that of Bitcoin. To fork away from that is to create an alternative consensus, and henceforth alternative coin. Whether or not that would become dominant is for the future to determine if it happens, but semantically, I call that an altcoin.

The entire idea of bitcoin is you can't censor transactions, if theres only a few nodes it becomes easier to force or conspire for nodes to do that. Another big idea is you can't change rules unless every node goes along with it, otherwise you fragment the network. With very few nodes, it is alot easier for nodes to be forced or conspire to change rules, i.e.: Change the 21 million limit, create black/whitelists so they can automatically flag coins and the protocol freezes and doesn't allow them to be spent, force ID compliance to use the network, so essentially turn bitcoin into a surveillance network.
A bitcoin that survives, but loses its decentralization, and becomes a few giant server farms in a few places, will likely turn into an orwellian nightmare rather than something that will help truly free markets and free money thrive to help the people.

Its no about whether its a good idea or not, its that when its implemented, it will be a part of the BITCOIN network, not some exterior network.

The Lightning Network IS NOT A SIDECHAIN. How many times does this have to be spelled out for people? It is trustless, as everything can be settled on the blockchain AT ANY TIME. Go actually fucking read something instead of parroting. Lightning Network is a top-layer network of payment channels BUILT DIRECTLY ON TOP OF BITCOIN. It is TRUSTLESS. Go actually read something instead of trolling on reddit.
And as for SegWit, it is only controversial because people have no clue what the hell they are talking about. Most major wallet maintainers already support it. It FIXES problems, it does not create them. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 07:02:52
This kind of terrifies me, because what it sounds like to me is that some very well funded people could essentially use a small portion of their own miners on an isolated node to do most of the work redoing old stuff, then dump a chunk onto the main network to raise the difficulty, and work that out to pool in with the isolated node on the alternate chain. If someone could build double the networks capacity in secret and power it up like that, I know we could hard fork back from the new chain, but I could also see that wreaking havoc through a whole ecosystem of apps and software.

Where's Armstrong's commits then? How much of the code has he read? Do any of these people even know the data serialization limit exists? 


Thats the last sentence from their "roadmap" on their site. That is not a TECHNICAL plan at all to solve ANY of the technical problems bitcoin has. That is a vague open ended statement. Whats their thoughts on the UTXO set growing? Transaction malleability? Providing an actually SAFE way for 0-conf transactions? What about node routing? Anyone from classic thinking about round-robin DNS routing to distribute SPV demand on nodes more evenly? Anyone thinking about replacing DNS-seeds with something a little more decentralized to make ACCESSING the node network less dependent on a centralized DNS service? Huh?
Classic is a crapshoot with absolutely no long-term plan at all, essentially trying to exert forcely a change from an established, laid out, well planned and long-term plan to SOLVE THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. And most of the companies supporting this are thinking about nothing but their bottom line, with absolutely no solution to the problems waiting to blow up in their face by equating scaling to raising the blocksize limit.

That metaphor is completely flawed. There is no fire, blocks sizes last year didn't get above 560KB on average. We're not even halfway to blocks being constantly full. IBLT is being done, thats one of those scaling solutions, and no one is sticking their fingers in their ear waiting for one particular thing, that particular thing happens to be the end of the road map after all the other things to make it work optimally are done. Like Segregated Witness fixing transaction malleability, and IBLT lowering bandwidth demands on nodes for relaying blocks, and a few other things streamlining how bitcoin works. Which means, when the blocksize is raised, it has less of a consequence on the node count.
There is no fire, there is no reason to put it out because it doesn't exist. As well, I am not confusing impatience for dealing with problems, you are making that confusion. Your entire reply to me was simply accusing me of being wrong, conceding to my statements, but not really, and then attempted to make me seem confused and misinformed while saying a whole lot of nothing. 
This entire tree of comments LITERALLY STARTED with me refuting your defense of on chain microtransactions, and you concede that you were wrong only to twist around and attempt to look more informed and "in the know" than me and paint me as confused and uninformed through metaphors and vague generalizations that say nothing concrete.

How is the old client supposed to view the post-fork block? Are they going to keep trying to include transactions in their block that are included in whats hashed in the coinbase? Can old clients even take into account those transactions? (Or is this just going to include those input/outputs into the coinbase tx and then the older clients see the mess of tx's greater than 1 MB as just a condensed merkle root of part of the coinbase?) 
Sorry for the million questions.

I will accept the semantics of that.
*EDIT* But, semantically, the coin is defined by the nature of the consensus rules, nodes following those rules are what make up the network facilitating that coins existence. Currently core's consensus rules are that of Bitcoin. To fork away from that is to create an alternative consensus, and henceforth alternative coin. Whether or not that would become dominant is for the future to determine if it happens, but semantically, I call that an altcoin.

He's talking about security of the network. Lets say we're in a world with 6000 bitcoin nodes in hundreds of countries. Almost impossible for a government to shutdown the network or impose through law changes to the protocol.
Lets say we're in a world with a dozen or two nodes in a dozen or two countries (who I think might likely be very Western), its ALOT easier to try and shut down the network, or force by law/international treaty/etc. changes into the protocol that we the users don't agree with. Imagine a debate like this going on now with scaling, except the cost to entry to run a node is maybe 5,000-10,000 entry for facility rent, 100,000s of thousands for server equipment, the cost of cooling equipment, electricity, network service(and at that scale you'd probably have to peer in with a higher tier network instead of going through an ISP, no idea how much that costs, but it is a fuckton.). Now imagine someone wants to do something you don't agree with. You can't spool up a node to run the software you support. They can pass laws to turn you into a criminal for running the software you want, or in the right political climate accuse you of treason, so the people who can afford nodes won't run the software you want. There's no choice anymore, just what can be imposed by, or onto the few capable of running nodes. 
Thats why Core is trying to approach scaling delicately, and do as much as they can without touching the blocksize limit first. So on a day like that you can afford to actually run a node and support the software you want.

I think the point he is getting at, is that quite frankly their opinions do not matter AS FAR AS getting the change implemented. As well, I'm seeing a lot of stupid suggestion/statements based soley on an individual perspective. In otherwords, people saying this will work for miners/nodes because I would find it acceptable as a miner or node operating, and not taking into account that other miners and others running a node have different thresholds for what they consider economic viability in continuing their operations. 
I work a dead end minimum-wage job right now inching my way towards a computer science degree, and am just starting to run a full node now, that will work with a 1 TB harddrive for a while to come. If the limits raised, and blocks start actually pushing towards filling that limit, then my computer is either nothing but a node, or has to have a new harddrive added roughly every year or so. In my current economic situation, I will not do that because I cannot afford it.
People need to step back and realize there are other participants in the network aside from themselves, and everyone has different amounts of money at their disposal to fund their efforts. Pushing changes because it makes sense for you doesn't mean it makes sense for everyone else in the network.

I just explained the math, go do it. There's a number of values to plug in for each variable. That's how verifying math works, you double-check it YOURSELF. It's finding a handful of basic values and doing basic arithmetic.
 Bitcoin is a flood fill network. They do not scale up, that's a fact. If you refuse to accept that, I suggest you go back to school and learn basic network architectures. I'm done engaging in discussion with someone who uses fluffy language to twist the basic procedures of science out of context. Flood fill networks do not scale, Fact. Not only a fact, but a fact backed up by decades of engineering work and theory.

We've encountered the problem, its the blocksize. And more research is needed, because that has consequences that ripple out to alot of the ecosystem. I don't get why you're pushing a hardfork now instead of being fine with waiting. Soft forking allows the features to get implemented, tested, developers get features working in software, and then clean up loose ends in a hard fork with a blocksize solution.

Decentralizing nodes is extremely important. A few servers in 3 countries is NOT safe politically from manipulation. Look at CISA recently passed by the US Congress, and the TPP waiting to be ratified, and how both of those are attempting to destroy privacy and freedom of speech online. Lets say theres some server in Iceland, America, China, and France? Switzerland was just pushed into legislating forced compliance with requests for information from banks, going back on a CENTURIES long policy of maintaining client secrecy. You think a few data farms couldn't be forced into changing client code to create black/whitelists? To change the issuance rate? To think that is naive, one of the things that keeps bitcoin secure is having lots of nodes so its hard to change things, if you only have a few server farms centralized in a few countries that becomes infinitely less secure.
Also, remember SPV clients will query nodes for for information/making payments, whats a more robust network design when that scales to hundreds of millions or billions of people? A few centralized servers that in the event of going down or losing network access could cripple the system through a chain reaction of overloading the rest of the nodes? Or at least make it inaccessable for a huge portion of users? Or 10,000 or more nodes distributing traffic load through round-robin DNS routing? 
Satoshi isn't a god, he was a person, and people are naive on certain subjects, they forget things, they miss details other don't, and sometimes just by looking at the same things differently arrive at wrong conclusions. Satoshi wasn't pefect, and wasn't right about everything. It is much, MUCH, more prudent to work on scaling with the least amount of centralizing effects possible first, and concede to centralizing only if thats the only option. 
If you have studied bitcoin as much as it seems you have, you should appreciate how completely Orwellian it could be if centralized too much and left open to manipulation and change after widescale adoption.

Miners were just as aware of those coming costs at 200$ as they are now at close to 600$. Better margins now, less of a harsh cutting room, but they have known about the coming cost increase for years. The dynamic you are discussing has been known and taken into account since Bitcoin started.

I completely disagree. The reason I feel there is no rush is because honestly there is so many ways to deal with scaling when you get to it its mind boggling. Whatever blocksize raise we get will likely be just a stop gap to cover things for a while. But fee markets are naturally the thing that will happen when he hit capacity ceilings, whether its before flexcap adjustments, at peak capacity, being above capacity before the next scheduled bump up. Fees could quadruple during huge waves of people buying bitcoin just to save (meaning a transaction or two), and I don't think its a big deal. When we get to the point of constantly being at capacity, not just hitting it occasionally due to spikes in transactions, .40$ transactions won't really be practical when the fee could get that high or higher. Hope for the best, plan for the worst.

I agree with both sides, the block-size needs to raised, but should be done conservatively to not unbalance the network.

I agree with both sides of the debate, I do not at all agree with Gavin or Hearn about anything except the fact the blocksize has to rise eventually, I do not trust them at all. They are attempting to pretty much bake into Bitcoin all the types of shit KYC/AML regulations would require of a company dealing with Bitcoin, right into BItcoin itself.

Quick summary of how a big chunk of our network works now: Alot of miners don't run their own nodes, they query other nodes to validate transactions and blocks and submit them to those nodes to broadcast to the network. That is DANGEROUS. Because blocks signed with XT support do not mean jackshit as far as representing what a miner votes for when they just grab a connection to the quickest responding node and pump out a block. They are being signed with that support by the node, not the miner, and as such nodes can be used right now as a way to manipulate miners into "supporting" something they do not, and force a fork with a much different hashing power split than 75% or greater versus 25% or smaller, and could even create a fucked situation where mining power is bouncing back and forth between chains which could severely fuck with the correct functioning of a lot of network hash power. This is incredibly dangerous, not to mention the fact that IP black/white listing for "peer-to-peer" node connections is also written into XT
I COMPLETELY AGREE BLOCKS NEED TO BE RAISED. This is not the way, these two are not trustworthy enough to be the ones to do it, and it should be done much more conservatively, actually looking at and acknowledging the state of the NETWORK as is, not our collective desire to have scaling problems solved ASAP.

Not in their pocket necessarily. He could just genuinely share enough of their view of bitcointalk and how it should work and evolve. 
Yes it's forkable, but if we see a bunch of forks over the coming years over hard-line opinions instead of consenting compromise then bitcoin will likely never be trusted by most people. Bitcoin is trying to be money, and as such is a political and social thing. Right now its tucked away in a tiny corner of the world barely known or understood by a majority of people. It is ripe to be manipulated socially and politically by self interested parties in this tiny corner before it is widely introduced to everyone else. Call me paranoid if you want, but historically paradigm shifting technologies have evolved in similar ways, the battle over control of something is usually said and done before people even know it exists or understand what it is.

Be careful, there is a fine line between being something you can caught for, and something that will just get coonbase closed. I'd advise trying to find someone on bitcointalk who mines and trying to swap coins with them, pay attention to the user reputation, its there's for a reason. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 05:24:48
False. Completely false, the last fork demonstrated the danger of SPV mining, something still done,and that comp!etely throws out the window the idea that miners are making the decision. Also, what is to stop people from bringing new nodes online for XT until it is a majority with no change on where miners stand? That throws out the idea this is in anyway democratic. This is plain and simple two developers using very well defined propaganda techniques to sway the opinion of people too uneducated to understand the implications to network stability as a whole. All it takes is a bunch of uneducated fanboys installing software to force a fork,that's in no way democratic, and in no way a well informed action.

Eh, I don't think so at all. Accurate sales info would be a good start. I think personally right now just based on my own anecdotal evidence of the situation, that were probably between 1/3-2/3 or 1/2-1/2 of the network being small scale individuals in pools and individuals owning massive farms. Kind of why I want to see 21 ramp up, even if they just subsidize the shit out of it to in ramp consumers to new products and services, I think without someone driving down the production costs and efficiency up of ASICs we'll see mostly individuals farms soon enough.
And that should be a very scary thought, because alot of governments have some equivalent of America eminent domain. I.e. we can take your shit whenever we want because we own everything anyway.

Without limits to the connections involved in the transaction, that is a semantically obvious sideline that I saw coming a mile away. And in terms of the network being a centralized middleman? I suggest you go to Wikipedia and read the pages on client-server connections and networks and peer-to-peer networks and look at the basic structure differences. There is no centralized or singular middle man or group of middleman who can damage the eventual success of that transaction unless a sizable majority of the entire network is composed of a singular actor. 
What you are doing here is simply introducing the same old semantically flawed arguments against bitcoin I've been seeing more and more here lately. Every rebuttal you have made here is rooted in nothing but semantics, and connects to no independent concept or logic of its own while pointing out no flaw in mine.

Mike and Gavin have inserted into XT support for nodes to run white and blacklists on ip addresses. This has been kept very low key.  I agree with everything you just said, but I do not trust those two even as much as I trust dogshit to stink. As well I think we need to be very conservative, not only because of node count and how that factors in, but the prevalence of SPV mining creates the dangerous potential of splitting the chain well below a threshold of 75% support for XT. Not to mention the fact that triggering it is as simple as plugging in around 18,000 nodes and can be done with 90% of users and miners disagreeing. Deep pockets could do that with a few virtual servers pretty easily. Mike and Gavin are either be deceptive or reckless, and I trust a person being exactly neither of those things.

No it doesn't go against what Bitcoin stands for, because if you completely unbalance the incentive mechanisms of the network you destroy all that value. You make it useless, you make it less secure, you open up a shit ton of attack avenues that did not previously exist. The token is a unit of account ON THE NETWORK. It is not its own independent thing, simply defining in simplistic terms such as money is dumbing down what it really is, A PART OF THE NETWORK. 
Sidechains don't just fuck with your tokens, they fuck with mine, they fuck with everyone's. You are arrogant beyond belief if you feel entitled to alter the nature of the network in a way that affects everyone, not based on your market activity, whether you buy or sell, but by your action to fundamentally alter the nature of the network. You fuck with me doing that, not just yourself. And that is fucking arrogant and self righteous beyond belief. 
And again by the way, you COMPLETELY ignore and step around the fact that the network and token are inseparable and work in tandem, and make an ad hominem plea to people reading based on the instinctual reaction to money as it exists now rather than the intellectual definition and distinction between Bitcoin and current money. Not to mention the complete strawman of accusing me of trying to prevent people accessing and controlling their own tokens on the network, WHICH IS IN NO WAY WHAT IS DONE BY MAINTAINING THE CURRENT NETWORK STRUCTURE. If people want to play around with different features, go use an altcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 00:27:21
Because its not their coins, its their KEY that allows them to move a token on the network. And no, private property does not grant absolute rights. Governments agencies can take your money, your land, your property, whenever the fuck they want. I have explained time and again, the TOKEN is a PART OF THE NETWORK, THE KEY IS WHAT YOU OWN. 
And again, let me fucking remind you, MY ENTIRE POINT IS THE NETWORK DECIDES THE VALUE. THAT IS FACT. That is the point you have ignored and refused to even acknowledge comment after comment. You refuse to understand how the NETWORK IS THE VALUABLE THING, THE TOKEN IS WHAT LETS YOU UTILIZE THAT VALUE. The token is notated on the network, NETWORK, which is where the value is STORED. On the network. NOT THE TOKEN. Those tokens are useless without it. 
You have done nothing but reply with ad hominems and completely ignored that entire CONCEPT.

What he is saying is that people can just be paid initially on LN. Essentially people in this situation only ever use bitcoin through LN, buying it, spending it, etc. Except to have to watch nodes to be able to submit a cancel transaction if someone tries to steal from the channel, they enjoy all the security of bitcoin and no exposure to anything but LN.

I don't think it'll lead to blockchain bloat at all. One of the things this network needs to do to diversify is diversify the types of nodes. As long as you have a decent internet connection it should be possible for a while to run pruned unspent output only nodes. That should be the most common node type, as it is the most important thing for regular users. Historical nodes would exist of course to be a back up security, historical nostalgia, because entities feel the need for that level of security. Then comes special purpose nodes. You could have nodes specifically to deal with XCP assets, or nodes specifically set up to hold onto "junk" data from things like the Eternity Wall. All the crap those special purpose nodes hold onto and use can be completely discarded by historical or pruned nodes, and special purpose nodes could be built on top of historical or pruned nodes depending on exactly what their function was.

I've looked a little into Monero, and I think I get the gist of it. But my overall point is that some idiot selling weed on a corner isn't going to know enough to use it securing to launder money, so far all intensive purposes its not really a good way to do that. Monero is one of the alts I've seen that I think actually brings useful features to the table, but I would still consider myself not a fan of alts. I'd like to see some of Monero's features tested in a sidechain definitely, but honestly looking at the things that Bitcoin will mostly be used for going forward I don't think complete privacy by default is a smart way to design the network. I do however believe there should be optional methods to achieve that through some mechanism, whether its stealth addresses, sidechains with different rules or what have you. 
Thanks for the clarification though, ignore the tangent if you want.

No offense but I'm not sure you understand how the lightning network works. First off its the same as using Bitcoin, your private key is still required for everything, it just allows less net transactions to have to be confirmed on the blockchain. As well, it is not some thing or company any party or group controls, it is simply a secondary protocol built on top of the main protocol of the blockchain to be more flexible but just secure. 
It doesn't take away power over anything, it just allows the network to scale more efficiently.

I hate to break it to you, but no. Its not their value. The network stores the value. They have access to it. Thats it. No one OWNS the value of their Bitcoin, they have ACCESS to it. The value is in the network itself. You as a participant do NOT own the entire network. Without that network, your tokens are useless and worthless. YOU are scaremongering, and quite frankly looking through your comment history just keep repeating the same shit with no explanation or conceptual clarification. 
You just go "Its theirs to do with they want with! And Bitcoin doesn't deserve to succeed if it can't survive that!" 
Sidechains fundamentally destroy the value of the Bitcoin, because they seperate the store of value (The network) and the tool people use to utilize that value (the tokens on the network) from each other. If you do not appreciate that, you do not understand Bitcoin.

Because I was doing both at the same time(waiting on support and talking to reddit), and was wondering if this was a result of them trying to add new features(which it turned out being) leading to some problem, or something people experience regulary. I was told that with the features they're trying to roll out for Purse Instant they haven't been spending as much time manually ensuring orders were confirmed when they should have been. Mine was one of them. Was resolved pretty nicely and they even covered overnight shipping to get my things out to me tomorrow.
As to the reason I didn't contact anyone before, I was unsure what the usual times were for things processing, so rather than blindly trust a websites About page, I came to ask people who've used it before. I didn't want to contact someone complaining when there was no reason to, but in the end it resolved itself pretty nicely.

Bold statement. Explain how they aren't as secure? They use private keys, if you attempt to lie about the balance and take more than you're entitled a channel you forfeit ALL the money you have in the channel. You just made a bold blanket statement with no fucking explanation, and used wild hyperbole as well. 
No programmable money? Why is that? Explain how delegating scripting to a secondary layer just like permenent confirmations in a block is making programmable money impossible? All that changes is instead of those more complex transactions being scripts run totally on the chain, they are now dependent on smarter wallets being participants in a script, and guess what, smarter wallets were going to be needed anyway. 
Everyone attacking LN has either no basis in fact for their accusations, or quite frankly doesn't understand it at all.

That is the shittiest metaphor ever used. And it doesn't apply. Its not bridge cables, its bandwidth and storage space. So of the two kinds of "BRIDGE CABLES" you can use, one(storage) is only useful if all the node operators out there buy it individually and install it. The other, bandwidth, it something in a lot of places that is situationally completely beyond the control of the node operator, they have the bandwidth ranges their available service providers can provide, and that’s it. A node operator cannot just rip up the fiber or coaxial lines going back to their provider and replace them with higher throughput cables.
It's not just "walk down to the hardware store and buy steel cable." That is a bullshit analogy and a complete oversimplification.

@_date: 2015-07-31 23:16:50
No it doesn't only affect those who that value belongs to. It affects the entire network and the value of the ENTIRE NETWORK, meaning alot more than those who own value they're putting on a side chain. It destroys the economic value of the Bitcoin network, it destroys the balance of miner incentive, it completely DESTROYS BITCOIN. A blockchain is a network made up of tokens being spent and their current unspent outputs being recorded within the blockchain. That is the ENTIRE BASIS of the value of a cryptocurrency, the security of a the blockchain and the ownership of the token. When you remove the token from the network, you completely destroy that balance. You completely destroy the formula that CREATES VALUE FOR THAT NETWORK.

You are completely lacking a fundamental grasp of economics and how the Bitcoin network is structured. ITS NOT THEIR COINS. ITS SOMETHING THEY CONTROL ON THE NETWORK. IF THAT NETWORK IS GONE, THEY DO NOT HAVE SHIT. 
Deal with it, because that is reality. The network is valuable. You can utilize that value with tokens on it you control, without the network that token is WORTHLESS. That is exactly how you trade it in, spend it, buy altcoins with it, BY USING THE NETWORK. NOT THE TOKEN ITSELF.

I think moving forward we need to find a balance on how to actually provide personal privacy to consumers so their entire life is not an open book, but to some degree we do need to maintain a level of transparency and openness in how these networks function. As much as my response to people saying things like "Bitcoin is just for terrorists and criminals" is Fuckoff and look what currency they use now, terrorists and criminals are still social problems that are real. I believe the benefits to society as a whole are much greater and worth the trade off to allow cryptocurrencies to benefit criminals or terrorists, but that doesn't mean that is the end of it. That doesn't mean we as a society just step back and not deal with those threats, we need to start thinking about how police/governments/voluntary groups or whatever the hell will be enforcing laws in 20 years can still tackle the problems of crime and terrorism in a way that doesn't compromise the general publics privacy and secure use of these technologies. 
These are the things we as a community need to think about and discuss before compromises to the network are made that didn't have to be.

I don't think Proof of Stake will work with something that's main purpose is to function as a currency or payment network. If you are talking about some other type of network simply trying to protect against DoS by creating an artificial scarcity using tokens, then as long as the buy in to start staking is not too high to prevent new users, I think proof of stake could work very well and efficiently for other blockchain systems.

I don't mean to be condescending, as I'm not an expert myself more a hobbyist, but in my personal experience way too many people I know invested in bitcoin or involved in it are almost completely technically illiterate(not to say they are old people level computer ignorant  Bitcoin at the end of the day is a computer network with lots of complex moving parts, you do not actually own bitcoin, you own a key to access an account on that network. Too many people in this debate are simply overlaying the conceptual understanding of money as it is now onto bitcoin, or equating it to nothing but a payment processing network, and these are incorrect assumptions. It is a computer network, and access and userbase are what defines the value of it. The stability of the network is what encourages both.

Okay, I get what you're saying. But I am not in a legislative body, and stopping activity I don't like aside, I do not want to be involved in that activity myself personally. I'm worried if a Monero like solution to privacy is pushed as a default rather than option, then I will be unable to properly judge whether an activity I am considering becoming involved in is one I would like to be involved in or not.
What if someone wanted to buy some stocks on Counterparty off me, and I am looking at a market I think is about to boom off but don't mind selling a portion of for some quick cash as I've already made profit, just not as much as I could. 
I'm worried about a world where my only option to do that is putting on a sell order on a totally anonymous decentralized marketplace where everything is automated, I do not do anything but confirm or deny a purchase attempt, and thats it. With Bitcoin as it stands now, I could try to ascertain whether those coins are coming from a wallet owned by a group or individual I personally would not want to sell that to. With a Bitcoin that works more like Monero, I am unable to do that. I am unable to make a personal choice to sell this stock to some father in Europe instead of an ISIS member in Syria, because there is no way for me to attempt to find those connections. With Bitcoin as it is, there is no guarantee I could actually make a connection to make a proper judgement, but its at least possible. 
If there was just a Bitcoin sidechain functioning like Monero, as opposed to the main chain, I can just make the decision to not involve myself with transactions there unless I can find other means of verification to personally satisfy me. The more private you make things by default without a user having to safeguard that privacy personally, the more you build a system where its essentially "You could be supporting or doing business with someone you don't want to, so either don't use this or deal with it." At least thats how I see it. I'm not sure how I feel about a network that functions like that, simply as a user. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 01:01:29
Well then you and I fundamentally disagree about alot of the world.

We will still have geographic areas with different wanted laws and lifestyles. I don't think we should build a world where you can NEVER tell or piece together the history of moneys circulation. You may take this as me not wanting to maintain perfect fungibility, but I don't think allowing me to decide to refuse to accept money from an individual affects the fungibility of those unspent outputs. It just means I want the option to be able to refuse to deal with an individual in a transaction. If they somewhere down the line wind up in the hands of someone I would like to do business with, I will accept them then. But in the end I think making perfect privacy the default instead of an option, through an altcoin or sidechain, is not providing freedom of choice. It is limiting the choice. 
I should have the right to say "I will not accept these coins as long they are controlled by this individual," and if the blockchain is changed in a way that it is completely 100% private and untraceable, I am prevented from making that choice. I cannot decide based on anything but the money being given me and whether I want it or not to inform my decision to be involved or not with another actor in the market. And at the end of the day, isn't a market supposed to be composed of different actors WILLINGLY exchanging value and goods?

Sorry for all the typos ahead of time, sick as a dog and didn't feel like proof-reading. 
1) So essentially, if someone doesn't cooperate they lose money too? Why would they do that? And also the more you look at the potential for big capital holders to set up wide spread hubs for a small equivalent fee offchain(Which they at the end of the day can either keep by minimizing on train confirmations to pass that onto the miners, or pass it on the miners during daily/weekly resets and clearings.) Think long term about the incentive this creates to not leave large amounts of capital sitting around instead of using them.
2) Sure they can, you just simply build some of that scripting functionality into the wallets instead of depending on it all working on chain. Yes, quick patch, not long term solution, but in the end if someone has your wallet compromised to fuck with that, they have your keys also, so your burned anyway. (Hell, even just got a goofy idea to edit in, have your wallet generate specific keys only used to confirm identities in handshakes directly between wallets)
3) Uhm...most people in the developed world are online all the time. And if most people are using wallets on their phones, thats going to be the case. Thats just excessive paranoia. Thats like saying keys need to be made more secure because using one forever could make it less secure. Flawed logic, solution is use different wallets, thats not a security flaw in the sense it needs to be fixed if it happens, thats user error for not operating their wallet properly. 
4) Again, then don't have a channel that stays open literally forever. Find the time line you find suitable for your use of it, and close and reopen with a new address periodically.
-Yeah its not ready now, because its being built right now. Everybody with this bullshit debate is becoming way to evangelistic and ignorant. If you're not in principle against solutions like that, then help make this one understand and help it get to the point of testing it. NO ONE KNOWS FOR A FACT the best way to scale this network, and everyone on both sides of the debate is screaming back and forth like they do. 
This is a beta test, the entire Bitcoin network is still a prototype. So you know what we should do? Keep testing it, keep building new shit. Lighting Network could have security flaws or exploits in it conceptually, so lets build it and try and find them. 
Changing the block size fundamentally alters the way blocks perpetuate across the network between nodes and mining pools, altering the variables miners look to in the gigantic game theory that is that eco-system. It WILL change their behavior, and WILL alter the required resources to run a node. Down the line I think there will be historical full nodes, there will be pruned nodes with just the unspent outputs, there will be nodes that save up all kinds of junk data for totally unrelated services on the blockchain that historical and pruned nodes ignore and don't save. Point being, this is a very complex network I envision, and getting there will be very delicate work. 
No matter what side you are taking in this debate, action either way fundamentally alters the balance of the ecosystem. In the case of the lightning though, it only affects those who use it, so building it and testing it has a much smaller range of potential consequences.
In the case of raising the blocksize, that fundamentally changes the ENTIRE network, and affects ALL users. That is something to be much more conservative about.

Its an open system to USE bruh. Not just alter. That creates A NEW SYSTEM. Classic has almost no actual data to back their case AT ALL. Just "2 MBs is fine, it won't centralize things too much." There are boat loads of data showing how shitty throughput on the network as a whole is, shit, someone had to build a centralized relay network of nodes to help miners not lose money to high orphan rates, at less than 1 MB. Core developers have made, and are BUILDING better ideas while maintaining a reasonable tradeoff between scaling and decentralization. Classic simply claims there is no trade off, hit the switch. *EDIT* (And keep in mind, once that damage is done to decentralization, there is no undoing it. Period.) And instead of looking at the data, and supporting themselves with that, they are lobbying private companies with a conflicting self interest to disregard the tradeoffs in scaling in favor of their own profit. 
Classic is a joke.

While I appreciate what you are doing here, I completely disagree. He is ignoring the advice of people more educated them him, and refusing to drop it when everyone else has decided to accept that advice. Why couldn't Coinbase work on a LN implementation? There's 3 out there being coded last I checked. Open source. Pick it up and keep running with it. You can open a channel with only one side funding it, so there is a way for Coinbase to save money not eating fees for withdrawals. They can provide liquidity as a payment hub. And they can be a big player in pushing an actually secure form of zero confirmation(payment channels). This would actually cut costs, increase security in a few cases, and get the community moving forward. 
Instead, he whines and complains and tells the people diving through bitcoin's source code for the past 5 years, they are dead wrong. He's incompetent, and being childish as hell.

RBF is a necessary feature going forward, and your statement about a large portion of people not wanting it is totally anecdotal. Classic's position is businesses with run nodes. Did you know Coinbase didn't even run their own node until Peter Todd kept fucking with their servers? Again, look at the EVIDENCE, not opinion, that when the soft-cap was raised people stopped working on things like CPFP and RBF when the code is already two years old or more. Look at Gavin's commits lately, its almost jackshit. Most of the work he did in the first place wasn't even writing new code, it was trimming down and fixing Satoshi's code. He's also not a cryptographer, with most of the important code in bitcoin being CRYPTOGRAPHIC. What this boils down to is you want to have everything dumped on the chain for free forever. Well too bad. Math doesn't work like that, it doesn't just add up to whatever you want because you want it. The current state of the network is what it is, regardless of your "opinion" on that. And I will not stand by and watch people destroy it because they refuse to accept a reality that is less rosy than they wanted.

Lets say that getting a loan through a bank he needs to get a background check, prove good credit, put up collateral for a loan, then work all those bullshit costs into his business model. Thats how the bank system works now. 
Now the bank system on Bitcoin? People from all over the world can send him a few dollars without an interest back, without requiring paying them back period, without a background check, credit history, or collaterall, and he can just start his fucking restaurant.

Gavin and Jeff are also not cryptographers and not as good at programming as alot of the rest of the guys. I'm sorry, thats just true. I'm not saying they have nothing to contribute, but they are not qualified to steer the ship. 


So what? This isn't the lightning network I'll be using, as peer-to-peer as possible with as many channels as I can open with individuals. Coinbase would be a hub. They would have all their customer records, they would be able to comply with KYC/AML. This line of reasoning is a non-starter. 


False and false on the two note. I use Coinbase because of no fees. Would not if they charged. And yes it is an issue. Have you ever ran a business? Its money they have to eat as an expense that under this business model they wouldn't. Thats an issue, and thats a solution to it. And depositing money with customers would not be "keeping it with coinbase" it would be on a wallet on your device, with keys you 100% control, holding fees on a payment channel. The only way that would be connected to Coinbase is the fact they funded the channel, and they act as the hub for a network of channels. Thats it. 


The fee market thing is the only position you take that I can accept as founded in a logical opinion. I disagree with that. If users don't get used to having to deal with it(even if its just bidding in a range of 10-20 cents during peaktime), they will bitch and moan and scream ten times louder to keep fees low. And frankly, from where I'm standing and how the property lines of this network lay out, if people think they are entitled to just throw as much data as they want at my node for free, they got another thing coming.

Here's a few reasons why that's not naive: 1) Banks are companies, companies formed and held in certain countries with all the attached histories and paranoias of other governments and possible ties they perceive between those banks and host governments. You are essentially saying that GOVERNMENTS and their citizens will trust private currencies issued and controllable by private companies of certain countries. False. Will never ever ever ever happen. Ever.
2) One of the biggest possibilities of Bitcoin beyond just a peer to peer currency is a token system to run a totally decentralized stock market. The biggest potential here is a truly singular international stock market. Now, will all the disparate countries of the world trust a blockchain(s) controlled by private companies centered in a handful of nations around the world? Fuck no. They're going to choose to use the blockchain that is globally decentralized, and world governments will support and incentive the blockchain that is more decentralized, as it is in the best interest of national economic security. 
3) More general and not a specific point, the whole advantage aside from being cheaper, is enabling globally interactive economic activity. Governments, the ultimate arbiters today of how global trade works, will not support as a whole a system that centralizes new economic networks in the hands of a few when there is the alternative available to distribute that and decentralize to a lot higher order.  That's essentially saying, here, we have a way to not get fucked in the ass anymore! But lets just get fucked in the ass by a different dick!
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:08:43
1. Okay, this is one valid point meaning escrows like this would essentially be something you paid a little premium for, but in the case of a widely used payment network hub you connect to, I don't really see a case where you put money in and spend NONE of it, so in essence the payment hub could subsidize your transaction fee on main chain for closing the channel. This would allow markets to discover whether or not the amount of people never pulling money off the payment hub could subsidize people who do by taking fees from everyone in channel network and subsidizing the main chain fee for cashing out. 
2. See but this is a service that can be offered free, or done yourself on a home computer, or done as a small scale business, or something a company does as a cost of running business. Just in the basic possibility of that service existing, there are an insane variety of ways they can be provided all across the spectrum of centralized/decentralized, which as much as people like you and me would like to scream perfect decentralization, that availability of spectrum is clearly how Bitcoin is and will continue to be evolving. 
3. Not necessarily at all. I could be some rich rich bastard with trillions of dollars of assets and billions of dollars of liquid cash. I just buy Bitcoin at a steady rate to not wildly upswing price, and spam the network with junk transacations using all of it. And just keep doing that. That would fucking destroy Bitcoin. 
4. So then here's what we should be doing: working to implement alternate solutions as is, and test the shit of them. Refine them, now, as soon as possible, stop complaining about how it doesn't work now, and pointing fingers at people involved with Blockstream as if they are poisoning Bitcoin. They are trying to see if this thing is workable as fast and possible, so if it isn't, move onto the next thing. I am honestly much more worried about Gavin having some agenda in line with what the CIA and NSA would want to do with Bitcoin. And I don't mean in the sense that he's a plant or spy, just someone with a similar world view to them who would want to take Bitcoin into a much more blacklistable and centralized position. I am so much more concerned with Gavin and Mike just totally ignoring the implications to node decentralization and count and the challenges to running them and how that might affect the network as a whole. Here's what I think we should do with the blocksize limit: Start with 1 MB to 2, coded to at a later date to move to 4 mb, then 8 MB as the furthest it goes. It should be an incremental increase with miners tagging blocks voting to increase to the next or not, with thresholds at each increase. That way, its slow and gradual, allows quick scaling consequences be damned if necessary, but allows itself to be stopped if enough people decide the negative consequences to the network are greater than the positive. 
At the end of the day, we have to realize that consensus is either willing compromise or fascism. I'm not a fan of fascism.
*RANDOM THOUGHT* Just throwing out a random thought I've only talked over with one person concerning sidechains. I'm really scared of sidechains totally fucking the entire balance of the network. One way of I think reducing risk to the main chain be building in some mechanism to the side chain essentially paying the main chain in form of capital decaying away from everyone on the side chain to the main chain in little burst transactions, rewarded to whatever main chain miner solves the block that burst transaction is in. This way they remain somewhat inflationary in a way so are incentivized to actually serve a purpose rather than hijack Bitcoin with an altcoin thats easier to move to, as they pay that out to the main chain miners.

I was referring to withdrawal fees in a world where fees are more in the order of 4-5$. If they did not have the option to open a channel to me, and I had to eat that every time instead of simply being cashed out through payment channels, I would find that a poor service.
Optimizing something like Factom is good, keep working on it. But I'm referring to the idea that right now I run a node. I intend to keep running it. I will support code that allows me to do that. That in my mind leads to small blocks, layered scaling, and a fee market. You are not entitled to store anything on my computer unless I so choose to let you by running a node. If you want to say my argument is fallacious, my response is have fun with whatever centralized surveillance network comes out of continuing to "keep things free/cheap as long as possible." The more people you bring onboard, and get used to that, who are unaware of the fee market and its necessity to 1) make up a big chunk of miners income longterm, and 2) maintain a degree of decentralization to maintain bitcoins inherent value, the more people will fight against it, and the more momentum you give the userbase pushing bitcoin into a centralized controllable network. Which is essentially more efficient than our current system in no way except in respect to surveillance.

Because its not just the block propagation, its the verification of all the signatures and histories of every UTXO in the block. That is bottle necked by the CPU. Even with a internet where anyone on Earth can get 1 Gig downloaded in a second, that CPU bottle exists. While bandwidth is a huge factor, it doesn't really matter, because even if that is solved the CPU verification speed is what it is, and each successive node relaying things has to independently verify everything before it relays. So instead of just worrying about bandwidth, you also have to worry about the delay on each jump while the node verifies before relaying. That is a huge problem(which is why Core replaced OpenSSL with their own library). 
As for your assessment of mining, thats essentially where I stand. Except most people forget that moore's law is hitting a brick wall, eventually ASICs will not be able to be shrunk down more, the market will saturate, and prices will come down and help re-decentralize mining. 
As far as new users bringing new nodes, that will only work to a point. Hanging out in the irc channel all the time, it is a multiple daily occurance to have new users be confused by Core's requirement to DL the blockchain, are unaware of its role as a node, and only downloaded it because it was the "recommended wallet." Most users don't care about running a node, and the bigger the blockchain gets the less people will go through the effort to bootstrap one. They'll opt for SPV. This is historically what has happened so far. 
I apologize for my tone, but these days its hard to remember people don't know everything I do(which is not too much), and with all the trolls lurking about I suffer from a short temper alot. I apologize for that.

A PERSON is ingenious. Humans collectively are stupid. Already we depend on a centralized relay circuit to relay blocks with low orphan rates. The amount of nodes that cannot relay blocks at all within reasonable time rates considering an acceptable orphan rate is in excess of 50%. Already a large portion of nodes are not maintained and updated, this will cause backwards compatiblity problems eventually no matter what. There's still no real solution to evenly distributing SPV demand amongst nodes, guess what, thats a potential cascading failure waiting to happen in a world of heavy bitcoin adoption and heavy SPV adoption(which is what has happened, is happening, and will continue to happen). This network is insanely fragile at the moment. Robust, adaptive, yes. But very fragile facing the potential of a rush to the on ramp. The blocksize limit makes these potential problems worse when its raised. As well, that is not a route to SCALE. Thats a route to increase throughput. Not the same thing. No matter what we do the core network will never handle global throughput. Scaling will not be solved with a blocksize raise, and that raise will create more problems that can technically blow up in our face down the road, and incentivization-wise negatively affect the amount of people willing to run a node.

Yes I can. Something like 5% of nodes can relay blocks at an orphan rate of .05%. At 1 Freaking MB. Making blocks bigger before we implement space optimization through SegWit, and improvements like IBLT to block relays, WILL DAMAGE THE NETWORK. It could potentially double the bandwidth demands of nodes online, and I again point to the figure of reliable nodes as far as miners are concerned. They currently rely on a CENTRALIZED mesh of nodes to counteract that. At 1 MB. 
Core IS NOT REFUSING A HARDFORK INCREASE. They are not going to do it NOW, because thats a stupid move. You add costs to nodes that CAN be fixed first, so that with a hardfork blocksize increase it does less damage to the network in terms of making nodes cost more to run in terms of resources.

The entire argument behind Classic is bullshit. Here's some REAL scaling problems: The UTXO set. Classic's response: BLOCKSIZE EMERGENCY! Another real problem: how blocks are relayed between nodes. Classic's response: BLOCKSIZE EMERGENCY!!! The client's data structure limit. Classic: BLOCKSIZE EMERGENCY!!!!!!
You see the pattern here? People try to solve problems much more urgent for bitcoin scaling than the blocksize, and how does Classic respond? "GAAAH! BLOCKSIZE!!!!" It's short-sighted populist bullshit that will cripple the network in the long term if it succeeds.

That thread is nothing but an echo chamber of "We're right!" and nonsense. The safe limits the network can handle ARE NOT ARBITRARY. They are PROVEN LIMITS backed up by DATA that show after a point, around 3 MB, the network starts to suffer from slower propagation times and higher orphan rates. That is A FACT OF PHYSICS. That is not an opinion, that I am entitled to, that is a FACT. Using the phrase "We're each entitled to our opinions" does not just magically negate facts.

Counterfeit cash is not something that is inconsequential, North Korea crutches up a huge part of the economy with it. As well, accountability. You gloss over and ignore that word. With cash, a government budget can be fudged with and no one knows whats going on. With Bitcoin it can't be. Everythings public. With cash, companies and banks can cook books and lie about cash on hand, how solvent they are are. With Bitcoin, on a blockchain, they can't. Its all public. 
You completely fail to even try to understand what he meant by that word, you just point at Mt. Gox and go "Something bad happened, see? I'm right." A blockchain completely alters the way that economies and markets can run from the scale of a single business to an entire countries budget. That is not possible with cash as it exists now, digital or paper. 
But then again, you don't really care about the billions of dollars that can be saved doing away with wasteful practices and procedures, you don't really care how much more accountable a government would be with a budget on a blockchain, you just see that its likely not something that will make you rich and require you to learn something, so you go WAAAAH, no, I don't wanna.

A pruned node becomes useless if it drops off the network, and still needs full nodes. Pruned nodes are only useful if a large enough percentage stay online reliably. Once they drop off if they are updating basEd on pruned nodes thats a problem, and if pruned nodes lead to full nodes declining thats a worse problem.
No one on either side here is considering balance or security at all, every idiot is bandying their pet idea around without considering how it affects either quality of the network.

......you are an idiot. Seriously. Its like what I say goes in one ear and out the other.  First, BANDWIDTH, not processinn power, not storage is te problem.  
If miner a can handle 20 MB Blocks, and miner b can only handle 10, miner a will set a soft cap at 20, and miner b at 10.  Eventually miner b will get run out of business, and then network is more centealized. What the fuck is wrog with your brain that you cannot understand this.
How about you diont pretend you know a damn thing about mining infrastructure when clearly you dont.

Doesnt matter, full nodes still need to exist to bootstrap pruned nodes. As well, right now pruned nodes are not validating anything, just relaying blocks.
@_date: 2015-09-05 21:46:43
If you dont care about this, you dont belong here. You completely fail to grasp the dangeerous part of this, if the cap is 20 mb, and 1/3 of miners cant handle blocks that big, the rest of the network can choke them out and further centralize mining. The blocksize should not increase without a majority of miners being able to handle the new cap, or you dangerously change the game theory motivating miners. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 23:31:29
Yes they are an issue, because numbskulls like you live in fairytale land where the future exists now. It doesnt, technological developments are nothing more than predictions, they are not facts, and not something to base an argument on.

those nodes do nothing bit relay blocks, without confirming transactions and blocks that is just a token gesture.

The network doesnt get slow, you have to pay a few more cents to use it. Deal with it, thats life.
@_date: 2015-09-04 05:31:13
No its not, paying 5 cents a transaction instead of 1 is still dirt cheap, and is a source of revenue for miners to upgrade connectivity and equipment to handle bigger blocks.

THI IS NOT SAFE!!! Everyone out there stop trying to spin up shit tons of nodes and overstretch your financial  ability to maintain them. That is NOT helping. All you are doing is falsely  inflating one of the most important metrics of network security. What happens when you go broke, and we all find out half the nodes out there are run by a handful of idiots running them on VPSs? Then the network is worse of, and it blindsided those trying to maintain it. Cloud nodes are a dumb idea and do not help the network. They create a false picture of a diversenode count where one does not exist.

Are you kidding me? That coins looks like a joke. Sounds like it implements features that could be implemented by Bitcoin, which one kills a chance at adoption. And two, it doesn't even say on the site or its encyclopedia what the mining process is, PoW or PoS, what encryption it uses, etc. And I shouldn't have to dig through a forum to find these things, if you're thinking right now about pointing to something on the forum. 
If this coin is at all serious, get better at explaining it, and displaying information in the appropriate place in an easy to understand way. And then again, the entire building up companies and infrastructure and such necessary to interact with the current financial systems, which is the only way ANY coin will gain adoption. Which no other coin except Bitcoin is doing in any serious way. Good luck.

And he didn't go buy the laptop himself...so "factory sealed" doesn't mean shit. No it didn't "check out" a laptop that Gavin did not guarantee was brand new himself said it was valid.
Gavin is an idiot. What he should have done was bring his own device, with his own software preloaded that he validated himself. Not to mention the fact that Electrum servers show no software download in the UK on that date.

1) The idea you are calling **a core developer** a scammer is a joke Jihan. (And as well, he did not mean you are all a single pool as in: You are all just pretending to be different pools. He meant that on a technical level because of the fact you connect stratum servers together, there is no **technical** difference between you being separate pools or not. He is not accusing anyone of being deceitful, he is simple pointing out a technical fact.) Patrick is a very intelligent person, and probably the person I've seen do the most research into the peer-to-peer network aspect of Bitcoin. 
2) Protocol development **is not centralized**. Anyone telling you this is a liar, and if you honestly believe this, you are wrong. **Anyone** can write code for Bitcoin, absolutely **anyone** who is able to write code. But guess what? That in no way guarantees that anyone will actually run that code. Core being the dominate client is not because "development is centralized." That is completely and utterly false. It is the dominate client **because that is what people choose to run.**
3) A number of mining pools in China have done questionable/un-ethical things in the past Jihan. Do not deny this. Block withholding is an attack, and it has been noticed by Kano many times over the past few months. Users will not trust a Bitcoin with a very centralized group of miners, and many people already think miners are too centralized. This kind of behavior will run smaller miners out of business, further centralizing mining, and weakening people's confidence in Bitcoin as a whole. 
I am not aware of how closely you have been following the conversations in this community, but you have not been active in participating in them for very long Jihan. To come to a public forum like this, and start making vague generalized statements, after not participating in conversations here, and I assume not following this conversations, is foolish and destructive. 
If miners decide to fork away from the rest of the nodes on the network, it will kill Bitcoin Jihan. What is important to consider is the **node count**. An internet forum is the most useless place on Earth to gather information about how to proceed with Bitcoin. If you think I am wrong about that, I will happily start creating many different accounts and making it look like me, one individual, is many different people all holding the same view. It is not difficult. 
To act based on what you read in a forum like this, or any online forum, is incredibly foolish Jihan. If you want to look somewhere to inform your decision, look to the network and the nodes. Not easily manipulated public forums, that my government, and I am sure your government as well, have been manipulating for their own reasons for years.

I would just like to point this out: [Why is no one freaking out about this?](  The **second** I saw this announcement on twitter, which I think is great news and logical given the escalating contentious nature of the scaling debate, I knew this was going to happen. Everyone would freak out about a company designed to maintain the protocol, and offer specialized services built on top of it, patenting things. But not the **exchange** whos business model is totally built around low fees, and would have every incentive to to *externalize the cost of their business model(lows fees)* to the commons(people's nodes) rather than pay for the fees to maintain security of the network their business is built on, **patenting the most basic aspects of bitcoin itself**.
Why is everyone freaking out about the company that has calmly and coolly churned out code, pushed for discussion, and had a consistent plan, patenting things to let everyone use for free? But the company that has time and again fucked over customers, pushed for reckless changes to the protocol, constantly moved the bar of these changes they pushed for to whatever they think will happen soonest(again, because their business depends on cheap fees, externalize that cost so we don't have to pay it when fees go up quick!!!), and done things like [hire someone with a few months javascript experience to maintain and build things for a company **holding 10% of all bitcoins!!!**](

Bitcoin. is. **NOT**. a. democracy. It is a technical protocol for transferring value. Sorry if some bartender is butt hurt their opinion is being ignored on how to scale a global peer-to-peer network, they have no idea what they are talking about. 
Here's your three options: 1) Use it. 2) Don't use it. 3) Go make your own cryptocurrency.

Again, force feeding a troll informatin: 
*You* are the one who is insulting people, by accusing them of insults when *all I am doing is pointing out the irrational nature of your statements*. 
*They plan to start a pool where many companies can have patents held by an outside party* Something you would know **IF YOU READ ANY OF THAT**. 
Cut the grand standing bullshit. You are spreading misinformation and bullshit based on your conclusions, WHICH ARE DRAWN FROM INCOMPLETE INFORMATION. **READ SHIT** instead of demanding someone else does it for you. You are lazy beyond belief if you have this pious attitude that you can demand people summarize things they read for you in long diatribes, but refuse to actually read them yourselves.
I am not insulting you, I am pointing out the completely disingenuous nature of your "questions" here. Deal with it like an adult.

False. Coinbase did not run a node until they were literally actively attacked to force them to(You know, the exchange that holds 10% of BTC?). They then tried to write their own node. It sucked ass, and constantly forked. Businesses generally try to skimp out on costs as much as possible, including running nodes. *Users* need to run nodes.

Uhmm...just wanna point out guys. Make sure your photos are not geotagged, as you are pretty much advertising your physical location *and* the fact that you likely have bitcoin. There have already been a few attempts at robberies luring people in with this game. Everyone playing out there, remember be aware and be careful. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:02:23
Are you nuts? They are developers, their job is to see what is possible and not possible. How things work, or can be made to work. Did it ever pop into your brain that something like this could be **necessary in the future** if mining centralizes too much(and remember, its already very centralized, something people either gloss over or focus on depending on how it suits whoever's position)???

So apparently we also have to be taught about clicking on links(all in the blog post): 
(And also, the funny part, I don't downvote. EVER. So that is just people who agree with me.)
*EDIT* This is the type of shit I mean. There **ARE THE BLOG POSTS FROM THE COMPANY THEMSELVES, GET OFF YOUR ASS AND READ THEM.** You troll around spouting nonsense based on admittedly incomplete fact sets and demand to be spoon fed the entire content of websites and legal definitions **INSTEAD OF GOING THERE YOURSELF WHEN POINTED AT THEM**. You are a damned fool, and the only way you can try to paint yourself as not a fool, is simply twisting people's irritation at your expectation of being spoon fed as some kind of tribalistic persecution. When it is simply frustration with someone who will not take the slightest effort to seek out a fact, and instead spouts nonsense demanding others spoon feed them those things they refuse to take a split second of effort to find themselves.

Dude...I'm not trying to be a dick. But be real. Moderation was done more actively because you had people dropping into every unrelated thread starting arguments over blocksize, the front page spammed with nothing but "RAISE BLOCKSIZE NOW!! EMERGENCY!!!" and get their by bots, and people getting vile and toxic in demanding block size raises.
It *COMPLETELY* derailed conversation on any topic anywhere. And since those people have heavily moderated, and some who refused to stop banned, things have normalized. There is conversation on the blocksize limit here *all the time*. What there is *not*, is constant spam for alternative clients to try and sybil attack the network and force a hardfork. They are two different things, and acting like you "can't say certain words here" is ridiculous.
I was literally banned from for 2.5 weeks because of an insult **in response to the exact same insult hurled at me** and absolutely no ban was put it place for the other party. There is no censorship here, there is moderation of disruptive and spammy behavior(people know Bitcoin Classic exists, if they want to run it, they will. Spamming with BitcoinClassic is just **spam** and in no way a constructive debate) that derails constructive conversation.

No, Im pointing out the logical fallacy in what you said. You said either people are picking on Coinbase, or are not picking on Blockstream enough (which is a laughable statement on its own). First off, you present two alternatives as the only possibilities, and second off, tjey both boil down to saying: Blockstream is being shady. You are deceptively creating the illusion of considering two alternativea, when in reality all you are doing is stating one thing as a certainty in two different ways. 
So again, got any more bullshit up your sleeve?

Go drop by the Bitcoin Core slack one day and ask if anyone has any logs of him screaming "Anon-fag!!!!" at anyone who uses a pseudonym. Or screaming about how we need to push all the darknet use off to Dash or Monero, or the gubberment gonna get us. Aquentston is fucking mentally balanced. Not just passionate. Not just short-tempered online. He is certifiable.

6) Incentive
  By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended. 
   The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. **Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.**

No, see ethically, there **IS** a right and wrong answer. This is a *private* forum that theymos started. It is open to the public **because he opens it to the public**. It is **HIS**. As long as he is not violating site wide reddit rules, this is **his property** and he can do with it whatever the hell he wants. 
The fact that **A BITCOIN EXCHANGE CEO** is lobbying to **INTERFERE IN AN INTERNET FORUMS OPERATIONS** to benefit his opinion on "scaling" is **INSANE**. Do you care about anything at all besides getting rich? Are there any ethics or morals rattling around in your head?

Not likely? Cause it looks like there doing it. Now. The question is are they dumping so much value into BitCoin to use that as a replacement or not.

*People have talked about changing the PoW for YEARS*. If you are trying to paint this as solely reactionary to this, you are nuts. This is a topic of conversation that has been going on since ASICs were invented. 
You people(and I hope this comes across as offensive, because I mean to offend you) are off your fucking rocker. **ANYTHING** at all that Core developers do is "toxic, reckless, etc." whatever other bullshit buzzwords you can come up with to portray them in a negative light. **They are the most careful, conservative, and patient group of developers out there.** 
**Writing a patch does not equal central planning. There is no central planning. No matter what code they write they CANNOT FORCE ANYONE TO RUN IT.** How dense can you be?

Correction, 12 million, equalling 12 trillion in value.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:41:03
That may be, but at the just lost 1,000$ value of bitcoin with 14.5 million in circulation, that's 14 trillion dollars of bitcoins.
EDIT: grammatical errors.

I'm sorry, I didn't think the internet would be too complicated for you. I just threw out a starting point from a Google search for you to begin with. I'm sorry I assumed you were intelligent enough to verify and research a topic yourself, instead of making a call as to it being credible or not based on one source someone shows you. 
I did some more leg work for you, but that's just because you seem to have trouble understanding how Google works.

We are half way to the cap of 21 million coins, before we reach that we will likely see variable values for individual coins, or blacklisted coins, that can only deflate the overall value average of coins as a whole. This will be because physical goods and assets to back that value without exchanging to fiat currency will be contested, coins will stolen, or people will blackmark people as trade partners. China has become a third of exchange traffic and more than tripled the value of bitcoin compared to fiat currency in the process. That gives them sometime in the near future a currency to store value that will become more valuable as long as Chinese coins aren't undervalued or black marked. That is if played correctly something that will constantly deflate in value, and as long as China is not undervalued or blackmarked will see them holding a constantly increasing percentage of the total pie.
As well, a reminder that dismissive condescension first came from you sir.

If they drop the dollar as a reserve currency and use Bitcoin in its place, isn't it very possible that many countries could make similar moves in a domino effect?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:28:37
No, it shows them dropping the dollar, and Bitcoin just boomed based on Chinas jump into the fray. If you actually read my post, the Bitcoin replacing the dollar was the what if, the possibility. The articles I'm linking are showing their distancing from the dollar. Are you always such a condescending asshole? Or do you refuse to put two and two together yourself on some basic principle?
