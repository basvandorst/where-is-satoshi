I am not the creator of the video you moron and Andreas' opinion means less to me than a fart in the wind.

Andreas is nothing but a paid blockstream shill.

Corporations are obviously already making profits just fine, Bitcoin does not need a central bank issuing fiat 'Bitcoin IOUs' for us and that is what this video is pointing out to you unless you missed it. 
Also I don't believe it will replace the world monetary system (although it might) but rather work alongside it.

No you are the absolute moron. I'm not a shill I'm just here to help those who want to help themselves, if you want to live in your little bubble until it pops so be it - I don't give a fuck about you, suffer the consequences.
All those who aren't indoctrinated by blockstream's propaganda machine though should be given a chance before they throw their hard earned money into the wind.

It is the real bitcoin, without a doubt and it isn't just a blocksize increase. It's actually decentralized because development is not dictated by a banking group as Bcore is (bilderberg group aka blockstream).
BCH reintroduced zero-conf transactions, will re-enable Opcodes which will allow an ETH-like ecosystem on top of the BCH blockchain and BCH so far has also improved the difficulty adjustment mechanism (and plans further enhancements soon). 
In January BCH will be updating addressing so as not to conflict with BTC and BCH has also set a path for regular hardforks for upgrading the blockchain every 6 months. 
BCH is quite literally what BTC was supposed to be before Blockstream arrived, this is why it is worth $25 billion dollars months after the fork and why money continues to flow into BCH.
Now you can see why Blockstream/Core/Bilderberg are so frightened of BCH; they can't stop it and it destroys their business plans.

"Buying", no it would be investing still, either appreciating or depreciating in value. You're correct that investors don't get to dictate and control everything but if you are a majority shareholder you tend to wield exceptional control over a business and that is what Blockstream is.
You are a fucking idiot.

Obviously I am not a paid shill, nor a shill at all - the bilderberg group is not financing unlike @_date: 2017-12-06 03:26:04
What conspiracy? Do you actually know what that word means?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:22:05
Do you think they're investing in Blockstream because they like throwing money into the wind? Do you even think for yourself at a given point in a day?
