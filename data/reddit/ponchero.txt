"The sheer excitement lead to a big turn off by my brothers in arms" What does this mean? And are you speaking for all the Chinese panelist? But does that assume that China (cause were not talking about Eastern culture in this conversation were talking China) understand "the West"?
They know what to expect because the English bitcoin media and community sentiment is global and translated into almost all languages thats not the case for the Chinese community. So they know what to expect, thats not the case for people who visit China. Get some translators, get your messaging on point beforehand, hire some foreign staff and accept that most people do not understand Chinese culture so do a better job also of explaining your culture and expressing yourselves. To their credit some of them are starting to do this. And for the other side listening does go a long way, hes got a point there. Dont just wait to talk.

Wasnt he gonna release some bitcoin news months ago?
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:40:16
It is very good for bitcoin to be publicised in a critically acclaimed movie that is being heavily pushed on social media by star musicians to their millions of followers. A huge whole new audience will get exposure to digital currency. Its a watershed moment in my view, getting into btc 2 years ago, the progress is mind blowing
@_date: 2015-12-08 16:39:40
Agreed the massive language and cultural gap an incredible hurdle to overcome. There are simply not very foreigners in China period. Add on top of that, that few  foreigners in China understand Bitcoin. Few Understand Chinese language. And few Have the communication skills to facilitate the progress needed on these important issues. Then in the west, Not enough people understand bitcoin, Very few understand China and Have the communication skills to facilitate the progress needed  on these important issues.
There are bridges starting to be built and events like Scaling are going to go a long way towards starting to make communication more frequent. I would also add this. I just hope the Chinese side begins to realize as well they gotta start putting more effort on clarifying their positions. Not just saying talk to us on wechat...Get some translators, get your messaging on point, hire some foreign staff and accept that most people do not understand Chinese culture so do a better job also of explaining your culture and expressing yourselves. To their credit some of them are starting to do this.

Theres also a very advanced mobile payments systems, where u can send Yuan to each other using messaging apps as well as Alipay. Fees are also lower when doing ecommerce. BTC has stiff challenges here in the realm of merchant adoption

Misleading title. He clearly states he believes BTC is the main coin. And like any new person to Crypto is seeing the scammy promises of paycoin as a great opportunity. People have given him good advice to stay away from paycoin. Hope he takes it

Yea, the positive piece by RT on Bitcoin is surprising. Good conversation, kinda reminds of when CCTV in China did a informative piece on BTC

Typical Chinese business tactics. That "Star" Xu is such a dick. From his claiming of being the "China King of Bitcoin" to his stupid comments at the HK conference in 2014. The signs were always there. Im not suprised that so much international staff left okcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:01:50
Okcoin at this point is not only embarassing themselves, but all Chinese bitcoin companies. I would even go as far to say reinforcing the perception that Chinese companies in general are not to be trusted. This is extremely unfortunate and I hope to see more Chinese voices standing up and calling this out. We need to hear from the Chinese bitcoin community on this. Oath to "god"...Childish and awkward. This is why you need an international staff in a global company from China.
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:58:39
And the forging too right? Thats a "cultural difference" too?
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:14:42
Understood about the language barrier which is very difficult indeed. And I wish there was more of a bridge between the 2 communities, given this I hope we will see somebody or some type of message from the community in China. Because I believe this issue will have ramifications for the honest Chinese bitcoin companies here. Chinese companies have to work infinitely much harder to gain the trust of international customers and fair or not instances like this paint all the companies as untrustworthy. As for Chinese being respected on r/bitcoin, I don't see why they wouldn't be
I do believe Xu (not referring to him by "Star" that ridiculous fake name anymore) does represent China in a way, on the international stage as the CEO of a global company, not all of China of course. The majority of Chinese "leaders" have this arrogant and crass attitude with no regard or consideration for professionalism. Which I attribute to a combination of the education system, hierarchical business culture, the fact the China closed its doors to the world for so long, combined with the rapid accumulation of wealth. This attitude is especially prevalent when it comes to contract issues when they think they got the bad deal or they just change their mind, and this would be exacerbated when said deal is with a foreigner. [On top of that the completely warped interpretations of contracts here, which are not in line with international standards at all]( 
As somebody who has lived in China for many years and respect the culture and people deeply I sincerely hope there will be some change from within when it comes to these issues. Cause these attitudes and tactics aint gonna fly outside of China

@_date: 2015-05-23 16:54:45
This unfortunately is a common ocurrence when dealing with Chinese business people. They do not respect contracts and always try scummy tactics to get out of agreements. Seriously, having a "lawyer" just start speaking Chinese in the conversation? This not only reflects poorly on okcoin but reinforces the perception that all Chinese companies cannot be trusted. They have no one but themselves to blame. "Star" Xu is a typical Chinese "leader", arrogant and crass, without regard or consideration for being a professional. Good on you Roger for exposing this scum bag, I know exactly the feeling of these fools trying to cheat and lie on agreements.

Something along the lines of foreigners can never understand China simply because they are foreigners. Dont remember exactly the words but the way he expressed it came across as arrogant and crass (which I dont limit to him, as in China this attitude is common in "leaders") and the audience laughed at him while he had a surprised look on his face. His demeanor was just off putting.

Heres some suggestions &amp; warning to others:
A. Clearly warn people that if you put btc in the wallet now you wont be able to send it out of the app! (Seriously, what the hell is that about???)
B. Add a help section about how to use the wallet
C. Add Pop up notification when you receive btc
D. Add a wallet you can actually use to send and spend btc outside the app
E. You guys advertised that if you invite someone to the app you get gems. False, I got no gems for getting my friend to use it!
This is basic stuff guys, C'mon!

There is no mining centralization, get cheap electricity and cheap hardware and you can be a mining power too. While your at it tell everyone else to buy BTC as well. Keep in mind China is the country that has invested the most in securing the Bitcoin network in terms of volume and mining to date.

Counterpoint: The Blockstream team didnt come out very well in the event. At one point referring to Segwit as a "Bandaid solution". BTCC's representative rationalization of higher fees was quite shaky. 
The reason Roger was invited is that he is an influential person in Bitcoin and a vocal supporter of another scaling proposal.

You fuck off. The queen? She could have ordered muders from the comfort of her palace for all u know. A monarch whos family is responsible for the deaths and enslavement of hundreds of millions probably billions. Not to mention the fact the idiocy that monarchs still exist. Shes a queen size bitch that deserves to be put on the street just like every other monarch on the planet
