Its very cool.. but people here keep putting on the level of a lamborghini or something..  I love it and think its great because people think its worth so much.. makes it even more fun. I bought a 16 cadillac ats instead of a 2012 one and don't regret it always but today I do!

agreed - too many posters have their net worth tied up in the rise of bitcoin for the subreddit to do anything but pump it up.. anything that disagrees or threatens this is downvoted and sent to oblivion

Ehh because the maker nerd piled away enough to tank it to 0 at any time.
let the down votes come but it is true, satoshi or whatever the spelling is owns so many he is the market.

who cares.. everything is haram to them. fck em
@_date: 2018-10-20 11:54:39
Exactly. knowing the maker has enough to tank the market to nothing at any moment isn't "security or stability"

Can you explain that for the non-coder person? (me) whom is interested in bitcoins. I was curious if he mis-typed if it would be gone for good.

Yep.. every step is anxiety ridden.. and if something goes wrong you really have no one to hold accountable.. bitcoins and the like are very risky... but some have made millions.. I guess the greater the risk sometimes the greater the reward.. I was too scared to invest anything heavy.

@_date: 2019-02-04 18:40:01
No.. it sounds like he got scammed - sent the coins to the scammer and now is hoping the company can reverse it.. which may or may not be possible. If they have the coins it still is a HUGE thing for them to resend them back to you without permission.. even if you were scammed.. they'd be taking someone elses coins.
its quite the situation to be in, wishing you luck

GOOD IDEA. My brother got my dad into it and I know he has lost substantial amount due to being talked into it.
@_date: 2018-11-09 14:36:48
but still they have that power.. we saw before that huge buy order then part of it cancelled to manipulate the market.. shows there are single people who can change the whole market... not very safe in my opinion. but I had this opinion before it jumped and could of made money, so I guess I am a safe investor

It is actually a % fee - not a 30 cent charge and %. It usually is around 1% for everything except american express (2.5%)
they do not charge a % and a fee both.
@_date: 2018-11-09 13:19:07
do it again.. now.. until your gold is securely delivered, minus a fee for the security and delivery

@_date: 2018-11-28 18:45:40
Who are you to tell him how bitcoin is to be used?  For all you know satoshi made it to hold wealth and nothing more... just because its good for transactions doesn't mean people who investing in it aren't "using it right"

Uh yes gold had nass adoption from the beginning of civilization and its why the dollar was based on it... and why its value is so stable.

terrible outlook - cut your losses and move on.
that's like saying I lost my arm to an infection why bother worrying about medicine? then you lose your other arm and leg.
sell and at least you only lost 70%. It could be worse - 30% worse to be exact
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:00:38
for something that began at 1 cent that means nothing really
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:17:06
So I suppose you still think long-term is going to be good still I assume? I guess any holders are super optimistic type of people...
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:49:25
because they made a mistake not selling the first time and now is better than waiting and making another mistake watching it get worth less and less
@_date: 2018-11-09 15:17:05
Good way to look at it as well...  is your username a half life reference?
@_date: 2019-01-31 22:09:20
Everyone that doesn't hold their own coins learns sooner or later... you think when mt.gox happened and like 60% of coin holders learned they'd of kept the lesson in their head... 
but I suppose some trade large and thus need large amounts on the exchanges.. sucks terribly for them
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:45:20
if your holding it hostage and he can't sell it if he wanted to then his losses are your fault.
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:23:33
I'd consider withdrawing then fighting.. just so you at least have your money

Even if you witness massive drop and market crash by 2k+ you'll just ignore it and keep holding??....
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:44:33

They hack a verified account. They don't change the username as that will get rid of the verified tick.
Edit:  many people are confused as to how Twitter usernames/profile names work  - which is understandable as it is quite different to many other  systems.
Both the username and profile name are changeable. The username in the picture shown in OP is shown to be ** on the right. This is the one where if you change it, the verified tick will be removed.
If  you change the profile name however, the tick remains the same as your  username hasn't changed. In this case the hacked/bought account was ** and the scammers kept this username and changed the Profile Name to **Dọnald J. Trump** and changed the image to Donald Trump's image. Changing these do not affect Verified status.
The  reason of the dot underneath the o, is probably to prevent it  automatically getting recognised as a fake/spam account by Twitter as  even this small change can make a big difference as the ọ is a part of a  non Western alphabet.
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:11:29
Wrong. Your an idiot.
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:17:09
i've looked into it.. sadly once you hook the cold storage usb into a wallet then the whole watch is no longer able to be used for cold storage without a $895 QR code changing on the watch and you re-creating your own usb with the cold storage code..
so its like a one time use cold-storage wallet.
beautiful watch though.. if I was into bitcoin id of bought one over my rolex daydate.. the carbon one is beautiful.  downside is their resell value won't hold like a rolex.
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:55:29
yeah kinda not good seeing a lie came before the truth.

99% chance the hackers are based in North Korea.. they are behind 80% of bitcoin hacks and usually any large sophisticated ones are them.. a group run by the regime to get funds..
$40mil prob has kim dancing.
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:14:19
don't use them.. they recently held someones $4.5 mil hostage
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:38:45
and then buying bitcoin..
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:04:05
They just assume it frauds due to the amount.. no proof to say its fraudulent.

its 4.5 million USD..   are you crazy?
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:04:07
Not true.
Still exists. They are the ones behind the hack of Sony due to the movie showing Kim executed (The Interview)
Defectors up to 2017 were interviewed as working there.. it is running 100%.
"South Korea has also repeatedly blamed Bureau 121 for conducting GPS jamming aimed at South Korea. The most recent case of jamming occurred on 1 April 2016. "
They've been proven hacking as recent as 2018 but the wiki shows in 16 activity was linked to them, you can google for further hacks done by them. They hacked the bangledeshi central bank for $80 million.

He just wants a nuke program so he can't be told what to do and his family remains in power.. but they do have political camps with generations of families locked up for asinine reasons. They do hack any Country for monetary gains to achieve these goals. I make my own decisions my Country doesn't decide for me. They are hacking as evidence has clearly proven.

Not smart to ever keep that much on a market.. but you've probably made tens of millions by now, hopefully.. especially if you keep 4.5 mil worth on a exchange.
Good luck. I think what they are doing is wrong and won't use them anymore.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:57:38
just do small amounts.. don't keep $ on the exchange
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:39:47

Do NOT USE this company if they stole his 4.5 mil they'll steal yours sooner or later

I would not.. probably a scam.

don't bet what you can't lose.. pathetic
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:04:46

Good luck. Let me know what happens.
