I would say it's definitely better to control your own coins/wallet during this. It could go a number of ways...

That's really weird. I am a CoinBase customer (not GDAX).
Email was sent from 
Coinbase &lt;no-reply=coinbase.com on behalf of; Coinbase &lt;no-reply
Subject: Update for customers with bitcoin stored on Coinbase
Please update here if you get the email later in another batch. Would be VERY strange if they send it only to some customers.

Check spam? Email went out today at 12:30pm EST it seems.

Hi, I posted a crowdsourced list of options here
Consensus seems to be that people like
Here is the full post, hope this helps:
To get this thread started, here is my initial list with comments from experience. I will update this list based on your experience and feedback, trying to present a fair average view of each option.
**PRO:** Good user interface and easy purchases. Instant buy options with certain debit cards. Initially starts at $500 USD instant buy limit, after 30 days it goes up to $2000 USD.
**CON:** Slow, lots of downtime recently,  only offers 3 coins. Not sure if it's a Coinbase issue or bank issue, but there may be unsuccessful deposits even if debit card is verified and used previously. There have been other users/reddit posts about this.
**PRO:** Fast trades, offers coins some other exchanges don't.
**CON:** Unavailable balances (e.g. right now STORJ), can be expensive, very bad customer service (unanswered tickets). Lots of community distrust.
**PRO:** One-stop solution to buy a researched and diversified crypto portfolio without several exchanges and wallet. Also low fees from what I've heard plus excellent interface.
**CON:** In closed beta right now and will launch by invitation only to ensure service quality. (Saw the platform at an event a few weeks ago and would really love to get in.)
**PRO:** Fast trades, offers coins some other exchanges don't. Customer service replies but it takes quite some time.
**CON:** Some downtime recently and login issues reported. 
**PRO:** Professional setup for trading, pretty easy to use.
**CON:** Verification can take long, owned by CoinBase (dealbreaker for some).
**PRO:**  Pretty good community rep (some complaints), interface works well.
**CON:** I read about withdrawal issues, which makes me nervous. Also, support totally overloaded, it can take weeks or months to get help, that sucks.
**PRO:** Leveraged trading options (I wouldn't recommend touching that, but there you go). Good volume.
**CON:** Customer support not great at times, had at least one hack I've heard of where they socialized the losses to all users, boo. Fees are mediocre.
**PRO:** Ability to purchase crypto before full completion of bank deposit/wire. Once Gemini gets enough information on the desposit/wire you can buy cryptocoin but there's just a temporary hold on that amount for withdraw. This really helps if you're trying to buy the coin quick.
**CON:** Only has BTC &amp; ETH. Only USD deposits. Some comments below say that accounts have been locked and funds are locked, not good if true.
*Over to you: What platforms do you recommend or dislike and why? Please share and I'll add them above as a resource for all of us.*
