If you're smarter than the guys at MIT, I'm a monkey's uncle:  - according to the billion prices they track, stuff's costing a percent or two more per year on average (closer to just one percent).
Wikipedia definitions of hyperinflation. Let's see which apply to USD (or any major world currency):
* The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power
Well, that's not true.
* The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;
Well, that's not true.
* Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;
Well, that's not true.
* Interest rates, wages, and prices are linked to a price index; and
Well, that's not true.
* The cumulative inflation rate over three years approaches, or exceeds, 100%.
Also not true.
Got any other definitions we could use? Or how about a list of goods that have doubled in price since 2000? Please emphasize things that we use regularly, essentially and in great volume (i.e. gold is not a great example).

I would love to see BTC get stable enough for me to feel comfortable leaving at least working currency, if not some additional funds, in BTC form. Right now, if I left for a week and got back, I wouldn't know what to expect - will it be able to buy me 20% less stuff/rent/whatever than before, or 100% more? And that's just not good from a currency. My worry is that the people now rapidly adopting it are not looking to build it as a currency, but simply hoping it will go up in value. Personally, I want it to stop going *up or down* significantly so the speculators get bored and leave :)

This is not a good thing if Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency instead of a speculative way to get rich quick.

No idea what you're talking about. Can you clarify? I'm guessing you mean that Bitcoins are a shallower and less liquid market, which, yes, explains the volatility in part. But ... what's your point?


Well, gold lost purchasing power for a few decades before spiking back up in the 2000s ... so if you held gold over the so-called riskless asset (T-Bills) you'd have experienced a long drawn-out drop in purchasing power - also true vs. simply owning short-term bonds, CDs or savings accounts denominated in USD (basically the most liquid ways you can hold USD would have been more stable than gold). 
And if you happened to go all-in at or around its last peak, well, 30 years is a long time to wait to recover your purchasing power. Gold has absolutely been more volatile (both up and down) in terms of real purchasing power than USD - I would love to see data indicating otherwise. Oh yes, and the same is true of oil.
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:50:34
You remind me of people talking about technology stocks in the early 2000s (technology is the future! stocks are undervalued if anything!) or housing in the mid 2000s (population growth! they aren't making any more land!). Look, I'm a fan of Bitcoin - that's why I'm here - but Jesus Christ, people, stop acting like it's absolutely a sure-fire rest-of-the-world's-currency killer.
If the point isn't moving it back into USD, then why use USD as the benchmark? If the point is that it's going to gain adoption as a currency, why celebrate its radical rise in purchasing power as if it were a roulette wheel? You want Bitcoin to 'take off'? Great, then pray for its growth to slow and its value to stabilize.

It would be useful to single out the sites that are not just dedicated to tracking, trading and reporting (i.e. to look only at sites where people are *transacting* using Bitcoins, currency-style).
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:47:39
What it means is: until you've locked your gains in by converting Bitcoins to a more stable currency, commodity, or asset you are still subject to the volatility of Bitcoins. If you think fiat money is more risky then Bitcoins, I would like to know what your definition of risk is, because it sure as shit looks risky to me if I can buy a fraction of the stuff with it one day than I could last week (see: the last time its purchasing power crashed).
To me, risk is effectively *the risk of losing purchasing power due to rapid changes in the amount of goods I can exchange my currency for*. Something that virtually overnight gains tens of thousands of percent in purchasing power can also lose that much purchasing power just as quickly. The US dollar has never gained *or lost* value even remotely that fast - it has a long and stable history.
Just think of it from a practical perspective: how useful is a currency that changes value that rapidly? I have enough to buy ten pizzas today, five tomorrow, and twenty the day after ... so I have really no idea how much pizza I can buy on a regular schedule.
But really, the OP nailed his own coffin on this one - he cites his gains in terms of USD, implicitly using that as the benchmark for the increased value of his Bitcoins.
Or, to pose it as a question: which do you think is more likely to lose 80% of its value in one day, US dollars or Bitcoins? Hint: one of them already has in its few years of existence, the other never has in hundreds of years.

Except he isn't just using it as a protocol. Per his other comments, he is regularly tapping into donations denominated in BTC. This is great when BTC is on the rise, but is terrible when it drops.
I realize this isn't going to be a popular opinion on but I think it's a little irresponsible to allow significant donations to remain entirely denominated in Bitcoins if the goal is to regularly feed hungry people.

1) You're talking about the currency of a collective of newly-formed non-nation states - kind of a poor example and not at all like a currency backed by the most powerful nation on the planet , (2) your example doesn't answer my question, regardless: what alternative currency that appeared during that time made the few who happened to hold it rich?
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:19:11
Sorry, I thought I had made that clear: I mean in the US , particularly with a USD collapse.
As for soviet-style walls ... Christ, I'll admit, it's scary, and I have no idea what the collapse of the USD would cause the government to do. We're talking about the demise of the world's reserve currency in a globalized era. To call it unprecedented would be an understatement. Supply chains broken, but that's just the beginning.
Rule of law would be called into question. Probably multiple alternate currencies would arise in the rubble. I also suspect we'd see world war, or at minimum mass starvation and civil unrest rivaling the worst parts of history. I can't see why Bitcoin would be the dominant currency, though, in the middle of this mess.
And I can't see why  (or where) people would flee - Mexico and Canada, the easiest neighbors to get to, would doubtless be in deep shit right along with us. The rest of the world too for that matter. In the midst of this mess, again: I can't see why Bitcoin would have any value whatsoever, at least over other possible alternatives.
You think the huddled masses would just sheepishly accept that those who happened to get on board with Bitcoin early are their new all-powerful masters? Why not revert to barter, or use a longer-accept and physically-durable material like gold or silver as a medium of exchange? You think these people will have, what, computers and internet? I kinda doubt it.
Anyway, I'm getting off track here ... I really have no idea, but that's kind of the point: it's not clear what's going to happen, but I think the narrative that somehow  Bitcoin is going to usurp the world's monetary system is, at minimum, self-aggrandizing and unlikely.
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:01:15
First, I completely agree with you. Second, I think the image is doubly revealing: for all the talk of Bitcoin as currency, a lot of people are treating it as a speculative investment. It shouldn't be 'exciting' in the way gambling is 'exciting' - big warning sign right there.

I'm not projecting the demise of Bitcoin (too soon to say) - I'm just pointing out that this utopia in which early-adopting geeks (I don't mean that as an insult - I *am* a geek) topple the halls of power through the rise of Bitcoin as the USD collapses is a bit far-fetched, and certainly unprecedented.

Really? The government says things are 5% more expensive than they were 5 years ago ... slow/predictable inflation. MIT, if you don't trust the government, says about 7%. If you don't trust MIT, show me *your* basket of a billion prices and how they have changed. This is as humdrum and predictable as inflation gets - nothing remotely dramatic about it. All you needed to keep up with that was a CD with 1% yield ...
And in the last few months, we while Bitcoin has risen tens of thousands of percent in purchasing power, the dollar has maybe lost a fraction of a percent ... you tell me which has more stable purchasing power?

@_date: 2013-04-02 01:46:02


No, *you're* missing the point. Where did I say it fluctuated relative to USD? I said *purchasing power* - you know, your ability to *actually trade it for stuff*. In 2000, gold was able to buy you about 1/5 as much stuff as it was in 1980. Or to use a shorter time frame: in 1982 gold was able to buy you only 1/2 as much stuff as it could buy you in 1980. Please find me a period in which the US dollar lost 1/2 of its purchasing power in 2 years. And of course, it works both ways: today, gold buys you five times as much stuff as it did 10 years ago - that's not stable either.
To repeat: if you put your cash in the simplest and most secure of instruments (government-backed, short-term treasury bills or FDIC-insured savings accounts - basically, stuff with the lowest possible interest rate and fully insured) for the past thirty years your dollar was *much more consistently* able to purchase the same goods and services than a unit of gold. If you have *any evidence at all to the contrary* feel free to present it. Otherwise, feel free to continue to delude yourself without reference to

The above does not logically stem from the below.

I hope you understand that by not using log scale that graph is entirely misleading. There is a reason that long-term value graphs (e.g. stock market) use log scale. Otherwise, they invariably start to look more and more dramatic over time as changes compound.  - if you only looked at the arithmetic scale, you'd think 'wow, stocks didn't do much for decades, then skyrocketed recently!'
Aside from that, what you really want to map out is not what a dollar does over time, but what a dollar in an FDIC-insured savings account or government-backed T Bill does over time - not to say it is a necessary truth for all time, but historically those have both been safer than physical money under the mattress (subject to theft, fire, etc...) plus it more accurately reflects what an average person would do to store money.
Here is a graph that illustrates both of my above points at the same time: (1) you'll notice that the inflation rate has actually been pretty low for a good long while now, and pretty stable too, and (2) you'll notice that simply keeping your money in a CD would pretty much preserve a stable value (i.e. that the yield on a CD roughly follows the inflation rate over time):

@_date: 2013-04-02 04:20:03
The proof is in the pudding, as they say. USD has, within a few percent either way, purchased the same amount of goods and services over the last few years quite consistently. Bitcoin has not. It has at times bought a fraction of what it could buy a few days before - at other times, it has bought tens of times what it could a few days or weeks early.
Meanwhile, the USD has weathered global recessions and depressions with remarkable stability. At its worst, it experience changes in value on the order of 10-15% over a given year. Recently, it has rarely changed more than 2-3% in a year.
Please tell me how any of this points to it being the money of "a corrupt, rapidly failing monetary-banking-payment system." Or, if you wish, explain it in terms of convexity and non-linearity.

Sure, so far, but that's like saying 'well, I take the donations to a roulette table, bet on black to either double or lose it, and so far it's doubled more than lost, so great!' Is that really responsible? I think it's more responsible to denominate in a currency more likely to be able to more consistently feed people. Just my opinion, of course.
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:38:58
Oh man ... that's rich. Yes, the USD has died. I think the cost of my groceries has gone up by a whole penny on the dollar in the last year or so. Gloom, doom, destruction! Woe is me!
You know what makes a currency useful? Stability. Until Bitcoin has that, it hasn't made it.
I have high hopes for the future of it or something like it, but no delusions that we are watching the end of the world as we know it. Good luck with your bitcoinfoil hat, though.
It's not a pissing contest, but I feel for you folks who are investing your entire savings into something this volatile. That's why I engage. But it's like trying to talk down a goldbug or fundamentalist - you're so convinced you are right you just don't care whether the data backs you up.

So those with connections to the central authority - not some private-citizen specialists  inventing their own currency on the sidelines - gained wealth. You think if some farmer at the time had said 'hey, let's
In other words, this example shows that money flows from authority - if Bitcoin were to rise in power, it would be the opposite (money being pulled from authority).
My point is that you're ignoring the interrelationship of money and power - there's no way those in power are going to let their form of money be subverted by something that would strip them of money and power. That's the example I'm looking for: the case where a group *without power* manages to gain wealth through the adoption of their alternative currency.

It troubles me because a lot of these people are clearly interested because it is rapidly growing in value - I suspect many of these fathers who can barely work FB hear that it's skyrocketing and they can get a piece of the action, not that there's a neat new kind of currency with all kinds of political and economic implications.

The latter is it losing 9 tenths of its value, exactly as I said. If it did that now, it would indeed drop back down to the $7-$14 range.


So you go from being able to pay your bills/rent for a year to being able to pay them for a month. Or you go from having enough to retire to enough to take a few years off work before working a few more decades. Sorry, but I'm not buying that you'll be unaffected if it's where you keep your savings. Unless, of course, you mean you have basically no savings, thus no skin in the game, thus this is all moot and a game as far as you're concerned because you're still making money in good ol' stable USD.

OK, you're making a lot of assumptions, and ignoring certain practical issues, but in theory, yes, I think it's possible you could travel around under the radar and transact only in Bitcoin - of course, by this I mean *you personally as an exception, not as the rule* - if that were the rule, not the exception, *you plural* would end up on the radar (i.e. if everyone does it, then governments don't get their taxes, and they get ornery, etc...).
Heck, you can already illegally wire money around, or carry 500 Euro notes, or gold, or whatever - there's no paradigm shift in what you are describing as yet. I see a mobility advantage to having it be Bitcoin vs. say, physical stashes of coin and currency, but nothing world-changing yet in this scenario.
Except, of course, that Bitcoin is incredibly unstable at the moment and has been since inception, so it does need to stabilize. I mean I personally like knowing that my toothpaste next week will cost something withing a percent or five (or ten or twenty, at least) of what it costs this week. Helps with planning my future and all of that. How are you going to plan your travels if your net worth might double or get cut in half any given week or month?
But let's generously assume Bitcoin stabilizes, and that you're fine leaving the country forever if the US makes Bitcoin illegal, and that we're talking about *you personally* and not *society as a whole* ... but see, these assumptions are starting to stack up in weird ways, and we're no longer talking about one currency usurping existing ones - we're talking about a lone adventurer living off the grid using alternative means, which, again, is nothing fundamentally new.
But if I wanted to do what you describe ... yeah, I'd still at this point use cash and/or gold to make my transactions if possible (or at least to store most of my net worth) and convert to Bitcoin only when absolutely necessary to make a remote transaction, because as of right now Bitcoin is simply too volatile - it is not a stable store of value, which is arguably one of the most important roles of a currency.
BTW, the Pirate Bay threatens one industry - a small industry in a large economy, and not one central to national security or anything that really prickles the bigwigs. It's pretty hard to extrapolate from that industry to an entire country's currency, which impacts basic government services, military, international relations, the list goes on.

Pop quiz: have your day-to-day expenses changed more in the last week (or month or year) as measured in Bitcoin or USD? If you answered 'Bitcoin' (meaning: your purchasing power in USD has been far more predictable and stable), what use is there in a graph that implies that USD is 'crashing'?
I'm a Bitcoin fan, don't get me wrong, but graphs like this are nonsensical at worst and hyperbolic at best.
Sure, there's slow and steady inflation in USD ... sure, some particular consumer products get repackaged into smaller sizes, and other anecdotes abound (though you can compare CPI to MIT's price index and see they're not cooking the books), but ... USD inflation has remained predictable and pretty stable for decades. Bitcoin has been insanely volatile over just the last year. I'm not talking volatile in terms of USD, either - I'm talking fundamental volatility in terms of *purchasing power*.
So let's not delude ourselves and say the USD is crashing - let's call a spade a spade and say Bitcoin is spiking. Whether it will crash later, who knows ...
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:46:08

Not if you have offshore accounts. That's why people have offshore accounts. Don't get me wrong - I get that Bitcoin is a level up, but it's of the same ilk. It's not earth-shatteringly different. Aside from your somewhat-unusual circumstance of crossing borders, wads of cash or gold coins have also served the function of hiding money historically, quite successfully and with more stability than Bitcoin has shown over the last year.


If it is volatile around a mean, I agree. But it's not. There is no mean. It unpredictably spikes and crashes. It's not like your 3 million net worth is bouncing between 2 and 4 (though that alone would make financial planning hard enough) - it's like your 3 million could spike up and stay at 30 million, or drop down and stay at 300,000, or 30,000.
In all of your scenarios that is the fundamental limiting factor - the lack of stability of the value of Bitcoin. Setting aside possible hacks, changes in law, and all of the other threats it faces more existentially, what will you do if your 3 million dollars worth of Bitcoin savings suddenly drops from being enough to last a lifelong retirement to enough to last you a year?
I honestly don't think you'd put your money where your mouth is if you had it. It sounds great and noble in theory, but with 3 million dollars, if you wanted safety, you might diversify away from USD into land, gold and other things, but putting it all into a currency that has been known to spike and drop by hundreds of percent in periods of weeks would be sheer folly.

I thought it was already rather useful in its slower-growth state. The current mania could well lead to (another) collapse when the frenzied speculators get scared back off, not to mention drawing attention resulting in things like DDOS attacks on one of the few exchanges out there, etc... In short: I'd like to see the growth *slow the fuck back down* for everyone's sake.

Precisely. He is creating straw men to look down on ... I don't know anyone who is down on people who have made money speculating on the value of a currency, Bitcoin or otherwise.

You've only profited once you've sold. If you 'know it isn't done yet' then I assume you're still holding most/all of your Bitcoins ... you can claim victory (lucky or otherwise) *after* you cash out to a more stable currency.

Let's see ... top of my head examples include:
1) The government outlaws bitcoins outright - this prevents on-the-level, large-scale merchants from accepting them. So now (among many other consequences) all of your supply-chain-based, low-cost providers of everyday goods are no longer an option for purchasing things.
2) The government tasks the FBI with tracking and investigating all bitcoin transactions. It does everything from inspect packages when you make Bitcoin purchases to DDOSing all sites related to bitcoin.
3) Somehow through 1 and/or 2 there are people becoming really wealthy via Bitcoin transactions. The military invades gated communities that have been built by Bitcoin entrepreneurs, charges them with anything from tax evasion to terrorism.
I never said you were 'attacking' - I'm simply saying that if the powers that be see Bitcoin as an existential threat to the existing order of things, they will take steps to curb its growth or threaten its existence. And if you think there is nothing they can do to do that ... I think you're living in a utopian fantasy world.

OH, neat, graphs. [Here, let me try one!]( In all seriousness, though, this kind of parabolic growth is not sustainable. I'm hoping things can level out so this becomes a *viable currency* and not a speculative clusterfuck.

Ummm ... if you have a problem with their data or methodology, that's great, present it. I didn't say 'trust them because they are MIT' - you uncharitably read that into my words. I just provided you with two separate and independent data sources demonstrating relatively low inflation. If you want to 'attack' them, please do it with data.
