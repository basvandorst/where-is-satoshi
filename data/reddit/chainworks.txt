Thank you for saying every problem I have with bitcoin out loud. I believe in the power of crypto but I can’t buy into bitcoin for the reasons you listed

This is what seriously scares me. Bitcoin = tulips to me unless this problem gets sorted out. I might put a bit into altcoins though

But governments treats “things” and “assets” pretty differently. 
Let’s say you write computer code for some analysis at a company, and that analysis is worth something to you and the company you work for.
Then, someone steals your computer, and your computer had the only copy of the code. (Shame on whoever doesn’t back up their code). That code might be worthless to the thief. The worst you can do is sue for damages. At most you would get the value of the computer back. 
It’s deffinitely worthless to the government. If the government takes your computer as “civil forfeiture”, the government can’t do anything with that code. It can’t be considered “seized assets.” It can be considered “evidence”, but the government won’t consider it to have value transferable to dollars, or even equivalent codes. 
Last example. Let’s say you’re in the business of writing computer programs that generate income, and you have a friend doing the same. Let’s say you both want to use each other’s codes. You could buy each other’s codes, and get taxed by the IRS for income from that transaction, or you could just trade codes, and the IRS would not tax that, because computer programs are not “taxable income”
