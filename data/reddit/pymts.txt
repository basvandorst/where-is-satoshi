I can vouch I have seen her at conferences as early as 2013, however, nothing in 2012 or earlier.

I deactivate my account every year because I give zero fucks about 'karma' and 'internet points'. However, I give lots of fucks about having too much personal information and thoughts tied to one identity. I put value on privacy over shit posting. 
edit: if you must know - when ever I see news about the upcoming summer solstice it's my reminder to start anew.

Not an endorsement, just a suggestion. 
You could use  to buy and hold funds in any currency you prefer, then when you want to spend in bitcoin you can send it from your desired currency card (USD, JYP, EUR, GBR, etc). They will handle the exchange and transfer.

This is a tough one. 
MC directly overcharged merchants and in turn said merchants passed on costs to consumers. Thus, MC's direction action caused consumers to be overcharged but they didn't do the charging.
They have a case, however, it isn't iron clad. Yet, the £40M war chest and new laws would make me rectally pass a brick if I were an executive over there.
