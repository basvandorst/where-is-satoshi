It fits the definition of gambling perfectly

Are you just going to talk about blockchain and some Japanese use it? There is nothing but speculation going on that is backed by nothing. The capital is not coming from people who think this is a great long term investment. I work in finance for my career. I do this for a living. I don’t need you to pull some shit out of your ass as to why you “just know” this is a fundamentally good investment.

This is my 3rd reddit account. Deleted my old one form when I was younger. 
Regardless, I fail to see how that has any relevance.

So you figure everyone would just pay with .00001 bitcoins to buy a pack of gum?

What possible scenario could lead to even 50k? The whole world and every country adopts bitcoin as the new currency? Totally destroying the economy with volatility in the process

Okay genius boy. How would it work then? How goods and services be priced and how would investment be encouraged with no inflation? There is only a set amount of bitcoin. 
I’m sure you are so smart that you have figured out the entire framework for the future bitcoin economy.

My god this is the most amateur trading subreddit that exists. We are all just gambling out money, accept it. 
Why are some people acting like they have a clue what wall street is doing and their means of doing it? Does anyone here actually work in finance?

Okay mr money bags. Lmao

You shouldn’t be trading if you are asking such retarded fucking questions. No one knows if it will go to 0 or go to 20k. My guess would be it’s going nowhere but down.

Crypto markets are not companies. That’s not how any of this works. Why in the flying fuck would he give half a shit about crypto? You can buy products from the non existent company of bitcoin.

It’s a straw man if you were going to talk about something else. 
So please explain why bitcoin is valuable.

That’s one of the stupidest things over ever heard. They would just add the charts. Who cares.
