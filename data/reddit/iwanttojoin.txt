Just read this thread from yesterday. I thought I'd let you know that you come off as a huge asshole.  I don't know what's going on in your personal life, obviously, but I hope you're okay.

Roger and Jihan.  But there are plenty of bad actors who are ETH maximalists like the professor from Cornell, Emin, who push for bcash to cause further division in the BTC community and push up ETH.

It's not going to split..  it's not a stock.  Its price may split in half, however, when an ETF is finally permitted.
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:34:25
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:30:45
Well, true. But miners will always sell or trade for electricity and pay expenses
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:56:16
You mean the price?  I'd say a little less than infinity if nobody sells.
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:32:18
No, it is so much cheaper to run applications on regular cloud servers.  It will always be cheaper.  However, apps like Uber, airbnb, facebook, instagram, where a service is making money off users interacting with each other, could be decentralized and it would be ultimately cheaper (e.g., fewer ads) for the user if the central application is not taking any cut.

Ok fair enough. You get to sell when you need food. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:12:28
No I think it will crash tomorrow and reverse 4:1 split a couple days later, followed by a 1:2 split in a month.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:09:02
You don't have what it takes to read a question and answer it. That's for sure.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:10:21
Huh?  Relevance to topic or Bcash?  Anyway, if Bitcoin was manipulated higher, the whole market was manipulated higher.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:22:02
Unethical scammer?  I posted once about how BCashers could pump the price of it over burning man, because a lot of holders from the bay area would be there.  Do you comprehend sentences and words?  You're a ridiculous person.  I can't believe I'm taking the time to explain words to you in this way. bye.

Eventually people will start selling because they think others will, and they want to lock in some profits and buy at a lower price.  This thought process will cause a price drop and more selling.  Eventually it will crash hard.  But just don't worry and hold.  It'll go back up.

Ether is the new media craze because of its huge gain.  I think market cap is an unfair characterization of total purchasing power of a crypto, but rather the derivative of the market cap curve and the current market cap are indicative of velocity of trading in that currency.  That said, Ethereum is on a huge hot streak.  Ether is getting tied up in ICOs (reducing supply), Koreans are going nuts for it, and press is positive relative to Bitcoin's scaling fiasco.  Ethereum will have its problems again too, but in the meantime its "market cap" may get higher than Bitcoins.  This may cause a loss in confidence for a while and a slump for bitcoin, but in the end, I think Bitcoin's technology is proven to a greater degree than Ethereum's, and Bitcoin will eventually scale.  I think a crypto-maximilist position is still a very fair position to have still.  Once the dust settles, Bitcoin will most likely be the protocol for internet value transfers and the true store of value.  
I think Ethereum will be ultimately relatively expensive to use relative to more centralized solutions but will have specialized use cases that are profitable.  It's hard though to think of DApps that truly benefit from being decentralized and that will generate profits.

Haha, no, I'm saying you come off as extremely insecure in the way you communicate with people and an unhappy person.  To infer that I was generalizing about educated people is absurd.  I don't know how you came to that conclusion.
And no, I've been on this roller coaster for a long time.

Nobody bought for that price.  That's the price that they assign bitcoin when talking about it in the news because of the 10000 BTC cost of a pizza, which was supposedly the first transaction.  People at that time who were on cryptography mailing lists were aware of Bitcoin.  Most the people mined it themselves on their CPU or were just given it by others.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:41:18
I understand the decentralization argument with full nodes.  But really, what is the reality of what the network needs?  Do we need 20,000 nodes all over the world?  Wouldn't it suffice if there were 600 bloated nodes run by interested parties? 
I ask this while agreeing that we don't really need big blocks now and maybe we won't ever.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:54:04
Indeed, however a 50%- 100% premium on the underlying asset??  There are services for adding actual BTC to your 401k that sophisticated investors would surely know about.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:46:06
There's no market open. This isn't like a stock market.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:47:17
okay I'll watch, thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:33:07
I think you're a little too emotionally invested in this, buddy. Don't let greed get the better of you.  I am not knocking ETH in the long term.
Bitcoin is where most blockchain innovations occur.  Bitcoin has political issues now, not technical, but progress is being made.  The technical solutions are ready.  I think most reasonable people would agree that ETH carries more inherent technical risk long term.

There's a current of wealth flowing into Bitcoin.  Certainly from hedge funds and money managers, and potentially from banks, insurance companies, and central banks (did Max Kaiser ever provide a source for Kremlin buying?).  They'll be dollar cost averaging for quite a long time so as not to spike the price too fast.  These downturns are caused by speculators losing faith that their short term investment might not work out.  It's not such a short-term investment for the greater wealth.

Fair point for some, but for most people a recession results in lower wages, job loss, fewer hours...  People need money to survive.
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:53:20
I'm not talking about diversifying, I'm asking whether if we had a recession like the last, would you be able to push through it without selling.  In 2009, for example, took a 20% pay cut on a starting salary at my first job out of school.  Had I had Bitcoin at that time, I may have sold some to pay rent/student loans.
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:49:04
What's there to not understand about that question?
