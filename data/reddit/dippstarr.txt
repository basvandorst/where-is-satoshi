Frankly, anybody who makes declarative statements (and believe them wholeheartedly) about Cryptocurrency valuation is 110% full of shit and does not understand it well enough to be investing.
At this stage the price is so volatile that it can barely be used as a store of value in the way that government backed currencies can. It is a commodity and its only useful value to society is sentiment around the water cooler.
If you buy Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in this current market, your odds of success and ability to predict them are not much better than throwing your money on black/red at a roulette table.

A "bubble" does not mean its a fraud like Enron, it just means that people have pegged its short term value in a range that isn't sustainable.
Crypto isn't dead, its just going through growing pains. Since Bitcoin has quite a limited supply in the long term at just 21 million coins, it should eventually be one of the highest value cryptos due to its prestige position (think Berkshire Hathaway). 
However, I believe that we will eventually settle on another crypto as the primary alternative to government backed fiat currency (for which we trade this crypto for other goods/services). I'm not sure if that currency exists today, or if it will be created in the near future. The real trick is this *primary crypto* will need to have built in mining algorithms that react to rapid price change so as to manage the creation of temporary bubbles.
**EDIT:** I work in finance so I've got a concept for what cryptocurrency means on a broad economic scale... but am too chicken to "invest" myself because I prefer more stable stores of value. I'll let you cowboys tame this wild west before I come to the party.

it lost 50% of its value in a month. The bubble of irrational enthusiasm is popping as we speak. The question is where bottom resides before it finds a more stable footing again and has daily swings of less than 5% of its value, as compared to the 20% its had in the last week.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:21:36
of course, but outside of those periods. A volatile week is acceptable if BTC prices only changed a few percentage points each day otherwise.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:06:59
Thank you very much for putting this together. It felt like it was more volatile since September, but that's also mostly because people have been making more noise about it than ever. Good to see I wasn't entirely off base in my assumption.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:48:12
is it also possible that from a denomination perspective, Bitcoin is not as clean when quoting a price because of the rapid rise in BTC to USD? For example, Joe Blow needs $2,500 worth of nose candy:
0.2242 Bitcoin
1.491 Bitcoin Cash
or 
1,754.38 Ripple
or 
13.58 Litecoin
Assuming a customer can buy or sell any currency as easy as any other, which are you likely to quote in as a seller of illicit goods?
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:34:44
that all makes sense. Has Bitcoin been in a position before 2017 (outside of spike periods) though where there are 20% intraday swings???
The very basis of something being a currency for the exchange of goods is that it has a stable enough value so as to be a trusted store of value for at least a short period of time. With Bitcoin potentially being 10% more or less valuable in as little as an hour at times, that's a tough gambit.

Great News specifically as it relates to **Bitcoin Retirement Accounts**. Even if they are legit accounts, putting everything you have into Bitcoin is quite possibly the most reckless decision of your life if things don't workout in the long run or if you lose your iron hodl balls during a dip.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:25:21
Is it possible that crypto has lost favor with the black market because of it's volatility? Depending on the transaction item, that 10% swing per day we frequently see is the difference between profit and loss.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:13:05
USD is for buying and selling shit, not for squirreling away. If crypto doesn't start acting like a currency (means of exchange primarily) at some point, it will be doomed.

quote 1: I agree, this is a feature. However, opinion of this feature is dependent on your opinion of its utility.
quote 2: Unless you have done something illegal or have outstanding debts that require you to compensate the other party, you won't be losing your ownership of **Coin 2**. By and large, the conspiracy of the world to screw people is mostly just that, a conspiracy. To the end of issuing more of **Coin 2** if it becomes more valuable, this is regulated by laws and the registration statement on the initial coin offering (on you if you get screwed by not looking at the details).
quote 3: In the financial services industry, shares of stock are not stolen from owners and it is incredibly secure because of laws and regulators surrounding it. The primary danger here is fraud, not somebody taking your coin from you.
quote 4: "Full faith and credit" in summary means that the issuer of the coin (if in the United States) cannot nullify the agreement you have by being in another state. I.E. there is no loophole to get them out of their contractual agreement to you relative to where they exist. This does not mean the coin has to be senior secured (first rights to assets), it just means that there is a legal power to your ownership in this sense.
quote 5: "Most people can purchase it" essentially means that anybody who can purchase a stock can purchase a coin/token. People who have committed fraud (or other financial crime) may be excluded legally by court order. Depending on how the industry for corporate ownership coins/tokens evolves, there may be specific categories of tokens that can only be purchased by qualified buyers due to risk or lack of genuine liquidity (that's all hypothetical).

It seems pretty clear to me that regulation of exchanges is an essential step to safer adoption of crypto currencies. There's a story every single day about somebody getting ripped off by one scheme or another, or losing access to their wallet, or whatever. At the rate that crypto is going, I can't see that as sustainable since the underpinning of confidence in any financial system is its ability to protect a person's assets. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:25:22
but do enough of the public demand a coin without counter party risk? Far as I can tell, the huge run up over the last 18 months was driven by hunger for profit, not by being decentralized. 
Every single person I've had ask me about "that bitcoin" (I work in financial services) only wanted it to make money, they didn't give two shits about the how or why of the situation. Crypto has value, its just a matter of how much, and when the public prices it according to what it is with full understanding of what it is.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:09:59
Fundamentally, you clearly value skulking in the shadows and are well beyond reality in your major concerns. Frankly, I doubt there are enough people like you to prop de-centralized crytocurrency up to the level that it would be a sustaining long term investment.

Three letter acronym, SEC.

Strictly speaking, cryptocurrencies are commodities because they have finite amounts in circulation as a raw input or store of value. I hesitate to call them "currency" yet because I can't readily trade them for a McDouble down at the Golden Arches.
Bitcoin is absolutely **NOT** a stock because it is not a shared interest in the assets/profits of a corporation. Bitcoin will never pay you a dividend, it can only ever be sold for more or less than you paid to get it. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:30:11
Stem the tide from what exactly? Facebook and Google will accept currency in whatever form it comes over the long term (if it is adopted) so long as they can convert it back to USD for financial reporting purposes. 
What they cannot accept is bamboozlers screwing over users of their platforms with crap ads. Tricking users into investing their life's savings into a Bitcoin IRA and then losing 50%+ of it over a couple months is a tragedy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:58:58
Clearly you misunderstand the concept of sentiment and how it changes on an individual personal basis based on psychological principles like sunk cost and irrational enthusiasm.
I'm watching bitcoin on Bitstamp Tradeview right now as the price craters through whales trying to build support with $1 million+ orders. 
Furthermore, in view of what you said just in this response right here, your little chart is useless. There are too many factors external to price movement itself due to an illiquid market (as compared to stock markets) with not enough volume to smooth over value volatility.
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:06:06
This kind of trend relies on a consistent driver of volume. Because of the Facebook blacklist I'm curious how that impacts the entrant of new buyers to the market.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:07:29
The biggest threat to Bitcoin is the creation of future blockchain based coins/tokens which are asset backed like stocks (see [Kevin O'Leary's Hotel crypto idea](
Let's do a comparison case, what would you invest in long term and consider a more secure store of value:
**Coin 1**
+ Decentralized low cost blockchain
+ Ownership defined by password alone
+ Non-recoverable if stolen lost
+ Intrinsic value the only reason for price
+ Anyone can purchase
**Coin 2**
+ Centralized low cost blockchain
+ Ownership defined by SEC rules and actual name
+ Recoverable if lost or stolen due to centralized system
+ Asset-backed by full faith and credit of issuer
+ Most people can purchase it
Which coin is going to be more attractive to the average investor? If history is even a modest indicator of future actions by individuals, **coin 2** should dominate down the line. This is like comparing penny stocks (those under $5 in value and of murky companies) to true company issued stocks that are on an exchange with audits to protect investors. 
The current crop of cryptocurrencies are in essence penny stocks by comparison due to the lack of important regulatory controls. Only if they are treated like a currency as a means of exchange will some survive, and only as currencies. When blockchain technology is implemented at the company investment level, the broader public will choose the more secure option based on something tangible in the long run (in my personal opinion of course).

In the current timeframe you are also ignoring a massive decrease in sentiment related to crypto due to facebook slamming the door shut on advertising to find new entrants... but hey, lets all put our rosy glasses on and ignore factors outside the scope of a short term mega bubble illustrated by trend lines.
EDIT: not to forget the significance of Chase, Bank of America, and Citi stopping customers from using cash advances on credit cards to buy bitcoin. The stable demand curve that trends would rely on are shot to shit by real problems along with the frequently declared "FUD" that exists in the blogging backpages of the internet

Bit bullish calling an 18 month period a trend when the previous 36+ months went from $900 to $200, and then back up to $500.
The last year has been a breakout, not a a reliable trend on CAGR standards.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:57:24
Great news for Cryptocurrency to move forward as a potential mainstream means of exchange. 
Terrible news for people that own crypto for speculative investment gains. Without all the advertising there'll likely be a substantial decrease in people cashing in 401(k)s and IRA's to buy crypto from unscrupulous companies advertising such products.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:23:38
blockchain is the tech, crypto is one of myriad different applications of it. To this point, crypto hasn't proved its use in the marketplace yet (which doesn't mean it can't).
If anything, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies have just shown a proof of concept for blockchain, nothing more.

He missed the mark pretty wildly on the cost of retirement plans. I don't recall the exact numbers he stated, but I recall reading somebody's rebuttle which essentially stated that he was throwing a fit over about $200 in fees (but represented as a percentage) for the first calendar year on the show's 401k plan. People don't work for free and if you want an advisor to help assist in running your plan / advising selection choice, that's the cost of doing business. It was much ado about a pretty fair starting plan expense.
At the end they set it up on their own for less, which is perfectly fine, and costs less... because nobody will be there to guide them along the way.
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:04:34
Ownership of the gears of an economy is defacto power. Ownership of a non-backed philosophy is like trying to own an idea or feeling for economic gain... it can be transferred to other objects over time, thus leaving behind the previous store of value as useless.
And as an aside, a coin backed by gold, is in essence backed by just barely more than nothing because gold is not economically useful. Yes, it costs money to mine, but there's a lot more gold out there to be mined than there is demand for it since it is not used up in industrial processes like other metals.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:30:45
I'm holding my breath on that being important. More likely, the 2,000 coin market order I saw on Bitstamp this afternoon. Blasted the price a good $700 north at least.

"Buying when its down" is only practical when it has a reason to ever go up again. Usefulness as compared to enthusiasm built on meme's and lingo is a big problem. Since it would appear that the ability of crypto to replace fiat is several years down the road, a short term loan with interest rates in the high single / low double digits is probably not wise.
Only buy what you can afford to lose... otherwise you are just gambling with money you do not have.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:46:35
That's the sound of my eyes rolling across the floor, kid.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:04:45
The primary reason bitcoin went up to near $20k per coin (for a brief part of a day) was because the media was talking about it nonstop at the end of 2017. On top of that web advertisers were bombarding people with banners about Bitcoin retirement accounts, new ICO's, etc. Then you get to the social aspect, the middle age dude at the bar with money and no hobbies talks peoples ears off about it until they slug their beer and run.
So yes, by "memes and lingo", I'm talking about irrational enthusiasm that makes crypto a gambling game, not a means for trading currency for goods/services.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:01:03
Far as I can tell, the reddit communities are using Mtgox to explain the crashes, but have entirely missed the problems of this week, which would be the SEC threatening regulation of exchanges.
Regardless of how decentralized any crypto is, if the exchanges are under SEC regulation and must report transactions, a major value proposition is dead... which is causing some to fall out of love with crypto.

anyways, I'll be happily boring people to death at cocktail parties with discussions of efficient-market hypothesis.
You clearly believe in strong-form efficiency whereas I believe that the cryptocurrency market is highly susceptible to manipulation making it weak-form or semi-strong form at very most efficient. More on that here: 
From a technical trading standpoint, its really only possible to enact such a strategy in a strong-form efficient market where the bids and asks are plentiful and in a high volume, fully liquid investment. good luck!
