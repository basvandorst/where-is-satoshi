How do you figure? I'm genuinely curious, spotting "oversold" ness would be AWESOME.

They call it a "passport" so that people can understand/accept it, but what it really is is a distributed social networking system that can do practically ANYTHING.

And this is a bad thing how? If they sell everything then you buy it up.

Because the government doesn't know its way around the Internet in spite of having invented key parts of its infrastructure, and even that was mostly created by private industry.

Who needs fashion Nazis when you have fashion Marxists?

Is there a place I can trade while I'm in the US?
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:59:33
It has plenty of both. The French Revolution consolidated power in the hands of Paris in a way that centuries of "absolute monarchy" could not, and "state's rights" never meant anything in the US, so I would say that centralization wins.

Am I right to assume that the bubbles were mainly millionaires buying into the ecosystem, and that the crashes are millionaires cashing out?
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:03:14
It's rare for people to outright lie in politics, but distortions of magnitude are commonplace, or even universal. But all leftist "cultural study" seems to originate from Marxism, so they're still right on this point.

Or you have someone digitally sign something you send to them in person.

How much did you make in profit?

Lattice based crypto probably can't be broken.

Holy shart, this is perfect. Thank you!

French democracy was a lot more centralized than french feudalism. Read Alexis de Tocqueville some time.

Panic selling would make buying them easier.

If only more people would "manipulate" the market so benevolently, I don't have any btc.
@_date: 2014-11-15 15:53:31
It stands for decentralization. Most people aren't really accustomed to that, especially in the West.
@_date: 2014-10-14 03:09:49
How long do they have before they have to start buying back btc?
@_date: 2014-09-18 06:25:47
In the BTC foundation world 250k is pretty huge
@_date: 2014-10-06 08:12:38
How's he "manipulating the market?" I don't understand.

If it's just a white nationalist conspiracy theory then what about the [Frankfurt School](

Normal people buy high and sell low, it's useless to complain about wealthy investors for having common sense.

Apparently it looks exactly like Reddit.

I always knew that Japan would be the first country where the government would step aside and let the technics take over. And by "always" I mean "Ever since I read Ghost in the Shell in 2002."
@_date: 2014-10-13 03:00:07
Well, my view on government is this: people accept government not because they're nationalists or whatever, but because they don't know who would pave the roads and pick up the trash if it weren't for the government. Because sending your kid to juvie is easier than raising him/her intelligently. And government compensates for that lack of initiative in a way that decentralized government does not, at least for now.

Especially since we have so many fucking altcoins.
@_date: 2015-09-23 00:37:48










That sounds a lot like the prelude to some kind of "universal" id chip.
@_date: 2015-11-05 21:30:45
This seems exactly like the kind of thing that should have been part of the original implementation/protocol. "How fast should the throughput be if we want to replace the international financial system? Oh I know 1 transaction per 3 seconds that should be enough."

True, money should be valued against material value and not the other way around, that's how people lose rationality in economics.
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:23:53
That's why people like government. Not because they're afraid of "rebellion," but because if they didn't have government, they'd have to pay someone else to clean their streets and educate their kids themselves, even though they'd likely get better quality and quantity for their money.
