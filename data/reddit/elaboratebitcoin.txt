Yeah man, people talk a lot of shit but do we do anything about it? 
Not enough, clearly.

What wins for me is the good support. I can't be risking the bitcoin volume I trade in just any site. This is why I'm highly recommending Paxful.

I'm so glad people are opening their eyes to the truth. If you're gonna be on P2P make sure to be in a good one. It's a pretty fragile industry, especially that it deals with money. I'm glad to be in the right side of the team. Paxful has been good thus far. (at least for now)
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:04:29
Well, it's honestly more practical.
@_date: 2018-08-09 05:35:38
Oh yeah, that would totally be a good idea for Paxful. Let's hope they integrate something like that.

To answer: [Is Bitcoin a bubble?](

I agree. I hope Paxful's KYC would be more reasonable and wouldn't affect the other users who can't fulfill those requirements. Guess we'll have to wait for that new website!

Hi, fellow beginner here. Try using Paxful. You can use giftcards \(Amazon, iTunes, Steam, etc\) to pay for Bitcoin or you can use cash deposit or Western Union. It's pretty safe as long as you trade with reputable sellers. Plus!! Sellers and even the mods are pretty cool enough to chat you about your Bitcoin questions and help you become more familiar with how it works. I've made some good friends over there. If I earn enough, I'll be selling some of my BTC soon, too. Good luck bro!

Yessss! It's nice to know lawyers are starting to support this system. Thanks for sharing your story. We should have more stories like this.
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:22:27
This is why I've switched to P2P

Sorry, but posting offers doesn't mean buying and selling of certain amounts from existing traders. As a long time trader of Paxful, I've done this way before to be a "verified vendor" so it's really nothing new.
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:03:22
But M-Pesa is also widely used on Paxful, (and probably other P2P sites I bet). They also have escrow and the idea of the "trust history" so what's the major difference that you're trying to point out here?
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:54:50
I know right, these establishments are trying to stop bitcoin in every turn, but we always find a way &gt;:)

Finally after all the articles about Africa, they're actually in there now. A friend told me they visited one of the schools they created in Rwanda? News travels fast.

lol godammit, you had me going there!
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:50:39
I agree. That sub has always been confusing af. I wish they'd make up their minds.
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:59:32
IMO, just sell it to some ETH fanatic at least you get to earn more
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:56:31
As much as you're willing to lose

i think they're two different investments. I guess it depends on what you hope to gain in investing for either. But **if you can, why not both?** 
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:21:21
don't many things generally cost more with credit cards?
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:25:49
I thought Ray and Craig had a Twitter thread about this. Sadly, I couldn't find it anymore.
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:57:48
farfetched but i wish their credit card supports crypto somehow soon (it's what i have right now).
@_date: 2018-12-21 09:51:19
COOL. I've learned a lot from Altcoin Fantasy when I was starting with crypto. highly recommend them. With the industry changing this fast, I hope they partner with more exchanges so that we can get a feel for all the different ways people are trading crypto.
