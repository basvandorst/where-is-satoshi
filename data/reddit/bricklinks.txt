it's called testing, I am sure you have heard of it, it's a way to try and predict how something will act in response to certain situations. It's something that have on this sub been replaced by emotion in the last year or so

IMHO my opinion of him has gone steadily downhill over the last year and half. 
There are a lot of great ideas that get dismissed for 'reasons' that are never made clear

Just to point out in regards to the price that there is a real lower bound to what miners are willing to sell for, that often is related to their profit margins.
So the basic cost to mine 1 btc purely in the price of electricity sets a lower limit. Supply/demand along with this metric has been the best predictor of price

The problem with this however it the 8 decimal places currently are at the limit of that can be done using the current system, computers have a hard time accurately getting very large numbers or rather the accuracy or any number.
Not until we switch from C or change computing completely (QC I'm looking at you)

From my readings of the whitepaper and all of Satoshi's writings I think it is clear btc was designed to have a large number of low fee txs being made, the volume of the many fees would pay miners (if btc still existed in the form it was designed as, and if the price went up significantly)

So we can burn through new users but never keep them, just keep getting more then turning them off to btc?
Does that not sounds like a terrible strategy to you?
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:53:09
I think was made for posts of excactly this type
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:43:46
That's a bold and ignorant thing to say I think.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:26:42
Source? I ask because as I have been heavily into btc for 4 years now and that is not the sentiment I see.
@_date: 2016-07-20 23:07:32
Times change guy, no one calls it block chain anymore. Face the facts
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:49:53
Yes, this will solve the issue I alluded to; what would be required to make it happen though?
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:59:10
let us never look to the future, let's not be prepared!
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:51:49
I suppose I didn't pick the right article, someone else who knew what I was talking about made a comment, it has to do with the 64 bit system loosing accuracy with more decimal places after 9 digits, switching to a 128 but system should solve it

If you think not changing in this changing world is a way to stay alive there is no point in conversing with you.
The reasoning is on my side, I implore you to conduct a poll or ask a random sample of people what their opinions are.
The reality is something different depending on many views, all are right and all are wrong in some way.
'static blockers' or microblockers and big blockers are all name calling tactics, avoid them or you seem childish.
I again see no sources or citations for any of your opinions. 
You have not presented anything new to consider.

I see online programs, books, [even at the community college]( level there are popping up classes and things.
But then, did The Internet ever become a study major?
All the same, good work to those who made it through these classes and their like. Congrats
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:27:39
Do you mean when we lowered the standard fee?

in 2011, none of those people *want* to continue running nodes, the ones who stopped didn't because it was too much data, they simple don't have to. Don't design an idealist system where everyone has to act optimally, that isn't reality. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:58:36
that's not technically feasible at the moment, start here 
@_date: 2016-07-15 23:19:22
I don;t think it is true, can you prove to me it is?
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:48:16
I don't know where you are getting these opinions but there is no camp 'big blocker' that has any set set of opinions. everyone judges the research based on their own understanding, knowledge, and education.
'static blockers' or micro-blockers admit they are attempting to change the premise of btc by destroying the vision of Satoshi, now that statement is just an opinion and it is exactly as relevant as your opinion, and nether have any clout in real life.
Your opinion isn't a fact.
Also, source? Citation? 
From what I have seen those you would place in a big block camp are simply trying to maintain the functionallity that the system had in year previous, in effect they are trying to keep the system from changing relative to the changing world.
If you want static blocks, that is a change (cause the world is constantly changing around it) and therefor your static-block or micro-block coin is not sound money.
Basically you are wrong based on the logic you have presented.
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:17:42
That's being intellectually dishonest I think.
Node count went down when many people that didn't want to continue hosting nodes no longer had to. Not every person is will or able to run a full node, and hamstringing the system for them would be a kin to not developing VR porn because some US ISP's don't allow their customers easy access to data.
There are many reasons node count went down and I think your letting your politics get in the way of rational analysis on why that happened
@_date: 2016-07-15 23:22:20
Well I think btc already does this in a way, but everything is 'kicking the can down the road'  and that's fine because that is how btc was designed to function. perfect is the enemy of good
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:21:13
Be prepared? Acting within the limits of technical ability and where tests say nothing bad would happen.
That's a crazy idea
@_date: 2016-07-05 13:59:53
You should contAact the EU, maybe they can do a hard fork and QE you some money
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:25:02
I don't think we should be putting all our eggs in the basket of one guy's opinion. I'd like to see more research based opinions, and frankly the research back opinions don't seem to think 1mb is a good plan and certainly cannot be the long term plan
@_date: 2016-07-15 23:34:40
wow, this is so mind blowingly against the ideas I've gotten from Satoshi, his writings, and my own long thoughts on the matter that I am forced to consider your vision of the future as one presented by the enemy.
btc is founded on change, it really really is the essence of the system. you say you want the tx data cap locked in so it can never change but that will certainly kill the system, yet the idea that you should have the idea you wanted but all the early adopters and long time users are okay to have their vision (Satoshi's bitcoin) destoryed
Simply put you see btc in the future as a settlement layer, one that is secure but not often used but maybe it has obscure value. I think that is a bad idea, I think the vision of Bitcoin as it was designed is well within the technological limits, and as I said earlier I side with the research and testing on this one, artifically limint btc so you can have something more stable is not Btc as it was designed, it's a new idea presented as the old one.
In fact, that is where btc *is* changing, you say it shouldn't changing and doubt that not changing is equal to chaning in a changing world but this logic breaks down when you look at it like this. btc is currently changing away from the use it used to have, that's  a change. Can you not see that?
@_date: 2016-07-15 15:41:19
Not that I am aware of, the guy who made the book with picture on all physical btc at the time only went to 2015 or maybe sooner, there are new ones out but I don't know of any complete categlog 
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:25:58
Source? Citation?
Change is a fundamental part of btc, it has always been that way. Not changing is just another version of change, but one that can't adapt.
