Where can I read about the benefits of running a full node?

BCH is full on claiming to be Bitcoin though. The name is different enough though imo and noobs should be doing a basic amount of research before investing their money. They need to know why there’s been a split and need to make up their minds as to which roadmap they prefer before the hand over their fiat.

The plan is keep raising the limit. Go research Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:25:51
BCH costs £0.01 to transfer £1000s. Isn’t that what BTC is supposed to be able to do? Which one is retarded?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:56:36
That’s not much of a USP. BTC is special because of its network effect. BCH is staking a claim for that network effect because BCH supporters feel that BTC has diverted from what it’s supposed to be and that BCH brings Bitcoin back onto the correct path.
Edit: you’ve edited your response so the first sentence of my reply no longer makes sense.

You might want to get 1 Bitcoin Cash as well to hedge against any upcoming market movements 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:29:27
I disagree. The scaling debate has existed for years now, way before BCH. Both camps have split into 2 coins and the market will choose which coin has the better roadmap.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:33:48
I’m no victim sir. I hold pre fork coins
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:37:07
All people that support the BCH scaling map are inherently dishonest? Ok bro

What’s so special about BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:57:14
Dude, high fees are down to a lack of space in the blocks due to a restricted block size meaning users have to compete for space in the next block creating high fees. The so called lightening network is said to resolve this but how long has it been promised for now? Perpetually seems to be “another 18 months”
If BTC had 8mb blocks right now fees *would* be lower. A lot lower.
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:40:43
Source for your first assumption?
@_date: 2018-04-28 08:55:49
That is framing it within the small confines of the crypto world which seems to be a common theme when people argue against bitcoin cash’s relevance.
The average joe doesn’t give a hoot about whether a coin is based upon lies, subversion blah blah. They just see a means of payment. If that means of payment offers them a 5% discount over using VISA/MasterCard whatevs (which is the aim), then they choose to use that means of payment completely oblivious to the crypto community’s concerns.
That to me seems to be the difference between bitcoin cash and bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is attempting to become a global means of payment whereas bitcoin isn’t.

This is fantastic publicity for Bitcoin (BCH). Keep it up chaps!
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:47:25
Bitcoin BTC can’t scale to these levels with lightning network though. Most likely going to be Bitcoin BCH that fulfils what you’re describing. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:51:31
I love Bcash!
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:34:17
It’s not my shitcoin. It’s just the shitcoin that I think will prevail in the market place.

Thanks for taking the time out to write a reasoned reply! I’d have to disagree with your last point though about the elite few. If BCH were to implement terabyte blocks which are required for global adoption there would be masses of full nodes across the world run by merchants, banks, governments, you name it. Very decentralised and audited every step of the way. Also by that time terabyte storage would be massively cheaper than it is today and the annual cost of running a full node wouldn’t be that expensive so if a bitcoin hobbyist wanted to also run a full node it wouldn’t be outside of their reach.
