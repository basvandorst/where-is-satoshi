one who didn't know there was a huge fee and tried to figure out what they could or couldn't send with the available funds on coinbase.

and this is why bitcoin is doomed to fail
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:06:16
yeah and i dont have a second idea. im literally going to have to drive down to the dmv and get a state id (in addition to my license) just to sign up. because gdax requires two picture ids, and passports aren't one of them.

7 days.

family? *looks at family* i have no family.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:54:19
brother, i've been saying this since day one. centralizing and regulating keeps things in check. 
bitcoin was doomed from the start. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:07:08
not completely, because it still falls on coinbase on what to charge. if the fees arent as high on other platforms, then yes, it is a coinbase problem to an extent.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:47:32
this will not end well.
everybody is losing their minds right now.
beware the massive correction coming
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:20:02
till you realize coinbase is charging $14 to send $2 worth of bitcoin to another address

even though you're talking about wrenches, my $500 predator gen has been running fine for years.
shit talkers get fucked.  it's like the people naysaying about our bitcoins. stupid knows no bounds. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:38:32
what makes this hilarious is that a lot of major brands are produced in china. 
case in point: honda. also made in mexico and other places. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:40:45
Thanks Ob...itcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:44:00
Nice troll account.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:23:30
coinbase is no longer accepting calls.
good job guys.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:47:15
Buy all of it
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:41:55
this is also a very good possibility. i can't wait to see what happens tomorrow night after the big bang episode. 
the entire world is watching bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:07:14
It was a joke. A bad joke.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:30:51
most people aren't going to wait 5+ years for their banks to accept bitcoin in order to pay off their mortgages.
remember, a BANK controls your mortgage, not coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:38:32
i could care less, i just did this for the lulz. i havent lost anything...just wanted to work some  meme magic. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:01:30
And I wouldn't say it could easily crash as much as it could go up. It holds more value now than it did and everybody knows it has a possibility to go much further. When market analysts are expecting a crash then I'd worry. If JP Morgan can't scare investors away I don't think much can at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:58:39
Back in 2010 I could have dropped $90,000 on it. I lost it through other means. I'm not going to throw a pit party over it though. I have to move on and keep looking forward. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:06:11
Nowhere near as much as they should. Almost every time I see a milestone hit or major news for Bitcoin or crypto it's crickets on their channels and sites. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:27:43
i edited the post. but to clarify because bitcoin isn't going to pay off your house or buy some land. most of the big boys hodling bitcoin will exit out to pay for these things.
this is a clear pump. sure it's some normie investors but this is a pump/bubble. i expect (not that i want to see it happen) a 1-4k drop when it's all said and done. pretty much what happened last year when it cleared 1k then went back down to a few hundred.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:06:54
Thanks for the source, reading now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:29:14
it's greed mixed with a fever pitch right now. the publicity is good now but wait till the dip. then it's all "volatility this and that" and "i told ya so"
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:27:09
5 years? 
Try 18 months
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:10:23
You think this is it? Wait till that Big Bang Theory episode hits. 
Just. Fucking. Wait.
There's a reason you won't see major networks cover it on their business sister channels. They're backed by companies that have interests against crypto. I'm actually flabbergasted they'd mention it on the show. It's like the cancer cure equivalent to money.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:09:57
Bitcoin and too late don't belong in the same sentence. That's what a lot of you folks can't seem to wrap your heads around.
A recent poll was done as to when Bitcoin holders would probably consider completely cashing out. You know what number they settled on?
$196,000. As in how much they expected each Bitcoin to be worth.
If the majority of holders are banking on it hitting that amount before considering liquidation...that means they at least think that's the figure it will reach. That leaves room for it to still be much higher, for a lot of different reasons I shouldn't have to explain.
If you think it's too late to invest in Bitcoin you really don't understand it. There's a very big reason the CEO of JP Morgan said it's a scam. They're fucking terrified of people making wealth without using their draconic systems that only benefit the very tippy top. A guy who makes a few hundred grand on Wall Street put a thousand percent more into the pockets of people he doesn't even know, just by showing up to work.
Bitcoin changes that. Money literally runs everything and yet we're all pretty much a slave to it. Cryptocurrency, most notably Bitcoin is custers last stand to getting the common folk (nerds, like me) out of it's clutches.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:29:38
He's lying.
Edit: this a joke.

Awww poor bb
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:53:45
Just because you don't watch other people fuck each other in intense gangbang orgies doesn't mean it's not important.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:34:05
Because you're worried about what you could have had instead of what you can have.
That thought process is toxic and will destroy you.
I had...key word HAD a lot of money I could have invested in it as well as a lot of other people. You aren't the only one who feels like they missed out. 
It will go much..much...much higher. Don't be kicking yourself twenty years down the road.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:58:34
are you talking about the chinese guy who offered a house for btc? that didn't work so well. 
[edit] also: taxes. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:53:28
but this implies you'll be able to buy a house with cryptocurrency. when major financial institutions literally control every aspect of buying or selling a house, it's hard to believe an investor will hodl to purchase a home. most land holders are not accepting crypto either. i find it hard to believe there will be such a massive shift within 5-10 years in those markets, even if the value of bitcoin rises. for bitcoin to truly surpass the dollar it needs to be valued around $1,000,000.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:21:06
this. everyone is going crazy right now and we're going to see a massive exit soon. this is not sustainable. it's only going up because of the hype train and people still value their fiat because...
you can't buy a house or pay off your car or take a vacation or buy a lot of thing with bitcoin.
in a perfect world, everyone one would hodl and crash the fiat markets, but it's not going to happen because idealism isn't going to pay your bills or make you financially independent at this current second.
if i had some of the money these hodlers have, i'd have already cashed out and bought some land, a house, and whatever i needed to survive for the rest of my life...and it would have had to have been paid in hard cold cash.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:14:27
dang that was good read.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:22:16
if it hits 20k today it will go through the floor. fiat pays the bills, bitcoin does not. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:30:30
Speculation now. Will be reality at some point obviously.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:54:07
My calves turned out god tier. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:34:54
it's funny because at the end of the day, most investors aren't hodling because they have some idea of btc being the accepted curency, they're waiting on the right time to cash out. that is the Achilles heel of btc. there's always going to be that moment when a whale makes a wave and drowns everybody else
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:08:21
God this is the singular most important thing I explain to people. 
You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin.
