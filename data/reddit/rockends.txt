Edit: To clarify I was just looking for evidence of a raid to make sure giving is not some sick scam.

Thanks Nyr7

Just to clarify, yes I did mean proof that he was raided.

Still negative balance on my card.

It's all about your power cost...

After some of the crazy posts he made, drunk, giving up, no info and is still slow in refunding people BTC I'd have little faith in this person running a business at this point.

I wish you success!

He just edited this post
From TOM:
I know - no one is happy about this
and I have a confession to make.
I have been dumping my blood sweat and tears into making this happen
and perhaps I was in over my head
I thought I could put this together like I did with the ModMiner Quad
obviously it was not and I was in WAY over my head
I fixed the post up from last night - so at least now its has a big of legibility
yes I had a few drinks before I posted that post - I was fucking heart broken, some of you look at my like im fucking scammer
and it couldent farsest from the truth. Look at what ive done for Bitcoin over the last 3 years, I live and breath bitcoin and I love it.
Unfortunately this project was way over my head and I thought I can handle this the same way I handled-ed the ModMiner Quad project, obviously I was sorely wrong and I am so sorry I could not bring this project to market in a timely manner
But I swear to you and I give you my word I never meant to lie to you or tried to give anyone bad advice. I am sorry about my drunken (now fixed ) post from last night - I had a few drinks before that post because after receiving the bad news (about March) - this was the only way I knew how to deal with it. I am selling my share in BTCFPGA and it is now going to be owned by a asian company that is 100% sure of a March Delivery.  if you are not interested in doing business with this company please feel free to filll out a refund request and we will refund your money is full. There is plenty enough money to make all of these refunds and I have been a pillar of this community for years, so please no panic. Anyone that wants a refund - they will receive one today. Please I ask you to please accept my apologize - if you can wait until March you will receive a superior ASIC mining device, if you lost your trust in me and my company than I dont blame you at all. But please understand I tried the best at the best of my ability and I can't take any of this anymore. I am not the right man for this job. Your new ASIAN benefactors will be online soon to greet you all and see where were are at and hopefully they can calm some of your nerves. They have the equipment to do most of these processes in house. They dont have to relay on sub contractors and deal with all these little problems that pop up in that process. They can fab pbcs, pick parts, soldering machines, the whole nine yards. You will be much happier with this company and with my out of the picture. Expect compact from them soon.
As for me im going to back to my web hosting business and my computer repair shop and live the simple life for awhile, enjoy time with my kids and please accept my apologies for not being the person who you needed to make his happen.
I will continue to sell modminer quads on  or mining and hobbyist uses on the side, and im going to try and live a happy life, I am sorry I let you down I really am and I h ope the Asians took good care of you.

Unless of course you turned right around and spent it for something worth $19....  Or are you saying bitcoins are only for investment purposes?
@_date: 2013-02-05 22:30:55
Of course you realize the subject is BFL Board...
