Maybe. Yet you could also argue that they would have incentive to stop spamming in order to bring back more on-chain transacting. It really depends on what their motive really is at this point (though it seems obvious).

Exactly. 
Have $500 to save? May we interest you in a .001% APY savings account with fees? 
Have $20000000 to save? May we interest you in a zero fee 3% high yield account that pays you more than the average American's salary in a year?

Let's hope level heads prevail here. This could be a win-win for everyone and I hope core developers re-evaluate segwit2x based on this soon.

During a hardfork, you don't want to move coins. Your key (or mnemonic phrase) is all you need to access both if there ends up being a client compatible for each coin.
A fork does not necessarily mean 2 coins. Most forks in crypto lead to the other chain getting abandoned. There has to be intent to have 2 coins. In most cases, a fork of this nature would be considered an altcoin. You could fork off of Bitcoin yourself. Complete with a shared historical blockchain. I doubt anyone would want it though. So the only way we get "2 bitcoins" is if the users and infrastructure deem it worthy. Otherwise, you just have Bitcoin and an altcoin. 
 The entire market is based on BTC/altcoin pairs. This requires one Bitcoin and so it will remain that way. The FUD is shortsighted.

The simplest, most secure way is to store on a hardware wallet that gives you the key on the device screen. Any key that gets generated on a computer that has ever been connected to the internet is at risk.

Links MadBitcoins video instead of code. Hm... So much FUD based on falsities right now.

Prior to August 1st. If that fails (which it looks like it won't) than UASF Bip 148 proceeds. The deployment methods have been made compatible.

Bip 91 is being used here as the deployment method, along with compatibility to Bip 148. While it is not the preferred method, more core developers actually DO find it to be a workable solution, provided it is activated before August 1 (and therefore BIP148-compatible).
This update was within the last couple days and is still being considered by other developers. One does not have to agree with the NYA to be on board with this as a user/business/developer.

Yup, fee estimation is essentially driving up the fees now. Agreed, it is a major problem. It creates an unnecessarily expensive fee market.

I would spend more time discussing it with you if you weren't a dick first and foremost. If people can't derive information then they should probably not worry about issues that they can't understand. The information is cited. I am not here to enhance your information literacy.

Selling some to take profits or to allocate money to other things you care about is not a big deal. But selling all your Bitcoin entirely out of fear that is largely being propagated to take your Bitcoins from you? Yeah, I got no pity for you when you get left behind.
