Alex smith, shootout type game will happen imo. I think cowboys get out to a lead and dak lays off the gas and caps his upside

Comments like this aren't helpful at all, just my opinion. Thanks for transcribing your conversation at the bar, but it doesn't seem like you gave them much of a reason to invest other than "oh I've made a good return"

Adding to this thread because I also have a beginner level question. What happens when we reach the 21mil btc limit and no more can be mined? I'm picturing fixed demand making the price skyrocket but I can't imagine it's this simple.
