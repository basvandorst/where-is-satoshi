Agreed. Until it scales, it's not safe.
@_date: 2015-12-04 23:56:37
No, you're right. I meant safe in the terms of stability and therefore also as a store of wealth, rather than the risk of losing your coins.

Where do transaction fees go? 
I thought they go to miners who discover a block, but how does that work if you are in a pooled mining situation? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:32:41
I got one :) Works well, great watching little bits of food suddenly appear in the sink that the brush missed.  And for those of us that don't drink enough water you can get the equivalent of a glass slowly force fed to you if you keep your trap shut while it's running. 
With the leftover water you can pressure clean all the mold out of the drain cover in the sink too... Or shoot at passing loved ones over the shower curtain :)

[I didn't find that :(](
@_date: 2014-12-29 13:59:39
Interesting. I was mining with ozcoin but had to stop because it wasn't compatible with my new miner or is otherwise going rogue. So, I should in theory keep that account alive to earn my share of future mining fees? Or do they stop once I stop mining.  (They use DGM.) 
I guess related to this, how can you really ever trust a pool to not go rogue and disappear,  taking your future transaction fees with it. 
How about solo miners - highly unlikely that a small sole miner would ever discover a block. Is it only miners who discover a block that can then collect on mining fees? (A quick bit of googling seems to confirm there is no reward for solo mining unless you find a block.)  Does solo mining still help the Bitcoin network?

Recently I [compared Bitcoin with my bank, Western Union and CurrencyFair]( to see who was cheapest. That was before this new announcement. Will re-process it soon to see if it makes a difference. I have legitimately sent money from Australia to Ireland via Bitcoin and it worked well.
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:26:39
I thought they might be too, but for transferring overseas, [my tests showed]( that, for me at least, it's cheaper than Bitcoin.

I would, but the show I'm after (RTE's The Late Late show in Ireland) isn't on any torrent sites, and even with a VPN I can't stream in real time from RTE Player. I own an Irish TV license even though I'm in Australia so feel I'm entitled to watch this show. VSO Downloader can save the stream so I can watch it later.

I agree about the absolutely atrocious hdd activity on bitcoin-qt. I've had to move it to a usb hdd since it slows my laptop down so badly otherwise. Even so, after a few weeks of not opening the client, it can take several hours to catch up. Not what I would call convenient, yet the issue is continuously ignored.
It's also quite happy to flood a low speed 384kbps  ADSL outbound channel, stuffing up inbound data.
Good to know there are alternatives, will check them out :-)

Update, see edit below.
I'm just annoyed that this has caused my local Australian btc to aud conversion service, BitPiggy, to close it's doors. In my mind, a bitcoin is a bitcoin, stolen or otherwise. 
Why should we Australians have to suffer because someone didn't adequately secure their site?

I did the same as you, but also to use the heat to heat the bedroom. I don't mind If I never score a block, because it is fun anyway. Well, except for the PFN_LIST_CORRUPT error every few days and the Bitcoin client corrupting once a week. (The client is extremely unresilient when bad things happen, but fortunately you can copy the db from another pc.)

Unless you have a good GPU it's not worth it any more. My 2GHz laptop's CPU can do 900khash/sec which according to  means 3060 days, 7 hours, 7 minutes to generate one block. I'd spend more in power than I'd ever get back in coins. (Bang goes my plan to heat the house with old computers this year hehe.)

My miner runs at night to heat the bedroom, replacing a small heater. If mining were less profitable, perhaps more people would do similar rather than overdoing it with massive mining rigs. Unfortunately the desire to profit will probably exceed the desire to be green. (Excludes renewable energy miners.)
@_date: 2011-08-01 00:22:32
In this instance itis analogous to a silly banker having a smoke in the vault where the cash is, and accidentally leaving an ember. He goes home, then comes back to work the next day to find the room unusually warm, and the safe full of ash. Bitcoin is similar to cash in that regard.
Likewise smoking, and using cloud storage without a backup, are also risks that some choose to take.
@_date: 2011-08-22 08:54:01
Hmm. Unless the heat is also useful at the time of mining, BitCoin is sadly a bit of an environmental disaster.
@_date: 2011-06-06 09:23:33
 I believe they're still tied to an IP address when the transaction occurs. If the IP address can be anonymised then perhaps it is - not sure if BitCoin can work over TOR, etc.
@_date: 2011-08-21 01:23:29
I mine at night to heat the bedroom a little. It's a practical novelty, and replaces the dumb heater.

Hmmm. For a decentralised thing, Mt Gox is playing a large role. Still, given the breadth and traffic on the forum, it's probably a surprise that it wasn't hacked sooner.

The MSI boards have crap fans on them that fail early, so I set a target temp of 80 degrees in cgminer. Most of the time the fans are running at about 30-50% so their crook *sealed* bearings don't make a great racket.

Fair enough. It worked in my last relationship - not because I have any money handling issues but more just from the way we both came together from broken relationships. The home loan account received equal contributions from us both, I took care of power (since I used most of it) and would send her half the rates, etc. The rest was our own to deal with as we saw fit. We both openly agreed that this arrangement worked well. 
Side note - it's also easier for me that way since I'm self employed. Everything more or less ends up in one bank account.

I sure am. Only if you have more money than is sensible to carry. You wouldn't walk around with $10,000+ in cash in your wallet in case you lost it or it was stolen. 
If you only carry a few hundred dollars, though, then do whatever you like with it. The odds of it being stolen from your computer are quite low, but not impossible.
Bitcoin is cash. Treat it as such.

Sometimes people have to learn from their own mistakes, and cannot be told. Hopefully your partner will understand this. 
It might also be necessary (or at least a good idea) for each of you to have your own separate bank accounts so that only your half of future savings are at risk. Perhaps that's a way forward for you both. Just because you can't handle money doesn't mean you can't love eachother - and if she can accept that as a vulnerability in you then that's a positive.
Good luck.

When you need money, turn it on, leave it for a while, make sure Secunia's green, and make your payment. Perhaps use a web wallet as an intermediary (like a physical wallet with a little cash in it) for purchasing so you minimise this computer's exposure to the Internet.
Store the lot in a safe when not in use, keep the memory stick with you and another offsite.
Sure it's not 100% foolproof, but a fully up-to-date computer that isn't used on the 'net other than to make transactions should be good enough for almost everyone.

Are they actually shipping? I would expect to see more videos from people in ordinary houses mining away with them if they are. So far I've only seen a few videos online.

Of course not. Not if they don't have a significant quantity of coins. No need. The steps I suggested only apply if you plan to have a significant stash of them. Bitcoin is cash, so treat it as such.
For people with less than $1,000 worth of Bitcoins - let 'em use whatever they want, and learn from their mistakes if necessary.

[BitPiggy]( is OK when it's solvent.

You're welcome :)
And you're right. Hounds can get rowdy! But the ones I've known found cats fascinating. I don't remember them having goblin noses 'tho!
I hope you enjoy your Bitcoin adventures a little more now. Good idea to (periodically) back up your wallet file to a memory stick anyway just in case the computer dies.
At present, I don't think Multibit supports paper wallets.

I first remember seeing this in the early to mid 2000s, possibly before Bitcoin even existed. These old shockwave flash animations were the epitome of Internet animation back when we were still on Pentium IIs, before YouTube.

Thanks :-)
Just like your wallet, video your loved ones now and then. You then have a virtual backup in case the unthinkable happens.

Perhaps you can just say "I wanted to Bitcointip you, but r/Technology doesn't allow it. I don't know why."
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:51:42
ßuggered if I know.

Also, consider doing your Bitcoin stuff from a separate PC/Laptop/Netbook that is only used for Bitcoin stuff. Keep it fully up to date with security patches and a free Antivirus product. Make sure it backs up somewhere as well - perhaps with CrashPlan or something similar that supports versioning. 
Having your Bitcoins on your every-day computer is just too risky no matter what encryption methods you might use.

Might be a challenge in Australia with employer Compulsory Superannuation Contributions. Still, it can probably be done as there is usually a requisite paper trail with employment.

Dropbox emails you when you add a computer to your account, but won't say anything about web logins.

Not quite. You can still break even. But it's coming fast.

I tend to just use Google - search for company name and scam.
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:17:03
Well, throttle it down a little. cgminer allows that at least :)

Yes, to a degree. But really, the same is true for internet banking.

Blockchain.info was a bastard to use yesterday. Took 6 goes just to get to the balance page, and kept timing out during a send bitcoins operation, then returning you to a balance page of zero, with no transactions. Confidence shaken.
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:47:23
Something weird from a long time ago.
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:24:57
Same here a few hours ago.

It's borderline I think. You might not make more than you spend on power, so if you can use the waste heat then it might be worthwhile for that alone :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:26:43
Aah, but then I won't be able to 'listen to Bitcoin'.
