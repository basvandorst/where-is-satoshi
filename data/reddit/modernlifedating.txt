I meet Roger almost weekly and chat with him in Tokyo. He is certainly not a moron.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:51:53
Math doesn't check out for Roger at all lol
BTC lowest in 2012 was $5.20 - $4.50. So $300 divided by $5.20 is 57.69 BTC
57.60 BTC x $11,600 = $669,230

you can sell me your crypto, don't worry I'll take care of you big guy. It's scary out there. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:28:24
You're almost as bad at math as Roger was in that tweet.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:50:47
He is more of a salesman than anything, that and he has fuck you money so you can't really convince him to do anything.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:15:48
BTC lowest in 2012 was $3.80. So $300 divided by $3.80 is 78.94BTC
78.94BTC x $12,600 (updated price now to prove you wrong even more) = $994,644.
Sit down.

Someone needs to punch Trace in the face. Bitcoin started out worth less than 1 penny. Of course the initial percentages will be higher.

Hi thanks for replying. For the bitcore app on my computer? Yes I did. It hasn't fully synchronized yet but I read that doesn't matter online. I'm just very confused, where did the Bitcoin go if it didn't come to me? I want my Bitcoin, I paid $400 for it!

you other crypto keepers can't deny
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:04:51
It's not 100% synced. Been taking a few days now for it to do so.
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:17:39
this is my wallet right now
@_date: 2016-12-19 06:19:16
Even though I did it a few days ago?
@_date: 2016-12-18 14:27:54
It's here.
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:43:36
God, well I want to do it but I also don't want to further fuck things up. How do I do what you mentioned?
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:28:05
Ok I'll wait then.
@_date: 2016-12-18 19:48:53
Is there a chance I copy and pasted the wrong one? Maybe I left off the beginning or the end of it by 1 character? Is it possible?
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:28:19
It's in the post above 
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:31:41
I don't know how to find out which block it is 
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:51:55
1.) idk
2.) no I don't know what this is.
3.) yes I did 
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:28:28
Ok thanks brother!
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:51:20
How can I find the address it was sent to? It already changed in bitcore.
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:38:45
Nope. Now illegal.
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:19:41
don't really remember tbh, I just use conbini deposits
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:03:58
For the modern cuck. Not me.
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:35:53
really? The EXACT thing Satoshi Nakamoto was against is something you're supporting now?
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:47:45
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:45:10
The only advice you need: HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:54:01
wife wouldn't let you?
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:34:11
Thanks !
I chopped up the original one and made it a bit more spicy for my fellow bitcoiners.
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:09:57
You'll understand one day: 
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:23:47
Coinbase and Glidera are blocked in Japan
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:02:20
you should be banned for your negative attitude. People just want to have fun and it got upvoted to the front page for a reason. You're in the minority.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:33:49
I traded and lost $3000. 
I then stopped &amp; Realized the long term value of bitcoin &amp; now I HODL!
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:05:09
I know how to do that and yes I have.
My problem is my paypal debit card has $5800 on it and I can't spend it on bitflyer with my current knowledge. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:24:20
pretty quickly
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:10:14
Your username checks out, here ya go pal:

@_date: 2017-05-25 19:25:53
awesome thank you!
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:58:31
if it were anywhere but brazil I would say holloway 100%, but due to corruption, I'm 60% Holloway. It's a strategic risk.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:04:41
are you able to buy?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:43:51
