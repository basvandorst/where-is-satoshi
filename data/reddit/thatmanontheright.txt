Right on the head. The article states that what it calls "external oracle" is not decentralized at all. However, it is exactly what the users expect when he gets into such a coin and wants to vote for with their meaningfull consensus. THIS is decentralized consensus at its finest! A couple of people want a change, and they say "hey, community, do you want this as well?".
ASIC accepting behaviour is NOT decentralized consensus. ASICs flood the market and devs vote with "no-action", leaving the community the only option to choose a different coin (or fork it for themselves).
For bitcoin, i believe it is protectionism to a great extent. It cant really change anymore can it? It would do even more harm. 
ASICs are not only screwing up consensus and excluding joe and jane from showing their voice. Mining is a fundamental part in crypto economics, that if centralised to the rich/powerful etc, will hurt the function of the currency itself and irreversibly destroy the vision behind cryptocurrency. If you mine, you are the one creating the wealth (in contrast to gov. money printing). ASICs take that power and redistribute it to the manufacturer first, the rich second, the early adopters third and the poor never.
There are a ton more reasons why ASIC resistance. ASICs are the most underrated issue in cryptocurrencies in my opinion. Unfortunately only time will tell, but I know which side I choose.

Without an ICO or Premine it's probably hard to throw a couple hundred grand at an exchange.
