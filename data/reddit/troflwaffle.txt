Link to the conflicting messages? Please no secondary sources.

Do you know the differences between cryptocurrency (or virtual currency) itself, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency **exchanges**, or at least how the Chinese regulators see them?
Edit: regarding your edit, exchanges will be banned, they haven't been banned yet.  Some exchanges have already halted trading activities due to this.  The verbal order is that all exchanges are to halt trading by the end of Sept.  This is the part that is unclear, since it's been a verbal directive rather than anything officially published by the regulators.  [Source](

I won't go into the differences between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, save that simply speaking, one is ledger while the other is a virtual currency. The ledger records all transactions using that virtual currency.  Cryptocurrency **exchanges** in and of  themselves are not cryptocurrency, nor are they blockchain tech, they merely facilitate the exchange of real / physical currencies with cryptocurrencies.
This is a very, very, very, very simplistic explanation though. 
 Shouldn't most people in this sub already know the differences?

Again with this 'conflicting bullshit' claim.  Yet, when asked to point the exact 'conflicting reports' part, is unable to do so.
How hard is it to get it into one's thick skull:  China is going to halt exchanges, possibly by the end of the month.  I'm wondering at this point if it's just pure inability to comprehend literal meaning of words that is the issue here.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:23:32
Ah, so you can't actually point out where the 'conflicting reports' parts are?  Did you even read the article from the professor?
BTW, I'm so butthurt and salty about being called a 2 week old reddit troll (who probably doesn't recognise sarcasm) claiming 'conflicting reports' when there are none.

LOL, you actually think the PBOC owes you an explanation for your media hyping everything up? Why should they care about the FUD entirely created by the western press, which is based on a publication by Chinese media that isn't the official mouthpiece of the PBOC?
It's literally the western media that can't tell the difference between or intentionally obfuscates terms like 'blanket bans' and 'temporary suspensions'. Why do they care if the western media intentionally misleads its own audience? It's your freedom of choice to believe whatever you want.

Where does the professor say that exchanges won't be shutdown?  I've asked you repeatedly to point out the conflicts.  No one is disagreeing that exchanges will be halted, and in short order.  In fact, I responded to another person saying exactly that:  exchanges have received a verbal directive to halt trades, particularly fiat-crypto exchanges by the end of the month.
Again, in the simplest possible terms:  Please point out the exact wording in the article from the professor that states that exchanges won't be shut down. 
Simpler still:  Where. Is. The. Conflicting. News. Report?

Why no comment?  You were claiming conflicting reports, so surely you would be able to point out the conflicting parts in the people.com.cn article vs the caixin article?

Link to Chinese media with conflicting news?
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:51:25
Exactly this. I don't understand why people are taking this article to be a refutation that exchanges will be shut down. No where in the article does it state that they won't, just that cryptocurrencies will be regulated and it's a good thing.

From all the news and reports I've seen, China has pretty much been clear that they will stop exchange activity especially fiat-crypto activity, by the end of the month. Not much ambiguity there.
Pretty much all the confusion I've seen has been people speculating about whether the ban is real. Compound that with incorrect translation resulting in 'ban on crypto as a whole' rumours.
Since you're Chinese, you should be familiar with the modus operandi by now: stop all activity first -&gt; investigate how to regulate in line with cross border capital/fx movement / taxation principles -&gt; release guidance that can be interpreted slightly differently if needed -&gt; allow activity to resume

So no link then?

I don't even trade crypto, just laughing at how stupid people are when they claim 'conflicting news' when everything has been clear from day one.
Btw, wanna show me where there are conflicting reports? LOL
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:13:18
I don't see any conflicting news?  Both articles state that exchanges are banned for now?  In fact, Caixin literally states right at the top of article:
So where's the conflict?
E:  The Caixin source even states right at the top of the article:
Still not seeing an so-called conflicts.
