IMHO, the government should regulate the bitcoin usage as soon as possbile in Vietnam. Although there are lots of hidden risks, that is how innovation works. The adoption of bitcoin is getting more and more popular on the global scale going along with hundreds of bitcoin or altcoin startup born every month. Most importantly, it's not only about bitcoin. Bitcoin is merely on the top of the iceberg of innovation. The holy grail within bitcoin is the blockchain technology, which is the fundamental foundation that people build revolutionary applications in the future. And people should embrace it, rather than leave it behind. 
In the ordinary thinking, the reason why most governments in the world hesitate to officially allow the resident using bitcoin legally is the fear of sharing power, and the lose of its national monetary policy. If we, all of the bitcoin lover and firm believer in the blochain technology, could find a way to face such issues of the government, then the day when people altogether happily use bitcoin would be no longer be unrealistic

Thanks for the suggestion though. However, the sector has been overwritten and I couldn't do anything about it. It's not much, around 1.5 btc, though I still feel dissapointed. A lesson to learn!

[Here]( its summary version 
@_date: 2014-10-10 05:31:45
does anyone have english subtitle for this?
@_date: 2014-07-31 07:02:49
you were right, it's too late to recover the necessary file. Thank you for your help anyway!
@_date: 2014-08-06 12:32:40
 one more proof showing that government is getting scared of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:02:35
damn, you are the hero!
@_date: 2014-10-26 14:25:32
Personally, I think it seems more interesting than "The rise and rise of Bitcoin". By the way, the guy at [1:31](  look real badass!
Edited: the link :-)
@_date: 2014-09-07 08:45:15
It's only a matter of each one's perception 
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:16:32
i'm afraid it'd take a long way for rakuten to accept bitcoin payment currently
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:07:54
I love the way you're saying. Well done!
@_date: 2014-07-25 02:39:30
This makes sense. It's like when saying there's a bomb in the airplane, we face a penalty
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:55:06
Another recent [failed attempt]( from the authority party to charge against 3 vietnamese guys for "illegally making bitcoin transaction", or so called. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 08:11:18
please make sure disable all extensions that block facebook connect
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:47:38
 thanks much for the help!
@_date: 2014-12-21 04:33:49
We need a clarification here. It's the 4th searched term for "What is...." 
@_date: 2014-08-01 10:22:37
I have, but there was no such file. Perhaprs after installing Ubuntu, I installed also a bunch of things
@_date: 2014-10-10 03:50:59
whoever stating bitcoin is a scam has never read enough about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 09:01:35
Fantastic video! I believe this will be a very standard document resource for anyone making his first step into the bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:30:48
perhaps because of the sale promotion from some merchants, e.g. Dell
@_date: 2014-08-08 09:08:47
I hope that they are not
@_date: 2014-08-29 03:01:00
@_date: 2014-11-03 10:15:52
Any chance that I can contact the one responsible of translating to Vietnamese? Thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-31 07:01:47
Not much, around 1.5 btc..
@_date: 2014-07-31 06:59:20
Thanks for all of your help. I brought the drive to a local data recovery service company. Unfortunately, they said that the file was overwritten during the time that I had installed Ubuntu. 
Kinda dissapointed...next time I would use an online wallet then. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 03:56:03
Now I realize that this [video]( is too relevant :-)
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:40:55
doubt that there's "bitcoin" in the dictionary lol
@_date: 2014-08-07 05:53:49
Sorry, my bad. Thanks for the reminding. [Here]( is a rough translation for the report already provided by sonofliberty_89. Kudos to this guy. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 13:53:05
Not sure with normal people. But for bitcoin fan, definitely yes!
@_date: 2015-05-05 13:54:42
hm...why not?
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:29:35
probably not the cash-out atm, since the number of bitcoin in this address still increases: 
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:17:29


Banks put its step in..well...well
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:14:46
Well I'd say that this is one of the best new for the starting of 2015's bitcoin industry
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:45:44
@_date: 2015-05-02 04:00:50
Film about bitcoin.
And More.
This is way extremely awesome!
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:46:20
and Charlie Shrem
@_date: 2015-08-29 02:35:58
Happy the cake day. You're here to help the community. Thanks for that.
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:44:05
oh wow, the account is just created recently!
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:42:11
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:27:20
So a typical introvert or psychopath who truly understands what other people think and FEEL? 
@_date: 2015-08-26 14:16:30
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:30:18
bitcoin makes him going hard though
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:53:38
Anybody knows wether Changetip allows user to withdraw that huge amount of bitcoin at once?
@_date: 2015-07-25 05:03:24
Nice conversation though!
@_date: 2015-07-29 05:10:31
created out of thin air, like they always have been doing
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:10:15
you slightly nailed it.
@_date: 2015-08-30 03:00:57
@_date: 2015-07-19 04:37:45
This site is way too cool. Thanks for creating and maintaining it :)
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:23:23
The right one. That's how my grandma got into bitcoin the first time ;)
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:13:41
probably charity is something that sounds good for PR stuff?
@_date: 2015-07-18 05:57:36


Ohh..I extremely like this
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:49:06


You nailed this one.
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:47:00
awesomeness overloadddd
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:19:56
glad to know some updates. Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-07-20 05:37:49


Interesting ;)
@_date: 2015-07-19 11:36:13
most of the time I see the difference remains stable ~ $10
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:26:48
I'm wondering if they allow user to withdraw huge amount of bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:10:52
I was thinking about the same idea..
@_date: 2015-07-26 05:17:06
And also tell them that you will come back acquiring their firm. Completely!
@_date: 2015-07-26 05:05:37
I don't get the joke :(
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:57:32
I personally think that naming would not be a big deal, as long as they can provide a good product with great service. The name will therefore follow the reputation.
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:35:32
is it only me or I find these 2 statements contradict to each  other? 


Then 


@_date: 2015-04-27 04:38:14
Great work. Thanks for keeping it going!!!
@_date: 2015-04-09 05:51:55
wise words
@_date: 2015-04-29 02:56:37
This should be the real use case of bitcoin that people were talking about :)
@_date: 2015-04-11 02:16:28


They nailed it!
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:55:03
[Well well]( ;)
@_date: 2015-09-03 01:48:18
most of destroyers are pre-determined to be builders ;)
@_date: 2015-09-03 01:49:48
any change to expand to Vietnam soon? Cause I'm waiting too long
@_date: 2015-04-29 05:16:59
I'm really looking forward to experience the whole story in a movie. It's gonna be a lot more excited. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:19:10
this 
@_date: 2015-03-09 05:04:51
Nice. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:46:47
@_date: 2015-03-09 05:07:25
thank you :)
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:40:32

@_date: 2015-03-11 02:10:15
I have a secret though :)
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:46:19
Awesome. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:24:40
well said, sir!
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:32:19
Well, fully agree, I'd have to say.
@_date: 2015-03-15 03:46:05
Great. Good luck with the midterms :)
@_date: 2015-03-07 05:59:58
100% agree 
@_date: 2015-10-10 14:28:19
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:37:30
you really do a great work for the entire community. Respect!
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:31:19
is it available in Vietnam?
@_date: 2015-03-08 07:22:24
nice! I prefer the idea of printing Andreas Antonopoulos's face. He deserves it :)
@_date: 2015-10-02 09:05:33
And Vietnam
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:18:58
it's old already...
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:15:49
you nailed it!
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:32:15


Nailed it!
@_date: 2015-03-09 05:07:32
great! Thanks
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:44:32
this should be implied as internal attack..
