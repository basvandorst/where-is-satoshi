That's not very nice. I'm not making any judgment call on whether or not bitcoin is useful. I'm pointing out your platitudes don't give bitcoin value.

You're as misinformed as OP. Message me in at least 10 years when you become a fatcat and everyone else is impoverished because they didn't prostrate themselves at the altar of bitcoin.

There needs to be an incentive to learn the hard solution to a problem when an easy solution already exists.  That's not to say block chain technology won't make some sort of impact on the future, but if there's no incentive to ditch dollars other than a niche ideological distaste for them, bitcoin will always be too difficult to use.
In other words, imagine someone made a more complex version of Reddit because they were ideologically opposed to Reddit. Would you say the more complex version of Reddit is destined to be popular because complexities like the internet caught on? Or is the lack of popularity the result of a needlessly more complex alternative to an already engrained platform?

Going back to my original comment, I'm not saying blockchain technology won't have some impact on the future, but bitcoin definitely is the myspace of cryptocurrencies. [Institutions would sooner adopt the technology before allowing it to usurp anything.](
As long as an easy solution exists for the problem, such as the dollar, bitcoin will remain recondite. If you want to give me a timeline for when bitcoin will be more ubiquitous than the dollar, I'd like to hear it. 
As far as ignoring your comment, I didn't see anything constructive in addressing some points you made because you've betrayed a basic misunderstanding of macroeconomics, namely a preference for deflation to inflation in a currency.

Bitcoin has to clear ACH when transferred into dollars, too. So it's irrelevant if you're talking about dollar markets, you're simply adding more time onto ACH. If you're only concerned about crypto and not dollars, then bitcoin is still one of the slowest ones with some of the worst scalability.

Average 10 minutes per transaction!
I think Bitcoin is revolutionary, but holy shit it's a nightmare making it the cornerstone of the crypto market, let alone any other market.

Do you want to add that to your list of what gives bitcoin value because it wasn't there before. And besides, dirt is fungible. I just gave you 2 buckets of dirt. Go outside and get it! It's yours! Presto, at the speed of information!

This whole thing is too funny.


Our currency is the best currency because it's worth the most dollars.

I had voat in mind, which was started almost exclusively as an ideological combatant to reddit. Digg went downhill because Digg fundamentally changed itself. Unless the dollar somehow fundamentally changes itself, bitcoin will remain comparatively recondite.

Same can be said of dirt.

Did you just compare Bitcoin to Betsy Devos and education vouchers?
