I would just donate to p2p pool miners.  If you (and others) do that regularly it will encourage more p2pool mining in general.

Anything that requires miners to verify their legal identities is a horrible idea, sorry
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:56:12
I was imagining a scenario more like amongst all the blocks there is some outside influence that temporarily reduces actual hash rate, rather than getting unlucky

Think coinbase has been known to be a little overzealous with their fraud flagging, I have never once heard them crediting anything other than the exact amount ordered.

What type of % fee is reasonable to charge for the ability to convert instantly to KHR?  Is it possible to convert instead to USD?  What about biweekly settlements?
How much do transfers of KHR within Cambodia cost?  Would you be in a position to be the broker.. Meaning, if you made a partner with a somoen international, could they deal with just you while you distribute within Cambodia?
Ideally you find someone in Cambodia who will just buy, but the limiting factor here is the existing banking system.

Would be hard to find specific coins like that.  Huge change of honey pot if you find a willing seller as well.  Depending on the amount, dumping to yourself on poker sites, or doing it the more traditional way of faking income on a legit businesses would be the way to go, I think.
Depending on how sketchy your image is within the situation, you can likely just claim to be an early adopter that had coins in an exchange, which would have broken the blockchain evidence anyway.

Bitundo (or someone else) could read a NOUNDO tag off the transaction and not allow attempted double spends on those.  Merchants that need 0 confirmation txs can force customers to use that flag, or else wait for confirmation.  Miners I think are more likely to use this protocol as it keeps the increased profit without making the whole network more prone too double spends (which presumably devalues network, and thus miner profitability)
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:17:51
What, pray tell, is the reason?
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:19:28
You can short on bitfinex
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:22:41
Awesome.  How do you identify?  You should really consider pgp like the way gribble does

The network could have a long term growth in speed with a long round wedged somewhere.. This could potentially create the situation where rounds are on average longer than two weeks over the same period of time that hash rate has gone up.
@_date: 2014-06-25 14:59:00
Effectively true but technically not.  Imagine a difficulty round that lasted an arbitrarily long time in the midst of exploding hash power.
@_date: 2014-01-19 00:19:15
What does that have to do with anything?  I was just saying his math wasn't wrong

3 percent of three thousand is ninety bucks, which he got in points and used toward the five hundred dollar card
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:15:31
I mean, let's say three is a weird bug that makes all asics fail for some long time so all that hash power drops off for months before coming back online suddenly.  Though extremely unlikely there is a mathematical possibility that the average round is longer than two weeks despite long-term parabolic growth.

It's clear that the source for the dense hash function is not being found.  Is the google directory relative to the source files giving the error?
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:48:06
I think you may have missed the thing I was responding to originally
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:55:01
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:12:40
Right.  Improbable but technically and mathematically possible, which is originally what I was responding about.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:38:45
Gavin has said this repeatedly over the years.

Comparing meed to cola based on volume is absurd.  Meed is 12 - 20 or so st my co-op here.  18 shipped is easily fair, especially for those that can't get it locally.

Assuming the speed of your sshfs mount is not causing you problems, it would be fine.  You are probably better off with an SPV client like electrum though, for places that have expensive bandwidth.
You can still run a full node on your vps, but you aren't getting any benefit using "your" version of the blockchain vs relying on the network with an SPV client.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:57:29
Wtf kind of vps cares what you are running.   I pay for a virtual cpu and will damn well max it out if I please.   Change providers,  even if their stated reasons are true that is some bullshit 
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:20:27
I'm just saying based on their response.   But initial syncing is (relatively) cpu intensive. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:53:43
Please publish your algorithm for calculating exchange rate.   
Please also consider letting users maintain seperate btc and dollar balances that can be converted quickly once initial deposits are confirmed.

I've been using sealswithclubs for a while now and though their software is limited it runs on my Linux and they have a good track record.   
They are seemingly underground and not directly targeting the orphaned US market..  Which if you can pull off will be amazing.  That being said,  I would highly encourage you to hire the services of a known bitcoin  expert and publicly talk about how you secure your wallets,  hot wallets and cold wallets,  and how you will protect users from govt seizure,  2fa for withdrawal,  etc.   
The biggest threat to users of bitcoin  services turns out to be amateur operators rather than governments.   I am not saying you are,  just I am skeptical of a company that doesn't have btc specific expertise. 
I wish you luck and encourage you to use the Streisand effect to your advantage when they inevitably come after you for MSB regulation. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:54:03
Wtf is this doing here after 2 hours this is obvious scam.   Published bets never even happened

Gwen was weird before bitcoin..  Awesome..  But weird.   I love reading his stuff and it comes out at such a voracious rate I can't keep up
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:54:58
I looked through the snapshot of the source I had and did not find plaintext references to the addresses,  btc,  it,  or dns listed.   Must just be the binaries 
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:38:38
I think so but am not 100%..  I don't remember turning mine on,  but it was..  But I totally believe I would have played with it when they first started.  It really shouldn't matter though unless you were "playing" with it and had it exposed somehow. Or if your computer was compromised and 2fa was still safe,  they might be able to sniff the key. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:33:54
The key is what you need to protect.   It should be disabled if you aren't using it.

The coinbase app works without the API key..  If it uses the API key then it will stop. Working.

Actually according to quantum mechanics there is an extremely small probability that your gold will spontaneously teleport to my lockbox,  it's actually a quite similar fear.

Interesting I also use the Android app,  but I turned off the API and it works fine..

This is not the pawn shop model,  unless pawncoin is buying the btc at a steep discount. 
Unlike a typical pawn situation where illiquid and sometimes sentimental items are hocked the bitcoin will always be bought back if it's profitable to do so since it is trivial to get a loan for perfectly liquid collateral.   
Consider what happens when I sell btc  and a month later the price drops 50%.   I have no incentive to unhock my btc.   I will just buy it from an exchange. 
Pawncoin can make at most 10% but can lose unbounded. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:12:10
It should be fine if you protect the key..  Also Consider using oauth

Where did you download the wallet? I compiled from source but didn't  see anything..  Though I didn't comb through it

The simplest and most obvious answer is that the US dollar will under go hyperinflation.

Doomed.   Free upside insurance. Sell now..  Price plunges and they are left with the bag.   Price rockets and they make their 10% only.   They can only win if price doesn't fall..  They take all the downside risk without the upside potential
