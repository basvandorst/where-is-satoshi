I started with 80k.  Paid down to 65.  Then went to grad school, but I'm back to 65k or so.

That's awesome, I hope you get there.  You can also get there without BTC, but I know that's way easier said than done.

It's not too bad.  Where do you live?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:49:15
That's awesome, I hope you get it.  Having your own place is a great achievement.

Those are some pretty sweet cars.. good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:42:11
I understand what you want, but I hope you also have something fun/happy to look forward to.

Congratulations :)

How would you enjoy the money?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:41:38
That'd be nice, but that'd require dividends too, right?

That's correct.  You're only taxed on how much you've gained.  If he bought in at $18.5k, and he sold at $19k, he's taxed on the $500.

This is pretty awesome.  I checked out *Gramatik - Muy Tranquilo* and I like it a lot.
How do you help the artists?  You get their stuff uploaded and promoted?

What do you do?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:41:04
I think a lot of people feel like anything is better than nothing.  Sometimes hope is the best motivator.

I used to have a wallet with 10-15 on it.  I ended up formatting my laptop and giving it to my friend.  I didn't think they'd be much of anything at the time.  Hindsight is 20/20.
So you can add my lowly 10 or so to that list.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:57:22
Is that realistic though?  What would really make it shoot up that high?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:44:57
Check out Litecoin.  Atomic swaps and much lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:15:12
That's awesome, congrats.  I bet a lot of people share your view.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:04:50
Good luck!

A college fund is very important.  My daughter will not have any loans.  My wife and I have talked about it.  Even if that means we are taking some out for her.
I've seen how much they've held me back.  I want her to have more than I did and not having student loans will greatly help her.

Or maybe even the freedom of doing something you love, so it's not really work.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:05:09
You can do it, with or without BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:02:03
Good luck bud.  I bet that would be a huge burden lifted off your shoulders.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:57:05
I'd get bored if I didn't have work.. but I also enjoy what I do.  It'd sure be nice to not *have to* work though.

Corvette Z06 is more my style.. but the F12 is a beautiful car :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:13:01
That's an awesome goal.
