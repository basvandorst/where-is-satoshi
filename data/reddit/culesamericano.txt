how do you do this?

Digital Currency
All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft.

It is what it is now, I'm not sure when you last checked it.

Well yeah but that's true for Banks as well, why would they insure money I lose. My concern is a la mt. Gox
It was their fault so it's insured...

What determines if it's coinbases fault or yours? The only way it can be your fault is if someone hacks your account, and that's a risk with a online account.
The problem is when something out of your control happens: coinbase gets hacked, that's when I would need insurance. And they provide that.

Do you hold it in coinbase or you keep transferring it?

Uhh why keep Bitcoin in an online wallet that isn't insured. Coinbase is insured.

Crypto is as well

To sometime that is hodling, how was I affected?

if they get hacked it counts...if an individual account gets hacked its not their fault. i think those policies are fair.

Bought mine off an Amazon seller with good reviews... Am I in the clear?

Using the same device is it possible to delete and open a new wallet on the ledger?
