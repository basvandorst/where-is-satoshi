In my case it's because I'm on a long time sick-leave (don't know the proper phrasing in english) and live off some welfare money I get from the goverment. It's just enough to get by with food and bills but not enough to save anything or pay for expenses that I'm not prepared for. 
I do follow a budget, I just don't have enough money to begin with.

Wow, thanks! 
I love how you can see how much it was worth at the time as well.

Yeah, I mean, there's probably a lot more people like me who doesn't even remember being tipped or people who even didn't get what crypto was all about and saw it as a novelty. He could walk away with thousands without people even knowing about it. It takes a legit guy like that to not commit what is pretty much the perfect crime.

Hear hear. Only thing I would miss is the sense of safety. Det är tryggt sommansäger. 
Where are you living nowadays?

Haha. I don't celebrate much but I'd like to get my girlfriend something. 
Also, it's really dark here in Sweden this time of year so it kind of sucks to be flat out broke, christmas or not.
Yeah, I only sold what's necessary to survive this month and was able to hold on to at least a little bit of btc. If the price haven't gone up too much by januari I'll probably try to reinvest some and see this more as me borrowing from my future self rather than "oh free money".

Not the one you responded but about 2,5 months of summer and a long dark cold winter that will make the most jolly person depressed.
