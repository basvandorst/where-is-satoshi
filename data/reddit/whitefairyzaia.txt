Why would it be? I think the opposite is the case..

It's already rising. 600 in less than an hour. Asia woke up.

I feel suspicious because of how the whales got a foot into this whole thing with the futures and how they have the means to manipulate it to their own benefit. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:57:29
Exactly. I think it only affects the market because people like you think about it and how it might be affected. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:24:27
So what's the general sentiment today?? Europe wakes up and down it goes... 
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:03:58
It's 10400....what are you talkin about?  
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:13:23
Epic 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:17:56
Thumbs up. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:34:54
What does it matter??
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:47:58
The same stupid article over and over again. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:53:39
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:08:28
No. I was referring to around 8 am. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:58:52
So this is just panic sell? The fact that they have to go to court to give out information means nothing... 
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:42:13
It recovered right afterwards.  I think the combination of FUD coming from Korea etc made it dip. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:43:01
I'm not saying it's not possible. I just think that the psychological effect of it is much stronger than the actual one. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:16:38
Thank you. Can we spread the news.  I'm so tired of seeing the same questions about the futures everywhere and how we can expect a dip because of that. Yeah it dips because people panic sell thinking whales are trying to manipulate the market.  Even if they do hedge against their losses they are still not able to move the market as much as panic sellers are. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:08:39
Yeah if you zoom out it does look better.  Thanks for the reply. �� I guess I was getting a bit too excited thinking it would keep growing much quicker... 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:06:49
Do you really believe that? I'm aware of the problems that bitcoin has and how ether is in many ways much more usable.  Ether is my favorite coin... but since crypto currency got so much attention through bitcoin and most people only know what crypto is when you mention bitcoin and with so many noobs coming into the market I thought it would take a very long time for bitcoin to be thrown off 1st rank. But then again the crypto market is moving way faster than anything expected.  
Thanks for your reply. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:15:45
Agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:07:57
Did you find out why ???
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:29:10
What kind of rumours ? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:56:09
I'm aware it's foolish to try to predict anything but based on common sense and general behaviour around holidays and with the year coming to an end ( taxes) ... I can imagine many whales taking their money out temporarily. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:37:57
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:42:23
Ether is one of my top choices, personally... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:10:57
13, 34, 45, 16, 2, 23, 38 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:47:05
Agree. Made some money while it dropped before it hit thw amount I bought it for and then bought in again when it was low. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:24:21
What if you have already major loss and it continues to fall? Wouldn't selling now and buying back make up for it in the long run? There have been so many points in which everyone kept saying this is the bottom, if you sell now you loose...

Worüber hast du deine Bachelor thesis geschrieben? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:24:35
I guess they don't want to see you grow financially.... Elsewhere.
