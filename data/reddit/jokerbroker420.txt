Nah, just buy buy XLM/ stellar lumens.

I’m not sure why anyone is holding BTC, that’s like owning a vcr. Outdated, unscalable, &amp; slow. If your into cryptos to get back at the government, you might wonna get a new hobby, or move somewhere where you agree with the government.

That’s because currently, it is the king, unfortunately. Not for long, hopefully

Without that movie, no one would even know who this guy is.  I put him in the bracket with Mcafee.

Maybe you’re not over your daily limit, but you’re over your monthly limit?! I use cex.io when I don’t have the patience for Gemini, never had any issues

How is this relevant to anything?! Stop posting.

Altcoins, overvalued?! Is that a joke?! BTC is the most over valued coin on the market.

I completely disagree with everything you just said! You think depression only hits poor, abused people, is that a joke?! Personally, I get a big kick out of watching my margin calls closing cause a big candlestick!

We all have very different ideas of "in their right mind".  "Some people just want to watch the world burn!" -Batman, idk which 
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:52:57
Nah, they’re just adding XLM

Savage af.  Is this actually verified by a credible source?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:17:00
If you think I dont check it in between each set, youre mistaken my friend.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:08:28
Why would I not just cash out the cryptos and use cash then?! Probably doesn't help idk what fiat means x.x

How bout they tax 10% of all the fees we pay when trading?!  They get their mad amounts of money, and we still pay .15% fees per transaction.  Seems fair to me :D

I pronounce it "$$$$$"

He threw no facts out when calling us "idiots".  Getting in to an arguement with him would be like arguing with a 4 year old.  Obviously they want it to fail, the banks would suffer.

Quiet time? Is this you insinuating the price will be stagnant for the near future?  You're mistaken my friend, the price will either escalate rapidy, or drop dramatically very, very soon!
