Don’t over think it.  Just buy and HODL.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:34:06
Go get it!  It’s only Crypto.

Expect the unexpected.

The psychology &amp; greed of the whales tells me we dip below $2k.  Greedy fuckers.  Hold your positions.  Accumulate more.

There is certainly huge value with Cryptocurrency in poor countries.  I believe that is one of the reasons why mass adoption is inevitable.  These poor countries with lack of financial resources need Crypto.  The PEOPLE need Cryptocurrency to improve their financial well being.

Why is he a schmuck?  BTC going sub $4k anyways.

The scary part is it can got up or down super fast so make sure you invest what you can afford to loose.

NEVER!!!!!!!  Give me yours, I’ll take it off your hands.  Oh, you probably don’t own any.  Find something better to do TROLL!

Was it a vodka bottle?
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:27:05
Probably.  I think we’ll see low $6k to high $5k before she makes a strong surge again.  Next time to $10k.

Good luck!  I just buy and HODL.  Too much energy and stress selling and buying back in.  I’m sure I’ve left tons on the table that way but my mind and health has value too.  LOL!!!

Why is BTC so valuable then?  Because it’s the first of its kind?
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:31:16
My crystal ball ��

I’m a loan officer in the US and this topic has come up a few times.  Far as I know the issue isn’t with the mortgage company/lender it’s Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac - the investor who we sell our loans too.

It’s going back to $5k once this premature mini jack fades away.
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:13:52
No theory, just Crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:05:01
Dump unfortunately 
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:24:08
It’s gonna go down more.  Keep waiting...
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:59:26
Ethereum is useful.  
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:58:39
But why? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:34:57
Lay off the weeeeeeeeed.

Good point.  FOMO keeps me in 24/7.  When I buy it goes down, if I sell I’m sure it will go up.  Just buy and HODL.
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:05:56
Good point.  These situations will always happen and when your the statistic the feeling sucks hard.  But when you read other people’s mistakes we be like... dumb ass.  Sorry dude for your loss, we’re not to a point yet (probably never will be) where there are laws, rules or tactics in place to protect ourselves for mistakes like this.  Go buy another BTC and move on.  Kinda like a relationship when it goes sour, best way to move on is find another piece.  Good luck!

She’s definitely hotter than BTC, especially in this market.
