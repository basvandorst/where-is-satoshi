Truth is im banned for "spam".  
And i was posting 3 posts a day, 2 of them in my own 2 topics.  
Yet known scammers like Borsurplus that i was DUMPING on, are there with perfect reputation and trust.  Even tho there LOADS of people he scammed.  
They all get banned so cannot post trust.  
You think this ass covering happends for free?!  
Im banned only for stepping toes of pump groups.

I was banned because Bob [main scammer] and DGB bagholders were flagging me.  
I did not spam anything, i hardly do more than 3 posts a day and 2 of them in my own threads that i started.  
Mods only looked that some peopel flag me and banned me without checking.  
After that they banned an user saying im banned by mods - also for "spam" while all he did was 2 posts and all got deleted too.  
  
can you check ? Maybe its not theymos but some mods are into this circle of scamming people that i tried to break...
