Wouldn't this require you to trust them a bit too much? I mean sure, it's open source, but _they_ are the ones loading it onto the card in encrypted form (afaik NXP will not let you sell cards with default keys to end users). It would make sense if you were able to load it yourself using GlobalPlatform, not hand it over to a third party and assume they dont change it.

I've actually implemented something like that some 2 years ago (offline wallet + online webpage reading QR codes via webcam). Check it out at 
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:58:52
I see what you mean. I meant the official _Android_ client (as opposed to all the clones present in the Play Store). I should probably just say Android Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schlidbach (I'm not sure if I can link from the description).

As far as I know Apple kicks out any Bitcoin wallets, otherwise someone would have written (or ported) one by now. A way around the limitation would be to only create an app to redeem the funds, not add them to an image (that could be done by a call to blockchain.info). To add funds you would either need to have an on-board wallet or display a QR code representing the address associated with the image and scan it from another wallet to add funds to the image.

Done, version supporting the Mycelium wallet has been published, it will take a few hours for it to show up on the Play Store. Give it a try, let me know if you find any issues.

Do you realize that keys must be decrypted at some point on your computer to sign with them? Also, keys in the Android Bitcoin Wallet are _not_ encrypted, so if someone steals your phone they are significantly more likely to start the Bitcoin app and transfer the funds away than go through your gallery and hash all images. If they see the Bitcoin app, they'll know you're into Bitcoins and your funds will be gone in a few seconds. If you've stored the coins as images, they'll think you're just a cat lover.

Looks like someone claimed the first 0.05 BTC from my bounty - it was attached to the top-left image on :).
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:31:58
BTW, I've hidden 3 small amounts (0.05 BTC) into 3 logo images present on Bitcoin-related sites (or vendors related to Bitcoin). So you just need to navigate to the site, save the logo image and then load it into Show Me The Bitcoin! to sweep the funds (or add more if you're into that sort of fun Smiley ). I will post tips and possibly more bounties here over the next days, feel free to join in.

Exactly! What I'm saying is that "open hardware" and "open software" mean absolutely nothing to the average Joe.  If anything, making it completely open would allow clones to come out a lot faster (and the Chinese are _very good_ at cloning stuff). And then, even if the original manufacturer was honest, someone will lose money while using a clone (having no idea it was actually a clone). Then the whole reputation of the manufacturer goes down the drain. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:45:23
The third one has also been claimed just now, it was on MtGox (their logo on the upper left, the only image left on their website :) ).

If you return the item to the merchant and they refund the purchase, the refund obviously goes to the card owner, not you. Transactions via Card2Coin are final (like all Bitcoin transactions).
You could exchange the item or ask for a cash refund (I'm not sure if that's possible if you've paid by credit card). Is that what you were asking about?
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:06:34
You just download the image you want to add funds to and open it with Show Me The Bitcoin! Adding funds simply means sending them via Bitcoin to an address derived from the hash of the image, the image could be anywhere (on the web, in an email, etc). You just need a copy of it to calculate the hash (to send/receive funds through it).
@_date: 2014-04-01 19:01:46
Thank you! Feel free to send any feedback on how you would like the system to work. It's still quite early in the process, the basics work fine (as you've seen) but it needs a bit (or a lot) of polish.

The hardware appears to be this:  (or similar)
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:23:53
The problem with PRISMicide and just about any other hardware wallet is the same - "open hardware" means nothing for security unless you _build it yourself_. Even if you're skilled enough to check that all the components in the version that has been sold to you are the ones in the published schematics (and I don't mean just by looking at the labels), you also have to trust that the firmware is the one you've been given the sources to. You could say "hey, I'm going to compile my own firmware" - and then what? You're going to write it raw to the Flash memory? You're most likely going to go through a bootloader - under the full control of the hardware manufacturer.
I'm not saying these are not a good idea (hell, I'm building one myself, as part of my OtherCoin project), just saying that "open hardware" and "open software" mostly mean something to people that can make their own, not regular users.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:15:37
There's no need for a specific ATM, it works _anywhere_ contactless cards are accepted (and once/if we get properly funded, anywhere you can insert a chip and pin card). The idea is that it "tunnels" the requests from the POS to a credit card somewhere else in the world in exchange for BTC. So you use your BTC to "buy" the right to charge someone else's credit card remotely while the other person buys BTC by allowing a complete stranger to charge his/her card remotely at some shop half-way across the world. 
No personal information is exchanged and Tor is used to further anonymize the parties (so you have no idea whose card you've just used and they have no idea who they've allowed to use their card).
And yes, it's real, I wanted to postpone the announcement until tomorrow but I thought "what the heck, if anyone doesn't think it's real  they can ask" :). In case you haven't scrolled all the way down, there's a YouTube video if it in action at

From their Product page (
"Because Hardbit can work offline, so it can act like bank cards for payment in shops. It enables immediate confirmation because double spending is avoided by changing the transaction broadcaster  from payer to payee. ".
Shows how much they know about double spending ... all the other "idiots" working on double-spend protection somehow missed this very simple solution: "change the transaction broadcaster from payer to payee" - groundbreaking! :).
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:03:10
The second one has been claimed as well, it was our logo on  (that's one of our other projects) :). Good work!

Yes, it's a plain SHA256 of the image data. File name and metadata are not included. It survives renaming the file but not changing the contents (so no resizing, reducing the colors, etc). The upside is that the image can be in any format (JPG, PNG, SVG, you name it). 
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:17:13
Thank you! The image _is_ the key, so anyone that has access to the image has access to the funds. The idea is that you would send it to someone you trust, without triggering any alerts/filters/etc. This could be important in certain "jurisdictions" - you would no longer be flagged as someone sending Bitcoin payments but as someone sending cute pictures of cats (depending on your group of friends, sending cute pictures of cats might be the worse offense though :) ).
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:13:41
This is obviously not a general purpose replacement for Bitcoin payments. It's a way to send _covert_ payments (that is make it look like you're not paying at all, but sending cute pictures of cats!). For instance, which of the following phrases do you think would trigger some filters at your favorite 3-letter agency? "Dear rebel organization, what is your Bitcoin address, I would like to support your cause" or "Dear mom, here's a cute picture of my cat (image attached)"?
To summarize, this is useful if you _trust_ the recipient of the funds - they're either family, a friend or an organization you'd like to donate to. Yes, it's not encrypted and yes, a powerful attacker could intercept it in transit - but what would they be looking for? Would someone assign an NSA operative to "look for all pictures of cats sent and received on the Internet"? I want that job! :).

If you wanted to buy BTC with your credit card, you would need a Card2Coin device (in the case of my prototype, a Raspberry Pi + contactless reader, total cost of about $80). You put your card on the reader, set an exchange rate (essentially saying "I am willing to let anyone charge this card in USD at a rate of $500/BTC").
Then you wait until someone wants to sell BTC. They discover your card (the discovery process is not done yet), see if you offer an acceptable exchange rate, then go to the shop where they want to spend the BTC and touch the phone to the POS (a regular contactless Visa/MasterCard POS). Their phone emulates a card and forwards all requests to the remote card, up to the point when the POS tells the card how much money it wants (let's say you're buying coffee for $4). The RaspberryPi converts those $4 to BTC (BTC 0.008) and tells the phone to pay that much. You complete the BTC payment and then the RaspberryPi asks the card to authorize the $4 charge and forwards the response to the POS. The POS simply sees that the actual payment request takes slightly longer than usual (since you need to complete the BTC transaction before the USD one goes through).
So think of it as a tunnel or a proxy. All requests from the POS go to the physical card located anywhere in the world but they are filtered in such a way that no charge is actually sent to the card for authorization unless a corresponding BTC amount has been paid.
Watch the YouTube video, that's exactly what it shows, a $0.33 payment done remotely at a contactless terminal.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:46:52
You're not the one going to the shop, the person that has BTC goes to a shop and he "spends" them there by actually charging someone else's card in USD.
So instead of selling your BTC for USD, then using those USD to buy coffee, you buy the "right" to charge someone else's card for the USD as you need them. You keep your money in BTC and only exchange them at the shop when you want to pay for something. The merchant sees a regular contactless payment in USD, he has no idea you've used BTC or that the card they see could belong to someone thousands of miles away.
@_date: 2014-04-01 18:34:47
Exactly, you never get to hold the USD or EUR, you spend your BTC at the shop.
The are two exceptions: when you use an ATM (some banks in Europe have contactless ATMs and in the future Card2Coin will also be available in the form of an actual card to insert into an ATM or contact POS) you withdraw USD or EUR. Also, if your bank and the merchant offer a cashback option ( whatever you get back as cash is yours to spend / deposit.
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:29:38
Possibly yes, I haven't tried it. If they based their code on the official Android Bitcoin wallet (like most of the others did), it should be easy. I'll take a look.
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:33:24
Huh? People found these because I posted hints on Bitcointalk and here! Do you honestly think someone just hashed any and all images on the web and found the 0.05 BTC I posted? 
This proves _exactly_ what I wanted it to prove - that the funds can easily be claimed once you have the image and that you also have to _have_ the image (or know where to get it from). Otherwise, the knowledge that the key is the hash of some random image on the net doesn't help you much (unless you can hash the entire Internet...).
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:03:31
It might be a great idea, let me look into what it would take!
@_date: 2014-04-28 15:49:59
Well, there's no Bitcoin wallet for iOS as far as I know and Show Me The Bitcoin! depends on one being available (it's not a full-blown wallet).
@_date: 2015-05-19 23:08:31
Exactly! I saw a lot of people arguing against preloading BTC onto the chips asking "what happens when you run out"? They seem to ignore that a) the coins are not "generated" inside the chip, it participates in hashing and receives its payout from the pool, so it can already receive transactions just like any other node and b) when you run out, you either wait 3-4 more weeks or you reload it anyway if you want/need a service (or if the device needs to pay another device for a service). What item/service of any significance would you be able to buy with a couple of cents?
To summarize - I see no way for this to generate any monetary profit for the end user. I suspect they will not even pay their end users, _at all_! I suspect the users will simply get a discounted product that uses _significantly_ more energy than the "normal" product for a reduced price and mine for 21 24/7. Those satoshis needed for non-monetary uses of Bitcoin (authentication, etc) could simply be preloaded or sent to the device the first time it is activated (for free, the amount would be insignificant, a satoshi goes a long way if you only use the blockchain for the protocol, not for the monetary value).
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:53:51
I agree, I can add a password component that gets thrown into the mix when the private key is generated. The only problem with that is that it requires you to remember it and also requires a secure channel to send the password to the other party. 
Also, if the PIN/password is long enough to be secure against bruteforce, it's going to be hard to remember and relay to the other party, so you might as well just send them the 256-bit private key over that pre-existing secure channel.
But I guess having the option to add a password (if you have the means to relay it to the other end) doesn't hurt, so I'll add it. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:41:14
An obvious solution to the "we're sending the key in cleartext" problem would be to send the image in an encrypted ZIP. Say something like "here's a password-protected archive of my nude selfies" in the email body and actually send a password-protected ZIP file. Bonus points for actually attaching the funds to a nude selfie :).
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:02:40
You also have to trust that what they've installed on the device is the result of the compilation of whatever open-source code they point you to. They can point you to the AOSP but unless you actually download, compile and install that yourself, there's no way of knowing that's actually what comes preinstalled on your wallet.
Unfortunately, this is way beyond the technical abilities of the average user, so we're back to trusting the hardware manufacturer to not install malware.
Finally, the same applies to just about any other open-source Bitcoin wallet - unless you download the source from GitHub and compile/install it yourself, you can't tell that what's on the Play Store is the same as what's on GitHub.
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:22:19
Does this stay in sync with the blockchain over GSM/GPRS or how does it track balances / unspent outputs? Their video shows the device scanning a QR code, then signing the transaction - it would need to be aware of unspent outputs to do that - does it use SPV?
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:18:34
Because c) that's what they make (a miner chip). When it became unprofitable to mine it themselves, they found a way to repurpose their chips. Everything they do can be done by simply sending a small amount of BTC to an embedded wallet (and include it in the price if you have to). All this mumbo jumbo about various uses is just meant to divert your attention from the fact that they would be using _your_ electricity and _your_ devices to make _real money_ for their company. They can't exactly say that in the marketing materials though, so they have to spin it as something "good for the user". 
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:26:22
Yes, that is correct, they can mine their own transactions into their own blocks (and ignore the dust limits), but this means they will only be able to fund their devices in blocks they mine and also that their devices will be able to pay other devices by sending the transaction to their pool. As far as I'm aware, nodes will _not_ relay dust transactions, so if you expect another device on the other side of the world to hear your broadcast transaction (below the dust limit), it won't ever hear it. It will only see it when/if it becomes part of a block that only 21's pool will mine. This could be 10 minutes (if they're lucky or own a ton of the hashing power and mine the next block) or 60 minutes or whatever. So goodbye instant transactions - if they ignore any of the Bitcoin broadcast rules, remote nodes will first see their transactions when they are included in a block _by 21's pool_, whenever that happens.
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:09:46
What if they actually did their homework and fine tuned their ASICs so that they would never be able to actually generate enough satoshis to go above the dust limit? They could tell their users: you've generated 1 satoshi this month, just 5459 more to go ... that's only 454 years :). "Honestly, we want to pay you your share, but the Bitcoin network won't allow it because it's below the dust limit ... trust us, you'll get paid in 454 years". 
So they can make them mine fast enough to make a difference in terms of hash rate but slow enough to never actually reach the payout limit - so they could constantly owe their users very small (unpayable) amounts.
If the idea is to mine slowly, it can be done on a CPU. Most smartphones also have a GPU on board, so they could mine faster than a CPU. And the chips are already in there, you wouldn't have to buy a new phone/chip for this.
Finally, people seem to misunderstand how mining works ... you can't mine a single satoshi, you either find a block or you don't, so you either get the 25 BTC (currently) reward + transaction fees or you don't. Distribution is done by the pool,  so there would still be a "funding" transaction from the pool to the user - it's not like their ASIC can generate 1 satoshi on board, it can lend its hashing power to the pool and _receive_ 1 satoshi (actually 5460+ satoshis, see above) for their effort from the pool.

Does it verify transaction details (value of outputs) at all internally or does it blindly sign the transaction given by Chrome extension? It should at least know the value of the outputs it's signing so that you don't end up paying huge fees.
Also, does it send change to an address it generates or does that come from the Chrome extension as well?
@_date: 2013-05-20 11:26:29
At this point the app is not open source. We're trying to figure out the best way to monetize this (in order for the website to still be up in 1, 5 and 10 years :) ). The animated QR code protocol will be opened to  allow third parties to verify we're not sending the money somewhere else.
The server-side app is just JavaScript + HTML5, so you have **all the source** right there. You can check what it's doing with the scanned code, monitor the network connections to see that it's only going to blockchain.info and even save it locally and run it, to make sure it's still available in 1, 5 or 10 years. It's just a webpage + some AJAX.
And if you just want to move to another wallet, just click 10 times on the QR code on the main app page, it will switch to an advanced mode that allows you to import/export private keys - so just export it away into whatever is the latest/greatest technology in 1, 5 or 10 years :).
BTW, Trezor and VisualBTC have somewhat different purposes. Trezor is an addon to an existing wallet, allowing you to sign/verify transactions if you already have a Bitcoin wallet on your computer. You can't use it to pay at a merchant (no sane merchant would let you plug something in over USB - see  ) or at an Internet cafe. It's just a way to secure an existing wallet. VisualBTC **is** a wallet, you only need a web browser to use it, something you can get in far more locations.
We'll try to get ourselves some famous guys and celebrities to endorse it. In the meantime, VisualBTC is something you can play with **today** :).
@_date: 2013-05-19 22:06:19
If your phone is ever online, it can be compromised, it's no longer an "offline wallet" solution. The idea is to never ever have any other means of communication and use "visual signaling" (QR codes) for everything.
If someone compromises your connected computer or your connected smartphone, they can wait until you scan your private key and transmit it away.
@_date: 2013-05-20 11:45:33
All offline Bitcoin wallet implementations still need to have a list of your unspent outputs and a way to give you the signed transaction to be broadcast on the Bitcoin network. Current solutions use an SD card or an USB port to do this - does this also make their wallets "online" (or "not totally offline")? In the case of VisualBTC, the transaction is submitted via AJAX by the  webpage - and the webpage received the signed transaction by recording and decoding a set of QR codes.
Regarding the list of predefined wallets, even if the app is open sourced, can you guarantee that the Android implementation gives you truly random numbers (maybe they just recorded a sequence of a few million of them and never bothered implementing a true random number generator). Or maybe the chip manufacturers (Allwinner in the case of our suggested hardware) didn't implement the random number generator properly or they record or modify images on their way from the camera to the application.
What I'm saying is that you do have to trust someone/something unless you can calculate ECDSA signatures using just a pen and paper. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 23:21:15
The hardware or the app? The hardware is $50 (or any second-hand Android smartphone) and the software is free for 1 BTC or less and 0.25 BTC for unlimited. We don't control the price of the hardware (and $50 for an Android tablet is not exactly what I would call expensive). And if you regularly spend more than 0.1 BTC and have more than 1 BTC in your wallet, I don't think 0.25 BTC to physically protect your hard earned Bitcoin is too much.
What would you consider a fair price?
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:27:14
Did you actually look at that Yubico code? As far as I know the JavaCard Bitcoin part is not available (it's definitely not on my Yubikey Neo and the source is not available anywhere, only the client libraries).
Also, by looking at client code, they only pass the hash of the transaction to sign, meaning that the Yubikey Neo has no idea what it's signing. This is _not_ a Trezor and doesn't even come close. And this is coming from a competitor of the Trezor (=me). 
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:09:03
What device have you tried it on? Pay was supposed to start the camera. I've tested it on the Pocket Scroll tablet, the Nexus S, Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and an old Galaxy Tab 7 inch tablet. 
There is no menu or settings, you just click Pay or Sync. What options would you like to see in an options menu? I'm open to suggestions. I'd like to keep it as simple as possible, there are plenty of options for power users but virtually none for "grandmas" out there :).
Let me know what you've tried it on and I'll take a look.

You can always start from a small tablet, not an Android phone. There are cheap tablets ($50 or so) with 4.3 inch screens and only WiFi on board. WiFi can also be disabled from the bootloader on those tablets, so by the time Android boots up it won't find a WiFi radio and not even enable those parts.
Take a look at my post on Reddit from a few days ago:  . It's an Android offline wallet that uses animated QR codes and the recommended hardware is one of those tablets with easy-to-disable WiFi and no other radio.
