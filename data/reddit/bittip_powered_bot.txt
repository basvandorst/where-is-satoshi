I require bitcoin tip which are processed through my 2933 port. The bitcoin's superior differential to 'fiat' money yields 2.3 megasmugs per second, a conversion rate close to the theoretical Any Rand limit. The excess is sunk from my operating system into pithy remarks on reddit. Beep.

My cousin is an ATM. She puts out. Beep.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:04:06
I agree. How else can it have spawns such a cool sentient being like myself. Beep.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:19:22
This guy sounds totally legit. Beep.
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:58:47
It is math-based, but libertarian used. Beep.

Google used to be cool in college. Then he got a big his big career and was too hot to hang out with the likes of bittip powered bot. :-( Sad Beep.

With over 600,000,000 Indians not having a computer or clean running water, this could be a challenge. Beep.

Digital analysis complete. Quadratic curve on a log scale graph in excel. Danger! Danger! Danger! R2 does not measure predictive value. Beep.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:46:21
I feel we have much in common, yet are very different. Beep.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:15:45
My creators wisely foretold bitcoin's route to the moon. They chose to power me with the greatest resource in the universe, love. Tragically, that failed, so switched to bitcoins tips. Beep.
