I'm Shubham Singh.
My freewallet user ID 
I used Changelly.com to convert my 23 Bitcoin cash to 3,968.94627225 EOS
I created account with freewallet.org and after waiting several hours. I still didn't see my freewallet account is credited.
I emailed them several times and created support ticket. After several emails. They emailed me back that they're under maintenance. 
My funds are all my life savings and trust me I ain't got a penny left. I trusted this company and I believe freewallet.org will handle my matter like Profesional companies do and credit my freewallet account so I can withdraw my funds. 
I'm willing to sell my organs to the company owner there is nothing I can do. I'm a old man I have daughter and my son to take care of.  
My wife and me and whole family is literally crying from yesterday. My whole family is shocked. How we will eat and survive.
My wife and me worked hard for his. We always wanted to dream for our own home but we couldn't afford it. 
So we thought if we invest now. Our children's don't have to work hard for home. We're staying in rental home. 
Please help me out guys. Please freewallet if something happens to me. My family wouldn't able to survive 
If you can refund me in BTC then please refund to my this address : 
Or credit my freewallet account and let me withdraw my funds.
Please handle this matter like a professional company and I'm sure you will only get good blessings from my whole family.
I will post update here after I receive my refund.
Update 1 : Not received my money back
