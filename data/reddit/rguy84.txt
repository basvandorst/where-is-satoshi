I haven't done much with BTC lately, but I have had transactions take 48 hours to be verified according to blockchain

I want to say yes, but don't quote me on that.

But not the other two channels

This made me ill reading that. The one thing I wish Justin mentioned is alternatives. Some people mentioned GitHub might not be the best place

Can a Mod add these to the sidebar?

Saw this while browsing SO, and thought some would find it interesting

I would love to hear why you think that. I have close to 900 people on Facebook, and seen one post about BTC since I have been following it. So, in my *"circle"*, 0.002% know about it from what I could tell. I talk to 15-20 people (family and friends) regularly. None of them know about it.

It is ultimately your call. Personally I would be like "I am honored and all, but I would love to work with you and make superCoolAwesome stuff for you guys." You never know.

Did you give them permission to?

My company mandated this type of training, and two weeks later sent emails out to test people. I don't know how many they did, but 20 people clicked on the link to "reset their password."

Thanks, I only did one so far. It took a good week or so to hit my payout (58ubtc), so I don't think it should clog, or are you saying whenever they pay it will be like 2 uBTC at a time?

FTFY :)

I am not an app developer, but somewhere I read that there is only a few choices app developer can choose from. They are like: ability to install/run and use memory; that + internet access; or the kitchen sink. Developers could write their own processes, so they can do internet access and whatever feature they need or they can just say Google give me the sink and I'll use it responsibly.

Serious Question:
I have the bitcoin app on my phone, is there a way to lock the app besides setting a pw on the phone? Is the BlockChain app more secure?
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:27:38
Can you comment how much it cost versus the listed price on the menu?

Don't forget the D&amp;D DM!

OT: OP I tried to get to your link, my work's firewall didn't like you. Sometimes it doesn't like the content, other times it sees hidden crap

The only argument I could think of is he got a gyft account, but you probably need to be 18+.

This is the same city Colbert did a report on a few months ago. [linky](
