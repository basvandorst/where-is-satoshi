So your response amounts to:
"I'm going to not really answer but make it looks like I did, ignoring the intent of the question."
"Because I've never seen deflation happen. Despite the fact that it has, though rare."
"I can't answer but I don't want to show that off to the public."

I wasn't commenting on the validity of the original posters query (though you are correct it was definitely flawed). I was just commenting on the validity of exab's response to it. I do appreciate the pointer though - I was so focused on how exab's response didn't fit the question, I admit I didn't logically examine the question either.
Have a great day on the internet and please keep posting nice things of actual intellectual value, and not just randomly screaming at people. It's legitimately refreshing.

Actually, the way it's structured, it physically can't describe itself. You could say it's false (and can certainly make an argument to that effect), but saying "That describes your comment" doesn't make any logical sense.
Nice to know people can still win arguments by ending them in an insult, though.

Gotta admit, immediately confirming an insult is the weirdest comeback I've ever seen. Been fun talking to ya, pal. You've basically confirmed that you never plan to actually make sense/a logical point, so I'll chalk this down to a "debate won by default" and move on.
Have a lovely day, I suppose.

So rather than respond to my post, you said "I don't have to listen because everyone knows you're stupid" and then gave yourself a pat on the back.
I actually don't mind cryptocurrency as an investment (as it is right now, it's a speculative investment and not a functional currency) but I begin to realize why this reddit is... taken less than seriously by the uninitiated.
