@_date: 2014-02-20 17:25:20
I don't think this is true at all.  I would say that it's a best practice to double spend an unconfirmed transaction if you can't wait for it to confirm but need that money.  Otherwise you're at risk of Goxing yourself and resending money if that txn does eventually get confirmed.  The Bitcoin network will confirm those transactions.  I'll do a double spend like this as an example if you'd like.

To those (many) who don't know what a backup plan is, you need to follow the 321 rule.  
* 3 copies in 
* 2 different formats
* 1 offsite
Then you need a tested recovery plan.  I can't count how many times people (including myself) think I have a backup, until shit goes wrong  and I find my backups been sitting there uselessly comforting me for years.
The simplest way I could see to accomplish the above would be have two paper wallets and your key burned on a cd.  But one of the paper wallets off site.
4 times per year recovery your wallet by sending your coins to a new address.  You'll have to stash your new paper/cd wallets and file your old ones.
Another note, is this is a hindrance to security (eg having 2 paper wallets is more likely to get stolen than 1).  If you want to do this a bit more securely, you should encrypt your backups or use Armory's fragmented backups.

Here's the idea that leads people to think they're insolvent.  Not sure if these are facts, but I'm just repeating the ideas I've heard.
* mtgox automatically reissues payments if they can't find them on the network (assuming they've failed, which they usually have)
* if the above is true, the the transaction malleability could have cause mtgox to reissue payments automatically.
* the modified transactions propagate better than the original
If the above is true (again I'm just repeating what I've heard), then mtgox could drain their hot wallet fast.  Further, if they had a lot holding in a hot wallet or didn't have checks in place then they could have drained much of their bitcoin resources.

You need a dose of reality.  Bitcoins are difficult to buy.  Why?  Well first let me tell you how easy they are to buy.  I sold $1000 of Bitcoin the other day.  It took maybe 15 seconds which was 90% formalities.  
Why was you're exchange not like that?    You live in a country with limited freedom of transaction.  Money especially in large quantities, must be traceable, it's your gov'ts requirement.  If you're mad a robocoin, you're mad at the wrong entity.  If you're realizing that you're monetary restrictions are actually impacting you're life and looking stupid, don't come in here and throw a fit blaming everyone who's telling you where the problem is.
Take the Bitcoin you got and send it to the EFF.

Sorry,I should have explained better. Filtering by IPs doesn't work because there are reasons why your IP wouldn't match your nationality or current location.  The simplest example would be a Canadian on vacation in the states.  In that case cavirtex shouldn't filter that IP.  Another case would be an American with a Canada IP (perhaps because of a VPN for work).  If cavirtex didn't warn that user they could be forfeiting deposited funds, that would be much worse than displaying a message to everyone.
I'm not for what cavirtex is doing my I'm against using IPs for filtering.
The most sensible fix would be to not allow deposits from users who can't withdraw.

I assume Ver was truthful and gox did have the coins when he said it, but that situation changed while the customers assumed it did not.  I think that to avoid this sort of situation exchanges should sign a message from their cold storage to prove their reserves.  It would make sense to incorporate this into their quarterly disaster recovery tests.
For my small stash of cold storage bitcoin, I test them monthly by sending a nominal amount to a charity.
Is it reasonable to expect that from exchanges, or would that be too onerous/optimistic?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:22:56
The part that seems hardest to explain is why no one noticed it if happened over a long period of time.  I can stretch my mind to believe they didn't have a cold wallet, there was no check in place to see if withdrawals are valid, and Bitcoins were sent ad nauseum.  But EVERYBODY likes to look at their stash. 
It doesn't have to be part of an audit our anything just checking "how much fucking money do I have?".  How did that just not happen?

A bet on mining is just that, a bet that mining will be profitable.  Miners don't care if BTC is $1000 of $1, they care that about the amount of dollars they can make per day.
Of course if BTC goes up, then usually there is a temporary period where profitability is up as well, though often this is met with lower margins in the long term.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:16:37

Most web wallets that have been robbed (but not all) have been because of poor user security.  Blockchain.info had a vulnerability, but is reimbursing users out of their pocket.
You can use web wallets, just be smart about it.  My password for blockchain.info is something like:
This is saved in my LastPass account (with 2fa) which has an 8 word dice pass such as 'virus tapis tang ladle cohen winter boone ivy' (~100 bits of entropy).  
This is secure enough that as long as the computer I use are clean, then this is safe.
While that is reasonable security, I don't store more than I'd need to spend in a day on blockchain.info.  
Use paper wallets for the rest and get use to using them.  There really easy to make and spend.

Try turning some of the negatives into a positive.  One thing I often hear is that BTC is somehow illegitimate because it's often used to buy drugs.  I think it's fair to say that if you tried to give a drug dealer some funny money you'd end in trouble.  To me that makes it very legitimate.

Transaction on confirmed in blocks which which are solved ~10 minutes.  If you are 10%, or 0.0001% of the network hashrate and you remove yourself, you will have no long term effect on the confirmation time.  So you are not contributing to network.  If you the network was dying out and confirmation weren't happening then you'd have a point.

Thanks for the reply.  I think you're site needs to explain things better in general.  When I made the sale, I realized I didn't have any idea how the site was suppose to work beyond matching buyers and sellers.  Escrow service, transaction service, etc. needs to be obvious and streamlined.  Perhaps when someone contacted me for the sale it should explain how to use the transaction system.
Also, I just looked at this now, and the payment address doesn't have a qr code.

The irony is funny, but that's not explicitly what Bitcoin stands for.  I would say it would be more accurate to just say irreversible transactions as a feature of Bitcoin, not that they shouldn't be reversed.  Most likely escrow services will take the place of Visa/Paypal and will hopefully be more reasonable since it's much easier to move between escrow providers.

There is almost no fees (after 2 years of using 3 ING accounts I have paid no fees).  Depending on your needs you might also pay [zero fees](  The big fee is see there is $25nsf, but they have a decent overdraft so unless you're going way over it shouldn't be an issue. 
They pay a small amount of interest.  Can't remember how much.

I think he did a great job explaining Bitcoin in an understandable and friendly way.  He had a few other interesting thing to say about cultural trust in currencies that I found interesting as well.
It wasn't awesome by any stretch, but it had some good points.

You won't make money with your current rig, not even pennies per day.  
If you got rid of your 780 and picked up a couple 7950s then you could make a bit doing Litecoin Mining.  Come join us over at or hit up the litecoin forum.

$10 spread!  I hope that's not the best option.  If you can wait then cavirtex shouldn't work.  Site down right now but I think it should be pretty simple
* transfer BTC in (minimal BTC fee)
* trade BTC for CAD (3% trade fee)
* CAD to your bank by interac $6.  This usually takes about an hour.
So I guess about $66 in fees.
How did you get scammed?
@_date: 2013-06-27 16:50:54
Those fees are way to high for me to consider.

The optimistic view: 1-10 should qualify in a few years if there is only 0.003 per person.  I'm a Bicoinaire.

I tried this as well, but since most js calls are asynchronous it executes them all at once.  I'm glad I'm not the only one who went down that path.

The price has historically followed mtgox even though the price doesn't reach parity.  That is gox moves up $5 first then bitstamp/coinbase/btc-e rarely the other way around.

I forgot my password. It was a 10 word phrase and I couldn't remember it quite right. I ended up writing a program to do small modifications on the phase until I found the password. Was very relieving to get my 150 Litecoins back.

Thanks, but I didn't really like that much.  I only listened to one episode, but it really sucked (eg suggested LTC mining on a atom board with one PCIe slot).

Good info, but it reminds me of the days when you couldn't text message between carriers.  Sure we could all just use one, but that has it's issues as well.

There are so many ways to scam buyers on eBay. Tracking, signature, verified addresses, not accepting refunds whatever still doesn't make it 100% safe for the seller. I know from selling high dollar items in PayPal. PayPal sides with the buyer 99 out of 100 times. You can scam any buyer any time out if an item with only legal recourse which is usually not with worth it internationally for &lt;$1000 items. 
Your concern and advice is good, but using PayPal and eBay is dangerous and every seller should be aware of the risks.

This frustrates me because your site is designed to use escrow.  Otherwise no feedback can be left.  I had filled out a support request because I wanted to know if there was a way to receive feedback for a localbitcoins trade no using escrow. 
 This was the response I received this morning.:








Should I conclude that we are to not use escrow or feedback for local transfers?

What are you trying to accomplish?  You don't need beefy hardware to run bitcoind. A decent HDD will help though. CPU/RAM and network are mostly negligible for anything modern.

Why is localbitcoins risky?

Canadian as well.  I tried to take out $6000 from RBC and they said I should have called ahead and could only give me $2000.  I was shocked they didn't have $6000.  This has happened on two occasions for similar amounts.
@_date: 2013-08-03 01:23:12
Sounds good.  YAC would be a good one to add to that list.
@_date: 2013-06-28 17:32:19
There's 1626 words in the JS file 12 words per passphrase so 
1626^12 = 341543870028173427817970975906355941376 passphrases.
If you could try 2 billion passwords per second that would take 5.412×10^21 years. 
So that's unfortunately not an option.

44% per month. Sorry to rain on your parade..  You're not stuck with them though. Throw them up on ebay or cl and mine in the meantime.

I had a pretty good idea of my password so I just generated a few thousand with php and ran a bash script.  It was nothing fancy, but I didn't really keep it around.  I believe that everything I found regarding that was just found on bitcoin talk.  I think now ocl hashcat or jtr should be able to do more complex recovery.  
@_date: 2013-09-19 17:44:04
Agreed!  Cash flow is an issue for us, and we had to sacrifice other things to get 2 weeks (higher fees).

Gender is not relevant. Even if it was an asset she was by far the least qualified.  From reading her responses it sounded like she was just trying to jam buzz words into her responses with minimal understanding.  If lobbying is important we need someone with a better understanding anyway.

Partially for me it's not about disagreeability.  Most of the candidates are not reasonable agreeable even to most people.  Elizabeth had a bit of a 'apple pie and ice cream' platform (in fairness most others did), in that I really don't disagree with her because she's saying very agreeable things. That doesn't necessarily make her a good candidate and I think misses the issues that the parent has with her.
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:41:58
I agree mostly, and would add on that a lot of people aren't ready/willing to "be their own bank" with Bitcoin.  Losing Bitcoin, theft, security are all things I'm sure people would happily pay a bank to avoid.
