I think it is just continuing on with its rollercoaster ride.  It is probably going to be months before it stabilizes.

True.  But the other side of it is the entire rollercoaster ride you see going on with it right now is created by the problem of people who don't understand investing.  They seem to think it is an overnight thing, when the true value of investing comes from holding for long term, and in having a tangible item that can move with the value of money, as opposed to holding cash.
They see it going up, and wanting to get rich quick, they buy in to it, creating a bubble.  When they see prices started to drop, they freak out and sell, and they all do it at the same time, creating a freefall.  For me, it is pretty amusing to watch them get greedy and then freak in unison.
A friend had originally introduced the whole concept of bitcoins to me some time back, and had been so good about explaining it all.  And so I've been watching them since they were at $13 - down from $25.  We both agree that they are probably going to settle under $30, but it isn't going to happen until the people who are trying to get rich quick are broke.
I am interested in bitcoins for a different reason than all of the people on here.  I am interested in them as a universal currency, in case the bottom drops out of the dollar.
I believe that in the not too distant future, that the dollar is going to hit a period of serious inflation and perhaps even hyperinflation.  But it is a tangible item, and will grow with inflation.
But right now, about the only people who are buying them are the ones that are planning on selling them for more.  I watched the same thing happen with gold in 1980, and I watched a lot of greedy speculators lose their ass.  Even as late as 2003, the price of gold was only $357, compared to the $900 oz that it was bringing in 1980.  They tried the same thing with silver about that time, and I watched it go from $5 oz to nearly $150 oz, with it selling right now for about $28/oz, and it was only about 5 years ago it was selling for $15 oz.
But it takes time for these market fluctuations to settle out.  But I've seen this happen too many times in my 50 some odd years of life to get too excited about it right now.

I had a conversation the other day, **[right here]( that kind of explains everything.
By the way, if you do get a notion to just give them away, can I suggest a beneficiary?  [There is a little gal that was hit by a car on 2/22]( and when her medicaid ran out, the hospital put her out while still in a coma. [Here is a link to the original news story](  But that little family is in a heck of a rough spot right now.  Her food stamps and WIC card were lost in the accident, so the husband can't even use them for food stuffs, and what was donated to them is being spent on rent, food, plus the medical supplies that she needs, like ensure (for the feeding tube), catheters and things of the sort.  In fact, I am going to their house tomorrow to take formula and diapers to them, and am in the process of trying to scramble to get a lawyer to work pro-bono for them, so her mom can get guardianship of her, with the help of another lady.  They don't even have a nurse going by the house to see if he is caring for her properly or not.
But in the meantime, her husband had to leave his job to take care of her, and a 1 year and 2 year old toddlers.

What do you think the normal value of a bitcoin is?  Without the spikes and craters?
And out of curiosity, what rate have you been buying at?
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:22:26
I am telling you.  I knew that the medicaid would only pay so much, but I never dreamed that any hospital would put someone out while they were in a coma.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:49:56


I am not asking you to see the future.  I am asking what *you* think the value is.  Not what it is going to be in 3-6-9 months.
Personally, I wouldn't assign a value of over $25 to one, and wouldn't give one more than that much in credit, if I were selling an item and someone wanted to pay in bitcoin.  If they wanted something I had and insisted that the value was this, that, or the other - I'd suggest they go cash some in and bring me cash.
But I am not real interested in being a part of this trading thing.

Do you mean something [like this?](
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:27:23
Oh wow.  So there is a historical trend of people going full retard at the end of school years?
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:56:33
Yep, yep, yep.  :)

By the way, I edited it just after you responded, but before I saw it.
It is still possible to make a profit using bit coins.  Nearly once a day it is dropping to the $60-80 dollar rate, and at least once a day, it is hitting over $100.  Because you *know* this fluctuation is occurring, you can use it to your advantage.  Even if you buy at $80, and it drops to $60, just sit calmly, because all of the speculators are going to run it up over $100 again in a few hours.  It is because they are all getting greedy and freaking as a single, whole herd that you can make a few bucks on it. And since these massive swings just started recently, and are caused by people who don't understand investing, it is going to keep on happening until most or all of these folks are broke.  When they no longer have the money to push the price high, it will finally stabilize.

Here is a copy of what I had responded to the OP with a second ago - 






But you made the same mistake that OP did in misunderstanding my question.  I think the only way to make it viable again for trade is for the merchants to make up their mind that they are only going to accept so much in value for them.  If someone says "they were worth $100 yesterday", to tell them to go cash them in and pay in cash.
But it would be nearly impossible to accept them at the market rate for that moment in exchange for goods.
