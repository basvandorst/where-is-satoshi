i'm a fan of BTC fixing its problems, i liked segwit 1x but that was a casualty of consensus. 
i am a proponent of software being managed correctly before anything else.

reduce transaction times and volatility no longer plays a part. 
Its only as complex as BTC wants to make it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:37:22
Its not a band aid solution, that is how systems/software is developed.
back to Amazon, in their adolescence when they hit 100k users, did they upgrade the server to 1M users? or let the system crash while someone invents a 1B users system?

BTC is making the big mistake, steam is just reacting to it. 
its nothing more than software... it can be a store of value and a currency is people want it to be

some of today's "financial planners", you're probably right. but a real broker would know exactly what they're trading with &amp; have to report accordingly. 
But the OP didn't have a broker &amp; doesn't even know what it is... this latest round of new blood coming in worries me. 
 OP; i think you made a wise move jumping into crypto! my only worry is around context
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:53:48
its nothing more than software... 
to dump all the benefits of a payment system simply because of reluctance to upgrade is insane.
As great as lighting may be, its not ready and would take a Herculean effort to implement, we have solutions available now, let use them. Again its just software, lets use a solution now to fix the problem in front of us and if in X time lighting has proven its worth, lets use that. 
As we hit 24-48 transaction times and $50 fees, we are down that road. we have hit a real problem.

Amazon deals with DOS attacks and a world of other hacks way above me on a daily basis. Their servers are set to handle FAR more than just normal usage. 
With any technology there is legitimate usage and illegitimate... Amazon doesn't close up shop on the nights they are getting attacked. 
Could you imagine what would happen to Amazon if on busy nights they charged people a fee to browse?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:40:06
You're missing the point that off chain solutions are not available. they are in the works but still need a lot of time. 
its just software, implement a solution to your problem today, and implement a solution to tomorrows problems tomorrow. Lighting sounds great, can we use it right now? no? so we just sit here and let the system get brought to its knees every few weeks, keeping our figures crossed?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:32:21
You are misinformed, there are indeed solutions actively running today in multiple coins that would solve BTC problems of today, however there are no solutions working today that would solve BTCs anticipated year 2030 problems. You have been brain washed, every product/service invented or developed would love if they could get it to the final solution today, but that's not how it works. 
I'm sure Bill Gates circa 1995 would have love windows 10 instead... its not how it works, wake up.
LN doesn't solve the problem of incentivising miners after the last coin is found any better than 8mb or 1gb blocks. again, this is a future problem that will need to be solved when the time comes with the technologies available at that time... if lighting is ready tomorrow, would you like them to hold off while the incentivising problem is solved? that's exactly what BTC is doing right now. 
My patients for BTC to implement a solution was lost about 8 months ago, the problem has been known for well over a year now and its take a level of incompetence to be standing where they are today. You're welcome to blindly follow the leaders all you want, there is massive damage being done to BTC right now and somehow they have convinced their own people that its a good thing. 
*Right now there are other coins that can do it cheaper (LTC)* This isn't a discussion between BTC and ALTs, that battle has been going on since day one, an ALT taking the value from BTC a bad thing for its investors, BCH however is owned by BTC holders as of Aug 1st. two very different battles, the only people who dont see this are the greedy people who jumped in the last few months knowing very little about the situation chasing nothing more than 1000% returns. &lt;-- am i getting close? let me guess, you're heavy into LTC as well?
We're not going to solve anything here, ill keep backing my currencies, you keep backing 1000% returns &amp; we'll see how it all shakes out. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:01
its just software... people have to accept and understand this.
there is zero reason BTC has to abandon its currency aspects because it doesn't want to upgrade. 
and if on BTC day one, people were told it was just a store of value and not a currency... we wouldn't be talking right now
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:08:18
If you rewind to the start of bitcoin and told people it would not be a currency and only a store of value, this sub, this conversations and a billion dollar network would not exist.

lol i must have missed that, &amp; i have been watching for over a year now
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:29:01
i personally think the root of the problem is a failure in the consensus model, Segwit (1 &amp; 2) paid that price. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:23:14
Sign me up... but segwit tried and failed.
you could make the argument that the consensus model is the true flaw. Regardless of what hasn't worked, we cant just sit waiting while the network is constantly hammered. 
Segwit, 2x, lightning... thumbs up from me, doing nothing is where i have a problem.
People were well aware of the congestion problem over a year ago, and i only measure via results. 1 year later, **nothing** has changed. 
the world is full of talkers
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:17:50
Segwit adoption is under 11% last i checked... 9 of 10 transaction would be non segwit regardless if they support it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:27:53
not a good analogy.
if you invested in stocks and you have no clue what that stock is, its likely because you entrust that decision/information to a broker. 
no one just goes and buys a share of Microsoft without knowing what the company is. 
Although its great to see new users enter the crytpo space, these blind dollars may end up doing more harm than good.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:09:29
i think it may fall more along the lines of a stock split... but good question
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:25:12
its important to understand, this wasn't Steams mistake.
it was the mistake of the currency making it unusable. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:04:45
ohhh no, no
the level of congestion and the "fee" you paid for your transfer will determine priority. could take as long as 1-2 days. (i haven't kept up with this backlog)
yes, you likely didn't even know there was adjustable fees... welcome to bitcoin.
I encourage you to read up on the transaction backlog and make yourself heard on the conclusion(s) you draw.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:44:52
I think they have had year(s) to do something about the transaction problems and have chosen not to, or are unable to. 
That doesn't mean we just all accept failing software that just needs updating. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:11:16
as long as new, uneducated blood enters the market... unfortunately not any time soon
the real shame is the damage blind financial support will do the BTC and crypto in general.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:03:27
im all for lightning... but the transaction problem poked it head up over a year ago... and we're working with untested RC candidates a year later? 
lightning will likely have to be implemented in another chain first (LTC?) we are months away at best &amp; i had another $42 multi hour transaction, today
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:21:23
lol good luck... there are viable ways to do so, but you wont find out in this sub
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:20:41
not saying BTC isn't more volatile, but if our concerns are about to volatile for a currency, LTC is anything but stable.

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:24:00
the money flowing in right now has absolutely no idea whats going on with transaction. they're just chasing 1000% returns. 
this will have no effect in the short term, big blow against crypto in general.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:06:05
not true... its solves exactly as many problems as the blocksize being originally set to 1MB instead of 100KB
people have to remember its nothing more than software, if lighting is ready, great, lets use it... if its not, that stinks... but we have to do something. 
seeing twitter posts about alpha tests are LN network with expectation of putting it into play on a billion dollar network is crazy.
before lightning is even considered for BTC it will have to spend time on an alt coin for heavy testing (LTC?)... we're talking months, year(s)? 
Its software, there is no need to ditch the currency aspects of bitcoin while we wait for a new technology to be invested, we have an active solution for the problem in front of us right now
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:33:19
have you actually looked into Super Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:44:26
I'm for any solution. 
Imagine if Amazon ran into capacity issues and their servers crashed during peak times.
If their approach was, i'm going to wait for a new technology that's a year + away and let the servers crash until then... i don't think we would have Amazon. 
To exaggerate the failure even more, Amazon would never let their server even get close to max capacity, they would foresee the issue and have it fixed long before. 
Why are we not seeing that same basic operational understanding from BTC?
Why are we scrambling months after $50/24h transaction to beta test solutions? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:05:04
Great to see new people seeking information before investing!
1. you don't need to worry about that, unless you have access to free electricity its unlikely you will recoup your investment in the hardware needed to mine. 
2. good question, far more bad exchanges out there than good ones. 12 months ago i would have said Kraken, 2 months ago i would have said bitfinex, 2 weeks ago i would have said bitstamp... what ever exchange you pick, get it out of there right after into a personal wallet (paper or hardware)
3. anyone who can tell you this is lying, but 2015 would have been a good time lol
4. same as any other investment... as much as you can afford to lose. 
5. i think coinbase may be your best bet. its one of the big players so less risk i guess, but you pay for that in high fees. 
good luck and welcome!

a comparison of the blockchain to TCP *sigh*... i don't think we're going to see eye to eye on this and i assure you its not through lack of knowledge. 
whatever way you want to spin it, BTC is being brought to its knees on the regular. it has now been a year since transaction backlogs have been a problem and much longer since the issue was anticipated. 
We agree there is a problem, how long is an acceptable time to wait for your R&amp;D project to solve everything? 
if we had this conversation 12 months ago when the problem was first experienced, my answer would have been 3-6 months. how much longer you willing to wait?  
I'm sure Tesla would love a battery that last 48 hours and charges in 5 min, but it doesn't exist... not sure why he would bother releasing cars... odd
Again, this isn't a debate about whats the best theoretical solution, its a debate about whats the best available option. This is operations 101, it has nothing to do with your Compsci degree (i have one 2 btw, i'm pretty sure everyone in crypto up to about 2 months ago has one). This is about a problem that arose over a year ago that still has no active solution. 
What if the decision has already been made, and high fees are their solution... 12 months and ticking. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:05:47
I have heard good things and have a few bucks invested accordingly... but for an ALT to make it to  would take a significant amount of time and failure on BTC's part. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:31:37
In 2015 when the transaction issue was acknowledged i was all in for ANY solution. I liked Segwit... 
over a year later, i see the same chain with the same problems and nothing more than talk about its solution.  
BTG, BCH, LTC, ETH, IOAT... take you pick... the crypto flag ship cant be brought to its knees on the regular, pick something, lets do it. 
Core has already killed the 2MB option, the decision has been "best of the worst" options for a little while now

This is the ~~million~~ billion dollar question right now 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:22:58
a year + later and still nothing... they have failed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:42:25
I think that's the the crux of the problem,
forget the white paper, there is a technical limitation that has been known for year(s). Segwit, lightning... how much longer do we wait? like me, alot of people don't care how the problem is solved, but its very concerning not seeing it get solved despite all the time they have had. 
Good tech companies upgrade capacity before it becomes a problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:30:50
This issue has been known for over a year now. 
congestion and high fees has occurred countless times over the last year.
Inability to implement a solution has been a problem for over a year now 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:39:59
difficult comparison to tulip mania, but i do have real concerns about BTC. i have been in crypto since the start and this is one of the first time i have seen long term movement that is unjustified by the technology. 
I think the hype wagon &amp; price has caused a lot of users to jump in that know absolutely nothing about BTC... there is a post 5 up from this one where a person is saying they invested 3 weeks ago and don't know what a bitcoin even is.
lots of ways that can go wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:53:26
forget BTC specifically... if a company waits until after volume becomes a problem to start looking for solutions, they have already failed. 
Imagine if Amazon didn't upgrade their servers until after they crashed a few times.

they are paid to control the narrative, nothing else
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:47
the very rigidity that kept SW2X away is whats keeping a solution from being implemented today. *double edged sword*
Seeing where the price is today, this is a difficult point to make... but BTC is lower than i could be had it not had these transaction problems. Where we are with lightning right now, is where we should have been this time last year when congestion issues were brought up.
Lightning is going to have to spend some time on an ALT coin before being implemented into BTC... probably LTC, but no matter if you call it an Alpha, Beta, or RC, its not happening any time soon and more money will be lost for BTC investors as a result. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:40:48
its speculation at best linking block size and security.
BCH has 8MB right now and is generally hated by a large community... I don't see any problem being reported?  If it could be done, it would be done. 
The best point in that entire pdf:
*Higher fees resulting from keeping the block size limit low may help develop a transaction fees market*
There was not risk to segwit, there is no risk to 2,4, or 8MB... yet nothing is done
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:32:00
you have to put your shelf in the shoes of Steam.
Is that a good customer experience? look at how much less adopted AMEX is as a result of its higher fees, nvm transaction times.

I believe the short sighted decision was that of BTC to talk over a year to solve the transaction problem
...  a year and counting. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:07:02
i was using amazon as a very simple example to show how nonsensical the approach BTC has taken to their software limitation is.
also, keep in mind, your "band aid" was theoretically baked in from 100k-200k... 500k-1MB, no issues using it there. 
its just software, apply you "band aid" now and your "real solution" when ready. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:24:52
up for debate, but better than doing nothing
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:16:20
fees to the level we're seeing now were never "as designed". if you told people on day one bitcoin is not a currency and just a store of value, none of us would be here. 
having scaling issues because your so popular is a very good place to be... bitcoin is not the first technology to have this problem. The only way to screw this up, is by doing nothing. 
as much as i love hearing about the potential of segwit, lighting... results are all that matter.
if Amazon charged users to browse during peek usage, do you think they would be where they are today?
Its nothing more than software, no software last forever... i understand there are consensus blockers with applying a fix (the true root of the problem), but time will run out eventually. 
There is a sea of software up to the task of being a currency and a store of value, this isn't the philosophical decision people want it to be... its a software upgrade.
there is enough money flowing through Bitcoin to put the Architects &amp; Engineers at the high bar tech companies operate at. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:35:24
not that i know of... and i personally see that as a problem 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:57:47


We are talking billions of dollars and the problem has been known for well over a year now... Hopefully is an embarrassment. 
Any other technical platform run in this way wouldn't be worth the silicone its using. 
If Amazon waited for its server to come crashing down from volume before upgrading, you think they would be where they are today?
a tech company that has capacity issues is a great place to be! a tech company that then does nothing about those issues is nothing
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:27:06
the world does far more hand holding than that... Steam is just protecting their customers. 
*People were sending money that by the time it arrived (due to price dropping) wasn't worth enough in USD for the game they were purchasing, so had to send another small payment to make up the difference (plus another high fee). That is a nonsensical system for Steam to implement.*
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:21:11


you heard it hear first folks! lol
people are underestimating what it would take to get lighting to run across the entire network 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:09
Amazon was an example to reflect operations of just about any tech stack. there is no such things as waiting for R&amp;D to conclude while active solutions exist today that could solve the problem... it has already been a year.
There is no model where transaction fees will incentivise miners to the level of mining today once the last block has been discovered. I'll acknowledge that's an issue, but fees would have to be at an unusable level if they were to act as the sole source of income to miners. A problem for BTC year 2030 to solve, something that segwit, lighting &amp; block size will not solve...meaning, its just software and will always need updating.
BTC was never just a store of value, and because of the transaction problems it now has to take that stance, we saw Steam ditch them, that's all lost value that will continue leave BTC. Dont forget, if we were talking back in ~2012 and the message back then was BTC is only a store of value and not a currency, we would not be talking right now. Im not saying it is, but in its current state its comparable to a ponzi scheme, not sure how that doesn't raise alarms. 
The Tesla example was to show the stupidity of BTC's current "wait for R&amp;D model". A perfect solution does not exist today, (like Tesla and his battery limitations). There is no perfect solution, but we have answers that can solve the problem(s) while perfect solutions are invented/discovered.

This is a failure in the currency, not Steam
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:24:39
I'm not commenting on Amazon as a company, just as an example of operations of a technical space/product.
decentralization doesn't come at the cost of quality. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:50:50
i'm not saying 1GB... im saying implement a solution that you know works (right now) and implement the better solution when its available. it makes no sense to sit on our hands while the network gets pummeled. there is no need, its just software. although 1GB would, 2,4,8MB does not lead to decentralization. 
forget Amazon, lets use a data center as an example.
your XXX Petabyte data center is out of hard drive space, your blades all have 5TB drives in them. do you upgrade to 10TB drives that exist today and let your data center keep growing or do you let it max out for months/years and wait for the 50TB drives being researched?
We're not picking the best option, we're picking the best of the available options. This is the position every successful tech stack is faced with, how BTC is handling this is nonsense.

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:52:08
i don't agree, but i'll give it to you... *Scaling must be done very carefully*
It has been known for over a year that the 1MB block size would reach max.
my beef at this point is entrusting a group/company/people with running a tech stack they have no business running. 
You think Amazon lets it server crash from volume before upgrading? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:53:48

i understand and agree with Steams move, they dont care about what form of money people use, as long as its a pleasant experience. 
BTC with variable fees and confirmation times does not make for a pleasant purcahse experience.

@_date: 2017-12-07 03:40:43
I'll shed a tear for segwit, it does indeed seem to fix the issue... but it failed on the political side of things. 
again, i think the consensus model is really what failed it. efforts have been made for the past 3 months to gain adoption. we're still only @ 11% and that's not trending up. 
regardless of how we ended up where we are; whats the best of our worst options now? i vote for that (real options, not untested beta code that's miles away)
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:20:52
perhaps a dropped transaction? welcome to BTC
you're not supposed to move it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:32
Think of any other tech product/company.
if it was run with that mentality... it would not exist. 
it would be akin to Amazon upgrading its server after they have crashed on a regular basis from volume. Not saying companies don't operate like that, just not the good ones.

I personally think the US government will do exactly that once crypto solves security issues for them.
if my "grandmother" held crypto with her technical knowledge it would be stolen in a matter of minutes. the "masses" are not technical inclined enough to use/hold bitcoin. Heck, you can read about the theft from technically inclined folks today. 
In my mind that absolute nature of bitcoin is what will prevent it from going mainstream. if everyone had bitcoin on their phone, "hacker" would be the best paid profession in the world.
the US gov't cant operate under that absolute model, and they couldn't possibly cover the theft costs that would accompany such a coin. Crypto will eventually solves this, once they do i think bitcoin will be at risk.

And then get two of your friends/family to sign up, if they sign up two of their friends! MOON!

There is no evidence to support that. 2-4-8MB block size is not a solution for world adoption, but it will solve the transaction problem for the foreseeable future, perhaps then lightning will be sufficiently developed and tested to be put into a billion dollar network. 
To just let your current network get brought to its knees while we cross our fingers on an untested technology is crazy... and there is no need.
its software, nothing more.

right now, technical complexity... Its not a reach to assume everyone involved in crypto right now is more technically savvy on average.
long term, we have to figure out a way to enable reversibility without a governing body... long road ahead

I'm not saying its a big situation, or one that needs to be worried about.

After reading this i'm not sure if the author fully understands the situation.
