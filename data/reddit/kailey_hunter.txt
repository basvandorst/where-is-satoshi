They've been doing the same on LTC for a while too.

I mean set stop losses and protect your profts. Nothing wrong with selling and buying back lower. Just depends if you want more crypto or more fiat in the end

The amount of fud surrounding bitcoin has been super high recently, so I'm expecting a huge pump soon.

Makes sense. Invest in something that just pumped a ton in one week and then invest in an ICO that l is no different than any ICO, highly speculative and will take 5 years to show any type of fruition. Aka what we recently saw with Tron from .30 to .07 in a week. People lost a lot more than $10k. 
I got a 15x return on my investment this year from trading between btc and ltc alone. And that's because they are the only two I believe in and am willing to invest.
But good luck. Take some time to let the ego cool down before it gets ahead of you.

I agree with everything you said

It's easy to ride the highs, but one day you'll make a bad trade, go on tilt trying to get the money you lost, then it's all gone, and you take out a loan to get it back...

The fear of Tether has probably crashed the price more than USDT has pumped it up past natural growth.
