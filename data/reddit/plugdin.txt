Thank you so much, that means a lot!
I am planning on releasing a set of prints and most likely auctioning off the original if you’re interested.

Nah , I could care less about the guy , just making an observation that if you repeatedly spout the same nonsense over and over some people will jump on board
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:29:34
You got it! Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:47:22
I personally can’t stand politics , I think it’s all corrupt . But can I ask you an honest question ? Do you really think he is a good president or do you think he is the best of the 2 choices ? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:36:29
Ehh he had a couple of rough years. Doing pretty well right now though
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:03:30
I’ll keep my reply brief as well , you are correct this isn’t the place for it . My life was good before him , my life is good with him and I’m assuming my life will be good after him.  The only real problem I have with him and his followers is the 4th grade level arguing , trash talking and finger pointing . It’s almost cult like, which is similar to the way btc has been acting  . I’ve found the key to life is only worry about what you can control , if it doesn’t affect you then don’t waste any energy on something that you can’t control.  Sometimes I need to remind myself of that again. 
No hard feelings , hope to see you someday racing lambos on the moon with me. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:08:28
Awesome ! Thanks again!
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:02:41
I wonder how much that cost? Those clowns have the exact same tactics as the_donald .
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:19:38
Ok guys! I got the prints in and the look amazing! 
Pretty sure I got private messages out to everyone who was interested. Thanks again all!!
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:08:36
Awesome! Thank you
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:45:21
Thank you! The original is 36”x36” , I was thinking of making the prints 24x24”.. would that work for you?
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:24:04
Of course and thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:01:39
Scanning is the absolute best method true but a scanner that can handle this size is rare and expensive.
Professional digital photos for large paintings is what’s used most often 
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:50:58
Thank you ! Prints will be made soon, I will make sure to let you know
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:36:03
You’re good!
