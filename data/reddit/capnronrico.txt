Is this some type of illogical football tribalism being exhibited here? Or is it just a terrible example of someone gate keeping in an attempt to enlarge their ego and improve a low level of self esteem?

Hey mate, yes it is hard these days with no real home for us. The glory days are behind us now.
The authorities seem to be spending a lot of time focusing on the darknet &amp; it saddens me a great deal meanwhile kiddy fiddlers and unhinged violent scumbags seem to be lower in priority than those who want to consume whatever they like via the pillars of mind altering substances and bitcoin.

Perhaps because the experience of buying btc is shit.I went to use one of those ATM machines and the thing practically tried to give me a proctology exam. Actually I am pretty sure a discrete mechanical arm came out of it and brushed up against my nads, probably to get a DNA swab for all I know.
 For something that is supposed to rival cash, it is pretty inconvenient. thankfully I had a photo of my passport and it was accepted.
I did want the money fast and yet it was 3 hours of waiting to be verified - no wonder people do not use it to spend.

That is because you do not comprehend the topic being discussed, you are stuck at trying to figure out what a plant and a bitcoing have in common when they are quite obviously linked when the topic is understood.

You are welcome - Yes it is true, from my first purchase many years ago as well as my first failed attempt to buy $500 at 18cents each, I am one of the pillars of this community. You should all look away as you are not worthy.  
I encourage you all to revere me in muted tones and perhaps do a little whip around to ensure I can continue to get those small sweet tidy packages of white powder, brown powder, the occasional tabs and lets not forget the magnificence of the crystals.
Now please, continue and try not to degenerate into a group of seagulls fighting over a chip.

Why, they both relied on pure luck each time.
Seems to me you would be better off following a football team than putting all your allegiance into some abstract technology that may or may not die out.
The moment you become emotional over an investment is the moment you handicap yourself.

Fortune Jack, Bitstarz &amp; King Billy are my preferred online venues although my biggest win from $1 was over $8000 a couple months ago on Joe Fortune. I sometimes go on Fairgo, perhaps I am starting to develop a problem. Still, no dependants &amp; only me to look after &amp; it keeps me entertained.
Of course I fell into the trap of thinking "Well if I won 8K with $1 imagine what I can do if I invest the $8k back into it"
I lost the lot before the weekend was over, ironically making me feel the same way many here are at the moment.

Drug dealers and drug buyers are among the many that would like a currency that does not fluctuate like a damn roller coaster.
I take out enough for all the chaps for a weekend of debauchery &amp; then the damn price moves and its only enough to make it to Sunday morning.

In the end, we believe what we want to believe.
If you do not see the comparisons then it is because you are biased and not open to criticism of btc.
Deceive others at will, I have no problem with it, I occasionally do it myself but its best not to self deceive.

No, the mania is only the last few years, it was below $600 for at least 8 years of that 10 years and then everyone wanted a piece without the first clue as to what it was. Some got rich, not because they were smart but because of timing and luck and some intellect but more on the luck.
I have talked about bitcoin since 2011 when I tried buying some to get some um er supplies when in NYC of silk road. $500 worth I guess it was about 18 cents.
Up until the last year, I never met anyone who knew what it was then overnight everyone was an expert.
Now I do not pretend to know a huge amount about it but about 95% of the gurus know less than I do. Nobody knows which way the price will go &amp; the price is driven by nothing that btc actually provides, it is nearly all speculative.  
hence the comparison to tulips.  
It is compared to them because no other item I would guess in human history can compare to the stratospheric rise in value all the way from what 10 cents to 20,000 at its height.  
Does anything other than the tulip crash come anywhere near as close to that in terms of price increase over such a short time? No nothing does and that is why it is compared to it.

The thing is I have had in the last year 3 wins over 3k about 10 over 1k
I got up to 5k once from $20 deposit &amp; I am not a new player when I won most of those.
I think it truly is random at least with the more reputable casinos although the more you play the sooner it becomes inevitable that you lose overall.
When you think about it, that is the most addictive  setup.  I have some nights where I legit cannot lose &amp; that is across different casinos.
I cannot tell you the amount  of times that I have put $20 in &amp; got it over $600.
Still I have only ever cashed out once &amp; that was with mucho Vegas for about 2k.
I only ever play slots &amp; 100% you will lose with them over time but yet I still do.
Most I will spend in a month is $300 of my own money. The issue when you win online is it's hard to see the value of what you have won.
I look at 8K  &amp; think what a moron for not cashing out.

I spent 2 hours in a hotel in NYC trying to buy $500 worth of btc at 11 cents each.
My visa card would not allow the transaction no matter what I did so I gave up and found some Russian college kid who I met at hotel bar which was midway between 80th avenue and times square on the west side. I seem to remember a red lighted sign and perhaps it was called the union hotel.
I ended up with these things called moon rocks which to this day was the best experience I have ever had before or since. No medicinal substance has ever approached how good they were.
I was with my then wife so being responsible I tested it out (without her knowing) just before we went to see the lion king.
I dislike plays and that sort of thing. This stuff kicked in on our walk to the theatre and oh my, we got in and when the music came on and those giraffe came out - the best moment of my life and I still get hair standing up thinking about it.
I could not contain my excitement &amp; kept tapping my wife on the hand saying how awesome it was.
When we got out she said "you have taken something haven't you" 
Never touched drugs during our time together until then which must have been at least 12 years at that point.
The following night she had some and it was equally as much fun.
Anyway, even if I had have purchased my goods off of the silk road had visa allowed the transaction, even the pocket change left over, even if it was only $30 or so, it would have been life changing amounts.
This is all assuming I had not spent every cent of course but still, it is a regret that I have being I knew what btc was and what it was used for back in 2011.
No item in the history of mankind (as far as I am aware) has been so readily available &amp; increased from its initial value so much as btc has.
I do not believe there will be anything in future that will come close to the magnitude of the rise or the relative speed that it rose. We missed the boat:(
Some though, some are sailing around in their big yachts and have garages full of exotic cars, just nobody reading this post.
Lucky buggers.

It makes me laugh that people think that crypto will not be likely the most regulated form of currency in existence simply for the fact it is so easy to track.
It reminds me so much of the time media corporations were having a heart attack over the internet and how their whole industry was going to collapse until someone said..........
"Hey this is a long shot but why don't we just charge for advertising on the internet?"
Its the same thing, it will be regulated &amp; the purveyors of shady substances such as myself will have to find a currency that does not attract the sort of attention btc does.
Still given 10 years &amp; I think they will lock it down so tight that no type of crypto currency will fly under the radar.

From someone that does not really understand or have allegiance for anyone, I think he won by a fair margin.
I will tell you why &amp; this is someone who cares little about who is right or wrong and what they have done on either side.
1) All callers were extremely negative towards him and used polarizing words that showed their extreme dislike for him personally - that indicates heavy biase and potential collusion, their opinions should be ignored.
2) They attacked the man personally 100% of the time, not a single relevant fact on why their strategy was a better way to go
3) Dragging up crimes that are not relevant, were a long time ago while having the luxury of remaining anonymous so their wrong doings can be compared.
4) Making baseless accusations where they obviously have no proof. They accused him of manipulating the market yet when he denied it, they did not offer any evidence to demonstrate he was lying, meaning at best they were guessing.
Now he was not brilliant himself. Instead of being dragged down by muck raking which was the intention of the callers, he started defending their claims when he should have dismissed them and remained on topic.
One thing he kept saying which was a good thing, the information out there is obvious as to who is the group that want to dictate and rule things.
It is good because for the people like me that are interested, we will quickly figure out how true these claims are and make up our own minds.
In summary, people that attack others personally in a debate because they have no proper counterpoints should shampoo my crotch. It removes the ability for an interaction like this to be worthwhile for those watching and just wastes everyones time. 
If the dude touched up a bunch of 8 year olds then perhaps that is relevant but selling explosives online, IDGAF.

7 btc is a strong incentive to shaft you.
The only time I would loan that sort of money out is if I knew aomeone who was a bit better at pursuading him to return it &amp; was not afraid to use tactics that I would be unable to.

I must have missed hoverboards and flying cars on my daily walks. There was a statement said in I think it was the  big short that said we overestimate good news and under estimate bad news or the likelyhood of bad things occurring.  
That is related and sort of opposite of what is said here and I believe that is more accurate than this.

Even at that price, it is probably one of if not the greatest performing asset in the history of the human race. Can you think of any other asset that has increased % wise from about 8 cents to $3500 in less than 10 years?

without understanding all factors or even the primary factors that goes into valuing something then I agree and I agree for both ways, there is no way to value it at that level, above that level or below that level without assigning the reason for each factor that creates that value.
I think a large part of it is &amp; will be unknown &amp; impossible to ever quantify. I mean I had a strong feeling that at 20K &amp; every second person asking me how to buy BTC while the month prior not even knowing its existence were key indicators that the price was an absurdity designated by the clueless majority.  
Still that clueless majority dictated the price for a while because they were prepared to pay those amounts even though it was not based on any rational decisions.
Is the current price a realistic and correct value? I do not know enough but it is certainly closer because so many of the really clueless investors have been burnt and will not enter the market again.
Personally $60 up to $600 has a nice ring to it, I think that it will never be a primary tool for transactions as it is too slow plus there is very little friction for anyone creating competing block chains only doing it better than BTC has done.
I think there will for a long time there will be demand for it as long as they do not tighten the regulation to a point that the darknet and criminal organisations cannot use it effectively. If that happens and it is impossible to use without being tracked to an identity then the one safeguard that stops it dropping to zero is lost.
Of course I would well be wrong. Ultimately it might be a simple idea but people seem unable to get the fact that something is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Remove the demand from the darknet and suddenly there are not too many people seeing real value in BTC and they are not prepared to pay what they used to.
There are a million variables of course &amp; I doubt many people know where it is going with much certainty.
