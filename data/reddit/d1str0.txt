Could be a glitch. GDAX is experiencing some weird glitches on BCH/BTC exchange.
It might be rolling out still. It might not be immediate for ALL accounts.

Doesn't square now allow BTC transactions?

That's cool. Didn't know about the extra $1. I got my 10 as soon as I verified my email. It was practically instant.

Well, Portland State (pdx.edu) works. Good to note though. Thanks.

I believe it is for every time the ad is loaded.
iAds has been phased out:

For sure. Not much data yet, but here's what I've earned so far:
With 492 impressions, I've earned $2.01
An impression is an app load AFAIK. So right now my impressions are quite low but I'm expecting this article to pick that up a bit. But yeah, $2/500 impressions ish.

Coinbase has worked well for me. They're insured and US based so I trust them more so than other options. 
Also you have the option of selling for cash in person.

I use Craigslist

Don't invest more than you're safely willing to lose. Don't stretch yourself if you're not comfortable losing it all.

My point was you have to be psychic to game the market. DCA or just buy and hold 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:12:41
Well it could go lower...
But it could also go higher...

Just them? So do you normally trust randoms on the internet for financial advice, but these guys you don't?
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:25:52
Yeah, but if you're in the US you will get your money back. If it was Bitcoin you'd be screwed.

You make it sound like there is no such thing as malware. A private key is not hard to find on a system if you get infected.

Seriously. Coinbase is at 1989

Buy a set dollar amount at a set interval. Only invest what you can afford to lose if it happened to crash badly. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:34:32
Coinbase is insured and also offers cold storage. I'd recommend them. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:15:58
Just make sure don't invest what you don't mind losing. No sign of catastrophic crash but there's literally nothing tangible backing it up. I personally invest but again, nothing more than what I would be okay losing if we go tits up. Good luck!
