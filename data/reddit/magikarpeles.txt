Well I think it goes without saying that most bitcoin blogs and news sites, the owners have a vested interest in bitcoin doing well and being portrayed positively. There is a huge conflict of interest. That's why I don't find them informative at all, because they don't represent the broader public's opinions, just their own vested interests. I can just look at for that.

Bad news for the govt because now they have to actually pay the debt they incurred instead of reducing the value through inflation.

Governments love inflation.
- More exports as it's cheaper for other countries to buy from them
- Their debts to overseas creditors are worth less
- They can tax their citizens more (payrises to keep up with inflation = higher tax rates)
It's win win win with inflation! (Or, lose lose lose if you are the population - higher cost of living, no minimum wage increases to keep up with inflation, lower purchasing power overseas, higher tax rates).

Edit: You people need to remember these services are not charities. If you think you can provide the service for cheaper (which includes convincing these vendors to use your service instead of other services), then by all means start your competing company. Competition is good for everyone.
Price gouging is very characteristic from any business with an early-mover advantage. This won't change until someone else does it better (which they certainly will).
Yes, they could just accept bitcoin directly, but that involves more work for them to turn it into fiat - which they currently pretty much have to.

I'm not disagreeing with you, being an entrepreneur is hard. But the eventual payoff can be astronomical, which is why so many people choose to do it.
But the point that Wilson is making is that he believes that developers will now see that their time and effort is better spent working on bitcoin and bitcoin-related ventures, rather than working on bitcoin analogues.

Not even close. 46 million addresses where 45 million have less than 0.001 BTC in them (which I would not consider a "user"). Leaves ~2 million addresses. This excludes offchain users, but includes people with multiple wallets like me (I control at least 20, mostly with less than a coin each but more than 0.001).

@_date: 2015-01-05 00:11:38
This isn't saying anything about a conspiracy (at least the top comment isn't). A strong currency is not good for a government, so this is not good news for the US fed. The higher it climbs, the more the US economy suffers in terms of exports and the higher the notional value of their foreign debt.
Cheaper imports lowers the cost of goods, so the fed collects less tax. Improved purchasing power lowers the need for individual payrises which again hurts the fed at tax time.
The high value of the USD is certainly not a sign of health (at least from the Fed's perspective). Coupled with $9 trillion in USD short positions, if it keeps going parabolic for too long there will be some serious fall out.

my point is this seems like something only a coding community can make use of. If you can't code, then fuck you, no trustless systems for you, because you still have to trust someone who can code (so, it's not trustless).
And every time you want to use something you have to audit the entire code to make sure there's nothing nefarious in there? Doesn't seem practical to me.
