The people you are talking about gained their reputations by making good changes that got adopted. None of them think what you are purposing is a good idea. So you can either realize you disagree with the experts and examine your own thought process and see where you went wrong or submit a competing change if you really think you are right.

Yes it does.. it has to use enough energy to make it improbable that anyone could control a large portion of it and eventually that electricity will have to be bought and paid for by fees.

Yep long term believer and I would go down with the ship if it came to it. I bet that we will see users coming up with good use cases to take advantage of the lower fees. I myself used to play black jack with Bitcoin and got priced out by the fees I might get to do it again for awhile.

She is the CEO of Lightning Labs one of the most prominent organizations pushing the lightning network forward. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:46:40
That was my assumption too. Sounds like a business model if no one finds a way to do it atomically. Building a reputation of balancing channels without stealing funds. You would only ever have the chance of stealing like an hour's worth of funds at a time. Schnoor signatures would help out a lot on fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:33:19
Don't forget that fees are directly responsible for securing the network. The miner subsidy won't be there forever. If it's not worth paying for it won't survive.

You don't have to accept a request to route a payment if you don't want to. If you don't like the way a transaction will leave your channels you can decline and let them find another route. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:03:04
Yes everyone using lighting needs a channel. In the best case scenario you will have one channel open. You will use this one channel to send and receive money from any one on the the lightning network. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:14:00
Nope. I am huge supporter of bitcoin but it will not be a good currency for years and years. Mainly because the price will be rocketing upwords until it hits something approximating full adoption. Along the way we will have tons of confidence crises and price dips and that's fine. 
Bitcoin will not be built in a day. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:37:46
There are like 15 nodes on mainnet. The lightning developers were poking fun at them this morning on Twitter. Saying they were just asking to lose money to a bug in their beta software. I for one am glad to see the inthusiasm and initiative.

If you don't like how it's being done you are more than welcome to submit your own code changes. The reason the experts haven't implement big blocks is because it would be very difficult to coordinate and help very little. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:34:33
I hope this is the reason but we don't know that. No sign coinbase had begun batching and they definitely are not using segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:06:19
Each hop has the option of charging a fee. If the fee to use a certain route is 2 high you can search for a different route. Who you should open a channel with is a bit up in the air right now. A well connected node like coinbase would be a good option but also anyone with a well funded channel to a very connected node would work 2 if you didn't want to connect directly to a large node.

Using a transaction accelerator won't be a double spend it is just bribing a miner to include your original transaction.  
Most wallets won't let you spend coins that are part of a pending transaction. You technically can but it will be a double spend and some/most miners will ignore it. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:36:37

I actually agree with you people are a bit to cautious about this especially online. Bitcoin is a bit different than most assets though. If someone steals your car it can be tracked.  If someone hacks your bank website transactions can be reversed. Bitcoin can be used relatively anoymously there is little recourse once it's stolen.

You can't just monitor the transaction because when you tried to close the channel the other person could try to race you by spending a higher fee to move the money before you can. The setup process of a channel involves time locking the money so at the other end of the channel you know they cannot try to race you when you close the channel.

If you want the best security option consider buying a Trezzor. If you dont want to spend money Airbitz is a great option very secure and they have online backup.

Purse.io is a favorite of many bitcoiners. It is a tool that helps match people with amazon gift cards with people who want to buy things with bitcoin. Bitcoin is arguably a better form of money then amazon giftcards so you get a premium for your bitcoin. It might take you a few minutes to learn how the site works but its worth it. You can easily get 20% or more off of anything on amazon. 
There is another app that works similarly for starbucks (20% off) and target (3% off) called foldapp. The easiest way to use this one is to download and use the Airbitz wallet its built right in. 
cardcash.com will accept bitcoin and give you an additional 2% discount for using bitcoin to purchase already discounted gift cards.
Other then that dell, overstock, expedia and many others except them directly.
Google around and see if any local shops are accepting bitcoin and go out and support them around me there are 4 restaurants and a bar. 
Dont forget to buy twice as many bitcoin as you spend to keep growing your bitcoin holdings happy spending.
@_date: 2018-09-30 22:43:42
Your correct on a few things. They don't have custody of your money and they don't have your private key. You do however have to give them a copy of the state that they should enforce if the counter party tries to cheat. Most people know that if you attempt to cheat whith lightning you lose all your funds in the channel. Well a watchtower can make it look like you cheated anytime it wants simply by brodcasting an old state. So yeah they can't take your money but they can give it all to your counter party.

Hey, 
This is a great answer just wanted to also add that if you interested in a service where you have an account attached to your email address they exist. These services are bit more user friendly but the trade off is that someone else has access to your bitcoins besides you. A few examples are Coinbase and Circle. Airbitz is my favorite as its kind of the best of both worlds. It has an account so you can always access your funds if you lose your device but the only thing airbitz hangs on is encrypted files that you encrypt on your device before you send it on to them so they cant access your funds.

No we are not there yet. But there are promising things on the horizon. Particularly Schnorr signatures for aggregating signatures and reducing transaction size by a ton. There are also other proposals I'm less familiar with that I thought sounded promising but even all put together I think there are still innovations needed if we want to scale bitcoin and keep it trustless. It's not binary though. As bitcoin improves it grabs more and more use cases it will probably still be awhile before it gobbles up the use case of first world coffee purchase though.

@_date: 2018-05-04 17:30:34
No your right. 20 percent is the enthusiasts discount for sure. 3-8% is much more plausible depending on how many charge backs your buisness deals with. I highly doubt your payments are settled on the day though. You have never had a charge back past a day? 
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:16:49

What's a Diplo?
@_date: 2018-05-04 19:11:29
Yeah it is defiantly an enthusiasts discount. 3% is about right but the other part of this is that charge backs are very expensive for companies accepting credit cards. Charge backs are impossible with bitcoin so if you have a business that is eating a lot of charge backs you could see a discount of 8-10% making sense. I don't think dentists get a lot of that though. The dentist is just trying to encourage people to join the bitcoin economy.

You can get a 2k Fiat limit without photo copying anything that will be pleanty. 
Thanks I went through Kraken's sign up and verify in English. Requires a photo copy of id and proof of residence. I dont remember having to do that for Coinbase Or Circle. Any one know of something more along those lines? 
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:27:41
Listen to this guy^ your going to want to use localbitcoins. It’s defiantly possible to raise your limit’s but you do that by providing more detailed personal information so that they can be sure your not doing anything illegal. Localbitcoins will keep you nice and anoyomous with no limits. Downside is you will pay a bit of a premium for the anonymity.
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:09:55

I personally think Bitcoin will ultimately be successful. My biggest fear is that governments and people in control of the current financial system will try to ban and squash bitcoin. I don’t think they will be able to though they will find it as hard or harder then it has been to stop people from using bittorrent.  For every one person fighting for the old system there will be ten more that the old system is a disadvantage for and will be fighting for the new one. I know its really tin foil hat but i honestly do believe its a good idea to hold some bitcoin in secret because of this. I for one don’t think I could stand up to the government if they knocked on my door and demanded I give them all my bitcoin. To be clear I do think its more likely that governments will see the advantages and how hard it will be to stop and just support bitcoin but why not be safe? I’m not really very afraid bitcoin will get passed by a competitor bitcoin is still rapidly innovating and as far as i can tell its drawing the lions' share of developers but i do keep an eye out for anything that looks promising. I do put my money where my mouth is and I hold around 25% of my wealth in bitcoin and I’m tempted to shift more money there.
All of that is just the potential as a monetary system. On top of that Bitcoin as a immutable ledger has so many other applications and potential to disrupt so many other industries. I stole this from someone else but i love it. Investing in Bitcoin is a risk but its the most beautiful risk ill ever take.
@_date: 2016-01-02 06:42:25

1. I spend bitcoins whenever I can. I think of it as trying to signal to the people I transact with that its my preferred method of payment. Plus with Purse, Cardcash, Foldapp, I usually find a way to get a discount for using bitcoin. Then I always buy twice as much bitcoin as I spend right after I spend it.
2. Over my head
3. I have heard this as well and I admit logically it does seem to make sense but surely storing your value in something that is deprecating is far crazier.

Not to sound like a jerk but you obviously have access to the internet. Get to reading. I believe in this technology and its power to change the world for the better and in doing so greatly increase in value. That being said there are things to worry about that you should understand before you invest any more money then you would be upset about losing at a casino. The bitcoin network could be hacked (unlikely but you should know why), Governments could band together and decide to ban bitcoin, someone could come up with a better version of bitcoin. You will find a lot of people that are willing to talk bitcoin with you all day here including me :) happy to answer any questions but thats not any substitute for doing your own due diligence. If i were you I would buy one bitcoin as soon as possible or whatever you deem as an acceptable amount and then hit the books and learn as much as you can before investing.

Bitcoin remittance isn't cheaper then the standard systems because the money conversion on either side is so costly but all it would take is a grocery store near your family that would accept bitcoin. That would cut the cost in half. Find a job that pays in bitcoin and its eliminated. Finding the job seems a bit harder but its so solvable. Charging poor people a percentage on there money in the era of the internet just seems criminal to me.

Im a 26 year old white male with libertarian leanings pretty much what you would expect. I believe in bitcoin because of the technology that eliminates the middlemen and because it allows people to side step the central planning and inflation of the government. 
I spend bitcoin wherever I can. Purse.io and cardcash get most of my bitcoin because i can get just about anything at a discount. I also spend it at the few restaurants around town that accept it.

Not exactly one of the qwerks of the way Bitcoin avoids having a central authority is that transaction take a bit of time. In general Bitcoin transactions take about 10 mins if you pay a competitive fee. 
You are not wrong if you think that sounds kind of lame. Very bright people are working on ways to make payments cheap and instant over Bitcoin. Those projects are actually very close to alpha releases.

Cardcash.com it's a marketplace for buying and selling gift cards. The cards sell at a discount and if you buy with bitcoin you get another 2% off. I recommend sticking to the digital cards they arrive in like 5 mins and it's much easier for cardcash to protect you from scammers. Either way they garentee the cards. The only time I had trouble was with a physical card and they refunded me with no hassle.

@_date: 2018-10-17 01:31:39
It does seem like that would be better. It ends up reducing the security of Bitcoin though. Bitcoin security works on staking resources like electricity and minning hardware. If you try to cheat as a minner these resources will be wasted so you are incentivized to not try to cheat the system. If you can turn around and use those resources for something else it ruins that incentive system.

Related to the price popping? I have been really curious to see if segwit adoption would have an effect on the price when and if we saw more hashing power start to signal it.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:07:12
Might as well be. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:04:39
Bitcoin is still being built and we don't know what if anything it will be good for yet. So it's really hard to value it. Someday everything will solidify and the price will stablize and then we can talk about using it as a currency. 
That being said I spend bitcoin all the time. I don't do it because it's a good idea though I do it for ideological reasons.

I agree to a point, but there is a large difference between a contentious hardfork with and without replay protection. I think that bitcoin will survive that aswell but i'll be glad when it has proven me right.

A crappy trusted implementation is possible now and is what Bitcoin Lightning Wallet on android is currently doing. There are ideas for a more trust less implementation but it requires a softfork. I don't think anyone could accurately predict when and if that will happen. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:05:45
I had a very similar experience. I used green wallet first and it defaults to RBF. I successfully used copay a few days after that. Does samurai not have an option to turnoff RBF? Greenwallet did at the time. This was around a year ago.

I would agree. I also think this makes it an easier fight for the people who support the core scaling roadmap. With the big blockers are dividing their support and resources between 2 different forks.

Maybe. But the amount of the payment does not matter it's the size of the transaction that matters. A 17 cent payment with 5 inputs will be bigger than a million dollar transaction with 1 input.

I am not. I don't wish fire and brimstone on the people who do but I don't agree with them. No one has made the case to me that a 2x right now is needed. A blocksize increase eventually sure but hopefully one that will be future proof instead of kicking the can down the road. It doesn't matter how important a constituency is in bitcoin. If they can't make the case for there ideas then they should not be listened to.

He means there would not be enough buyers to buy all the coins you wanted to sell and the price would have to come down to entice more buyers. He is right that it could happen but it would take alot more money than 500 btc to do it.

Welcome. Put twice as much emphasis on learning as you do buying :) 
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:17:15
Yeah unfortunately you are going to see a delay on that one. If you want there are some options but they are more expecive than your entire transaction so I doubt that's what you want to do. Your transaction will likely be mined in the future on like a Sunday night when there are few transactions waiting to be confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:02:39
Sounds like you have the right idea. Be cautious and put twice as much emphasis on learning as investing.

Typically when I spend bitcoin I get a bigger discount than the fees I pay on Gemini to buy it back. Takes very little time 4 clicks max and my price is guaranteed even though I can't withdrawal until the bank transfer clears.

Yes probably, as is the right of anyone in the bitcoin community. Just follow the fork you think creates the best system and if you are not sure keep both sides of the fork. It's not really something to be afraid of.

@_date: 2017-08-13 16:02:50
I think the best advice is to take a bit of money from a bad habit smoking, drinking, fast food, etcetera and buy bitcoin with that every week or so. Then you can have fun watching it go up and down with the rest of us and maybe you will be motivated enough to learn more about it. Then raise or lower your weekly buy depending on if you think the system is valuable or not.

I ran into a cash-strapped situation in Japan. As a bitcoin fanatic, I walked right up to the nearest bank ATM and used my bank card to withdraw some money. I technically could have found a BTM but it's just not at all the most convenient or probably even the cheapest option and I hope it never is. Best case scenario you just spend your bitcoin at local merchants.

Your mnumonic phrase is your private key. There are probably apps out there to convert it to the raw decimal values but there is no need and it would be dangerous because 99% of those apps are probably there just to steal your private keys. 
Your pin locks your trezor. So if someone gets your seed they can import it in to any wallet and won't need or care about your pin. 
But if you use a passphrase and they steal your seed all they will see is an empty wallet unless they know you have a passphrase and know what if is.

@_date: 2018-10-16 14:08:12
It's dumb but it is RBF. I was still there talking to them when it had 2 conformations and they still would not accept it. Their software makes a split second decision on whether or not to trust it as a 0 conf payment and after that there is no way to override it. It's really dumb. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 07:21:50
He tweets garbage like that fairly often. In my experience it's almost always some crap with Ethereum Classic that no one cares about. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:51:46
I don't think they would accept a sell that big there. They also run an exchange called GDAX and that's where they would direct you. Someone who actually wanted to do this would more likely reach out to what's called the OTC (over the counter) markets. Where they match up high value buy and sell orders so that they don't have to worry about spooking the markets with big orders. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:27:52
Is this why the price is remaining so high? Tons of people can't find an exchange to sell on? I'm in the same boat.

@_date: 2017-08-14 05:44:24
That is the dream yeah. It will take awhile before that's a better idea then dollars though. Bitcoin is super volatile even if it is mostly in the upwards direction. Right now Bitcoin is still being built and we are still trying to figure out what it is good for. Once we figure that out we can value you it. When all that happens volatility will come down and we can use it as currency. 
As far as selling a large amount the otc markets can handle very high vollumes. No 50k restrictions to worry about.

On the contrary, $50 is a perfect starting point. Just enough money to keep you interested in bitcoin news stories and watching price gyrate wildly. All that will teach you a lot about how bitcoin works and if you end up thinking it's a good idea you can put more money in over time.

I think of bitcoin as walking around the man not fighting the man. Other than that I agree with you. I must have given away at least a full bitcoin by now 5$ bucks at a time to anyone who showed any interest. I also have brokered a deal between a blogger I know and a Venezuelan ghost writer that wanted to work for bitcoin. You got the right idea get out there and do it. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:44:25
We are just trying to value and frankly build Bitcoin right now. No one knows what the hell it is or what its best use cases will be. When we finally figure that stuff out the price will stablize and then hopefully it will be a currency. That being said I use bitcoin all the time but I use it because of ideological reasons not because it's the best currency ATM. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:13:47
In a slightly different point I really hate this users are in control bulshit. If Bitcoin is controlled by the uneducated masses I want no part of it. I happen to agree with the users this time around but it is absolutely rediculous to say that the minners and industry have no influence. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 18:18:36
With GDAX you have to wait for your ACH transfer to settle before you can buy any bitcoins. With Gemmi you can lock in the bitcoins right away but can't withdraw them until the ACH settles. That's why I switched. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:58:26
His most recent blog he was explaining how he just sold his gold company. To me his explanation of the new company sounded like they were trying to make a e-gold network. All his reason for doing it and the advantages of doing it are super similar to bitcoin except one thing. You have to put full trust in the e-gold company. I'll take bitcoin thank you.

Signalling was only signalling readiness. The signaling threshold for activating segwit was hit triggering segwit to activate after 2016 blocks. So in about 11 days segwit will be active and users can use the new functionality.

Sure I'm just trying to get you to understand that neither system is free you just don't see the costs in the current system. To go further customer protection is possible with Bitcoin and will be implemented. Either Bitcoin will help that system to be more efficient and it will gain market share or it won't and it and Bitcoin will never gain adoption. Either result is fine with me but it's facinatating to watch.

@_date: 2017-08-14 05:08:41
Yep lol 
Pin is lock on the device
Seed is a mnemonic version of your private key.
Passphrase is an optional password that you can use to further secure your bitcoin even if someone steals your seed.
The most common use of a passphrase is to have a bit of bitcoin stored with no passphrase so if someone steals your private key they will see the small amount and not know that most of your money is behind a passphrase. 
Protecting your keys is very important. So it makes sense to have lots of options for more protection.

I believe 110% that Bitcoin is a good idea and good for the world. I love becoming more wealthy because of it but when the price goes down I am never tempted to abandon the project. I just move my Bitcoin ticker widget off my screen and do my best to avoid price discussion for a few weeks.

I'm with you. All this nonsense about Bitcoin not being good for retail payments is depressing. It wouldn't be the end of Bitcoin but if it can't handle all kinds of payments it is not nearly as interesting. I for one think lightning is going to get us a long way when it comes to retail.

@_date: 2016-12-21 07:07:34
If you bought bitcoin anytime except for a handful of days it's good for you. 
No one prices anything in bitcoin right now because it is small and unstable. We hope it will grow mature and become stable enough to price things in some day. 
This is just too speculative to respond to directly so I'll just point out that bitcoin is an immutable ledger that can be as transparent as you want it to be. If the voters demanded that the government transparently using the bitcoin blockchain then the rich would have a harder time capturing it and increase their wealth unjustly. That only leaves them options that create value in society to enrich themselves further. 
What btc retailers went bust? In reality, there are no retailers at all. Unfortunately, in bitcoins current state it's not very good for retail transactions. There are a few different ways purposed to improve bitcoin in this capacity and I hope we as a community can come together and implement the best one. 
Bitcoin will only be adopted if it's valuable to society and so far the evidence I've seen points to the fact that it is valuable. Obviously, you disagree but I would ask you to examine your perspective. I assume you grew up in a peaceful country with good goverment and never saw your government backed currency lose half its value overnight. Before you dismiss it completely try to imagine if it's useful outside of your circle.

I agree with you there is a ton of value in the current system. I think bitcoin has an uphill battle if it wants to compete with it but I guess I have more faith in the bitcoin then you do. Also we have to keep in mind that there are lots of places in this world where bitcoin does not have nearly as stiff of competition as it does with the wonderful payment systems we have in the US.

Well, fortunately, or unfortunately bitcoin is one hard weed to pull. No government is going to be able to stop it. So we might be heading down this rabbit hole whether we like it or not. It does align with my personal belief of the best way to run an economic system so I'm happy about it but that does not at all mean that I'm not scared that I'm wrong. 
I appreciate your skeptical opinion and I think you make valid and logical points. Of all the people I pissed off with my shitposting you are my favorite.

To be completely honest I don't know. I assume interest rates would have to higher to reflect the opportunity cost of just holding money. I don't have all the answers but I do know this. Given the chance to hold a currency that is intentionally inflated or one that is finite and increasing in value, I will choose to hold the finite one. 
Inflation does not have that great of a track record either. People being forced into riskier and riskier investments to beat inflation has caused many bubbles. Another characteristic of these bubbles is the bailout. Transferring value from the taxpayers to the entity making the risky investment. Such a thing will be a lot harder to do when you can't just create money out of thin air. 
So to me, the real innovation is taking the power of money out of corruptible hands. If bitcoins monetary policy is not right that's fine. You can take bitcoins innovation and apply it to any monetary policy you want and then the people can decide what to use. Many have already done that and overwhelmingly people prefer bitcoin.

Yes, Yes you should but if you dont understand bitcoin enough to come to that conclusion on your own then you probably need to do some more research. 
Start with taking some money away from a negative habit and buying a few bucks worth a week. EX: If you smoke, smoke less and put that saved money towards bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-06-20 03:27:38
It does not mean that at all. It just means a lot of people are making Bitcoin transactions right now. Maybe to get money off of exchanges after the recent hack. Maybe to get them on to sell them for the same reason. Also could be bitthumb moving all their balances to cold storage.

I have a drawer full of bitcoin shirts. I wear them almost every day and about once a week someone notices them and I get to do my best to give them an intro to bitcoin. 
I have a Facebook group message with my friends that have expressed a bit of interest and I send out a little update whenever something big happens. 
I have given a presentation at my office trying to parrot an Andreas speech the best I could. I did a terrible job but I have had 3 coworkers approach me for more information after they had a brush with bitcoin in there personal lives. One for gambling one heard about purse.i o and one interested in dark net markets. 
I always try to emphasize that it is interesting technology that can solve problems and try to dispel any get rich quick dreams and make sure they understand that there is a large chance that the price will go down but also that if they really understand the technology that should not worry them. 
I also have made contact with someone in Venezuela on Reddit it's a long story but I rallied people to donate bitcoin to him after one of his comments about the economic situation in Venezuela blew up. We have become friends and I was able to get him a job writing blogs for a co-worker. They originally were using PayPal but the fees were high and he actually had an easier time exchanging bitcoin for his local currency then using PayPal. So my coworker gives me money every few weeks and I send bitcoin to him Venezuela. I honestly did not pressure him to do this he came to it on his own and it's the most powerful peice of evidence that bitcoin is working that I've ever seen.

They should mark up the chips accordingly to make a profit. What do you think people are just going to stop eatting because the value of there money is going up a fraction of a percent ever year?

Best option is to spend between $30 to $100 dollars on a purpose built bitcoin hardware wallet. It's easy safe and will walk you through the whole process. I have a Trezzor, Ledger and Kepkey also make good ones. If you dont want to spend any money on it yet paper wallets are a good bet. I'll link a guide below but the basic premise is to create the wallet on an offline device with trustworthy software and then wipe that device before ever connecting it to the internet again.

0 conf payments are not actually that bad. Yes of course they could get scammed but it's not a very easy thing to do. The service can do a few things to limit their risk. Check the fee is sufficient, Check to make sure there is not another competing transaction on the network for the next 3 or 4 seconds, make sure it's not an RBF transaction and only accept payments below a certain amount. Again yes they could get scammed but they get scammed with Credit Cards all the time they are used to dealing with that risk. Of course one giant downside is rejecting a payment is a huge chore. You have to get in contact with them to return the bitcoin. So yeah lightning will be better but 0 conf payments are troublesome but workable.

I am worried and I do think it's a huge change but as you say a half a percent change in the interest rate can have a massive effect. Central banks and governments currently hold that power and maybe that is fine for the most part but some countries abuse it for Example Venezuela. I would like to see bitcoin compete against goverment money. Maybe it's no match for a well run centrally planned economy like the US but I think you have a hard time arguing it's not better than some alternatives. 
Bitcoin will only be accepted if it's useful if not there is nothing to worry about if it is it will be for the better.

I was put off by coinbase raising their fees from 1% to 1.5% so I started looking around. Switched to Gemini didn't find it more difficult at all and the fees are much lower. One downside for a beginner is gemini does not have a mobile bitcon wallet service so you will need to pick you own. I suggest BitPay. Nice clean interface and it babies you through your first time doing anything. making sure you don't make any mistakes.

You will probably be right in the future. That doesn't mean someone can't take advantage of low fees while they exist. There are 0 rules about who can use Bitcoin for what. As long as you pay a high enough fee to get mined your transaction is just as valid as anyone elses. That being said your right this is a very inefficient use of blockspace and in my opinion it will certainly get outbid in the future.

 Hey I have been checking out your site for a while and I really like the idea of passing on savings to your customers when you can. I would like to point out that accepting bitcoin might allow you to pass some more savings on to us your customers. There is no risk of charge back with bitcoin so you don’t have to price that in and there are also very low transaction fees. Keep doing what your doing and I wish you the best of luck.

It's not best practice but don't listen to the people that tell you it's dumb. If you know enough to secure your own money than that is a far better option but if you have not yet put in the effort to learn you might make a mistake so letting coinbase handle it is a fine option. That said you absolutely should make an effort to learn enough to do it safely yourself and a hardware wallet will make it much easier. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:41:31
I don't think you need to be concerned about it. You will be able to remove your coins far in advance of any change that they make and I think the chance that 2x ends up with more proof of work and a higher price in the long run is close to zero. As long as you are keeping a watchful eye and paying attention and it seems you are then you will be fine. They wont like try to pull a fast one on your or anything.

Keep in mind the more access you have to your wallet the more potential attack vectors there are. You might consider a phone wallet and a paper backup. All it requires is writing down a list of words. Then if you lose your phone your bitcoin is safe as long as you have that list of words.

Imagine every bitcoin is a seat on plane. There are only so many seats. If bitcoin is a flight home on christmas than each seat is going to sell for a lot of money. If it's a flight to Arizona during the summer (something people don't want very much) seats won't be worth very much in fact the flight might be canceled altogether if not enough people are buying tickets. 
It's just supply and demand. Supply is limited demand is an open question. That's why no one knows what a bitcoin is worth right now.

@_date: 2017-11-06 16:09:44
I think the phrase trade immediately will lead you wrong here. In the best case scenario you will need about 30 minutes for various transactions to confirm a few times on both chains before you will be able to safely split your coins and then send them to an exchange and that will take another few transactions. We are very unlikely to have the best case scenario. So you might want to double or triple this time estimate. 
If you want to trade right away. You should move your coins to an exchange that you really really trust before the fork. Of course this comes with the risk that they will screw up or steal your coins. So its kind of a catch 22. I myself have chosen to let coinbase handle it for me and then move the coins off as soon as I am done trading. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:41
it's because you still have the option to cancel the transaction from your side. If you did you would walk away with your USD and the Bitcoin. Credit cards are instant but the fees are also much higher to compensate.

You are not wrong. Strong governments banning Bitcoin would tank the price and scare away most users. Bitcoin dosent have the entertainment value of an illegal torrent but it does have utility.

Thanks for responding. I'm new to this level of bitcoin but i'm enjoying learning. 
My goal is to import a mnemonic that was generated on a trezzor with some coins in a segwit address into bitcoin core.
I was able to put the mnemonic in to Electrome to get access to the private keys and imported the legacy addresses successfully but then i got stuck when I tried to do a segwit address.
I know it would just be easier to send the coins but my circumstances prevent that.

I personally believe that this is one of the best current use cases for bitcoin. Most first world consumers don't have much reason to use bitcoin for transactions but eliminating the friction of money changing while crossing boarders could be huge. If there were a popular tourist destination that boasted alot of bitcoin merchants I would certainly take that in to consideration in selecting a vacation destination and its something I think I could sell my friends and family on as well.

How else do you think this could get started? Just magically be perfectly stable and trusted from day one? We have to build trust day by day and with that trust comes the price. One day it will hit equilibrium and become useful as a unit of account and means of exchange.

You're not wrong but the amount of people taking out loans for bitcoin is ridiculously small. If you really want to get scared think about all the debt that got taken out for useless college degrees. Of course not all degrees are bad if your education helps you earn enough to pay back your loans that's good but it seems to me that people are not working or working at starbucks after school way too often.

Your understanding is correct. If a private key is lost and unrecoverable the bitcoins are forever inaccessible. As the ecosystem grows I’m sure best practices will be developed to make this a very rare occurrence. The thing that makes this a non-issue is that bitcoins are infinitely divisible. Even if we get down to very last bitcoin the protocol can easily be changed to allow that bitcoin to be split as many times as necessary to allow the desired amount of units.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:27:45
Because I believe it is or at least will be the best form of money we have ever had. I will buy things with it but why would I ever want to go back to a lessor currency?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:20
Yes and no. I spend bitcoin every chance I get. There are a few ways to spend bitcoin and get a discount and those are pretty solid. Most of the time when i'm spending bitcoin though it's ideologically driven. I could just as easily make the same purchase with fiat maybe even easier but I choose to use bitcoin because I believe in what it can be and I want to help build the community.
For now the price of bitcoin is no doubt mostly driven by speculation but the technology is improving rapidly and there is a roadmap I believe is possible and will allow bitcoin to scale for instant cheap transactions for the entire world without having to rely on a central third party and I am absolutely willing to speculate on that.

It's scary but bitcoin address have error catching. The last 4 digits are a hash of the address. So if it doesn't match it's an invalid address and cant send.

Maybe, but they are also trying to stop people from using bittorrent hows that going? It's also pretty hard to justify. "Citizens! it is now illegal to use math and computers to keep track of your purchasing power! We don't give a flying fuck if Canada is doing it youre not allowed to!"
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:16:24
Yes you can buy any amount you want. It's an identical situation to exchanging dollars for yen. It's strange that we talk about Bitcoin in such a large demonization. Its an artifact of it's rapid growth. One mBTC is worth $10 dollars is a little easier way of thinking about it but even that is pretty high now. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:34:40
Agreed. Even if it goes to 0 5 seconds after you bought it that is still the best story that $200 can buy you at this point :P

Purchasing power reffers to the amount of goods and services you can trade your money for. If the value of Bitcoin goes up you have more purchasing power if it goes down you have less purchasing power.

I will sell them all eventually. Probably 25% asap 25% during the next few days while I watch the price and 50% when i'm absolutely sure I was right. HitBTC was actually really good when I used it during the Bcash fork but if i'm going to leave my money on an exchange and let them split the coins for me id rather trust coinbase as a regulated US institution to do that than HitBTC but that is just personal preference.

The reason you store all transactions is so that you can verify for your self the state of block chain. Imagine that you want to join your system in progress. How do you have any idea that all the rules were followed in the past? Or if two different states are being presented to you how do you know what one is correct? If you can start at the beginning and work your way forward with each transaction you can know for sure that all rules were followed and what the proper state of the block chain is.

Hey man, 
I might be misunderstanding your question, but if your looking to buy bitcoin you are probably looking for an exchange not a wallet. I recommend Coinbase.com as the safest option but I think it will take a few days to verify your account. I think your quickest option is Localbitcoins.com and that would usually involve meeting with someone and exchanging cash obviously with some risk. Happy to help if you have any other questions. Sounds like your in hurry but if you can slow down and do your research I would recommend it. Bitcoin is amazing but there is a bit of a learning curve right now.

Sorry but I disagree it's not a good idea. Far more Bitcoin have been lost to an overcomplicated recovery process than have been stolen. If you want some added security use a passphrase.

I use Bitcoin about weekly but I'm a crazy fanatic. I think what might be lost in the noise is that Bitcoin has the *potential* to be a revalutionary new currency. For that to happen it has to grow to a point of equilibrium and become much more stable. It also needs some technological improvments to make it easier to to move. People are mostly betting on wether it will succeed right now. In my humble opinion it can.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:34:08
You are on the right track. There is a risk that someone will replay your transaction that you sent to your self though. Not a big deal unless you then send another transaction thinking that you were safe from replay attacks. So to be safe you need to send your btc2x coins to another address you control then also send your bitcoin to a new different address. After that you are good to go.

Keeping a secret is fine with me but expecting a patent to be honored in a world wide anonymous system is ludicrous. The only correct descion is to mine in the most efficient way you know how.

GDAX HitBTC Gemini are all options. You are headed for some pain though man you should not do this. If at the end of your research you think bitcoin is something interesting you want to be part of you should just buy some and use it / hold on to it. If you buy and sell all the time the tax burden and fees are much higher and it's literally just gambling no one knows where the price is going to go.

Nah it will bundle lots of transaction together before putting it on chain so it will increase throughput. That is if they ever figure out how to do it.

So the main issue is it's not a consensus rule so it's all just whatever miners feel like doing? We should expect them to do whatever is in their best interest.
It seems to me that if both RPF and CPFP are possible it just ends up being a bidding war with the winner getting to chose where the payment goes. What a mess lol.

What would it look like if everyone stated taking advantage of this?

@_date: 2016-02-24 00:21:44
I'm with you. zero-conf would be awesome but it requires trust and I think the community can do better than that. After reading all this and thinking about it I actually think RBF should just be default. 
If you are going to attempt zero-conf then you need to trust and the extra trust that is required for RBF is not that much greater. 
I believe and hope that someone will come up with a brilliant solution for this. My next research topic is going to be to try and learn everything I can about LN i guess. 
LN to me seems strange overly technical and complicated. I bet it's actually fairly similar to how the uninitiated view Bitcon.

Not to say anything bad about Gemeni I very much respect what they are trying to do but im curious what is there advantage over coinbase? They seem to operate on the same level of regulation the only difference I can tell is that coinbase is ahead in terms of states and countries of availability. Can someone explain what i'm missing? Even if i'm not missing anything I'm still rooting for Gemini we definitely want competition.

You currently get rewarded 25 coins for solving a block on the bitcoin blockchain. After a certain amount of blocks are found the reward will half to 12.5. This means there will be a reduction in supply and many believe this will cause the price to go up. 
A lot of people think that this is not built in to the price yet but it will be priced in when people learn about it. This chart would show that people are just now starting to learn about it.

I dont know a lot about it but I know they have a concept of a master node that requires 1000 dash. If you act badly you can lose it and if you correctly validate transactions you gain a reward.

Yep that's about right. The best one I ever found was two dogs in Tokyo. There is another one around the corner called pink cow. Pink cow was a bit run down though I don't recommend it. All though they did seem the most intuastic about accepting bitcoin.

Could you explain this to me? I don't understand why the payer couldn't do RBF and the payee to do a child pay's for parent and then the miner would chose the one that was higher.

Interesting that's different than I expected it to be. I assumed the extra fees would be coming from the remaining balance of the wallet not from the payment. 


Thats for the reading material.

is the correct subreddit for lightning discussions no need for a different one. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:46:56
Lapps are just standard apps that are using the lightning network. The only difference between an online store and a Lapp online store is adding lighting payments. 
There has not been any efficiencies found for running apps on a blockchain and that's not what lighting does. If you want to look in to that kind of exploration on bitcoin you could check out rootstock.

I was one of those people. I was so excited about Bitcoin that I was willing to ignore the terrible experience of paying with it. Eventually I came back to reality. I didn't give up on it though I just got excited about the lightning network and started trying to use and grow that instead. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:02:06
Without doing any research. I am assuming this will be a centralized approach similar to Coinbase. Most transactions will just be an update on Kakao's internal ledger.

are you sure your not talking about Peter Schiff?

Just to clarify there is no such thing as an "official" lightning wallet. That would be kinda like asking what the official Internet browser is. Sorry for the ummm actually but it's an important distinction to us bitcoin nerds :)

@_date: 2018-11-27 05:43:51
As far as I know there is no way to do this without a third party also having access to your money. So I cant see the bitcoin community getting behind this kind of system. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:15:43
Yeah I think it is a bit of intentional tongue in cheek. The people that coined the term were poking fun at the fact that no one has found a point for a dapp and that lapps will accomplish much of what they wanted to do in a far more effective manner.

I have heard great things about Amir Takki and how he was instrumental in the early days of bitcoin. When I found bitcoin he was fighting for the freedom of the people on the front lines of Syria and no one had heard from him in a year. When I finally heard him speak though it seemed like incomprehensible gibberish though. I'm sure that's like bitcoin sacrilege but i'm not sure how he got the reputation he has. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:50:26
Yeah I think the original comment was a but miss stated. It's not that they advocate for not running nodes it's more that they think not everyone needs to run a node. So they don't think it's important to keep the requirements for running a node low enough for most people to be able to choose to run a node.

My user name clearly shows my bias in this matter but blaming a technology for people's actions has always struck me as a poor argument. Furthermore not all governments are good. Maybe you want your government to be able to "monitor" everyone and keep them safe but do you want the Venezuelan government to be able to spy on and crush dissidents? Calling the speculation out as risky is spot on though.

True. It looks like they direct people to a fake block explorer page though that shows them receiving transactions and sending out rewards. So Id be a bit surprised if they did both. With how much of this we see on twitter i would be super surprised if it was not a successful scam.

I haven't heard of Coinmama but I think your time frame is a bit unrealistic. If you buy from any of the exchanges i have ever bought from they won't have validated the payment for 4-5 business days and you won't get your bitcoin until the credit card payment clears. 
So is it a scam? I don't know but there is nothing out of the ordinary about a slow credit card payment. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:58:18
They are jerks. We don't need to wait for the block reward to fall though. If fees are significant than miners that collect them will be more profitable and able to expand while miners who don't collect them will not.

Back in the day Airbitz (now Edge) had these cool cards they handed out with bitcoin on a qr code. Someone gave me one. I peeled off the sticker with the qr code on it before any one could tell me better. I had figured that was the public key and the private key would be under it. Little did I know it was a special QR code designed to work with the airbitz app and I had just destroyed it. Probably about 50 mbtc gone forever.

It's a little boat on a bumpy ocean right now. No one is seriously suggesting that bitcoin as it is today is a good unit of account. If there were to be an open source decentralized currency how would you expect it to bootstrap itself? Would it just instantly pop in to existence perfectly usable and trusted? or would it look like what we are seeing? Slowly gaining adoption trust and value with bumps along the way when that fragile new trust gets shaken.

You don't it's correct. The greatest proof of work chain will always come out of the unity of the majority of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The only issue with it is that you need to allow for enough time to ignore temporary anomalies.

I was under water on my first 2 bitcoin for years. I felt dumb for a week or so but then I kept learning and researching and decided that it was a project I wanted to be involved in regardless of the price. I bought a lot more at lower prices and it worked out really well for me. No promises on making money but if you really understand the promise of bitcoin you wont worry about the price much.

@_date: 2017-10-09 23:24:09
In my opinion the value of Bitcoin is 80 percent speculative 10 percent transactional efficiency and 10 percent store of value. That's because it is only the best choice for those purposes in very fringe cases. On the transaction side you have black market goods that the legacy financial system won't touch and companies that are offering discounts to people purchasing with Bitcoin. On the store of value side you have places like Venezuela where they have no good options for store of value. They would much rather use gold or dollars but they can't. 
All that adds up to a pretty small amount of commerce in the grand scale of things but as trust in Bitcoin grows it will get better and better as a store of value and as the technology improves and transaction fees drop it will become the best choice as a transactional currency.
Bullish but pacient.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:41:33
No problem I always like to talk bitcoin. 
To your first concern about losing bitcoin. I don't think it will be a problem if bitcoin is adopted it will be valuable enough people will learn not to lose it. If it did become an issue bitcoin could be changed to be divisible by even more decimal points. So instead of every bitcoin being made up of 1 million satoshis we would create an even smaller unit. Each lost bitcoins value is just added to the remaining bitcoin as they become more scares. 
Trying to explain price movements is fools errand. Bitcoin is global and there is just way to much going on to know what is causing what. If I had to guess it's simply that bitcoin is still here. The longer it lives the longer it seems it will live. Every piece of bad news that hits bitcoin and doesn't kill it proves it is strong enough to survive that particular type of disaster and maybe it will survive the next one to. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:01:31

I am still living off of usd savings. I have always been pretty good at keeping a 6 month or so emergency fund and right now I'd rather spend that than Bitcoin. 
I think there is a very substantial chance that Bitcoin will fall significantly in value and that would suck for me but it wouldn't be the end of the world. Logically it probably make sense to take some gains off the table but I won't. I really believe in the idea of hard money. I think bitcoin is a fantastic way to accomplish that in the digital age and I want to support it as much as I can.

The flip flop is terrible but I don't feel like this is a bad stance. The miners can't just keep minning and claim the longest chain. If they go against consensus they will be burning money very quickly. The chain with the most accumulated proof of work will come out of the harmony of the majority of the community working together and that's exactly where coinbase should land. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:46:29
You seem to know exactly what you're talking about. :) I'm sure you are hoping and actively looking to keep cutting middle men out the equation. Do you ever do the stupid little thing if you ask the cashier if they accept bitcoin yet? After they look at you confused and say no you hand them the card and say "why don't you just try it really quick and see?" Cashier dumbfounded "I didn't know we did that. "
Makes me chuckle every time. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:02:45
Except people like me won't declare it bitcoin. In the short term we will reject it. If miners continue to mine it they will only be burning money and they will be competing against people being rewarded handsomely on the correct chain. They will then switch over or go bankrupt. The chain with the most proof of work will be the one with the majority of the ecosystem on it. If you don't belive that then you don't belive bitcoin works.

Because it happens every 2016 blocks...?
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:15:40
Yeah, but it does it in a really weird way. It's probabilistic, so if someone owes you 500 millisatoshis essentially it will flip a coin to determine who gets the sat. That will make for a pretty weird way to buy a hamburger.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:55:13

I'm not convinced that an ETF is good got Bitcoin. I bet it would probably be good for price but it will create challenges around decenterlization. Bitcoin must survive this if it's going to reach it's full potential though so I'm grabbing the popcorn on this one not trying to push one way of the other. 
@_date: 2019-09-06 01:37:41
I worked in digital advertising for years. I'm pretty familiar with revenue per session numbers. (all the pages a user loads on a particular visit). On sites with tons of ads we would get like $0.10 per session. With more conservative ad placements we would get more like 0.02$ per session. Anyways I think that $0.10 is a little low maybe $0.20 per day would be a bit closer.
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:05:34

You have time. They are forking at a block today but they are not releasing the software for another month or so. I don't remember the name but there is software that will automatically pick the best coin to mine for your hardware and the trade it for bitcoin and send it to you. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:53:23
is a great muffin. Good explanations man. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:08:19
Yeah I have actually used this service. It was a disaster. They rejected my payment and couldn't explain why. Took me 4 months to get my Bitcoin back. Even for someone who is a huge Bitcoin advocate I can't get behind this for the masses. Lighting seems way more promising. 
Turns out they rejected my payment because green address wallet default sends transactions with rbf btw. So it looked like a potential double spend to them. The thing is though the payment confirmed while I was still at the register but they still couldn't accept it. 
@_date: 2019-09-09 05:09:40
Seriously cool. Any plans to try and make an actual product?
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:40:42
This is correct answer and with it you can build protections comparable to the legacy system but I don't think you could ever quite reach the security of a reversible payment method. It's a great problem to be thinking about good thread @_date: 2017-10-31 17:50:11

The minners are apparently defining it as a 0 fee transaction. Bitcoin has no rules that say minners need to include transactions. With no incentive why bloat the block chain with sometjing the sender dosent even value?
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:44:35
Yes that is what I'm saying. If you don't control it you don't own it. PayPal has a long history of locking people's money up. 
Bitcoin is better because of this. If you use it correctly you and only you control your money.

The problem is if you don't let Bitcoin core shutdown correctly it can corrupt your local copy of the blockchain causing you to have to revalidate it from scratch. It takes a few days on my system so I was happy I was able to avoid it.

So you don't need to wait for the channel opening transaction to confirm because it's just Olympus waiting on there own transactions and they trust themselves obviously. Credit card fraud and charge backs will be a huge problem though. This service will not come cheap.

You're not wrong bitcoin is a pretty bad currency in its current state but 2x is a lot of work and risk for very little reward. There is a huge demand to upgrade bitcoin as demonstrated by all the work to implement segwit and lighting and many more upcoming upgrades.

I agree the rules are imperfect. The question is can we make them perfect? Bitcoin has to work in spite of bad actors.

The ultimate goal is a decentralized universal currency that you don't need to go in and out of. I agree that bitcoins fungibility could be improved and there are multiple efforts working towards that like bullet proofs schnorr signatures and coin join. So far the best solutions come at a trade off to scale though like Monero. 
@_date: 2019-09-29 15:01:04
Personally I think the biggest downside to Bitcoin is user experience. Being your own bank is hard and good software can only make it so easy without centralizing it. It could be that bitcoins greatest accomplishment is getting the banks to inovate just long enough for people to stop caring enough about the benefits of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:51:24

Just because you think that doesnt make it true. You can very easily determine what bitcoin was involved in say the silk road. If people start valuing those bitcoins differently than we don't have fungibility. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:10:03
If so the best run operations will survive and the worst will fold. Difficulty will adjust and Bitcoin will continue on not giving a fuck.

How has gold stabilized? People trust it will have value in to the future. Some of us believe Bitcoin will be the new gold standard as people begin to trust it and trust it will have value in to the future.  
The Inflation of bitcoin is systematically determined and transparently spent on the security of the network. The inflation of government currencies is at the whim of the central banks and governments and is used for whatever they deem fit. That's fine if your government is good. Bitcoin is for when you government is not good.

Yes I belive your understanding is correct. The transaction will remain unconfirmed and waiting to be included in a block. These transactions are considered valid though just unconfirmed. So maybe it should read something like If the transaction is not included in the block it remains unconfirmed.

At a very broad level. Many of the financial institutions that have shown interest in this space have created their own in house solutions based on bitcoin. This is one of the first instances that a financial institution has said that they are interested in using bitcoin instead of building their own.

@_date: 2018-04-13 13:15:03
Yes and no. Bitcoin definitely gave me a more global perspective and I do indeed feel less patriotic but Bitcoin can't replace government. It can however stand as a check against governments being reckless with devaluing their currency and that's a very good thing.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:14:53
All the prize gyrations are a function of size and shouldn't be the focus of anything. Consumers probably do not care about decentralization you are right. They also don't care that they are being invisibly taxed by 3% or more a year and that's why we need a decentralized currency.

Don't rush it. First bitcoin needs to be finished. After it's finished the market can value it. Once it has been valued then it can become a viable currency.  
Until then it can be useful for a ton but don't expect it to be stable.

He is saying to tip someone they need to have open a channel. Not they have to specifically have a channel with that node. 
I was thinking about this for awhile. So far I am thinking the solution would be If you try to tip someone who does not have a channel yet. It will tell you they don't have a channel then It can tell the person someone wants to tip you follow these instructions to make that possible. After they open a channel the tip bot can ping the people that tried to tip in the past and see if they would like to tip now.  
Either that or be a custodial tip bot but who wants that? 
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:21:08
That really is an off the charts outlier. My bet would be bots.

Yes Bitcoin is the largest unit of the currency. It can be broken in to 100,000,000 satoshis the smallest unit. The rest of your questions don't have answers. Many people are deciding that they think Bitcoin is a better system of currency than our current systems but the only way to really decide that for your self is to learn how both systems work and draw your own conclusions. One point you may not have considered is that only a fraction of the world population enjoys as good of monetary system as we have with the dollar.

1. if more miners come online and find blocks faster after a bit the network will adjust and make mining harder to get the average back to 10 minutes. 
2. Yes discovering a block allows you to add 1 mb of transactions to the network. So in a simplified world Confirming transactions and finding blocks are basically the same thing.

As long as you have access to the private keys and you do. Then you can import the bitcoins in to a different wallet if you need to. You are fine to just sit tight. Avoid spending anything until this BIP148 stuff resolves itself. If you need to spend while things are still settling do a lot of research first.

Gambling online in the US is illegal at least in most states. There are ways around it but I think the most common method is being able to do a bank transfer to the casino but then having to have a paper check mailed to you to cash out any winnings. They also often have a fee for cashing out to the US. So bitcoin has some ease of use advantages. While the risk is really low not having your name so directly attached to illegal activity is also a benefit. Unfortunately congestion on the bitcoin network is driving up fees so it's getting to be less beneficial but for now it's still the best option.

Miners collate Alice's and several other unconfirmed transactions into candidate blocks.* 
Blockchain refers to the over all data structure. 
Several systems called miners with the Bitcoin...
This one should probably read something like the intention is broadcast to the bitcoin network (nodes and miners) 
If invalid the translocation will be rejected instead of remaining unconfirmed. 
Getting pretty close though. You obviously have the overall idea.

There is no need to store your own money on your full node so don't worry about doing that. Syncing means it asking other nodes for the entire blockchain and instead of trusting that it's getting the truth it is checking every transaction ever to make sure that no rules were broken. After it has caught it up it will then monitor the network in real time making sure that all transactions follow all the rules and providing pieces of the blockchain that other nodes need to validate the chain for themselves. If you support the decisions core is making make sure to update your node to there latest releases it wont do it automatically.

I don't think I said that bitcoin would have an infinite price rise. 
You are right on the money with the comparing bitcoin to precious metals. It's issuance was actually based on gold mining. So take the scarcity of precious metals and add the ability to transact globally instantly and you have Bitcoin. Yes you can't make jewelry out of it but maybe people will find it useful anyways. 
I think it will take years and years to discover the price of bitcoin and at that time volatility will reduce drastically but you are completely correct that it won't go away entirely. If you participate in a stable financial system like the US Dollar maybe that volatility will make it very undesirable for you but not everyone has that advantage. If you are in Venezuela even today's bitcoin looks like a safe bet.

You can't get adoption without a price rise. You are right though Bitcoin can't be a unit of exchange until we figure out how much it is worth and it might take awhile to figure that out. In the mean time it can still function as a store of value and a medium of exchange​ as long as there are easy on off roads in to stable currencies and assets.

I am not sure about bitcoin.com they are probably doing it out of ideology. F2pool I belive is known to intentionally troll with their signaling. 
The signalling seems very correlated to the price right now. They could be making some money in the markets while they have this much control.

You should understand bitcoin before speculating on it. Just buy some trivial amount for you for now. Use it understand it then decide if its something you're interested in.

Eliminate that step of having to buy pre paid cards. IMO best way to do that is just to keep using bitcoin whenever you can and eventually merchant adoption will build.

Definitely could be that as well, but I was monitoring the fee estimation and I was constantly seeing it recommend something higher then I would have chosen given the market conditions and super economy was always getting me into the first block.

You are missing the economic part of the equation. If I set my node to enforce the rules I belive should be enforced and then transact based on the blockchain according to my node then my vote comes from my economic influence not my hashing power.

The fee for buying can get pretty low if you use an exchange like gdax or Gemini. As far as the fee you pay when you make a transaction​. Yesterday was the busiest day on record for bitcoin and fees were like 250% higher then average. The Bitcoin network is going threw some growing pains atm. There are tons of proposed solution to scale the network. Here is to hoping that the network selects the best one and continues to grow.

Mining is very competitive. Unless you have access to unusually cheap electricity it's most likely not worth it. Cryptocurrency is new fascinating and just maybe useful. In my opinion it's worth taking the time to learn about them.

That is actually in correct. You can prevent a transaction but you will be found out very quickly. You can double spend but you will be found out relatively quickly. You can't steal someone's money. You can't create more Bitcoin. Everyone on the bitcoin network validates and enforces the rules wether they are minning or not. Not saying a 51 percent attack is not bad it is but it's also not complete control.

The Bitcoin network is designed in a way that on average it should take 10 mins to find a block. The amount of time it takes to propigate and verify a block is less than 15 seconds.  So it is unlikely to find a block in that time and even more unlikely to have it happen twice in a row.

My UASF node makes my computer run so slow. Seems to eat up all the hard drive resources. Anyways not an issue or complaint.

Adoption = Demand. If more people are finding it useful then more people will be needing to buy bitcoin to use it. Since the supply of Bitcoin is so constrained that means people will very quickly be out bidding each other and paying more. I think you are right that crazy price volatility will scare away and make alot of use cases difficult. So we see this insane Oh! bitcoin is useful I should get some. Holly crap! the price of the bitcoin I just bought is sky high I should sell it before it crashes. Causing a huge crash type behavior. One day bitcoin and bitcoin knowledge will reach a point of difusion where it will allow it to be valued accurately and the price volatility will subside. I can garantee without a doubt that that price will be between 0 and infinity.

@_date: 2017-07-27 06:13:26
To expand on my friends elegant point. This idea is a non starter for anyone that understands the space. The point of a blockchain is to eliminate trust in a central authority, and to avoid that central authority you gain a lot of inefficiency and cost. To store a physical something to enforce the backing of a coin you need a central authority. So using a slow expensive blockchain to then just give all the trust back to a central authority makes no sense. It makes more sense just to have the central authority (bank) keep track of all the physical something on simple database and the company Gold Money does just that.

Absolutely right. I am not saying we can't and should not increase the block size but the only people that agreed to it were miners and companies. Users and developers largely did not agree and are under no obligation to go along with them. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:43:22
Lots of miss information in this thread. This is a common tactic used by all miners and is nothing nefarious. When a new block is found it takes a bit of time for it to propagate across the network and be validated. During this time miners can either choose to shut down or keep mining but if they keep mining they have to be sure not to include a transaction that was included in the block that they are still validating because that would make the block they are mining invalid. So the safest thing to do is mine an empty block until the previous block has been validated and they know what transactions are still waiting to be included in the next block.

You are not wrong about all the crap on the front page and you're not wrong that Segwit2x (implemented with out bugs) would not be the end of the world.

But on nearly any payment method you could be using stolen funds or do a charge back on the payment up to 6 months later. There is no way for any of us to know you won't do this. That's why Bitcoin is so valuable.

He does not pay a 10,000,000 satoshi fee. He locks that money up in a multisig address with the other end of the payment channel. The logic attached to that money is something like. In 10 days all this money gets sent back to me. Then if you want to pay the other party you give them a transaction that says pay yourself 1000 satoshis and pay me back the rest. As long as the other party broadcasts that transaction before the 10 days is up they can be sure they will be paid. 
Here is a decent video on the subject:

Bitmain can't survive without asic boost? You can go ahead and toss that assumption out the window right now. They have a shit ton of money and produce the best mining hardware in business.

You sound like you are ready man. You understand this is a technology that has a chance to mean something and not a get rich quick scheme. Just start with whatever you are comfortable with. 5 or 10 bucks a week is a great place to start. Bonus points if you can take this money from a destructive habit like smoking or drinking. Stay cautious and keep learning.

For example you guys both shop at Amazon and have a payment channel open with them. So you say psst, Amazon if i give you 5 bucks will you give it to that guy? Amazon says sure but can I have a few satoshis to cover the tiny cost of routing this payment? Sure you say. A Quarter of a second later the payment is routed to your friend with cryptographic magic that ensures there is no risk of Amazon stealing the money.

Bitcoin is unfinished code with only 8 years of testing. The economic model is new and unproven. Some people believe that the establishment banks and governments will attach Bitcoin in the future and you can't have a more powerful oponent. Bitcoin has struggled to accept even bug fix upgrades for the last few years while other similar cryptocurencies are already running that code. Increasingly it looks like it would be easier to move to an already upgraded coin then keep trying to upgrade Bitcoin. 
Sorry that is really rambley I just woke up but there are plenty of reasons to be very skeptical of bitcoin. If you can square your self with these and many More. Welcome aboard.

Fractional reserve banking is just a riskier savings account. In a fair system you would be rewarded with a higher interest rate for that risk that you chose to opt in to. I'm not saying that what we have now is fine but it's the fact that governments have guaranteed the bank accounts thus removing the risk and reason for banks to be cautious that's the problem.

That is true, but if miners did that it would be a hardfork and would require everyone in the entire bitcoin network to update their software to follow them.

Buy and hold some bitcoin. Help show that people trust the network to be a good store of value. 
You can also run a full node that will validate transaction and ensure that no one tries to break the rules as well as improve the decentralization of the network and make it more resilient to attacks.
