Thank you.  
This seems very interesting, but more geared to the concept of attacks on Bitcoin. I read the index, and there is no mention of Privacy at all

Thanks! That is definitely a tool that enables maintaining privacy.
However, I am looking more for information such as this   [   as blockchain technology is now being recuperated by corporations the way bit torrent was.  
As the current new source of wealth is private data collection, I am trying to understand if there are ways to use blockchain technology to collect private data from blockchain in a way similar to what is done today on the Internet.  
Nobody voted for Zuckerberg and letting people like him have the means to, in effect, print money in addition to invading our privacy seems a catastrophic prospect.
On the contrary, thinking ahead of time of ways to prevent the next take-over by corporations requires fully understanding the potential of blockchain to guarantee users privacy and leverage it to starve surveillance capitalists through calibrated means.

Actually, I am not at all in favor of stablecoins, but my opinion matters little in the great scheme of things.  
I am trying to gather information to be better armed to prevent the occupation of the space by permissioned blockchains of any kind, including stablecoins.  
Refusing to look at things the way they are is not really the most efficient way to further your goal...
