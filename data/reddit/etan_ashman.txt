It was actually 10,000 bitcoin for 2 pizzas, which is more than 100 million usd now.

What's the controversy about bitpay? I'm out of the loop, why do many people here dislike it?

Ah I see. Thank you

That's a very good question, although you might want to ask u/sph44 where he is getting the 2.2% figure from as he is the one making the claim, I was clarifying  it.
EDIT: he appears to be referring to a currency conversion fee charged by the bank where he holds usd and uses that usd to purchase something at a store in Britain that only accepts British pounds. The transaction is authorised by the bank at the time but the bank then has to settle the transaction later in a different currency to what their customer actually has. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 00:16:47
He/she isn't talking about foreign transaction fees, they're talking about the exchange rate spread. Whether your credit card waives an actual transaction fee, it still needs to use a particular exchange rate, which may have a hidden cost to doing so depending on the exchange rate itself.

The creator of bitcoin. He disappeared some time ago. Noone knows who he really was or if he's still alive

Because they were already doing it to large accounts, the article is talking about how they're now doing it to smaller accounts as well

Yeah that's great thanks mate, I really appreciate it

Hey, just came across your comment and was wondering. In your article where you write;


What happens if for instance you use crypto for personal use but through good fortune find yourself in a situation where your crypto started out at $5,000 and is now worth 1 million dollars, but rather than withdraw that $1mill in cash you continue using it for personal use?
For instance, paying rent via BPay through livingroomofsatoshi.com and using perhaps the TenX crypto debit card for all day-to-day purchases?
Technically you'd be living off massive profits but it's still primarily being used for personal use, correct?
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:51:30


I use Globee, it doesn't provide a settlement option for fiat. It settles in either cryptocurrency or you need to link a BitPay account for settlement in fiat. So I guess they technically do offer settlement in fiat, it just happens to be via BitPay.
Othwerwise you can also select to have the settlement in bitcoin sent directly to Uphold or Luno, where I imagine it would be fairly easy to convert to fiat from there, but it's basically just having your bitcoin sent to an exchange.
Edit: Extra clarity.

I'm wondering, this would just show the balance per address yeah? So would some of these sub 0.1 btc balances be subaddresses belonging to a single address that we can't connect to?

I suppose you could send bitcoin through shapeshift into monero, then send from a monero wallet back through shapeshift into bitcoin. Shapeshift wouldn't know where the monero came from since it's untraceable as far as I know
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:29:24
Yeah no worries, mate. It's a good company but their ID verification process is the most intense I've ever seen, probably to anticipate any future money laundering concerns the Australian government has.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:32:11
I don't understand. Gold and ore were discovered, bitcoin and bitcoin cash were created. I was given BCH out of thin air and sold it for BTC that I didn't have before, I literally recieved free coin worth money. How is that not new money being created? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:20:58
Search for what? OP didn't ask anything 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:22:58
Coinspot is an Australian company
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:10:46
Okay I get what you're talking about now. I think for myself, a better analogy than the gold/ore example you gave is something like if I created a painting today that didn't exist yesterday and people were willing to pay 10,000 for it, that's not creating 10k out of thin air, it's creating something of value to other people.
EDIT: not sure why OP's comment was removed 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:39:02
No idea to be honest, no one knows your financial situation better than you. I honestly don't know what you 'should' do, but if you're thinking of putting a lump sum in, at least mentally rehearse seeing your investment go down 20-30% and ask yourself if you're okay with seeing that loss in value.
If you can honestly be okay with seeing that then you'll be fine, if not, consider investing a smaller amount you'd be more comfortable with.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:21:06
Not too sure about btcmarkets but I've recently stopped using coinspot, something is really fishy about it recently. They claim they buy and sell for the same price but for some reason if you open up the buy and sell pages on separate tabs and enter the same amount at the exact same aud/btc rate you spend more if you're buying than you'd receive if you were selling, even taking into account their absurd purchase and trade fee of 2%.
Stay away from coinspot in my opinion. I've started using btcmarkets but wouldn't know the reason for the aud/usd spread

Didn't the cash fork cause a lot of concern leading up to it? Seems to be the opposite right now

I'm not sure why ISPs would target miners, or even if they did whether it would be all ISPs doing it together, but sure I suppose that could happen. 
On the other hand though, we've seen the effect that the Chinese government has had on the crypto market, everything tanked and then recovered to new heights, I don't see how one government's decision to deregulate internet service providers is going to be detrimental long term to cryptocurrency. But then again I'm not American so I don't know the ins and outs of the net neutrality debate. I don't think there is too much to be concerned about though

When bitcoin was falling over the weekend due to the BTC vs BCH drama, I watched over the course of 2 hours as it continued to fall. I got nervous for the first time in a while and traded for tether with the aim of buying back in lower. I put my phone in my pocket, got in my car and when I got home 15 mins later bitcoin had sky-rocketed to $300 above my initial buy in. That was when the Korean exchange went down.
You're not going to be able to time it all the time, every time, you might get lucky some times but even the pros make losses. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:26:41
The ID verification process for Coinspot is pretty intense but I've had a great experience using them. I just think they want to anticipate any possible money laundering law breach concerns, the Australian government would crush them if there was a whiff of that going on. If you don't look like how you look in your ID and you don't want to cut your hair, maybe bite the bullet and update your ID
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:25:58
I just dollar cost average. I buy bitcoin on the same day every fortnight when I get paid, whether it's up or down. Today's ATH is tomorrow's dip (not literally tomorrow obviously).
I don't worry about buying at an ATH, I think of it as buying the next dip in advance.

What's monero like for small transactions? Downloaded the new GUI this week and looking more into it. I'd heard the fees aren't so great, but I also see that you can select fee level in the GUI, what's your experience been?

It was above 10k aud on coinspot for a few days last week.

A "bit" is already a term used to describe a measurement of bitcoin. A milli-bitcoin is 0.001 BTC and a Bit (also called a micro-bitcoin) is 0.000001

Ah okay so what you're saying is that it's not so much that a new coin was created out of thin air (which it was) it has more to do with how much people value that new creation

I received mine yesterday and it came with a welcome card that says it doesn't need a tamper proof sticker. Also I think the security card is for the ledger nano not the ledger nano S which has a screen to enter a security pin on the actual device

PayID is instant deposit for BTCMarkets. All the big 4 banks have PayID and many of the smaller banks also have PayID now.
Edit: Including u/colafroth in this comment so they are aware of this payment option also.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:32:13
Hey bud, Aussie here too, you should check out coinspot. Their ID check is a bit intense but you can despoit money instantly with no fees through poli payments.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:02:49
Perhaps exchanges are preempting the day governments step in and demand ID verification of customers and potentially suspend those that aren't doing those checks.
@_date: 2019-09-21 12:49:03
 is great and a smooth experience, although depending on your location you may need to use a vpn as some regions are blocked for trading

It's increasingly difficult but you can do it. 
LocalBitcoins is no longer a viable option since their move to KYC, and a lot of the sellers are asking for identity confirmation anyway.
An alternative option is to buy either Monero, Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash through [LocalMonero]( [LocalEthereum]( and [Local.Bitcoin.com]( respectively and then once purchased, use Morphtoken to exchange it for Bitcoin.
It adds an extra couple steps before receiving Bitcoin but it's doable. Some people may not like my inclusion of Bcash in this suggestion but I've included it in case the other 2 options don't fulfill your needs as it's an anonymous exchange.
LocalMonero would be my preferred choice due to the privacy inherent in the Monero protocol but has very few sellers in my local region so I often find I have to fall back on one of the other 2 options I've mentioned.
EDIT: Another option is to simply ask a friend to buy bitcoin for you and you pay them cash.
EDIT2: A third option is [bisq]( a decentralised, peer-to-peer exchange that routs all activity through the Tor network. I've used the application and it's very simple and elegant, but I've never bought anything with it because there are just simply no sellers in my local currency at this stage. The other thing with this is you need to make a security deposit of bitcoin, so you need to actually have some bitcoin to start making trades, which depending on your desired level of anonymity, you may have to use one of the other methods I've suggested at least for the first bitcoin buy.

Well I mean I guess if you have a business and receive payments in Bitcoin you're still just recording the actual sale price in USD value, it's just that if the business isn't converting it to USD in the short term they also just need to track gains/losses when they eventually convert it.
