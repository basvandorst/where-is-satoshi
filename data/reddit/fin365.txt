Thanks for the info. No idea what Dlinking is either sorry. Although I did briefly hear about and look into the fact that apparently now I have bitcoin cash that I can "claim", every website instruction I've found so far has been confusing. Is there a simple way to sort out this claim?

I still have an "unconfirmed transaction" from 2017-11-10 19:00:28.. Nearly 48hrs! Does this mean my transaction will also be processed, definitely, in the next 4 hours?
The fact that the blockchain wallet I used to do this didn't warn me that it might take 2 f*cking days, is another reason why I probably won't be bothering with Bitcoin after I finally manage to cash this out. Bought in in 2013. The fact that (a) the waiting times can be so long &amp; (b) noobs like me are not warned about this, makes me more than a little frustrated with the slow progress and apparent lack of attention Bitcoin's user layer has received. It's been 4 years and this is STILL only fully accessible to geeks.  Someone like me who hasn't got time to keep up with all the latest details of the hows and whats of bitcoin come along, try to cash out £1800 for a friend, mess it up due to ridiculous "transaction times" and the friend has now lost about £100 in value. Not a good look, bitcoin. Not a good look at all.
