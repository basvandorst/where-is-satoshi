If I have a device like a Trezor, can I just pull my BTC onto my wallet and then start with Gemini?   Or can I just use Trezor software to conduct transactions?

Once I move to a device like this, or a Trezor, can I just buy and sell through the Trezor site?

Is anybody adding now that its under $1600?  I'm considering adding a bit more.  anybody think it will continue to drop?

Isn’t what he is doing like an ATM withdrawal though?  Most banks charge $2.00 for this.

I’m just in it with extra scratch - no major funds.  So I’ll probably add, if it drops add more, if it increases maybe add.  Basically, if I end up believing in the concept and innovation of it, there would be  to reason to panic.

I'm just thinking of buying now.  I just don't know if I'm too late to make any serious gains.  I guess if I'm holding for 5 years or more, there is a lot of upside potential.  
I think the fear becomes, if everybody starts to dump - who is going to cash me out?   That being said - if the community truly believes in BTC, I will most likely buy if there are larger drops.

I’m one of the few hoping for deep dips.

Is it correct that if you’ve bought and hold you probably don’t need to report?

I know you’re not a tax advisor but when you say alts, you don’t mean transferring to a wallet right?

Is there a book about how non-developers can master bitcoin for their careers?  I’m just curious as to new areas that may develop.

It’s hard to imagine it being adopted mainstream with so much fluctuation.  Will the masses adopt a currency that can buy a computer one day and just a banana the next?  I’m not sure.  It may need to stabilize for a while for the mainstream to adopt more.

Are you in the US?  How do you calculate your taxes?

I’ll have funds in my account on the 21st.  Hopefully it waits until then!!!

How do you choose when using something like a Trezor?

I work in production. I’d be willing to consider a complete career change for a promising and rewarding 15 year career.  I’ve always wanted to shift into coding but have zero experience and just don’t know where to start.  Is there an area of coding that would lend itself to cryptography.  
I don’t think i fully understand the implications of cryptograohy yet.  Things like validation and machines owning bitcoin etc...  any thoughts that you have are appreciated.

What kind of carbon footprint will bitcoin have?  This seems like a tremendous amount of contribution to climate change unless it’s clean energy.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:22:24
Please explain.

Thank you!

Does anybody have speculation as to if this may lead to a drop out of the gate?
