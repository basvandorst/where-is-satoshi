Pretty expensive for what you get compared to the likes of Feral Hosting. Shame they don't accept bitcoin.

Especially if the new site / service / product is targeted at less tech savvy users.

I have made a couple of investments on it but I cant help thinking I'm going to get scammed.

When I buy things on ebay I ask the seller if they accept bitcoins. I usually pay using paypal in the end but send some links and information about bitcoin.

If bitcoin was used by existing users who have built up good feedback and reputation they have a lot to risk and are less likely to scam. I wouldn't think twice about paying in bitcoin from such seller.

The report was full of misleading information. To compare ordering on silkroad to one-click ordering on amazon is preposterous!

The one I've been waiting for! Sold enough to break even on my investment.

Looks like you're right there. I payed for my current Wuala allowance using bitcoin a while back. It was a manual process and a case of emailing for a quote for the transaction. I wonder when they gave up on it?

What a great idea!

Be sure to check out and and watch some of things in the sidebars. Precious metals are a pretty 'safe' investment in many people eyes.
