THAT is what I'm trying to figure out. I've got the cash on me right now. 
So, the thing is, I've got to buy bitcoin and then get my mother to SET UP an account for me to send it to. Then she has to convert that back to greenbacks to send to my bank account. 
A hassle, but I hope to save SOME money and not get extorted for 10%

I'm in Turkey and I want to send money to the USA.

Yeah, I just posted what they'd charge me to send $1200.... they wanted $110.... So I'm going to arrange for BTC

Just sold BTC and deposited into my account. I'm lucky enough to know a serious BTC buff here who's also a co-worker and friend so I'm set :)

I got so fucking angry when I realized I'd have to part with $110 to send my money to my mother in the USA. 
I should mention that $110 is a lot of money for me as I'm paid about $8.5 per hour with no benefits, no bonuses and no overtime. 
I was absolutely infuriated and was happy to find this post: 
That's the other thing. I wanted to do a bank transfer to the USA but my bank here in Turkey doesn't do "dollar transfers" or some bullshit like that. I spent 2 hours waiting in line to find that out. Totally f__ing stupid and why the banks are going to go the way of the dinosaurs.

It's good man. I just need to get her set up. 
She's REALLY behind the curve on this stuff and will likely view BTC and Coinbase with a sort of mix of naivity and xenophobic suspicion. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:20:17
She can transfer to the USD by then selling the BTC on localcoins?

Yeah, to transfer money in and out of the country you have to pay a crap load of money. Either a $45 wire fee (from our end, doesn't count the amount they'll have to pay) and 3 working days. 
Then there's Western Union which also takes too much of a cut. 
It's complete garbage and I'm sick of it.

Oh wow! That's really convenient!
