Can Bitfinex buy these tokens stealthily on the market or do they have to legally announce their plans?
People were asking why Bitfinex wasn't contributing their own money to lessen customer losses... It looks like their plan was to use uncertainty about their future to get people to willingly sell their liability back to them at 1/3rd the cost?

I'm sure they already know the vulnerability.. probably some very complicated holes in the security software. They aren't releasing the details of the hack because releasing all the information can compromise investigations. 
Keep in mind that there must be many organized groups of very experienced hackers working around the clock to hack all of these exchanges. Bitcoin is a great hacking target and you can expect any organization with a lot of it to be under constant attack.

I'm not a lawyer but there is a difference between doing something that leaves you open to civil suits Vs something that could land you in jail.

People who had BTC stolen are happy with this outcome because part of their lost funds are being payed for by other customers ETH/fiat.
If my ETH had gotten stolen I wouldn't expect them to sell your  BTC to pay me back. Or siphon some money off some guys cash deposit.

I'm guessing everything is already working and ready to go live. They are probably busy trying to figure out how to minimize mass exodus before flipping the switch.

Well I guess I was confused when they said altcoins were unaffected.
Preferential treatment? lol, if you see it that way you probably had BTC on Bitfinex

Those guys had live websites they had to maintain. They both left breadcrumbs, especially the silk road guy who made a ton of security mistakes. They also both had positive proof of ownership in their possession.
 However, if someone got caught with stolen bitcoins, that isn't really proof that they were the hacker.
The Bitfinex hacker is obviously a security expert. The 2 people you mention were not at all.
The chances of tracking down the hacker and recovering the money are almost none.

Bitfinex doesn't but the hacker did, right?

I am 100% certain they will use the stolen money to fake another moon landing but this time on mars!

Recover the stolen bitcoin? what a joke!
Even if they traced it and connected it with a person, they still won't be able to recover the money.

Wouldn't it be cool if banks were stopping them from taking your money and hair cutting it then giving it back to you?

Wouldn't secretly buying these tokens back on the exchanges be against the law? Wouldn't this be illegal even if they announced it?

I only had ETH in my account. Are the really going to take some of it so they can cover money stolen from other peoples individual bitcoin wallets? Is that even legal? Shit.. did I Agree to that without reading?

Anyone smart enough to pull of this heist is probably smart enough to cover their tracks. 
Even if they did a bad job laundering the bitcoins and got caught cashing some out.. that is still miles away from legally proving that they were the hacker.
You would pretty much have to get the attacker to plead guilty and return the coins as part of a deal.
But I guess stranger things have happened?

Sure, just realize the huge differences between this and that.
