Tried gdax today for a very small amount, for the same reason - high fees on Coinbase. It is the exchange behind coinbase.
I used ACH to transfer USD on Coinbase which is free and takes 7 days approx. Coinbase to Gdax is instant. Then placed a limit order on gdax with my transferred USD. It was fulfilled in 3 minutes. 0 fees. If you sell you pay the fees. If you buy at market price you pay the fees. If you place a limit order you may pay 0 fees or a small amount based on the price and limit.
I then moved BTC to another exchange to buy another currency. Not sure how but this was free too and took 30 minutes for 3+ confirmations, and for btc to be available on the other exchange.
I will continue using gdax, it was a good experience.
Hope this helps.

What if I trade one cryptocurrency to another, say ETH to BTC? I am not gaining or losing, so I don't think there is any change in the income tax. But do I need to report any trade, USD to cryptocurrency or between cryptocurrencies?

So I cannot just generate an RSA keypair using some key generation tool, and send cryptocurrency to the public address, and use the corresponding private key to maintain the balance and use the currency.

Like I already mentioned in the post script, this is against exchanges not Bitcoin.

Or, you can use a credit card with travel benefits for purchases, and service like Xoom for instant cross border transfer, and it would be business as usual.
Sure, you cannot be anonymous.

I want to buy sometime next week if price goes down and move the bitcoins out of online wallet by July 30.
I need a way to achieve this fast without ridiculous fees, if possible.

You could be HODLing since say 2012 and sold now in 2017. You may consider the person a HOLDer and not a Trader. But for IRS you gained on your capital. Is it a grey area, or have people faced implications of not reporting their cryptocurrency trades?
P.S.: still new to the cryptocurrency world, so making sure I understand IRS for now and future, before investing heavily.

The keys/coins are on your machine, not on their servers.

How do you guys report your gains (or losses) to IRS?

As mentioned in OP, bank already processed it on Friday.

What if being in the US someone trades using Australian Dollar via Australian exchange?

Came across this while researching about my own question.

I think there is a long way to go before "bitcoin is bitcoin".
Right now bitcoin's value is determined based on fiat. And different exchanges having different rates due to different local currency is not helping.

What is the next best option, that doesn't take weeks to verify at multiple levels before you can buy with USD?
