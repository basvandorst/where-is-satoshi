If you trade crypto and haven’t read the Bitcoin white-paper yet, you are wrong.  That being said, it’s always cool to revisit once in a while.  One day it will be considered as a historical document that started one of the biggest changes the financial world has ever seen.

You want answers, then do some research.  Or don’t, I don’t care if you end up losing your money.  If you play the game right, you can make some money at the moment, but this won’t last.  It is unsustainable.  If you really want to talk, and not call me a fucking troll, then we can have a discussion about why myself, and many other experienced crypto investors believe that this is all coming to a head, and the impending crash is no longer avoidable.

Laziness could save your ass at the same time.  It’s a world of chaos we live in, you never know what is going to happen.  My being lazy and not going to the gym today may have saved my life.  I’m not sure who it was, but a celebrity was out drinking late one night, and was feeling hungover/lazy the next morning, so he missed his flight and rescheduled for a later one.  The flight he was supposed to be on didn’t make it to the destination, instead, it ended up slamming into one of the twin towers.
In this case, yes, your laziness cost you a lot of money.  But had you made that money, your life would be entirely different from what it is today.  A lot of good, and bad things could have happened in that time frame.  Sorry to get all philosophical; I just find it so fascinating that the tiniest of changes in ones life could have catastrophic results.  We should be plenty happy that we live such comfortable lives compared to the majority of the people in this world, and that we are in a position where we can afford to buy virtual money and potentially see huge gains.
That being said, I want more.  Lol.

Bitcoin will drop soon, and hard.  Will it happen at &amp;20k?  I think so.  $20k is a milestone, and a lot of people are going to sell.  Bitcoin has become a fad over the past month; there are a ton of new buyers now, and at the first sign of trouble, they will bail.  Most of these people don’t even know, or care about what Bitcoin is or how it works.  It is being manipulated right now, and the whales are settling up an ambush.  The holders will hold, and buy more when the drop occurs.  Following that, we won’t see the gains we are seeing these days.  At least not for a while.  The people who went all in will get slaughtered, unless they got in under $6.5k.  I’m not trying to scare anyone, I’m just facing reality.  These are only my opinions, and I’m not a prophet.  That being said, I can’t see this trend continuing, and it will sooner drop than stabilize.  There are just too many weak hands involved at this point.

Right, it just happened to take a shit when you could have bought at such a low price.  It’s more likely that Coinbase/GDAX intentionally went down to prevent people from buying at low prices, hence saving them tons of $$$.  You realize that there is nothing stopping them from doing that, or insider trading/market manipulation for that matter.  Fuck Coinbase/GDAX, they are fucking criminals.

I was recently banned from r/btc for exposing the obvious “pro Bitcoin Cash” accounts that were less than a week old with less than 10 posts in their respective histories.  All of the posts were shilling Bitcoin Cash.  The scam is real, very real.

I’m in the U.S., and I know that 0.31 BTC is not much in the grand scheme of things.  For me, it’s about more than just the money.  While that was a lot of money to me, it represented even more than monetary value.  I was putting a ton of time and energy into learning about BTC and other cryptocurrency’s, as well as money that I didn’t need to pay my rent, for my groceries, and get to and from work.  I changed my spending habits and cut a lot of things out of my life so I could start to build the foundation of my BTC investment.  Bitcoin became something that I enjoyed being a part of; I even started looking into code and crypto in general so that I could have a better understanding of it all.  For a good part of my life, I have struggled with severe anxiety/depression an PTSD.  It’s been hard for me to engage in social activities, or any activities really.  It is extremely rare for me to find something that I see worth doing.  Once I got invested into learning about BTC and it’s potential applications I was hooked.  I agree with the entire premise of it, and I think that it is the most logical monetary system that has ever been thought of.  
After seeing everything I put into it just vanish, I felt a sickening sensation of loss and waste.  I will never be able to start back from 0 bitcoin like I did a while back.  It’s not because I’ am afraid that it will happen again, or because of it’s price; it’s just a feeling that I can’t really describe with words.  Now I am going to miss out on what I think is the future.  This shit has been so demoralizing and hard to deal with.  I was so dedicated to bitcoin one day, and then this happened and changed something in me.  I have been stolen from before, but this time it felt different.  I feel like I am being left behind, or like I have been betrayed and abandoned, but no one cares or something.  It’s a shame because I saw myself being involved for the rest of my life, but some asshole had to come along and take what wasn’t his.  These fucking people are so cowardly and pathetic that they are ok with ripping off anyone they can when possible no matter what it may do to the person they are stealing from.  They are too fucking lazy and pathetic to actually work for something, so they fuck up peoples lives just so they can buy a new iPhone or some shit.  No matter where you go or what you are doing, it seems like there is some asshole that will always actively try to take whatever they can.  The real icing on the cake is that the Ledger Nano S I ordered a while ago finally arrived, but now that it has it is worthless to me.  Goodbye to another $100 that could have been spent on something I might need or like.  
Sorry about ranting off about it; I just don’t know what to do with myself.  I am feeling all kinds of things about it, and I don’t know what to do to address them.  It kills me to see things like this happen to people who don’t deserve it, while so many that do have nothing happen to them and go on living like the pieces of shit that they are.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:43:26
Serious Question:  What if you want to pay and it takes a long time for the transaction to clear.  Do they allow you to leave after just one confirmation, or do you need to stay until the block is mined?  I’ve always wondered this about restaurants that accept bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:33:51
It took me months of working overtime and not buying anything to get to 0.31905 BTC.  As of yesterday morning, the world around me has come crashing down.  
All of it is gone, and I don’t have any idea as to how it happened.  As far as I know, I did everything right to ensure it was secure.  It doesn’t sound like much compared to what most people have, but it was everything to me, it was the foundation of my future, which I actually believed, and it’s fucking gone.  I can’t even get out of bed.  I know that it is going to keep increasing in value, and a lot of people will make a lot of money with it.  That said, I don’t think I can ever buy into it again.  All most all of what I had was bought at or under $5,500 and now it is over 7k.  Fuck my life, and fuck whoever the scumbag piece of shit that steals from others.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:19:53
I know that, but injustice is relative to what you know and how your life has been up until that point.  I am willing to bet that if all of your bitcoin was stolen from you, you might react a lot differently that what you imagine.  We live in world where every person has to do what they can (without breaking the law) in order to survive.  It’s not my job to make sure that someone from the other side of the globe is receiving what they need.  The simple fact is that everything I worked for is now gone, and I have every right to feel the way I do.  Am I supposed to be like “Well, the people of “insert country” don’t have any “insert noun”, so I don’t really care that my things have been taken”? 
And yes, there is far more to life than bitcoin.  Buying it and keeping it was only half of what it meant to me, as I mentioned before.  
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:57:07

It’s worth it if the tiny percentage of a single Bitcoin you manage to put together doesn’t get stolen somehow.  So I’m my experience, it isn’t worth it.  I guess it depends on who you ask.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:51:18
May I ask you what you are planning on doing?  Personally, I'm in it for the long game so even if BTC took a massive dump I would just hodl on to what I have, and buy up as much as I possibly can while the price is low.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:04:07
I know how you feel.  Someone managed to gain access to my computer through our “secure” network at work.  I work in a highly secure government building, so I’m willing to bet it was someone who does IT work or operates the network.  I only had 0.35 bitcoin, but it took me months of saving to acquire it.  I got all of it for around the $5,500 price point, and now that bitcoin is worth about $8k I just can’t bring myself to get back into buying it.  I wish I could thank the scumbag who obviously has no problem with stealing from a disabled veteran for destroying what would most likely have resulted in a positive change in my life.  That, and introduce him to an anxiety/PTSD fueled beating.  My entire mentality has been completely changed as a result of the theft.  
Now that I can’t seem to buy back into bitcoin, I fear that I’m going to miss out on a huge opportunity to make some money that I could definitely have used in a couple of years to put a down payment on an apartment so I can stop throwing away my money by renting a place I’ll never own. Even if I could get past the mental roadblock, I don’t have the money to buy more than a couple hundred dollars worth.  It took me months of abstaining from purchasing anything other than the bare essentials in order to buy the amount that I did.  
I hope that you are able to recoup your money.  It hurts so badly to see your hard earned money disappear; especially when you really aren’t at fault.  It would suck to lose money as a result of making a poor investment that fails, but losing money like this is just soul crushing.  Best of luck to you.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:50:30
That’s awesome of you to offer to do that.  I don’t want you to send anything that you can’t afford to without affecting your own financial situation.  I sent you a PM about some stuff I would love to send you as a thanks regardless of whether or not you send me anything.  It’s not anything of great value in terms of money, but it’s some cool EOD related stuff that I acquired throughout my career as a bomb technician.  Here is my address, but don’t feel like you are obligated to send me anything.

I am very aware of that fact.  But it doesn’t help that nearly half of the posts on r/btc are made by accounts that are less than 10 days old and have no post history other than Bitcoin Cash shilling.  I was recently banned for bringing that information to light.

I don’t really know.  It had to have been someone that is close to me, or someone who works in my office building, and was monitoring me on my computer through some method that I don’t know anything about.

He is directly supporting it.  I watched a video in which all of your parliament was questioning him how the hell he was allowing this and he read a prewritten response off of a sheet of paper while stuttering the entire time.  I will have to look for the video, as I viewed it on Reddit, but I will do my best to find it in a timely manner.

Oh ok, I just wanted to make sure you weren’t “investing” money into a site that mines and promises you a return on your “investment” in 48 hours.  Here is an example.  BTC-ORE.COM. I DO NOT recommend that anyone trusts this site, or others like it.  A few guys I work with have done it a handful of times and they did payout as promised, even one transaction where a guy “invested” $5,000 and received $10,000 back in 48 hours.  I believe they payout a few times to random individuals to gain trust, and then if you send them a large “investment” they will ghost you.  If they do what they claim consistently, they would be losing money at a ridiculous rate.
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:10:39
Cloud mining?  Can you explain further?  I’m aware of what cloud mining is, but specifically what are you doing?

Saul Goodman’s doing most likely.  Craig hired him, and he stole the documents, modified them, and put them back.
It has worked before, and might just work again.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:06:13
That is what I believe.  So I am guessing that they rope people in buy paying out a few times, and after they gain your trust and you “invest” a substantial amount of money they fuck you over.  I’m surprised that the guy who put in $5,000 actual received the 10k two days later.  I guess they got him though because now he is taking out a 10k loan so he can “invest” it and make another 10k in profit.  
It’s rather telling that you can’t invest and pay via Visa/Mastercard.  If you could, then the credit company could just do a chargeback if the site screws you over.  By only accepting BTC, they can just ghost you and there is no way that you could get your money back.
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:08:28
So I can't really do anything but wait it out huh?  I mean it isn't much, I just need it to make a purchase so I can get to a whole number and withdraw from the exchange.  
I was looking at some sites where you can broadcast the transaction, and i even tried it.  I got an error message saying something about the transaction being orphaned or something.  I don't know, I just find it ridiculous that we sometimes have to wait more than a couple hours for a single transaction to go through.  Such is life
