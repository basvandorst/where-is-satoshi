One thing I don't understand about LN is, if you open a channel to a friend with say 1BTC (costing you a small fee) then someone else sends 1BTC through your channel to them, does that essentially force you to make another channel to them costing you another fee?
I maybe missing something here but if people use the network to move lump sums through the network in one direction (possibly maliciously) I feel like it would end up costing everyone collectively to reopen channels.
Could someone please explain to me where I'm going wrong, because surly I must be?

I had the same issue when using a New Zealand bank card, so it's possible the currency or bank is not supported. Might not be your problem but thought I'd point it out.

She just wants Bitcoin to dip so she can buy in.

You can't really measure it because Satoshi and Grams are not relatable. Not without comparing their total value in USD or something like that but that.
However I would say Bitcoin will become rarer and silver will not.
1) You can't really lose silver, it can be recycled and more can be mined. You can lose Bitcoin (making Bitcoin rarer).
2) Our capabilities for obtaining gold and silver will expand with technology. You can not expand Bitcoin.
So Bitcoin in a way has and always will be rarer than silver and it's availability to us will become rarer as silver becomes more common.

Hey it's How did the writing of Pi go, how many post it notes did you end up buying?!
Can confirm this guy's not in it for the money :P.

Ahh too bad, I saw you guys replacing some on the stream. Who knew you would make it to and be there for so long haha.

Opps! I see bad use of scale and hear bad comparisons of units so often I must admit I didn't even look at the scale this time.
You are entirely right of course, sorry.

On an unfair scale... You can make any growth look massive if you scale it up. What if we measured gold in kgs against the USD then any growth in the value of gold will be exaggerated 32.15 times!

Any tutorial on how to make a RPi zero hardware wallet?

Hope it worked out for ya, surely with that much data it isn't just Bitcoin you would have uncovered either (if you were lucky enough to get the Bitcoin).

1600 was fun, lots of people started selling... Keep hodling! Then when pessimism kicks in, buy!
