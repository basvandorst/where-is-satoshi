That's assuming I found the right one. What an incredibly generic name. I'm coming from Bread and want to use a wallet that's not web-based, that's really on-device, and bitwallet says it is, which is handy. However, I can't really tell what's different about it and the others mentioned, other than GreenAddress looks to be web-based.

It's the circle of fees. They raise their prices (I'm looking specifically at Chick-fil-a which seems to raise them at least $0.50 a year) and I get slightly more cashback.
Without offering a cash discount (which IS LEGAL), I have no incentive to use anything other than my credit card.  If a store owner decides to offer a cash discount, they will get cash.
IKEA does this by offering 1% of your current purchase off your next purchase if you pay with a debit card, e.g., if you buy $50 worth of stuff, pay with debit, the receipt has a coupon for $0.50 off and you can use that the next time you shop.

It's really hard to reference this 15 year old site because SONY decided to make headphones called piiq, but back in 1999 there was a company that registered over 1300 domain names like this:
ptoysq.com, pbooksq.com, ptravelq.com, pautosq.com
the idea was that it was a unique "internet language" to help you find what you're looking for by "bookending" the word in p and q. It was a _weird_ idea, but novel. No pmailorderbrideq.com, though.
Old, old, old. And nobody remembers it but me. And unfortunately, no ads on youtube for it either, although they had a dude in a big p suit and a big q suit acting as "bookends".

You just agreed with me whereas I'm saying your request is silly. We have the dollar sign, yen sign, pound sign, euro sign, AND WE HAVE THE BITCOIN SIGN, not as emoji but as regular glyphs.

@_date: 2019-12-24 03:12:48
You'd have to propose that it changes from a mark to an emoji. [
Doesn't make sense as no other mark has it other than heavy dollar sign and that's only because it was part of the original japanese Emoji kit before it was standardized. However since there are now zero width joiners to add modifiers to emoji I suppose they could add it to chart with upwards trend. [

because 911 is just a forwarder. if you have a 1-800 number it doesn't actually exist, it just forwards to one or more numbers in a round robin. just like reddit.com is just a forwarder to any of the IPs in the CDN.  thus, when you dial 911 on your cell phone, you're not dialing a local number that's just "911", you're dialing a system that then determines _which_ local 911 affiliate you need to connect to.

@_date: 2013-04-10 10:26:19


Sort of! I'm not ernie98 but that is what he's saying. Parabolic means it goes up... and then back down. But stock often gets to a point where there is 'profit taking', people sell, and they sell now, with no 'buy wall' or 'sell wall' (which is a bitcoin specific term, nobody else says that, the terms are [support and resistance](  Anyway, there are two ways to sell a traditional security on the stock market:
set a sell order at market price (which means, I'll take the most anyone is offering), and at a specific price (I am willing to wait for someone to buy at the price _I_ want to sell it for).  When people want to take profit, they know they'll make money either way, so they sell at market.  Let's say I'm selling 1000 bitcoins and only 100 buy orders are at the high mark, and then the rest stairstep below that mark.  This reduces the Last Trade because I sold for less than it was currently going for.
However, at a certain point (and these seem to be round numbers, like it was 47.00 and 47.50 and 48.00) there are 'support' levels. And at this point there may be more buy orders again, and so the stock will actually bounce, which is called a [dead cat bounce](
I'm mostly bullshitting because I honestly am not a financial genius but there's some bits of truth here.  Bitcoin is supposed to go up, then down a little, like 2 steps forward and 1 step back, repeatedly. Going up and up and up and up is ridiculous and is odd, and frightens most traders because it's not what they expect.  It has to go down sometime, and a continuous rise is called a bubble, because it's the price is being inflated too quickly.  People expect it to burst.  Some believe bitcoin (like GOOG or AAPL) will go up forever, and as you can look at the history, they didn't.

I spoke recently with a small business owner about this, she was (oddly) complaining about how she used to use square, a banker (she actually said "banker") told her they were sketchy and it'd be better to buy access from them. And it's more expensive and less reliable to be using the bank, and their support sucks. My friend I was with encouraged the owner to go back to square. Looks like she's going to do just that.
I think people in would be way more receptive if Square took bitcoin, and it wouldn't be a huge leap. They could do it transparently.  I'll explain, briefly.
You know how [PayPal Here]( lets you pay by swiping a card OR using your PayPal account? [Square Wallet]( lets you pay by putting your card into their app and then 'checking into' the location you want to allow to charge you, then telling the cashier that you're paying with square wallet.  It's a relatively simple step from credit card to a 'funded' bitcoin wallet, if they were so inclined. I don't know why Coinbase hasn't contacted them yet about this.

It's still a maximum of about 70 cents if you're Apostate (the highest comment karma account on all of reddit). For most people, it's much less. The Redeem Karma function needs to give about $0.01 USD per 100 comment karma (or even 1000) to really entice the big users. And if there's a big user using bitcointip (someone who contributes valued comments), that means they'll get other people into it much faster. Result: adoption.

But are they? Some people got their product, but "investors" who pre ordered saying "I promise to wait" did chargebacks and pulled out the base. I don't know if they came into this planning not to deliver, but they certainly can't if their funding is charge backed.
It's like a self fulfilling prophecy: they need preorders to pay to make the things, they have issues and need more preorders to make the previous ones (exactly what happened with OpenPandora), and now people pulled back their money and they can't fulfill the preorders again. They should have been more open but I'm not even sure that would help. ASICMINER seems to have been super open and it worked for them. But they had limits, and that's how they restricted supply and also liability.

in the stock market, we have a term for this: day traders. if you believe in the security, and hold it, you have not _realized_ the losses until you sell.
if you believe in it, they say, buy more while it is "discounted". this lowers your average buy in price.  Let's say you bought 2 at $200 each. And now it's $70. Ouch. But let's say you buy 5.71 btc now, the same $400 worth. You now have 7.74 btc, bought for $800, for an average price of $103.35. Good on you!  If the market price rises above that, you are in the black again.

* I-KNOW-MARIUS
* I-KNOW-DOMINIK
* I-KNOW-THOMAS
This adds another gb after any of the ones above
* CONNECT-WITH-SUPPORT

I am bitbroke, I had only 0.005btc from the bitfaucet from ages ago and I gave it to archive.org, but had to give them 0.0045btc because of the 0.0005 fee I had to pay, and back then it was only $0.15USD.

Ok, so it says in that paper that the pool server is google-updaete.com.
















That's pretty much what's in the PDF as well, but what's interesting is the IPs have changed!
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    google-updaete.com.	10788	IN	A	199.59.243.106
    google-updaete.com.	10788	IN	A	199.59.243.108

    google-updaete.com.	10788	IN	A	199.59.243.107
They did a whois on the IPs (which were in the 76.73.75.* range) and it was on a different host completely. Currently, the IPs are owned by BODIS (which sounds oddly like DOBIS, the fictional company in the Billion Dollar Movie)
    NetRange:       199.59.240.0 - 199.59.243.255
    CIDR:           199.59.240.0/22
    OriginAS:       AS53665
    NetName:        BODIS-COM
I assume that as these continually get shut down as people contact abuse the pool loses it's ability to mine for a while.  So if you care about this, contact them! E-mail abuse and let them know the following
* The IPs 199.59.243.105-109 are being used for controlling a Bitcoin Mining Pool associated with a botnet
* The paper detailing the botnet (and the domain, google-updaete.com) is here: 
If you can find pools on blockchain, how do you find these?
none of those (the original IPs) have anything, and the new IPs also don't have anything, but there's gotta be some way to find the coins they mined!

I honestly feel bad for BFL. They overspent, now they're operating on a pyramid scheme, and people are pulling out the lower bricks of the pyramid.  If only they'd paid in bitcoin and had absolutely no recourse...
And for some reason, the OpenPandora operates on the same scheme (they lost the kickstarter money because they went with a shitty company), and every purchase is at double price because you're paying for a previous kickstarter participants device too.
I don't know why BFL doesn't just come out and say this. I assume OpenPandora works a little differently in that you're paying to play games, not for a device who's sole purpose is to generate currency.
BUT! Would you pay, knowingly, 1.5x the price of the item if it meant you'd get it several months sooner? A sort of "since you're [paying for someone else to get their device]( you get yours quicker" deal?
It makes sense that you would if you could be _sure_ it would happen. Because you'd get it so much sooner, the difficulty would be lower, and you'd earn your investment back quicker. Right?

Or just offer semi-annual options at $6 and get no fee, but that kinda screws over Dwolla ;)

Once a transaction is sent the public key for that address is now available in the blockchain, and Satoshi believed that Quantum Computing (look up the various threads in with the word 'quantum' in the post and you'll find posts on this topic) would make it easy to find the private key (the one you need to spend) for that public key.
Thus, to make it harder, he defaulted to sending change to a new address, which would not have a known public key.

Spoke with someone from an office near yours and he says you guys are hiring, and I said "yeah, they're not doing a great job marketing that fact".  You still aren't posting in or @_date: 2013-03-31 22:45:52
There was a post a while ago where someone tried to calculate all the "missing money" from people who'd posted about losing their wallet or forgetting their brainwallet phrase or whatever.
 Here's 17,000 bitcoins missing from one wallet failure.

The person was cap2002, and he got massively downvoted:

I haven't found it.  I found [the thread]( and his address is in it but the tx isn't. However an [article about it]( does link the transaction.

That's why I suggested this:


It basically says, FYI, you might wanna see if you need/want to pay taxes on this. If someone supports the government (or mafia) and _likes_ paying taxes, then letting them know that there's one more way they can do so (if they so choose) is a good idea.
As well, it allows deniablity. It's like how Amazon sends you a report (if you ask) for your purchases, so you can use it with your [Use tax]( I know a foreigner who moved to the US who actually posted how to do it, even though I know of no individual (other than him) who actually pays Use tax.
For those who give a shit, the URL is

I found a place not too long ago that gives a 10% discount for paying in Bitcoin! But... I doubt you'd wanna buy from them.

Low hanging fruit. If more of dropbox's competition accepts it, it lures people away from dropbox, and gives dropbox an incentive to accept it even more.

I think that making it easier to run a bitcoin node that's not also a wallet (such as, take it out and let me run it on my router or NAS or whatever, my router being one with DD-WRT and a USB port so I could easily plug in a flash drive and store the entire blockchain) would be nice.
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:14:25
Did he post the tx id?
@_date: 2013-03-22 10:27:06
this comment (mine) (here) is also a ploy.
but if I could get him to bet on the 0.0015% chance on satoshidice 10000 times (that's 100btc worth), I'd really like to know if he hits it. Statistically, he should, right?
Also, doesn't he just get bitcointip bot banned everywhere by verifying every transaction?

People are paranoid. Blockchain.info is alright, just use the daily e-mail backup feature and maybe connect it to dropbox (I'm sad they don't let you connect it elsewhere but, it's still encrypted to dropbox). Even bitcoin.org says it's safe if you always use the [browser extension](

Rapid rise is always a concern. Feel free to make a note in your calendar to come back and gloat in 45 days if I'm wrong.  It went from $33 to $2.51 before:

Yep, and I'm not giving them $70.  If someone asks me for the URL, I'll send it privately, but I don't want to post it publicly just in case more than one person sends them money.

Three bets at SatoshiDice, quite generous. Crazy that SatoshiDice is now like 50 cents USD minimum. Real casinos charge less.

lol. I don't think Apple is your problem.
TL;DR: Senators told Apple that it'd be an awful shame, what might happen if they didn't remove those DUI checkpoint apps. A real shame. Apple removed the apps.
Senators also don't like bitcoin competing with cash for illicit transactions.  Apple's aware of this.  There _may_ have been some communication, I don't know, but there's no news articles as far as I can tell.
Why punish Apple here? These apps are probably not long for the Play store, if they're still there already.

If you look back a few steps it looks like he makes a new bitcoin address every time he sends a payment.
make a bet on satoshi dice, send all your money elsewhere. I don't know what client does that! (I'd like to)

It's the transaction between two addresses, where one is sending 10,000BTC to another. You can then click the destination address and follow the money. It's not easy, though, which is on purpose.
