The hosting provider probably gave those IP addresses to legitimate customers after they got rid of the scammers...

Don't know about Africa but I live in a third world shithole, and while the number of bitcoin users here skyrocketed in the past few months it's used purely as a get-rich-quick speculation scheme, not as currency. You can't actually buy anything with bitcoin down here.

that's just how the blockchain works, man

The system doesn't know when BTC is lost. The blockchain is simply a record of transactions, "Alice gave X to Bob" (it doesn't explicitly record how much Bob has, that's worked out from the transactions he received). Once a transaction gets into the blockchain it can't ever be changed. Doing so will change the hash of the block where it's in and that of every subsequent block. This is what makes the system tamper-proof.
