This sucks, but explains why my recent 0 fee, but high priority 1 btc tx took 4 days to confirm.
@_date: 2018-09-27 00:13:34
i gave up on this as a puzzle a long time ago, but found it an interesting programming challenge to make a fast and efficient brute force algorithm.
given that the 6th word is ESCAPE, and there are 67 num/date groups in the puzzle, we need to find 11 other seed words with a total length of 61. and if we assume that the duplicate num/dates in the puzzle indicate the same letters, we have a faster way to rule out candidate seeds (a substring comparison is very fast).
the naive method of finding candidate seeds would be to iterate over the cartesian-product of the seed words (2048^11). but there are several ways to reduce the search space. first, you can iterate over the combinations (with repetition) of 3..8. if one the combinations is {8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6}, you would have 103^5 + 88^5 + 508^1 combinations of seed words to test (for that combination of word lengths). and then of course you'd need to test the permutations (the ordering) of those seed words.
if you assume that the puzzle contains no duplicate seed words (i'm guessing that's a 50% chance), you would be dealing with factorials instead of exponentials, so the search space would be greatly reduced.
as for speed, i'm able to test 3 M seeds/s/core. and that's using perl- a dynamic language. but even if i switched to a compiled language, the search space is still too large to solve it in a reasonable time frame.

maybe before you give the last word, you give some hints to shrink the search space a bit, like the length of the last word, the first letter, etc. that would keep this going a bit longer.
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:19:17
it took longer for the transaction to confirm than it did to solve after the last hint was given. i wrote a script in 10 minutes and only had to test 45 words before stumbling upon the correct one: `manned`.

after googling the hint words, i found a wordlist containing them all that had 60K words. using the length of the last word, the list shrank to 7K. my script shuffled the wordlist before testing, so i was indeed lucky that i only had to test 45 words. i had to test all word permutations (6!) * 10 digits * 45. it took about 3 hours.
@_date: 2018-11-09 15:25:12
if the wordlist isn't shared, then it's sort of unfair, since it's a matter of luck which to pick.
here's another idea for a challenge: if you use bip38 with non-ec  multiply mode, you can encrypt a known mnemonic. so you could have two paths to the same prize. give more hints for the passphrase of the encrypted key and less for the mnemonic words of the unencrypted key and see which path wins.

since `bounded` isn't in the bip39 wordlist, we'll have to look at larger wordlists, like the standard /usr/share/dict/words, which has 100K+ words. a better first clue would have been the total character length of the password.

this is obvious. i was asking if it's possible to claim the CLAMs associated with the bitcoin address, without needing to expose the private key to anything or anybody. where in the source is it making use of the bitcoin private key to get access to the CLAMs? if we can find that we might be able to figure out how to claim without needing to expose our bitcoin keys.

not looking forward to 0.12 since they're planning on removing support for priority in the fee calculations, so you won't be able to send free transactions anymore

wtf! he's trying to draw more people to the site (see his top-level site now), but still not updating the games.
