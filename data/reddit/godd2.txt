That's what we mean when we say spending and saving are mutually exclusive.

Some in the Bitcoin community have this idea that what the Fed creates are counterfeit bills, since they don't have the legitimate authority to have a monopoly on currency creation, or some other weak reason.  For what it's worth, I agree with you that counterfeit means someone *else* made it and said that the Fed made it.  Counterfeiting is when you put someone else's brand on your work without their permission, so the Fed is incapable of counterfeiting their own bills.

I've answered this elsewhere, but I'll copy it here again, because I like to say the word multidigraph.
A bitcoin is a [normalizing]( [scalar multiple]( of a [node]( on a [multidigraph]( whose edges have unique identity.  As pointed out, it's more like you *control* a bitcoin, and this would mean you control a particular node on the multidigraph (i.e. an address on the blockchain).  You "own" the power to change the scalar multiple value of that node (move bitcoins from one address to another).  People are willing to pay a certain amount to have that power.  That cost is approximated/represented by the spot price of a bitcoin.  Everyone wants a piece of the action because the consensus of the blockchain is valuable for various reasons.

That doesn't justify the activity.  Perhaps the activity shouldn't be done in the first place.  The onus isn't on a victim to leave, it's on the perpetrator to stop.

They're in the other tokens.  Next years tokens are worth more, so you don't need as many to pay the same bill.
As I said, just because the characters in the hypothetical make the mistake that a token is worth the same one year to the next doesn't mean that it's impossible to pay back the debts.
Worded slightly differently, the entire issue evaporates.  If the contract said "5 apples worth of tokens" rather than 11 tokens, then even if there is only one apple in that economy at the end of the year, everyone can pay their bill.  Further, if the wording simply said "11 2015-tokens' worth of 2014-tokens", it is now clear that it's not necessarily impossible to pay all the bills, since each token can have risen in value over the course of the year.

Why would he say it's not possible to have 11 tokens by the end of the year? 1 Year N token isn't necessarily the same as 1 Year N+1 token, and if the ration is 1:1.1 then it's possible for everyone to have 11 Year N tokens by Year N+1.  Whether or not the fictional characters in this story make that mistake is irrelevant.  The fact of the matter is that those semantics, when properly fleshed out, yield an opposite answer to his thought experiment.
Does this dismantle the rest of his talk?  I don't know, I haven't watched it yet, but so far I don't have high hopes.

*Only if they make the same mistake* of thinking that tokens are static in value over time.  I'm saying if they didn't make that mistake, then they wouldn't have made such a ridiculous agreement to begin with.

@_date: 2015-01-08 05:09:38
I admitted several times that the characters in the story made the mistake in believing that tokens are worth some static amount over time.
I'm pointing out that the hypothetical is a faulty analogy and a red herring.
That is, it doesn't matter what some mistaken fictional characters believe about loans and currency, that doesn't make it true about fiat currency.


And I'm claiming that he didn't properly define what a "token" was, so you don't get to claim some definition in the general.  If you want to claim some particular definition, then specify it, but you don't get both "the physical tokens themselves" *and* "the value that each token represents" at the same time.  That's the mistake.

That's not a good enough analogy.  If the prosecution waved a letter that Ulbricht signed saying he was DPR, it would *not* be hearsay because the contents of the letter are provative.  If the letter claimed that Ulbricht was *not* DPR, then it *would* be hearsay.
Using the interview to get DHS to admit that it was a reason to suspect Karpeles would not be hearsay for a different reason.  The statements wouldn't be put forth for their truth.

This won't happen overnight, and it won't happen in America (unless, like every Federal Reserve Bank literally explodes or something insane).
But what Bitcoin needs from developed nations are those initial investments to make the network available to others seeking it as an alternative when they need it.

They haven't been lost forever.  They've been allocated to public/private key pairs which were generated randomly with [ECDSA]( and then lost.
In the future, we'll be able to generate new key pairs so quickly, that we'll find the ones that are currently lost.
At that point, we'll have adopted a new way to (difficultly) generate new keys (ECDSA_2.0?), and the same thing can happen over again.
If you need an analogy, its like a big ocean, and each square foot at the bottom of the ocean is an account (key pair).  Right now, we can only generate accounts ("randomly") so quickly, so we can only search the bottom of that ocean so fast.  Later, we'll have the technology to search the bottom of the ocean more quickly, but to prevent someone from finding accounts that actively belong to someone else, they're going to move their bitcoins over to a much larger ocean that won't be efficiently searchable for a long time (at least, long enough to move the bitcoins to an even bigger ocean).
TL;DR: we'll be able to bruteforce key pairs in the future to have access to old wallets.

While the monetary base is one factor in the size of the money supply of a FRB system, another factor is the (average) reserve ratio (different banks can have different ratios).  As long as the reserve ratio changes to keep up with the deflation of the monetary base, you will have zero inflation in the money supply.
A market in which banks are allowed to freely respond to the supply and demand for currency (by changing their reserve ratios at will) will probably get pretty close to this optimal point.
@_date: 2012-08-18 07:32:03
You're not off base, but you don't need to do that to find "lost bitcoins".  Since the bitcoins currently lost are allocated to key pairs generated with [ECDSA]( we'll be able to generate those key pairs so fast in the future, we'll find "previously lost" coins.  And then move those bitcoins over to some newer key pair generation number thingy.
@_date: 2012-02-02 10:47:42
I don't think Bitcoin itself will be a currency.  I can only see Bitcoin as being a reserve on which an FRB currency is based.  Eventually market growth will need a currency that doesn't inflate or deflate too much.  People feel safe when one unit of their currency has the same use one year as it does the next.  To appeal to a majority, a currency can't deflate like Bitcoin inevitably will (unless we stop creating as much wealth, which is doubtful due to hundreds of years of consistent economic growth).

But making the drugs illegal only makes it easier for those dealers to get business.
Although I will say that there are more than two options (full legalization and complete prohibition).  In Portugal, personal use is legal, but dealing is still illegal.
However, I'd say that it would be less harmful to the broken, addicted person to buy a harmful drug from a store than from a dealer. (cleaner drug production, more recourse for suing bad drug sellers, less drug related gang crime, etc.)

@_date: 2011-07-22 22:45:31
That's true, but it seems that you're still only paying attention to one component of the value calculation.  The total value (**T**) is its value as a medium of exchange (**M**), plus the value of the network's alternative uses (**A**).  So, if you will, **T** = **M** + **A** .  It is true that **T** has increased due to the fact that more people went out and got computer equipment.  But this is only because **M** has increased.  The **A** part is still the same, and would have remained the same had the computer parts been sitting in a warehouse somewhere.
While it may be useful for us to only think about **M**, and even though it seems consistent to do so with how **T** is acting, the theoretical approach *must* take into account the size of **A**, even if **A** remains constant.
@_date: 2011-05-21 02:53:58
This is always a fun debate.  I'll quote form the article to poke holes in his arguments.


The process of earning Bitcoins for completing a block is not analogous to a central banking authority whimsically giving money to random individuals. (Also, this is PRECISELY what the mint did in 1849 when people spent their time and energy mining gold and getting paper money from the mint)


Neither dose an individual who completes a block.  Their computations cost them time/money/energy, and the benefit to the network as a whole is that BitCoin is more secure the more honest nodes there are.


This is the same as gold-backed currency (like the dollar you seem to be touting).  The only difference is that no one is in control of currency creation (then again, no one is in control of how much gold is in the Earth).


To answer his last question, the solution has already occurred.  There now exist large mining "pools" where you can contribute calculations with your bitcoin client, and you get a share of the proceeds in a more steady rate over time.  (instead of having to wait to finish one block in a matter of years, you can get .01123127 BTC per day)


Answer: Financial behaviors are (and should be) up to the individual.  People will spend money when they need/want things more than they want the money they have.  Haven't you ever heard of supply and demand?  And you're lecturing *us* on 'basic economics'?


As deflation occurs, people won't 'spend less', they will use fewer Bitcoins for the same things they are doing every day.
If tomorrow you woke up, and there were half as many dollars in the world, AND everyone owned half as many as they did the day before (in some magical way), here's what will happen:
The McDonald's dollar menu will become the 50-cent menu.
Each of your dollars is worth twice as much, and you aren't willing to spend as much to buy the same things you enjoy (maybe you don't enjoy McDonalds, but it's just an example).
Since BitCoins are *very very* divisible, predictable, long term deflation doesn't make this a 'non-viable' currency.

I can see why this mode of thinking may be reasonable when only considering Bitcoin.  But from a general theoretical economic perspective, we would be forced to represent "Bitcoin"'s value in terms (partially) of it's opportunity cost.  The only way to do this is to ascribe value to the computers which make up the network.
When you say "The network's use in maintaining bitcoin", you're only considering it as a medium of exchange and of the network only as it pertains to Bitcoin.
So the theoretical version ought to say "Bitcoin's pricing is an amalgam of its use as a medium of exchange and of *whatever else the network could be doing that's also useful*."

Gold can just sit there while being used.  But the Bitcoin network of processors *must be in use* for bitcoins to be usable.  Those computers could be doing something else just like the gold itself could be doing something else.

When Mises points out that a money comes to be from two partial demands (a demand for a medium of exchange and a demand for the use of the good itself), is it not the case that Bitcoin follows this pattern?
Certainly the electricity that goes into making bitcoins and the computers being used at the time have demand in and of themselves.  And we all see the demand for Bitcoin as a medium of exchange.
I'm not sure I see how this is a counterexample to the Regression Theorem.  (Although, I must admit I don't know the regression theorem very well)

I would say this requires a misleading understanding of what Bitcoin ***is***.
If we understand Bitcoin to be the very network on which it is running, then Bitcoin most certainly "can be used for a myriad of purposes", as you so eloquently pointed out.
I would also say that it is (unintentionally) misleading to ask "What is **a** Bitcoin?"  The better question is "What is Bitcoin?"  And the answer to the second is "It is a computer network being used for a particular purpose in a particular way."
If we agree that Bitcoin is that very network, then it would seem my comparison is valid.

If a great number of people hoard their bitcoins, people will trade with fewer of them.  It is easy to see the velocity of this currency since all transaction are public.

I would argue that the "trade of bitcoins" is merely a facade of understanding wrapped around the reality that all that is occurring is that a bunch of computers are spending their time doing math.
As such, the only reason "a bitcoin" exists is because the network's existence allows us to understand and explain it in such a manner.
And since the only reality is that network, and since networks have alternative uses (just like gold has alternative uses), I fail to see how my analogy to gold does not hold.
Is gold pricing not an amalgam of gold's use as a medium of exchange and of it's alternative uses?
As an analogy, is Bitcoin's pricing not an amalgam of its use as a medium of exchange and of the network's alternative uses?

Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. Same goes for deflation.
When people say "Bitcoin is deflationary", they aren't talking about the next 30 days, they're talking about the next 30 *years*.
After 25 years, the increase in supply in Bitcoin will be lower than the average increase in real annual economic growth.  Hence deflation.

That's not what inflation is.
Inflation occurs when too many units of currency are chasing too few goods.
Regardless of who is using the currency, if the production is 0, then deflation will occur since goods and services will still be produced.
If today there is 1 million Dollars in the world and the only goods were 1 million bananas, and tomorrow there were 1 million Dollars still, but 2 million bananas, then 50% deflation occurred over that day (cause each dollar is now chasing two bananas instead of just one banana). You might be tempted to say that each banana is now "worth" 50 cents, but don't let that terminology cloud your understanding of what's going on in an inflationary aspect.
Inflation isn't prices going up or going down. It's the amount of currency relative to the amount of goods and services.

This has all the pitfalls of Bitcoin.
You need a distributed P2P crypto-currency that connects (by direct proportion) the marginal supply of currency and the marginal demand by some non-zero factor.
The marginal supply of Solidcoin approaches zero just like Bitcoin, but the marginal demand for each currency will increase.


All I can see this doing is promoting one of two behaviors (after all of the Solidcoins are created).
A) people will transact 'off the books' (imagine a Solidcoin "bank" that has a lot of people's money.  A simple ledger-to-ledger transaction would avoid p2p transaction fees)
B) people would get together and make transactions as a conglomerate.
Either of these things will result in a lack of incentive to create hashes.

You are correct that Bitcoin is a commodity.
However, it is also a currency.  More often than not, currencies are commodities.  The thing about Bitcoin is that it has no alternative uses, so its use as a currency is supreme.
Gold, silver, wheat, oil, all have other uses (even if small).
Bitcoin's lack of alternative uses relieves the distinction between its being a commodity and a currency.
tl;dr : Since it's not used for anything else, it's super-convenient to call it a currency.

Part of the price of gold is due to its alternative uses (in science, engineering, etc.).  If I were to buy an ounce of gold, those things don't matter to me when I'm looking at the price, but they most certainly affect the price.

Ah, but the difficulty is lower, which means all that computing power can now finish blocks in 8.427 minutes.  That's ~170.88 blocks finished per day to the normal 144.  25% of ~170.88 is ~42.72 blocks, so the expected income is *that* times 25 BTC per block which is (my apologies) ~1,068.00 BTC (not the aforementioned 1110 which was made multiplying by 26%).  As you can see, honest mining means more blocks get finished per day.  A smaller portion of a bigger pie ends up being bigger than a larger portion of a smaller pie.

This is about expected income, not completed blocks.  The difficulty is irrelevant for my calculations.  The difficulty could be 1 and it wouldn't matter (there would be other problems if that were the case, but it wouldn't be due to selfish behavior).  Honest behavior would still yield a higher expected income than selfish behavior.

Also, draft up a receipt signable by both parties before cash changes hands.
Something like "On this day the 31st of August, 2013 I &lt;your name here&gt; did sell to &lt;their name here&gt; a total of &lt;bitcoin amount here&gt; BTC at the agreed-upon exchange rate of &lt;exchange rate here&gt; USD/BTC for the aggreed upon total of &lt;dollar amount here&gt; USD."
Offer to show them your ID and ask to see theirs, as this protects BOTH parties (this is to match the written signature to the name).  Either one of you could get away with theft if the contract/receipt and IDs aren't shown simply because of the ignorance of law enforcement.  If you send over the BTC and they don't hand over the cash, what would you tell the cops?  If they give you the cash, and you don't send the BTC, what are *they* going to tell the cops?

That's not what ownership is.  An owner is one who is in rightful possession.  Wrongful possession does not make one an owner of something.  So, just because I have the power to transfer the transferability of some sum of bitcoins does not make me the owner of those bitcoins.


And fungibility can be restored by the use of a mixing service.  I'm not claiming this is right, but it is something that can be done, so my suggestions that not all coins are owned by the one who controls their private key does not destroy bitcoin fungibility, at least, not for good.

Bitcoinity is showing the sum of all the currencies that MtGox trades in.  bitcoinwatch.org on the other hand shows those currencies separately.  So while it may look like btcchina has a 24hr volume of 14K BTC, and MtGox USD sales add up to only 12.6K BTC, that doesn't tell the whole story.  Btcchina only trades in BTC &lt;-&gt; CNY (Chinese Yuan), but MtGox trades AUD, CAD, CHF, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, NZD, PLN, RUB, SEK, SGD, THB, and USD to BTC.

You could easily have commercial, private, voluntary financial institutions which allow for ledger-to-ledger transactions between patrons of the institution or between patrons of collaborating institutions to handle volume of that sort.
The customers would merely be paying for Bitcoin storage, security, and convenience.  Or you could keep your Bitcoins all yourself and bear the cost of transaction time.  OR you could put forth some of your Bitcoins in an escrow-type account ready for transacting but keep most to yourself.

Bitcoin solves the trust problem of your money being sound and transactions being verifiable in a trust-less manner.  It did not solve the problem of trusting the people you actually transact with and buy things from.  However, Bitcoin does stand to mitigate the problem of new-merchant trust with [the way you can draft contracts](  It's built right into the protocol and implemented in the current blockchain.  I just can't wait for more clever contracts to be concocted in the coming years to mitigate other trust-based financial services.

This isn't exactly true.  The difficulty goes up to what it should be for the last 2016 blocks to take 10 minutes on average.  It assumes that the computing power on the network will remain constant for the next 2016 blocks.

I think you have a misconception on what the relationship between ECDSA being broken and Bitcoin is/would be.  If ECDSA were ever "broken" (i.e. You could brute force a private key faster than I could make a new one), It would have been known for some time that that is possible, and over time the brute forcing simply gets more efficient.
No one is going to wake up one day and magically live in a world were Quantum Computers can brute force keys in seconds where the day before, that was unheard of.
The amount of time it would take for those methods to become efficient are much more than enough to hard fork the block chain.

Koooooj, your program makes the same mistake the paper made.  Even if the malicious miner takes more of the bitcoins that happened to be mined, they are causing so many fewer to be mined that their expected income decreases.  A selfish miner would expect to follow a strategy which optimizes their income.
The difficulty changing doesn't affect the unviability of the strategy.  25% is still 25%.  Yes, the same computing power of a lower difficulty is an easier task, but everyone else has all the same computing power they had before, so after the difficulty decreases, the correct strategy is still to be honest.
tl;dr: Being honest (that is, not doing "Selfish Mining") *regardless of the difficulty* yields a higher expected income.
**The difficulty does not matter.**

This is true.  It's because over time, computing power is added to the network, but the addition isn't compensated for.
The difficulty changes every 2016 blocks.  The new difficulty is the result of a calculation.  The calculation takes how long the 2016 blocks took to make and compares that number to how long they SHOULD take if they're taking 10 minutes each.
So let's say one day a bunch of computers were dumped on the network and this period of difficulty had an average block completion time of 9 minutes.  Well at the end of that 2016-block period, the network will see that it only took 12.6 days instead of the full 14 days.
So the new difficulty is set so that the next 2016 block will take 14 days to account for the new computing power.
*But it doesn't compensate for that missing 1.4 days (14 - 12.6)*.  If computers keep getting added on each week, then those 1.4 day subtractions start to add up.
"Halving Day" is supposed to happen once every 4 years (every 210,000 blocks).  But the first '4 years' only took 3 years, 10 months, and 25 days, so about 36 days sooner than it was 'supposed' to.
So as long as computing power is added to the network, we will always be shaving off seconds, hours, or even days off of each two week period.

My argument is based on expected income from competing strategies.


Okay, at this point, by being selfish, they could get 936 BTC per day.  On the other hand, at this point, by being honest, they could get ~1110.715 BTC per day.
So being honest still is a better strategy after the difficulty changes.
Even a flip-flop strategy wouldn't work.  That is, 'sabotaging' the network for 2016 blocks until the diff. changes and then being 'honest' for the next 216 blocks, because during their sabotage period, they're throwing away ~369.10 BTC to get an extra ~210.715 BTC per day.

And you want them to be *more* knowledgeable and *more* efficient?
@_date: 2013-02-23 02:07:10
The answer is: **None**.
Even if some private keys were lost by their original owners, computers will eventually be fast enough to generate key pairs to spend those "lost" bitcoins.
By this time, Bitcoin will hopefully have scaled to accept more complex key pair generation algorithms.  More likely, a whole new blockchain will have to be started and there will be rifts, blah blah, but this won't happen for decades.
So, they aren't lost "forever", but the chances the original owner generates the same key pair is slim to none.

A corollary to your argument is that a greater monetary base of Bitcoins is better.  In other words, if more Bitcoins are circulating is a good thing, then more Bitcoins would be one way to achieve that goal.

If you don't want the bitcoins, which is your prerogative ( and I don't blame you), I'm pretty sure he would be forced to pay you in a dollar amount per the divorce papers (or post-divorce papers).  If he wants to use bitcoins, he needs to go sell them and send you the appropriate legal dollar amount to satisfy the court's rendering.  Likewise, he's not able to pay you in metric tons of copper, he'd have to go to a copper exchange or brokerage and sell the copper then give you the appropriate amount in dollars.  He should be eating the cost on his currency risk, not you.  (I say "should" here in a legal sense, not a moral one)

Even if it is an oligopoly, it will dissolve over time.
The people that have the most USD can perpetuate their stake in it by making friends at the Fed and getting favorable legislation, or even possibly more nefariously, straight up favors from the Fed itself.
This structure can't really happen in Bitcoin since no one can create them.
Although the counterargument to this would be that gold is owned primarily by governments, but I would argue that to be a faulty analogy in this case due to the distributed nature of Bitcoin itself.

It would be more accurate to say "1 Bitcoin is worth what $100 is worth."
That base worth is made up by preferences of humans.  There is no "conversion", there is simply a comparison to something more common and understood.
If I had 10,000 yen, I wouldn't have an intuition of what that is 'worth', despite it being an official currency.  It would make sense for me to "convert" it into the equivalent dollar worth to get a feel of what 10,000 is worth.
I would then say "10,000 yen is worth $100" but it would be more accurate to say "10,000 yen is worth what $100 is worth".
This type of 'conversion' is not the problem you're implying it is.

Also, if quantum computers are running around breaking prime number based encryption protocols, Bitcoin failing would be the least of our worries.

One way to interpret this is that as more and more people jump on board Bitcoin, they will abandon their previous mediums (media?) of exchange.  Since the value of a currency is in who will accept it, those currencies will lose value.
Clearly a US Dollar is worth more to an American (on average) than the equivalent in Canadian Dollars because of who will accept the money as payment for goods and services.  But even US dollars are less valuable depending on what they want to buy.  Bitcoin is inherently international.  So it represents a unique property to its users: the ability to pay ANYone with it (sort of like gold) and not worry that they'll have to go through an exchange at some point.
Bitcoin isn't there yet, but every day it grows closer and closer to being a solidified medium of exchange.

It means that the same block had two different solutions within a very small amount of time.  When this happens, there are "two" blockchains until a block is finished on one of the two branches, then everyone gives up on the shorter branch and jumps onto the longer one.  This is the protocol.  It also means that if you completed an "orphaned" block (the one everyone jumped away from), you don't get the 25 BTC reward from it.  But it didn't matter in this case, since both blocks were completed by the same pool, so no one really suffered any loss.

The more distributed computing power -&gt; the more secure Bitcoin is (less vulnerable to a single attacker).  The more secure Bitcoin is -&gt; the more valuable Bitcoin is.
It would be nice to live in a world where this electricity "wasting" wasn't necessary, but unfortunately there are enough assholes in the world such that it is necessary to do this to produce a secure decentralized currency.
Now that I think about it, it doesn't matter how many assholes there are, just that there is some amount of human error in the world.  Then the single attacker isn't an attacker, just a client making a mistake.  So even if humans were all good, the electricity *still* wouldn't be a "waste", as the compounding of security decreases the chances of human error entering the system.

Thats a questionable claim.  If there are no intellectual property rights, what claim do you have to a number?  Sure, you have a claim to the medium upon which it is written/encoded, but the key itself?  I'm not sure that's anywhere near the 'embodiment' of private property rights.

What makes him think that Bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value?  And by intrinsic value here, I mean whatever he seems to mean.  It would appear that he's being quite cavalier on what counts as intrinsic value.  Clearly Bitcoin's value relies on the ongoing maintainence of the blockchain, which requires computation.  That computation is basically electric energy.
So why can't we just say that Bitcoin has intrinsic value due to the fact that the computers which compose the network must constantly be running, since he's going to be so lazy with his use of the term "intrinsic value".
Peter, if you're gonna wave your hand and say gold has intrinsic value, then we get to wave our hands too.

Your wallet is simply a list of private keys.
Those private keys can "sign off" on transactions.  If 4 BTC is associated with a key pair, and someone uses the correct private half to sign off on a 3 BTC transaction, the network will assume that it is a legitimate transaction.
When you create an address, you're generating a private/public key pair.  The public one you tell everyone so that you can receive BTC.  But all that's happening when you "receive" is that the network ledger simply associates some number of BTC to your public address.  That's all the blockchain really is, it's a huge public ledger.
Now back to these key pairs.  The public and private keys are mathematically linked, but you can't get the private key if you only have the public one.  However, due to math and stuff, you can prove that you know the private key without revealing the private key.  I apologize for not knowing the details on this small part, but just bear with for a moment.
So if you take your private key (held in a plain text file on your computer) and you encrypt the file, then you're effectively the only person who now has access to the private key (unless someone coaxes your cipher to decrypt the file from you by coercion or seduction).
If you don't encrypt that file, your keys are at risk.  Hypothetically, a virus could transmit that file to some other server, and they would spend your BTC (by proving they know the private key, since they have it), and the network would accept the transaction as legit, and you'd be out some BTC.
Does that help make a bit more sense about the keys pairs?
Let me know if you have any other questions :)

Imagine two worlds.  One where every is an honest miner, and one where 25% are "Selfish Miners".
In the first, honest world, everyone will expect to get the income proportional to their share of the computing power of the network.  For 25%, this expected income is 900 BTC per day.
In the second world, the Selfish Miners are constantly sabotaging the network every time they finish a block first, in order to cause a fork.  In a strategy where they only do this for one block length, their expected daily income drops to around 530 BTC per day.
Now you might say "wait, this assumes that the average time for an honest block is 10 minutes, and the extra time above the ten minutes causes them to lose money.  But what about when the difficulty lowers?  Wouldn't their expected income go higher than normal?"
Well, let's explore that.
In that first world, everything is hunky dory and you still expect 900 BTC per day which gives a 4 week total adding up to  25,200 BTC.
In world two, we have to break it up into two worlds.  World A is one where the selfish miners decide their sabotaging days are over, and go back to honest mining.  World B is where they continue to be hooligans and keep on being selfish.
So, what happens?
In world A, the average block now takes about 8 minutes 25 seconds, and they can finish 25% of them which gives them a daily expected income of around 1068 BTC (higher than before, whoa!) and adds up to a 4 week total of around 21,420 BTC which is approximately 3,779.9 BTC lower than world 1, that world where everyone is honest.
In world B, the average block now takes 10 minutes, and they have a daily expected income of 630 BTC and that adds up to a 4 week total of around 15,993 BTC which is a HUGE drop from 25,200.
It is clear here that honest mining is preferable to either selfish strategy.

The larger your share of the network is, the more you hurt yourself, since you're cause a bigger split of the same difficulty.  As for the three extra minutes, it's because the other 75% of the network only has 75% of the computing power, and since the 25% has effectively taken themselves off the network by making a private chain, the 75% have to do extra work to finish a block at the same difficulty, 33.3...% extra, to be precise.

If you personally don't like Bitcoin then, a) what are you doing posting here, and b) don't use Bitcoin.
I don't mind if you have contentions with Bitcoin and want to lay out your complaints about it in this subreddit, but if you don't like it personally (i.e., you'd personally rather not use it), that's what I mean by "why are you posting here".

In as much as there is a difference between a cat and a mammal.

Nah, you want Bitcoins chasing goods if your goal is investment.  A speculation-based market is inherently volatile and not good grounds for long term investment.

This is beautiful rhetoric (that's meant as a compliment).
If people can tie the currency to something real like that, its a very powerful message.  You're doing much more than feeding homeless people, you're laying the foundation for anyone anywhere to help people in need no matter where they are.

There is a bit of loss in people pouring computing power into the orphaned chain.  It's not that much, since orphaned blocks happen about 1% of the time, but it's still a small loss.

For those not in on the joke, MtGOX originally stood for "Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange" and the Black Lotus is a famous Magic: The Gathering card.

But his point still stands that it's in the hitman's best interest to get rid of the body, moreso than it is the payer's best interest.

No, DDoS is aggression.  Aggression need not be violent.

This sounds contradictory to me.

That is actually an excellent idea.  I think I'll go make a print-outable image that people can put up around town.

Okay, but they don't have 21% of the computing power of the network.

You see, there are these things called "jokes".  It's when you make a funny and people laugh, but I guess you wouldn't know anything about that...

Haha, sucker, I have ten times the Bitcoin you do!

Well he still believes that the vast majority of the price of a bitcoin is sue to speculative value, and speculative value isn't known to drop in volatility.

I, too, wish to live in a world where no one believes theft is ever legitimate.

lol, I've always said "Bitcoin will go the way of Qwerty".
@_date: 2013-02-19 14:52:09
I dont know what you mean by "makes it ok".  It wasnt wrong to begin with.  A justification isnt necessary.

People like me?  You mean people in favor of explicit voluntary exchange?
I don't know why you're judging me for holding the opinion that it's BS that there's some unsaid and unwritten agreement between me and that person which is inconsistent with anything else like it.  Are you mad that I don't tip fast food workers?
I mean, feel free to judge away, but do note that in California here, the worker gets minimum wage no matter what.  Not that "the employer pays the difference" stuff.  No, they get minimum wage, and then get to keep their tips minus the amount the government steals from those tips.
If you want to go hating and judging, why not focus your attention on the thieves in Washington?
