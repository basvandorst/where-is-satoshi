Not only does the US not go hard against corruption, there are legal avenues which specifically condone corruption. Hidden corporate authorship of parts of the TPP? Completely legal. Congressional insider trading? Completely legal. Paid lobbying? Legal. Direct corporate political contributions? Legal, up to a certain point. "Non coordinating" Super Pacs funding your political career? Nearly legal, and impossible to enforce. Guaranteed overvalued consulting career after politics by your corporate sponsorship? Why not?

Special interest groups have definitely had their losses. Not sure what you are referring to here.
@_date: 2014-10-29 00:31:30
but other currencies and popular tradeables like gold have predictable reactions to us market slides, why not bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:32:56
Has someone broken bitcoin? Or are these exchanges just incompetent? Both bitcoin and bitstamp reporting the same errors at about the same time - accounts and transactions are not balancing. Are transactions being feigned by nodes?
@_date: 2014-10-29 01:23:56
well less of a reaction and more of a tandem movement related to the same factors that cause changes in the us market.

If the bitcoin market doesn't become MORE liquid, that speaks volumes about the lack of uptake of bitcoin as a currency.

I feel like recent "good" bitcoin news has been around commercial adoption. When newegg started taking bitcoin, what happened? People sitting on bitcoin, spent their btc on computer shit, and bitpay sold the btc back to the market, increasing btc supply. Same thing when any new business adopts bitcoin unless they start saving it.

they probably didn't respond though. I sent them an email 6 days ago because of an error with the bitcoindeal promo, which a newegg rep then misinformed me about and fucked up my order. Still haven't heard anything.

not direct access, but force was already stealing bitcoin from ross. has it been ruled out that force has remote access to his account at the time?
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:31:31
How does that rule out the possibility that his computer or account had been compromised?
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:28:58
it sounds like the Ulbricht's defense knew about Force's corruption and were only sitting on it because the judge prohibited the defense from using Force's corruption as evidence in trial. If this is the case, while sketchy as fuck from the outside, it might have been done legally. If that is the case, I doubt it will go back to court on appeal.
Either way, how would the defense make this argument if they were not allowed to bring up Force in trial?
This is a fuckton deep in speculation.

I don't understand. Why can't lavabit just host in a different country?

In terms of expected values, slushs pool would earn what percentage less that eligius?
@_date: 2013-09-25 04:08:35
do you know how this compares to slush's pool? or BTCGUILD? It seems like everyone else is recommending BTCGUILD, and I have one friend who uses slush pool, but how do I compare. I'm just looking for greatest expected returns for the ~9 months I might be running the miner

So if I were to setup the asic on elgius with BFGMiner, what settings would I use -etc how would I set it up.  The elgius site seems nonresponsive right now
@_date: 2013-08-14 14:45:58
So with lavabit, in order to decrypt the users messages, you would have to intercept the user's password, where is with spideroak, you have to intercept the user's encryption key? How is this any different? The password is being used as a key.

If she broke up with you for buying $3000 in btc with your own money, sounds like your relationship issues went deeper than bitcoin. It might not have been a mistake for either of you. Otherwise, if you have spent her money on it - I could still see reason to be upset regardless of what you made.
@_date: 2013-08-14 14:27:24
Yeah apparently the government has assumed we have no expectation of privacy when storing information with private companies regardless of how much effort we go to in order to maintain privacy. its a joke.

I just posted my order for 3 minirigs. Hope they get here soon.
@_date: 2013-08-14 14:25:50
Same idea as lavabit. See what happened there
@_date: 2013-08-08 14:35:08
This isn't exactly true... Over the long run, coins are released at the same rate -2016 blocks every two weeks - however, for short periods of time, this is not true. Mining returns are based on difficulty, which is re targeted every 2016 blocks, not immediately. So say, total network hash output doubled instantaneously after a new retarget - All 2016 blocks would be mined in about 1 week, rather than the targeted 2 weeks. 
In another situation, assume the price of bitcoin crashes soon after a retarget, making mining unprofitable for many users. Total network hash output drops by a factor of 10 because most people stop mining. Now, it will take 10 times as long to mine those 2016 blocks, and difficulty won't adjust until all are mined. This means ~20 weeks to mine the same number of bitcoin that is generally mined in about 2 weeks.

bfl_josh has recently been quoting as saying that he doubts they have even half of a forum user's estimated 50,000 orders. Meaning at most 20,000 orders. I feel like most people ordering multiple jalas would have just gotten the singles etc, but who knows. I seriously doubt 57,000 jalapenos

This makes it sound as if people mining with elgius did not get paid as expected. I'm not sure what your take is on that
@_date: 2013-09-26 13:00:52
how long between mining and deposits?
@_date: 2013-09-25 02:16:18
what are shelved shares and LIFO? sounds slightly like pyramid scheme, but what do you mean?
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:24:01
Sounds like a bitch. Could just be financially conservative though. If you spent $3000 on bitcoin and that was all you add, still on overall questionable decision. Only hindsight is 20/20.
