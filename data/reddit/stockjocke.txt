I had to read that twice to make sure I saw it right.
I believe that the Almighty Sphaggeti Monster created the world with his noodly appendage. I believe this is the absolute and unquestionable truth, so therefor I will teach this to my children, regardless of how wrong it is. 
Does that sound right to you?

There was no need to dig deeper, it is pretty clear what they are trying to do.
The price has since collapsed back to where it was before the pump.
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:17:10
Fair enough, but the point I was making is that just because some political entity accepts bitcoin, does not mean they are worthy of receiving it.

I admire their moxy and aggressiveness to quickly reverse merge and get themselves this free press, but at the end of the day, they are just an online store that is selling things for bitcoin.
Any online retailer can click a button and accept bitcoin.

Reverse merger ELI5:
When a company wants to go public, it can do so through an IPO or a reverse merger.
You have probably heard of IPO's, but they are expensive and can take 9 months to over a year to plan and execute.
A reverse merger is when a company finds a publicly traded shell that has little or no business in it. They buy out the shell, scoop out the rotting inner guts and put their shiny new stuff inside that publicly traded company.
Bitcoinshop.us is one of many small cap companies that will be running to pull this trick and try get themselves a piece of the bitcoin action. 
As you can see, the trading activity soared on news that this transaction took place. There are plenty of traders in the markets that are looking for anything bitcoin related, and bitcoinshop.us just gave them something to buy.
This was the plan naturally, now the question is:  How far can this go?
Some of these reverse mergers will be legit and the companies will have potential, but be warned, many will be scams.
You have seen pump and dumps in the altcoins, but boy, you are in for a treat to see how pump and dumps happen in the stock market!

Two issues worth noting here is that 1) bring pro crypto should no longer be seen as being anti-government. We all want mass acceptance of bitcoin, and for that to happen we need lawmakers on our side, not the other way around.
2) If Stockman was anti-government, he would not be running for office. Republicans always run on the platform of tighter policies and less government, but they never deliver.

@_date: 2013-12-18 02:48:45
No, I am not interested talking about trading, but rather the ecosystem that has evolved to trick others into buying stocks based on fluff.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:18:10
That would raise a lot of red flags within current financial institutions about knowing your client and the source of their funds.
It also goes against the original premise of bitcoin to be an alternate to the current banking system.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:04:34
Bitcoin is completely vulnerable because there are zero regulations!
In the stock markets we have FINRA, SEC and a whole other bunch of acronyms constantly making, adjusting and enforcing rules to prevent things like the flash crash of 2010 from happening again.
Nobody is anonymous in the stock market, if an algo goes wild, which they occasionally do, somebody is getting fined or fired.
In bitcoin land it is the wild west, we have no regulatory body. 
If one of these algo guys set up shop and unleashed some predatory algo on the bitcoin market, there is very little we can do. There are also no repurcussions for him because he is relatively anonymous.
The saving grace we have is that due to the small market cap of bitcoin and the fact that you can not effectively short bitcoin, there is not much incentive to crash it unless you are trying to shake the tree and  buy it really low when everybody panics, which is completely plausible and one of my predictions for 2014.

Yes, on $3000 worth of buying.
This is a pump and dump, read my previous comment.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:23:57
I have no doubt they are smart, but you tell me how this looks?
Obscure lower tier exchange, empty shell of a company, no liquidity, low float, insiders hold majority of the shares, its all bare bones just looking for a catalyst.
If Im wrong, I will make a formal apology, but even you have to admit that this does look like the old Bre-X plays.. assuming you were around for those.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:01:25
Instead of talking public and private keys, talk about holding a cheque book.
You have cheques, you have to sign them over and endorse them.

WSJ did not print it, they just carry press releases from the wire service that this company used to issue this release.
I can send out a press release that will be on WSJ too, its about $300.

Hey! I have an economics degree!
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:25:38
Im very bullish on bitcoin and the technology behind it, but I have seen this story play out in the stock market in the past.
The stage and the players are different, but act is the same.
FINRA, DOJ, FBI or the SEC and which ever other agency gets nominated to deal with bitcoin will make their move within the first half of 2014.
Do you think the FBI is sitting around twiddling its thumbs while all these gambling "dice" sites keep popping up all over the place?
It will happen, there will be a mess, but it will be a good thing for the long term health of bitcoin.
Bitcoin may have start as a libertarians dream, but to make it mainstream there will be some growing pains.

News and events happen so fast, and people react so quickly, its impossible to get it right 100% of the time.

They are a bit late... but we call it the Magazine Cover Indicator in the stock market world.
Its not necessarily a good thing  in the short term.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:09:11
What is wrong with you people?
You complain about pump and dumps, but then you upvote this, which is a penny stock that trades on the Canadian Venture Exchange, which is where garbage goes to die.
Their worthless, dead, hardly trading stock has now had a +150% jump and insiders are happily dumping on all the new buyers.
Good work on showing the penny stock industry how to bring attention to themselves.


Yes, its called promotional pump and dump BS.
We should not be promoting, upvoting or supporting these kind of actions.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:51:55


Me too.
If anybody here wants bitcoin to go mainstream, this guy is not the kind of person you want waving the banner.
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:21:01
The stock market has always been regulated to some extent, the difference being that regulations and rules got tighter.
For example a circuit breaker was introduced that if the market drops x%, everything gets halted.
Eg for the NYSE:


A 1,450-point drop in the DJIA before 2 p.m. will halt trading for one hour; for 30 minutes if between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.; and have no effect if at 2:30 p.m. or later unless there is a level 2 halt.
 


A 2,900-point drop in the DJIA before 1:00 p.m. will halt trading for two hours; for one hour if between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m.; and for the remainder of the day if at 2:00 p.m. or later.
 


A 4,350-point drop will halt trading for the remainder of the day regardless of when the decline occurs.
There are no such circuit breakers for bitcoins, it could essentially drop to zero if all the bids are pulled. That would panic the most sophisticated of traders here.

That is really the driver here.
BTC at $5? Why bother.
BTC at $1000? Yes, now there is something interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:53:01
They dont have to meddle with the price.
All the banking industry needs to do is send a lobbyist over to DC and tell them to halt all USD to BTC transactions at American exchanges while they "create an advisory committee to study the potential threats of Bitcoin", which can take months and months.
That will be enough to spook lots of the fresh money that has arrived over the past few months.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:03:01
Do you think they actually spent time to dig a bit deeper to see what this is?
I can identify this stuff right away, but if you do not have experience in the stock market, it just looks like a great press release from some company that has publicly traded shares! Woohoo!
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:51:18
Nicely made, but a few things bother me:
1:18 - Bitcoin has become the most valuable currency in the world?
What? How? 
1:50 - The longer the hold bitcoin, the less things will cost you? 
Really? Don't get me wrong, Im bullish on BTC, but nobody can accurately predict what the price will be in 5yrs from now.
It could be $0.01, or it could be $40,000. This video makes it sound as if its a sure thing and you can never lose.
Other than that, I like it!

It is impossible to fully explain the concepts and potential without actually using it. 
We did not want to start pulling out cell phones in the middle of dinner, but sending a few cents over to the other person solidifies the story  into something practical they can see.

I used to be a penny stock promoter in the late 90's... I can tell you how they operate.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:51:16
Yes, there is some validity to what he is saying.
Guys like him make a living looking for ways to squeeze a few points from any way possible.
Im pretty sure the algo's that have plagued the stock market are going to make their way here, if they are not already here.
With zero regulation, this is potentially a very dangerous situation.


Oh yes... they will for sure. We already had the stock market flash crash in 2010 which many of us immediately blamed on algos. The SEC went on a long investigation and five months later told us what we already knew.

Last year they did not have thousands of vendors and stores accepting bitcoin, it was a non-issue.
Now suddenly its all over the news every single day and hundreds of thousands new wallets are being opened. 
We are not past the point, if anything, we are closer to that point than ever before.

In the show "The Wire" , Omar made his living by stealing from the drug dealers.
The dealers we so afraid of him that when they saw him coming, they would throw their drugs out the window and run away.
One morning Omar just went out to get smokes or something, as he was have a smoke outside a building, a bag of drugs falls at his feet. The dealers inside the building thought he was coming from them.

Its summarized pretty well in a few of the posts made here already.
1) Explaining the creation of bitcoins using the basketball metaphor. The "creating bitcoins out of thin air" was a big issue for most, it made no sense that something is generated from nothing, but the money in your wallet is the same thing.
2) Explaining public and private keys using the diamond in the box metaphor
3) Explaining the ease of transferring peer to peer, bypassing the middle man and saving on costs.
4) Safety, cold storage, online wallets, and exchanges.

While I can understand and sympathize with the millions of Chinese bitcoin fans, this is actually very bad for the  reputation of bitcoin.
It will just give media an opportunity to vilify those that use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:20:34
A deflationary currency does not need to be volatile, its just that bitcoin is in the early stages of price discovery.
If bitcoin is around 5yrs from now, it should trade like most other mature commodities.
