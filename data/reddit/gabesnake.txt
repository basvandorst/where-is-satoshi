Korea/Japan is about to wake up and they are going to be angry

All could be answered by more reading though. You'll get more patience over here if you'd rather discuss:

Honestly probably not enough to matter in the long run for you. If I had to guess I would say rise to 9kish and then a retreat maybe back to mid 8's. But that's just my estimate 
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:16:20
Not so much of a technical prediction but looking at the buy orders on most exchanges at 8500 and the overall confidence / new investors since the dip, that is my feeling
Edit: hmmm must be getting downvotes by people who shorted :D

It is probably just Chinese trying to stock up on cheap(er) btc since they know the incoming news
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:43:56
Wouldn't it just cost less BTC then for ShitCoinX? Therefore ShitCoinX is valued in a lower BTC value than .001?

My emotions say no, my logic has made me tether up :/ 
Although personally I think no lower than 6, with a much sharper rise back up
Edit: 7

Korea wakes up in about 2.5 hours
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:52:01
Until we bounce off of 8.5k - calling it

Wrong $9
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:48:14
I will venture to say that is another bullish indicator :D 
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:51:25
Korea is waking up and they might be hungry this time
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:36:48
Once Korea wakes up they will eat it for breakfast with their rice
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:04:17
Bottom confirmed 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:56:47
Actually a pretty good indicator 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:25:38
Hey it's the 999 guy
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:05:25
Indeed. Momentum does stop/reverse at some point. People don't realize this when they call for ridiculous things like 1k
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:38:39
Aside from the show Mr Robot... all of their hacking techniques and even the code on the screen is 100% legit ^_^
