Can somebody who used Bitfinex explain how these separated wallets worked?
If every customer had their own wallet, ould you inspect yours on the blockchain and check your balance? Did every trade settle on the blockchain? Unlikely, if not impossible. How and when did leveraged trading settle?
I just don't understand the talk about separated wallets and how just some customers are affected.

It's not about technical capabilties (as long as it's running on a general purpose computing device), it's about culture and making the right things easy.  To get Windows working to have to download binary files from the public Internet for all sorts of drivers (GPU, printer/scanner, etc.) just to be up and running. But hey, it's all transport level encrypted so I'm safe, right?
When things start that way, it feels completely natural that your email software runs code in attachments just by clicking on them because, hey, that's just what you need sometimes. And that documents contain code. Because why not? Let's use the one thing an attacker controls, the file name, to decide what's executable.

It's true, not not really a useful observation. The only thing Bitcoin can do is price out the bad actors.

You make it much too simple. Controlling bitcoin.org does not mean controlling the Bitcoin blockchain. In that case, a few trusted entities could just publish transactions on bitcoin.org, and we wouldn't have to mess about with this trustless peer-to-peer bullshit.
Surely you must see how Bitcoin users value trustlessness, even in this age of speculation?
And I'm very much aware of the split in 2013, which was a bug in the reference client (although some did argue that it was in fact in the database library used). At no time did the protocol change. At no time did the consensus rules change. Those are the hard problems.
If I bought Bitcoin under certain rules, I own them. Ownership of the cryptographic keys are trivial, but those are useless if the blockchain suddenly changes rules and increases the 21M cap or blacklists vendors or blacklists stakeholders. Maintenance of the Bitcoin blockchain must be careful to fulfill that social contract.

I would really like to hear a good argument for anything else. All this talk about "dominance" this and that makes me question what people actually expected?

Destroying Bitcoin is very expensive. What's unique here is that they let their millions of customers pay for taking a stab at it. And what's surprising is that they seem to go along with it.

The paper you refer to doesn't need much convincing. It just describes the status quo.
Your main points can be summarized as "there are big pools in China, and they might be owned by one entity", which is important and a good reason for miners to leave this pool.
It is not an argument for or against PoW. The same centralization would be just as problematic with other mining systems. In fact, many people have argued that it is even more likely to happen with PoS as it makes clear game theoretical sense there, which it doesn't with PoW. We just don't know yet if that is true, since no PoS-based coin has left the proof of concept stage yet.

Most of the token contracts and oracles are better off-chain. Check out Poon's work. That's how Oracles should integrate with a blockchain. Still not convinced Oracles can work securely, but that's a much more promising start.
Exchange contracts are not decentralized. What we shoud have is atomic swaps.
Kittens and other complex contracts are better off-chain. They should anchor whatever merkle roots they can produce to the blockchain, and use it to track ownership like colored coins does. Otherwise any trivial operation ends up on chain and paralyzes the chain completely (case in point).
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:06:06
That makes for a deceptively simple narrative. In fact, what surprised me most about btc1 (or S2X or B2X) was that on it was so opaque. The only public information was the idea of another blocksize doubling after segwit, but not how it was to be deployed or activated, not how it was supposed to be governed, not how it was supposed to be coordinated, and not how it was supposed to have value.
One US and one Chinese exchange with any volume signed off on it, but there was no information about what ticker to use, how to handle cross chain swaps, how to handle custodial wallets, nothing. This made it likely that all of these details were hidden from us and there was some grand plan rolling that outsiders knew nothing about. But reality was much stranger. They hired a developer who seemlingly had the freedom to make up everything as he went on, as long as he delivered something on time, and that something doubled something about the blocks.
I still don't understand what it was, or why the narrative that this was some practical idea that just failed seems to fly with people. Let's not forget the facts surrounding btc1 and the various entities that were connected to it, and then maybe the future can bring us some answers.

No. No, it really didn't. Please stop parroting this line. It was never true, and never part of any official statements from the btc1 project, just from the regular cheerleading squad.
S2x/btc1 had 90% of mining _pool_ support. Not miner support. The _only_ pool that asked their miners didn't see anywhere near those numbers. You would expect the s2x advocates to storm the only pool that lets them vote in order to skew the result, yet they were under 10%.
S2x/btc1 had 90% of which industry's support? Not the exchanges. They only had one of the major ones. Not the developers. The payment processors? Maybe. But that doesn't sound remotely as good, does it?
Even if it all seems long gone by now we should at least try to remember the facts, not the propaganda.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:53:23


So to combat the problem that nobody uses the bigger blocks we're gonna give the users more of the same?
The whole thing with the blocksize increase that once it finally arrived very few people use makes me want to reconsider the whole blocksize debate. Despite all the talk about it, users couldn't care less. That's consistent with users mainly speculating.
If that's good or bad for Bitcoin remains to be seen. It could probably be construed either way.

In order of verified volume at the time: Finex? No. Stamp? No. Kraken? No. GDAX/Coinbase? Yes. Itbit? No. Bitcoin.de? No. Local Bitcoins? No.
That's one of the major exchanges. Two, if you count BTCC as being one of the major exchanges but where volume was questionable. But then you have to count Bittrex, Huobi and Okcoin which are all bigger and did not take part.
That was always the strange part of the agreement. If you do a hard fork where you sell bascially another coin as Bitcoin, but only one of the major exchanges commit to it, how is that going to work out?

Sharding Bitcoin has been a common fantasy among developers since the white paper. It's just that nobody has come up with a way to do it yet, neither on Bitcoin nor Ethereum. It's just that the latter developers are keen on selling stuff that doesn't exist yet (see: "ICO").
But if you can't shard a blockchain, what can you do? Can you partition it into self contained pieces, which could have their own security properties? Congratulations, you just had the idea of sidechains. The mentioned Drivechain is an implementation proposal for this.

Iota is basically whatever balances the Iota company tells you is correct. There's mining, but mostly for show. If you didn't have the Iota company keeping track of everyone's balance it'd be insecure against double spending, which is the hard problem that Bitcoin set out to solve in the first place.
I haven't looked at Raiblocks but from the surface it looks very much like Iota and Ripple, in that it doesn't really try to be trustless system at all. If that's what you are interested in, then it will probably be far superiour to Bitcoin for your needs. But don't confuse it with Bitcoin.
Lightning _is_ Bitcoin, just with delayed settlements. Think of it as a write level cache against the blockchain, with a lot of cryptographic tricks going on to protect against participants flushing stale cache states for their benefit.

How long is reasonable? It has been over a year now.


Actually doing the commit is not a measure of how big change it is. The deployment is the problem. A hard fork probably needs to get deployed some 24 months before it activates, in order to get everyone to switch and have time to test every implementation of Bitcoin. Remember that there's more than one.
And that's only _after_ you get everyone to agree to the change. Which is so far only a theoretical possibility.
Segwit was by far the simpler to deploy. This has now been demonstrated in practice. But that doesn't mean we as users shouldn't stop nagging our service providers to actually use the larger blocks.

Choice of words can be important. "Selling" and "using" Bitcoin are equivalent, and sometimes thought processes can be made clearer by swapping those words.

It's not just segwit. It's the fact that they have lousy fee estimation algorithms, where you have no choice but to pay 100+ sat/b when 20 sat/b transactions get in the next block or two. And they have no incentive to fix it because they just pass on the fees to their customers.
Several of them could also batch their transactions better. These things are trivial to implement compared to segwit, even if it would be nice to get that too.

1% of the world's commerce can not be done on a globally replicated public blockchain.

That's not a compromise. That's just doing two unrelated things. Which shows just how stupid this "argument" really is. Of course we need segwit. How else are we going to add features incrementally to bitcoin, such as new opcodes?

Which is why I can't understand why anyone would advocate for miners to decide block sizes. Surely the most logical and predictable thing to do would be to manipulate them as to maximize transaction fees?
Some miners are even mining empty blocks still, which is block size zero. The only reason they don't do much harm to the network is because they are so few. To let these people decide on block sizes would be to let the fox guard the hen house.

In what way is it okay? The value is, what, a third of what it was (then the DAO was most popular)?
And you can't pay anyone with "Ethereum", because there are now incompatible versions. You would need to be exact about which Ethereum you want to pay with (and pray your payment processor supports it). Eth didn't suffer all that much from that, because to be fair they don't have those services yet. But Bitcoin has.
New users have enough problems as it is choosing a wallet. Imagine if they had to choose a fork too. Some payments are valid in both chains, some just in one. No, that was very far from "okay", and it would be even worse for Bitcoin since there are actual payments taking place every day.
@_date: 2017-02-13 07:58:11
You could argue that given that everyone else is going to do it, you might as well do it too, and pocket the profits while you can. After all, we do see empty blocks now, and there is no reason to believe this would be different with miner controlled block sizes.

Is that really how Bitcoin Unlimited is supposed to work? It sounds rather dangerous, if every node can potentially run their own block size. The chain would be divergent at the last block at any given moment. The potential to trick newbies (and probably also some established payment processors given the problems they have had with malleability which was a known problem) would be infinite.
I imagined from the discussions that they proposed a simple vote for block size, but this is entirely different. How do the developers argue for that change? Has there been any simulations done? Are any of the big Bitcoin companies in on this?
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:57:28
Isn't "Capacity increase" completely incompatible with "allow miners to coordinate block size"? They could just as well decrease block size.
We've seen all sorts of shady behaviour from miners, from selecting transactions from mempool in order to drive up transaction fees to mining empty blocks. Mining with spv is also questionable. The power to decide block size leads to all sorts of manipulation that I can't even think of.
A more likely outcome is "maximizing transaction fees", considering what the economic interest is.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:09:30
They can only control the blocks they themselves mine. Deep into hypotheticals here, but wouldn't the "emergent consensus" (which has only been loosely described in this sub, so I'm not sure I have the whole picture) at some point force the rest of the network to lower their accepted block size to lessen the risk of mining orphans, if a non-trivial part (but still a long shot from 50%) of the hashing power run with a low block size?

If I understand you correctly there is also further risk that the Emergent Consensus miners could potentially fork again during this period, which might cause the "regular" original chain to suddely have more power than any of the younger split chains.
It is easy to loose one's head trying to come up with possible scenarios in an Emergent Consensus model. I think it would require a more rigorous mathematical analysis to understand the properties of the model. It's a shame nobody seems to be interested.
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:43:14
Because it's far from clear that it lowers fees. It gives miners control over blocksize, therefore indirectly over fees.
That's probably the only thing that's clear about emergent consensus. It's also worth to think about the consequences of that.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:06:14


Can we not get rid of "BU get us bigger blocks" soon? There are plenty of reasons to be suspicious about those claims.
BU takes max blocksize out of the hands of the developers. This is where big blockes should be suspicious. It would make zero sense for miners to raise blocksize only to get increased validation latency and risk lower fees in total.
Everyone seems to realize this and therefore the argument is that miners would do this to see total economic activity increase as Bitcoin would get more useful, thereby increasing value and not miner fees. This makes even less sense. If miners wanted to increase the usability of Bitcoin, surely they would not go back to a year old version and thereby miss out on a lot of useful features (not only segwit).
Miners are not interested in bigger blocks. If they were, the reception towards those proposals would have been very different. Gavin and Mike had, shall we say, limited success with that. But a few of them would be potentially very interested in having a say over the consensus rules regarding newly minted blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:30:56
I think it kind of makes sense from an economical perspective. Mining has been an arms race, and will continue to be for the forseeable future (which admittedly isn't very far). Due to the rapid difficulty increases you continously have to invest in new process equipment. Any investment must be done on a time scale of a few months. The mining landscale is different now from two years ago, and in two years time it could potentially be completely different again.
That brings a natural limit to the time frame a miners operates in. If segwit brings about an enormous increase in transaction usage in two years time, that is all but useless for someone who invests in mining today.
I personally think LN is a bit oversold, it will be a very long time until it is potentially useful in practice, and until then on-chain transactions will continue to dominate. But maybe that's where Bitmain is coming from.

Why this pretension that "core" is some kind of organization? It is a client implementing the "Bitcoin" protocol. (With which you can pay someone in "bitcoin".) And why the deliberate confusion of "core" (a piece of software), "Bitcoin" (a protocol and blockchain) and "segwit" (a feature of said protocol).
**Bitcoin** (the community) did deliver on **segwit**. Core developers implemented it (in **core**). btcd developers implemented it (in **btcd**). libbitcoin developers haven't implemented it (in **libbitcoin**).
I think all this seemingly intentional confusion between protocol and implementation, and between project and product, must have some hidden agenda but I'm struggling to see what it is. Can we please speak of EC and segwit in terms of proposed features of the Bitcoin protocol, and of core and btcd as implementations of said protocol? "Core devs" can not promise anything related to Bitcoin the protocol, they can only suggest, implement and await the community's reaction.

But the potential gain is also huge, is it not? If you could, by colluding with other miners and/or play your EB cards right, in one stroke invalidate _all_ your compeition's work for the past day? Even one hour would be worth killing for. Not only would your competition lose money but the lost hash rate would be unaccounted for in the next difficulty increase.
By the way, here's another question: Coinbase transactions requries 100 confirmations if I recall correctly? Because orphans etc. But in EC model, chains that deep could very well be orphaned. They could easily have been spent by then. How is that handled?
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:23:57
You could have picked a better example. Can you imagine the dev meeting: "we have to remove segwit, theymos is against it..", "oh, crap, that looked like a useful feature".
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:49:01


The longest _valid_ chain.
Otherwise miners would instantly set back inflation to the original value and give themselves 50 BTC per block. It wouldn't be hard to get a majority of miners behind _that_ change.
But those blocks would be considered invalid and rightfully rejected by the rest of the network. I wouldn't be surprised however if we find ourselves with a proposed fork very much like this in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:40:42
The emergent consensus model, as described, is a game theoretic problem where the rational cause of action is to game the EB signalling rather than use it to signal your honest intentions. That you earn more money by being honest is a property of the Bitcoin PoW model, not the emergent consensus model. I believe this could be proven experimentally if even a rudimentary testnet was available.
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:49:01


The way BU works is that if Ver, Wu and/or Peter R decide something, it happens. So expect one of the early post-fork blocks on the BTC chain to be invalid by the BTU software.
It's quite a tight team behind BU, and they can play fast and loose with the software. That mitigates the risk of long protruded discussions about new features and makes for decisive development so they have no problem chaging the rules as they go. Very much like Ethereum in fact, which hard forked no less than 6 times, one of which was that the developers were about to lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:36:29


Not really, unless this is some theoretical question of culture relativity.
Ask _anyone_ who works with the established Bitcoin companies or in the fintech sphere. Ask them how long time it would take them, at an absolute minimum, to replace the consensus rules of Bitcoin in an incompatible way and/or rip out the underlying software on their systems and recertify everything. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it is a herculean task. There are many competing Bitcoin software and you have to modify every one of them, or replace them entirely.
They have to have a credible plan how to do this well in advance. And not a single one of them have. Because no one have taken the possibility seriously yet. Not until this became a media event and customers became worried did the exchanges even put out an official statement. Payment processors, regulated custodial services etc. still haven't, really. You'd notice if they did because they actually have legal responsibilities to.
The days when you slapped something together in php and called yourself a Bitcoin business is long gone, at least in Western Europe and North America. It may be more boring now in a way, but it is also a place where developers can find real jobs doing this.


Oh, but there absolutely is, for businesses. Try registering a Bitcoin business where you handle other people's money without a real defintion of "Bitcoin".
There is a Bitcoin certificate trading at Stockholmsbörsen since two years ago. Look at how much money is invested in that. What do you think Finansinspektionen would say if they swapped out those certificates with BU blockchain certificates, because there is "no official definiton"? That would be outright illegal. And that's just one of the tradeable entitites of Bitcoin around the world. Look at the public paperwork surroudning the Winklevoss ETF in the US, they did some serious homework on this. Read it and tell me they could trade on the BU blockchain without restarting the process with the SEC.


This is not in dispute, I hope. This is how you choose between several valid chains. But competing invalid chains no not enter the question. It would not matter if the software under which the chain is valid calls itself Bitcoin or something else entirely.


I don't know what venues you frequent in the Bitcoin space nowadays, but it seems to me this is something of the most discussed topics during the past four years. There has been upwards a dozen proposals on how to properly manage blocksize forks from the Bitcoin core developers alone. Then there has been a tremendous amount of work on features related to scaling such as segregated witness and Schnorr signatures.
It's hard to keep up with everything that is happening in this space, especially if you are technically inclined to actually understand how these things work. And that's what keeps me interested in Bitcoin.
But the scaling problem does not operate in a vacuum. Bitcoin has obvious problems scaling, but it also has performance problems. Denial of service attacks are much too easy. The fee market is also something that wasn't really designed, it's much too easy to game, and it's not clear how it will develop when inflation secedes. Development in this space has to take all of these things into consideration.
There are many competing crypocurrencies which try to improve on Bitcoin in some notable way. There is always the possibility that one of these survives where Bitcoin doesn't. We are all still early adopters and this is all still experimental in that sense. But there is no possbility that an entirely different team will produce some different software and everyone would suddenly agree that this is now the new Bitcoin. Not at this stage.


Ethereum has no payment processors. They have no publicly traded certificates. They have no regulated custodial wallets. They have a few exchanges. They are where Bitcoin were five years ago. Which is not a bad place to be, but it would look very different in five years. It has taken much longer than that to mature the financial market around Bitcoin, and still it feeling like it's barely getting started.
They also went through the fork with a 75% reduction in value. That is not unprecendented in Bitcoin, but it could potentially be a bit more damaging to Bitcoin. And that was just a backwards incompatibility. They did specifically _not_ rip out the entire development team and change to a completely different legal entity and governance model.

No. No, it's really not. EC is something else entirely. A constantly forking blockchain is completely opposite to a controlled blocksize increase.
EC doesn't even guarantee a larger blocksize. We could very well end up with a smaller one, if the hashrate majority decided that would make them more money.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:30:09


Good point. I wanted to point out  that the previous proposals (including XT and Classic) would be impossible to realize under BU rules. Of course, those changes could only be proposed by bitcoin developers, not realized without the support of the economic majority, and that is an important distinction.


For you maybe. If you own a big part of the hashing power you might see a very big value in the possibility to affect block validation rules in other ways in the future. I've said it before, but I think the biggest challenge Bitcoin will face over the next five years is controlling inflation. As miners become more important economic players, they will fight tooth and nail for every ounce of influence they can get.

If I wanted to check signatures for all downloaded blocks like before, how would I go about that?
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:30:39


Which is why a BU fork was never a credible threat.
Even if a hard fork was made with a majority of the hash power, since the forked coins would not be immediately usable to pay your bills with and would not trade at the biggest exchanges, those miners would switch back to the old chain long before any difficulty changes were to be made.
I don't think anyone who hasn't worked on financial systems realizes how big operations like Bitpay or any of the other big Bitcoin companies really are. They may not even run Bitcoin Core, some run competing Bitcoin software such as btcd. None of the existing Bitcoin implementations are compatible with BU. Of those who do run core, many have local modifications that does not carry over to BU.
You simply can't switch out the Bitcoin software in any of these companies. If you absolutely had to, it would still take enormous work to re-develop their services on another coin. Then we haven't even begun thinking about the regulations around change management in the financial sector. Those companies that are regulated would then have to start that process. And those companies that holds customer funds would have to explain to the regulator why they would switch customer coins from one chain to another and show that they can take "reasonable steps" to mitigate any loss.
The process would take _years_. You can not start a legitimate regulated Bitcoin company in the space of a few months, and you can not change the underlying blockchain on existing ones. It simply cannot be done.

If that was true, they would 1) not have blocked every other large block proposal, 2) not block segwit, 3) not support BU where miners are allowed to decrease as well as increase blocksize, 4) not fill blocks with transactions intended to drive up fees. That type of manipulation will only become more expensive.
The only reason blocksize even enters the discussion is because that is an established conflict the Bitcoin community. By supporting one side they gain leverage over consensus parameters. This is indeed valuable in a number of ways. Changes regarding the next halving would not fly when many developers needs to be convinced about changes and regard them under strict scrutiny.

And in what way would it keep the community together? BU doesn't want bigger blocks. If they wanted that, they would have run with Classic. Or XT. Or any of the other big block hard fork proposals. BU gives a system of block chain forks which invalidates or survives in some more or less coordinated fashion. Nobody can say for certain that blocksize would even increase under that system.
The BU people would absolutely not be interested in a 2MB HF. Maybe Gavin would, but the pool operators wouldn't. Where would that take us?

It's not trivial to make breaking changes to the consensus rules ("hard fork"). It needs to be scheduled well in advance, thoroughly tested etc. That's not something to be done in a heart beat. One could probably argue that preparations could have been already under way, but that's been difficult to reach consensus about in the developer community.
There are also other work that needs to be done to Bitcoin. It used to be much simpler to slow verifications to a crawl, something that would have been a problem with bigger blocks, but thankfully that's better now. So any bigger block work probably needs the performance improvement and newer functionality of recent Bitcoin releases anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:35:02
Since the incentive you speak about is money, it should be obvious that money does not follow miners. Miners follow money. The coin that has the most economic activity, and for now that is Bitcoin, attracts the most hashing power.

@_date: 2017-03-26 20:42:05


Where does this idea come from? Miners resisted Classic and they resisted XT, which both had a blocksize increase. Now some miners embrace BU which doesn't, but instead lets miners influence blocksize parameters in a complex game of signalling... and suddely people believe something like XT now could take off?
No, it couldn't. The point of BU isn't to revert the last 4000 commits to Bitcoin. What's important is to "strip Blockstream of power". You can just look at their forum or their supporters Twitter accounts to see page after page of how important it is to relieve the "Core developers" of power. So instead of the peer review and consensus driven governance, they want a small committee of a handful of hand-picked people. To get "developer access" you have to apply for it. If you want to write an improvement proposal, you send it to the President. But please don't listen to me or anyone else. Just read the abundance of governance documents they have published on their web pages. That explains in detail how this will work.
So, no. Some people want to see a compromise between Bitcoin and BU. But you can't compromise on turning the project over to new developers. You either do it or you don't. Some people think BU would go away if Bitcoin just hard forked a larger blocksize. (Of which there has been several proposals exactly how to do that. By "core developers".) But that's not true either.
I personally don't know if Blockstream or any other company has an undue influence over the developer community. I know other projects with similar problems, so it's clearly possible. But the response to that must be to diversify development over more companies. Involve more interested parties in development. Not by revoking repository access to developers just because they are affiliated with the wrong company.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:19:16

It means that you validate segwit transactions.
If you _want_ the functionality offered by segwit transactions, you use them.
Sure, if you absolutely want some part of the Bitcoin protocol inactivated you could patch your client to not care. Segwit is safe that way. You would potentially relay bad transactions, but as long as the majority verifies them the network is safe.
You could also choose to, for example, not support checklockverify. But why would you do that? If everybody cherry-picked their favorite opcodes to support, Bitcoin the protocol would not function. That's why it's called consensus rules.

@_date: 2017-03-29 11:41:06
Is that really likely? I hear it a lot, but it doesn't square with what I've seen over the years.
A few years ago (has it really been that long already?) the reward was so great that miners didn't care. That's when we saw the pool businesses keeping fees because miners didn't care. Fees were a fraction of a percent of the mining reward. But now that we've had not one but two halvenings, that subsidization is gone. Fees aren't where it's at yet, we still see the aforementioned business models, but everyone realizes where we're going. And miners will need fees where we're going.
So either the mining business model needs to change, and mining a _lot_ less lucrative (even considering increasing value), or there will need to be a lot more fees. It has always been my null hypothesis that blocks are full because mining rewards are emptying, and I have yet to see evidence of the contrary.
We've seen a lot of fee strategies play out in the mined blocks and I think this will continue. If the blockchain suddenly grew bigger blocks for some reason, we'd still see full blocks. It's like the concept in traffic planning where the highway is always equally full, no matter if you expand or contract capacity. Or to put it another way: The demand on eternal world wide distributed storage is, perhaps unsurprisingly, very elastic with price.
This a reason to take fees as a reason for block size increases with a grain of salt. We might need them anyway (which is likely and an important reason to discuss strategies), but as a way to control fees it is less than ideal. At least as long as we're in the same order of magnitude as today. Any bigger than that, say a hundred-fold increase for example, is a fundamentally different discussion.

I refuse to think it is a conincidence that miners started grumbling about changing consensus rules right after the last halving. Of course, no one speaks about changing the block subsidy. Yet. But we have only three years to the next one, and you have to start somewhere.
Block size is perfect to start with as it plays right into an ongoing debate among the devs. It also affects the acceptance of newly mined blocks, just as messing with the coinbase would. I would bet money that we'll see the first proposals to change inflation rate before the next halving, and also that the first ones won't be taken seriously.

Please note that this doesn't have to be transactions from the mempool (if anyone missed that part). They can fill the block with anything they'd like. It can be generated on the fly, so why limit it to 1GB?
Perhaps one can pre-calculate the hash of a partial block that is much larger that that? The described attack could then be used to effectively kill other nodes, including competing miners, who would dutifully try to store it to disk. After all, there is no size limit so why not take advantage of that?
This would be a denial of service to the network, by complexity or simply by size, that could potentially be very rewarding. Because the attacker could skip validating or storing that block and continue mining while the rest of the network grinds to a halt.
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:25:01

@_date: 2017-03-20 12:21:42
It's not. It has nothing to do with BU. Segwit is a new _feature_ for the bitcoin protocol. It's a bit more known than most because many people are eager to build stuff on top of segwit when it is finally usable. Support has been in the standard bitcoin software ("core") for some time, and it has been developed under the normal peer-reviewed process.
BU is a different _software_ which is designed to be compatible with the normal bitcon protocol until a certain point, provided enough mining power runs this software instead. Its main difference from plain vanilla bitcoin is that it has a scheme designed to fork the blockchain now and again, and invalidate whichever chain the majority hashrate doesn't follow. The point is to allow colluding miners to change rules of the protocol. From the start the only rule change the software allows is to set max blocksize, both up and down.
What rule changes that may be allowed in the future we know little about. And this is perhaps the main difference. BU is developed by a small team that does not work with traditional open source peer review, on mailing lists and IRC, in the same way. This usually leads to faster decision making but there is the risk of stagnation in the future if they don't get a more diverse group of developers involved.

Is it really increase only? I was under the impression it was to be totally dynamic, i.e. block size could just as well be decreased.
Was the protocol changes in BU published and publicly discussed somewhere? There are many confusing tidbits of information about how it's supposed to work.
(On a related note: is there a maximum max block size in BU? If there isn't, why not remove the limit entirely? That would be functionally the same but with no changes to the protocol.)
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:00:13


I see, but I don't really understand the difference. The network _does_ switch to a 'less worked on' BTU chain in this case, which just incidentally happens to be the 'BTC chain'.
Which I also find weird. I see a lot of discussions around the fact that BU could potentially drop a hard fork and go back to the old chain. But that is the whole point with the Emergent Consensus model. It is _supposed_ to forget the chains that are weak and do not survive. Is it somehow more notable because another client follows the stronger chain? I don't see it.


"Working" could potentially mean different things depending on context.
* In a technical sense, Emergent Consensus is working as long as the blocksize keeps changing and subchains gets orphaned.
* Emergent Consensus is working in a trivial sense in that it is processing transactions and not crashing if miners never change blocksize (which should surprise no one, miners have rightfully been skeptical of blocksize increases before since it does make transaction fees lower).
* Emergent Consensus is working in a social sense if miners are colluding and only make consensus changes to the blocksize. This behaviour is what Gavin thinks will happen, if I understand his replies on Twitter correctly.
But the latter model is one I never really understood. If miner collude to make their changes in complete consensus, why would you need the Emergent Consensus then? In that case you could just change the blocksize in a completely normal pre-planned hard fork. The Emergent Consensus system just begs to be gamed.
Gavins answer is that miners would never do anything that wasn't in the long term economic interest of the system. I'm not so sure about that, and I very much would not like to gamble billions (not even other people's money) to find out.
It is very hard to find out how Emergent Consensus is really supposed to work, and what the intended outcome is. I did ask a few of the basic questions one gets but most developer activity seems to be on Reddit and you get downvoted to invisibility for asking them. It would be preferrable if development was done in the open so anyone interested could at least have the possibility to understand and have an informed opinion.

Again, absolute numbers matter. A chain is protected by economic incentives, as any miner makes more money by mining than by attacking.
Attacking a chain has a pricetag. This pricetag is in petahash, not in percent of Bitcoin. Attacking the 20% has a pricetag one-fourth of attacking the 80% one. The available hashrate is not a global fixed amount that can be redistributed, it is something you buy. It is not cheaper for miners to use existing hashpower than it is to buy new.

They could have fixed the problem in the 3.2 branch. That would have gotten much more people to upgrade, instead of users trying to work around their denial of service just in order to stay on an old version. That's not a good way to keep users safe.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:38:17


What are those incentives? I would expect the raised transaction fees to be an incentive against (too) big blocks, and that there is an equilibrium to it. It is not obvious that is above a megabyte. Has anyone run the numbers on this? What does it look like?


Any miner, yes. How does BU protect against that, apart from the fact that you need to do it 16 blocks in succession before everyone has to accept it?
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:12:37
Absolutely, I just want to emphasise the difference between absolute and relative hashrate in the light of a possible fork.
A 20% fork of the blockchain would be a lot less secure than the 80% one, but it would not be insecure in any reasonable sense of the word. It would still be protected by more hashrate than the whole of Bitcoin was four years ago. It would still make millions of dollars worth of hashrate (not of equipment, mind you, but of lost income) to attack.
The blockchain was designed to so would make more money mining it than attacking it. This was true four years ago and is still true today.
If one fifth of current blockchain hashrate is not secure, then there are a lot of altcoins that must be considered insecure as well. Including doge. And I don't think that could be reasonably argued unless you have a very specific threat model. Bitcoin was never secure against an attacker with unlimited funds. Much has been written over the years on what NSA or other big state actors could do. That may make for interesting calculations, but it has very little to do with any practical attacks.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:02:12


But you would need (close to) 50% of the hash power to run a divergent block size for it to matter, and then you need to convince exchanges and nodes to run your code for it to have economic value. What does that threshold look like with this hypothetical signalling in place? How do you find out? Do you envision the non-mining nodes to just accept any block size the miners signal for?
@_date: 2017-03-11 22:49:26
It's not that there doesn't _exist_ regulated exchanges, it's that have have no volume to speak of. You have to give them that. The report specifically mention some well regulated exchanges by name, but all the volume are in a few Chinese (which only very recently became slightly less questionable) and bitfinex (which is pretty open about their insider trading). I think anyone who has tried their luck trading Bitcoin have a few stories to tell.
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:42:51


You don't know that. Another reason is to slightly lower the probability of an orphan block. (Tragedy of the commons and all that. ) We've seen miners do a lot of unexpected things. The system must count on miners maximizing their profit short term, not working for the good of the system long time, otherwise it is not sustainable.


Is this a hypothetical scenario? What would be the signal to send if you wanted to maximize profit? The goal would be to maximize every other actor's risk of orphaning a block while minimizing your own.
Remember the paper on selfish mining? How would that scenario work out in a context where you can delay signalling block size until your fellow miners are ahead?

Bitcoin has been fixed more than once. However there is a big difference between a bug fix which causes a temporary hard fork, and changes to consensus rules to reverse certain transactions. And the point here is that miners don't have the power to do neither of these things. Miners don't dictate consensus rules, they follow them.

Even if one company would have too much influence over the project, the answer must never be dictatorship (benevolent or otherwise), nor must it be throwing away any contribution "tainted" by said company. That is the one sure way to kill the project.
The answer must be to get _another_ company to invest in salaried contributors. Surely out of the dozens of companies in the Bitcoin space with dozens of million in resources there must be a few more?
@_date: 2016-06-18 12:35:34
What's with this collective fantasy that miners decide on forks?
Say that the big five Bitcoin miners collectively decide against the halving. They release a fork of Bitcoin and mine a chain where they still get 25 BTC per block. And why wouldn't they? After all, it is in their financial interest!
Do you know what would happen? Every user would see it as a hash rate drop. I would run down the basement and start mining again. Then the miners would drop their fork and all would be back to normal. Miners don't decide on forks. They need to mine whatever chain users and exchanges are on, otherwise their investment is for nothing.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:18:59
That's what I'm saying. That would be a reason to mine a small or empty block.

Not really. Dino makes the statement that the hackers are despositing eth to exchanges to convert to btc. That's an outright lie.
The main problem here is that the core eth developers are heavily invested in the dao, both economically and emotionally. That's why they're even considering a hard fork to blacklist transactions. Some of the smaller altcoins have done exactly this, so there is precedence and it's not confidence inspiring. (The 2013 bitcoin bug fix is a red herring, they never blacklisted anything.)
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:05:35


This statement is trivially false. Litecoin is not "insecure", in any reasonable sense of the word, just because it has a fraction of the hashrate behind Bitcoin.
A coin has value if people trade it. A blockchain is secure if enough hashpower secure it. In absolute value, not in fractions of Bitcoin hashrate.

I don't doubt the majority of mining power, but there are very few of the big companies on the list. Coinbase and Bitpay is on there but most are small companies you've never heard about. You claimed strong economic support then linked to a list there most businesses were listed as "undecided".
Now you linked the original announcement which is a bit underwhelming on the business side. Notably there are no exchanges beside Coinbase. There are a lot of claims thrown around of "majority" and "overwhelming" this or that but absolutely no explanation was this means.
Downvote all you want from your alphanumerical username but this fork remains controversial. I could name half a dozen big players off hand that I would expect to find on the list of supporters if the consensus claim was even remotely true.

Falkvinge was known for going all in on Bitcoin but he was equally famous for exiting his position the year after that, when we had the fall from $30. The fear of missing out must have caught up with him, as later publicly declared Bitcoin "greatly overvalued" at $140. Wanted back in, eh?

What are you talking about? There are no sides. Every improvement to Bitcoin must stand on its own.
One proposal does not get better if another is worse. We don't pick and choose one versus another. We as a community value each proposal on its own merits alone.
Hard forks have a high bar. They need almost unanimous consensus to be workable. They have to be iterated until all serious objections addressed and every corner case mapped out and thought through.
Segwit2x in particular was almost void of information, it was just a vague idea and a list of fifty or so businesses (most of which you've never heard of) committing to something they themselves couldn't even explain. A handful of developers did a good job of making something understandable out of it and got rid of the worst aspects. And they could probably coax it through if they are willing to invest time and energy to it, there are many aspects yet to be addressed, but right now it looks like nobody's willing to pay and the lead developer wants to throw it over the wall as soon as possible.
Empty talk about some secret majority that backs it and dismissing all work that remains to be done is hard to take seriously. In the list you linked very few companies were colored green for supportive of the proposal.

So, basically no increase in support during the past three months? Not even a small uptake?
Is because miners don't actually run the bitcoind software ("core"?)? What needs to happen for adoption among miners? SegWit would make the software more useful, therefore more valuable, so it should be a no-brainer for them.

It is. BCH replay protection was changed last minute. It used to be some other method, then there was segwit sighash, and then it was made mandatory. I've found the only reliable source of documentation on BCH to be the ABC source code (avoid Electron).

Payments are currently limited to 0.042 BTC and channels 4x that, according to the developers. It is likely to change in the future. But the use case is for making many small payments so it's not unreasonable to have a safety limit in place.

That doesn't make sense. If you believe Bitcoin-core and every other compatible implemention will end up on a minority chain, this doesn't help. At all.
The only implication this change will have, as long as the transactions are compatible between Bitcoin and btc1 and flows freely between them, is to not require manual intervention from the node operator when a fork happens. I disagree that peer changes should be done manually as part of operating a Bitcoin node.
That said, I personally disagree with this change. There should instead be slot reservations for the various flags. But there are many other things that should have been done differently, including the use of the hard fork flag in hard forks. However in case that can not be deployed in time, this is clearly the less bad solution.
The opinion presented that consensus rules should be optional and set by the operator of each node is a new one to me, and doesn't really seem fully thought through. The fact that Bitcoin Cash uses Bitcoin-like addresses has already made a number of users lose their money, not fully understanding neither the technical realities of the situation nor the services they use and the implications thereof, and regularly send transactions intended for one chain on the other.
Imagine what would happen if every operator could create a chain by tweaking a knob. How many blockchains would we have then? You would need to know the full parameters of the consensus ruleset to make a transaction, not only the public address. It would be a support and usability nightmare, not to mention quite useless as a payment system.

"Overwhelming" yet only one of the big exchanges promised support? That's ... not really convincing.


What is a promise worth when you don't lose anything from breaking it? Not much, I suppose, since one of the biggest pools already found time to jumpstart their own altcoin in the mean time. All the while parroting "our support for s2x is unwavering" of course, so yeah, that's how expensive words are.
My guess is that miners are rational and will mine whatever is most proftitable. So you want buying pressure. A lot of it. Which brings us around to those exchanges again...

I want to like Kraken. I really do. I generally recommend it to users because they at least made an effort to answer to regulatory concerns which should make it more trustworthy than those who don't. The support actually replies which is better than almost everyone else.
But for trading it sucks. It's really, really bad. The user interface is slow. Sometimes it just doesn't respond. Did it accept my order? Who knows. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't. This is real money for me and that's just not acceptable.
Every time there is a rapid market move, which is when you really need the site working, it turns completely unresponsive. It can execute orders in the wrong order or not at all. People say the API works better, but I haven't bothered.
My recommendation would be to use it for one time buys, for which it is great, but not anything else.

The community agreed because Vitalik made it clear where he stands, and they all know the coin is useless without Vitalik. You would have expected some opposition otherwise, seeing most people _didn't_ put their coins in an obvious scam contract.
Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik control so much of the available ether that they can influence the price. This was a pre-mined coin after all. Rational actors run their software as this is in their best economic interest. This may not be a problem for you, in which case you probably made a lot of money this year, but it is absolutely a centralized governance structure in every possible way.
There's also the coming PoS fork where those who control the ether, the Foundation and a handful exchanges, will be those minting new ones. That puts them in control over float. Which again might be good for value, people who speculated in XRP got what they came for, but make no mistake as to its centralization.

He in it to get fiat-rich, but as long as he's mainly in ether your interests align and as a speculator you should keep trusting him. That's what I'm saying. Going against him in a game where he is, if not in direct control then at least influential, of the rules is not wise.
Much has been said about the Ethereum Foundation's holdings and I will not dwell on it further. Suffice to say the released figures is not the whole story as they do not count ether tied up in contracts and they count ether they sold to themselves, as individuals, as sold. The real figure is much higher, although far from as high as the 10% you mention. However it would be equally unwise to go against Satoshi should he still be with us.
Consider how much ether's value fluctuated earlier this year on a stupid 4chan hoax regarding Vitalik. It was important enough for him to counter the stupidness publicly instead of ignoring it. That should tell you how much of ether's value is directly tied to him.

It's not comparable to a giftcard in the sense that a giftcard is issued by a merchant. If that merchant bankrupts the giftcard is without value. Its value is based on trust which is opposite of Bitcoin's design. Most giftcards have little or no use as a general currency because of this.

That's just being a peer-to-peer system, which is what Bitcoin also is. The difference is that Bitcoin has no routing to speak of, it can gossip in an everyone-tell-everyone fashion. In Lightning your transaction has a specific destination in mind and should preferrably go there as smart as possible. Other nodes are not interested in your transaction since it (hopefully) isn't going into the blockchain.
Amazon, should they accept Bitcoin, could implement regular on-chain payments in the exact same fashion you describe. They could only accept connections from a few trusted nodes. No payment provider has put up these kind of restrictions for Bitcoin payments yet as they are usually interested in getting your money.
It's not usually a winning strategy to make it more complicated for people to pay you but it isn't an unthinkable situation. There's certainly the possibility that big businesses will start accepting Bitcoin payments but only if you pay with a special Bitcoin software that implements KYC/AML processes. If you hear about parts of the Bitcoin community centralizing their development around companies involved with blockchain analysis products, it might be good to keep that risk factor in mind.

That would be a useless definition. In practice the situation you describe would not be as clear cut, but rather oscillating to find an equilibrium. You can't reasonably use a definition where what is Bitcoin constantly changes back and forth.

We can (mostly) agree about that. (Apart from the miners incentives. They don't want lower fees. This whole mess started with miners sceptical about larger blocks.)  It is however completely unrelated to the points I made. S2x claims of overwhelming support are not convincing. Then Bitcoin Cash happened.

Didn't Ver used to run some site where you could trade your Twitter account for Bitcoin or buy followers for the same? I might be confusing him with someone else but there absolutely was such a thing.
There are lots of sites where you can buy Reddit account, they all compete for SEO so there are lost of hits should you google it. It's a buyer's market however. An old account loaded up with over a thousand karma goes for about $5. They're all created with script who upvote each other so humans shouldn't really try to compete.
I may be awfully non-sentimental about my Reddit prescence but I still wouldn't want to sell it for $5.

Your first Bitcoin post on Reddit was in 2013 which is well into the modern era of Bitcoin. The thing is, so much half truths are spread about the early days of Bitcoin that it's impossible to take everything seriously. There are a lot of talk about what the early development work was for and what Satoshi really envisioned from people who have absolutely no clue and haven't even read the mailing list and forums from that time.


Bank shills don't troll Reddit. If you are at a bank, concerned with how Bitcoin might affect your business, you hedge by buying Bitcoin. Not by trolling Reddit. The Buttcoiners were bored people who found respect from others by making fun of something online. Many grew increasingly bitter as Bitcoin increased in value and some can be found in other forums today where they invested in some altcoin or offshoot of bitcoin.


In theory, and that could be a valid question going forward, but not worth taking seriously just yet. We're still in the formative years of Bitcoin. People still build infrastructure. All the technology developed today, such as payment channels, sidechains, smart contracts, bonds, all of those compete for developer mindshare. There are competing ideas how to realize them, what the attack vectors are, and how secure they are against them. But common to all of these things is that they are developed on Bitcoin. The Bitcoin open source project, that is, where you go to a mailing list and participate. All that massive work every day is not going to suddenly migrate to some other project, especially not one that is less transparent and open than Bitcoin is, unless some major disaster strikes.

Yeah, I was hoping someone else would jump in here and supply the facts, but as I remember there have been several problems of the "this would never have worked" kind, of which the Berkeley DB misusage was the one that blew up in everyone's face. I would like to think that was after the 1MB limit was put in place, because that limit is really old, with the point being that long before any limit was put in place the code didn't really allow for large blocks. So it's not like any lack of limit was due to some great vision, only that no one bothered from the beginning, and the limit was put in place long before we could realistically reach it.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:36:06
Only because you used another meaning of the word. End user might _care_ about the transacted value, but that doesn't make it any more relevant for calculating fees.
You don't pay for transaction value. You pay per transaction. (And that such a system will be useful only above a certain limit compared to some other system where you pay a percentage should come as a surprise to nobody.)
Mentioning the value makes it look like Mycelium calculated 8 from 1400 which it didn't. (It still sucks of course.)

Transactions are compatible between bitcoin and s2x. If transactions are replayed across chains normal users might not be able to do it at all.
If you are part of the more important people who can influence miners what to include, like most of the signatories of the agreement are, you can probably do it that way. Perhaps services can spring up that can do it for a fee. I'm not thrilled about it as it's not really a fair system.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:21:27
It _does_ mean that they won't support s2x _exclusively_. Which is what many people has been saying a long time.
Some people have long arguments all based on the mythical 80%+ of hash power that s2x will have. This is not a realistic supposition as that would not be a rational economic decision for the miners, as demonstrated today and multiple times before.

Another important thing to realize is that fees were at it's highest in 2013, it's been a bit lower since then. It's just that the dollar has fallen so sharply against the Bitcoin so that those fees are now worth a lot more.
Some people like to report fees in USD, but that's not very honest. All coins have their transaction fees in their native currency, and no coin has any system in place to compensate for the exchange rate against the US dollar.
I'm not saying expensive transactions aren't a problem, just that the only difference between now and three years ago is that your Bitcoin appreciated in value. Which is a problem, but a comparably nice problem to have.

Core is a piece of software. It does what it is programmed to do. People who want to improve the protocol should write BIPs and seek community consensus, not paying people to re-tweet soundbites.


"Stop running the Bitcoin software and run our software instead, which has one developer who is on our payroll. It's better because blocksize, something or other. Also, everyone who disagrees is evil."
It's not that it's badly planned. It wasn't planned at all, because planning isn't what's important here. All that matters is that you stop using Bitcoin and use their software instead. They will tell you what you want to hear, as long as they can get you to run their software.

This is something I never understood why it isn't more popular. Coinbase and Bitpay could settle things off-chain, it'd be absolutely instant, zero-fee payments for Coinbase customers. That could be the selling point of Coinbase's wallet which is otherwise not very useful.
Then rinse and repeat. The five biggest exchanges and the five biggest payment processors could probably cover pretty much all of Bitcion retail payments. Sure, it'd be centralized and completely trusting a third party but for payments it would win over any other coin any way you look at it. This could have happened years ago and requires no special tech. I think Greenaddress wanted to build this, but it never really caught on. One can only speculate as to why not.
The use case for Lightning is pretty much the same, only any exchange can participate without asking for permission and it's completely trustless. I don't think that's a bad thing.

That's how each and every open source projects work. How many programmers "control" the Linux repo? One. The maintainer. The maintainer does not (primarily) write code, but merge the patches that have consensus, listen to the those that do QA and form consensus around what is deemed tested, and roll releases. That is janitorial work, that at the same time requires a high level of domain specific knowledge. It does not mean they have any control of what goes in and doesn't, not anymore than any other programmer. If they didn't do a good job someone else would take over.


Bitcoin is a protocol, yes. If there is only one roadmap that's only because you haven't written one yet. Bitcoin is a multi stakeholder project, and no single entity decides what everyone should work on. Since no one decides, that means any roadmap carry limited value. There are no project managers that can promise features delivered to customers.  Again, it's how open source projects work.


Right, because software that pretends to be Bitcoin but have subtle but designed-in divergences from the standard Bitcoin will lead to third parties losing money. Bitcoin only has value because people trust it, and if funds are lost because of incompatible implementations end users would not be able to trust it anymore.
That doesn't mean it is impossible to discuss incompatible proposals, such as segwit2x. But those making the proposals must be ready and able to meet any objections or counter proposals made from others in order to reach a proposal all stakeholders can be happy with. In fact that very proposal was originally made on the Bitcoin development mailing list if I recall correctly.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:01:06
The advice is serious. When you play the altcoin game ("diversify" but within crypto) you have to get in early. The ones who earn the most are those who start their own coin.
And if you see value in a coin with segwit removed you should see more value in a coin with P2SH removed. Everything you say about segwit is true for P2SH too.

Interesting that Roger considers Bitcoin to be "hijacked" and does not agree with the actions taken by the bitcoin developers.
When further asked about what these actions are, it is actually some _inactions_ he disagrees with, particularly the inactions of _not_ implementing some changes he really, really wants to have implemented.
There is probably a lot to say about this. I just don't know where to start.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:27:45


_Nobody_ understands that. Given any sort of domain knowledge, it just doesn't make sense. I think _that's_ the point.
You can't really argue against what you don't understand a word of. And enough people are watching Bitcoin from the sidelines that vaguely technical sounding sentences can still influence public perception.


Nah, the clever thing about segwit is that we finally got unmalleable transactions. That wasn't a year too soon, should have happened long ago. The bigger blocks are just gravy.
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:32:43


This is crazy talk to anyone who has followed the development list for the past years. There are very little outright rejections at all, but a lot of disagreements on the how's, why's and when's. And a lot of what I consider to be informed technical discussion.
It is also ignorant of the fact that we almost doubled the allowed block size (well, sort of) not much more than two months ago. If developers rejected on chain scaling, why do you think that doubling was even added to the proposal?
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:40:48
Also the fact is that Gavin left the project and handed over maintainership to Wladimir.
Why should Gavin have maintainer privileges if he wasn't a maintainer anymore? If by any chance he would come back to the project he'd probably come back as a developer, not a maintainer. (Developers generally doesn't have commit rights, maintainers do.)
Bitcoin as a project has historically been pretty lax with commit privileges, probably because the repository is so heavily watched upon that you probably couldn't do much harm with it. Most other projects would have removed privileges when someone steps down.

"Core" is a piece of software and can not change its mind.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:54:12
There are, because Linus allows them to. And as long as Satoshi were around that were true there as well.
So far, the situation is quite simple as there is a clear lineage from Satoshi to the current developers. The chain of maintainers is unbroken, Satoshi handed over to Gavin and Gavin handed over to Wladimir. The blockchain is unbroken, there are no rule changes that you are forced to go along with or lose your money. Your own your Bitcoin in a true cryptographic sense of the word. No other project can make a serious claim that they are, in fact, Bitcoin.
This might not always hold true however, and we may very well end up in a situation where the lineage is in dispute. It is easy to imagine multiple incompatible hard forks in a situation where the original chain dies for some reason, for example due to a bug in the consensus code that can be exploited. That would be interesting, especially if Satoshi is still alive and cares about the project. It's absolutely one of those risk factors you have to take into account when investing in Bitcoins.

"Control" only means the power to censor. Miners can not steal funds. Miners can not create more than 21M coins. Not even at 51% power.

There are not two "sides" here. There are as many opinions as there are Bitcoin developers. That's why people generally practice this thing called "peer review" which in the best case can lead to "consensus" about the protocol.
The only reason people speak in terms of two sides, is because they want to merge one hundred Bitcoin developers to "one side" and then present another party (themselves, quite often) as the other side. That way any argument can be met with "that's what _that_ side says".
Are there two sides to Bittorrent development as well?

Doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't they push for a blocksize increase then, instead of this EC nonsense?
Nobody can even explain how EC would lead to an increase, except for proposals that start with "all miners come together and...", in which case the EC mechanism is useless.
BU-pushing miners want to get rid of Bitcoin Core, and replace it the development team with their own. They don't oppose segwit on technical grounds, they just make a point of not including any functionality from the past two years because if they merged changes from upstream, Core developers would still be indirectly in control over these.
All those superficial renaming changes that looked like political statements in BU is not. They are technical changes to make merges burdensome. Sometimes you have to call a spade a spade.
Falkvinge is watching from the sidelines, just like you and me. He has no connections among miners or insight in BU development. He was very vocal about how Bitcoin was overvalued by an order of magnitude when it was in the hundreds of dollars (which was based on a back of the envelope calculation with no way to check its validity), sold it all and recommended everyone else to do the same. I don't know if he bought back, or if he's looking to do it.

EB/AD is not backwards compatible in the way segwit is, at least not in any obvious way. So I don't think it could be deployed without a hard fork of the blockchain.


Segwit is a sort of extension block, so the statement is trivially true. Or did you the EB above had anything to do with extension blocks? I can see how one can be confused.

Fascinating. But it opens up more questions than it answers.
* What is the relationship between Jiang and Jihan?
* Where did they find 1200 GH (!!) on such short notice? Surely that must be more than just Jihan withholding shipments and mining on those? Which is not unrealistic of course as that has happened before, but it could at best only explain parts of it.
* Why did they put so much resources into blocking segwit on Litecoin in the first place? The theory that if segwit activates on Litecoin it would help deployment on Bitcoin isn't believable. To begin with, there is no one left to sway. All developers and pretty much all businesses wants segwit (or something pretty much identical to it). But also, and I say this with the utmost respect to Charlie Lee and others who are both competent and nice, Litecoin isn't _really_ that important. If anyone wanted to point to other segwit activations, there are plenty to choose from.
* Why the hard fork fetish? It is incomprehensible to me, and it was been a constant theme with BU supporters as well. They say it's more "clean", which is a very strange thing to say with even the most trivial technical insight, and any real reason is far from obvious. If segwit hinders covert asicboost, it does so no matter how you activate it. Is it just that they know developers to be wary of risking other people's money in a hard fork so they hope to branch out discussion in general in order to delay it further?
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:27:47


Why would you say that? Could you be a little more specific, so we aren't lost in analogies here.
Of course it will need more storage and bandwidth space than leaving the 1MB limit in. Because it allows for bigger blocks and more transactions per block. But one single transaction doesn't require more storage space than before, not in any meaningful way.
Or are you arguing some technicality that some index would need to grow larger in the database? Those things should be left as implementation details and not affect protocol development.

This is something every technology has to battle with, it's constantly being sold to people who love tech but doesn't necessarily understand it using words and values to make it sound impressive.
We see it with computers, with mobile phones, with hifi equipment, with everything- Between a 1GHz and a 2GHz processor, the latter is obviously better right? Well, I could easily make a 40GHz processor! But it wouldn't be better at all, it would be worse in every aspect that matters (performance and power consumption). I could make a camera with 400 megapixels, no problem. In fact, we already see a lot of cameras with much more pixels than the noise makes useful.
Take a good old sports car. A 4.0 litre engine is powerful, right? So why doesn't Porsche make a 4000.0 litre engine? Because it would be rather useless to propel a car with.
With software there's no manufacture to worry about. You could easily make a 1000MB blockchain. Would it be useful?
Bitcoin has weaknesses, such as the quadratic validation. That's a real attack vector that makes scaling difficult. UTXO fragmentation is another. Spam is another, of which there are several types and it's getting worse. The many open problem around Bitcoin is what makes it so fascinating. Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency, it's the only one large enough to have scaling problems, and it's the only one decentralized enough to have governance problems.
So if you want to speak about Bitcoin's problems, please do but speak about any of the many real ones. Not by pointing at a constant in the source code. That one will not matter if the other ones are not fixed.
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:14:26
Not in the same way. When enough miners set the version bit, every node on the planet sees that and activates the functionality. All that will happen when you "spoof" the version bit is that functionality will activate too early. Probably not what you intended.
Coinbase strings is public graffiti in the blockchain that only mining pools can set. That can be anything. "McAffee for president" or Catholic prayers, it's all the same and carries no significance for node behaviour.
There are certain public services, such as Coindance, where you can browse these messages. But the fact that some mining pools signal for incompatible proposals simultaneously, such as b2x and classic, should tell you how serious they take it. Very much like graffiti, which will make these governance conflicts visible for all eternity (well, as long as at least one bitcoin node is running).

If we are to trust the facts as presented here, Jihan is competing with his customers and giving himself an unfair advantage. They don't know this. If they did, that would have made a difference. Nobody is suggesting you should panic (what does that even mean?) but it's kind of a big deal.
It also presents a plausible explanation to the seemingly illogical behaviour to block some development work with explanations that doesn't make sense technically.

If 38% of mining power (not miners, mind you) are asking to lift the 21M coin limit, would you advocate to provide it too?
Because make no mistake, that's something they'd like. More than a measly 38% of miners would want that, and it's only going to get more and more accepted to speak about as the next halvening comes closer.
After all, miners invested so much in electricity and hardware! Surely they're entitled to a bit more reward than a silly 6.25 btc? Also, miners have all the power, and they should decide new features, or at least vote on them .. and every other argument that you've already heard a thousand times.
EB/AD specifically is a game of signalling and orphaning other miner's mined blocks. Those who lose are not accounted for in the next difficulty adjustment. It's frankly bizarre, and nobody has explained convincingly how it would lead to bigger blocks unless a majority is colluding (which we normally want to avoid). Even if it did, we know enough about the protocol characteristics to realize the value is a tradeoff, primarily against validation time, that merits rigorous study, not testing in production until it crashes.
Even in the best case where the colluding miners are all benevolent and everyone plays nice and decides not to exploit the situation, transactions would take a very long time to go through. Nobody knows how long, only that its way more than the current 6 confirmations. So even if it doesn't crash, it would be less useful and the exchange value would suffer.
Not a single user asked for any of this. (Except for one or two famous people on Twitter, who wants both this and zero-conf transactions. Too bad the wishes must at least make logical sense in the real world.) Users want that no one double spends their transactions. Users want no downtime. Users want more capactity and cheaper transactions.
There's an endless amount of practical reasons why miners should not design the protocol and its rules. No matter if 38 or even 99% of miners want the change, that doesn't matter. They should go through the same peer review as everyone else. And anything that threatens end user funds or transaction integrity should be rightfully vetoed straight away. This is real people and real money we're playing with.

That's silly on the face of it, as you are obviously here and talking about it _right_ _now_. And that "web forum" is there BU was _born_.
But none of that makes any sort of difference whatsoever, because _zero_ development takes place on reddit or the web forum. Development takes place on the mailing list and the irc channels where that kind of moderation doesn't even exist. You have to be able to write coherently and logical and express yourself in a technical manner, but the worst that could happen in that you get ignored.

It won't. Bitcoin has never stood still for any considerate amount of time. Sooner or later there will be some feature in Bitcoin the miners want and they will upgrade.
Blocksize isn't the only thing that's held back if miners won't upgrade their version of the Bitcoin software. No new features can be rolled out. But that's always been the case, miners are notoriously slow to upgrade.
But difficulty keeps increasing, and people come and go. The mining community looks different from one year ago, and very different from two years ago. Even if a large provider of mining equipment has some sort of political stance of only running a heavily patched two year old version of Bitcoin today, that is not likely to be the case next year.

It does, but I don't think the "just" is justified. It's a simple way to avoid a lot of issues, and now that you can run a pruning walletless core it's a lot more lightweight than before.
I've heard good things about libbitcoin, but that's only half the solution. You need a good client protocol, and a good decentralisation story too, otherwise every little speedbump along the way becomes your own problem to solve.
Electrum looks like an apparent godo fit, since their use case looks very much like a subset of yours, but I'm just waving hands with no knowledge of the issues involved. Why you guys don't use the same protocol is probably one of the most common questions you get.

The main problem I have with Ethereum is that it doesn't scale. Not just like Bitcoin doesn't scale, but really doesn't. They don't have shortage of ideas (let's do sharding), but of proposals, and you can't review or critique what doesn't exist.
Bitcoin is at the proposal stage. Not much traction yet, but a clear view of what technical fundamentals are required and every year brings us closer to that. And since there are many disparate interests in the Bitcoin community, things must take time. There is no central foundation or company that can unilaterally decide things.

Did someone suggest they were? That's taking the conspiracy theories a little too far, imho.
That said, I don't see the point of this particular Extension Block proposal. I mean, it's bascially Segwit. Only Segwit is ready today, has had its fair share of peer review, all the nooks and crannies of interactions with other proposals mapped out. Pretty much every Bitcoin software and many wallets have implemented it. The new address format is standardized. It's been interoperability tested on testnet for half a year.
Extension Blocks looks nifty and all, but at this point I think it must offer some big improvement on Segwit if the intent is to replace it.

I love how they think the chain splits are no problem because "the pools will unite and kill it". As if mining was the only important use of Bitcoins. Never mind actual economic transactions, double spending, and people losing their money while that attack takes place.

While that idea is a lot more straightforward and easier to reason about than EC, to say that "the only effect is" is careless and false. The limit was put in there for a reason. It's likely not optimal in value, but removing it wholesale is ignoring a problem.
One likely outcome would be that a miner would put enough transactions of such a nature that while all competitors are busy validating them instead of mining the next block. In the event that miners would generate bigger blocks, which they probably won't as to keep fees high, it would also enable other denial of service attacks and other abuse such as graffiti in the blockchain stored for all eternity. This used to be a problem but went away with higher fees. But now we have high fees instead.

You completely skipped the part where BU will lead to an increase. Which is a bit surprising since the very simplest understanding of the incentives behind it would indicate that it likely won't. (It's also a bit rough that you pretty much have to read the source code to understand what those incentives are. There is no paper and no analysis of this. And the only documentation is more like historical background how it used to work.)
Supporters of BU, except for Gavin, can never explain how this is supposed to work, just downvote and move on. The developers (and Gavin) seems to think miners will all come together and do coordinated changes only for the good of the network and that nobody malicious will try to game the system. The motivation would be long term gains in Bitcoin value. Not only do I not think cryptocurrencies should be based on trusting the actors in general, but also that there are recent examples of the opposite. We have seen Twitter messages that seems designed to make the reader give up all hope, but the next day the same account gives an opposite message.
I can also not help thinking that if only coordinated and well planned changes will be made with BU, then the signalling functionality is completely unnecessary and we could just hard fork instead. Coordinating consensus changes is the hard problem to solve here.
But block size is a red herring to BU development which was designed to replace all open source developers, initially with a small payrolled team but later anyone who applied and got accepted by said team.
If someone genuinely thought the signalling functionality was a realistic way to increase transaction throughput, they would develop that feature on top of bitcoind. BU instead is an over two year old version of Bitcoin where care has been taken to change symbols to make merging of newer features a manual and labour intensive process. The idea being that forcibly replacing developers is not enough if you merge their features, in which case they would still be influencing development.


Please, could everyone just s/Core/Bitcoin-Qt/ before posting? If it sounds silly, it probably is. There are many people worrying about centralization, but a piece of software surely can't be.
I'm personally not that concerned, but that's just because I see several problems that we will have long before centralization ever becomes a problem. It is much to easy to disrupt the Bitcoin network, for example. Some people are working on this, but I'm not so I try to not complain when I'm not helping. Open source software projects are tough enough to work with as they are.
Some aspects around segwit, including the much bigger blocksize, was indeed worrying to me too. There were criticisms raised on the mailing list, and the proposal had to change accordingly. I am absolutely not competent enough to decide when it is good enough, but I don't know of anything that is not least bad compared to the alternative proposals.


We've had this discussion for several years now. It seems to be rough consensus on the mailing list that there should be possible to do a soft fork to do away with the hard cap as it is designed right now, and double capacity straight away. From the lessons learned we should know what went good and bad and plan the next capacity increase accordingly.
There is also groundwork being laid to have several soft forks "in the air" in parallel. That should decrease the likelyhood that one planned feature blocks future changes. This would make not only capacity increases but also other changes much easier to roll out in the future. Sadly, that part is the one which seems to be the most problematic.


This belief is not grounded in technical facts. It is a feeling, that someone likely has a self interest in spreading to you. The past two years of changes to the bitcoind software, will not only increase performance and thereby allowing for bigger blocks, but also present mechanisms as to how those future changes are deployed.
To know more about all the development that takes place in the Bitcoin community, a good start would be to read the excellent summaries of the IRC meetings that are published from time to time. That gives an overview of the many interests that are represented and how far along new features are. Segwit is really only a small part of all that is being done.
The next step would be to read the mailing list directly. Many of the discussions are interesting to anyone who is technically inclinded. And it is an effective way to kill the myth that blocksize increases and other capacity changes would somehow be "off limits" to discuss. That is open to anyone who wishes to participate, just be prepared that beliefs and feelings needs to be backed by facts, and always be interested to learn from those who genuinely know this stuff. I think I know the protocol basics by now but I absolutely learn something new every week.

bcoin is listed as segwit ready. Is that not true?
@_date: 2017-04-27 10:00:25
That's what people said when Litecoin was started. Bitcoins for holdings, Litecoins for daily purchases. Turns out it's not very convenient for that and even five years later no payment processors supports it. Bascially exchange fees dwarfs transaction fees. End user wallets can't make this process very transparent to the user. Better to have a proper sidechain in that case, and all transactions can be denominated in bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-04-01 16:15:21


I don't believe that for a second. There are plenty of experiemtal forks of Bitcoin that implements blocksize increases, including Classic and XT. They would at least give us a predictable blocksize increase.
Instead of a predictable blocksize increase BU has some signalling game that may or may not lead to a blocksize increase. That is not something anyone desperate for bigger blocks would support. I suspect it is more of a way to counter the planned blocksize segwit gives. They can't have segwit because a Blockstream developer worked on it, so it's more like a way of saying "we have a plan to change the blocksize too! segwit only gives 2MB but we can give up to 200MB so we have the bigger numbers".


If anyone is truly desperate for on-chain scaling, they would want to accelerate the segwit schedule. That is the on-chain scaling proposal that is can be activated in production in the shortest time. Even in the best case where everyone would suddenly agree, any of the hard fork scenarios above would take longer to prepare for. Between those three options, all other have a clear way to bigger blocks.
Key here is the latter part of the sentence. They don't trust "Core", the open source Bitcoin project, period. For one of many possible reasons.


I think there are many different reasons that people support BU. It is obvious why the biggest miners support them, as the replacement development team is if not under their direct control then at least sympathetic to them. It is also no coincidence that the most vocal proponents are also big alt-coin proponents. Any threat of attacks or hard forks is a sure way to influence the price. "China Bans Bitcoin, This Time For Real" just doesn't cut it anymore.
But there are probably many others, with as many reasons as there are people. Some other people just want to stir up controversy, some people believe the conspiracy theories and some people just have a tendency to root for the underdog. There are very few (zero?) long term Bitcoin holders and entrepreneurs among the supporters apart from the ones directly in control (the Developer, the President, the Pool Operator etc). Make no mistake, none of them support it because they think it is the most quick way to increase blocksize, because between Classic and segwit there's no worldview under which that is true, the value is in owning the Bitcoin specification.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:12:16
It just means "anyone who receives payment in bitcoin", so there's really no need to quantify. The idea is that if everyone who buy bitcoin or sells something for bitcoin suddenly decides that non-segwit are invalid, no miner would want to mine them because they will be essentially worthless.
That's the general idea. Whether it works in practice remains unclear, at best. Hard forks are problematic. Any time two parties on the Bitcoin network diverges in rule consensus, that can potentially be taken advantage of to steal bitcoins. Segwit has taken steps to mitigate that somewhat, but even that is not perfect, and that is why the 95% threshold was put in.
@_date: 2017-04-03 10:48:09
Apart from the obvious one then, segwit? That's a pretty large capacity increase that can deployed in a fairly straightforward scenario.
Capacity, performance and resilience are also intricately linked. One can not improve without the others.
@_date: 2017-04-04 11:30:29
Were you here a year ago to say exactly the same thing about the CSV softfork?
No? Then why do you believe this is different? Sometimes it is useful to argue specifics, otherwise opinions are just that.
This could not have been done years ago, because segwit didn't exist then. Developers are not always the most careful people with regards to changes but Bitcoin community is. A failed deployment isn't catastrophic in the sense data corruption, a hard fork or extended downtime is. It can always be done again.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:38:42
The development community can be toxic at times, no doubt about that. But I think it's important that, when soliciting feedback on a proposal you wrote, to not write long medium articles filled with drama about that the one or two nasty responses you received and instead focus on the more factual questions and review that came up.
Admittedly, most of the discussion is rehashed old stuff from when extension blocks was proposed, but it's still an important part of peer review to be able to answer those. Especially since extension blocks is an old idea and it's not at all clear what's different with their proposal.
We already know more than we'd like on the more colourful personalities in this community. Please see through that and focus on the technical feedback. Please.
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:44:11


That's a rather extreme view of changes should be made. The discussion is worth having, but the statement as it stands is almost absurd. It is not unreasonable that a majority of the miners would to cancel or postpone the next halvening. I think most users would answer that with a resounding "no" as it is simply too far from the Bitcoin we invested in.
Miners have invested a lot of dollars (or yuan) in hardware, but most it is a business and they are selling what they mine. Companies formed around Bitcoin have an order of magnitude more invested, and end users are more invested still. And those are the ones holding Bitcoin.

"No difference" between a momentary value and its allowed maximum? No difference between network packet size and MTU? No difference between the speed of an unladen swallow and the speed of light in vacuum?
I guess you somehow mean metaphorically, but it's really hard to understand what you're getting at. The six things I listed was just examples of what would need to be adjusted for if consensus rules (including maxblocksize) were not constant across the network. There are surely others, if that's your point.

Can we please restore the name to Bitcoin-Qt? I understand the reasons behind the change, but it didn't turn out well. I'm getting tired of this "core did this" rhetoric. We'd never have the same problem with "Bitcoin-Qt signed the HK agreement" because it would be absurd at face value.
They'd have to say "Blockstream did this" or "Greg promised that". Which could be shown to be true or false, but it least it would be clear who were involved. Now it seems like if I run a full node, or even worse if I got a patch accepted, I somehow have to defend some agreement that I wasn't part of.

It's called a 51% _attack_ for the reason it is an attack on the network's rules. It Bitcoin was a democracy in the sense that the majority (of hashpower) was correct we would call it a decision, not an attack.
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:34:45


I dare you to substantiate that claim, from the perspective of a miner. They buy their hardware with perhaps a six month return in mind. The difficulty increase only allows for that.


With economic incentives. Since all full nodes enforce protocol, such a patch would be a very expensive exercise in futility. This has already happened, while clearly not on purpose, so there's really no need to delve in speculation.


With software, yes, but not with protocol extensions. Is this really up for debate? It would clearly have been beneficial for miners to postpone the halvening (after all it clearly ruined at least one big company in that space), and they are clearly not stupid enough to patch their software to change consensus rules.

The Bitcoin name was already very overloaded, the protocol, the blockchain, the currency and the software was all named that. Capital B only differentiates so much. So the change to "-Qt" was a little bit easier to understand.
But, sure, I'd also prefer it to "Core". That name is constantly confusing instead. It's also a little bit to close in meaning to a cabal of sorts. It was a bad idea that I hope we can fix someday. But as they say, "naming and cache invalidation ...".

That can be regarded as causation. It is _because_ the non-mining nodes stick to the original chain that the attacker's chain have little value.


That would depend entirely on the nature of the split, what kind of merge mining is possible and so on.
In the extreme case where the fork is an altcoin in every sense of the term, it is not different than for example when Litecoin or Ethereum was bootstrapped. Even if a vast majority of hash power stayed behind on Bitcoin, that did not make the altcoin less secure in any reasonable sense of the word. And perhaps the comparison is more apt with the altcoins that kept Bitcoins PoW.
Sure, the mining majority could attack the weaker chain, but why would they? They make more money mining on it. So the chain is protected by economic incentives, exactly as Bitcoin was protected by economic incentives two years ago when hashpower was an order of magnitude less than today. A 51% attack on Bitcoin wasn't impossible two years ago because the amount of hash power was some kind of limited, finite resource that could only be distributed among the altcoins. Hash power is manufactured, and how much you have at your disposal is simply a matter of cost.
Withholding attacks is a real thing, but I think we need to be very clear about exactly which attacks are possible, under what scenarios, and at what cost. I don't think it's quite as trivial as "easily obliterating" a minority chain. Those attacks have real costs.


I think we are in violent agreement about this. What's up for discussion is how easy the possible attacks really are, and what could possibly be gained from them.

Wallets can't estimate fee properly, which this subreddit should be a clear example of. Every day there are fairly accomplished users complaining that their transaction didn't confirm ("but I set a fee of X dollars", yeah, that doesn't help when you're spending dust).

Most people with a CS background know what "turing complete" is, and they know what "stateful" means. But "rich statefulness", that's just a made up word. I guess it means more states than something else, but there are no absolute values here. So my guess is that it's very close in meaning with the previous selling point "turing complete".
It used to be the DAO that was the killer feature for ETH. Now it's provably fair gamling. Which is a bit strange, 
considering it was one of the first applications of Bitcoin apart from payments. The code is potentially useful and it's not obviously a scam like so many other coins. But it's very hard to understand what the complex state machine even has to do with provably fair gamling.

Well, it's a lot more likely than 95% of mining power behind any other candidate. Any capacity increase would require consensus to avoid any unfortunate interactions behind those who validate the change and those who don't.
How much supermajority is required can be discussed, that's just the developers being very careful with other people's money, but that's another discussion altogether.
(And yes, I don't think I find it as unlikely as you do. Miner upgrades have always lagged behind. Sooner or later miners will want to upgrade, because of some new functionality. We don't see them upgrading but disabling segwit, that would be different.)

A variable max blocksize would be a very fundamental change to Bitcoin. I don't know what the impact would be, but I expect any proposal that expects people to take it seriously to begin with a comprehensive review of that.
I would also wish for it to answer the simplest question of all: Why have a max if it's variable? Must there not be a max max blocksize then? And in that case, why not just use that value as the max blocksize, and avoid the above complexities? After all, miners are always free to mine smaller blocks to their liking.

It would be great if the article could clarify Antminers response:


The URL is hard coded in the firmware, to a server under Bitmain's exclusive control. If "owners of the Antminers" would want to stop mining remotely, they would use the administrative interface. In order to use this "feature" to stop mining, they would have to turn to Bitmain and ask them to shut it down.
The remote trigger is hard coded into the firmware for everyone. There is no option to disable it. Only Bitmain controls the server. This part about the vendor response could be a bit clearer in the article.

If miners have "the biggest economic incentive to keep Bitcoin honest, immutable and healthy scaling and growth", why doesn't a single one of them pay for development?
Instead of crying that a software company with $80M investment (or whatever) pays for a couple of developers, why not pay for one or two yourself? And I mean the open source way, someone who is already in the project, knows the code and protocol intimately, and fund them for whatever they think is valuable for the project. 
Especially if you self describe as the "most invested" part of the community, which would place your investment in the hundreds of million. Surely payrolling a full time developer isn't much for you when it's the only thing that keeps an open source project viable for a forseeable future?

Look, before we start with the obvious. This is not the way to have a technical discussion. "Why are the developers so opposed", "the weight of hatred for the other side", insinuating your post will be removed etc.This is not what somebody who wants to learn more would say. That is mostly pandering to achieve an emotional reaction. I know that's what Reddit thrives on, but let's not have any of that.
There are no two sides. There's Bitcoin the open source project. That development does not take place on Reddit. Reddit is for trolling and overusing the c-word. If you have some proposal on how to extend Bitcoin, make your technical argument there, and if you have enough sway with your peers you may get the privilege to work your ass off to see your proposal meet reality while nobody thanks you. But it's pretty cool, and that's par for the course for any open source project, unfortunately.


Your wallet is most likely broken. The huge backlogs we see from time to time leads to higher fees, but it doesn't lead to delays for transactions with a high enough fee. But fee estimations are not standardized among wallets, some do it exceptionally bad (people keep complaining about Blockchain.info, whose wallet stays popular in spite of being broken in numerous ways). We also see transactions on the network specifically designed to raise fee estimation.
This situation is unfortunate, to say the least. There should be something done to fix it. We need cooperation between wallets. We need a redesign of the fee market. We need to decrease the amount of unwanted transactions. These are real problems, and they need to be known and understood in detail before Bitcoin can get more popular.
I actually use Bitcoin, not daily but often enough. There's been a few cases where transaction backlog was a problem, especially during the "stress tests" people have spoken a lot about. Bitcoin payments are slow by design and even when the network was under no pressure it always took an hour for the desired six confirmations. Variance can lead to two or even three hours. Large backlogs doesn't change this more than variance does, but it drives up fees which is a problem in itself.


Hard forks are the most dangerous thing there is. As soon as there is a rule change we run the risk of two nodes not agreeing, and that can be exploited to double spend or steal people's money. Keeping other people's money safe is the prime directive of Bitcoin. No change can ever risk that.
And foocoin can fork every week for all I care. Nobody pays their bills with Monero. It's like saying Bitcoin could have hard forked in 2011 and that wouldn't have been dangerous. Even in 2013 when there was a panic change in Bitcoin, the change was made to stay bug compatible with an old version in order to avoid an the hard fork that already had formed. It was the right thing to do in retrospect, but in that short time period people lost money. That's not acceptable.


Again, cut out the conspiracy theories. Most active developer agrees with the proposal to increase block size with a soft fork. That change was made with the lessons learned from CSV and P2SH in mind. Perhaps that was a mistake in retrospect, feel free to criticize that. The hive mind that is the Bitcoin community learns from its mistakes.


Again, the prime directive of Bitcoin should be: be very careful with other people's money. Avoid downtime. Avoid data corruption. Avoid hard forks.
If you want to make some fundamental change to the blockchain, chain it to a new genesis block. If that turns out to be successful, Bitcoin can either copy the feature, or you can watch those tokens become much more valuable than Bitcoin. Let the market sort it out!


Before we can do that we must know what a reasonable blocksize _is_. How much of today's transactions are spam? How much are there to drive up fees? What causes empty blocks, apart from propagation delay? How does validation scale? Can we get rid of the quadratic validation problem? How is block propagation impacted by bigger blocks? Let's discuss technical questions when we have the most rudimentary knowledge about how the system behaves.

There are no goalposts. We are not debating.
If consensus parameters, including (but not limited to), maxblocksize _varies_ over the network (i.e. is not constant), that would make many previously held assumptions in Bitcoin network software as well as user facing wallets false.
Any suggestion for changes along those lines would need a credible plan to find out what those assumptions are, what further changes are required, and how to best make them, in order to be taken seriously.

The amount moved is irrelevant to the fees paid. This could equally well have been "$0.10 moved for $0.37" in order to attract upvotes from "Bitcoin is useless as a payment system and probably a bubble"-people. Or it could have been phrased "$23000 moved for $0.37" to illustrate the use as a cheap cross-border payment system for those who already believe.
Is $0.37 high or low fees? Is $3.7? Or $0.037? The boring answer is that it depends on your use case. Retail end users might opt for their Visa with cashback bonus every time, so daily retail might not be the best use case.

No, you can not claim authorship of someone else's work. Software licensing does not come into question. I do not understand why you keep repeating that. Especially since the license gives you no such explicit right. In many countries that wouldn't carry legal weight even if you wanted to.
It is not the license that forbids you to falsely claim authorship. It is copyright law. And the most basic tenets of copyright at that, one that has been codified in law since before modern copyright and by international agreement enforced in most of the world's countries.
Ask anyone with the most rudimentary familiarity of copyright.

I have not seen the claim that the license requires specific line by line authorship attribution. That argument would clearly explain why you keep obsessing over the license.
Can you perhaps be more specific and link to that claim?
From the linked conversation it seemed to be that the original author accused someone else of falsely attributing authorship. That's something completely different from not adhering to how attribution should be done. Did I misunderstand?
The specific quote that leads me to understand this is the opening one, which says someone "wholesale copied [the work] while affixing his name and stripping off the name of the change's author".
Now you can claim that the accusation is false because the person did not in fact do this. But you can _not_ claim that this is allowed by the software license. You can also not claim that the issue is in fact something else entirely.

You keep repeating the license the software is used under, as if that was relevant. It is not.


Where have you seen the argument that the false claim was being made at the top of the source code files? I have not.


The commits themselves. They clearly are under copyright. And they too are files, even if that is not relevant to the argument being made.
It is not the attribution of the committer that was changed but of the author. Author and committer are different concepts in git, and git tracks both.
It is also not true that this is just how git works. A simple rebase of the commits to the new reposity would have kept the author tag intact. This was either done on purpose or by someone who doesn't know how to use git.


Now we're getting somewhere. It can be argued that this was not done with the intent to remove authorship. And that may be true. Is it illegal to change those lines? That would very much depend on intent. The change was made, that much is clear.
However, regardless of legal implications, the decent thing to do when the original author of the work asks you politely not to change those lines, is to not change those lines.

You are looking at the packed database format. That is going to be a binary representation of the same data.


It is, but this is not "some code". This is a commit, lifted verbatim from the upstream repository. You simply don't copy and paste them.
The only possibility to cut and paste in the way you describe would be to extract the changes introduced in these commits, manually apply them, and them include them in commits of your own. This is a convoluted way to work, but is the only way I can think of that would result in yourself being set as the author by default. Github includes tooling for merging commits from the upstream repository, and none of this would result in the author field being changed.
And no, I don't know how specifically how Sechet did what he did. Furthermore, I do not know if he did it out of malice or incompetence.
I am only stating what is being claimed by the presumably original author in the ticket.
There was also the counterargument that this was just a lie and no authorship data was modified, which is clearly false, and alternatively that this was somehow allowed by the license, which is also false.

Authorship claims are not regulated by the licensing. That's not how copyright works.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:26:01
Again you reply to something that is easier to respond to than what is actually being said.
I have not argued this is case of false authorship. That is for a court to decide. I have said that is the _argument_ being made.
You have repeatedly stated that if you abide to the software license, you can not be in breach of copyright. I have given numerous examples of why this is not the case. I don't know why you keep repeating something which is trivially false by counter example.
False authorship can not be allowed for by the MIT license. It is simply not a question of licensing, but of copyright. I have pointed at which specific article in Berne Convention where these rights are defined. These are facts, and not my "position". That nobody else seems to find this controversial should perhaps be a clue to ask someone you trust, other than yourself, with familiarity of copyright law.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:40:18
Why is the rebase so complicated? Wasn't s2x/btc1 supposed to be a simple one-line change?

@_date: 2017-09-12 17:20:26
Again, the license is irrelevant. Authorship is one of the basic foundations of copyright law. Most countries won't even legally allow you to explicitly allow it by license. Educate yourself by reading the Berne Convention, it isn't long, especially article 6 which deals with attribution. Then you can read your local law which implements this directive. This has nothing to do with software licensing.

I have now checked the files. It does clearly state:
"Author: Amaury SECHET"
immediately followed by a non-trivial work in C++ which someone else claims to be the actual author of.
If the claim is true, I can clearly see the argument being made. Would it hold up in court? That would depend on other things, but they would absolutely understand the argument.


There are numerous things that are illegal regardless of what the license says. Please at least acquaint yourself with copyright law before making statements about it.

The hard part is knowing that 7F9470E6 is really ThomasV and not some impostor who just hacked Electrum's web page and put their own key id there. The only way to be sure is to go to some Bitcoin meetup and sign someone's key, and hope this someone perhaps went to a conference and signed Peter Todd who in turn have signed ThomasV. Not many people do that however, because it entails real world work.
Just verifying the signature alone is still better than just verifying md5sums as long as you keep your GPG wallet around. Be skeptical if the key listed on Electrum's website changes. You should not have to re-download it until it expires or you see some verified forum post that explains why.
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:42:01


Removal of attribution can absolutely be a form of copyright infringement.


No, that does not follow. Removing the .git repo and then checking in everything _under_ _your_ _name_ might very well be.
(I haven't checked if that is indeed the case here, but it does seem to be the claim at least.)
Claiming authorship of someone else's work is not regulated by the copyright license. It is regulated by copyright _convention_ which is true for all countries that are Berne signatories.
In most countries, even if you sell all your copyrights for a work to a company, they can not claim someone else authored it.
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:02:26


No, it does not. I don't think that is the claim being made.
Git separately stores the Author and Committer (and other metadata such as Reviewer and Tester) for every commit. Copying commits from another project does not by make you the author simply by using git. This tracking is indeed the reason why Github does have a big fork button on every project.
If every commit was indeed copied verbatim, but with the "Author: original_author" removed and "Author: new_author" inserted in its place you could absolutely make the claim that the second person was acting in bad faith. If that is illegal is for a court to decide, but the argument is clear, and it is not based on the software license. The question any laws were broken will be settled on whether the change was made on purpose and in bad faith.
The Linux project does put a lot of legal in that the use of Author (and, in particular, Signed-Off) tags have legal bearing. Signing the tags helps a lot in this regard of course.


Not to claim authorship. I wish people at least had a rudimentary understanding of copyright law before making such statements.
Again, I have not verified what was done here, but I have to correct the idea that the license would somehow allow false authorship claims. The idea that git author tags (if this is what is being referred to) is legally without value must also be argued by facts and not by making things up about copyright law.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:26:52

I cut and pasted from the github repo in question for your convenience.

No, I am most certainly not. I'm not even sure what primality would mean in this context. Each commit is a copyrightable work. The resulting file is also a copyrightable work. This is not an either-or situation, nor is there any reason to state precedence between the two.
I am asserting that the commits are a copyrighted work taken in isolation, and that the claim that misattributing authorship of someone else's commit is a reasonable one to make.
I am not saying it is illegal, that is what courts do, but that the claim is understandable.


Again, this is not remotely comparable as the nodejs maintainers are not copying commits verbatim. I also don't think Google has any reason to cause trouble.
If you look at the nodejs commit log, it does seem that they are indeed keeping not only the author field but also the reviewer field intact. All the unchanged commits are from google.com and chromium.org addresses.
The legality of git authorship and sign-off tracking has been hashed out on the Linux mailing list many times. This is not something new to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:49:20


Again, it is up to the original author to do this. But I take issue with the claim that this didn't happen (it clearly did), or that this was somehow allowed by the license (it isn't).
I have yet to see the claim that a commit is not a copyrightable work, so I take it that bit is uncontroversial.
It would then be uncontroversial to claim copyright infringement upon taking a commit, as published on a mailing list or by the git version control system, and present it as your own. I believe this is the claim being made.


Not by failing to set the author tag, but by deliberately changing it.
If you took the latest commit by Torvalds, changed the author field, and mailed it to the list claiming it as your own you will be sure to find a number of people who agrees with this. Linux takes their authorship tracking very seriously. It would not surprise me if at least some Bitcoin developers did, too.

You can check the git log, or you can check the commits themselves. They are stored as files.
You would have found it had you checked them. (Also, why the convoluted command? You know that there is a -r to grep, right?)


This is only true if you wrote the commit yourself. If you copied the commits, irrespectively if you do it in a single repository or across repositories, git will preserve the author and change the committer.
This is very basic operation of git and what the entire Linux development, where git originated, is based on.
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:38:27
This brings so many questions.
How come replay protection wasn't an issue before? And why is it suddenly a problem?
S2x was such a strange agreement. Some companies decided they were going to run some other software for Bitcoin, and that it was going to use an incompatible block weight and segwit. But how that was going to be achieved, how the fork would be deployed and activated, how addresses and transaction formats were going to be changed, and who was going to maintain this software was kept secret. Or so we ordinary users thought. Many saw this as an agreement behind closed doors where all the details were kept private, but as time passes it looks more and more like there really was no secrecy and the developer on their payroll is free to make it up as he goes along.
This is weird because those details are all developers care about. I think you would be hard pressed to find more than one out of the hundreds of Bitcoin developers that doesn't believe a block weight increase is in Bitcoin's future. What they disagree about is how that change can be done safely, what form an eventual replay protection must take and how far in advance we should prepare. These are things that need to be discussed and passed peer review. Now suddenly replay protection is a problem for some of the signatories? What changed?
And it is tiring to read this tweetstorm from Vaultoro where they play the old "us vs. them" card again. Two camps, the need to compromise, get together, etc. That's far from reality and most people realize that. There are some people who want to leave the Bitcoin open source project, Bitcoin Core, and start some other project for some reason. But that doesn't make them the same "camp". If most users today use "Bitcoin Core-coin", then Ver wants "Bitcoin Ver-coin", Jihan wants "Bitcoin Cash-coin", Barry wants "Bitcoin Digital Currency Group-coin" etc. Sure, Jihan and nChain can use the same arguments to leave Bitcoin, but they are not likely to agree on anything else.
I can draw no other conclusion that some people will just sign anything. Maybe they are lured in by being allowed to play with the big boys for a while. Maybe it's the old adage that "all PR is good PR". I don't know. Please enlighten me if you do.

You don't support "Core" in a debate. Bitcoin-Core, or Bitcoin-Qt as it was previously known, or just Bitcoin before that, is a piece of software.

Yes, the project might be hijacked, or some rich person might buy all developers should they all suddenly want to become wage slaves. But Bitcoin-Qt/Bitcoin-Core would live on somewhere.

No offense (really), but what you feel will at most decide what you do with your own node. To have any sort of effect you need to convince the rest of Bitcoin users and developers to follow your lead. And to do that you need to sell your idea.
The hard fork has been debated before, and will continue to be debated for a while longer until all technical arguments are moot. It is simply how development is being done. This is no special case. Saying that you don't have the time is simply deferring judgement to someone else, in which case someone else will.
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:16:12
The idea is that you can verify that your build matches everyone else's, at which point the build system itself is trustless. As in "don't trust, verify".
The source code still have to be audited at some point, which has its own problems but is at least something we understand the scope of. It's a pretty nifty idea. It's a method that originated with Bitcoin but that Debian ran and it's kind of usable at scale now.
(And one that would be much harder with Docker unless it is redesigned to make for reproducible images. Which was the original point why you should avoid distributing Docker images for Bitcoin specifically. The end user would have to take apart the images to verify gitian signatures, which even fewer people would do than do it today.)

I am not arguing that, which should be clear from my previous comment.


If you copied all commits from said third party library, one by one and in verbatim, with the exception of removing every "Author" tag and replacing it with your own name, are you then falsely attributing authorship?
Most likely yes.

What are you talking about? Censhorship about what, where?
If bitcoin developers really wanted to cause problems for btc1, they would connect to them. A lot. But we don't see them doing that. Rather the opposite.
If the network is ever partitioned on purpose you would want to have most connections to your own kind. Otherwise relaying blocks will be very unreliable and in worst case even cause islands of connectivity. This would be worst for the partition with the lesser number of nodes, and right now that is btc1 by orders of magnitude.
There's no way you could twist this into being "censorship". Unless exactly every node in the network upgrades to 0.15, and no btc1 developer or supporter runs their own bitcoin nodes, this can only stabilize the minority network.

No, now you are misrepresenting again. The author did not ask not to change _any_ lines. The author did ask that when copying commits in verbatim, not to change the "Author" tag.


If the information is not included in the zip link, then that is trivially true. It is also not relevant to the claim, as I understand it.


No, it does not. The version control system in question does not default the author tag when you are copying commits. Only the committer tag is set to the user's name. The author tag is kept intact unless you take specific care to change it, or if you extract the diffs line by line and apply them manually. The end result is the same.

What is the basis for this argument? You have stated your conviction but not the reason.
Especially in this particular case, where the original author(s) are not listed in the copyright notice itself, but in the Author tags themselves, intentionally manipulating them does certainly look problematic.


You are absolutely right. I searched the wrong material. US law does not include moral rights, but that doesn't mean you are free to declare someone else's work your own. That much is clear from article 6 of the Berne Convention, which the US has ratified.
I made half an attempt of searching the right material, but the mere volume of acts involved in US copyright law made this difficult. I would think however that the fact that you are not allowed to claim authorship of someone else's work is not a controversial one.
I also don't think that the US implementation is the relevant one, as this is not where dedalnix is based. International convention stipulates this is what matters.

"Non compliant" in this context simply means the nodes in the opposite network partition. The situation is perfectly symmetrical, with the sole exception of one partition being larger than the other. Why would any one partition make it _harder_ to find nodes of your kind? That's in nobody's interest.
If you want to attack the opposing side, the strategy would rather be to connect to as many of those nodes as possible, to fill up their connection slots.


This does not make sense. It is in both sides' interest to be able to identify nodes of their own kind. Preferrably before the split.
Can we go back to the name Bitcoin-Qt please? Core seems to be ambigous, as it is a piece of software that makes no decisions of its own. The Bitcoin-Qt developers can only control their own software, and the decision to peer with its own kind is rational. As is the decision by Btc1 developers to do the same, the details of which is alluded to in the linked issue tracker.

Because it was never more true than the similar claim that some 80% of all users supported it. Which was made because some 80% of users have a web wallet with a company that supports the agreement. This somehow gives them the right to decide what Bitcoin is on behalf of all their users apparently
The reality is that a wallet company that would switch out all their users BTC for some other coin would quickly find themselves without any users at all. (Also, coincidentally, on the receiving end of a class action suit.)
The claim of 95% miner's support was similarly based on the fact that the mining pools where most of the miners are users supports the agreement. Most miners were never invited to the agreement, let alone asked. The pools just claims to speak on the behalf of their users.
The reality, of course, is that mining pools which would end up on a chain that is less profitable to mine than BTC would quickly find themselves without miners.
If you try to ask about these completely illogical statements of support being made in the appropriate forums some people get very upset and downvote or delete your comments. It quickly gets tiresome, but when these basic questions go unanswered it's hard to take the claims seriously.

Ethereum doesn't really have a fee market. It's more like a planned economy where fees are centrally set. Every time there an ICO brings a deluge of transactions every exhange have to shut down their wallets as everything grinds to a halt, instead of raising the transaction fee. There's also the issue of blockchain size.
Ethereum will probably have to implement something like dynamic fees in the future, unless someone figures out a way to shard public blockchains.

What I don't understand is the common idea that because some large percentage of the hash rate decides on something, we should all follow along. These people shook hands at a conference and now we should all run btc1 instead of bitcoind?
Your example of lifting the cap is a good one. I don't think it is a coincidence that the fork talk started brewing around the last halvening, and we'll see it hit with full force before the next one. The argument sort of makes sense, if block size is not a limiting factor in the far future we can't let the halvenings go on if we want to keep miners paid.
If you have arguments for a hard fork, with or without a block size increase, why not take them to the development list and work tirelessly to counter all arguments until it is done? Any change to Bitcoins fundamentals is useless without consensus. Why is it you feel that this particular idea doesn't need to prove itself before being executed? At this point in time it might be a hard sell, but it's certainly not impossible given that these discussions tend to pop up from time to time.

If they have a way to reliably prop up the value of a coin, wouldn't it be much easier to do on some lower volume coin, such as Litecoin? They could make a fortune and not bother with this war metaphor silliness.

To carry this out it would have been useful to have exchanges onboard with the NYA. But only one exchange with any volume to speak of signed, and they have already decided to trade both coins.

That was how other new features, such as P2SH, have been added to Bitcoin. It's a sort of rough consensus on the development list.
There is a potential risk that users that have not upgraded will accept old style transactions which are really invalid under new style rules. (While it would be tempting say "upgrade or lose money", that's unfortunately not how you upgrade global distributed ledgers.) If a supermajority of miners have upgraded before the new rules activates, that would at least make it extremely unlikely that illegal transactions ever make it into a block.
The problems before have been of the sort that miners have flagged readiness without actually validating those rules, either by spv mining or straight out lying, both bad for the network. So the problem was rather that the threshold was too low. Hence 95%.
But in this day and age, where a tweet or the trollbox that Reddit can be can easily move the market cap a billion USD, I think many have realized it's not a viable way to deploy new features anymore. The next big new feature after segwit would need to be deployed in a way that doesn't take more than a year to activate. (No, I don't think anyone takes the risk seriously that we would be stuck with an old version of bitcoin forever.)

Promises about the future are problematic. Large scale mining needs to show ROI in the order of months, investments aren't on a longer time scale than that.

It's not just too short for a hard fork, it's too short for any change.
The code doesn't exist yet. Somebody has to write it. And write tests. And comment on the tests. And re-write it with whatever input was given. People will have technical disagreements and suggest improvements. But we're not there yet. Not only does this not exist, there is no reason to believe the signatories even agree on what they want to do, and how they want to go about it. Expect lots of crapshoots and weasel proposals about some new constant or field ordering, to enable asicboost or whatever other covert technology we don't even know about yet.
This then has to be done for _every_ bitcoin implementation there is. Yes, that includes not only vanilla bitcoin but btcd and libbitcoin and that crappy python thing only used at one exchange you didn't know existed.
Then the testnet has to run the code. Every corner case where these implementations differ in some minute detail must be discovered. Hopefully some really smart people will try to attack it and see that it survives adversarial conditions. _Then_ we are ready to talk deployment, which should be done as to mitigate risks as much as possible. This will also require discussion and testing.
If one exchange, one payment processor, or one wallet either is not onboard with the change or have misunderstood some detail there will be double spending. People will lose money, and trust in bitcoin will plummet. This is not some altcoin with an author who can do whatever with, people actually pay their bills with bitcoin.
I'm no authority on the matter, but I would be skeptical to a 12 month schedule. 4 months seems laughable. Trivial changes have taken longer time than that.

Fitting the Gini coeffecient with Bitcoin addresses. That wasn't even apples to oranges.
You are looking at cold storage addresses. That does not mean a dump is imminent. If those storage addresses suddenly spread out over normal wallets, that would be more concerning. Look at "days destroyed" if you want a metric on this. People have been trying to correlate it with price slumps for a long time, but without much success unfortunately.
In comparison, there are a couple of hundred really big banks. That should not lead you to believe they will dump their holdings in anything.
If you want to worry about exchanges, worry that they are too few, too illiquid, and that too few actually use cold storage addresses as they should.
So it doesn't sound like you're looking at what you think you're looking at. That doesn't mean your conclusions are wrong, just unsupported. I do agree with you that it is likely to be a few whales holding a large share of all bitcoins. I would expect that to be the case because we're all early adopters right now. Bitcoin is mostly speculation at this point, and some can speculate more than others.
Yes, Bitcon is still speculative. That's why it is comparably cheap. If regular people used it we'd see very different valuations. There are more dollar millionaires in the world than there are whole bitcoins in circulation.

I seem to remember price rising on other exchange while stamp was kept still by this gigantic wall. From a casual observer standout it looked like you could have gotten more money for your coins, had you wished. Were you so convinced the market was about to bottom out? Did you sell in panic?

The white paper doesn't concern itself with that. The system didn't exist, nobody was using it, and the value was zero.
As soon as the code was written, there was an implicit block size limit. Probably not on purpose, but it didn't work with blocks larger than some value that I can't remember, but lower than a megabyte. Then as bugs were fixed and bugs were ironed out there was an explicit limit put in place.
Satoshi didn't concern himself with any calculations as to what a reasonable max block size would be, and probably wanted to learn from real world data and change it later. At that time, forks weren't much of a problem, just set a cut off block height and hope everyone upgrades. That was long before the economy was even in the billions.

The biggest problems I see with the NYC agreement is that it _doesn't_ include any economic majority. There's a long list of companies that signed, but most are gambling web pages, mining pools, tiny local players or one-man shows.
The only ones with economic weight behind them are Bitpay and Bitgo. Maybe Xapo. And Bitgo was out before the ink was dry. So Bitpay it is.
_None_ of the big exchanges signed this. So how are you going to exchange your BTC1 coins? There's only so much you can sell on Bitpay. It is clear that all this talk about "80% agreement" and "economic majority" is mostly scare tactics (perhaps inspired by BIP148?) to get the ecosystem onboard. But so far this does not seem very likely.
Then we have BIP148 which run in parallel, and between the two I'm not sure which one the exchanges will support. Maybe both. What a mess.

I can not for my life fit this together, and if there are reasons to believe Gavin was honestly fooled then that would settle it.
I never saw anything other than idle speculation however. It's kind of hard to imagine Gavin choosing a message Satoshi already signed, or even something similar enough that Craig could pull it off. It would have been a high game against overwhelming odds.

It is indeed worrying. But I could create another 100k transactions if you want to be _really_ worried. That's easy to do, and that's the problem. Bitcoin can not and will not scale to every possible thing anyone wants to do with it.
Last time someone looked there was 100k+ document timestamp transaction in the mempool. Yeah, that's going to make it rather expensive for people to buy lunch with it, no matter how you look at it. I think Satoshi Dice was the first application to really stress the blockchain, and things haven't really improved since then.


"Going through" meaning what exactly? Without confirmations you are not safe. The large backlog makes it more expensive to transact using Bitcoin, not slower.
The recommended six confirmations has always taken (at least) one hour, even when Bitcoin was hardly used and block were empty. If you look at the forum you will see that Satoshi tried to deflect talking about "microtransactions", and Gavin always said that Bitcoin probably wasn't for sub-dollar transactions. That was a very conservative estimate.
It's not an easy problem to solve, with a distributed ledger. Some developers has argued to block spam transactions, but nobody really wants to open _that_ can of worms. For several years most seem to put their hope in new types of payment systems. Lightning is the first, but it's still early and no one knows what the future will look like. If anyone knew for sure, the price would either be astronomical or very low.

I think that it's been happening in Bitcoin since before it was clearly happening in Litecoin too. Then Litecoin sort of had the same thing played out in fast forward. We were well into the wild swings and strange tweets that doesn't really make sense. (Threats of 51% attacks etc.) A looming UASF would accelerate the process but I don't think that's very likely with Bitcoin. Feel free to disagree or ridicule me later (or indeed downvote) but while I have no doubt we will reach segwit eventually I have been equally convinced from the start that any shenanigans that can be played out before that, will.

Every time has had its challenges.
Early 2012 you might have been tempted to make a large fpga investment only to find it wiped out by the first asic miners.
But few people did as most waited for the asic providers which were all pre-orders with large backlogs, which if they shipped at all did so much too late. You might well have put your money in Butterfly orders only to find yourself part of the $38M lawsuit in early 2013. If you had personal connections with asic manufacturers in 2012 you would have made money, otherwise not.
Those who held on to their mining revenues did well anyway, if we count dollar value. But compared with just buying and holding it's a losing strategy. Buying continously through all the slumps is the easiest strategy and one that still works.

No, they haven't at all. And this goes way back at least one more year before that. They were against bigger blocks. Then against segwit. Then segwit was ok, but only as a hard fork (which doesn't make sense). Then no segwit, but bigger blocks. The only thing that has been consistent is stalling any form of capacity increase in general and segwit in particular.
I used to believe they did this to keep fees high, but with the reveal of covert asicboost I'm not so sure. It is all part of a bigger play of fighting for influence so I guess they have their own reasons as well. The blocksize debate was perfect to sow discord within the development community so I'm not surprised they are playing all their cards at once.

That was just the most recent example. Read the discussion here:
scroll down a bit for the explanation. The Bitfury CTO knows who the "customer" is who does these. It's a terribly inefficient way of timestamping. They probably paid in excess of $20k just for that batch. They could have just used standard opentimestamp protocol which would have been much cheaper.
Likely the fee is so small for them that they don't care. These are the kind of use cases that prices out everyday payments, and we're only likely to see more of it. Especially with bigger blocks.
There are examples of this every other week. A few weeks before you that the one sending 750 btc every 5 seconds. I don't think anyone found out what that was. Before that there was the Aussies who did e-voting on the blockchain. That backlog took several days to clear.
I'm not entirely onboard with the idea that nothing is spam, there is a fee market and I'm just priced out. (I still want my lunch!) Payments have traditionally been what gave Bitcoin value, and now we're using it for something else. There is no simple answer here, and it's a discussion I think we should be having. Bigger blocks could potentially make this worse. We should probably offer those non-payment use cases (be it gambling on the chain or e-voting) something that is easier to use and does not put so much strain on the blockchain. Sidechains would be one thing worth looking at.

Absolutely, I understand that. (And that is indeed why the big miners support it.) But the calculation behind how much attacker power confirmations are secure against needs to take it into account. I don't know if anyone has looked at it yet.
Anyway, the exact amount is not important, the point here was that the presence distributed singalling system which can potentially drop blocks will affect the required confirmation count. BU users care little about zero confirmation transactions.

It's a tradeoff, but it's not the only tradeoff there is, and it's not linear.
The other day when we had 170k+ transactions floating about, and somebody looked at them it turned out they were mostly transactions to timestamp documents. That tells me our transactions are much too cheap. At the same time recommended fee is $0.8 for an average sized transaction which prices out a lot of use cases. I want to pay my lunch with bitcoins, dammit!
Yeah, we knew the blockchain was useful outside payments, but if those other use cases are more valuable then we have a problem. It might be a problem that's nice to have, but it's a problem. And I'm slightly worried that when we increase transaction capacity by 2-4x, and perhaps even more in the near future, this discrepancy will become ever worse. Demand is much too elastic with capacity.

Not this old horse again. It was dead last year.
Segwit is the objectively fastest, most well tested, and least backwards incompatible way to get bigger blocks. Twice the capacity in one stroke. If you want bigger blocks, this is the way to get it _this_ _year_. There is no possibility you or anyone else could do it any other way before that.
If you are one of those hard fork fetischists, then please make your voice heard where it matters. Not on Reddit.

Even in the event of a minority split, which I haven't heard UASF supporters advocating, that seems like a risky proposition. You risk the whole block reward in order for a chance to steal a transaction. It'd better be big.

And who will maintain btc1 for all eternity? They can't let the community back in, because then btc1 would converge to core.

The economic majority seems to not support this. Only one of the big exchanges is on board. That's worrisome.
Among hash rate there is "intent" to support. Who knows how many will deploy actual support in the allotted time window. Watch how f2pool and bitmain trolled everyone by declaring support both for and against, and in the case of bitmain even their own fork.
Nobody knows where this is going. Anybody who tells you anything with certainty has a bridge to sell.

Avoid doing the split on the Bitcoin chain. Do it instead on the Bitmaincoin chain, where transactions are cheaper. As long as you make sure the transaction is really invalid on the Bitcoin chain, you should be safe. But split it to another key under you control anyway just in case.

I sort of assumed this was something important enough that you would piece together a transaction by hand and push it raw.

It's hard to retort something so vague. "The uncertainty regarding this extreme distribution"? Is it the fact that the distribution is uncertain that valid criticism, or the fact that it is extreme?
The distribution itself is not uncertain. Bitcoin is a completely transparent system. In fact, it has to be, because as a distributed peer-to-peer system anyone needs to be able to 'run the books' and validate that everything is correct.
If the disitribution is extreme or not is kind of hard to argue. There has never been any system like Bitcoin before. We don't know how transactions are distributed between addresses. But I would guess that a few addresses will end up with a large amount of coins. These are the cold storage addresses that exchanges and payment processors use to make their bitcoins impossible to steal. Because that is what you are looking at. I hope you didn't expect it to be something else?
The Gini coefficient has nothing to do with cryptocurrency addresses. That tells us how wealth is distributed between individuals. But we don't know how many addresses any individual holds, because bitcoin is a anonymous system in the sense that there is no reliable mapping to a real world identity. It would be a failing of bitcoin it that was possible.
As Bitcoins have been described value, we would expect value to carry over from other currencies to Bitcoin. It is therefore reasonable to expect that, in the long run, as long as these coins are traded on an open market the wealth distribution would be comparable. Because as long as that market is liquid you could move your wealth freely between stocks, dollars, yen, and bitcoin. But you could never see that on the blockchain. Because with the exception of the big enough investors to hold their bitcoins in cold storage, most wealth would be held in wallets which for privacy reasons consists of many (tens? thousands? we don't know) addresses.

This is my suspicion too, and latency will affect the network in ways I would like to simulate, not think about. But people keep screaming in my face that hard drives are cheap, which is probably the least possible worry with such a change (which might be why they focus on it).
I want to know more about this aspect of the protocol design, but it's really hard. There's no sensible discussion. Reddit really destroyed all means of that, and I never know which ones to keep talking to and which ones are sockpuppets.
There's also this funny idea that this is something you should have an "opinion" on. People go around saying, oh I head this opinion earlier but now I'm swayed by these arguments. What? I don't go about having an opinion about the BitTorrent blocksize (really? 16kB? I could fit that on a piece of paper! increase it!) because it's a tehnical issue. And facts are not affected by my opinion on them.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:20:24
It depends on what you want to do. It's a perfectly valid approach. It's how the halvenings are done, for example.
It can be problematic that it has to be done so far in advance. If one actor is running old code without this rule that actor can be double-spent against. Not only must everyone have upgraded, all implementations of Bitcoins must be kept compatible so btcd and libbitcoin must also be onboard with the change. This is other people's money we're playing with.
Depending on the nature of the change, we probably can't count on their deployment being completely flawless. So we probably want some replay protection too. In case of a chain split we want to minimize and contain the damage as much as possible.
Then there's also concern what "largerlimit" is. It should preferrably not be any random limit, because that would be harder to achieve consensus around. As you can see in the scaling debate there have been no shortage of opinions and not much facts. We would need hard data on how the network behaves with largerlimit in place, with regards to mempool scaling, network latency, and block validation time. The latter affects orphan rates and the last thing we want to do is give miners more incentive to skip validating the transactions.
In the specific case of larger blocks, someone had the bright idea of allowing larger witnesses in segregated witness. This way there could be a slow rolling upgrade the same way p2sh was introduced and everyone would not have to upgrade at the same time. Most involved favored that approach since the p2sh transition was pretty smooth. In that case it wasn't that the fixed block height approach was flawed but that segwit was easier. But there's a whole list (literally, check the wiki) of backwards incompatible changes people want to introduce so sooner or later that too will happen.

I never understood this statement. Only the venture capital invested in Bitcoin companies is well in the billions of dollars over time. Then there are lots of private investments on top of that.
What would give you the idea that miners have invested more than that? I'm not saying it's impossible, but one should be skeptical when someone presents something extraordinary as casual. I don't think it's too much to ask for someone to back up that statements with facts. Especially since I've seen it repeatedly being made.
Then if we count the end users of Bitcoin, the ones who hold and use Bitcoin, they are likely to be even more invested than that. Big institutional investors alone are in the hundreds of million. Yesterday a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin changed ownership through the order books. Which mining investment is even remotely close to that? So of the three types of Bitcoin investments (in mining, in services and in buying it) miners looks like the least invested party to me.
What's more relevant to understand interest in protocol development however is on what timeframe those investments are made. The same pattern repeats itself: Long time holders invest with a ten year timeframe in mind, venture capital is a few years at most. And most mining investments need to break even in a time scale of months to be useful.

The beauty of the completely unregulated cryptocurrency economy is that economic actors on an open market decides which coin is the most valuable. If you think you will do a better job than the current dev team, there's no excuse. Prove it, and you will strike it rich if you get it right.

Sorry, I was unclear. I had the thought that maybe it was a bit much with the logo, the bitcoin text, and the shuttle. The shuttle is the main motif so clearly that stays. But the bitcoin text is a bit redundant, and perhaps the logo could be a bit more subtle. It could be formed by clearing the smoke?
(Or the other way around; only the shuttle and the mysterious "going to the moon since ...")

If everybody starts running bitmaincoind instead of bitcoind, then of course that amounts to centralization. Rules for the coin would be set unilaterally by Bitmain, not by peer review among developers of different affiliations. Bitmain could decide on eternal inflation, or censor transactions, or whatever they like.

But that makes even less sense. If Craig was part of the Nakamoto group, wouldn't he have a stash of Bitcoin? Why would he make a living from shell corporations and tax fraud then? The leaked/planted documents suggests he voluntarily gave placed his private keys in a trust controlled by Kleiman until 2020. That seems like an exceptional risk to take for no good reason whatsoever.
If Craig was only the figurehead of a Nakamoto group financed by some secret cabal, which seems more like a boy fantasy than anything else but crazier things have happened in Bitcoin so let's entertain the thought, that could explain how such a shady person could be involved. But what would he have contributed? If other people did the design and the coding what use did they have of him? And the private keys would certainly not have been his to give away. This argument gets dangerously close to "it makes no sense whatsoever so it's the perfect coverup", by which even more outlandish theories must be considered.
Both these ideas also fail to explain why he went dark for several years and then came back with a PR agency to claim to be Satoshi. Why the change of heart? Then there was all this falsified evidence planted. Did he change his mind again? And why would anyone in the Satoshi group come back several years later to start a company filing _patents_? Surely those should have been filed earlier as to not run into prior use in his own pesudonymous prior work?
I don't see how you could construct a theory that puts Craig in any role of a Nakamoto group which is even remotely plausible.

Interesting. How did you try that? In a simulated environment or on a real network? What kind of latencies are you simulating/seeing?
What did you have to do to your bitcoind to get it to process blocks that size? How large is your mempool? Did it work without any form of parallel validation? Was the recent scaling improvements in bitcoind enough, or did you have to improve further on it?
What's a typical block verification time? What would worst case verification time be? How would that affect block latency? How would that, in turn, affect orphan rates? What is the equilibrium rate for mining empty blocks under those conditions?

I'm not sure what you mean by trust here. Bitcoin by design has no trusted party in the protocol, but perhaps that's not what you mean.
I tried to describe how open source development works. There is no central authority to push through unwanted changes.

That's a dishonest article. Nowhere is it said that there is PoS is not proven in theory yet. Even the lead developer estimates more than a year to implementation, and that can be regarded as a best case if the ideas turns out to have merit.
Sharding nobody believes in. Maybe Vitalik, but his job is to believe in everything from DAOs to ICOs. You split your coin into multiple independent chains. Then what? Since you don't want to tell people they can only pay someone on their own chain you need inter-chain transactions. Aaaaand, there's your scaling problem again.
There are hard problems, like building a crypocurrency from scratch. Or retrofitting things like malleability fixes or fungible transactions. Then there are hard problems like cracking Bitcoin private keys or building quantum computers. Calling the latter a "real challenge" is underselling it.

No, wait, stop. I don't know what "equating" means here, but the rest of your comment doesn't make sense. Of course the size of blocks changes with segwit. Segwit allows for 4MB blocks. Previously we had a hard cap of 1MB.
Segwit does this by doing away with the fixed maximum, and instead use a flexible maximum that depends on the type of transactions used. There are reasons for this. Preliminary calculations suggests that if this was in use today we'd see 1.7MB blocks.
I don't understand what the hashing changes you mention is supposed to be, but the new type of transactions takes up more space than the old. This is part of the reason why segwit blocks were made to be larger. I think you are confusing segwit with other proposals, such as Schnorr, which indeed has the potential to make multisig much smaller.

There was no intention to ever honor that agreement. He broke it within days.
Realize that Jihan doesn't care about blocksize. If he did, he would have supported the early work along those lines. At that time, most Chinese miners were reluctant to lose their transaction fees. This is one of the reasons the agreement happened in the first place. But he found a rift among developers and decided to take advantage of that.
The more fractured the community the better. He openly declares support for something, then works to undermine it. It's the oldest trick in the book. The purpose is to gain influence in Bitcoin. There is also the short term goal of stalling segwit as long as possible, as it makes the Chinese asicboost patent more valuable.


This is provably false. In the blog post where he introduced Bitmaincoin to the world, one of the first things mentioned there is how segwit should be removed. The abolishment of segwit is literally on top of his hard fork wishlist.

Segwt allows for a maximum blocksize of 4 MB. How large an actual block ends up depends on the miner just as before, but also on the types of transactions used. The 1.7 MB figure is based on the transactions we see today.

I don't think the join date is very relevant (except for earnings if you sell), but more what Bitcoin represented at the time.
If Roger Ver is an early adopter then everyone now is also an early adopter. Roger came onboard when Bitcoin already had value, and that value started to skyrocket. Which is pretty much just like now, just with a smaller ecosystem. People who were interested in the potential of Bitcoin came before.


Yeah, but it wasn't really that clear cut, was it? Everyone who contributed was (and still is!) a developer in some sense. It's not something you can be "assigned" by anyone.
The reason Gavin got a lead role had more to do with the downfall of sourceforge, where Satoshi had initially set up the project, which caused everyone to migrate to the repo Gavin had set up on github instead. (That said, I think Gavin did a great job of keeping everyone on the same page for a couple of years before he sort of drifted away from it.)

No, you misunderstand. Open source is not a democracy. Developers don't vote on proposals. Sybil attacks are not applicable.
It is like saying that the scientific process is vulnerable to peer review, as if all mathematicians said pi equals four would somehow make it true. Proposals are vetted and there is peer review. Consensus follows.
There is no person who decides what has consensus and not. That would be the antithesis of consensus. There are some projects that are organized around a BFDL, but Bitcoin is not one of them. This is what we mean when we say "Bazaar-style" or "decentralized project".

Comparably few transactions on both Bitcoin and Ethereum are direct user to user payments.
Bitcoin has strange transaction storms sometimes that we only sometimes know the source of. Applications for document timestamping has been pointed out, as well as tumblers that produce large rings of chained transactions.
Ethereum of course has these huge token sales that creates huge backlogs that makes people pay thousands of dollars in transaction fees.
(This is something that complicates capacity estimates, as several of these applications unfortunately tend to be less price sensitive than direct user payments are.)
I don't think anyone knows for certain why the backlog is being cleared right now. There has been a pattern for quite some time that more transactions are created during the weeks without any clear explanation. It's an inherent problem of peer to peer anonymous systems that we don't know what the users are doing and why. But it's not very likely that less people buy their weed over the weekend.

Yeah, I remember that too as a little bit strange. It seemed a little out of character at the time. It was nice of him to pass the torch when he felt ready for an advisory role, but then came all the drama. Looking back,I think releasing incompatible forks was a turning point which brought much that is hard to recover from.
Then not even a year later Wright came which took strangeness to a whole new level. I didn't understand anything, and still don't. Daytime soap operas have nothing on Bitcoin.
My secret wish is that the more mellow developers of old would return for a while. A little too much of the development community right now is active on Reddit and Twitter flaming trolls. That's not very constructive and creates an atmosphere for new people coming in that there are somehow two sides that you can support, which isn't at all true really. A healthy community needs a steady flow of new developers and I think some damage is already done.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:23:48


I just don't see it really that simplistic. Most people have a bias for their own problem space, but discussion is normally kept technical and at least on surface most people seems to take other's opinions into account. Yes, there are exceptions. Yes, not everything is perfect.
But I just can't bring myself to see that huge conspiracy. It seems like a forced perspective. Sure, if you are absolutely convinced the developers secretly want to bring down bitcoin, I'm sure you can find things to support that perspective. But why would you? If you feel the development is lacking some crucial insight, why not help out and be constructive instead of spinning conspiracy theories by the sidelines?


Why would you say that? And how would you square that with the publicly available facts?
Given that there are, depending on how you would count, somewhere between dozens and hundreds of developers who touch base with the Bitcoin project from time to time, _any_ general statement about these people is likely not to be true.
And specifically, given that we have a soft fork that is proposed, implemented, tested and ready to be deployed that worst case (or best case, depending on your point of view) gives us four times larger blocks than today, and that this is the outcome of years of discussion and peer review to find a solution almost everyone deems good enough, how could you possibly think core developers are secretly against this?
It makes no sense. You might say you disagree with the syntax of transactions, or you disagree with the deployment schedule (who doesn't, nowadays?), or you disagree with script versioning or with the weighting, or you might even disagree with the flexible block size and would prefer to keep it fixed. Sure. Let your voice be heard. But going from there to "no core dev wants bigger blocks", that's just calling light dark.
Why would so many people have invested so much time in something they didn't believe in?


Are you talking about Gavin? Did you actually follow the list at that time? Because that was very far from what happened. He had already transitioned into a "chief scientist" role. While it is true that his ideas about maxblocksize didn't receive much community support in the end, most seemed to take the idea seriously and there was much debate. None of the hard fork ideas has thus far had anyone care deeply enough about them to see them through. I think, perhaps sadly, that the situation wasn't dire enough until last year.
But the proposals about increasing maxblocksize when a hard fork gets realized are very much alive. There are much more realistic proposals of how to manage said hard fork now. In fact, they were brought forward by the very same developers you somehow think are against bigger blocks. Which again wouldn't make much sense if it was true. The advent of things like Lightning have made a lot of people take the idea much more seriously.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:54:48


No, wait, what? That's not how any of this works. Only because one hard fork is fine, doesn't mean they're all safe.
To make a hard fork safe, write a detailed specification. Get it reviewed on the mailing list. Then take this review into consideration, improve the proposal. Repeat as necessary. Discuss activation details with all involved parties. Make sure this includes adversarial thinking. Implement, deploy and activate on the testnet. Repeat as necessary.
That's the basic outline of how development is done. In the open. With review. Not by popular opinion, and not by an idea what's generally safe. We've had a hard fork before, and it wasn't pretty. Let's plan the next one better.

There was never any talk about voting in the early days. If it were, we probably would have had an opcode for that.
The quote is out of context. It was written without making the distinction between nodes that mines and nodes that don't. The fact that non-mining nodes enforce validation too was not relevant at the time. The use of the word voting implies no formal process but simply the consensus process where a minority chain would be orphaned.
Nobody have taken this to mean a formal vote. Improvements to Bitcoin are subject to a fairly standard community consensus.
If you want to quote mine the whitepaper, argue instead that ASIC mining is against the Bitcoin "vision" as expressed by Satoshi himself. But please don't do that, because that would be an exercise in futility and completely irrelevant for today.
And yes, mining is a vested interest in today's Bitcoin. All big mining operations wouldn't hesitate for argue for a delay in block halvenings for example. They are completely arbitrary to the protocol, and in this speculative market the potential increase in supply wouldn't affect the price noticably, as evidenced by dozens of altcoins with a potentially infinite cap.
I'm not much for conspiracy theories but at the same time I do not believe it is a coincidence that the current push to oust developers from the project was sharply intensified at the time of the halvening last year. It actualized the question and played right into some independently developing drama.

No, this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of open source projects.
In "Bazaar-style" projects, consisting of multiple independent organizations, someone with commit access to a repository is a _maintainer_. He/she isn't necessarily a developer, but a developer who has shown aptitude for maintainership is the most common type.
_Developers_ usually has no commit access to the repository. They send their contributions to the relevant mailing list, or tool for the purpose which in github's case is a pull request. After passing peer review, any of the maintainers (see above) will then merge this change into the official repository.
There is also often yet another role, the release manager, who is a maintainer with special privileges to build binary releases. This is then in the case of Bitcoin double checked against other builds to make sure there are no discrepancies.
If a maintainer would block a change for political or ecoistical reasons (this happens), or if a maintainer would commit his/her own code without review and consensus about the change (this would be even worse), then said maintainer would find him/herself stripped of privileges in a heartbeat. If maintainers tried to coup the project by cooperating with bad behaviour, developers would quickly appoint new managers.
Any sufficiently large open source project is set to work this way. See Linux for example. Maintainers do not decide what to merge. The result of peer review does. If your change was not accepted by the community you can not blame the maintainers for not merging it.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:22:09
That's false flagging then. The BIP9 flags are absolutely _useless_ if miners override them without actually being ready. A set flag means we have the feature fully functional and ready for lock-in.
"Ready to change software" doesn't really count. In that meaning 100% of the network is ready for segwit, because everyone could just "flip a switch" and enable it. But it is said switch that must trigger the bit, otherwise we could lock-in too early and not have the security we think we have.
BIP9 clearly was a bad idea. I don't know how many times it has to be demonstrated in practice before we can let it go. The old block height soft forks ("UASF", if you will) had their problems but BIP9 is even worse. If miners stand by ready to flip a switch when something is about to activate we clearly do not need this signalling nonsense.

There are many ways to get replay protection. Premined hardforks is not really the way you'd go about that. It just wouldn't make sense. If segwit2x fails to gain support, ripping out segwit from it will not help.
There is plenty time to make changes to segwit2x if uasf should turn out with economic consensus for some reason. The most obvious perhaps being making it compatible and then we could end up with one chain instead of three. Chainsplits can not be countered with more chainsplits.

Sure, but creating transactions isn't the problem here. If activation is vastly different between test and main, then that is not a test of activation. The presence of bounty transactions and whatnot might be relevant. They may be gameable. I don't know. There may be a cat-and-mouse game of orphaning the first block. I don't know. Just activating the fork without transaction pressure isn't very realistic.
The point of testing is to find out what you don't know. Everything I can think of I can test. But then I need exploratory testing to find the ones I didn't think of.
I suspect you need realistic economic conditions. Those doesn't exist for testnet, and that's a problem. But there could be an effort to simulate at least a couple of realistic ones. There's no need to sink into a flamefest (although I suspect that may be too late for some), but it also doesn't inspire confidence in the efforts behind testing this before it goes live.

Have you seen this, or is this your idea of what you think happens on the list?
Of course some people will be more listened to than others. But anyone can turn out from nowhere with a valid argument and be heard out. In fact the signal to noise ratio is not very high. This is especially true for Bitcoin where developers often turn up under pseudonyms. One of the nobodies is likely Satoshi is disguise.


This is a fundamental misunderstanding how open source development works. I wrote about this the other day since by coincidence you seem to have the exact same misunderstanding as another Reddit user.
A _developer_ is someone who writes code and submits this for peer review.
A _maintainer_ is a non-development role that merges code where there is consensus that the change is well implemented and possible to test. The maintainer role is a rather janitorial one, not much fame for a lot of work. It is ususally given out to anyone who shows themselves competent for the job and with enough time on their hands. A maintainer will not sneakily commit their own code if they wish to retain said privileges.
A lead maintainer, or more commonly known as the _release_ _manager_ is the one responsible for rolling the new release and publishing it when there is rough consensus that the are enough changes made to warrant a new release. In Bitcoin this work is then double checked to make sure there are no discrepancies.

Did we read the same document?
It opens by declaring support for the NY agreement and then went on to declare all the ways they would break it. Come August, which means long before we know if the NY agreement has "failed" or not (whatever that would even mean?), they will start mining a new Bitcoin-like chain but without segwit with and a first block above one megabyte in size.
This chain will not be accepted by legacy cilents, not by btc1 ("segwit2x") clients, not by UASF clients. Not by btcd clients, not by bcoin clients, not by libbitcoin. Only by bitmaincoin clients.
Oh, by the way, this software is not released yet. But worry not, there are no less than three(!) teams working on it. It will be available to you on the first of July and you will want to run it because it will be awesome.
They promise to mine this chain in private for 72 hours, so the first 432 blocks on this chain will be guaranteed to have been mined by Bitmain. That would net them a nice profit of 5400 extra bitmaincoin. They then proceed to declare a "non-exhaustive" list of reasons they might decide not to release this chain, which would supposedly leave their bitmaincoin clients with the legacy chain.
(So when you never see this chain, it is not because they never intended to waste money mining it. Of course not. It is because they decided not to publish it. For the good of the network. Bitmain cares about you.)
How anyone can possibly understand this chain of actions to be in any way supportive of the New York agreement is completely beyond me. The agreement even has "segwit" in its name, the very thing Bitmain promises to remove first. I would love to say "I told you so"; but I doubt anyone who followed the recent year's events actually believed that Bitmain would enable segwit just because Silbert told them they should.

No, it's not my "opinion" that nobody thinks segwit is enough. It's that exactly zero people have had that opnion in public, while every developer who has had an opinion on it says it's not.
I don't know why you want to talk about activation schemes suddenly. That there's no one who thinks segwit is the endgame of Bitcoin scaling efforts is a fact, and it has nothing to do with activation schemes.
Your opinion on the matter however is misinformed. Setting a flag day would not have been "more reasonable" for the very reasons put forward at the time it was suggested. For one, it doesn't offer any replay protection. We also have no means of forcing upgrades, which is problematic. There's little reason to believe it can be activated faster than the soft forks you mention.

It might also be important to point out _why_ that message was embedded in the genesis block. Apart from being a good soundbite it was put there for a reason.
It acts as a timestamp that guarantees that block could not have been manufactured in advanced. It acts as a guarantee that Bitcoin was not pre-mined. There was no central authority that could have done an "ICO". Satoshi had to mine on the terms as everyone else.

There are no "sides". Can we please have an informed discussion where we don't have to pretend that this is a debate about the block size?

I don't know. Roger's bitcointalk account was registered april 2011, if that's anything to go by. But if he can pull seniority on the audience, I think that says more of the audience than of him. He did famously invest in a number of Bitcoin companies. Does that make him an expert on Bitcoin or Bitcoin companies? Not really. I _did_ like that billboard, however.
Gavin picked up lead as Satoshi left (and Wladimir picked up when Gavin tired), that much is clear. I have no idea if there was a formal assignment. But that Mike and Gavin was somehow alone is silly. Did he actually claim they were? You can just look at the commit logs. Jeff and a handful others were a lot more active than Mike ever was. But I think one should be careful claiming they contributed more or earlier than another. That is mostly of historical interest.

That distinction is a strange one that doesn't really have any basis in physical reality.
Segwit blocks are more bytes, stored as well as in transit. It is as "raw" as it gets. If they really wanted bigger blocks they would have just turned it on.
It would be beneficial for everyone if we could just drop this charade of "big vs. small blocks", as that has never been the point of contention.

Yes, it does indeed have a misleading title. If you take the time to read what is promised in it, it is to start mining bitmaincoins _if uasf activates_. They even give a specific point in time. That point is before segwit2x has activated, and given that time travel is impossible what you say can not be true.
And the whole point of uasf is unilateral activation, so we know it will activate at some scale. Bitmain will then consider to release their premined chain. I have my doubts. I have never seen a more empty threat in my life. This purpose of this document is confusion (I believe the modern term is FUD), just as the HK and NY agreements and the steady stream of strange Tweets.
As a "contingency plan" to segwit2x at some later time the strategy would make absolutely no sense at all. They could just activate segwit2x instead and be done with it.

That's the point, isn't it? Since no exchanges except GDAX are aboard with the NYA, those buys will not be what the average people will buy.
Not even the miners are going to be able to dump the coins. Silbert claims majority support, but that's part of a big game of chicken. If that 80% consist mostly of one man shows and small local companies it sure isn't that clear cut it's made out to be.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:45:50


Even at &gt;50%, miners have more to gain from mining fairly than from any sort of attack (modulo Eyal/Sirer selfish mining, asicboost and other attacks that skews the odds), so there is an economic incentive to play fair.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:15:54
No, wait, stop. 80% of exchanges are not with the Silbert agreement. None of the big exchanges are. Unless you count the big payment processor as a sort of meta-exchange. (Note: The zero figure is wrong, see below for correction.)

Did you undertake this work two years ago? You can't really demand that people work on what interests you, for free. That's not how open source works.
That said, core developers did start to work on hard fork deployment scenarios much longer than two years ago. That's roughly when we got the first seriously intended proposals. And you have to include Andresen and Hearn among core developers, because they were at the time.
Nobody really followed through on that at time though, maybe because the cost of transactions weren't really an immediate concern at the time. Miners didn't look very favorably on having to work more for less reward. In retrospect, getting the new validation code in shape was probably more important to get Bitcoin to scale.
Fast forward two years and the transaction capacity is a real problem to people. And, not surprisingly, there is now a whole lot more done, notably from Lau, Todd, and others. So "stonewalling" is not just misleading, it's plain wrong. I am certain we will get there, as soon as we are done with the drama where miners back one proposal after the other on no technical grounds because they view it as a power struggle. It's not, it's the birth of a new system, complete with drama and infighting. The only thing we know about the future is that it's not going to look like today.

Was it just me, or did Wang's twitter flow at the time hint indirectly at shorting? Inbetween the seemingly bipolar tweets were nuggets that hinted at watching the price.
I think it made me understand Jihan's seemingly irrational behaviour too. If the aim actually is to confuse and stall, he's actually quite rational. And confusion can sometimes be an effective method to strengthen a weak negotiation position. In this case, it could also be traded on for profit along the way.
It made me feel a little better, in a strange way. A little more optimistic for segwit too.

What I think the person you replied to missed what that the two guys in your example doesn't necessarily need to use the same "hub" (this wording can be misleading). The network can, with information about every open channel everywhere, find a way to settle two parties with any number of intermediaries.
The interesting question to ask is how this could possibly work without a centralized party that keeps double spending and other cheating out. Basically the same problem that Bitcoin set out to solve. And Lightning's way to do it is based on time locked contracts, and using cryptographic proofs to identify cheaters, take their money, and kick them out. That's sort of the ten second pitch. It comes with a lot of if's and but's that you can read more about in the white paper.

Everyone wants bigger blocks. What you wrote about was a block size increase that is not segwit. The only people who argues for that are those who benefit from stalling an increase. And they don't argue from a technical perspective. If you really believe the mainstream is an echo chamber, it might be good to consider a wider range of possibilities.


Perhaps you should attend the development community for a while, instead of making up crazy theories about those evil open source people. I'm sure those meetups you go to will be more rewarding with a little more background knowledge.

Did not the google search work for you? I hate it when personalization screws that up.
Anyway, this was the link I got:
Here's the direct quote cut and pasted for you: Buterin was recently appointed as an advisor to the board of Primalbase , a startup that is aiming to tokenize a WeWork or Regus-type co-working space provider and grant micro-ownership to its investors. "I'm definitely very interested in all these applications, particularly the semi-financial ones with some components of finance and monetary value but also some components outside of it" said Buterin.
It's not like he doesn't know what the reporter asks about. And it's not hard to find other examples him talking up ICOs. And it's not different from the DAO which several core Ethereum people with a stake in it pumped hard at the time. I'm sure Vitalik isn't leaving this advisory board role empty-handed. Always great to raise money, or how was that?
@_date: 2016-07-29 09:38:50
Even if you buy a Trezor, you still need some wallet software. Electrum has support for Trezor. In that case all this is done when initializing the device and you will get your seed from there.
By default Electrum uses many private keys. All these are generated from a seed, which you should type down on paper and store securely. If/when your computer crashes you enter this seed to restore the wallet. You can also choose to run Electrum with just one private key, in which case this is the one you should backup.
Be sure to _also_ take backups. The seed should be your secondary backup in case your primary backup fails, and therefore not stored in the same building as your primary (in case of fire or flooding).
For mobile, Mycelium is what people usually recommend for Android (which works with Trezor if you get a special cable) and Breadwallet for iOS.

I have never paid a $2000 transaction fee. The only people who have done that with Bitcoin is the result of a fat fingered mistake.
If you're shilling for Ethereum, why not stick to things that could at least be realistic? It's a bit silly to claim higher higher transaction rates when we all saw the trainwreck two weeks ago. We clearly saw the capacity limit _in_ _practice_ and it wasn't pretty.

When the latest ICO hit earlier this week transactions were backlogged for more than a day. People paid $2000 in transaction fees just to get in front.
You don't have to be a genius, just look at the protocol, you'd expect Ethereum to scale similarly to Bitcoin, but with a little less capacity as the transactions tend to be larger.

But we were told, in no uncertain terms by a Ethereum Foundation employee, that Vitalik does not know who these people are and that they are going after these scammers.

Quadruple sized blocks is hardly "marginal", by any stretch of the word.
It _is_ however not enough for the forseeable future. Nobody argues it is. But it would be outright ridicolous to make insanely large blocks in one go. We _have_ to do it stepwise. And nobody has so far argued we shouldn't, so it is not very useful to insinuate the opposite.


That's unfair, and you probably know it. We need versioned scripts (a personal interest of mine), we need malleability immunity, we need to reduce uxto fragmentation. Bitcoin must be upgraded with new features, just like it has always been, as long as those features have a rough consensus in the community, is thoroughly tested, and has met proper peer review.
If you don't personally want to use segwit for ideological reasons, then fine. Don't. But the fact that others will, will free up space for your old style transactions. You won't be able to use new features that some smart contracts require, but it will be perfectly useful to you. Backwards compatibility. It's a great idea.


I've hung around the mailing list long enough to know a few things. One is that technical arguments carry a lot of weight.
What you are really asking are what objections there are against a hard fork. The important background here is that we can't get everyone to upgrade at the same time. That is not an argument against anything, but it is a fact that you have to relate to when _making_ your arguments. We also have economic activity in Bitcoin. People actually pay their bills with it, and we have to protect against double spending.
This leads to a number of important characteristics to forced network upgrades. One is that replay protection becomes very important. Another is that hard forks preferrably should be planned well in advance. These things are under active discussion, and we have proposals such as spoonnet which, while complicated, delivers of many of these requirements.
What I remember from the various hard fork proposals brought forth on the mailing list is first and foremost that nobody has cared enough about their proposals deeply enough to see it through the proposal stage. But also that the most promising proposals, including the above by Lau, has been worked on by the very same developers you accuse of bullshit.
It borders on the ridicolous to accuse the very same developers of having some secret agenda against bigger blocks: Why then would they spend so much time and energy to work on that? And please don't bring up some anecdote about one single developer who said something once. Speak instead of the dozens of developers who are constantly active in this space. When you speak of core developers you have to realize that you are including several hundred people in that term.


Indeed. Why do we not have segwit activated? One suggestion is asicboost. Nobody knows for sure. But from lurking the relevant lists, I am reasonably sure that we will increase block size, both by segwit and other means.

That's a strange claim considering it's a straight up copy of Bitcoin with PoW switched out and a couple of parameters changed.
All altcoins that follow that pattern (of which there are many) will scale exactly like Bitcoin. They can differ at most by a constant factor. (That factor may be big or small but it can not be big enough to make for an order of magnitude difference.)
Altcoins have a place within the ecosystem, just like sidechains do. They can take load off the main chain. But don't pretend they have made some theoretical breakthrough, because we haven't seen that. Yet.

What if everyone shuts down their Bitcoin node _simultaneously_? It's a fundamental problem with the Bitcoin peer network that no one has written a four hundred word article about yet. Connect that scenario with segwit and you too can earn a little pocket money from nChain to get it published.
Yes, witness data can be optionally pruned. This doesn't mean everyone will do it. Just as everyone isn't running a pruned node today. You don't have to bring up contract law to realize it would be bad for the network if no one could validate the entire blockchain anymore.

Very few developers that paid to work on Bitcoin. You should ask them. It's one of the ironies of Bitcoin, that despite billions of dollars in VC capital, despite hundreds of millions being spent on specialized ASIC equipment, only an immeasurably small trickle funds the development of the open source project behind it all. Which brings me to:


The Bitcoin variant of tragedy of the commons. If you personally work on improving Bitcoin does absolutely nothing to further the value of your coins (what you call investment). One person is not enough to tackle the large projects involved, and to be frank very few people has the skills required to do so. Meanwhile, there are people working on this for technical and/or political reasons. So the rational thing to do is to buy and hold, which amounts to profiting off other people's work.
And if you wish to help the project anyway (maybe your "investment" is so large that any tiny bit matters, or you have a soft spot in your heart for the project), in terms of expected profit there is a much larger payoff from social rather than technical efforts, i.e. buy billboards to get more people in the system. This is because the speculative upside is orders of magnitude greater than the operative one.
All this said not to prove a point but to provide a bit of background to why we, necessarily, ended up where we are.


It does not matter how much you have invested to have a say. As ideas meet peer review, only what you say matters.
If you have a personal interest in where investment happens, do note that the VC money of the services ecosystem around Bitcoin dwarfs the mining investment by an order of magnitude. And they are both eclipsed by the end users buying and holding Bitcoin. The 5M USD/day mining subsidy is a drop in the bucket on the daily order books.


Bitcoin is a project, not a company.
There is no fence, not even metaphorical. A developer is someone with code in, or corresponding knowledge of, the project. There is no central authority to decide who is current and who is not.
This goes for the present state too. Make your voice heard, and make a reasonable argument, and you are a contributor. You do not register anywhere and you do not have to agree with the direction of the project to be a developer. Indeed, there are many contributions under pseudonym.

Succeed with what? What is your interest in cryptocurrency?
If you are technically inclined, take up a project. Depending on how comfortable you are with Bitcoin internals, either something Bitcoin related (sidechains? mimblewimble?) or something where you use it as a backend.
If you want to start a business, start small. See if you like it. Be open to new ideas what you can improve or do differently. You don't have to be a subject expert if you can people who are.
If you want to make quick money on other people's work (nothing wrong with that, everybody can't work with Bitcoin), get a job and stuff pocket money into btc each month. Don't think about it daily, just save up a little for whatever future comes.
It might feel like everything is happening _right_ _now_. But it really isn't. Bitcoin is already eight years old, and _if_ Bitcoin gets big for important use cases it'll take another ten years to get there. Those years will be both ups and downs and dead ends. Don't worry too much about it. The only way to keep doing something is to find what's fun about it and stick to that.
