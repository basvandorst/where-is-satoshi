Facts are hard.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:21:14
NYTimes is still fake news, I see.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:58:01
Agreed. And I would like to see a similar ending in Ver's case. Being a gratuitous dick isn't a crime, but it can invite the attention of folks who would start looking for your crimes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:25:41
I searched for hours weeks ago to find an exact date that Coinbase/GDAX set in stone. I found no such date. Can you link me to where they said Jan 1st?
Also, why does it matter? Exchanges add and remove coins all the time spontaneously and no one panics.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:19:57
If you say so.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:12:05
I tried replacing wallet.dat in Program Files. The app won't launch once I do.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:34:03
M-hmm, considering I can undo the damage in 5 seconds on other subs, what does it matter? I enjoy bursting bubbles. 
I have more faith in BTC than any other, but you people are super desperate for a savior to its technical limitations that you'll prop up the most minuscule solutions. This news is a fucking snot-rag in place of a cure for a terminal cancer. Something has to evolve or this won't end pretty. Stop avoiding the issue. Turn down the memes, and get to promoting solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:27:22
Link? And even still, how is that a crime? BCH was online for a few minutes and people bought like mad, yes? So what's the problem if the value spiked? It's natural.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:49:02
The maturity of this sub has sunk to a new low. Don't get me wrong, both subs act like babies, but today you guys are setting records.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:40:56
Segwit is already functioning with many wallets right? Has nothing to do with coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:05:40
5 year olds and google dont mix lately, if headlines are any indication.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:37:59
No, that clearly states they intended to allow WITHDRAWAL of BCH. Not trading. Speculate all you want, but competition is good. If you only have faith in BTC because it was the first, then you're doing this all wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:29:15
Actually it was a legit question. If I send an amount from electrum, I was led to believe it already has segwit. If this is false, then this cult lied once again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:59
Some sanity, finally.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:11:53
Bitcoin and BTC subs are both garbage at this point. Theyre both mocked daily by other crypto subs. So much so that I am thinking of digging out my paper wallets and investing entirely into alt coins. Both cults are just pathetic at this point,. At least I know 95% of Bitcoin HODLers have nothing to do with this dumbass sub.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:29:12
It really doesn't sound like it's my problem...exchanges should just require a withdrawal to a private wallet to be greater than the current fee.
Edit: adorable. You guys should tell me to recycle my soda cans while you're at it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:31:56
That's the spirit!
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:16:05
I don't know either, frankly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:14:52
Obvious inside deal = They told you like 5 months ago this was coming.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:19:10
Dear God the salt, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:55:43
But it still required 160gb of space which I didn't have. It wouldn't let me even setup anything. Maybe I'll dig out an external HDD...
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:50:09
Bent? Sounds like a shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:28:33
Then you are misinformed. I dont see any charts showing BCH reaching anywhere near that value around 6pm central time, or ever.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:01:24
I know. I'm just fantasizing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:39:22
Once again, I don't see the problem. If it spiked that hard, that fast, oh well. Good for him. I don't know what your accusation is.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:24:44
Understood. Still doesn't effect me. Me being the person you guys created with your HODL mantra. If I HODL, I never need to care about any of this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:22:44
I assume that you are referring to how it's clearly busted and disabled right now. No one is doing any BCH action at the 9k range. Its inaccurate until it's up and running again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:00
How do I not support BTC when I hold a good portion of it longterm on paper? But thanks for proving my case.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:59:40
I'm pretty sure he can afford to pull a fast one on us. I mean, do you need a weiner? I know a guy. I can get you a weiner by 3pm, but it'll cost ya.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:03:55
Weird how when I mentioned this, all the hippies here yelled at me about how I was exploiting poor GDAX, making them foot the bill, and how I should be willing to pay such fees. GDAX made quite a lot off my stupid panic trades before I decided to HODL, so I think they'll survive.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:10:11
So youre saying I'm somehow in debt to GDAX? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:46:27
You conspiracy dipshits call every thing in crypto outside of BTC suspicious on here. Could you take your crybaby bullshit elsewhere and stop buzzing my inbox?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:35:11
Made a wallet in May of 2013 and forgot to look for an exchange. Still got the wallet but it's a wallet.dat file and apparently I need to run a full node to even open the thing to make sure it's empty.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:18:48
How do I even open the wallet.dat with Bitcoin Core? I see no way to.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:27:08
If the bar is giving zero fucks about an exchange's profits, give me my ribbon already.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:07:17
The update to the tech was already done. This is just the exchange finally getting on board to save themselves more money.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:49:39
Eli5 how this effects us?
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:23:39
I'm down like 45% and not a care in the world, kiddos. Just zoom out. And if you really fear the situation, just research your chosen investments. If they can provide a service to the world, relax, if they can't, move your investment. If your brain can't process this task, leave until your banking institution reinjects you into one of these without even letting you know.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:01:19
Ok but don't they pay all the fees? I just did a test $2 transfer to a paper wallet and was surprised that the fee was higher than that, but they cover it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:20:37
I hate him for his personality, but I'm glad to see you state the facts. Especially on this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:17:33
I just signed up but if you don't have a bank they recognise in their list, you still must wait for an initial bank wire to succeed before you are eligible for instant deposits in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:34:58
Thank you. I suppose I should have also asked if I moved my BTC offline right now, I would have no way to extract that BCH. I assume that's the case. It's a bit over my head, which is why I said this is a stupid question.
For the record, I just watched Roger ver on Rubin squirm hilariously when asked why his coin wasn't on top right now. He gave a pathetic excuse that screamed of "things just aren't fair".
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:05:49
Are you two for real?
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:15:13
I sure wish there was a way to instantly deposit more USD on gdax. 4 business days from now this dip will be over with.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:01:17
I'm for free alt to immediately sell. Who isn't?
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:55:53
So preachy. And preaching everything I already agree with. Didn't answer the question at all. Bravo. I expected no less.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:30:18
At least spell it "minors".....
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:12:13
Indeed. Poor Rubin was out of his element in that interview. Didn't know when to call bs.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:03:38
Of course. Not what I asked.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:19:34
You post an irrelevant opinion, even if I agree with the opinion, it's a waste of time and bandwidth and it gets down voted.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:37:06
This dude looks like Brainchild.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:24:53
I'd sell on the exchange and then move my BTC offline. Correct? Also I'm not interested in your sub's battle with the other sub. I think both subs are acting like children. I personally don't have faith in BCH. I just wanna sell my chunk if I'm owed it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:09:43
I originally entered at the ATH of 5247, and now I have heavenly dreams of BTC sinking back down to that level so I can buyback in and erase stupid trades from my memory.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:02:01
Hope so. I'm ready to buy back in.
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:10:37
Because it's CURRENT YEAR.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:31:44
Followed him hard since the 90s and 2 years ago I had to quit him. He's completely sold out.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:13:31
That does not answer the question.
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:10:32
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:20:19
I'm not interested in doing that either. I basically am just planting a time capsule here.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:30:34
I guess he meant pogs? No wait. Troll dolls? Shit, no, uh... Furby? None of this computes.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:27:59
Yeah. My only concern here was if that site's offline LiveCD was trustworthy for making perfectly unique seeds. But I'll look into how to make a seed by hand.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:43:26
I swear almost daily I read about Texas doing the right thing and the rest of the country remaining ignorant, on practically every issue of every nature. I really need to move there.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:46:11
I'm afraid of those devices dying after some amount of time or being damaged. And I have no interest in accessing funds or doing anything with them for years.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:17:25
Unless he was just living rent free with parents for two years while working full time. Not really an accomplishment.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:06:27
I guess I'm confused. I thought that paper was the safest offline long term storage method.
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:33:08
Yes....by using the LiveCD they offer, right?
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:15:39
I specifically said I will not be touching the funds for years. So again, I don't need these devices.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:55:51
That's what I don't get. If the device isn't needed to access the funds, what the hell good is it for security?
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:28:34
For entropy's sake right?
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:06:20
For me it was stuck using the front camera and refused to flip to rear when I hit the icon to do so. I ended up completing the process on coinbase via PC image upload.
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:32:45
That's what I thought...
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:08:49
Fake News never fails to impress me.
