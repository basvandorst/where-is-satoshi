They don’t actually have insurance on their USD, the just have custodial accounts with their bank partners. Basically they send all their money to their banking partners like USAA depending on State and other local restrictions in the US and those banks have the normal FDIC insurance.

It’s easy Wells Fargo will do it without you even asking ��

I mean they can the same way Wells Fargo can just take all the money in your checking account. Their shtick is that they are regulated so if they did just steal all your coins it would be a crime. Though it probably is a lot easier for them to steal it than a bank.

Be even more impressed. They saw bitcoin taking off and were an early investor in Coinbase.

You can look it up on the FDIC website
Here's where coinbase expalins how that they use custodial accounts
And how they use their banking partners in section 5.1 of their legal agreement (Used to actually specifically mention this is how the FDIC insurance used to come into play).
What they do is deposit USD in your name at their partner banks. It is not illegal in anyway to claim that the putting money in a FDIC insured bank means it is FDIC insured. They aren't a bank and nowhere do they advertise that they are an FDIC member like you'd see displayed prominently at a BoA. I don't why you think I'm pulling this out of nowhere. This is what they announced when they started it, what news sites reported on, and what people discussed on reedit years ago when it happened.

Isn’t mining designed to be stopped? There is a finite amount of bitcoin that will be created
