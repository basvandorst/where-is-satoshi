You can always start a "2nd Foundation".

The only major problem with it is that the "consensus" is backed by a standing army. [FIXED]

A Lie?

Shrem believes in Bitcion So Much that he resigned from the foundation as soon as he could (when he made bail).   I can't judge Shrem, he may have made some mistakes, however, I do NOT consider the things he was charged with as "crimes".   But he may have made the mistake of running his business as "IF" the USA was a free nation.  So in that context his mistake was failure to recognize the reality that the USA is NOT a free and open economy.
Karpeles running the biggest BTC exchange for a long time made him a top target.   I am sure he had many offers to turn Benedict Arnold, that he turned down.  He is getting squeezed from "both sides" in the BTC vs Fiat war.  I believe he was always trying to do the right thing, but has his share of problems.

Karpeles isn't perfect, however he did expose a problem.
Yes, there are problems with Gox, but other exchanges were affected, so he does get a props from me for sticking his neck out first.
I am disgusted with the lynch mob mentality around here lately.
Edit: spelling
I believe, Karpeles, and  Charlie Shrem, have honorable intentions, even if they make mistakes like the rest of us.

No there is a difference:

but non mining BIP148 nodes need miners mining blocks running a mining node running BIP148 code for it to have meaning.
Or are you claiming that after August 1st the BIP148 nodes will allow me to use segwit code being mined with miners running BIP141 code (currently at about 42%   ?

Always: Coinbase &gt; Wallet where you control private keys &gt; someone else
Never:  Coinbase &gt; someone else
Any questions?

So you don't think attacking fungibility is harming bitcoin?

"The true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.* Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons’ mistakes of judgment" Benjamin Graham

This is what is happening in a nutshell :
Big money backing segwit2x got angry because their segwit2x got pwned on testnet.
Big money backing segwit2x then throw a fit and tried crashing the crypto prices, shaking the trees.
