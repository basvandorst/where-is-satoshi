I think this is the end of bitcoin.

That's an extreme example. Food is necessity to survive. You would give away all your gold if you had it for food if you needed it. I'm thinking more about non-basic needs. No one is buying bread with btc. 


Well, I think most people in the world do wait until things become cheaper. It's just in the west we spend because we have all this money and we know if we wait our value of money will decrease, but mostly because we just have it and know we can get the same amount next month.

White. Racism is OK as long as it's against white people.

I understand all those points, but I don't see the general population favoring internet security over a rise in the value of their bitcoins. The risk vs reward favors the increase in their value of money. 
Do you think it's a problem for the future though? After all bitcoins have been mined and the value soars, people know that the value will only increase as more people adopt it, thus they won't spend, they will save.

I'll keep bitcoin-qt running, let it synchronize. I'll do anything to help out.

Awesome! My first btc purchase!

They have? What is a "reason"? 


My point is why though? Why would you spend money when you know the value is going to rise? Wouldn't you just use dollars instead of bitcoin almost every time?
