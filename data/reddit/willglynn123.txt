What this broad doesn’t bother to mention is that while she is lying by omission because you can send gold through plastic cards, the more large scale reason bitcoin is superior SoV and MoE is because it is the “harder money”. It is peer to peer and unstoppable, gold is neither

@_date: 2018-09-20 10:17:47
Yeah then again he made the claim himself, they weren’t allegations, so the burden of proof is on him. The moment I really knew, is because I know the kind of moves liars like to make, he repeated a quote of satoshi saying “if you don’t understand I don’t have the time to explain it to you” . Completely self aware attempt to plant a symmetry of personality to him and satoshi. I guess we all have our ways of determining the truth, but for me that was a self evident ploy that any intelligent liar would use to manipulate the narrative in an off the cuff “I don’t know what you’re talking about” manner.
The real problem is why claim to be satoshi if 1) you can’t prove it and 2) you try to fake the proof on a global scale. In my opinion it is because of , as Dennis Reynolds would say, the implication. The implication is that there will always be 2 sides anyway and he knows this cloud of “maybe,  maybe not “ mystery of what you point out to be hard to prove a negative, I think he knows that as well, and in weighing out the options he chose cheap dignity rather than righteous dignity which would be to either say you aren’t satoshi or say you can’t prove that you are satoshi. Instead he cleams satoshi And tries to prove, with failure. That’s the perfect cocktail to make just enough people talk about you. Because of the implication. He chose the indefinite narrative much like a politician or neurotic blowhard, which is what I think he is because he already proves he likes the concept of appeal to authority by literally using the titles of his PhD as a rebuttal in arguments; which if we remember, would be the opposite of satishis nature
I liked Vitaliks explanation of why he thinks he’s a fake, he used game theory like the nerd he is which I just thought was so fitting. Anyway I just think it’s funny that this school is clearly ripping on him because your original statement is right
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:01:48

@_date: 2018-09-19 16:20:38
If you have access to a bank account, the most painless experience would be a transfer on the platform Coinbase. If you want a truly secure wallet and don't plan on trading it any time soon, Use [Bitaddress.org]( when you are offline, write the private key down on a piece of paper, preferably twice in two different places. You can add your own second layer of encryption be simply writing down (or taking mental note if you trust your memory) a key code that says all of the 6's and E's in your written key are actually 2's and A's so even if someone finds it they won't have the right key. Then send the Funds on Coinbase to the Public key of that private key and the signature of those bitcoins will now be in your wallet. The public key can be derived from the private key but not visa versa.
If you don't have access to a bank you'll need to find someone who is willing to trade their BTC for cash which requires trust unfortunately

Dude the mods of that sub took it down. Most people still hate bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:49:12
You can obtain bitcoins on Coinbase, but you don’t have to hold them on Coinbase, if you send them to your own private wallet, it’s just like holding gold or cash. It is yours and only yours to control. Nobody can confiscate it. Think of a wallet as a bank which you own and you are fully responsible for the fate of the funds. Coinbase does have an insurance policy on your funds, but they are a 3rd party custodian holding your funds for you which defeats the fundamental purpose of bitcoin; this likely wouldn’t mean anything to those simply trying to make gains off bitcoin. And a bank offering insurance on your life savings means nothing in an actual financial collapse, just ask the Greeks

Well I think there are no lions left in politics to put it really simply. Also I wasn’t arguing for bitcoin education, I’m arguing for Finance as a core highschool curriculum. I know it’s not an easy thing to do but all this injustice in all departments has gone unaffected for decades and a think a true American hero could take on the beast, it has less to do with the presidency itself and more to do with the individuals capability, while leveraging the presidency. Hard yes impossible no
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:28:09
Yes agreed. But I would likely say that you are in the upper echelon of cyber security and cyber awareness , less likely for the frat bro bragging about lambos with the same email and password for everything who opens emails saying "Amazon is giving you a gift!"
of course I am just riffing for fun mate; I give people a hard time when they are overtly dyspraxic with their finances like our friend up there at the top of the thread. especially when they give exact numbers so random redditors can know that they're "drippin in bills"


I wasn't planning on it lol, I know literally nothing about hacking

Just take the public key accompanied with your paper wallet, or the QR code which is the square box with an array of black and white squares , scannable on the Coinbase app when you select the “send” function, and send the funds from Coinbase to that public key address. Public key is for receiving bitcoin, and can be seen by anyone, nobody can access your wallet with your public key, it is merely an address. Private key is what you should never let anyone see and is for sending bitcoin out the the wallet.
1. Add funds to Coinbase
2. Generate a paper wallet and write down the private key, never forget this number or you will lose your funds forever.
3.Also write down the public key, it is not a secret, it can be imagined as an email address essentially, if you lose the public key, you can restore it with your private key
4. On Coinbase select the send icon at the top right corner and send it to the public key address,
Note: all cryptocurrencies have different wallets. You cannot send ethereum to a bitcoin wallet, nothing will happen and you will lose those funds.
Some wallet clients are advanced and can hold multiple wallets of different coins in one place. The easiest and safest way to do this is to buy a hard wallet, which is actual hardware that looks like a usb drive. Even if someone got your private keys with a hard wallet , they can’t access the funds because a physical confirmation on the hard wallet itself with the click of a button is required. Most hardwallets cost just under $90. For now you can survive on paper wallets, but if you become more invested in diverse crypto assets, it is recommended to get a hardwallet. Just always be sure that the coins you are sending to a wallet are compatible with that wallet.
If you have no Technical analysis or fundamental analysis training, I highly suggest against trading until you understand markets very well. 90% of traders in this space get burned; badly. Your best option as a newcomer is to hold coins with sterling reputation in the community (Bitcoin, Litecoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, Dash, Binance coin, dogecoin.
You are in the innovators/ early adopters phase, or the top 10 percentile of adopters. This market is extraordinarily young and while it may seem prices over the years have already skyrocketed, there is plenty of space to go. We all have the complete access of angel investors in the internet of money which will become the norm within 20-25 years. Buying a platform token is like buying railroad tracks, buying bitcoin is like buying gold before people cared about gold. Be patient as this is still a infantile and volatile market

I completely disagree there’s a lot of things the president can do as he appoints the secretary of education, has the biggest voice in the world, and can work with branches to make change. Look at the founding fathers in this video they all shit on and killed the banks initially. You just think a president can’t do this because we haven’t had a decent president in over 100 years,
Bitcoin flourishing will result in people buying shares in bitcoin and fractional reserving bitcoin and the cycle repeats.... bitcoin is not the be all end all. Sending these retards to jail is a better start. I haven’t heard any of the past 3 presidents say “ fuck these people they are criminals” they all love it

I think the current disruption is wherever fintech DAOs and legal implications can take this new technology.

That’s convenient. I define welfare as welfare. “financial support given to people in need” .And social security is still more than military so you’re still wrong. It’s really sad if you’re gonna pretend that’s what you meant and try to walk back your logic. Your 2 arguments were “not a lot of money goes into that “ and “most of your budget covers military” which both were wrong. Now you’re shamelessly trying to get off on a technicality which I debunked anyway. You’re out of your league. Just sit down. Don’t trifle with me, you will get pwnd.

it's just rhetoric, great meaning winners, the quote came before the post so the phrasing is somewhat irrelevant to the point it's trying to make,

my point of it being bs is because of the programs, I'm forced by law to opt into to help people I've never met, through a corrupt government where the money goes missing constantly, to irresponsible people who collect welfare checks and sit on their porches drinking beer. I'm from the slums so i've seen how much people abuse the system rather than working and I've alway been honest and hard working. Sure it helps people that need it, but there is weak oversight that the system gets the crap abused out of it. if they cracked down on the abuse these programs cost would be cut in half.
it was my mistake to broadly suggest taxes are bs.

decentralized in distribution. yes whales can still affect the price but the point is there is no central issuance of the currency and no central point of failure and no single entity can decide to control the supply , and if they do we can just make a new currency and ignore the beaurocratic Keynesian bullshit currency. that's what decentralized and permission less and open are refferinng to. you no longe belong to any one national currency. decentralized

The fact that this will work is because this is the perfect free market system with no government intervention and game theory incentive to play by the rules. I think mining would certainly be a natural supply and demand equilibrium. What are your thoughts?
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:41:45
that's good, I've been watching a lot of Andreas Antonopoulos lectures and he was talking about how with the growth of crypto, we'll hit these scalability problems incrementally and it'll improve in the free market sense. like the internet's growth spurts and stunts, I remember when I had to wait for youtube videos to load all the way before pressing play.

"Regulators across the world have grown increasingly concerned about the immutability and decentralized nature of blockchain transactions, which they say makes them ideal tools for money launderers" this is such weak scapegoat bureaucratic spew. I really hope crypto eliminates centralized currency just for that

I think It will naturally always meet equilibrium, the fees will go up and down depending on the traffic of market volume cycling and adoption. When the fees are higher, it takes longer to break them and the real miners are trying to complete a blockchain and get the full coin reward rather than the scraps.

@_date: 2018-04-04 05:29:11
actually I'm just saying 1 transactional fee is the least of your worries if it goes up exponentially. I understand u mean that people won't use bitcoin if the fees get too high. two things, the software can be changed in adjustment with the market. btc has a serially increased difficulty for hashing to battle the fact that the value of the reward went up as usage went up. the scaling issue has many solutions being considered right now. also, the fees went up to $38 yet transactions were still being made. because a free market will optimize at the market price meaning, if transactions were being made at $38 each, that's because there were people willing to spend $38 a transaction. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:16:23
aren't there are easier ways to make BTC an acceptable payment? my buddy added it to his store in like 5 seconds. or are you gonna say those 2 cases are different. if so explain please i'd like to learn
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:40:11
um wrong, bitcoin has inherent value4 because it requires an enormous amount of energy to be mined, so it's backed by the most valuable commodity in the modern world
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:04:17
and Collective lol!
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:36:08
or unsafe transaction methods such as any other form of currency... because bitcoin outplays all of them
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:23:10
if someone wanted to buy a deep pit, it would be valuable because the pit requires manpower, value comes from demand agreed, you kinda made my point
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:41:18
Thank you great article, I think I further understand that value is mutual hallucination that humans share. Like gold is just shiny and scarce and isn’t used for as much things as say oil. So bitcoin is clearly valuable simply because it’s scarce, a medium, fungible and easy to exchange. So what gives it value is the fact that someone is willing to exchange resources for it?
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:43:17
Well I think what I’m really trying to tackle is when people say it’s not worth anything because it’s 1’s and 0’s and I’m saying that value is an abstract construct but it is elevated by the fact that it’s backed by energy which is the most valuable industrial commodity 
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:34:46
That’s what I said haha but got downvoted.
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:45:54
I’ve actually always thought that way about currency. But I guess I need a better word than intrinsic because what I want to describe is the abstract idea of value and if there’s a definitive cause for it, or if it’s just butterfly economics of the crowd deciding what has value and what doesn’t.

@_date: 2019-05-05 19:13:01
Agreed. But that’s a long term play, I think in order for it to spread it needs diverse philosophy and protocol structures as ports of entry. The journey is crypto maximalism, while the end, assuming it’s still the longest chain, is btc maximalism
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:05:03
