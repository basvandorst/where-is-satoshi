Bitcoiners think the 2-3% inflation USD has every year is somehow conning them out of money. But they'll happily sit on their Bitcoins that inflate 60-70% in a year, because it's controlled by computer code, like that's somehow superior.

Yeah, that's kind of the downside of an open-source creation. Nobody wants to pay for advertising when there's no direct profit.


Anybody that would be interested and willing to invest in Bitcoin has probably already found it. Bitcoin made the rounds in tech circles two or three years ago. It's not something mainstream consumers would really be interested in after a 30-second ad, so again no profit, why bother? They make enough money from the dedicated Bitcoiners.

If you find a good bank (which isn't that hard, credit unions are pretty popular), the only restriction is don't spend more money than you have. Too many people overdraw their accounts and get pissed when the bank charges them fees. People mention specific situations like "they switched around my transactions to make me overdraw." Well don't put up with that shit. Walk in there, close your accounts, and find a new bank.
And since dollars are kind of Bitcoin's biggest competitor, I think it's a relevant point that bank accounts (and top-notch security) are free.

I assume difficulty is also increasing? Unless there are some groundbreaking gains in microprocessor technology, it's going to become more and more expensive for miners to keep up the profits they're making now, and a smaller block subsidy only makes it harder. I don't care to do the math, but I'm going to make an educated guess that it would require a lot more transactions than we have now. Eventually, Bitcoin will reach a point where it's finally managed to become popular, or will descend into a feedback loop of decreasing transaction numbers, miners leaving, increasing transaction fees to compensate, which means less transactions, etc.

You'd be in the minority then. The youngest generations were the first ones to adopt debit cards, with the older generations sticking with checks. Credit and debit cards are still as popular as ever. Sure, people complain about fees, but they're just complaining about their bank, not the entire concept of banks or debit cards. Furthermore, complaints don't always mean they really desire an alternative. People complain about their job every evening but are fine with continuing to work there. Unless Bitcoin offers benefits far above and beyond the existing systems (spoiler: it doesn't), nobody is going to use it. They use debit/credit cards *because it works*, is so incredibly easy, zero risk, and accepted everywhere. Even the most technologically incapable person can easily use one, and none of the same can be said for Bitcoin.

That's a skewed idea of capitalism.

I *could* let you watch it for $2, but that doesn't make me as much money. This isn't socialism or a damn charity.
Consumers (specifically those who pirate) need to realize that no one owes them anything. If I want to only show Game of Thrones on a premium cable channel, than that's just the way it is. Get over it. Wait for the DVD to come out. If you can't even do that, then you need to re-evaluate your unhealthy addiction to media.

I'm no expert on why the stock market crashed, but I do know there was a bank run, and the banks simply didn't have enough money on hand to pay back all of the depositors. People lost their entire savings. The FDIC remedied that problem: if a bank is insolvent or cannot pay back its depositors, the FDIC covers the depositors for the amount they are owed, and absorbs the bank. It's also entirely funded from payments by banks in the system.
[Wikipedia leads me to believe that economists are still arguing over why it happened.]( It all started after the stock market crash though, and after a decade as great as the Roaring Twenties, the huge climb in stock prices has to come back down (in this case, dramatically).

Can't wait to see how far you guys move the goalposts via the word "reasonably" before you stop being too lazy and entitled to pay for something.


Tell me why *everyone* shouldn't pirate then? Why can't we all just be like you? Would the content even be produced then?
So there must be some "cost" to pirating and it comes from the fact that it costs money to create content. It was created with the expectation that they own it and users are expected to pay if they want to see it. If users pirate it instead of purchasing it, then the creators make no income and don't bother creating anymore.
GG pirates, the only endgame here is the collapse of markets that rely on income from intellectual property. There's little reason to stop pirating once you've started, just keep moving those goalposts.
Why do you think PC versions of games are often crap ports from console or still riddled with bugs? Because 50% of the userbase is just going to pirate it anyway. Might as well focus on the console market where pirating is much less of a problem.
Why don't you flit on over to ThePirateBay and look up some popular shows available on Netflix and tell me how many downloads they have? 0? If not, then your solution clearly isn't working.


Then you don't get the benefits of premium cable, which includes the ability to watch Game of Thrones on release day.

It doesn't, which makes it so sad that reduces itself to making fun of USD instead of being aware of the flaws in their own internet tokens and fixing them.
There's also some preconceived notion here that inflation is inherently bad, which is not true at all. Massively inflating in a short period of time is bad, yes, but only Bitcoin has experienced that. USD's inflation has always been relatively small; it's just been around a lot longer than Bitcoin.

Correct, they don't.


It's much easier to steal from merchants that sell products for 0 confirmations than it is to constantly chargeback. Visa will wise up soon enough if you're doing too many chargebacks and drop you.
Possible scenarios:
* Walk into a store and buy 5 $500 TVs. With 0 confirmations I could be an hour away with $2500 worth of stolen stuff before they realize no money is coming. Repeat as many times as you like: Bitcoin addresses and accomplices are cheap. Pick the most expensive thing in the store.
* Digital store selling digital goods. Are you going to make me wait 10 minutes - 1 hour to download what I just bought, or let me download it with 0 confirmations? If the latter I'd have the product before you ever realized there was no money. Again, repeat as much as you like.
With credit/debit cards you have to have enough money/high credit limit to begin with, your identity is linked to the account, and the merchant could demand the product back if I chargeback. Even if I got away with it once, it wouldn't work multiple times if I wanted to keep my credit card. Visa isn't stupid; they know what fraud looks like.


Correct, they wouldn't, but this isn't the prime problem for merchants here.

[This Wall Street Journal article]( states banks are seeing cuts in other forms of revenue and have to make it up somewhere. Personal bank accounts don't make a bank very much money. The contents of most people's checking accounts, a few hundred dollars, is a paltry sum compared to the bank's business accounts and loan divisions. That money also needs to be basically 24/7 accessible to the account holder so it's hard to loan it to other people. It's more of a gateway to a friendly relationship with a bank, in the hopes you'll come to them first if you need a loan for whatever reason.
I'm sure banks make up lots of shit about "losing revenue" but if charging people $30 because they haven't learned basic money management skills is what it takes to keep banks offering personal checking accounts at all, then it's fine by me.
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:39:45


A $30 fee is quite reasonable depending on how their system is set up. It's a flat fee, and you could have overdrawn anything from $1-$200 before the bank managed to cut you off. $30 seems reasonable to me when you consider the costs the bank has of dealing with a bounced transaction, and forwarding extra money, especially with a large amount.




We don't have those in the US. Overdrawing is "you fucked up" territory, not pre-arranged territory here. So it is very much demanding a free loan from the bank if you don't agree with the $30 fee. The only pre-arrangement here is "if you spend more money than is in your account, you will be charged $30."


I mean, I'm not an idiot and don't overdraw my account, which is the easiest way to avoid this problem entirely. If you need to buy something on credit short-term, use a credit card. If you pay it off at the end of the month, there's no fee.
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:24:21

It didn't fall apart in the 50s, or 60s, or 70s, 80s, 90s, or anytime in the new millennium, but gold-bug libertarians will keep hoarding their precious metals and Bitcoins and saying "any day/month/year now it's gonna collapse."

We only have to look back at the 19th/early 20th century South to see how communities mete out their own warped justice.

Exactly. This whole "blocksize debate" is all the proof you need. Yes, debate is good, but eventually you need to come to a decision. At the rate this community is going, you'll be arguing about it forever.
There's always going to be people who disagree. Have you ever seen a corporate meeting? You can't please everyone. You discuss, and then put it to a vote or the man on top makes the decision. Then, *everyone follows that choice*. They don't fracture into competing groups that fight with each other, which this community is about to do if the blocksize update is ever put into action without the whole community's support.
That whole CEO, director, manager hierarchy is the only reason shit gets done. Otherwise employees will argue for days or each work in different directions focusing on their own individual goals.
I'm not saying Bitcoin needs a hierarchy, but it does need a direction to go. Vote on it if you have to, but at least do something.

Louis Vuitton purses are functionally the same as any other high-quality purse, but they can sell theirs for hundreds of dollars and make more money because of their popularity. If I have a very popular TV show, I can make more money limiting access and charging more. Is that not my right as a business in a capitalist economy?
You don't think these companies have entire marketing and finance divisions that figure out the best way to make money? Their goal is not to let everyone watch the show in an affordable manner. *They are here to make money*, and making it "easy and affordable" is not always the best way to make money. Sometimes, that is the best way (look at Netflix), but sometimes it isn't, and you're just going to have to accept that.

The mafia also only protects you if you have money in the first place. Having no income isn't a crime under the government and you still get police and fire service, a military to protect you, bus service, and everything else. Even if you can't pay your taxes, as long as you file and make an honest attempt they will set up a payment plan. It's only malicious tax evasion that leads to jail.

I'm asking you, is there anything wrong in that situation? If I wanted to read *To Kill a Mockingbird* why wouldn't I buy the $2 book over the $20 book? Why does the person who pretends to have written a book allowed to collect profit off of something someone else wrote?


Shows on Netflix are still heavily pirated, so I don't think it's just a service problem. It's a "I like free shit, and don't want to pay for anything problem."


Wow, that's incredibly vague. What do you mean by easy? If I let you download my movie DRM-free, 1080-HD, etc. straight from my website but charge $100 for it, is that considered easy enough for you? If $100 is too expensive for you, do you just not watch it and find something else to do. Or do you just decide "Eh, $100 is too much, I think I'll just pirate it." Because that's not a service problem. That's an entitlement problem; the misguided view that you are entitled to everything ever created by anybody at a price point of your own choosing.


There are no convenient competitors in the world of digital piracy. You are literally copying intellectual content *for free*. No one can compete with that. Intellectual content would not be created in the first place if you can't make money off of it. Creators would have to beg for donations or go get another job and only create in their free time, because assholes think they're entitled to everything for free if it doesn't meet their "service" standards.


This is why patents exist. Do you think patents have legitimate uses and benefits? Copyright is just the digital version of patent and does the exact same thing. Just because modern technology lets you copy something digitally doesn't mean it's right.
Also, that "other person" didn't have thousands of dollars in research and development costs that the original inventor has. They just waltzed in, looked at a product, copied it, and threw it on the shelf at a lower price point generating pure profit. The inventor has to sell at a higher price point because he has R &amp; D costs to pay back. Do you see the unfairness here? Why create anything when someone else can just copy your idea and sell it way cheaper?
Piracy as an economic model is just flawed. There is no reason *not* to pirate. The only endgame is everyone pirates, and tell me how that's going to work out.

Maybe the payment goes directly to the merchant, sans Newegg's cut? If they accept Bitcoin they'd have to redo their merchant account settlement system to accept the whole payment themselves, convert to fiat, and then forward a part of the fiat to the merchant. That's a bunch of extra steps for what amounts to less than 0.5% of their income.

Except "American living in &lt;not America&gt;" is rather uncommon if not rare. I'm not sure why he would keep his money in his original bank either. 
*Of course* there's a fee to withdraw in a totally different country on the other side of the world, and *of course* there's a fee to use this random ATM to withdraw money from my bank tens of thousands of miles away. That ATM was not put there to service the customers of every bank in the entire world for free. A $3 fee is better than "Sorry you do not have an account affiliated with the bank that owns this ATM."
Paying one set of fees to deposit his paycheck in a local bank using local currency would eliminate the vast majority of his problems. They should have plenty of ATMs where he lives.

Bitcoin's "economy" only needs an increase of 10% to match that inflation. If there's 100,000 people regularly buying/trading in Bitcoin, you only need 10,000 new people. I would hope an emerging technology that is supposed to go mainstream any day (according to the cult anyway) would be able to attain that, but alas, it seems no one wants to trade (or even buy Bitcoin).

Why wouldn't people just continue to pirate it for free? Some nice dude pays the fee, downloads a copy and re-uploads it for everyone to download for free. Now we're back to square one where people pirate shit because they like free shit.


When the fuck did consumers get to make demands over how something should be sold? Designer brand purses cost hundreds of dollars but are made out of the same material as any other decent purse. It's quite clear you're paying for the designer name on the bag. The business knows people will pay good money for that, and so they charge hundreds of dollars for it. So tell me, if I know people will pay for premium HBO why am I not allowed to sell my product that way? **Why aren't you outraged at designer handbag manufacturers?**
Louis Vuitton could sell their purses for $20, but that wouldn't be a smart business decision. HBO could sell Game of Thrones for a small fee, but that's not a very good business decision. **And for some reason, society thinks sellers of digital goods aren't allowed to make good business decisions. Why?** HBO *could* sell their show on Bittorrent for a fee, but to make the same amount of money they are making with the premium cable channels, that fee would probably be unreasonably high in the eyes of pirating-inclined consumers, and you (or 99% of people) would still pirate it because &lt;insert new flawed reason here&gt;.
Pirating content just shows that you really want to experience their content, but would never have paid for it anyway. There's no point in attempting to cater to you, because you'll probably just move the goalposts and continue to pirate it for free. You show no respect for capitalism when you pirate, and the only thing to do is enforce copyright law or forget about you and focus on those willing to be paying customers.
*The correct way to show dissatisfaction with service models* is to boycott their products. Don't buy them, don't pirate them, don't use them in any way. You can air your grievances and explain why you won't buy their product and what it would take to make you buy it. The business may or may not decide to cater to you to get your money, but you're just going to have to deal with their decision.
I find it hard to take anyone seriously who complains about movie and music distribution while pirating movies and music. You clearly have no respect for the economic system of distributing movies and music (and all goods) in the first place. You support capitalism when it suits you, but then suddenly advocate some socialist entitlement to everything when things don't go your way. It boggles the mind. I read a Reddit post about a guy who hated EA (pretty typical) and refused to play any of their games. He wouldn't look at them or interact with them in any way. His kids knew not to ask for EA games in the store. I have a million times more respect for that guy than any person who pirates as a form of "protest."
To reiterate: businesses just see pirating customers as a lost cause. The only thing they can do is enforce copyright law or try to put better DRM on the next product.

So you take it upon yourself to manage money in a complicated fashion. That's cool.


Which is against the rules of the contract you signed when you opened the accounts


Did the contract you signed say "well if it's only a few cents, then it's okay..."? No.


You mean, the bank did exactly what the contract you signed specified?


It's not a small error. The system is not just going to loan "a few cents" to every Joe Schmoe who can't keep track of their checkbook. This isn't a charity. And this isn't an error. You overdrew your account. You spent more money than you have. The bank doesn't owe you shit, and you're demanding they loan out money *for free*. The only person who erred here is you.


That's nice of your bank to do something nice like that for you, since according to the terms of the contract, you owe them $35. Yet here you are complaining like they did something wrong.
But I'm sure you're totally ready to be your own bank with Bitcoin. You'll have to ask yourself to loan yourself "a few cents" and when you realize that isn't possible, you just won't be able to make your purchase because of poor money management skills.
Get a checkbook. Get multiple checkbooks if you need them. Keep a running balance of your accounts, and turn off overdraft protection. Problem solved.

The price inflation is still horrendous though, which is pretty much all that matters if you ever want Bitcoin to go mainstream. Although I guess it kind of has to go mainstream before you get any price stability; chicken and egg, again.
Also, the main reason the price is dropping is there hasn't been a corresponding 9% increase in the "Bitcoin economy" (or demand for Bitcoin). Your supposedly infallible computer code (backed by math, right guyz?) can't seem to realize that the "Bitcoin economy" doesn't need anymore coins right now.

One could argue that "the natural course of the markets" is sitting in a much worse depression until the market meanders its way back to prosperity. This applies to the more recent bank bailouts: do we let the big banks fail, plunging the economy into the dark depths with unemployment rising with no end in sight for some indefinite period of time *or* bail them out and deal with a much manageable situation that will eventually recover in a few years?
We should never have let the situation get to where it was in 2008 but we're here now and have to make a decision.
Have you read Game of Thrones? When Jaime killed the mad king Aerys, he was known derisively throughout the realm as a kingslayer. He was supposed to be guarding the king and backstabbed him instead. Much later in the books we learn the king was going to burn the city down, and Jaime basically saved them.
Bailing out the banks was the lesser of two evils, one could argue.

Any knowledgeable adult should realize that deposits are not instant. You need to leave adequate time for that money to enter the account before spending it. It's as simple as calling the bank's phone number and the automated system will tell you the balance of the account and confirm the deposit (or check online or an app). With modern technology it's ridiculously easy to confirm your balance and this shouldn't be a problem at all. Leave a buffer amount of money in the account at all times if you're really so worried.

Bitcoin needs a fuckton of hope, because without a several orders of magnitude increase in transaction numbers, there'll be no profit left for miners after a halving or two combined with the steady difficulty increase. You'll have to increase transaction fees to make them stick around, which makes what's already a lackluster implementation even crappier, and will just drive down transaction numbers even further. Bitcoin's economic policy requires it to be popular, and even then it still has some big errors.

I could say Bitcoin is unfair because practically half the coins that will ever exist are in the hands of less than 100,000 people.


I'm sure there are complex economic arguments about this, and one could talk all day, but the ability to expand and contract the amount of money allows you to match it with the growth of the economy or pursue other economic goals, which can change as time goes on. Something like Bitcoin, which just prints money at a decreasing rate and then stops, has no intelligence or ability to assess the corresponding economy. The creator just made a guess at what the right economic policy and timeframe is, and let it go for 150 years. It's got a cult following after 5 years, but in 10 or 20 years you may realize "Hey we need more coins" or "Hey we need to stop producing coins" or "hey, this deflation sucks" and you can't change it.

In a way patents are what keep this from happening in a negative way. A patent helps someone who invented something in their garage secure their rights to it and allow them time to start up a company to market it or safely allow them to pitch it to companies willing to manufacture it.
Most inventions can be easily taken apart to see how they work and copied. A large company will almost always be able to copy and put to market a smaller company's invention before the smaller company ever recuperates their investment (which could take years). The large company has more resources, more advertising ability, and a larger client base. 
Without patents, you wouldn't even have to acknowledge that it's someone else's creation. Whether it's an invention, or copyright in general, being able to take someone's book, movie, game, whatever, claim it's mine and sell it is just ethically and legally wrong. Yes, eventually intellectual property should enter the public domain and reasonable limits need to be set on copyright terms instead of the horrendous ones we have now, but you'd be naive to think the amount and quality of creative work that is made today would still exist without IP. You'd have to radically redefine our economic system if you think intellectual property should be free from the moment of creation. It wouldn't work under our current capitalist system.

Take away the belief and fanaticism surrounding Bitcoin, and you have some strings of numbers in a computer.
"Real, organic value" is essentially what you can do with something besides use it as currency. Gold is shiny and people like to use it for jewelry or electronics. You can't really do much with USD or Bitcoins, though. Their worth is only what you assign to them (and a hell of a lot more people trust the US government than an internet cult).
Also, Bitcoin's fiscal policy (the distribution of coins, etc.) is destroying what little economy it ever had, so it's hard to see any future in it.

This stuff is covered in grade school and high school history if you grew up in the US. Things were really bad before the Food and Drug Administration existed. Companies could pass off anything as food or medicine and make any claim they wanted about what it would cure.










[History of the Food and Drug Administration](




Yelp only works for restaurants. You would have no idea what goes into the foods you buy at the grocery store (or the food that restaurants cook with). Companies only follow sanitation and food preparation laws because they have to. If they didn't they would quickly stop doing that and push out the cheapest product that was still somewhat edible. Sure, the wealthier may be able to afford high quality food, but the poor are stuck with something you can't really call food. Then there's everything you wouldn't even know could end up in your food. It might not look or taste bad at first, but could end up being harmful.
And market feedback doesn't really work with medicines. Oh, only 100 people had to die to realize we *maybe* shouldn't buy this product. Companies could literally test their concoctions on the market. I'm sure you think reputation backlash will prevent companies from doing this, but that doesn't work. They will always try this because there are always people that just buy the cheapest thing claiming to work; it should just be straight up illegal.
And finally, if market feedback worked so well, why were there all these problems back in the early 20th century? The public was literally crying out for the government to deal with this when it was exposed. Poor immigrants can't do much to change the way companies act. Sure things moved a little slower back then and we have things like the internet today, but instant communication doesn't let you see the inner workings of factories or food-packing plants.
I don't think I need to prove environmental problems for you. Companies would care very little for the environment. Most consumers wouldn't know about it or wouldn't care themselves because the effects take years or decades to appear. Pesticides can run off into streams and ruin drinking water, factory pollution ruins the air. Just look at China, where their economy is so fueled by manufacturing that environmental concerns take a backseat. Even with existing regulation, this is still a problem in first-world nations.




Okay, but market feedback doesn't solve everything. You'd think there'd be one successful society on earth working this way if it was such a great thing. Yet every society with a high standard of living has a rather active government looking out for the people's best interests. Capitalism and greed aren't looking out for anyone's best interest but the company.
While third-world African countries have governments, those with little power are not great places to live. I was arguing that solid and stable government correlates very well with standard of living on earth.

There is no good reason for this stuff to be legal, and anyone supplying it is well aware of its destructive effects.

Hey, I'm not the guy that [said Bitcoins would be worth greater than $10,000 by 2015](


While you didn't provide any sources, the government saying a dollar is worth this much gold doesn't mean the market values it at that (see: Argentina). And further, you're operating under the assumption that inflation is always bad and can never be good. Small amounts of inflation can be beneficial. It motivates people to invest their money in the economy instead of hoarding it. Businesses would not exist unless someone is willing to fund them, and when your money generates new value just sitting around, there's no reason to risk funding a business.

You can throw that shit in a low risk investment plan and easily outpace inflation over any span where inflation is actually noticeable.

It's a "reasonably foreseeable act." Heroin is illegal ostensibly because it's ridiculously easy to become addicted and kill yourself overdosing. Anyone supplying heroin knows this.

If I sign a waiver releasing the guy who owns the rock-climbing wall from any culpability if I injure myself, that doesn't matter IF HE KNEW THE WALL WAS STRUCTURALLY UNSAFE AND UNFIT FOR USE. Similarly, you are responsible for what your illegal drugs cause if it was something easily foreseeable.

The government did not decide to charge him for that.

The point is that your "tech / programming circles" are not what made the computer market explode. Companies like Microsoft created usable GUIs that any idiot can learn to use; they brought computers to the masses. You didn't need to know how to code, or interpret the foreign words and numbers on the screen that a computer is spitting out at you (and then respond with equally foreign commands). You just need to move a mouse to click on things that you can easily understand because it's all visual and interactive.
If you want the masses to use your product, it needs to be dead simple, and you shouldn't have to explain the technical and economic underpinnings to make it sound good. Nobody cares about that stuff. Nobody cares about how much money is created or how it gets into their wallet. They just want money that works and holds a constant value. Bitcoin can't do either of those things; it isn't simple to use by any stretch of the imagination, and none of its "advantages" are worth anything to mainstream folks.

Because a majority of your democratically-elected representatives in Congress voted to make them legal/illegal, and it was then signed by the President, in accordance with the Constitution. That's as good as it gets. You can work to peacefully change the law, or practice civil disobedience and do your protesting from jail. While a good part of society may want to legalize marijuana, they probably don't think it's worth going to jail over, and would rather let peaceful change take its course. Something that basic human rights may be worth fighting over, but smoking marijuana is not one of them.
This has nothing to do with Ulbricht's crimes however, which were just horrendous. Kingpin of a criminal enterprise, reckless endangerment of people's lives, and no guilt whatsoever.

The next section clearly lays out the legal basis for his culpability in the deaths.
* He was profiting off of each sale and so was clearly a business partner (he even used the words himself).
* [U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B)]( - defendant responsible for all harm caused by “reasonably foreseeable acts” of others involved in jointly undertaken activity
* *United States v. Faulkner* - “While [the defendant] may not have played a direct role in manufacturing or distributing the heroin that caused [the victim’s] death, he was part of the conspiracy that distributed the heroin.”
* *United States v. Westry* - “Where a conspirator is involved in distributing drugs to addicts, some of which are even administered intravenously, it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence that one or more of those addicts may overdose and die.”
You're not a robot. You have critical thinking skills and can see what the obvious effects of your actions are.

Giving an addict highly addictive and dangerous drugs is a failure of your own personal responsibility in the eyes of society.

Exactly. You see the same thing in the pharmaceutical industry. You can spend hundreds of millions of dollars chasing what turns out to be a dead end. Patents that ensure them a decade of exclusivity are the only way for them to recuperate the costs of developing a drug and all the failed avenues before they found something that worked. That's just the nature of drug research, it's hit and miss.
Without patents, no one would waste money researching and developing because that money would never be earned back, *or* created drugs would be monopolized forever, carefully protected secrets by the company. That stifles innovation more than anything.

You do realize that patents *encourage* innovation? It's an incentive to publicize your invention. The patent becomes public record and you get a decade to profit off of it before anyone is allowed to directly copy it as an incentive to publicizing. In the meantime, anyone can examine the patent to generate their own ideas or after the exclusionary period is up use the invention in their own products.
If patents didn't exist, companies would be forced to hide their inventions or everyone would copy them right away. They need to recoup on the investment spent researching and developing. A company could just hide the inner workings of their invention as long as they want. If there's no incentive to publicize it (like a patent), then might as well keep it hidden. See: Coca-Cola. Their recipe has been secret for decades because they never patented it and are confident no one can replicate it. Thus, they've had a monopoly on it for decades. In a world without patents, *every invention* would be this way.
Also, you know, there's no reason to spend time and money inventing something if the company next door can just copy my invention and sell it for cheap because they have no research and development costs to recuperate like I do. A patent allows you to recuperate those costs and make inventing a worthwhile endeavor at all. Copyright is essentially the same idea (although the term limits got way out of hand). 
You live in a capitalist society. Nobody is making things for the good of humanity; they're creating things to make money. Take away the only way they can recuperate investments and make a profit, and there will be no creating.

Jury nullification is essentially vigilantism. It was rampant after the civil war and before the civil rights movement. If a black man was accused a crime, he was guilty in the eyes of a white jury. Every single time. And good luck getting a conviction of a white person doing something to a black person. It just didn't happen.
Lynchings in the south? That was basically abstract jury nullification. We don't need an actual court and don't need actual laws. I heard a rumor this black man did something bad so let's go sentence him to death.

No, it's not. You're taking a robotic view, where you are only personally responsible for the literal action you did. Society has a brain and can see the nuances of life. A burger is statistically harmless and prepared under the right conditions society deems it safe for sale and eating. Also people like burgers and they don't kill you unless you make a thousand other poor decisions in your life. Heroin, cocaine, and meth have much more real, immediate, destructive effects, and society (through fear, reason, experience, whatever) wants nothing to do with them.
Life isn't always fair, bud. Cars are useful and most people know how to drive safely drive them. Society still functions when we all drive cars. That's why they're legal. Heroin and cocaine do not let society function properly, and society doesn't want to deal with the harmful effects and strains their users put on society. Deal with it.
And there will always be something "most statistically likely to kill you but still legal." Duh. If heroin was legal, I'm sure that would supersede cars. 
Society's laws are arbitrary, but in general supported by a majority. Nobody wants a crypto-utopia where the sale of *anything* is legal and we have to deal with the societal effects of *everything*.

So you're saying if you don't specifically agree to be taxed, then you should be able to opt out of taxes? Fine, that's cool. The problem is, a society long ago decided to opt into tax collection and claimed this land as the home of their society (and protected by their government). You were born here, and it was implicitly assumed that you would be willing to follow the laws.
If you don't want to be taxed, I think it's fair that you don't get the benefits of government. *That means you can't live here anymore.* This is our society and if you want to create your own society, you need to go somewhere else. You have no natural right to this land that has been part of our society for a long time (or any more claim than those already living here do).

Also, this diagram totally leaves out the fact that part of the reason those third parties exist is to protect customers. When the internet first came out, typing your credit card number into a random website was some shady-ass shit. It made a lot more sense to store your credit card and/or banking information with one trusted party that can interface with all of these websites without them all having to know your information.
Credit cards also have the additional ability to chargeback. If the random shady-ass website or eBay seller sends me a box of rocks instead of the computer I ordered, I can get my money back. If I paid in Bitcoin, they can laugh all the way to the bank, and all I can do is whine on some internet forum.
Seller reputation is easy to fake on sites like eBay, and new startups always start with random shady-ass websites. If you want to support brand new companies but have no idea if they will deliver on promises (Butterfly Labs, anyone?), you better be paying with a credit card. **Just look at the people who pre-ordered a miner from Butterfly Labs with Bitcoin. That's Exhibit fucking A as to how Bitcoin will never fully succeed. It requires way too much trust between the buyer and seller.** Mediators/arbitrators?

Sorry, but this is impossible. You're talking about a currency that is made to be anonymous and hard to trace. Your ability to catch criminals with it got thrown out the window when you threw out all of the banking regulation/know-your-customer rules etc. You can kiss that money goodbye anyway because its now probably held by someone in a jurisdiction no Western police have access to. Hackers and shady Bitcoin companies are based in Eastern Europe for a reason: no one can touch them there. Your local police's jurisdiction ends at the nearest county border, and national/international police forces have much bigger problems to deal with than you stupidly putting all of your wealth in something so easily stolen away forever.

Can it store my physical goods in a safe deposit box? Can it extend me a line of credit? Can it take care of my investments/stocks/portfolios? etc.
Also, the entirety of Bitcoin transactions could currently be handled by a little server rack sitting in the basement of one of these banks. Decentralization is the only thing that makes it require stupid amounts of energy. I would expect a bank to be incredibly more efficient at processing transactions, since you know, they can trust themselves and the banks they partner with.

You're poor, remember? Lawsuits? Hah. And you can't afford the good stuff. Even if you could, the company could be lying to you. Or they could switch it out, once you think it's safe. **Also, someone shouldn't have to get sick or die for the rest of us figure out it's unsafe to eat.** Multiple people would probably have to die before it even becomes linked to the food.


Except the company can just tell them to fuck right off. They're the cheapest game in town, and 95% of people just look at the price, not who certified it.
There's also the problem of scams. Snake oil salesman would peddle drugs to cure anything, and how many people have to get scammed before the rest of us figure out these drugs don't actually do anything (or are actually harmful)?
Private "certification" companies can also be much more easily paid off than the government. You've neglected to mention how these certification companies are funded, so they should be pretty eager for some bribes.

Oh hey, look at this, the FDA saved thousands of lives:

Nobody is going to want to do that when stuff like eBay works right in the browser. Unless they're desperate for drugs, and don't have the social skills to buy them on the street.


And no recourse when the seller doesn't send you what you paid for. You can cheat out 1 in 30 people and still have a 97% positive feedback rating. Or, do a few trades to establish a good rating, undercut all the competitors and then cheat out the 100 or so orders that come in all at once. People are dumb and fall for this every time. They won't be coming back to your website either (unless they're addicted to the drugs you sell or whatever, but that's totally not your fault right).


Huh, so now it's exactly like eBay with a middleman, but I have to pay a fee myself, whereas eBay has no fees for the consumer? Why am I here again? Oh that's right, to buy drugs from people who totally won't scam me. I'm totally sure the "trusted third party" and drug dealer aren't in cahoots. Even if the mediator is legit, I can't wait to see all the elaborate scams where the seller manages to convince the mediator he sent legitimate goods. This is totally better than eBay, which would have been cheaper in the first place for anything that wasn't illegal. But that's the cost of illegal drugs I guess.

There is a difference between basically harmless drugs like marijuana and harder drugs like meth or heroine that just ruin lives and communities. Those will never be legal and should never be.
You guys love to claim you're innocent of whatever someone does with the meth you sell them, but you're more than likely just feeding some poor person's addiction, while their child is neglected, and all the money they're paying you was from stuff they stole and/or sold to feed their drug addiction.

I don't think that's really the FDA's problem, but just a result of other inefficiencies in the system (or other countries having lower standards of "safe").

But like 30% of them would get sick, and some would die. Society believes that safety is more important than letting people gamble on a cheap possibly-doesn't-work-and-may-kill-you product.

@_date: 2015-07-08 03:03:57


Because the common masses (aka mainstream consumers) like Visa and want to pay with that. You can accept Visa and make money, or not accept Visa and not make money.
If you don't offer Visa, people will just shop somewhere else. Businesses don't really get to pick what payment method to use in a world where they compete for customers; the consumer picks.


But... it doesn't. Like right now. I could accept your zero confirmation transaction and possibly be defrauded. Or wait 36 hrs.


Sorry, but if your business has that much fraud, you're doing it wrong. Like shoplifting, these losses are built into the business model. You shouldn't be losing any significant amount of money due to them. And "takes days" shouldn't really matter to any business that isn't about to go under.
I shouldn't have to tell you these things. Look at how popular Visa is. That's your answer right there.

Lol, okay. We won't come to save you when the meth addict with a gun comes into your house at night looking for stuff to steal to pay for his addiction. And you can go find him yourself to get your stuff back. 
Also, I fully expect you to recognize your local neighborhood drug dealers as outstanding members of the community and would be happy to invite them over for dinner.


Again, lol. Your anarchy is very edgy. Please go move somewhere that doesn't "force" you to pay tax dollars if it bothers you so much. I'm sure the roving gangs will totally respect your right to live in peace.
And what exactly are you expecting when no one is "forced" to pay taxes? Civil services fund themselves? Nobody will donate shit just like nobody here donates to OpenBazaar. You're hoarding your internet tokens to get rich. Somebody else will pay for all that stuff. Should we all just sit in our house with a rifle to defend our land?


This isn't a moral high ground. Just what any educated person would tell you about the effects of drug addiction on people and the community at large. Or just look at a map and see how many nation states vs. anarchic paradises there are. That should be your first clue.




Where did you get that? Is the person selling drugs a victim? No. They're profiting off of victims. They can spend a few months in jail to rethink their life. Obviously, those addicted to drugs should get some form of rehabilitation to bring them back to society (and answer in some way for other crimes they may have committed).

I mean, someone without a finance/economics degree really *can't* contribute to these discussions. They're very complicated situations. US money policy and economic decisions aren't decided by popular vote for a reason; the vast, vast majority of people understand nothing of deep economic issues and it quickly just becomes a popularity contest of who can make their idea sound like the best thing for the common people.
Just look at where your typical Bitcoiner's economic knowledge is what he gleaned from ten-minute YouTube videos. Inflation is universally hated on this sub, and deflationary currency is considered the cure-all to all of our problems. Same with the "limited amount of coins." Nobody cares about the future downsides of deflation, limited money supply, or inability to change your money policy ten years down the road because it's all run by a computer program.
There's no harm in explaining to laypeople why you're doing something, but there is a reason to leave the big decisions to smarter people. The Bitcoin community at large will argue about the blocksize until the end of time, accomplishing nothing, when a more centralized decision structure would have discussed and then picked a direction and went with it. You can't argue forever.
I'm not sure the developers are inherently qualified for the job, though. Sure they can code but unless they also have relevant economics and finance experience, they're not "experts" in my mind either.

Bitcoinland is full of hacks. People get their coins stolen every day, via viruses, social engineering, or actual hacks.


Well, most people aren't criminals so this is a rather obscure problem. 99.99% of people have never had assets forfeited so it's not something they look for in a currency.


But Bitcoin just makes you the bank. And if we've learned anything so far, your average person is woefully less equipped to be a bank than an actual bank. See above: if you lose your coins or they get stolen, that's it, you're fucked, they're gone. That's never going to happen with an actual bank.

Drug research is hard. Human chemistry is complicated. You'll hit a million dead-ends before you ever find a promising lead. The successful drug has to recover the cost of those million dead-ends as well. You may have a very promising drug that works good in rats, but kills the monkey every time; welp, $10 million down the drain and back to square one. Or you get to human testing and the side effects are just too numerous to put the drug on the market.
So you finally have something that works, you spent $200 million getting here, and you've got 10 years before your patent runs out. Finance runs the numbers and tells you what to sell it for. And then you hope you make enough money to get everything you spent back and a little profit to pay everyone's salaries. And then you do it again. Sometimes you get lucky and find an amazing drug that makes ridiculous amounts of profit (Viagra comes to mind), and sometimes you never find something that works and just have to write off that $200 million. The next drug has to recoup that cost or you'll be going bankrupt soon.
Meanwhile, some dude in Malaysia takes your drug and copies it, and throws it on the dark net market for cheap (he doesn't have $200 million to recoup; it's pure profit for him). And here we are.

None of these statements make any sense (or are just meaningless):








2-4% less each year. That's 20ish cents if you're making minimum wage. Every few years minimum wage is bumped up a dollar. Not sure what the problem is here.


And with Bitcoin, this doesn't happen because.... what? Bitcoin companies are your friend?


And with Bitcoin, we won't have to worry about money or income anymore? We'll just lounge around all day, work when we want, drink beers with our boss, and get paid ludicrous wages to Reddit all day? Ok.


Bitcoin negates the need for loans? Or is this more diatribe about fiat being debt-based?


Because why? Because you said so? No filthy bankers allowed in Bitcoin? Only scammy exchanges that steal your money all at once instead of slowly bleeding you through, what was it, "performing a three cup shuffle trick"?


Step aside democracy; Bitcoin is here to free us from oppression.


I googled "freedom of financial expression" expecting some links to some international resolutions about basic freedoms, but I only found links talking about Bitcoin.

Nobody said there weren't consequences. Some *actual economists* just decided this was a much better system than a deflationary currency "built on math" with a finite amount of currency and that wastes energy like there's no tomorrow.
There's a reason that things work the way they do, and it isn't just manipulation. If it was manipulation, why aren't the economics professors at every university buying up all the Bitcoin?

@_date: 2015-04-07 22:34:17
The math does not take into account the size of the Bitcoin economy. There are more than enough coins to let all the drug transactions and sales of alpaca socks happen smoothly. One of the main reasons the price keeps wanting to drop is more and more coins are being forced into the market without a corresponding demand for them (which would appear if more people wanted to conduct trade in Bitcoin). It's simple supply and demand.
The Federal Reserve on the other hand can gauge the growth of the economy and print money as necessary to target a certain inflation amount.
The problem is we're using two different definitions of inflation. The rate of currency introduced into the system is just a mathematical formula; it's not very relevant to anyone day-to-day. *Price inflation* is what's important. Bitcoin's surge of supply with no corresponding increase in demand creates rampant price inflation.

Banks are a business. Businesses should be free to close unprofitable ventures, which may include your bank account.
If you don't think banks should be allowed to make money through normal means, then you're going to have to directly pay for a bank account to make it definitively profitable, or pay higher taxes to fund a national bank that will give anyone a bank account.


Yeah, it's called storing your money under your mattress. Highly susceptible to theft. Your internet tokens just digitized the concept without fixing the "highly susceptible to theft" problem.

The fact that you can post on a public forum complaining about living in a police state is pretty good evidence that you don't live in a police state. Please stop pretending you are living in a police state when you actually live in one of the most developed, first-world countries with the freedom to say pretty much whatever you want.
You're claiming your current situation is comparable to living in the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, South African Apartheid, Pinochet's Chile, Cuba's dictatorships, or North Korea. This is just disrespectful to those who actually endured those police states.

The vast majority of Bitcoin thieves so far seem to be scammy companies that Bitcoiners unwittingly trust to hold their money. That and downloading viruses, payment interception, etc. that steal their coins. Most average humans are pretty shitty at being a bank. A bank has security specialists, secured servers, and most importantly insurance. Your average human has what they read on a few forums and does their general computing and web browsing on the same device they store their coins on, with no insurance or backup in case of theft. It's a recipe for disaster.

I don't think the act of being homeless was ever illegal or a problem here. It was alleged violations of county codes that have to do with zoning and sanitation. You can't usually turn your residential property into a commercial campground without getting permission from the government. Otherwise you have tens or hundreds of people living in squalid conditions next to other residential property. Can drag down property value or have other negative effects which are valid concerns (just like if someone wanted to open a factory in the middle of a suburb). Also, enforcing health and sanitation codes usually benefits everyone.

When a person defaults, they aren't either. Debtors' prisons don't exist anymore. If you absolutely can't pay your debts, your creditors are out of luck. Nobody is going to want to loan you money anymore, but you are still free to live your life. If you do something malicious or don't pay your taxes, yes that is a crime and you may go to jail.
I'm not impinging on your right to talk finances here. You can talk about the various ways to define inflation or fiscal policy or what's wrong or what's right all you want. Go nuts. But you have to realize that little of that matters outside of Federal reserve boardrooms and economics departments. To consumers and merchants a successful currency is something they can conduct trade with. USD does that; Bitcoin doesn't at this point in time. 
You're not going to win people over to your currency by talking about fiscal policy and what *might* happen to the US dollar some day. Sure, some of the aspects of Bitcoin are good, but it has several big cons that make it unsuitable for conducting trade. It's just not attractive. What we have and use everyday works. There's no reason to switch unless the new thing is better in almost every way. With something like Bitcoin, most of its "advantages" aren't really advantages because most consumers and merchants aren't libertarians or paranoid about the dollar collapsing or the bank stealing their money. Bitcoin is a solution to a problem that most people don't have. It's a cool idea but is destined to be a niche product.

You do realize Bitcoin has been inflating tens of times worse than any real major currency? A 77% loss in purchasing power in a year and a half is "worthless money" to most people. Your $60,000 salary is only worth $13,500 now. That's basically worthless.

It's easier to trust a bank to secure your money (and not run off with it) than to trust yourself to safely secure them.
In that sense, Bitcoin requires too much trust and too much work. The threat of a bank stealing your money is incredibly low if you are just a boring average person (like 99.99% of everyone). The threat of you losing your money to a virus is much, much higher for 99.99% of everyone.
People may not see the innovation, but they do see the negatives, and they far outweigh any possible pros.

Presumably, the unlicensed business does harm to society. Much like a food company with disregard for what ends up in the food can probably offer much lower prices than ones that spend money ensuring proper quality and safety. That's going to end up killing someone. You probably don't think the government should step aside and let the consumer choose whether to buy the expensive but safe option or the cheap but unsafe option, right?
I can see money-exchanging as having a high propensity for scamming, money laundering, and other problems which is why licensing is required.
As for making *every* business that accepts Bitcoin be licensed, that's a different call. I'd probably disagree with that, but the regulators are free to do what they want. If society disagrees then campaign for better regulation.

I understand it's not analogous to physical theft. Piracy just has no end game.
You say you're an artist? Yet you agree with piracy. Let's say I make a blockbuster movie that costs $200 million to make. If piracy is legal, I am entitled to zero dollars. Everyone can just copy the copy that took $200 million to make. Tell me again why I should outlay $200 million to make this movie?
Furthermore, other people are allowed to sell it for money? I spent $200 million making this movie, but some random dude who finds a copy of it can start selling it for $5. He's making pure profit because someone else paid $200 million to make that movie.
Same thing with music, and video games and books and any other digital work. If I spend 2,000 hours of my life making a video game, and sell it online for $10, someone else can just download it, re-upload it on their own much more popular site, and give it away for free (or sell it themselves, or pretend they made it themselves since clearly ownership means nothing now). Yay, I made like $10.
Intellectual property exists for a reason. If everyone pirated, nobody would make any money on digital creations, and nobody would make them for a living. Only the wealthy and hobbyists would have time to things for themselves. Say goodbye to blockbuster movies, triple-A games, and most music.

Oh... your currency lost half of its purchasing power in the last year? You should check out this one. *Everyone's* using it. See, the idea is the government keeps the inflation rate slow and steady, so you have consistent purchasing power day-to-day. Also, you don't have to secure your money yourself. A bank will let you set up a free account, insured by the government, and stores your money for you. Now you don't have to worry about theft.

And Bitcoin is not the only solution. The US is still a powerful nation whether or not it defaults on its loans or whether it bails out the banks or not. The economy may falter, but that doesn't mean it's the end times. There are plenty of smart economists who can come up with USD 2.0, backed by a future version of our government that remedies whatever problems there are. The details don't really matter as long as the vast majority of citizens are *relatively* happy and able to live comfortable lives.
Bitcoin just swaps the rich class around. Instead of the current set of bankers and investors, it's Bitcoin early adopters and Chinese miners. That doesn't improve anything besides fulfilling your fantasies. It also has a questionable economic basis, with set deflation and a printing algorithm that can't adjust to economic growth (these economic theories are fringe for a reason).

I'm sure it does matter to some guys with PhDs in economics tasked with sorting those kinds of things out. I'm sure they'll find a reasonable solution. Your average consumer or merchant though, could not give less of a shit. Unless you can point to some effect that is the result of this "default" that actually affected consumers, then no it really doesn't matter.

The alternative is company trade secrets. Patents (eventually) free information for public use. They motivate this distribution, by giving the filer a small period of exclusivity. 
We will never know the exact recipe of Coke soda, because Coke never patented it. They have an effective monopoly on it for the end of time. Cutting edge airplane technology is kept as a trade secret instead of patenting because it lasts longer that way.
You can find pretty much every invention known to man in the patent archives, with exact specifications of how they work and are built. It's a treasure trove of public material that would otherwise be hidden away in company archives unless you were able to get a copy of the product and were smart enough to take it apart and figure out how it worked. All you give up in return is a decade or two for the inventor to earn some income for his hard work.
Also, Coinbase just applied for the patents. They haven't been granted yet. And who says they will be granted? Oh yeah, you, because you are looking for every excuse to hate the current system.
Please, go invent something, don't file a patent, and watch while a big company reverse engineers your invention and puts the same product on the shelf for half of the price in less than a month (economics of scale). The patent system isn't broken. Copyright is.

So? The U.S. isn't the only government. There's like 20 top tier living environments in Europe and around the world. Even so, the US does offer the best educations if one is to take advantage of them, and the US public education, while not the best, is not a failure either. More successful than any anarchist attempt anyway.


Har, har, har. Yes I know how much you hate the government from behind your keyboard in a country with a government.
Every attempt at anarchy failed. There's a reason for that. It sucks. People just want to form a government again. Before such things as nations existed, people lived in tribes and fought with each other. How do you not understand that governments make life better? If free markets were so great, presumably *that* would be what a decent number of populations operate under, yet I see 200 mostly successful governments around the world that people are relatively okay with living under. There's a reason you guys make up less than 0.01% of the population. You can dream all you want about some utopia. I'd love to live in a perfectly socialist state, but I'm not so naive to think that it could ever achieve that; it usually becomes unfair pretty quickly like in every attempt at socialism ever.

Glad we agree on something.


Yes, anything that crashes 15% in 48 hours, or 60% in a year, or 80% in two years is clearly a "decent store of value."


Yet the vast majority of people who hear about Bitcoin don't end up using it. You guys still have only like 100,000 users. Is the human race really that prejudiced and blind to Bitcoin's advantages, or are *you guys* the blinded ones, unable to see Bitcoin's major faults?

You mean the lendee? I guess stocks would work, but you're gambling on their future price. It's much easier to use something of constant value, like a valuable item that is enough to cover the entire loan, or just provide your identity so the lender can track you down when you don't pay, and maybe some proof that your not destitute, like a recent pay stub or credit score.
You know... exactly how it works right now.

Those fees aren't immediately evident to the consumer (which is kind of a big deal) and when paying with Bitcoin, it's the same price so you're not really gaining anything.


Again, this is instantaneous for the consumer which is what really matters.


This just screams SCAM to consumers. Why wouldn't you give them the ability to chargeback if they are unsatisfied with the service? Any real business does not have a problem with fraudulent chargebacks; it's built into the business model just like shoplifting. If your business has a problem with chargebacks you're either selling illegal things or doing something fraudulent yourself (which is why credit cards pull their services from you).


Again, not relevant to consumers. And this is why things like PayPal exist, which act as a liaison between the buyer and seller and ensure smooth payment and delivery.
You don't seem to get it: **Consumers** drive the market. If your business doesn't offer the payment methods or ability to chargeback that consumers want, they will just shop elsewhere. If you're offering *steep* discounts (20% maybe, not a measly 5%) they might be persuaded, but there's no way to work that into an actual business model and it still screams SCAM. I can just open a competing business that accepts credit cards and make 10 times the profit you do.

Or instead of calculating probabilities or dealing with insurance I could use a credit card and have a 0% chance of being scammed? Credit cards give 3% rewards (sometimes more) anyway. Unless Overstock is throwing around 10% discounts or something it doesn't make sense, especially when exchange fees are 1% to even obtain Bitcoin to spend, and only 0.22% of their sales are Bitcoin. Even then, it's only a 5% discount now, and that's probably not worth figuring out the arcane ways to use and secure internet tokens. People just want something that works, not demand they have a relatively high level knowledge of digital security.
Credit cards make things idiot-proof. That's why consumers love them; you can be the most retarded person with regards to your security and shopping habits, buying on the sketchiest websites, and your credit card has your back. Using Bitcoin will just get you scammed, unless you critically evaluate everywhere you spend it, which is already too much work.
@_date: 2015-04-11 21:19:27
Customer A pays more because the bank gave them 20 times more money and won't get it back for a much longer time period than the money loaned to Customer B. It's not just the amount of work or time that matters, but the opportunity cost of loaning that money, which could have been invested elsewhere. This is economics 101.
Also, I'm not sure what this has to do with Bitcoin. In a deflationary internet token economy, you'd be worse off trying to obtain a loan, because the natural gain in purchasing power from just doing nothing with your money requires higher interest rates to make a profit loaning it out. The only other alternative is saving for 40 years to buy a house. I'm not sure how either of those things is an improvement.
Oh, and if you do manage to get a loan it becomes harder and harder to pay it back, because as purchasing power increases, your salary will *decrease* while the numbers in the loan you signed won't change. If you have a 20 Bitcoin loan payment every month, that will become a larger and larger percent of your income.

That's funny, because over the last one and a half years the free market took 75% of your wealth. It turns out intangible things can take your intangible wealth.

The prevalence of simple hacks and social engineering leading to the theft of Bitcoins makes that statement highly inaccurate. Also, you are shit out of luck when your Bitcoins are stolen. Money stored in banks and valuables in safe deposit boxes or even in your own safe can all be insured, and the risk is basically zero. If the shit hits the fan in any way that leaves your wealth inaccessible, your Bitcoin will be just as useless.

Such a great currency right?
So you remember when Bitcoin was a $1 (let's say a Bitcoin can buy a loaf of bread)? Your salary is 50,000 Bitcoin/year and let's say you borrowed 70,000 Bitcoin to buy a house. The monthly payment is 500 Bitcoins. 5 years later (through the magic of a deflationary economy or something) a Bitcoin is worth $200 (or buys 200 loaves of bread). Your salary has of course been adjusted down to 250 Bitcoins/year, because you still provide only the same worth to your company. Yet the terms of your loan haven't changed; you don't make enough in a year to make even the monthly payment.
Under the same argument there's no reason to ever give anyone a loan. Currency gains value naturally; no point in risking it loaning it to others for profit. The economy will stagnant as businesses can't get loans or investments, you won't be able to get a loan for a house or car *or* it will be at much higher interest rates than you see now.

Yep, because neither of those things would happen if you didn't pay taxes. Potatoes would probably cost $7 each, and roving gangs would murder you and steal everything you own. But hey, at least no one coerced you into paying a "theft bill."

I was talking about the [FDIC]( created in 1933.


There are lots of examples of free markets that hurt consumers more than their now regulated markets. You want specifically banking ones? That's the one I just listed, remedied by the FDIC.
Also, markets are still considered free in the US, regulation is not some huge burden, as you can see by the *mostly* successful US economy. Sure, some companies switched to production in third-world countries, but you can see how that only harms people in those countries, with China pumping out smog and coal fumes, and people working for pennies across East Asia. That's what the lack of an EPA and minimum wage regulation does.

No, a decent bank only has fees for when you yourself fuck up, like overdrawing your account. I'm actually at a credit union, which is even better. There is no shortage of banks. If yours has unreasonable fees, use a different one.


Not on personal checking and savings accounts, that's for sure. Banks make money interacting with businesses who have accounts in the thousands of dollars, by reinvesting that money in loans or stocks or whatever.
Personal checking and savings accounts exist so when you need a loan for a car, house, or your new business idea, they're the first place you go (it's a [loss leader]( basically). Banks make a nice chunk of change off those.

You're trying to create something in Bitcoin that already exists in modern banking systems, minus all the protections the modern system has. Eventually you'll realize those are kind of a good thing.


You can never take them to court.


A fair point, but they can still not provide the service and you can't get your money back.


Netflix itself probably won't do that. But prepare for a slew of new companies promising "streamining services at $6.99 a month," "... $5.99 a month," "...$1.99 a month," etc. all with varying levels of illegality, pirating, and scamming. Every market becomes cluttered with crap and "good deals" that could just be scams. Where do you send your Bitcoin? Netflix could easily use its already trusted reputation to raise their fee higher because that's where people know they will actually get genuine service. Now you're paying more.
Now expand that to every single market. When you have an irreversible payment method, you have a petri dish for scams. All you have to do is get them to trust you enough to send that first bit. With credit cards, it's not so easy to scam people. You don't need to look any further than to see how problematic the scams are.
How do you try out new companies? What if Netflix (or some other company) legitimately just isn't working for you, or never shipped your product? And they refuse to refund you? They *insist* they sent the $200 TV and every other customer happily received theirs. Maybe it did get lost in the mail, but the company refuses to refund you. Are you just out $200?
Don't even get me started on peer-to-peer online trading a la eBay, and Bitcoin's escrow ideas which just reinvent existing systems in a more broken apart, corruptible, and expensive way.
Remember, [you can screw over every 30th customer and still have 97% positive feedback]( If you have hundreds or thousands of customers, you can have arbitrarily high customer feedback (99.9%) and still leave some people high and dry without their money or service they paid for. Or, do legit business for awhile, building up your reputation, then scam everyone at once, open up as a new shop, and do it again. Pretty sure this is how Bitcoin exchanges, online drug marketplaces, and the vendors in those places basically operate.

Probably because that's a monumentally stupid way to pay for a used car. You're just asking to get mugged. Banks have these things called  [cashier's checks]( which are basically made specifically for this purpose.
Also, probably not wise to keep $6000 in teller drawers (especially if this is a smaller branch bank). Unless you want to clean out every single teller's drawer to withdraw your money, it'd be nice to give them a heads up so they can pull it out of the safe.

The morality or practicality of a law has little to do with whether you forfeit illegal profits or not. When all of us pay 10% of our income to the government, you should be pretty mad when someone is rolling in untaxed millions. The "hard work" of Silk Road got at least a couple of people killed via drug overdoses, and connected hundreds more with computer hacking software, credit card numbers and theft software, fake driver's licenses, passports, unlicensed guns, and cyanide at one point I believe. You can claim that that's not Silk Road's fault, but the vast majority of society disagrees.

The thing is.... 99% of the population is actually kind of okay with that law. Only crackpot anarchists think "you're a victim of an unjust system" and so you're delusional if you think 99% of people are going to suddenly switch to Bitcoin and start protesting government injustice. Nobody cares that Ulbricht went to jail, he was running a multi-million dollar drug empire connecting people with every drug known to man, and dozens of other illegal goods, and skimmed millions of untaxed dollars in profit off the top. 99% of people have no problem with him being in jail.

We need better lobbyists on our side, and the commission/Congressmen that make these laws needs to tell Disney to fuck off. We live in a capitalist society, and businesses/rich people will always have more leverage. We just need better legislators that can see all of the effects of copyright law, and not just the ones Disney tells them (which requires us to educate them).


Copyright is useful, and I think there is a period of time we can all agree on. Something like "life of the author or 50 years, whichever is more" would work, or if the rights are sold to a corporate entity, then 50 years. The creator can live off of the fruits of their labor (or if they die prematurely, their descendants can) and works pass into the public domain relatively quickly.
It's much better than "life of the author plus 70 years" like it is now, anyway.

Government regulation is the only thing that makes companies do what's good for society and not what's good for the bottom line.

We're having this discussion in two different places.


You neglect to explain how. If a business is still licensed I know they haven't scammed their entire customer base before, and I can look at their past performance. I also know the government has the information of the owners of the company, so if something does go wrong, there is someone accountable for it.
And licenses do ensure competence. You need an engineering degree to be a Public Engineer. You need a medical degree to be licensed to practice medicine. You need a law degree to practice law, etc. Financial businesses have to report finances and taxes to the government to ensure they aren't insolvent or doing shady things with customers' money, laundering money, etc. Shareholders and investors would also like to know what exactly the business is doing, and a license/regulation requires them to divulge that information.
It also just smooths over the process of taxation and regulation. It tells the government (and society) "Hey, I'm a business, I'm paying my taxes, and doing everything by the book."

Regardless of how "better" he made the world, he still profited off of the trafficking of illegal drugs, and *society* believes (which is all that matters) that anyone trafficking illegal drugs that can lead to overdose and death is culpable for those deaths. They are considered inherently dangerous, just like a broken amusement park ride, and knowing that it is broken/dangerous while letting people use it is a crime. Another more contentious example is stealing a stop sign, which later causes a fatal car crash. Is the thief guilty of manslaughter, or just petty theft? Shouldn't an adult human being understand the obvious consequences of their actions?
Why do we consider cocaine and meth to be inherently dangerous, and not alcohol or aspirin? That's just the way society chose it to be; the former are considered net negatives to the community and the latter are net positives (despite however much you may disagree).

Seriously dude, you just sound like a whiny teenager. Writing an essay can teach you a variety of useful things: how to collect sources, how to select quotes, how to prove a thesis using supporting facts and quotes, how to fluently express your ideas, or anything really. You can write an essay on pretty much anything and for any purpose: to cover the history of something, to draw conclusions from source material, to tell a story from your life, to relate to something else, or just to opine on some philosophical topic.
Sure, grading essays will always be more subjective than grading math problems, but there are clear differences between a bad essay and a good essay, and learning how to write a good essay is an important skill. Lots of jobs (like those STEM ones Reddit so loves) require you to write documents where you have to support your conclusions with facts. I'm only in college and I'm writing a 1000-word lab report every week for my engineering lab. That's essentially essay writing, and that's why you learn how to write essays.

That's if you didn't mess up at some point during that setup and made yourself vulnerable enough to have all of your coins stolen. Tough luck, mate; at least those greedy banks never got your money.

That's not the point. The point is that guerrilla warfare can be highly effective when conducted on your own land amid local populations that are willing to support or at least tolerate your rebellion. The superior military force will always have a difficult time routing you, especially if it doesn't want to hurt innocents in the process, because there's no clean engagements where raw strength matters. Fights are conducted in the shadows, and insurgents can slip out of and back into the local populace (who are usually helping them) without a trace. Can be quite frustrating.

I'd say it's only morally defensible if there is zero access to it in your country. Like no way at all to pay for it. If the owner decides to sell his product only via credit cards then you're just going to have to deal with not having the product. *That's how capitalism works*. If you don't like the price of an item, *you don't get to have the item*. You can argue about how making a copy doesn't cost the owner anything, but you're really just making up justifications to make it sound good in your head. Clearly, we cannot all make copies or the owner would make no money. You're just shifting the burden to paying consumers; you get to benefit from the product, while the rest of us pay for the benefit. Not exactly fair.
To phrase it another way, the product would never have been made if the owner knew everyone was just going to not pay for it. There is an inherent disadvantage in making a product that can be copied. The owner only gains an advantage when a consumer bothers to pay for it (and the consumer also benefits from the product). When you don't pay for it, the owner is disadvantaged, because he doesn't get a return on his investment costs (which he clearly deserves) even though you get a benefit from the product.
@_date: 2015-10-06 17:41:54

For better or worse, the government plays a larger role in our lives nowadays than it did 250 years ago.

* Videos will quickly end up being pirated (especially if you let users download them), so quantity of micropayments will tend to zero over time
* The porn industry probably has people whose job it is to figure out how to make the most money (like every other industry). Micropayments aren't prevalent for a reason, and integrating a payment system that has less than 100,000 users isn't going to change that.

Is your currency really going to be deflationary enough to where if I wanted to say purchase a house, I wouldn't have to save up for 40 years? Because any currency *that* deflationary cannot have an economy built on it.
So, no, it doesn't work. Banks and loans are an important part of any economy. People need loans to make big purchases (like a house or a car) without saving their money up for decades. Why should I have to wait a decade to buy a house or car, when I can buy one now and pay it off while using it?


No, you invest it in something that is practically guaranteed to beat inflation (and more) over a long time period, because you're usually saving for retirement. Bank savings are used to store money that will be spent relatively quickly (like a checking account) or for a small emergency fund when you need some money in a hurry (like a savings account). The effects of inflation are negligible on such a small amount of money.


No, you invest it; you don't spend it.


How much is your currency deflating? How much profit is my mattress making? $1 a month? $100 a month? $1,000 a month? You can't build an economy on a currency that fluctuates in value that much.


And thus investments cease to exist, and no innovation happens. Everyone just hoards their money, because hey, I make more money doing that then taking a risk on this investment.


What, from the $1/month I'm accruing? Or is it some larger number that makes any economy infeasible?


Again, you won't see this effect unless the deflation is some big number that makes economies impossible.


Yeah, clearly every economist who agrees that inflation can be good is an idiot and a fraud. OP, however, has thought about this a lot from his armchair and watched a few YouTube videos, so you should probably just take his word for it that deflationary economies are the solution to all of our problems.

Of course this would never be offered, because it's stupid. Credit cards and banks are marketing to *consumers*. Consumers like things that protect them.

That is correct, because most home invasions by individual citizens do not have a judge's signature that affirms sufficient evidence has been obtained to warrant a search. The government on the other hand, usually *does* have a search warrant.
But yeah, keep ranting about how the government has different rights than individual citizens. That's kind of the point.

That's nowhere near accurate. A good chunk of those people burned out over the past year or two, because it turns out a tanking price means your internet tokens suck. Plus people get new accounts, have throwaways, and lots of other stuff. Probably 3/4 of those subscribers aren't even active.

That's just a minor improvement on swiping your credit card or debit card, which is ubiquitous throughout the US. Debit cards just also require a 4-digit PIN, which you can argue makes it more secure. Same speed, really.

Let's say you're tinkering in your garage and invent something. You think it's marketable so you start looking for investors to fund production. Some large corporation gets wind of your idea, thinks it's good and makes it themselves. You make $0 from your successful invention. *That* is unfair wealth distribution.
See why patents exist? It allows inventors to have a grace period to profit from their inventions without people stealing their idea. So they can actually afford to invent stuff.
Intellectual property is property just as much as any physical property. Nobody says it has to be your property forever (patents only last 10 years or so, and I think the copyright terms need to be reduced a good bit), but if you can't recognize that ideas and artistic creations have value, then you've just never made anything creative in your life that was worth anything.

The Bitcoin price works the same way. was right more than any Bitcoiner on this sub, especially over the past year.

An invention's worth shouldn't be based on how complex it is. A lightbulb is not a complex invention. Anyone can take a lightbulb apart and see how it works. That doesn't mean a huge amount of effort didn't go into inventing it. If you slaved away for a decade perfecting the invention of one, I think that's worth something. Say you get your product to market. You started your own business to sell it. Some large corporation takes your product, reverse-engineers it to see how it works and is made, and is able to make exact duplicates and sell them at a much cheaper price, out-competing you before you've made any money.
I know you think it'd be nice to live in a world where everyone shares all information and we all just invent stuff, and make movies and video games, and write books and songs out of the kindness of our hearts to be shared with everyone for free. That's not the world we live in, because things like food cost money, and sharing all of your creative outputs for free does not give you money. No one can afford to be creative unless you allow them the exclusive right to sell their creations (for a limited time).
Edit: Also, you might note that patents *do* benefit the community. The exclusive period only lasts a few years. Patents are public record, and after the term is up anyone can duplicate them. They create an incentive to actually bother to invent anything in the first place.

Have you considered that the reduced block reward means a significant chunk of miners can no longer mine profitably, which means the network starts reducing in size? Either transaction numbers need to increase a lot, or transaction fees need to go up a lot (OH NOES, guess we have fees now?) or after a few halvings your Bitcoins will be worthless.
Turns out that hoarding your internet tokens (isn't that the epitome of the decentralized currency you guys so cherish?) is kind of bad for your internet tokens.

Okay, whatever. You sure love to see "cracks" forming in the currency considered the safest investment in the world, but you can't admit that your internet token's might have a hyperinflation problem, can't build an economy around itself at all, and are exhibit A in why deflationary currencies don't work.

Except for the fact that 6 years after its inception Facebook had 400 million users and was the largest social networking site on the internet.

Nobody really has a use case for Bitcoin, so all it has done is flounder.

Yes, just look at all the successful anarchic societies out there. It's a wonder anyone chooses to live under a government; it's not like the only reason you're able to spend your time browsing internet forums instead of, I don't know, protecting your possessions and land from roving gangs is because a government exists. Keep on dreaming.
Also, some free advice: Your internet tokens are never going to go mainstream until this community drops the anarchy/dollar is going to collapse tomorrow crackpot theories. Anybody with any modicum of intelligence knows that peaceful anarchy is a pipe dream. Your internet tokens probably still won't go mainstream, but it should significantly increase your chances.

In other news, the actual *price inflation* that actually matters is all over the fucking chart, 15% inflation in *one night*, 10% deflation the next day, etc. Pretty crappy currency, when first-world fiat currencies manage to target like 3% inflation *a year*, which makes for a much more usable form of trade.

Your friend: Hey look guys, sent me internet tokens for my birthday. Thanks dude, not sure what to do with those besides trade them back in for US dollars which takes time and costs money so I can actually buy something. I guess for your birthday I'll get you some Deutschmarks so we can both give each other similarly obscure and useless gifts.
Fun Fact: Current trade done in Deutschmarks (which has been defunct since 2002) is still magnitudes larger than Bitcoin trade. How cool is that?

Well, Bitcoin didn't even get a moment; it's not a safe store of value at all really. So I don't know, if the USD crashes we'll just use a new government-issued currency, life will go on, and Bitcoin will continue to be volatile as it descends into obscurity.
@_date: 2015-02-20 04:38:46
Saying that doesn't make it so. The prices of goods denominated in Bitcoin went up 80% last year. That's not deflationary. If you trade all of your Bitcoin you bought last year for USD now you'll get a lot less back than you paid for it. That's not deflationary.
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:35:05
None of that matters though. The important question is "How many loaves of bread does this salary in this currency buy me?" and how that changes across days, months, and years.
Now compare fiat and Bitcoin and see which one's better. The sooner you realize that 99% of people don't care whether fiat is printed, or that your "currency" is "backed by math", and just want to conduct trade in a stable manner (read: be able to feed their family on the same paycheck every week), the sooner you'll realize that fiat has strong advantages over Bitcoin.

Wow, that is a pretty complicated fantasy.


And who enforces these laws? Some type of armed force? So now we have armed forces running around on contracts to apprehend supposed wrongdoers? Then what? They're tried in a kangaroo court? Brought back to you?


Oh, kind of like how 99% of our nation is perfectly okay with what we have now. Congratulations you've formed a government. Or in your fantasy land, competing governments. People will just not leave the area that their "subscription" is willing to protect them in, and congratulations, you've formed individual nation states.


We choose representatives to make our laws. We choose someone to be the head of the branch that enforces those laws. Sure it may not give you the citizen that much individual power, but unless *you* want to spend all day arguing about laws or dealing with other people who don't like your laws and break them, you'd be wise to let someone who *wants* to do that do it and represent your interests. Letting someone represent us in government lets us pursue other things in life.


Oh like a government? Or are your armed "subscription" services just going to duke it out and when the dust settles whoever's still standing "owns" the property.
Come on dude, you're just rolling the clock back 900 years on civilization. You've reinvented feudal states, shoved computers and the blockchain into like that's supposed to fix all our problems and think it's somehow going to prevent human nature from running its course. Look at every anarchic society in history or the worst third-world hellholes that are basically anarchy and exist today. The wealthy, powerful, and armed take what they want; the common poor just try to get by. Your computers and "subscriptions" be damned.

So far Bitcoin has done a wicked job of being "deflationary." It really only seems to want to inflate. But keep telling yourself it's better than USD. Until every single penny of yours is traded in for Bitcoin and all of your savings are in Bitcoin, I really can't take you seriously. So what are you waiting for? Does that 80% drop in price in a year scare you? 
@_date: 2015-10-16 19:03:10
That's the argument, that decentralization isn't worth the expended energy. Bitcoin's current transaction throughput could be handled by a single server in somebody's basement. All we have to do is trust that guy.
The people making these posts think it is more economically feasible to just trust someone. That could be a bank that has to follow government regulations (this works pretty well in the first world for the vast majority of consumers). Bitcoiners think you can't trust anyone.
So decentralization is valued differently. If you don't see much value in it, then you will obviously see the large amount of energy expended as wasteful. It's just a difference of opinion.

I think that's called credit card fraud. What you're probably trying to say is "my Bitcoin wallet sells my Bitcoin, then sends fiat to the credit card company, who confirms the transaction." I don't think this is going to be done for free though, which necessitates a fee, on top of the fee you paid to buy Bitcoins, which means you're already down 2-3% when you factor in the rewards I got from paying with an actual credit card. And we haven't even included the likely price inflation that has occurred while you held those Bitcoins since it can't even keep its own price stable.
This begs the question of why Bitcoin is involved in the first place. If you remove Bitcoin from your list of bullet points, you actually get a functional system that is used by millions of people everyday. Let's do that instead.

That's kind of how capitalism works. Businesses compete for consumer's business. You have to make your offer attractive to consumers. Forcing consumers to take on the risk of securing their own money and not fucking up a transaction is not exactly appealing. That's why Bitcoin's user adoption suffers. The vast majority of the world doesn't buy into the ideological quackery that this sub continuously spouts off, and the rest of Bitcoin's "advantages" aren't exactly better than existing payment methods for the consumer. Which is all that matters.

Key phrase:
