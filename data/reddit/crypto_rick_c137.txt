You attacked a dude for not having “facts”, when in fact, his experience obviously trumps your own. Eat a dick dude.

dash is a scam coin im pretty sure, at least I thought that was the general consensus. They push it on poor countries.

Yes, just some website, but it has compiled a lot of information that can be verified individually. But it is likely that the guy who said 5,000 has family from China, which itself requires a permit for any amount over $5,000.
Gotcha bitch. 
edit: supporting website

You, sir, are dense. I already made my point, that every single country has different laws. That Chinese people, immigrating to the United States, can only bring 5,000 USD before needing a permit from the Chinese Government to bring more. 
You obviously don’t deal with this daily. 
And the dude said 16-20 family members. Not an Uncle 7 years ago. People like you, especially if you actually are in law enforcement (which I doubt you are), are the problem with America. You use a straw man argument and you sound like an idiot. Look it up and try to be a little more righteous in your life, instead of a crabby ol’ little bitch.

I would say Monero is a better choice. No one can randomly access your information and see the amount you have and the transactions you have made, like in Bitcoin. 
But you would be fine regardless, but I would stick that ledger somewhere safe and of course have a backup of your keys somewhere. They won’t be able to access your funds unless they know your ledger password, and then you can just buy a new ledger and import your various keys.
