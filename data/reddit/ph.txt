not really. its called perseverance, and is a trait that is attributed to success.

But when the checks get made out to the same entity its still a conflict of interest.

What's this final hash all about?

i will opposite your opposite...      
large fortune 500 hundred companies with  marketing and public relations departments have a decent presence because they have the man power to put towards that and they think it makes a difference (to most, it doesnt - to the vocal few it does).
many small-niche businesses have them as well because they are staffed by a tiny few who are heavily invested in the success, e.g. the owners, who will do anything to get the smallest amount of business to gain traction (flavor of the month food truck telling you where they will be, latest fashion boutique letting you know where the next trunk show is, etc).            
then there is the lions share of established businesses that land just above struggling small business where the sweat and tears have paid off, but not enough to afford a dedicated mar-comm staff that would manage the social media presence. they spend their time serving the customer and the social media becomes something that maybe gets updated quarterly if they think about it at all.
tl;dr - presence or lack of social media can not be used as a true indicator of a businesses viability or trustworthiness (although an exception could be an overwhelming negative presence).
