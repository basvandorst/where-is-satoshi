Yeah, according the timestamps, it took Satoshi about 7719 minutes to mine block 1, time which could have been spent mining another 772 blocks or so.
Nobody really knows why Satoshi spent so much time mining the first block, but maybe he hadn't measured his hardware's hashrate and didn't calibrate the difficulty properly. It's also possible that the genesis block's timestamp was fudged.
Actually, several blocks early in the chain took more than a day to mine. For example, block 15 took about 1453 minutes.

I'm guessing 473,354 was calculated [assuming 1 year = 365.2425 days on average](
To be more precise:
9 years * 365 days = 4,730,400 minutes
2012 and 2016 were leap years, which adds 2 days = 2,880 minutes
Thus, in total there should have been about 473,328 blocks in the last 9 years.
The block mined closest to 9 years after the timestamp of the genesis block (2009-01-03 18:15:05) was 502,400 (2018-01-03 18:14:02).
So we are actually 29,072 blocks ahead.
The average block time has been about 9 minutes and 25 seconds.

The average block time has been about 9 minutes 25 seconds. About 4% of blocks have taken longer than 30 minutes. This is [about what you'd expect from an exponential distribution on block times](

I don't understand what makes this "spam." One of the largest exchanges disables sends, and the mempool temporarily clears up slightly? Seems hardly surprising. What is the evidence that Segwit and batching would even fix this?
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:54:35
Segwit and batching will help, definitely... but how do we know that after implementing these things, we wouldn't see exactly the same pattern in the mempool if Coinbase disabled sending?

I am mining Musicoin with a GTX 690 and it has been making about $40/month. That could change very soon, though.

No. But O the mark of the beast! Signal of the beginning apocalypse!

A Bitcoin addresses can't be replaced with a username because it is the public key cryptographically paired with your private key. However, something like DNS could be created for Bitcoin addresses, as it is already done for IP addresses. Like DNS, this would likely entail the use of centralized name servers.

anyone else have a serious problem with missing data in the GDAX price charts?

I don't think they would sell stolen BTC on an exchange where you have to verify your identity.
