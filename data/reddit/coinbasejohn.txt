Sorry for the trouble. 
I tested and was able to get this to work for me, though that doesn't mean you're not having an issue for whatever reason.

Realizing you'd prefer not to use Coinbase, our [buy widget]( is available through a few 3rd party apps and sites, to enable their users to buy small amounts of bitcoin (up to $5). It's pretty new, so the only payment method currently support is a debit card.
The easiest way to find the widget would likely be through an account at popchest.com.

Good question.
We ask many customers to verify a government identification in order to comply with government and regulatory requirements, as well as to mitigate risk. Depending on which payment methods you're using, we might ask for this up front, or after a certain amount of activity. 
[This article]( provides more information which you might find helpful:

We're continuing to roll out debit cards, as of this week it's available to 25% of US customers. The last 75% will likely move more quickly  than the first 25%, but I don't think there's a specific timeline for it.

OP is talking about buying bitcoins, which is a US wide feature, soon to be available to all US customers. 
When you say "locations", I think what you are referring to is the Shift card for spending BTC. Available states are listed here: 
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:51:36
The vault is really intended for long term holding. Though it would be technically possible to convert the funds to fiat and just add an extra two day delay on the withdrawal, our expectation is that vault users don't need quick access to the funds in the vault, and it's not something we've had a lot of requests for AFAIK.

We didn't do a great job of clarifying this, but it's being "rolled out" gradually. I think we're currently at 25%. We'll be at 100% as soon as we can.

Just from the description (which is very clear, thank you), it sounds like you have an open order for 0.1 BTC on the Coinbase Exchange. If you cancel that open order, you'll get your 0.1 BTC back. If I've misunderstood, let me know the 6 digit Case number on your email.

I dug up your case for context. Even though it looks like you've gotten reasonably prompt and courteous responses, our processes have failed you, and your frustration is completely justified. 
I'm especially sorry that we didn't track the last message which we were cc'd on. Unfortunately, we really can't just reach in take the money back for you, so we need to establish better processes for resolving these issues with merchants without putting customers into a back and forth. We've achieved this with some merchants, but not all. 
To address the technical root of the issue; typically when our checkout pages ignore a payment, it's because they suspect a double spend attempt.  But even then we would at least call the payment completed after a confirmation, which in your case occured within the 15 minute timer. I do a lot of merchant support, and I've honestly never seen this particular combination of events. We're going to investigate it further internally. 
I realize that this is just cold comfort until you get your money back, and as much as I'd love to, I can't make sweeping promises to get you your money back immediately. 
Right now, we're working setup a call with someone at Expedia, and when we do, we'll stay on the phone to walk them through the refund process manually if necessary.

I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough time with our services. If you can provide me your case number I'll be happy to look into how we're handling it. 
That said, this does sound like a plausible situation without anything terribly off. We still haven't found a way to sell bitcoin via a bank withdrawal without having to cancel some orders. It tends to look like we do this on the price rise, but those are just the situations that get the most visibility. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:39:24
It's true. Our business model is not based on withdrawing and keeping large amounts of money from customers. Either you get your bitcoin, or you get your money back.

The permissions outlined in our [Mint API help article]( will share information, but not allow 3rd parties to take action on your behalf. 
Here's what the permission's do:
* balance	        View your balance
* transactions	View your transaction history
* transfers	        List bitcoin buy and sell history
* user	        View your basic account information
Note that "transfers" is not the same as "transfer", which allows transferring money between accounts.
So there is no risk of theft, if you are comfortable sharing information, you can share this key with a trusted 3rd party. Sorry if the warning was a bit scary, but better safe than sorry with API keys.

A recent update to the Coinbase _Exchange_, was intended to increase verification requirements for new customers. We've unfortunately realized that the change was applied to pre-existing Exchange customers as well. We're reversing the change now.
We will eventually be requiring further verifications to continue using the Exchange, but we will provide advanced notice before making the change, and give options for withdrawing your money if necessary.

@_date: 2016-02-19 12:58:36
Would you mind also PM'ing me with the email address on your Coinbase Account? Typically a purchase denominated in dollars should have the fees taken out of the dollar amount, so that the amount debited from your account is predictable. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:56:29
Just case there is any confusion about what it means to be "banned":
TLDR: You won't be able to buy or sell, and we'll ask you to move your bitcoin to another wallet, but we won't "freeze" you funds.

The best way to have this addressed is to contact us via email as mentioned by Michael. If you have a case open already, reply here with the 6 digit case number, and I will make sure that it receives a response in a timely fashion. 
I'm sorry, as I know it can be frustrating, but we don't cancel orders as a result of price action.  The only reasons we would [cancel an order]( are fraud prevention, or compliance purposes. We know we get it wrong sometimes, but we're working on improving that, and have gotten much better over time. 


We don't remove posts from the community which are critical or ask about cancelled purchases. This can be easily verified.

New blocks are at 100% capacity right now, so getting confirmations for transactions on the blockchain is taking a little bit longer. I wish I could be more helpful in this instance. At a higher level we've recently shipped improvement to our transaction generation processes, and are continuing to work on improvements for ensuring timely confirmations.

I agree. Everyone at Coinbase would, and we'd like to be better at handling these acute issues. I don't like to be seen as making excuses, but it's more difficult than we would have expected. We're working on it. 


It's intended for service outages (ie. the site is down, or the API is down, etc). A lot of people get text messages when we update status.coinbase.com, so we can't use it for issues that affect specific customers.

Very observant, it seems worthwhile to add some clarification:
- We were aware of this. 
- It helps to be good with advertising when earning $10 at a time from referrals, so it's not surprising that our Director of Data Science might do this in his spare time. 
- Our referral program is [open to anyone]( you are more than welcome to advertise for Coinbase.
About the apparently deceptive URL redirect, all referral URLs are of the form ` or ` but will redirect to ` It's very common in Adwords to have a "Display URL", which redirects to a URL that has some tracking parameters in it. 
ps. would you mind removing that name from your post? I understand that it's public information, but there's no need to draw attention to him.

This has happened with mycelium making payments to our checkout pages in the past. 
As a work around, instead of scanning the QR code you can enter the bitcoin address and payment amount directly, that will avoid the payment protocol's extra security check. Though only do so if you're sure there's no malware in your browser that could switch out a payment address. You can check this pay setting the amount on this payment page to something like 10 cents, then sending to the address shown there (not by scanning the QR).
