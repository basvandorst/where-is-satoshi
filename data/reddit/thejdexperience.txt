How can you sell $50 ebay cards when every other gift card place has been limited to $25, max?
Also 
Why was my order declined?
If your order was declined it maybe for one or more of the following reasons:
    - You violated our Terms Of Sale or Terms of Service 
    - We are unable to confirm your identity
    - We are unable to match the information you provided with your payment institution
    - You have continued prohibited behavior after receiving a warning or multiple warnings
So, you require a confirmed identity?

The data directory is on a RAID-0 volume, with bandwidth out the ears. But it doesn't matter because it isn't DOING anything. Disk IO, Network IO, CPU usage, and memory usage are all minimal and close to nothing for the most part. It feels like I am trying to download something from a long forgotten torrent that has one leecher and no seeders

No, only the past 18 weeks.

Is there even 500 Trillion dollars in the world?
Also, if someone controlled all the money, they are the lawmakers. The golden rule: He who has the gold makes the rules.

So you actually believe that as a planet becoming industrialized and dumping whatever the hell right into the atmostphere, sea, and underground, over 2+ centries, has had NO effect on the global climate?

At no point anywhere have I ever seen or heard of anyone who said "Oh, the blocks look full! I'm going to pass on this bitcoin thing"
