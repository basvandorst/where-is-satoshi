How are they not at fault?

So what? No need to be condescending. Especially when a child could understand that the analogy.
Nobody has said Bitcoin is perfect, and i'm pretty sure that people who support cryptocurrency would be the first ones in line to leave the moment something better was available. 
Most of us embrace change. Try it sometime - nobody says you can't change back ;)

I sold most of my BTC at $1000+, so I'm not worried about it. I sold to make money, not due to some strange overnight realization. 
The case is likely the same here.
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:29:00
wow you guys
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:19:29
You honestly think someone with 50k BTC could possibly dump them for this reason? 
Get a grip, man.

I was drunk too, so what? Don't get mad if you spill your purse in a public forum and get made fun of for it. 
Look out for all the reddit-thugs that now know you're a little *biiiiiiiiiiitch*.

You're lame as hell and have latent insecurities that you should address. Why bother even flaming the homie?
300 Bitcoins isn't Oprah rich. Personally, I'd rather have control over my money rather than giving the reins over to insecure untrustworthy banks and governments who don't have my best interests at heart. Why buy a nice car? Why wear nice clothes? Why have a big house? Are all these people literally inviting criminals to steal from them?
Perhaps. But the pro's outweigh the cons. And the guys point was that even as a "large investor" he's fine riding out the waves because he understands that a little swing means nothing, and that's advice new investors can take to the bank. And just so you know, yeah, 90% of my bitcoin assets stay in cold storage and I *never* worry about them being stolen. Infact, I can say with absolute certainty that I feel much safer with my bitcoin wallets than I do with my bank accounts. 
Oh, and I have more money than you and my dick is bigger. Rob me.

Its pathetic begging. Call it what it is.

Thank you very much! I developed it for our big launch last month. I'll definitely apply, thanks for the link!

Hell no! That's not who this is supposed to work. Thanks for your feedback man, not everything is sunshine and fairytales.
I'm a developer and project manager type of guy and I did the design myself because, well, I own the company and nobody was going to make it for me! I built the framework on Foundation 4 for the markup and other capabilities that I can easily offer my clients, but I didn't want the site to look like another Wordpressy, Bootstrappy cookie-cutter.
I don't think the site is stunning or the pinnacle of UX design, but it's a constant work in process, and as a young business ever hour spent working on the website is an hour not spent working with, or looking for a client. Most people don't make up their minds based on their prospective development teams website - they base it on the relationship with the person or team. 
It's difficult to juggle everything, but we are doing our best, criticism like yours helps us get there faster. So thanks!

For one, no, he is talking about market manipulation in order to make them money through other means.
For two, in all seriousness, some hackers just want to watch the world burn.

The currency had nothing to do with it. Get ya words straight son.

Most of my clients are not tech savy, they don't need to be airtight, and I've never encountered a situation where I was asked to protect especially sensitive data.
So when one of my clients comes to me asking for "Web Security" on some aspect of their framework, they usually just mean a simple BasicAuth, or SSL, or encrypted email - you get my point.
The fact of the matter is that I would be quite foolish to turn this business away to overqualified individuals. Most people have no idea (and wouldn't even try) to set up something like BasicAuth. Most people also like doing business with people they have previously worked with. And I would absolutely turn a client away if I thought myself of my team were in over our heads.
It just doesn't make any sense to me to not offer it. I completely understand the counter-argument, but I feel as though it doesn't suit a large portion of our demographic.
And if its a "they took err jerbs" type of thing, then you should get a better marketing team!

Whoa! Thanks so much! This is exactly why I made this thread :)
@_date: 2013-06-26 11:31:18
Thanks man! I forgot about these guys.
