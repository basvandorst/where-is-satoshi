Would you take a guess what Lightning Hubs are gonna be? Supposedly service providers, such as coinbase, will have open channels with people. Now change "service provider" to "exchange" and bibidi babidi boo its the same fucking thing. Granted LN hubs can connect to themselves and exchanges don't connect to each other as far as I know.


Its as tied as exchanges deposites and withdraws. LN is just an off-chain block-chain that sends the information gathered to the blockchain when the channel closes, is it not?


No need for technicalities. LN is, in essence, a data base of IOU's. What they plan to accomplish can already be done, is already being done, and will keep being done without it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:36:20
Im amazed how long this thing is taking. Exchanges such as Bitfinex pretty much have their own version of Lightning Network built in already for years. When you buy/sell a coin its not moved to/from your personal wallet. It stays in the exchange's wallet and you only "open the channel" when you deposit and "close the channel" when you withdraw.
I honestly don't have high hopes for LN just because it seems so simple to do and has been taking so long.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:46:26


They're practically the same shit. Hell, if a fucking exchange went up and said "We will now handle payments to merchants, all they have to do is create a wallet on our exchange and they can send/receive payments directly without transfer fees, only our deposit/withdraw fees apply" it would accomplish the very same thing LN aims to. And considering Coinbase to GDAX is already fee-less, Im fairly certain exchanges could do that very easily.

\&gt; Mid\-sized miners are going to start turning off around $6800\-7000. I'm curious to see what happens if it drops to this level for a while.   
  
Centralization. Turns out the exponentially increasing hashrate had a way bigger impact than simply doubling the fucking blocksize, something Blockstream/a lot of devs were against. Not doubling contributed to high fees and high tx times, which contributed to loss of adoption, which contributed to an even stronger speculative bubble burst. And we're gonna get miner centralization anyway. Should've just doubled that fucking shit and avoided 50$ fees and loss of adoption.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:19:44


Ah yes. As evidenced by pump and dump Bart Simpsons everywhere in charts. And as evidenced by the effects Mt. Gox Trustee has in price. Guy puts 6k Bitcoin as a market sell order and price goes to shit. Thats not decentralized.
The higher the price the more volatility it will have. Bitcoin doesn't work as a currency, which is supposedly its main objective. The project itself has failed. Still great for making a few speculative bucks and leaving a few bag holders here and there.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:58:07


Technically "decentralized". Have to discount mining farms \(specially Bitmain\) and Lightning hubs. Highly economically centralized.  
\&gt; higher market cap also means more liquidity which makes it more difficult to manipulate the price.   
Wow you literally have no idea how this market works. Market cap is an illusion, my friend. It accounts, for example, for lost Bitcoins that are never going to be anywhere. What determines the price is not the market cap, its the float, which is, in essence, the value recent traders are agreeing the price is. And the higher the price the more incentive for it to go up or down for trading opportunities., not to mention the impact of a huge buy/sell, which, yet again, goes back to the idea that its economically centralized.
\&gt; nah just because you dont understand how crypto works doesn't mean it failed   
Apparently I understand it better than you, with the advantage of market knowledge, something you're very lacking at, specially when you say "higher market cap also means more liquidity". That is "fine" if you're not a trader/investor and just a tech junky. Otherwise you're in for a wild ride that will top out at a lot of frustration.

As much as I dislike the Pump/Dump BCash godking that is Roger fucking Ver, he is not wrong here. If Bitcoin can't be used to buy coffee, essentially it means it can't be used as a currency. And if it can't be used as a currency, the project itself is a failure, since that's what it initially set out to do.  
So either Lightning proves good, and fast, or Bitcoin will be MySpace'd out of existence.

You're really wrong here. Like reaaaaaaaaaally fucking wrong.  
What determines Bitcoin's price is the float, which is, in essence, the price traders are agreeing upon. If there were only two traders, value would be whatever they agreed on: 1 cent or 1 billion dollars. It wouldn't make a difference if everyone else is hodling or spending or whatever. Traders set the price. Which is another reason Bitcoin can't be a currency. And if it can't be currency it's already failed its main objective.

Again, the market cap is irrelevant. If only two bitcoins are being traded and a guy buys one for 100m, then automatically Bitcoin's market cap will be 100m x number of coins. That doesn't matter because a large majority of those coins are lost, permanently held etc etc.  
What matters is the float: the number of Bitcoins being traded at a given point in time. If the guy puts his buy order for 100m in BTC's and A LOT of Bitcoins are up for trading, then it will, indeed, have a lesser impact on price. If few Bitcoins are being traded, it'll impact the price much harder.
You fail to understand that market cap is just the current price times the number of "mined coins". And the current price is the value traders are agreeing upon on whatever volume of bitcoins is currently being traded. Market cap is a lie/illusion.
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:03:55
That's not how it works. You may never sell, but unless you're buying, you're not helping the price keep its level or go up. Price is all about the float, not the amount of people holding the asset.

Its normal behaviour post speculative bubble burst. Its called the "desert crossing stage" and usually indicates the end of a bear market. But it can (and probably will) be fairly durable. The 2014 desert crossing phase took about 3 years.

But the thing is, to get out of USDT in Bitfinex, for example, you have to first BUY Bitcoin there (or another crypto) and move said crypto to an exchange where you can request a bank withdraw (aka exit the market entirely). The price would be higher in Bitfinex, as all their tradable USD is in fact USDT (which is why the price reached 7.8k in Bitfinex). Bitfinex has hours of withdraw delay, so it'll take a while for the dump to accumulate enough pressure. I pray people won't lose their money FOMOing in a crashing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:24:10
Bitcoin's price pumped from 1k to 20k last year. There's a chance this was done solely, or helped by, USD Tether printing. Bitfinex lead the bullrun/bubble inflation, and Bitfinex also has very close ties to Tether (same CEO's I think). So you can imagine the possible shitshow.

I'm sorry, are you under the impression that I'm misinformed about the tech? I know what it proposes, I know what it does. Problem is you seem to be blinded by a belief that its the second coming of christ.
The fundamentals are extremely flawed. Bitcoin will never work as a currency due to its deflationary nature. If its deflationary, it's better to hold it than to spend it, which is the very core idea of a currency. Imagine if the dollar was deflationary and its value increased in relation to other investments. Why would you invest in anything? Better just hold that sweet green bill, right? And guess what happens to the economical development when its better to not invest in new things and innovate? The economy simply doesn't go 'round. And it'll fail.
And the tech sucks. When people started getting interested in Bitcoin the fees skyrocketed to 50$ because the developers were too busy sucking their own dicks.


Yeah, no. I'm interested in the tech and I'm well informed about it. It IS a pyramid scheme, just not a classical one with a central figure controlling it. Unless, of course, Satoshi comes back from the dead and liquidates his 1m btc stash. That would be hilarious.
One more thing? 97% of all the Bitcoins are held by 3% of the wallets. And remember one person can have more than one wallet, so that sweet 3% could very well mean 97% of all bitcoins are held by 1.5% of the investors.
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:47:35
It's considerably riskier now, though. With regulations and the price dancing near no-profitability for miners.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:54:37


Because if Tether is proven to have inflated the entire market by producing fake money it'll literally decimate the confidence in Cryptocurrencies. That will mean there will be no way but out. And the way out is through banked exchanges.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:39:32
Possibly. Can't be sure. I didn't make this prediction _just_ two hours ago. I talked about it with a few traders about 3 months ago and this is the scenario I concluded would happen.
I don't think the spike stopped, though. I mean, a lot of people are still sleeping and are gonna wake up to a crazy chart, reevaluate their investments/positions, and I think the majority will opt to cash out. They will then have to move money to Bitcoin so they can request bank withdraws in local exchanges, and the selling pressure will begin. I predict a few exchanges will have liquidity issues.
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:24:29
Yeah? This doesn't exclude Tether as a possible culprit.
@_date: 2018-10-14 05:30:09

@_date: 2018-10-15 05:37:28
Yes, it will affect the price of Bitcoin. It'll likely be a crazy spike upwards as people try to move their money (USDT/USD) into Bitcoin so they can move it to a banked exchange (usually local ones). This will skyrocket the price of Bitcoin and cause a few uninformed users to FOMO the price up even more, before it eventually crashes close to nothing because Tether was one of the things responsible for Bitcoin's crazy price.
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:13:01
We're at the all time high. Now is likely not a good time to buy as it may dip a few percent soon (2-14 days). But long term it's likely to pay off if you can hold. In february one coin was costing $1500ish, we're close to $4500: thats 300% in a few months.
But nobody really knows, and for all we know USA could go to war with North Korea and Kim Jong unravels his EMP Dong Bomb and deactivates the internet from the world and bitcoin is worthless.

@_date: 2018-10-14 02:26:17


It is. Because of its deflationary nature, whoever got in earlier than you will have a better investment: lower losses and higher gains. If they exit the scheme, the price crashes (hello bubble burst) until new money starts flowing in. And new money is not easily gonna flow in while the price is crashing. 
Problem is this is the first time in Bitcoin's history miners are starting to mine at non-profit or at a loss.

Alt coins have literally no usage other than speculation value. Bitcoin has some usage, and a very strong name built over the years. If any of the existing cryptocoins is to succeed, it will be bitcoin, make no mistake about it.

I don't think the amount of time one person takes to open an account in a foreign exchange is relevant to a miner who's been at it for months/years. There is the issue with importing the money back, but usually miners are in it for the long run I think? So they might not even bother with it that much. I really don't think it'll affect mining.
Now, if it does affect mining and all miners in China stop, what do you think will happen to the price of BTC? Less BTC being created and/or entering the market, the "programmed" deflation will be stronger, and it'll probably result in a price increase.

Pardon the ignorant in me, but would "no more mining in China" actually increase the price? It would essentially mean less coins are being created, therefore less coins entering the market, therefore less supply.

So I was just thinking about this, and to me it seems the safest play is to sell everything at the time of the fork (literally the minute) and sit back for 2-3 days and see how the market responds. Youll have dollars to invest in whatever chain is surviving, be it BTC (highly likely), B2X (extremely unlikely) or BCH (slightly possible).
Miners will have 3 chains to work on, and BTC might get screwed over because of this. If the fork doesnt go through, though, then its BTC all the way.

The main "supporter" of BCH is also the main supporter of B2X (the Segwit2x coin). BCH was a failed attempt to take the Bitcoin name, and B2X will likely be the same. Just stay away. The only way BCH rises is people having your logic that itll go up just because, not for any tangible reasons. And since BCH and B2X are technically more alike to eachother than they are to Bitcoin, its likely the people who believe in them will be divided, effectively bleeding their market cap.
You want the right play? As soon as possible, sell out your B2X alt coin and buy more regular BTC.

Its not bad advice. Its selfish advice. Bitcoin will only achieve its potential if people start actually seeing it as money, and that will only happen if its used for small everyday transactions. While holding your value in BTC may exponentially increase your overall "balance" in the long run, doing so is not helping BTC go mainstream.
Personally, do what is best for you at the moment, considering the potential value of a bitcoin. Surely the guy who bought two pizzas for 10000 BTC a few years ago thought it was a good idea, and it probably was, at the time.

I'm fairly sure Im talking to someone from the biologies judging from your alias, and, as a lawyer, I don't feel very confident at all on what I'm going to write, but here we go:
From what I've read what happens is: the telomeres are an "extra" tail of your DNA. At every division, this "tail" breaks a little bit more and more, getting ever so close to your actual DNA. Then it'll start shortening your DNA itself on every division, and the problems related to ageing start happening. If you can "grow back" the telomere tail, the aging process will not reach your DNA, therefore preventing you from having aging problems in a cellular basis. BioViva and Liz Parrish claim to have developed a technique that does just that, and she was the test subject about 2-3 years ago, as I said. Of course that's fairly recent and a very little short time has passed to claim there are no complications arising, but so far so good it seems.
I also read that telomeres are important to prevent cancer (although I don't exactly remember why or how), but I think I'd take a long life risking/having over a short non-cancerous life. Specially considering medicine may end up finding better and better treatments and/or an actual cure for cancer in the next 100 years. So all things considered, telomere enhancing seems like a great idea.
Feel free to correct/enlighten me further, I would love getting knowledge/discussing on this subject.

As long as they have the keys (from mining), they can just send it to anyone in the world without needing to go through an exchange. Exchange bans only affects the trading aspect of Bitcoin in China, not the generating part.

Its not **that** easy. First you have to learn where to buy, and depending on your country its a bit of a hassle. In my case I had to verify id. That, and the deposit, takes a while (5-7 days).

We're aiming for the 6k all time high, having reacher 5900 twice in a week. Selling now is good if you need dollars, otherwise keep them as long term investment.

Well you never know. I've actually read up quite a bit on the subject, and the company that is closest to achieving actual immortality/life-prolonging is BioViva. They actually managed to do telomere enhancing therapy, and their CEO (Liz Parresh) was the test subject, 2-3 years ago. She says the company aims to bring this to the overall population, not just the very rich, and justifies it will be better to have it for the entire population. A population that doesn't age/has longer life quality is a population that works more and costs less to the healthcare system. So it may very well not be reserved for the top 1 percent-ish.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:56:50
