Thank you! Please, can you make a statement to the fact, that the purchase of the coin cannot be seen as a transaction on blockchain? My Localbitcoin wallet key still shows zero transactions. How can that happen, when the transfer off from the wallet has been on blockchain only minutes later. Something's fishy here.

Keepass, generating 40 characters. Still, I don't understand, why blockchain states that there were no transactions regarding my Localbitcoin wallet. I WANT TO BELIEVE that it's just a glitch, which their support might be able to reconstruct. On the other side: They telling me that my account was hacked without looking deeper in the case is likelier. You don't have an idea about the missing transactions maybe, do you?

If the other, traceable option is using PayPal, I'll stick happily with Bitcoin, though. Not using 2FA when handling valuables online won't happen to me again. That's for sure.

If I understand the system correctly, they do actually hold the private key. I can't imagine to hold them accountable in any way, though. I'd just like to have cleared up, how neither the incomin, nor the outgoing transaction are to be seen on my wallet's adress on Blockchain.

Zero. The transfer overview shows that the coin has arrived, but it was moved to another wallet i don't know about 5 Minutes later. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:46:50
It's from my localbitcoin transaction overview. 5 Minutes after I received the coin I bought. THAT isn't to be found on blockchain, though.

Localbitcoin uses a security feature, where you receive a login token via E-Mail, if you login from another machine. So my mail password would have had to be stolen as well. I just don't get it. I set up both the night before from my home. Secure passwords, using KeePass. Always used a VPN. Set up both from a closed notebook running tails. 
Anyways, using two factor authentification would have prevented this.
I'm dumb.
And I paid for it.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:46:02
That's my only hope. I can't stand waiting until Localbitcoin's response right now. It's 04.44 in the morning in my region and I still can't find no sleep.
Is there anyone else to contact in such a situation? Like "Bitcoin police" or such?
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:16:47
I just received a stock response from Localbitcoin's support team, stating: 
"If you are certain that there is an unauthorized transaction from your account, it is possible that someone have obtained your login credentials either through phishing site, social engineering or with virus from your computer.
In order to prevent this kind of incidents in future, please change your password and enable two factor authentication and/or login guard from your profile settings.
Unfortunately there are no way to reverse the transaction anyhow, and those bitcoins are gone."
Also they sent me the relevant logfile, which I'm about to analyse right now.
**In response I asked for the reason, why there's no transaction to be seen on my wallet's adress on Blockchain. I'm waiting for an explenation since about 9 hours.**
I'll post any info I can extract from the log.

Brute force takes time. My Localbitcoin account and mail account stem from yesterday. No way someone could have found it out so fast. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 08:08:07
Nothing, there is no escrow on live deals.
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:00:17
Nope. I use the 3G modem of my notebook. Also I used a VPN.
EDIT: Great question, BTW. Would have been an easy way for him to capture an active login. He even offered me to use his hotspot, but I declined. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:09:14
That is the adress the coin was moved to from my wallet. Not my wallet's adress.
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:05:45
As [the balance says ZERO]( I fear not. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 06:14:34
I'm 100% sure. WiFi is turned off when I'm on the road, only UMTS (mobile internet) is activated. Also Cyberghost VPN was online all the time. I work in IT and as such I know about the basics of IT security. 
Nevertheless, I was dumb enough to risk using Localbitcoin without 2FA. They explicitly tell you in bold letters, when your account isn't secured as good as possible. Right next to the logout button. In **bold** letters. 
I still don't believe that my account was hacked, though. The transaction of the purchased coin to my Localbitcoin wallet still isn't shown on blockchain, so something's inherently fishy here.
BTW: Despite working in IT, I didn't know "WiFi pineapple" as a ready made product yet. (Prolly not available in Germany) Thanks for introducing me to such an interesting toy!

Wow, that's quite interesting, thank you for the link!
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:11:26
BTW, did you mean my wallet's adress? I'll PM it to you, if you like.

EDIT: clarification
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:40:19
I have received an explanation by LocalBitcoin's support now and your guess is completely correct!
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:03:53
I didn't give it to him, as it was transacted via Localbitcoins system. [This]( is what blockchain states about my wallet's adress. I can PM you the key, if you like to have a look into it.
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:29:40
Nope. Completely different. The more i think about it, the less I believe the coin was stolen. Like BobAlison supposes, I guess it's a glitch in Localbitcoins wallet system. Blockchain still doesen't show the receipt of the bitcoin I bought, but it shows that the coin has been received by 129KQQ93LLpgPU7qz33k899ZFFQCgH1e1x 
This doesen't fit together in no possible way.
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:14:11
That's exactly what I'm wondering about!
[This is my transaction overview](
EDIT: Blockchain says that there were no transactions regarding my wallet. Localbitcoin says I received the coin I bought, which was transferred to nirvana 5 minutes later.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:19:54
Another question: When I search blockchain for my wallet adress, [there are zero transactions registered with it]( No entry of coins. Maybe I don't understand the concept? Shouldn't I at least find the transfer of the coin I bought onto it? Can someone explain please?
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:25:16
Danke Mann! [This]( is my Localbitcoin transfer protocol, if you'd like to take a view. I'll keep this post updated, as soon as there are news. Have a good night!
