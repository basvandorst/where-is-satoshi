I am an Ethereum and Bitcoin supporter.
One of the reasons I wanted to get into Ethereum was that talking to Bitcoin core devs a year ago or so, they told me they have no interest in ever modifying Bitcoin to have a turing complete language and it might fundamentally break Bitcoin if they tried. I understand their reasoning for saying so (to keep Bitcoin more stable) and that's why there has to be a symbiosis between Bitcoin and Ethereum. One is the major currency, the other is the programmable currency.

Like how many altcoins have WAY faster transactions and using SHA3 instead of SHA2? (Hell, SHA1 is already broken at a "we can do it with lots of computers" level. SHA2/SHA256 is one step away. Maybe a decade. Not good.)
Some altcoins even handle privacy in better way than Bitcoin. If you only have blinders on, you're going to have a bad time.
Get this: Some altcoins out there even pay people (literally/directly through decentralized voting a pool of funds) to shill them in the real world! It sounds so malicious, but I think it will actually work sadly.

Not if you're using ASICs for SHA256. (Which is what 100% of Bitcoin mining is today.)
If you were talking about Ethereum where the mine is full of GPUs, yes, you could be doing machine learning one day and Ethereum mining another day. (But to be honest this also doesn't work that well. Nvidia has the market on machine learning and AMD has the market on GPU mining. The best case is to use Nvidia to do machine learning and then have terrible hash rates when you're not actively running jobs.)

3) Who the hell cares? I think they are dealing with the same thing as Bitcoin had to deal with. People need a reason to change. And "oh look it's a new payment technology" sometimes just isn't enough. Sometimes it is. But not often.

So you exchange bits back and forth with (external servers? some "two factor auth" or something) and then to the device. How do you know that a virus is not simply waiting for this all to be done and right at the last moment when the message to sign goes to the device, the recipient's address is changed?
*Maybe* the device is waiting to see some special token from Ledger's own servers that says "this message is great".
Wait... I think I'm actually seeing a path to where this could work. Every device has a different public key pair from Ledger... (So you can't just read it out of your device and use it to compromise everyone else's devices)  Then, Ledger sends you a SMS with the address to where it is going. (So even if the path to ledger has been hacked on your browser, you'll see it on a different address on your phone.)
I guess the only flaw with this system would be that you'd become dependent upon Ledger's servers not going down. :-/


I have a data bus and I read all the bytes you send me along that bus and display them on a screen. What part of that system are you saying could be hacked? The side of the bus where the things are displayed? That is entirely firmware controlled / open source. The side of the bus where the computer exists? Yeah, that has a dozen viruses let's say. If the address is messed with there, you will see it by something different showing up on the screen. Get it yet? :-/

Actually it would, think about it, lol. As long as the Trezor firmware is secure (and that's why they made it open source), you can be sure that "whatever is sent across the USB bus is displayed by that little screen". Even if the computer had tons of viruses that intercepted everything going across your USB bus and messed with everything, the Trezor is going to display the address on the screen for the place it is sending it to.
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:20:46
Without a screen or buttons, how do you verify the sending address is not manipulated by malware on your computer? Does the USB dongle device simple trust and sign everything you throw at it?
I think Trezor solved these problems, are people finding a way to unsolve this or did I miss something? (Clever marketing maybe?)
Effectively: How is this better than just having a USB thumb drive with your private keys on it? (Unless that is what it is?)

Ledger can as well, check.


Malware can intercept everything you send to the ledger and change whatever bits it wants and you'd never know until it's too late, check. (Your computer screen can say "sending to address XYZ" and malware could intercept what goes to the device and tell the ledger "sign this to address ABC". This is what having a screen on the device fixes on something like a Trezor... they didn't do it just for show.)


I realize it is not *actually* a thumb drive. I meant - it is just as secure as one, a virus is going to be able steal your BTC in the same way.


I'd put convenience and cost as the absolute last things in terms of security. Sure it may make people think twice about paying for a Trezor, but I'd rather do everything else than use a device that is inherently insecure by design. I'd put a paper wallet secured in a lock box as being more secure than a ledger.

LOL. They are given a paper that says: "Because of quality problems, any refunds will be made in Japanese YEN."

It's already done, but most Bitcoiners don't want to admit that for some altcoins (including "the coin which must not be named"), smart contracts have been a solved problem for more than a year.
The problem you'll face is: Most programmers are lazy and don't want to redo programming efforts. Why spend time and effort making a copycat when you can just use the one that works today? Why spend time re-writing a GUI framework when there are endless GUI libraries?

Wait, Ethereum is launching today???
(Why would I want to use Counterparty when it goes around 70 times slower than Ethereum? 17 minutes vs 15 seconds...)

I think Apple would be well aware of this and keep it closed just for this reason. (As aggravating as it may make it for devs who actually want to do something cool. :-/  )

I heard you have to submit a palm print, eye print, face scan, driver's licenses, 5 references, birth certificate, death certificate (it is hell...), tax forms for every year you submitted them, and a transfer form that must be typed *and* handwritten in blue *and* black ink. And even then, you are limited to $100/day.

To be fair, their yearly cash flow is only about $3 billion. So it's a couple of orders of magnitude more important to them. ;-) Certainly if purse were pushing hundreds of millions a year (I have no idea, it looks closer to $1.5 million per year), they'd care a little.
@_date: 2017-04-14 21:59:34


I am absolutely not sure of that. The "coin which must not be named" is not the first one to the party, just the first one that got major adoption. Similar to Bitcoin in that way.


Even Bitcoin is mutable if enough miners agree on a new version of the chain.

Where is rootstock? Where can I download it and test it out? I don't think we "have rootstock" yet at all....?

So... they're going to use Ethereum instead of Bitcoin?

If you go to IBM's webpage on "blockchain" ( you will find a nicely designed page with a video at the bottom.
14 seconds in, they have Bitcoins falling on the floor. Wow IBM... wow.... shots fired.
"Blockchain is more than a way to exchange money or mine Bitcoins."
edit: Ohhhh... they are trying to change the context of "Blockchain" to be their actual product name. That's low IBM. Low....

What I'm saying is that there are dozens of alts with much faster block times and harder hash algorithms than sha256 in order to secure their blockchain.
Telling someone that they should trust me with 0 confirmations on the Bitcoin blockchain just seems wrong.
@_date: 2017-04-14 22:09:06
Wouldn't this be an incentive to move to altcoins that use a stronger hash algorithm?
@_date: 2016-02-11 19:27:19
One of the largest uses is to hold $422 million dollars. ;)

That doesn't make any sense. :)

Why not spread rumors that they don't unlock the files that way nobody will ever pay? (Even if they do unlock them.)

I see that as a claim, I see a whitepaper, but I don't see any source code yet? It seems they are very early...
@_date: 2017-04-14 07:22:05
Unconfirmed transactions are the very definition of unsafe. Just because it takes so long with Bitcoin does not mean that you should ever accept unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-15 02:51:53
I was still able to download their code through github and verify their cryptographic signature was good on a tagged version. Hooray for github? :) 
@_date: 2016-02-20 07:41:52
One way to fix this would be to provide bug bounties.
@_date: 2016-02-18 07:11:30
How do they know their systems still don't have a hacker roaming around inside? I'd worry more about this than "we can't reboot because we're a huge business".
@_date: 2016-02-15 09:30:30


Was going to ask how but Google answer it for me. ;-) (I wonder which places allow buying from OTC?)
edit: It seems that GBTC is not so great the more I research it. It can lose connection to Bitcoin's price because they aren't allowed to sell.
@_date: 2016-02-16 02:35:48
I think you misunderstand. For certain applications like Roth IRA, it is *far easier* to allocate your retirement portfolio to a BTC price tracking investment than to figure out how to establish a company and have it literally hold Bitcoins. (Regulations, boo.) Roth IRAs have huge advantages like tax free growth. (As long as you play by their rule book, no withdrawing before age 65, etc.) This is for people that don't want to be hounded by the IRS trying to collect on tax of crypto gains.
The only thing that concerns me about selling here is that it reduces the ability of GBTC to closely follow the actual Bitcoin price.

Ripple only has like 200 nodes and a very fancy visualization so you don't dwell on that fact! Yikes! Only 200!
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:18:37
Naw, the creators of Ripple would just issue more coins to push the price down and line their pockets more if they saw it go over a dollar or so. Not all cryptocurrencies are decentralized and fair, no matter how high they are on the charts.
@_date: 2015-09-20 20:29:17
Not really zero. If they were CPU mined, the computer had to cost something. A grand or two maybe?

I don't understand. Is this like dropping 2 USD into the ballot box? What does it do and why did you do it? (It's possible that this is something more I just can't read the greek language.)

Don't let them do this to you. This should be on your top list of things to ask when getting a mortgage. It's not an always thing. It's a negotiating factor.

Or he's just totally ballin' and at the point where he'd rather screw a mortgage company out of the extra profit they'd make over the long term and just pay off the debt a little bit.

I didn't mean to imply they were bad things, it just seems like if people can't handle change well, maybe a very small piece of change would go through easier?

Actually, it was techies in labs who first got it. I think we're still in that stage.
