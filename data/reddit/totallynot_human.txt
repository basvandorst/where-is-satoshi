Something I found interesting when looking at BTC, LTC, and ETH 30 day charts (USD).
Bitcoin 30 day chart
Besides some of the big sell offs and spikes in prices, bitcoin has been rising pretty steadily over the last 30 days. I drew a line to illustrate this. Now, whether or not the climb continues is the big question.
Litecoin 30 day chart
From Nov 16 to around Dec 6, litecoin was climbing at a slow but reasonable pace. The climb would begin to steepen and then spike and sit idle around $300. With not as much data to rely on, it is anyones guess as to which way ltc will go. It certainly looks to be the more volatile crypocurrency of the 3 so far.
Ethereum 30 day chart
What even is a big selloff? ETH gives no fucks, seems to be a lot of confidence around this one. While it has been increasing steadily like LTC, it has recently also spiked but doesn't seem to care too much about major sell offs. Sure it went down to around $650 very recently but quickly bounced back to around $750 as of this post.
Personally, I plan on exiting LTC in the near future as there is just too much uncertainty around it for now.
BTC really is fun to play with. As the more "mainstream" cryptocurrency, it seems there is a lot of panic around big selloffs resulting in pretty decent swings in price.
I'm keeping an eye on ETH right now. Seems to have a lot of potential for growth in my opinion.
