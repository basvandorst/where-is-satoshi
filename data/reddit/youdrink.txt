OK, here's what worries me about Bitcoin (and you're welcome to counter). Bitcoin is deflationary, which means over time, it's value increases. Wouldn't the guy with 30 oreos just start making 30x the amount of money of the guy with 1?

Since the amount of BTC is limited, won't they run out of things to pay miners in the future?

Lookup the fees for being a "taker" or "maker" on GDAX and learn to get good at that. Also, google or youtube a video about common candle patterns. I won't promise you make money, so do it with a small amount, but you'll at least learn something new

I think "terrible" is an exaggeration. If you are at all curious to try day trading, bitcoin is one of the best noob-introduction things you could try it in. Do it with a small value that you wouldn't be afraid to lose all of. And look up the fees. Always try to be the "maker". 
The 24hrs-7days is amazing for noobs, since it lets you practice on the weekends. And bitcoin has amazing 10% swings in a given day. I think it's risky to make MONEY doing day trading since the swings are so dramatic, but in terms of actually doing it? It's one of the easiest things available

Just test it out directly on an exchange, like GDAX or Bitstamp. To start, buy some BTC from your favorite place and load it in. Try playing with some limits and set a stop in case it gets bad. Don't use either system's "instant" feature since it has a larger fee. But something like 0.01 or 0.001 BTC should be super quick to move back and forth if you want to try it

Here's what I worry about, and correct me if I'm wrong. I think bitcoins value is going to continually go up. And lets say banks invest in them and they do start to become currency. 
You want to have a car loan, don't you lose money if you use BTC as a currency? If you loan 2 bitcoins today ($20k), have 0% interest for 10 years, then pay back the 2 BTC when the value is up ($25k), the banks make more money off you. Am I getting that right?

Doesn't that undermine the whole point of bitcoin? If Visa adopts it and it becomes a currency? It would just put it into the hands of third parties again, so what's unique about bitcoin then. 
I don't know, I'm new here, but bitcoin seems perfect as an investment currency, and suboptimal as a currency.

Dude, I fucking hope so! I think they're great haha

They're re-using all the memes from when bitcoin first reached these prices a couple months ago. I want to say this one was when bitcoin broke over $10,000...? But now they're doing them all in backwards
