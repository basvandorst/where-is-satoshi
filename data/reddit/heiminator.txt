Married with children did this first :-)

I know, but only people paying over 7.84 (atm the average amount) get bastion as well

thanks for the info!

A very good post, I never thought about many aspects of this before

I have an account there, but that kind of marketplace trade still takes a day or so to go through with the Überweisung, I am looking for a shop that sells me BTC via Sofortüberweisung in a matter of minutes/hours.

I do own a EC bank card, but not a credit card. And as I hate giving out my personal information to Companies (even if that company is Valve), buying Steam codes via Bitcoin is much preferable than linking my bank account to Steam. I am aware that i can buy Steam credit in stores too, but those stores aren't open 24/7.

I am european, we don't use credit cards to nearly the same extent that US citizens do, I personally don't own a credit card but can easily buy Bitcoins, thus Bitcoins are a viable and and easy way for me to buy Steam games.

Didn't know that, thanks for making me learn something truly useful in this thread :-)

It's mainly an American problem, I live in Germany and can literally buy bitcoins in a matter of minutes without leaving my couch.

Ever heard of local bitcoin exchanges? I buy my Bitcoins with cash, buying it with my debit card would kinda defeat the purpose of cryptocurrency.
I believe in cash, I hate electronic banking and I am quite sure I am not the only person who does.
My point is that Bitcoins have very legitimate use for many things that aren't illegal drugs.

Sounds good, thanks :-)

German here, our police will get a translator (and cover the cost for the translator) if you don't speak german and have been summoned to speak to the police.

Speak for yourself, I bought plenty of Steam keys via Bitcoin and I also pay for my VPN account with Bitcoins.

I am in Frankfurt, so Hamburg is a little far, but thanks for the offer :-)

All I wanna know is if I open an account at your marketplace right now and Transfer Money via Sofortüberweisung, how long will it take for the coins to end up in my Wallet?
And do you have some kind of "takes 24 hours to confirm" authentication thing that I have to go through first? Because I'd like my coins tonight, tomorrow at the latest if possible :-)
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:50:53
Thanks that was quick :-). So I don't care if it takes a week or even longer, but can I be certain that it definitely will be processed eventually?

This joke took me a little off guard, you racist fuck :-)
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:58:21
German here, I am pretty sure that a EU citizen has the right to open an account at a german bank without actually living in Germany

If you are in a position to want to buy from the Silkroad that means you have usually already dabbled with drug use in your life, which means you already came into contact with someone who can provide drugs at least once in your life. No one goes to the Silkroad because he suddenly decided that today is a good day to start doing drugs

That Borderlands 2 Offer sure looks tempting :-)
@_date: 2013-10-17 14:48:47
 is awesome
I get your point, but lets agree to disagree here :-)
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:26:16
Is it really this bad in the US? I live in Germany and I am easily able to buy Bitcoins in a matter of hours through various trustworthy online marketplaces (bitcoin.de, bitcoin nordic etc.), and with a large variety of money transfer options. In a nation of over 300 million like the US someone should be willing and able to provide a similar service to US citizens.

Is it possible to retroactively add a transaction fee or are you talking about future transactions?
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:50:37
Not yet :-(
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:00:29
Good summary, even though I am not new to this I learned something here (about the Games4bitcoins Subreddit to be precise) :-)
