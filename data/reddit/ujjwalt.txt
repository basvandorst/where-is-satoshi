What are your reasons for going all in on BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:59:21
Yeah even I was surprised you just put out your email like that ;)

I added fiat conversion for USD. Have a look and try it out. If you invoice in USD, we generate a hosted invoice that freezes the current rate for 15 minutes. Try it out.

That’s what I’m working on right now. Give me a week. I want to get the experience right.

An update to this:

Thanks. I'm targeting the niche who who would like to use Bitcoin as an actual currency and not only as a speculative asset. Maybe I need to go back to the drawing board and ask myself how to make this more compelling. I will also be starting a blog in a day or two explaining what my viewpoints here are.
Regarding the business model, it is free to use right now. I have a month long roadmap in place after which I will start charging for it sometime in December. We will have a free trial period and then will charge a flat monthly fee. I have something along $15/month in mind. We will not be charging any % on the amount you invoice as that beats the whole point of p2p payments.

It’s going to be on iOS right now. Do you have an iDevice? Android will take some time - probably 3rd week of May and yes you can absolutely look at the APK and scan it. Anything you need to satisfy any concerns. I’ll send you an email soon.

What hardware wallet specifically and how did you choose to use that instead of an alternative?
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:49:35


Could you explain that?
So if I understand correctly you keep everything in a hardware wallet and are just holding on to it till you can use it to transact in the future with your buddies? In that case you'll be moving to a mobile wallet right? Also which hardware wallet do you use and how did you arrive at that decision.

Thanks a lot for taking out the time.

What do you envision doing with them in the future since you're not interested in trading or at least day trading?

Thanks for taking out the time for such a detailed answer. This provides a lot of insight for me. I'm working on an app right now with the goal of helping users manage all their coins in one place. The app lets you link your exchange accounts, hardware wallets and cold storage and of course you get to decide what permission you want the app to have \(by associating limited permissions with the API keys you give the app\). The app lets you look at all your wallets, send and receive coins and even trade. Not a full fledged trading app because I'm aiming the app for users like me and you who do not day trade but believe in the long term value of cryptos doing stuff that you can't with fiat. I'm wondering if you'd be up to beta test it? Sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch but I'm trying to understand the use cases and problems so that I build something that's actually useful to someone like you. Even if you don't want to be a ß tester, I'd still like to talk more and understand where pain points are.
