he printed a QR code on one side that could be used to gain access to the coin.

It's a different argument. Obviously no one would make that argument about Shakespeare. However, people would make the argument that you're arguing against. You have to show why their argument is false based on the premise of the argument itself, not another one that someone would never make.

I totally get this sentiment. Hopefully if anyone has such an ideation they also realize that his death would minimize the probability of these coins being returned.

Depends on your temporal resolution.  On a coarse one, it's been trending down quite a while.

My comment is not about the analogy. I understand your analogy. The fallacy is making an argument that’s based on an analogy where the analogy is trivially knocked down (the straw man). What you’re not doing is arguing against the point about gold circuits directly beyond saying they’re not more important.

Hey thanks for the reply.  I tried responding to their support restating the question, so hopefully it'll be more clear this time (their response to my first question was basically 'fill out the form on our website', which isn't helpful for obvious reasons).  I'll call BoA back and see what they suggest.

That’s a straw man argument. Clearly not true and evades adressing the question at hand.

Cool, thanks!  I just talked to BoA and they said to use the routing number as well, but I got the feeling like the lady said to do that because I suggested it.

Just got off the phone -- same here.  I have to enter two 0's at the beginning.

Good time to buy. Any rise results in infinite profit!
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:32:52
I hope you do.  You guys were my sole consideration when it came to exchanges.  No longer, for obvious reasons.  
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:33:12
Yes.  This has to happen for payments to be processed.  Once interest in mining wanes, we'll have a problem.

I'm sorry, but I'm a little confused.  Did you complete a wire withdrawal from Bitstamp?  If so, how did you communicate to them the Routing and Account number?  
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:48:42
I sold about that much today!
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:32:31
At least it's not pink eye...
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:52:17
Thanks for the reply!  I was looking at bitstamp.  Quick questions:  If I want to withdraw my BTC, is the time required on par with that of, say, cryptsy? i.e., about an hour?  Also, do you know off hand what the withdrawal fees are? 
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:14:00
Awesome, thanks a lot.  
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:09:52
What if you have iphone and google auth. Will the cloud backup of the authenticator app suffice?

This made me literally laugh out loud. Thanks.

I 100% agree with this. After setting up all my security measures my first thought was that anyone could get into my bank account or credit cards.

I had a really frustrating experience with customer service in getting help doing a bank wire withdrawal.  I asked them where I should enter my US bank ABA routing number and account number because my bank isn't a part of IBAN, and the response was basically to fill out the form on their website (which doesn't have fields for that info).  I replied and tried to be more clear saying that my bank told me to include that information in the transfer, and I needed to know how to enter it.  Their reply was to give them the information they were asking for.  Very frustrating.  
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:25:20
OK good to know.  Do you have an alternative, safer, suggestion? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:10:59


Is this a joke? "unbelievably bright"?  It might *seem* bright, but to say that something in the future IS anything, especially IS UNBELIEVABLY anything, is ridiculous.  
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:13:34
hahaha.  I like this.  
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:34:54
This is a classic strawman argument. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:56:03
you're right, the internet is no place for perspectives to be discussed.

This is a good point -- I used multiBit which, to my complete surprise, charged me a fee that went to the developers just to send money.  I wish that fee went to the network! 
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:44:32
Thanks for this. What is more typical?
