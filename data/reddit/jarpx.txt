Good.  The dinosaurs must adapt or die, preferably the latter.  These corporate entities feel entitled to be the gateholders on information in a world where knowledge flows freely, considering it their right to both mold public opinion and to farm us for personal information that it can sell off to other corporate entities (who will use it to enhance the psychological exploitation that drives sales).  They are threatened by a world in which the common man demands privacy, to be treated like a human being and not cattle.

My knee-jerk reaction would be "their business model isn't my problem", but I understand your point, if everyone had that same mindset then it might become my problem if they couldn't afford to keep serving up content for free.  
There's nothing particularly special about reddit, though, if it went dark then a thousand clones would spring up to replace it.  Its most important feature is the network effect that draws enough people to generate and curate content (who do so for free, interestingly enough).  There's of course the time and effort spent to build the necessary code and infrastructure to serve it up at scale, funded by investments expecting an eventual return, but what if that's not a sustainable model?  What if an open-source, peer-to-peer, platform can offer the same experience and only requires a bit of bandwidth and goodwill from its users to survive?
It feels like the top-down approach to serving up information is predominant because of the potential for such platforms to have a return on investment.  As it stands now, most people are willing to pay for quality services, and there's a noticeable quality gap between paid-content and free content.  Reddit's an interesting case, as it has gold members essentially subsidizing the free members for a few extra perks.  That's a model that these publishers could be implementing, offer up a service that people are actually willing to pay for instead of demanding the right to farm us for information and suing software developers that give users the ability to filter the information going in and out of their own devices.

As bad of an idea as it is, technically you could just send someone a private key to a wallet.

This is huge, actually having large companies pushing for BTC up the supply chain seems like the next big step for bitcoin adoption.

One of the cool things about bitcoin is that if the "lost" wallets suddenly start moving coins out, everyone will see it.

I think the biggest issue holding this back is the distribution of bitcoin-to-peso exchanges in Mexico.  I have a few friends down there who know about bitcoin, but they were having a hell of a time trying to convert them back to pesos there.  I'm sure Western Union has thousands of locations there already.  As of right now no matter how easy you make it on the US side to send bitcoins, if the choice is to take a 5 hour bus ride to Guadalajara to get their bitcoins converted into pesos or walking down to their local Western Union, Western Union is going to win every time.

You're right, and I'm not saying it's impossible, just that I think that it's going to be harder on the Mexico side of things.

I'd say that's a safe bet, at least 40 years down the road.  I think the internet itself is a much more "disruptive" technology than bitcoin, and despite the breathtaking advances in communication between voters, the possibilities for collaboration and activism, governments are still basically the same 40 years later.
That said, you're certainly starting to see the sparks of change due to the internet spreading to repressive regimes, and maybe since bitcoin piggybacks on top of the internet that it will be adopted much quicker... but global changes to something so deeply rooted as government seem like they would move at a snail's pace compared to changes in technology that we are used to.

Bitcoin isn't about free money for running a program, miners are just the starting point of a bigger picture.

To be fair, part of the appeal of Ripple is that it is significantly more centralized and able to be regulated, it's just appealing to a dramatically different crowd.
