Lol, it's fairly obvious you have no understanding of economics whatsoever. Also you keep compulsively defending thieves.

The fact that they are being actively investigated and prosecuted when found out hints that what they are doing is, in fact, illegal. So yes, they are thieves, both in the moral as well as in the legal sense.

I think most people now realise that bitcoiners are liars, so it's no big deal.
"Bitcoin is useful, fast, secure, efficient, decentralised, and has no fees! It's the future of money!"
"Yeah right"
@_date: 2016-11-13 23:26:07


Just like Duke Nukem Forever in 1998!

You can only trust decentralization so far.

A bitcoiner stealing electricity from legitimate industries, schools and hospitals to profit from a worldwide pyramid scheme? That does sound like the free market in action.

@_date: 2016-12-14 10:29:07
No, at that point the investors will sell their bitcoins since they will get better returns elsewhere, and bitcoin's price will crash hard. Which will destroy the store of value fantasy, and make the use as currency harder.
Do you assume that anyone who has spent more time here would have drunk the kool-aid already?

You have understood their mindset perfectly.

The hashrate tells you nothing about the security, since it rises as better asics are introduced, and potential attackers also have access to them. The only real measure of security is the amount of fiat money spent in the POW, which in the long term is nearly equal to the total block reward.

No. You need to do the work yourself. Read a university-level mainstream macroeconomics textbook.

For some reason a lot of lies are propagated about the properties, capabilities and uses of bitcoin.

Really. As to your question, I'm here to warn people against investing 10000€ in the pyramid scheme that is bitcoin. If you understand economics and are not a fraudster yourself you should agree with me.

Pascal's wager, but with bitcoins

Buy more after losing 80% of their investment? Few would.
@_date: 2016-12-12 21:24:07
Quite a few did, because this was when a lot of new people entered the game due to the hype.
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:31:13
@_date: 2016-11-30 16:15:50
No, you misunderstood, bitcoin is the worldwide pyramid scheme. I don't see how the Venezuelan system is relevant here since the point was that the bitcoin miners are stealing electricity while hospitals and legitimate businesses suffer from blackouts.
@_date: 2016-12-10 09:36:26
This is an idiotic argument because the value of the service bitcoin provides compared to the banking sector is even tinier.
@_date: 2016-11-13 20:35:04


6.in theory
@_date: 2016-11-25 10:10:17
And it does not really matter, because to guarantee a constant level of security in the network the total mining fees have to be a fixed percentage of the total transaction amount.
@_date: 2016-12-16 10:36:47
Sorry for your bad debit card.
@_date: 2016-12-10 22:30:08
Lol, even more transaction costs on top of the existing ones
@_date: 2016-11-13 23:30:41


Yeah, centralisation is a great resource saver.
@_date: 2016-11-29 10:32:51


Strange, I would just outlaw it and then arrest the few remaining devs, miners, node operators, and execs and owners of bitcoin companies.

An element can only belong to a single subset in a set partition, how revolutionary.
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:40:05
And once the investors notice they aren't getting decent returns from bitcoin anymore, then what happens? 
@_date: 2016-12-05 09:55:14
See, now you're trying. If you're going to lie, make it a big one.
@_date: 2016-12-12 21:20:01
If you had actually sold the price would have crashed because the market depth is so tiny.

Daytrading small amounts back and forth. If a significant number of users decides to sell, the price will crash.

Why? Do you think pyramid schemes can go on forever so that everyone will come out ahead if they just wait for a while?
@_date: 2016-12-15 12:16:48
Why would I? Like with all pyramid schemes, it's extremely hard to predict when they will start to collapse, and more importantly, I think it's immoral to steal money from scam victims.
@_date: 2016-12-20 11:41:45
Ok. Since your credit card is linked to your loan, you have to keep it anyway, and pay the fee anyway. Using bitcoin just means you have to.pay additional transaction fees on top of that for no good reason?
@_date: 2016-12-26 21:35:00
You missed the joke.
@_date: 2016-12-16 10:40:48
To get SEC approval. Do you really think they'd greenlight a system based on non-audited code controlled by Chinese miners?
What's the point of using a blockchain in the first place? Beats me.

Lol, you're an idiot.

QC provides different kinds of speedups in different tasks. A huge one in breaking many asymmetric cryptosystems, a smaller one in reversing hash functions. But the decing factor is not reversibility.

Lol, checks in AD 2016.
@_date: 2016-10-25 08:34:10
There are plenty of countries around the world where checks were phased out 20 years ago. Bitcoin solves the paystub mailing problem only in the sense that it forces the employee to accept paperless stubs. Which is something a shitty employer could already do now.
@_date: 2016-10-28 20:18:04
It's funny because from an outsider's point of view bitcoin is *exactly* the same.
@_date: 2016-10-16 11:49:31
No. The qc speedup has nothing to do with reversibility.

Heh, you sure got your ass handed to you there :D
@_date: 2016-10-28 00:41:43
This is problematic indeed! Luckily bitcoin does not suffer from the same problem because Satoshi and the other early adopters *deserved* their coins.
