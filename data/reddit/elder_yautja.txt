You can go on to Localbitcoins. Basically craigslist you arrange to meet someone in a public place like a Starbucks and make the trade there i.e. pay in cash and they send the bitcoin to the bitcoin wallet on your phone.

I think the biggest thing right now is the debate over scaling. Personally I think its overblown, but I can understand why it would hold things down. 
By the end of the year I think things will improve quite a lot. We've got a hard fork to 2MB coming up, but not to Classic its in Core its supported by consensus, and SegWit is being integrated in 3 or 4 months. Add in the block reward halving and I think by Q4 2016 things will be looking a lot brighter.

I'm an early adopter. I managed to get in while it was still in double digits. But I'm not going to brag about it, I consider myself fortunate. I didn't have a crystal ball, it wasn't some great talent or insight. I saw which way the wind was blowing, bought a load of bitcoins, which I still have, I didn't get goxxed (another blessing) and I got lucky. Most speculative investments don't pan out.
I heard about it. Bought some. The price went up. I got lucky. That's all there is to it.

There is also the added benefit that, if Satoshi for some reason did do that, he could only do it *once*.

Well it depends really what you want to do with it. Since you brought up investing I'll assume you are looking to buy some coin as a speculative investment, and sit on it for the foreseeable future in the hope that it increases in value. (Full disclosure this exactly what I am doing).
In that case its actually pretty simple. Find an exchange you like (I hear Coinbase and Kraken are good), and buy some bitcoin. You can also buy in person (bitcoins cannot be counterfeited so there is no chance of being ripped off).
Buy an amount you feel comfortable with (with all the caveats that your capital is at risk and do not invest more than you are willing to gamble with).
Do not store your coins in the exchange. Exchanges are online systems, and online systems can be hacked. So your biggest problem is going to be security.
Go to bitcoinpaperwallet.com and print out a wallet from an offline system (if you have an old laptop lying around that you don't use, use that and then reformat the hard drive. Make sure you are not connected to the internet).
A wallet (which is really a key code) is how you hold bitcoins and wallets which are generated offline are called "cold storage". By printing your key codes out on paper from an offline system, there is no possibility of being hacked, making paper wallets a simple and effective cold storage.
Put it in a safe. Sit. Wait. The block reward (the rate at which bitcoins are minted) halves every 4 years until it hits 0. There is a block reward halving in July, and then again in 2020, and every 4 years after that. Personally I'm sitting on mine through the next 4 halvings (until ~2028), I think it will increase in value quite a bit by then.
@_date: 2016-04-30 11:56:06
I'm sure there are many. Bitcoin, as an investment, encourages a *loyalty* that you simply do not see anywhere else. I've owned stocks in the past, and sold them without hesitation the second I felt the winds change. There is no loyalty to any particular stock or company it is a cold rational decision plain and simple. But bitcoin is different I think a lot of hodlers (certainly myself included) are hanging on like grim death come hell or high water.
@_date: 2016-04-08 17:22:13
A lot of them probably were. For example the upcoming halvening will probably mean every miner will have to upgrade to 16nm or go bust. Anything older and they won't be efficient enough to be profitable.

Just out of curiosity is that 300,000 coins daily that are actually traded on exchanges, or is it just 300,000 coins move on the blockchain every day? Because if it is the latter a lot of that would not necessarily be coins being bought and sold, but simply moving coins from one address to another with no coins changing hands (in effect moving coins from your left pocket to your right).

First of all congratulations. You probably won't need to save for her college tuition unless she is going to become a doctor or something. I have a theory that college is going to be really cheap 20 years from now, because now its getting so expensive (and for degrees not worth the paper they are printed on) that the whole system is going to collapse. Like a 2007 housing crash, except for university.
@_date: 2016-04-17 10:36:44
Major bubbles tend to take the price up by a factor of 10, and then drop 80% of the gains, so I would expect the next bubble to take the price up to the $4,000-5,000 range, and then collapse back to $900 or so.

I hate to lower the tone, but I just want it to be the thing that makes me filthy rich...
@_date: 2016-04-08 08:08:40
About 3600 bitcoins are minted every day by the miners, and they have to sell about 95% of those to cover running costs so even if no one else was selling, there's still well over 3000 coins for sale directly from the miners.
If those sold out, then what happens is the price gets bid up because you have less supply. The higher the price goes, the more people are willing to sell.
@_date: 2016-04-26 05:59:37
I'd say it's either $3,000 or $10,000 at that point bitcoin becomes the hottest commodity on the planet. Even then I'm not selling. I'm hodling through the next 4 block reward halvings at least.

I did something similar when my nephew and niece where born I gave my brother (their father) 2 paper wallets with a bitcoin each and said the kids have to get them when they turn 25. Until then, they're not even to know about it. They are 1 and 3 respectively so I'm hoping 20 years of growth will mean 1 coin is a substantial sum, and I said 25 rather than 18 or 21 because I don't want them to blow it while they are in college I want them to do something more responsible with it.
Btw handy tip for paper wallets that you want to hold *long* term; schwartz jars. I don't know if you have this brand in the US but you probably have something similar. These things:
Once they are empty wash them out roll up your paper wallet stick it in there. The glass is really pretty thick and the seal on the lid is 100% airtight.
It means you can stick them in odd places; inside walls, crawlspaces, under your floorboards etc without worrying about dampness and stuff like that.
@_date: 2016-04-16 15:34:16
This is true for bitcoin as well really. What if Satoshi (pbuh) sold all of his bitcoins tomorrow? That's about 1 million coins just dumped on to the market unexpectedly. Nothing is ever 100% unpredictable. Although, bitcoin is a huge improvement over previous commodities.

Yes I suppose that would be the real worst case scenario, but in order for that to happen they would need to be physically destroyed, and I keep mine laminated in sealed glass jars.

Inflation steals by transferring purchasing power from the masses to the people closest to the printing presses. Deflation (in an asset based system like gold or bitcoin) increases its purchasing power via organic appreciation of value, not by siphoning it from the already existing money supply.

I think price will go up at least a bit because miners create a lot of downward pressure on price. They have to sell most of what they mine just to cover electricity costs. That's about 3,000 coins per day, and although 100 times that are traded daily on exchanges, miners are particularly motivated sellers (bills are due at the end of the month).

Faucets are a waste of time. A bitcoin is at the moment worth something like $430 USD. In order to make 1 whole bitcoin from a bitcoin faucet you would literally have to spend hundreds possibly thousands of hours performing some repetitive click bait task.
You said yourself you've been at it a few hours and earned 2 cents. Even Mexicans earn more than that per hour. I do highly recommend getting into bitcoin but the best way to do that is either 1. just buy some or 2. get paid in bitcoin.

As far as I'm aware any wallet connected to an online system is *by definition* not a cold storage wallet.
I keep a small liquid amount of bitcoin on a desktop client (usually to give small amounts as gifts) but the majority of my holdings are in a multiply backed up offline encrypted paper wallet (we're talking thousands of dollars here, not an amount I would carry on my android).
I don't plan on breaking that piggy bank for at least 10 or even 15 years. If I *had* to, I would import it to an online wallet but then I would consider it compromised and transfer any remaining balance to a new cold storage wallet.
Basically in order to be "cold storage" it needs to meet 2 criteria 1. the private key was generated from an OS that does not connect to the internet and 2. has never been spent from. Once it has a transaction out, consider it "warm" storage.

I think we're going to see another mega-spike in 2016. April 2013 the price went from 30 bucks to 270. In November 2013 it went from about 120 to 1200. In both instances that's roughly a 10x increase, although it was short lived in both instances.
I think we're going to see another 10x increase in 2016 up into the 4000 -5000 dollar range, only to see it crash again, but only back to 800 or 1000. That seems to be the pattern every time it spikes then crashes its still twice as high as it was before.

Any prediction I make will almost certainly be wrong but I do think we could see 5 figures for 1 coin within a couple of years. In 10 years? I hope to see 6 figures for 1. I don't think that's impossible but like I said most bitcoin price predictions look silly in hindsight.

In that situation I would have made alternative arrangements with my employer. Ask if its possible to be paid weekly rather than monthly, withdrawing my money as soon as I get paid, and paying bills in cash rather than direct debit.
But if the *only* money you have is your paycheck for that month then you are living paycheck to paycheck. Most people are not *quite* that bad off so for most Greeks this is their savings at risk. If you have left your long term savings in a Greek bank and its only *now* occurring to you that maybe they aren't safe there...

Not counting my house, probably 50%. I own some gold (not much) and some silver, and a couple of dozen bitcoins in cold storage. I don't currently have anything in stocks since I think its on the verge of a nosedive (I would be buying in at the top of a bubble) and real estate here in the UK is creeping into bubble territory again too. I don't keep a lot of cash savings because honestly what's the point?

Second, its only a few days until Christmas so trading volumes are dropping off. Always gives the bears the upper hand.

The US, or more accurately the US Federal Reserve, is running racket. That's what this is its a Mafia, and bitcoin is cutting in on their action. The US Dollar acts as a kind of de facto one world currency, and they control it. The golden rule is he who holds the gold makes the rules. Right now that's them.
Bitcoin pulls the rug out from under them by being a truly international currency, while at the same time being completely neutral. It doesn't see countries, it doesn't understand borders, or favour any one. If there is one thing the US doesn't want, its fairness. They have a (massive!) unfair advantage, and they are doing to do their damnedest to keep it.

But surely they must? If a transaction is so many bytes, and a block is ~ a megabyte, then only so many transactions can be included in one block. If bitcoin is to become as big as visa or mastercard then its going to be hundreds of thousands of transactions per block. Unless I'm just totally missing something and you can process 100 million transactions per day with a 1MB block size limit.

$200's was probably undervalued. In November 2013 the price went from $120, to $1,200, then bombed again. So no one knew what the "correct" price of a bitcoin was. Price discovery is a very important mechanism and the boom and bust of MtGox threw it into disarray.
It spent all of 2014 dropping in price, and most of 2015 just down in the dumps. This was the recovery. It took almost a whole year of bitcoin's price doing not much, in order for confidence to return to the market. For a whole year no one could get the price below $200 only then were more people comfortable assuming that's definitely as low as its gonna go.

Well we might not get those now since the cops raided Wright's house hours after he was outed. If he is Satoshi, I doubt he's going to be delivering those white papers from jail.
If Satoshi is still involved, cool we'll see the white papers when they come out. But outing Satoshi is bordering on criminal reckless endangerment since it puts his safety in real danger. If Wright really is Satoshi, how long before he's spending 30 years in jail for aiding terrorism on the pretence that someone donated a few dollars worth of bitcoin to ISIS?
Satoshi's anonymity is self preservation that's more important than finding out a few months ahead of release that he's working on some new material.

1. Not really. If you took the combined market cap of *all* cryptocurrency, 99% of it, minimum, would be made up of bitcoin. Some other cryptos might make it or might not but personally I wouldn't waste my time and money.
2. Cloud mining avoid like the plague. Its all Ponzi scams.
3. No. The payouts are tiny, and I mean *tiny*. If you clicked them once a second, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, then you might actually earn a bitcoin after about 17 years of that.
4. Depends what kind of wallet it is. 99% of all the bitcoin I own is in one wallet, but that's my cold storage address. My bitcoin "vault". For small change I just use my phone.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:22:22
As opposed to holding on and seeing if it goes higher still? Yeah I probably would just sell them. The peace of mind I would be buying if I outright owned my house would be priceless, plus it would free up a lot of my income per month if I didn't have to pay a mortgage (money which I would redirect into other investments).
If bitcoin goes to $10,000 as far as I'm concerned its not worth waiting to see if it goes to $100,000. You can make 10x your money in other investments, and a million dollar bitcoin isn't going to happen. Bitcoin would have to increase $273 *per day*, every day, for 10 years straight, in order to be worth a million a piece. Its not gonna happen.
If it goes to 10k a piece, that's 40 times its current value. That's good enough for me.

Probably not by much. At least, not right away. Greece is a tiny country with a mostly tourism dependent economy. But Greece is an albatross. If Greece goes it could drag the whole EU down with it because EU banks 1. hold a lot of Greek debt and 2. are so ridiculously over leveraged they are humped of Greece defaults (which they will). That means a bailout, probably from Germany, who have already bailed them out, twice now I think.
If the entire Euro currency went down in flames, which I think it will it was a disaster from day one, that *would* affect bitcoin prices because that's 600 million people of affluent nations who are watching their pensions go up in smoke.

I'd be ecstatic with $10,000 a coin. I've got more than 20 that would give me over $200,000 (about £130,000 here in the UK) I could pay off my mortgage with that, and still have £20,000 to spare.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:51:00
But think about it lets say you got in really early, say 2010, and got 1000 BTC for a dollar a piece, what's the point in spending another $240 dollars to make it 1001? 240 bucks is nothing to sneeze at and it increases your bitcoin holdings by 0.1%.
Its not compound interest. Interest is earned passively, just buying more of a commodity to increase your holdings is not interest.
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:28:37
My guess is that the new drachma will be aggressively inflationary from the get go. The new currency would be born in weakness its starting when Greece is staring down the barrel of a depression, if its not already there. I reckon the government would do something along the lines of the US Fed's quantitative easing, to try and jump start the economy. Its never worked and its never going to, so of course they're going to try it.
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:47:34
Inflation. People do not realise how disastrous this really is. It's slow motion theft, it goes unnoticed because it takes years but this adds up to an absolute fortune in potential earnings. You know if you put $10, 000 in a fund that pays 10% per year your money doubles every 7 years, which means if you do that at 21 and then leave it until your early 60's, purely on compound interest its now worth more than 2 million dollars.
But this works both ways as well if the inflation rate is 10% you are losing half of your money every 7 years, as well as all potential gains like those above. Over your lifetime this adds up to millions in opportunity costs. This is the sheer amount of wealth that is being stolen via this stealth robbery called inflation. You don't see the robbery because you never see what could have been.
Bitcoin cannot be inflationary. It's fixed, and I expect price volatility to stabilise in time to the point where bitcoin becomes *deflationary* at a rate of 1 or 2% per year.
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:10:36

The Euro will fail. It was doomed from day one. Its not even 20 years old and its already showing serious stress cracks. Central planning does not and can never work. Greece lashed themselves to Germany's mast and this is what happens.
When Greece leaves the Eurozone, that sets a precedent. It means countries *can* leave. How long before Italy or Spain follows? This is the beginning of the end of this socialist fantasy of a federalised Europe, and with it the Euro currency.
I think Europe, and probably the entire world (China has its own problems) is heading into a depression because I think the next crisis will be a sovereign debt crisis. The 2008 crisis, the credit crunch, was a shot across the bow. I think the next one will be worse because now countries are more in debt (a lot more), banks are more over leveraged and more "too big to fail" than ever, and we've still not recovered from the last crash 7 years ago. The entire phony "recovery" has been a dead cat bounce. When the next crash hits us its going to hit harder and we'll be in a weaker position to deal with it. The 2008 crash put us into the worst recession in 80 years and here in the UK we had an *triple* dip recession (unprecedented). When the next one comes around, which I think will be less than 2 years, its going to knock us not into a recession but full blown depression because we'll not only have all the problems of a recession like I said we're already in a weak position and we'll be facing the complete collapse of a currency used by half a billion people. We'll probably see the reinstitution of the drachma, and the deutsche mark, and the franc, but confidence in government currency will be shattered. Some might make it, some won't. Probably most won't because they will be subject to severe inflation as these countries attempt to inflate away their national debts.
I expect we'll see severe capital controls (look for those in Greece very soon) which will only compound the problem.
Merkel and the other eurofanatics are losing control of the situation and when they completely lose control they will do what all governments do in a crisis; make it worse.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:57:11
A good strategy. Monthly purchases is a good way to cost average your way in and $50 is not a lot to risk. What you need though is a cut off point. Its what? $240 just now? So $50 gets you about 0.2 BTC, but would you still buy $50 worth if it was $2,400 per coin? You would only be getting 0.02 BTC in that case.
As the price goes up there's a law of diminishing returns so you need a cut off point where if the price goes above X, say $500 per coin, you don't buy any more.

1. YouTube is a good source. Stefan Molyneux has a couple of videos explaining bitcoin in detail and anything with Andreas Antonopoulos in it is always very enlightening. Honestly though, best way to learn is to use it. Get a feel for it. Set up some wallets and practice by moving pennies worth back and forth.
2. Cloud mining? Danger! Danger Will Robinson. STAY AWAY from cloud mining the vast majority are Ponzi schemes. Look into GawMiner if you want a good example.
3. As far as I know, right now it is a time sink but it probably could be updated to do something useful.
4. I'm unaware of any insoluble problem with bitcoin. It has problems, but I believe these will be solved because there is a vested interest in solving them. Bitcoin is almost 7 years old if there was a truly terminal flaw in it it would have happened by now.
5. Yes that's true. You do not actually hold bitcoin, the coins themselves are held in the blockchain, so technically anyone who is running a full node has all currently mined bitcoins on their computer. What you hold are the access codes, called a private key. If you lose that, those bitcoins are stuck in that wallet forever, and can never be unlocked. What happens to the value? Well if those coins were already just sitting there anyway, they were already illiquid, so nothing really. Its really the same thing as a ship carrying gold bullion sinking.
6. I find the best ways are the simplest ways. Buy, hold, forget. I have 21 coins in cold storage and that's where they are staying for the next 5 to 10 years. I try not to pay attention to day-to-day price swings. So look into cold storage (I use paper wallets) practice sending small amounts to paper wallets and then getting it out again, until you get comfortable. Practice BIP38 encrypting them so you have two factor authentication. Do this with 10 cents a time until you really know what you are doing, then buy whatever bitcoin you are going to buy, send it to a paper wallet, and put it in a safe. (or do what I did and make multiple copies of the same encrypted wallet, and store them in multiple locations).

Strictly speaking you do not hold bitcoin. My computer runs a full node, so it has a copy of the entire blockchain so really I have all ~14 million currently mined bitcoins on my pc right now. As does anyone with a complete copy of the blockchain. The difference is I don't have the private keys for all of them.
That's how you prove ownership you do not hold the bitcoins you hold the access codes for a wallet. So there can be many copies of the same bitcoin, but it can only be spent once because once you do, the entire network agrees that transaction has occurred.
That's why MtGox was such a disaster they held everyone's private keys. That's what they mean by "custodial" accounts all the keys were being held by MtGox, and when that went tits up the keys were lost forever.
The coins still exist, but its "dead" bitcoin, sometimes called "burned". The keys are gone, which means its locked in that address forever it can never be spent.

Bitcoin itself has no restrictions, but depending on your country of residence your experience will vary. Here in the UK I buy using a bank transfer its quick, easy and you don't have to be over 18 to have a basic bank account.

I've always thought the accusation of hoarding made no sense. Taken to its logical conclusion if saving is bad we should all always spend as much as we can as fast as we can. We should treat money like hot potatoes.
But of course if we did that there could be no capital investment, so some saving is essential for the economy. So it now falls on them to show what is the ideal amount of savings and why, which they cannot do because that doesn't make sense. How much you should save depends on your circumstances. How old are you? What's your profession? Do you have kids? What are your financial goals both short term and long term?
So in order to prove hoarding is bad they have to give a one size fits all figure to all of that. Their entire position is nonsense on stilts.

The free market is a self correcting system and if it is faulty, then pretty much by definition any central policy makers *must* be even worse. That's simply logically inevitable. The "market" is simply the sum total of all voluntary human interactions.
Any attempt by a central authority to control it will always inevitably lead to a *worse* outcome because they are not in full possession of the facts. They are not and can never be fully informed because no human can possess all of the knowledge of the market. Only the market itself cumulatively holds all of the information.
Bitcoin is not really the solution, because there never was a problem to begin with. For 5,000 years gold and silver have been considered money and the market took care of itself. The need for central banks is really quite new its only if you have *fiat* currencies that you need a policy at all, and all fiat currencies reach the value of 0 sooner or later.

I think the problem is, for now, increasing supply of bitcoins due to mining combined with fixed demand. The available supply of bitcoins still goes up by 3600 per day, and I think for the moment everyone who is interested in bitcoin is in bitcoin.
What we need is radically increased demand and at the moment demand is kind of stagnant, but that's only because bitcoin has not gone mainstream yet. Bitcoin got half a trillion dollars of start up investment in 2014, and it will top that this year. These start ups have, well, *just* started up. They are not producing anything yet they just started.
These will be the companies that bring bitcoin into the mainstream but it will be 2-3 years before this start ups start releasing whatever innovations they are working on. I think 2017/2018 will be when bitcoin finally starts to go mainstream and the price will explode because that is what will allow the other 99.5% of the population to get involved.
Until then, we hodl.

The Euro is going to crash, but not any time soon. The problem for the Greeks is that the Euro is going to be far too *controlled*. If they leave it in the banks, its vulnerable to seizure. 
OK that's an obvious one so they take it out the bank and have it all in cash. Very likely Greece is going to institute stiff capital controls, so they will face barriers moving money out of the country etc.
If Greece leaves the Euro, they can no longer *use* the Euro. So they've got a big pile of paper which is not legal tender in that country. 
Sure they could still use it unofficially, the same way half of Africa uses greenbacks, but more likely the Greek government would institute the Drachma, but likely a very inflationary currency, so people would prefer to trade in euros (even though they cannot pay tax in them).
That means a black market for euros and probably severe penalties (prison time) for being caught transacting in euros.
So I really fail to see how the Euro is safe. Yes they could ban bitcoin as well but at least with bitcoin you don't have it in physical paper form. You can make back ups of your keys. You can encrypt it. You can use TOR, or a coin tumbler.
Neither currency will solve their debt issues. There is no solution for their debt issues they are a quarter trillion in debt there is no way that's getting paid. The problem they need to solve now is that one that's coming; what happens to the euros in Greece once Greece defaults and is out of the Euro?

I think that tipping point will be within 3 years. The bear market of 2014 was, in my opinion, a healthy pruning. 2009 to late 2013 the percentage growth in bitcoin still makes me cry. That cannot continue forever non-stop that's how bubbles occur. 5 years of extreme growth, and then 1 year to dial it back and regroup. I consider the 70% drop in price to be a wise strategic retreat to fortify the base before the next charge. I think we'll see consistently rising prices in Q1 of 2015.

Wtf what? Bitcoin faucets pay out only a few hundred satoshis (at most) every 10 minutes or so. There are *100,000,000* satoshis in 1 bitcoin. Do the math 500 satoshis every 10 minutes at that rate it would take 17 *years* to get 1 bitcoin if you worked at this 8 hours a day 5 days a week.

I don't understand why merchants are hung up about this idea of confirmations. Sure it takes on average 10 minutes to get a confirmation, so 1 hour for 6 confirmations, but it takes a WEEK for a Visa/Mastercard payment to get confirmed, and they have chargebacks bitcoin does not.
Merchants just swallow the risk involved in accepting card payments because its like 1/1000 chance that it will be a dud. Bitcoin has much better odds than that.

I'd say there are 2 major benefits.
1. That trust in 3rd parties is about to disappear in a real hurry. We all know what a bail out is its when the government hands the insolvent bank a big bag of tax payer money. A bail IN is a new thing that's where the bank simply seizes depositors assets. If you put your money in a bank, it can be stolen BY THE BANK, and that is now legal. It happened in Cyprus in 2012 that was a test run. Its now legal EU wide and I believe in the US as well. I've heard people say "that'll never happen". It already did happen. They did it once, got away with it, and have expanded their authority to do it again on a larger scale. 
You cannot have a bail in with bitcoin and I think people will look to that as a safe haven FROM banks.
2. Inflation. All currency loses value over time, because the government keeps printing it. Bitcoin is hard capped at 21 million it cannot be inflationary. Bitcoin is volatile because it is young and small, that will iron out over time. So, given the choice between a currency that loses 3% per year, and a currency that gains 3% per year, which one would you use?
@_date: 2014-11-16 12:41:40
Same I started buying mid 2013. I've got a decent handful of bitcoins now and I'm hanging on to them like grim death.

But you said it yourself they are closely tied. A lot of the current economic problems stem from the problems with the money itself. Inflation, hyperinflation, national debts, currency controls, bail outs, bail ins, these are all massive problems with fiat currency. 
The could get away with it because you had no choice. The government had a monopoly on the currency, therefore you had to just suck it up. That's what bitcoin is it is choice. If the fiat system goes down the drain, you have another option, rather than being nailed to the mast of a sinking ship. Right now inflation in some South American nations is pushing 50% annually, wouldn't you say that an alternative is necessary for them?
@_date: 2014-12-21 12:26:18
A lot of people, even libertarians and ancaps (I'm a proud anarcho-capitalist myself), think that we need to get away from the libertarian anti-government anti-Federal reserve anti-fiat money welfare/warfare state rhetoric in order for bitcoin to be successful. That to me is really warped because it implies we're the crazy ones for being opposed to such an immoral system.
Rather than dial the libertarian side of bitcoin down I think we have to campaign with it. If you use bitcoin you are, consciously or not, making a bet against the current system. Its an opt-out.
I think we should run on that. The fact that bitcoin is completely outside of the mainstream fiat banking system is not a handicap its its greatest asset.

The blockchain is only valuable if it is mined, which serves the dual purposes of validating new transactions, and maintaining the integrity of the network. If bitcoin's value was 0, no one would mine it. The blockchain and bitcoin are 2 sides of the same coin trying to separate one from the other is a cop out.
@_date: 2014-12-26 10:32:50
To be technically accurate you do not actually hold bitcoin in a wallet, what you hold are the private keys. The easiest way to think of it is a wallet is just 2 codes; one in, one out. You have one code which is your public address that is strictly one way it only allows bitcoin in. The second code is how you get it out again that's the one you need to keep secret.
There are different kinds of wallets obviously. For a laptop or a desktop I use multibit its a very simple desktop client. When you create a wallet you save a .dat file which is your backup. You can load that wallet on another device by transferring the .dat file to another computer and using the "import private key" feature. The .dat IS the private keys.
As for securing it you can password protect the wallet which gives you 2 factor authentication. I find this is secure enough for general purposes.
For long term secure storage of large holdings you do what is called "cold storage". These are private keys generated completely offline so there is no digital trace of them anywhere near an online system. I use paper wallets what I did is got a 10 year old laptop (it doesn't even have wifi) and printed out a bunch of wallets while not plugged in to the internet (that laptop will never touch the internet ever again) so the private keys are printed on paper, on a system that was not connected to the internet which means those keys are guaranteed to be completely secure.
Even then you can still add a 2 factor authentication. That's what I do with paper wallets I print multiple copies of the same wallet and entrust them to family members in case I ever lost my own copy, but even if a family member went rogue and tried to rob me, they couldn't redeem the funds because when you enter the private key it still asks you for a password.
I find this is the best way to securely store large amounts long term just go low tech, print the private keys on paper using a paper wallet generator in an offline system (or Ubuntu if you are technically skilled), password protect them and put them in a safe.
@_date: 2014-11-23 14:20:29
First of all, you need a wallet to hold your coins. You can install one on your smartphone (OK for small amounts) or use Multibit on your laptop or desktop. It will ask you to say a .dat file. Keep that that's your private key back up.
Now, you want to buy some bitcoin. You can buy from coinbase, or another user. Here in the UK I use bitbargain I just buy using my online banking. Just find an exchange you like and stick with it, and send those coins out to the wallet on your desktop or whatever (don't keep them on the website).

If you want to transfer a $10 million USD internationally using a bank, you're looking at fees probably between $300,000 and half a million. With bitcoin the fee is literally a few cents. That's who would use bitcoin to transfer millions of dollars, those crazy people who want to save themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:39:38
Simply put its asymmetric by design. Its easy to reconstruct a public key from a private key, the private key contains all the information you need. But if that went both ways, then I could just go on to "bitcoin rich list", take the top address and reconstruct the private key from that, and withdraw the money.
That's why its asymmetric you can construct the public key from the private key, but not the other way around. The public key doesn't have enough information to reconstitute the private key.
If they existed as a 1 to 1 ratio they would have to be the same length, and the reconstruction would work equally well in either direction. It has to be asymmetric, and astoundingly so, to ensure security.

The blockchain. In order to have value something has to be useful and limited. Air is useful, but essentially unlimited, so its free. The blockchain is an immutable, decentralised, public ledger that records absolutely everything that happens on it ever. That has ENORMOUS utlity, and the well known cap of 21 million coins means it is limited. Hence, bitcoin has value
@_date: 2015-01-23 09:29:20
I find debates about volatilty tedious. Its just not a problem. For us early investors, we want volatility we want the price to go up. For those who wants stability, that will come in time. If bitcoin had 2 billion users and a 5 trillion dollar market cap then volatility would be almost zero. It would just get "averaged out" over 2 billion people instead of 5 million which it is today. So I think volatility will just naturally taper off if we just keep doing what we're doing.

Its true. Bitcoin has its booms and busts. Fiat just has busts. Bitcoin lost a bit more of its value (percentage wise) than the Russian Ruble, but the value of bitcoin might (and in my opinion probably will) go up again. Who thinks the value of the Ruble will go back to what it was this time last year? Exactly.
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:00:08
To be clear the actual bitcoin network has not been hacked, and can probably never be. Its too big at this point. The areas that tend to get hacked are the points of centralisation i.e. exchanges like BitStamp and the old MtGox. Centralisation is basically a giant bullseye for hackers. It is also antithetical to bitcoin itself it is by design DEcentralised which is why it hasn't been hacked. These points of centralisation tend to spring up, and inevitably get hacked because they suffer from the same vulnerabilities as regular banks.
In the end I think the decentralised ethos of bitcoin will win because its just better. Bitcoin is already decentralised, and eventually things like exchanges will be too.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:03:19
How does that make sense? Bitcoin is down, but its fixed supply mean it has a chance of going back up again. The Ruble is down, and its chances of going back up are zero. Bitcoin is a roller coaster but fiat currencies just consistently go down, down, down. So what's the better investment the one that has a 5% chance of appreciating in value or the one that has 0% chance?

Well if bitcoin went up in value 10x, that's a drastic benefit. I'm assuming you mean it would be worth millions and you could just retire. I'd say at least 2 or 3. I basically work on the assumption that within 20 years one BTC will be roughly equivalent to a million US dollars today. You could retire on $2-3 million.
I stopped obsessively buying when I reached exactly 21 BTC. One one millionth of all of the bitcoins that will ever exist. Seems like a nice round number. And if bitcoin did go to a million per coin, what's the difference really between 21 million and 25 million? Or 30 million? It reaches a point where you've just got more money than you know what to do with.

No bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places you can literally have 0.00000001 bitcoins in your wallet (although that would be worth about 1/10,000th of 1 penny), but its easily divisible you can buy $10 worth which are current exchange rates would be 0.04 bitcoins or something like that.
Little bit of advice to the noobs is start small. Open lots of wallets, and try sending small amounts of bitcoin back and forth until you get the feel for it before committing large sums.

Btw do not waste your time with faucets they are a con they pay out tiny, and I mean TINY, amounts of bitcoin. If you actually used one non-stop 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, you might actually have 1 whole bitcoin in about 350,000 years.

Sellers still outnumber bargain hunters. The bottom will be struck when we reach an equilibrium point; when the sellers have sold and the price is low enough that even sceptical buyers take the risk because its a chance to buy dirt cheap bitcoin.

Doubtful. This isn't even the worst crash bitcoin has ever had. In 2011 the price bombed from $32 to $2. As it dropped below $5 everyone was saying this was the end of bitcoin and it would soon be worth zero.
If we take the absolute all time high of bitcoin ($1204) then the price has to get down to about $75 to match the 2011 crash. Even if we go to $75 soon, we're still not in as bad shape as we were in 2011 because bitcoin is a much more mature animal today than it was then in terms of infrastructure, acceptance and recognition.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:21:21
Yes and no. A lot of transactions are "false" transactions' transactions where you are just moving your own bitcoins between addresses you own. For example you have a large amount in your smartphone wallet and you send those coins to your cold storage for safe keeping. Basically you've moved money from your left pocket to your right pocket its not economic growth for the bitcoin economy but it still gets counted under "transaction volume".

I top up my "liquid" bitcoins about once a month. I never have that much on me probably $50 worth at most.
@_date: 2015-01-31 16:42:30
I'll tell you exactly what I did to secure my bitcoin (I actually asked the reddit community to rate how secure they thought it was apparently its as secure as it gets)
1. Got a very old laptop (I had one lying around, its so old it doesn't even have wifi). This computer will now never again connect to the internet.
2. Downloaded a paper wallet generator from bitcoinpaperwallet.com. 
3. Loaded said generator on said laptop using a usb stick (again it will never be used again).
4. Since these wallets are being generated on a computer that is not and never will connect to the net they are guaranteed "cold" private keys.
5. Generate 1 paper wallet, and add a BIP38 encryption passphrase. This is a 2 factor authentication which means even if you have the private key, you also need a password to redeem the bitcoins.
6. Print 5 copies of the same wallet (so the key and password is the same for every one).
7. Laminate them using an kind of acrylic spray (few bucks out of any hardware store) put them in an envelope, and then seal them in a plastic ziplock wallet.
8. Put one in my fireproof safe at home. Distribute the other 4 at other locations or with trusted family members as backups (even if they went "rogue" and tried to rob me, the key is useless without the password).
I know this sounds involved and I have gone "full Batman" on the security measures here but I have a not insubstantial stash of coins now so I am taking zero chances. In all this took me less than an hour to do.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:12:24
Darkest before the dawn? This had to happen but I think this crash of crashes will signal the end of the relentless 13 month decline. The Gods of Bitcoin are testing us. You just need to hang in there a bit longer. Look at it this way, if bitcoin can survive this crash it can survive anything.
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:24:49
I doubt its such a 1:1 correlation between increase in transaction volume and increase in user base, but I am treating my bitcoins as a long term investment. Bitcoin as a transactional currency will come naturally as it matures. Right now, its a speculative investment for those who can stomach the high volatility. I've got a few bitcoins (more than 10 less than 100) and they are staying in cold storage for at least 10 years. If bitcoin managed to get to 2 billion users it would have to be worth hundreds of times its current value so am I hell going to part with them now.
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:28:04
No. The no. 1 rule is always assume that your computer is hacked. If you have a wallet on your computer to hold all of your bitcoins then you have to consider if you can retrieve the bitcoins if your computer simply stops working, is stolen, or lost in a fire etc. Also, you are connected to the internet, which means your wallet is connected to the internet. I use desktop wallets but only for small amounts.
For large amounts what you can do is print a wallet out on paper from an offline computer. Send the bitcoins to that, that way you can be assured there is no digital copy of your private key lying around on an internet connected system.
Just don't lose that bit of paper keep it in a safe or something.
If you want to be Batman, do what I do. Print a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet so that you need the key AND a password, and print a few copies and leave them in various locations so if you ever lose one you're not totally boned. 
If anyone ever found one, they still can't get the money because you still need a password.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:11:58
I think the answer is even simpler than that. After the MtGox fiasco which inflated the price to bubble level madness, the price had to come back down, but to what? No one knows what the actual market price should be.
I think this is the market testing bitcoin to destruction. We have to find the absolute low before we can even think about setting new highs. This is a hard reboot of the price mechanism. I don't know where it will bottom out, but it will, and that will mark the end of the year long bear market.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:58:04
When the price is setting higher lows like it is now, buy on the corrections. Every price spike will usually retrace 60-70% of its gains.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:46:40
Yeah I'd say in the $100 to $120 range. It was around $120 before the mega spike in Oct/Nov 2013 so I think if it manages to go below that $120 mark it will only do so only slightly and very briefly.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:22:14
HODL! Bitcoin will survive this. The price will probably keep going lower but I'll eat my hat (and the 12 BTC I have accumulated this year) if the price goes to zero. So many people are holding or using it as a buying opportunity.

@_date: 2015-01-26 12:11:33
I had a similar problem. What I did was uninstall the Bitcoin QT and delete the blockchain data, then reinstall it and download the blockchain from scratch then import the wallet. Its a total pain in the ass takes about a week to sync up, but when I imported the wallet it showed the right balance. Worked for me I hope it works for you.

"Jumping the shark" means something has peaked and is now on the decline in terms of quality. These points essentially all make the same point which is that bitcoin has a lot of growing up to do and there is some expectation of improving quality in the future.

@_date: 2015-01-28 21:37:55
You wouldn't have to burn any bitcoin to do a contract like that. Say I'm buying a house from you, and its 1 BTC (this is 10 years from now when a bitcoin is $500,000), I wouldn't have to send 1 BTC and then burn an extra 0.0000001 to log the contract in the blockchain, that's wasteful that's 2 transactions where 1 would do. The contract would be part of the same transaction the contract is still logged in the blockchain forever even if you then go on to spend the bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:34:20
I think its weathered the storm. Past tense. I think what we're seeing now is a change in the winds. It crashed to $170, and I think we can call the bottom of the decline. The market has established a hard floor, and that marks the end of the year long reign of the bear, and now we can start to look upwards again. The worst has past and we are (cautiously) heading into a bull market.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:32:12
The market doesn't turn on news, that's why the price only spiked for a few hours when PayPal announced bitcoin integration, and only about $10 briefly when Microsoft backed it. News just doesn't affect the price aside from short lived blips.
The good news is good news though because what it is is a promise. All the money that's flowing into bitcoin start ups, $75 million into coinbase, well 2-3 years from now they're going to start bearing fruit, and adding value to the network and that will increase the price. The VC money flowing into bitcoin does nothing just now, because these start ups aren't contributing yet, but once they are then they are adding value.
I don't even expect we'll breach $1000 in 2015, but 2016-2018, with the maturing infrastructure and "the halvening" (block rewards dropping to 12.5 BTC) I think will be very interesting. So 2017 I'd definitely call the moon guy.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:15:58
I was thinking the same thing myself. I was thinking of this as a system wide reboot of the price. After the MtGox fiasco, the market did not know what the price should be. This is the market testing the price to destruction, in order to rediscover the "true" price. Its the market trying to get back on an even keel after being out of whack for a over a year, and the best way to do that is a hard reset. This is healthy and necessary.
That's why I'm going to hodl and just ride out this storm...and maybe relieve panic sellers of their coins.

I did something similar for my cousin's son. The wee guy is the first of the "next generation" since after him the next youngest member of the family is 26. I got him 0.25BTC a while ago and stuck it on a paper wallet which I gave to his dad. He's to get it on his 25th birthday, and he's not to know about it before then. My hope is that he'll be mature enough by then to put what I hope will be a 6 figure sum to good use.
Bitcoin has such potential its probably a once in a century opportunity. By the time the little ones grow up it'll have passed, but we can get them ground floor shares if we act now.

I wouldn't trust an electronic device to live that long. I've had enough USB sticks break on me to know better. Here is what I do (paranoia level: "Batman"). I have a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet generated on a 100% offline system so you need the private key (printed on paper) and a password. I print multiple copies of the same wallet. They are kept in a cling film wrapped envelope in a plastic ziplock wallet, and I keep one for myself in a safe. The others I leave with trusted family members in case I ever lose mine (due to theft or fire etc). If a family member ever "went rogue" and tried to rob me, they still can't redeem the money because they need the password. There's only one other person alive who knows the password so they can access the bitcoins in the event of my death (assuming they are not directly responsible for it). That's probably overkill, but I do think my stash will be worth a fortune in 10 years so I am taking zero chances.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:22:30
I've been buying continuously since $850. The lower it goes, the more I buy. I'm HODLING and anyone who wants my bitcoins can pry them from my cold dead talons.
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:04:05
I would invest now. Prices have been dropping pretty much non-stop for about 13 months but I think that's it bottoming out now. It went to $160 and bounced back up about $50 within hours so I think we've established an absolute minimum at long last. I'd just buy now rather than wait and see if it drops to $180-190, it doesn't really matter.
Will bitcoin be around in 2030 I have no idea and no one does. That's 15 years away that would be a bit like asking me back in 2000 to predict the invention of bitcoin.

Yes if you try to leave the dollar the US Empire will strike back, but an empire is an expensive thing to run. Its somewhat self perpetuating they need the dollars to fund the war machine to force everyone to stay on the dollar which funds the war machine.
This is fundamentally a losing game because it gets harder and harder to do each time. They took down Saddam, cost them $6 trillion but they did it, then they took down Qadaffi, but what about the next one? And the one after that? It becomes a game of whack-a-mole where countries are fleeing the dollar faster than the rapidly crumbling US empire can force them back on to it, and every one they loss further inhibits their ability to combat the next one because the dollar is haemorrhaging value.
This really could be a bloodless coup where countries switch to the superior (and above all, politically neutral) bitcoin and the US is too damn broke to do anything about it.

But that assumes the miners sell 100% of what they mine. As the price drops the industrial razor thin profit margin mining operations will have to shut up shop, difficulty drops and then it becomes economical for smaller "mine to hold" miners to enter the market.
@_date: 2015-01-23 11:40:07
So? All that means is the remaining bitcoins are more valuable. Even if 20 million bitcoins were lost, the system would still work just as well with the remaining 1 million. Its just an arbitrary number. Losing bitcoins will become much less common as 1. the value rises 2. infrastructure improves and things like storage become more user friendly.

I seriously doubt this was the work of a few bearwhales. I've been expecting the price to drop for the past 2 weeks I've seen this pattern 3 times before in bitcoin. Spike, drop, recover but not as high as the spike, then drop again. 
We had a spike to 500, a drop, a recovery to the mid-400's, and now its dropped again. I'm expecting another drop and then a period of calm before the price starts taking a run up for the big event in August.

I don't buy it any more but I bought a load of it as a speculative asset. Buy, hold, forget, see what its worth in 10 or 15 years. If the price goes to zero it goes to zero I'll swallow the loss. If it works, I'm laughing all the way to the bank.

Its pretty straight forward. A bear is someone who thinks they should be selling bitcoin because the price is going to go down, and a "bear market" or "bearish sentiment" means falling prices. A bull is the opposite they are someone who thinks you should buy because prices will rise.
Whale is a term for a BIG trader. Someone who has enough of that asset to single handedly cause market moves.
"Bearwhale" and "bullwhale" are really just joke terms among bitcoiners its just us having fun, but it basically all it means is a really big buyer or a really big seller.

I'm not saying its a fetish I'm saying it has become *fetishised*. Bitcoin is and must remain decentralised but I think that this has been taken to a point where maximum decentralisation above all else has become the calling. Like I said it just has to be decentralised enough.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:59:29
In my opinion decentralisation has become a fetish. We've become obsessed with maximum decentralisation above all else. We have tunnel vision. Bitcoin doesn't need to be decentralised to some ideal extreme, it just has to be decentralised *enough*.
Yes a thousand transactions per second would take up bandwidth, so much so that it would monopolise a typical household connection. So what? All that would mean is that running full nodes is typically restricted to either bitcoin orientated businesses, programmers, or interested hobbyists, because these are the kinds of people who would pay for extra bandwidth to do this.
That's still pretty decentralised. 5 million full nodes is more decentralised than 500,000, but 500,000 is still pretty decentralised. It would seem to me that there is a law of diminishing returns here, you reach a certain point where going "more decentralised" just doesn't really have much benefit since its already plenty decentralised.

Faucets are a waste of time. The payouts are absolutely tiny. Seriously if you are getting 500 satoshi every 10 minutes if you did that 40 hours a week it would take you something like 17 years to get 1 bitcoin.

Mining is not for you. Mining is not something you can do with a desktop computer. You could 5 years ago, but by design mining gets exponentially harder. 
Today to mine bitcoin you need 1. some pretty serious technical expertise and 2. industrial grade hardware which is *not* cheap (we're talking thousands of dollars).
Its just not something a newbie can do. If you want to get into bitcoin, just buy some. That's what I did I set up a cold storage wallet (think of it as a digital offline vault), and transferred all of my bitcoins to it. Now my master strategy is to just forget about it and see what its worth in 10 or 12 years.
Spending $5,000 on ASIC miners and then another $5,000 in electricity costs (ASICS are absolute *hogs*) just to mine $10,100 worth of bitcoin...its not worth it. 
Buy, hold, try not to think about it and see what its worth a few years from now.

There is BTCJam but avoid like the plague. I invested a bit just to see if it would make any (the bill it as being 10 to 14% returns annually depending on what risk plan you choose) but the default rate is horrendous. Probably almost half of borrowers never pay back a penny which completely wipes out any returns you hope to make.
I've stopped all of mine just waiting on the last payments coming back so I can withdraw the balance. I'll be glad if I get back what I put in but more likely I'll have made a loss.

I'm actually bearish I expect it to drop below $400 over the next month or two. I don't think it will go below $350.
This is a pattern we've seen before in bitcoin several times there's a spike, then a bounce which doesn't set a new high, then a decline.
We've had a spike, then a bounce, now we'll decline but probably not very far, followed by a period of not much happening price wise until it starts ramping up again as the block reward halving draws near.

The £100 weekly buy strategy would probably be the best. This allows you to average out your buy-in price. If you buy 10 BTC right now, and the price drops $50, you are instantly down $500. By the same token you would be up $500 if it went up $50, but then that's just a coin toss.
If the price of a bitcoin is £300 just now and you buy £100 worth, that's 0.3 BTC. Next week £100 buys you 0.4 BTC. Week after that? 0.5 BTC. Week after that? 0.6. Week after that? 0.7.
As you can see, the price here is going down. But you started buying at £300, it would now be £142, and your average buy price would be £200 per coin (so you would be down only £145, compared to almost £400 had you bought the whole lot at £300).
Basically buying fixed amounts (whatever £100 gets you every Friday for example) keeps your average buy much closer to the current price (thus controlling risk) rather than simply buying in bulk and hoping for the best.
@_date: 2016-01-01 13:17:26
It will in a sense cause a drop in supply. It will not reduce the total number of bitcoins, but it will reduce the number of bitcoins for sale. For example I have a stash of bitcoins in cold storage, and they are staying there come hell or high water. As far as the market is concerned, they might as well not exist.
The market is really only composed of liquid bitcoins. Those that are hoarded and locked away don't really count.
Since most miners have to sell most of what they mine in order to cover costs, the halving will reduce the supply of new liquid bitcoins flooding into the market.

Do not invest more than you could stomach to lose. If you put $1000 into bitcoin today, and June next year its worth $0, would that be a loss you could not live with? If not, then don't invest.
But you are 18 so I'm assuming you aren't married/kids/mortgage etc. so you probably could afford to take a chance and buy 2 bitcoins.
We are in a bull market right now but if you are going to invest, think long term. If you bought a couple of bitcoins, put them in cold storage (offline private keys) until you are 30. Don't pay attention to day-to-day price swings.
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:51:04
Its pretty simple. You don't, strictly speaking, hold bitcoins. Bitcoins never leave the blockchain they only move from address to address on the blockchain. In fact, if you download the entire blockchain, you can have all ~16 million currently mined bitcoins on your computer.
What you actually hold when you own bitcoin is *private keys*. The address is public, but in order spend from that address you need another, longer, code called a private key. This is how you exercise ownership over your bitcoins you don't hold the coins themselves you hold access codes.
All paper wallets are is the private keys printed on paper rather than stored digitally on a computer where a hacker might get them.

OK but what use is that? What does 1 bitcoin buy me? 6 eggs? A nice watch? A BMW? Saying "1 BTC = 1 BTC" doesn't tell you anything useful it doesn't tell you what it's worth. Measuring it against US or something is more useful because I know what $600 will buy me.

I just use bitaddress.org. Download it, run it from an offline computer. There's a tickbox on it to BIP38 encrypt so tick it and add a password.
The security isn't really in the password. The security is in the private keys. BIP38 is an absolute last line of defence basically even if someone broke into my house. Even if they found a copy of my paper wallet (a minor miracle), they cannot redeem the funds. At least not right away. Some password cracker could brute force it eventually but it buys me time.
In such an eventuality, I would get another copy of my paper wallet and redeem the funds and move them to a new address purely as a matter of course. Encrypted or not, I'm not having cold storage wallets out there unaccounted for.

I use paper wallets printed from an old laptop I keep offline. I BIP38 encrypt them, make multiple copies, and keep them in cleaned out oregano jars.
Private keys are offline. The jars are airtight, and hard to find. If someone did find them, they are password protected. If my house burns to the ground, I have off-site backups.
It doesn't get any more secure than that.

I hope so, but I think we have to face the fact that we might be stuck &lt;$400 for another 12 months. We're heading into deflation and commodities get hit hard. I do believe that this deflation will, ironically, trigger a hyperinflation we just need to get through the deflation first, so lets all urge patience. And maybe tone the rhetoric regarding the XT fork we'll just see what happens.

Well that's fine too. That's my point; which regions will be affected and how due to bandwidth issues or cents per kW/h should not be a factor in decisions concerning the core implementation. Make the changes that need to be made, and the miners wherever they are will have to adapt. Rather than the network adapting to them.
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:03:13
Any number of ways, and probably some combination of all of them. People could start spending more, feeling more secure financially (decide to buy that new car after all, that sort of thing). A bank could go under, releasing the backed up money to any number of creditors. Or more likely simply enough time will pass that the banks no longer need the money for its original purpose; making them look, on paper, solvent. If that happens they will loan it out that's what a bank does. The problem there is that once its done that its no longer under the bank's control to a certain extent. If the bank invests in X and X goes belly up, all that money goes *somewhere*.
Velocity is just a measure of how often money changes hands. Rising prices (colloquially called "inflation" although not strictly accurate) is a result of increasing money supply * velocity. All of that QE money in effect does not exist. Its not in the general economy its quarantined. Which is why we haven't had inflation, and are even going the other way. But it will one way or another make its way into the general economy its not just going to sit there until the end of time.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:50:17
I'm getting fed up of this "block size causes decentralisation" argument. Yes if bitcoin was as big as visa (about 20,000 transactions per second) then the blockchain would increase in size about 100 terabytes a year. This is not going to happen tomorrow. Or next week or even next year.
In 15 years yeah bitcoin may be processing 20,000 transactions per second and on that day I'll have a picobyte of memory on my smartphone. Moore's law ensures that we will remain ahead of the blockchain's growth. I was on the internet 15 years ago I remember downloading 320p MTV music videos. A file was about 35MB and took about 5-6 *hours* to download. Even a low quality mp3 took 15-20 minutes (file size about 3MB). Today my internet is literally 10,000 times faster, and it will be 10,000 times faster again in 15 years when we have 1GB blocks and it won't be a problem.
I'm all for alternative solutions but we don't have all the time in the world here. Bitcoin is growing up. Fast. We're already bumping up against the 1MB limit and we don't have time to debate a theoretical solution that might be available 1, 2 or 5 years from now, even if that solution is superior. All that will happen is that the world will pass bitcoin by.
@_date: 2015-08-23 12:18:52
Its impossible to predict so a good strategy is just make monthly buys. Take $100, or whatever you are willing to put in, and buy as much as that gets you. As the price goes down, you get more bitcoin for the same $100, which pulls your average down. Rather than reading tea leaves and trying to call the bottom, just keep buying and you should average out fairly close to it.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:57:48
This is probably going to be implemented someday soon. Must nodes would only have the last half million blocks or so (which is longer than the total blockchain right now but remember Moore's law) and only miners or other technically inclined parties would run "archival nodes" that go all the way back to the genesis block. There would still be hundreds or thousands of these "archival nodes" so its still decentralised, and for most purposes the last 10 years is going to be sufficient.
@_date: 2015-08-24 20:27:44
Its only a closed loop if that QE money never enters the economy. It will, sooner or later (probably sooner) and then the inflation will kick in. 
Rising prices require 2 things 1. an increase in the money supply. Check. QE pretty much quadrupled it and 2. velocity.
That's the reason QE never worked in the first place. The government prints and velocity *slows*, cancelling out the inflationary effects of the money printing. But all that money is still there, and when velocity picks up all that pent up inflation (for want of a better analogy) is going to be unleashed.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:43:28
But the 8MB limit is a *limit*, it does not automatically mean all blocks will be 8MB. If blocks are coming in at 8MB it means they are being filled up with transactions. If China cannot keep up with that, then tough tits for China.
That would not be a failing of bitcoin that would be a failing of China. Bitcoin is getting to the stage where it needs more capacity. OK so...it needs more capacity. Decisions have to be made in the best interests of bitcoin itself, not the miners based in any particular country.

"The dollar is still in high demand"
I think that could very well be what kills it. I think that as the Yuan, the Yen, the Thai Bhat and probably soon the Euro get into the mad rush to the bottom of a currency war, the US dollar could end up being the last man standing.
Which would be a good thing for the US dollar, and Americans. Which is why the government is going to screw it up. If dollar demand goes up as a "safe haven" while the Asian and European markets devalue their currencies, then the dollar becomes strong relative to these other currencies. I reckon the US dollar would be devalued too.
I don't think (and this is just my opinion) it will take decades. I think its taken us decades to get to this point, but its all downhill in a hurry from here.
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:41:28
I think its because we're heading into deflation. Deflation is a  good thing. Its a big boogeyman for banks and governments, which is why they want you to think its bad, but really all it means is that prices fall. Do you go to the pump and say "damn, the price of gas is *down* again I hate it when it does that"?
That's why gold, silver and bitcoin are all down. They're not down, they are just down relative to the dollar. Dollar has gone up while bitcoin has stayed roughly the same.
Austrian economists have been predicting this deflation since at least 2010, and they also predict that it will be short lived. Banks are sitting on an *in*flation time bomb. All that QE money, its still there. The reason we can have deflation with all that QE money is because its locked away. Sooner or later, it will break out into the economy at large and we will swing back the other way from mildly deflationary, to hyper inflationary.
This deflation could last months, maybe a year, but it will not last for years it can't. Remember deflation punishes debtors, and who is the biggest debtor? The government. They will have to push us back towards inflation, and its not going to work, so they will push harder, and harder, and harder, until it snaps and buries the needle in the other direction.
This deflation is just something we're going to have to get through, but get through it we will, and when the economy spirals into hyperinflation (which is defined as 30%+ per year) *then* bitcoin will look very attractive indeed.

This is what I did. I'm like you I'm hanging on to my bitcoin stash (more than 10 less than 100) for the minimum the next 5 years. Realistically probably more like 10-12 years. So I wanted absolute peace of mind. So here's the steps:
1. I dug out an old laptop that I never use (seriously this thing is like 12 years old). If you don't have one, might be worthwhile buying one for $50 if we're talking about securing thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin here.
2. Go on to bitaddress.org, download the paper wallet generator.
3. Disconnect your wi-fi. This laptop will never connect to the internet again. For security I just unplug my modem and never have the 2 running at the same time.
4. Run bitaddress offline and create a paper wallet. 
5. Password protect the wallet with BIP38 encryption (just tick the box). Make the password hard to guess but easy to remember. Like your dog's name and the year you got him.
6. Print 5 copies of the *same* wallet.
7. Seal them in envelopes put them in ziplock bags or whatever, and distribute to trusted family and friends who do not live in the same household.
That's what I did, I kept 2 at home and give the other 3 away for safe keeping. If I was ever burgled and a paper wallet stolen, I have back ups at other locations, and its useless to the burglar anyway since he cannot redeem the funds without the password.
If that actually happened, I would simply as a security precaution move the bitcoins to a new cold wallet.
So there's no 3rd party custody of the keys here, and no chance of a bug since its paper its not a flash drive. No single point of failure, and if you get burgled its useless to them even if they find it.
The only downside here is if you die, you take your password to the grave with you. That's why I entrusted mine to my brother. He's the only other person alive who can access my bitcoins, but then I know his passphrase. The idea being if anything ever happened, the surviving brother could retrieve the bitcoins for the family.

I call it violence backed currency, because that's what it is. People say fiat is not backed with anything (that anything used being gold) however it absolutely is backed with something; its backed with a gun.
Fiat is the only form of money you can pay your taxes in, and you have to pay your taxes, otherwise they'll come for you, which means you have to acquire fiat currency.
So yeah lets call it what it is; violence backed currency.

Bitcoin will end. Adoption is picking up, slowly but surely. I can't remember exactly how many transactions it takes to fill a 1MB block but we're getting close to that now. Lets say its 1000, doesn't matter its just to illustrate a point.
If we start going over that, the network will crash. No one will be able to transact on the network you'll just get the equivalent of "Error 404". So people will just stop using bitcoin. Users will just drop to zero and that will be the end of that.
What I'm afraid will happen is that adoption will continue to creep up while we debate the block size, until it crosses the point were it is consistently exceeding the block capacity and the network fails and that's the end of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-20 22:54:30
I'm not sure if that's technically possible. I can't remember the exact reason why but 21 million BTC isn't arbitrary it was chosen for a specific reason. 21 quadrillion (the number of satoshis that will ever exist) is close to some inherent capacity limit in the mathematics of bitcoin's code. Something to do with a 64 bit number I forget the rest of the details.

Right now its best just using £££. I have bitcoin, but its locked away in cold storage. I don't plan on spending any of it for 10 years.
For must purposes, the pound is good enough. We're a minority. In somewhere like Venezuela, where inflation is at 800% per month (so basically every month your money is worth 1/8th what it was last month), you don't need to convince them bitcoin is better.
Bitcoin is not really about us (although we can hold it as a speculative investment) its about the rest. Billions of people in the world live under tyrannical governments with hyper-inflationary currencies, or they are 100 miles from the nearest bank.
At the end of the day though, every fiat (government) currency that has ever existed has died. It would be folly to think that 800% inflation could not happen in the UK. In fact I'm fairly certain it will happen in the US fairly soon (next few years), and the UK is so far up the US' ass it could take us with it so, can't be too careful.

He knows the passphrase but doesn't have a copy of the wallet, nor does he know who in the family has the wallet. So if he really did try to rob me, he'd have to ask around to see who has a copy, and then convince that person to join him in the robbery. Not that he would ever do that, but if he did then I'm going to find out pretty quickly that he's been asking around.

1. Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitfinex etc these are all exchanges. Basically a bitcoin brokerage. They are on-ramps into bitcoin they offer places to trade bitcoin for conventional currency and vice versa. You don't have to use these though you can trade p2p in person.
2. "Wallet" is a terrible name. Its a keychain. You do not hold bitcoin, strictly speaking. The coins themselves never leave the bitcoin network. They only move from network address to network address. What "wallets" actually hold are *access codes*, called private keys. Some wallets are hosted on websites, and to use exchanges you probably will have to open one on the exchange, but you can download a smartphone app and use that as a wallet, or even print them on paper.
3. Multi-sig I think. Multi-sig is a pretty cool idea it means rather than 1 private key to unlock the funds, you need m of n keys to unlock the funds, such as 2 out of 3, or 5 out of 7. For example a married couple might put their joint life savings in a 2 of 2 wallet, and hold one each. That way the funds can only be unlocked when they both agree.

What I don't understand is why this is such an issue. Even the holy Satoshi himself said that the 1MB block limit was only ever supposed to be a temporary kludge just to stop bitcoin being overwhelmed during the first few years. Even he intended for the block size to increase as adoption began to pick up. Block size goes up but then so does bandwidth and mass storage. In 10 years I'll be able to run the full blockchain with 10GB blocks on my Android. I really don't get why people have their panties in such a twist over what seems to be not only a totally natural development, but a positive one. We have to raise the block size limit because of more traffic on the network. Hurrah! It means adoption is increasing.

I think we've been in a bull trend since January, but a tentative one. The market is hesitant to advance after such a prolonged decline. I don't think this crash will go below ~$260. Rally, crash, established a new higher low. Rinse, repeat. That seems to be the pattern here its very slowly working its way up to going above $300 and staying there, which I'd say only has a 50/50 chance of happening before Christmas. MtGox did a lot of damage to bitcoin both in terms of price and reputation. I think we just need to accept that it might take a full 2 years to fully get over it.

Even if it did result in a drop off in full nodes being ran on laptops its still worth it. "Decentralisation" has become a fetish, and bitcoin is going to end up being strangled by it. Sacrificing bitcoin on the alter of maximum decentralisation is a bit self defeating. As bitcoin scales it is going to centralise a bit, and that's a compromise we just need to accept if we want it to scale to rival Visa, it only has to remain decentralised *enough*.

The thing is, XT isn't even the final word, there's nothing to say it cannot be updated again in future. The situation is that blocks are approaching capacity, and we're out of time. There is no working solution to this issue right now other than increasing the block size limit. Other solutions such as the lightning network are, for the moment, theoretical. We need solutions today, so that means raising the block size.
But 2-3 years from now solutions that do not involve raising the block size that are theoretical today, will be implementable then, and then we could discuss *lowering* the block size back to 1MB.
I support what Hearn and Gavin are doing because we've become so fixated on "consensus" that we've become paralysed by it. We will *never* all agree on everything, and we'll we bicker bitcoin dies on the vine.

I'd go with plan A. Investing in derivatives and ETF's means you don't own bitcoin. Remember number 1 rule of bitcoin is you hold private keys, you own bitcoin. You no hold private keys, you no own bitcoin. Physical collectible coins were a novelty and you're really paying for the "collectibleness". Think of it like buying bullion coins sure you could just buy standard silver eagles, or you could pay a lot more for a limited edition coin. But most people probably don't care about the collectible value they only care about the bullion value, and if the coins have the same mass it just means you are paying over the odds. Same with bitcoin.
Also, physical bitcoins have a serious flaw in them; the private key has to be printed on them by someone other than you. Which means they could have kept a copy of it.
My investment strategy was dump a load of coins in paper wallet that I made myself from an offline computer (so I know no one has ever seen that key), encrypted it, made a 5 copies kept 2 at home and asked various family members to hang on to the other 3 for me.
Buy, hold, forget. We'll see what the price is in 5 years.

Download a desktop client. I find Multibit to be the most straightforward, and create a wallet. You will be asked to save a .dat file. That is a copy of the wallet so save that to a flash drive or something. It means if your computer blew up, you can reconstruct your wallet (and the bitcoins) on another computer.
Do that, and download a simple wallet app for your smartphone. Buy $5 worth of bitcoin and practice sending bitcoins back and forth.
Do make a transaction you just scan the address code with your phone, saves you typing it, and hit "send". 
"Cold storage" is when you create offline wallets for long term storage. If your phone is petty cash, cold storage is your vault. If you have a lot of bitcoin and want to secure it (trading ease of access for security) then there are tutorials on how to do that.

The exact number is 20999999.9769 bitcoins, and the reason for that is the block halving. If you go 50, 25, 12.5, once every 4 years then in about 140 years you get to 1 satoshi and then its "mined out", leaving the total shown above.
Of course, this is only true if 1 bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places, which it currently is. So why 8? Why not 7 or 9? I think that might be a cheeky nod from Satoshi. If there are 10^8 satoshis to a coin, and one satoshi was equal to 1 US cent, then 1 bitcoin would be worth $1 million. He had high hopes, even then.

It is a good feeling isn't it, to own something that is so limited.

I think if we can get over the hump of the 300 dollar mark, it will be a psychological dam breaking. 300 seems to be a very significant number for the bitcoin price since it didn't breach it last time it tried.
If it goes above $300 this time, I think we'll see a massive spike maybe all the way up to almost $400, but then we'll see a natural and healthy correction in the market. However, I do think if it goes above the $300 mark, it will stay above the $300 mark permanently.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:09:21
I think "the big one" is still a couple of years away for a very simple reason. In 2014, half a billion dollars of start up money was poured into bitcoin. The figures for 2015 have *already* surpassed that, and we're only in July.
These start ups are what is going to make bitcoin go boom. Bitcoin is still by computer geeks for computer geeks. Its not user friendly. These start ups are going to be the ones to bring bitcoin mainstream and that's when it goes to infinity$$$ and beyond.
These start ups are not producing anything just now, because they just started. But in 2-3 years then all this VC investment is going to be bringing products to the market.
So while the current bull market is good for bitcoin, and I think we might even hit $1,000 again by Christmas, this is still small time. The "big one" is still a bit away, but not that far. 2017-2019 is going to be a very good time to be a bitcoin hodler.

You've probably heard the expression "when all you have is a hammer every problem must be a nail". I think that's the problem they have. Governments have exactly one tool; a big hammer. Control. That's all they can do, try to control the market. When that doesn't work, well the only tool they have is more control, so therefore "logically" the solution must be...more control!
It really is the definition of insanity. The actual solution here is for them to do nothing. Step back and let the market do its thing. Sure it will be painful, but a year or so the market will recover the market is a self correcting system. Leave it alone, and it will self correct. But that would mean giving up their control, their power, which is something they would never do willingly. It wouldn't even occur to them.

How much are you willing to risk? Even if bitcoin only goes up, that money is also locked away for now.

You realise those conditions are contradictory, right? You want to buy them with a debit card, *in your own name*, and still have the transaction not be traced to you?
If you want to buy anonymously, pay cash at a bitcoin atm. Import the paper wallet to a desktop client and then convert to darkcoin or something. The recipient can always change it back at their end.

I've been more into silver and bitcoin than gold, but if it goes below $1000 I'm buying.
The gold price has been declining for what? 4 years? Protracted bear markets always end in carnage. The same thing happened to bitcoin back in January when it just went off a cliff, down to about $170. That was the end of the post-MtGox decline. Notice how its been very gradually pushing higher since then.

A bitcoin "wallet" is basically 2 codes (this is not really technically accurate but it works well enough for a basic user). Your first code is your public address. Always starts with 1. That's the code you give out that's the code that people send the money to. If you download a bitcoin wallet smartphone app, then it will automatically generate a code like this for you.
This code is one way. It only allows money *in*. The second code is the private key. This is the code you keep secret, because this is the code that you use to get the money out again. Usually start with a 5, you won't see this code if you use a smartphone since its integrated in.
Probably the easiest way to buy bitcoins is in person. Meet a seller in a starbucks. Have them use their smartphone to scan the QR code on your smartphone, and within a few seconds the bitcoins will show up in your phone and you pay cash.
I would not *keep* bitcoins in your smartphone though. If you want to hodl long term, you can print your private keys out on paper, and keep it in a safe.

Lets make it really simple and say you and I split the blockchain 50/50. I have half, you have half. How do you know I have not tampered with my half, or vice versa? You don't. You can't. I have control over that part of the ledger you cannot know if I have altered it.
The point of bitcoin is that there is no trust. It eliminates the need for trust. We can all access a full copy of the blockchain, and that way if I alter mine, then it just does not match every other copy and is rejected. Every 10 minutes when a new block is found, every copy of the blockchain has to agree with every other copy with regard to previous blocks found.
What will likely happen in the distant future (30 years or more) is that most people will not need the full chain. You could run a partial node on your smartphone with say the last 1 million blocks, which is every transaction for the last 15 years. That will probably be a few dozen terabytes by this point, but I think by 2040 your smartphone will download that in a few minutes without breaking a sweat.
Nodes that run the full chain all the way back to 2009 will be archival nodes, run by places like Google, but there will still be hundreds or even thousands of these so its still decentralised.

MtGox went bust almost 2 years ago. When I said bitcoin went to 170 I was referring to the January 2015 crash. Go on to the Winkdex and look at the 1 year chart you see the price going down down down, and then finally off a cliff to ~170.
Even as an industrial metal gold is probably undervalued. Its the most malleable metal, and the most conductive (only superconductors have less resistance), so its used in high end lifestyle goods like smartphones, and demand for those is only going to go up, especially in the developing world since they are leapfrogging landlines, and you can get an android phone for $30 now.

That's increasing risk though. Now there are 3 single points of failure compared to my way which has none. Multi-sig is a great concept for some applications (a married couple keep their life savings in a 2 of 2 multisig wallet) but it's not necessarily better it comes with drawbacks as well.

Really simple. The Chinese stock market was pumped into a massive bubble by the central Chinese government. Its literally doubled in about one year. This looks good, for a while. They get to call it "growth", but its not economic growth its an economic cocaine rush caused by the government and central banks artificially pumping the stock market.
But like any drug high, now comes the come down. This artificial pump only works for so long it cannot go on forever, the market *will* self correct sooner or later. Which is what it just did. $3 trillion dollars (about 30%) drop, in just a couple of weeks, gone. It just crashed and burned.
So the government did what all governments do in a crisis; they made it worse. The government has frozen the stock market and made it illegal to sell your stocks (which if you think about it makes them absolutely worthless. Some solution!). So in effect, China does not *have* a stock market any more.
In a crisis, people look to commodities. Gold is the traditional example. Gold is a safe haven because if you have an ounce of gold in your hand, no matter what happens to the economy, an ounce of gold is an ounce of gold. Stocks are just digits on a screen, they can vanish in an instant. Money can be printed by the government until its worthless, or they can impose capital controls like they did in Greece where you can only withdraw 60 bucks at the ATM no matter how much you have in your account.
Bitcoin is a lot like gold in that regard because, like gold, it has fixed supply. Gold is limited by its natural abundance in the Earth's crust. Bitcoin is limited by the mathematics of the code.
So its viewed as a life raft. As the economy implodes around them people run to bitcoin because 21 million, and it cannot be shut down or confiscated. If people are losing money in the stock market, they'll put it into something they think will be safer. Something more "real", and bitcoin's digital nature doesn't mean its not real.

Yes a cold storage wallet is by definition one where the private key has never touched an online system. Consider using a paper wallet like breaking open a piggy bank.
Once used, its compromised. Spend what you have to spend and transfer the remainder to a fresh one.

The online dealer I use here in the UK actually does show an up to date spot price, and will even tell you how much of a premium over spot they are charging.

@_date: 2016-02-02 20:24:45
Just for the benefit of anyone who might be reading this who is looking for a simple but secure storage solution this is what I did:
The plan: I have a stash of bitcoins (more than 10 less than 100) and I have put them in cold storage, and they are staying in cold storage come hell or high water until at least 2024 (3 block reward halvings) and perhaps until after 2028 (4 halvings).
The solution: I dug out an old laptop I never use (its so old it doesn't even have wi-fi) and installed a paper wallet generator on it. This laptop will never connect to the internet again.
I generate a wallet, and encrypt it with a password using the BIP38 option. I print 5 copies of the *same* paper wallet. I seal them in envelopes which are in turn sealed in ziplock bags. I keep 2 in my house, and entrust the other 3 to family or very close friends, but tell no one the decryption passphrase.
I tell the decryption passphrase to one person (who does not themselves have a copy of the wallet or know for sure who does) with the instructions that if I ever die suddenly they are to redeem the money and spread it amongst the family.
So that is my super low tech solution to a high tech problem. My private keys are printed on paper, encrypted with a password, keep 2 and entrust 3 to other people who do not know the password so they cannot rob me if they tried. Even if my house burns to the ground, I have 3 back up copies spread over 100 miles.
Now, I wait...
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:24:30

I'm probably older than you. People won't have to understand bitcoin. That's kind of the problem; you need to understand it to some extent in order to use it. My mother has no idea how computers work, but she can use iTunes to download music. But it wasn't that long ago, 20 years maybe, that I was using IRC to download music and you needed to use dos command codes. I think bitcoin is still at that stage its by geeks for geeks and you need to be tech savvy to use it. A lot of R&amp;D is going to be going into inventing a "Windows 96" for bitcoin.
So that means people will be able to use bitcoin, the second part of that is why bother? Its obvious; economic turmoil. Countries like Argentina, where inflation is 30% per year, compounded, are not asking "why use bitcoin?". They want to know how to use bitcoin. They are already sold on the idea they just don't know how to work it. In 5 years we will not see bitcoin addresses any more. That's clunky. Its not user friendly. The actual 30 digit address should be "under the hood", and it will be.
It took the internet 20 years to go from you need to be a college level programmer to send an email, to your grandmother going "how did we ever live without this?". Bitcoin will do it faster because its using the internet to propagate itself. Its Moore's law you use one technology to speed up the invention of the next.

The laptop is a toaster its over a decade old. Still runs Windows XP. So the cost is zero. Or if you really wanted to buy a laptop just for that you could probably get some ancient piece of junk for $50 (cheaper than a trezor). No real trust involved like I said the paper wallet is encrypted, and they do not know the password, so the wallet is useless to them. The one person who does know the password is a very dear family member, who does not have a copy or know who does. So in order to rip me off my entire family would have to be involved in a grand conspiracy. I would be the Steven Avery of bitcoin.
Trezor is cool but my problem with that would be what if I lose the Trezor? Or it breaks? Single point of failure. I have multiple back ups of mine.

Buy it as an investment then. That's what I did. I've never spent bitcoin apart from small amounts I've given as gifts all my bitcoin is in cold storage (offline keys for secure long term holding).
Bitcoin is volatile because it has a $2 billion market cap and 5 million users. Its tiny. If it had 2 billion users and a 5 trillion dollar market cap it would be far more stable because all that volatility would be "averaged out". It'll stablise in time right now if you want to start using it just buy it as a long term speculative investment. I think that's the three stages of bitcoin 1. technical interest only 2. speculative investment 3. mature currency. We're barely out of stage 1.

"50 character password that is written down on a piece of paper next to your computer"
So in open view? Nice place to keep your password. I'll tell you exactly what I did, and this is super safe.
Printed out 5 copies of the SAME paper wallet from an offline computer that does not connect to the internet (I used a 12 year old laptop I had lying around). 
Password protect them with BIP38 using a human-friendly password. 
Put them in sealed (and foil wrapped) envelopes and kept 2 in my house, give the other 3 to family and friends who do not know the BIP38 passphrase.
Super simple. If a wallet is stolen, the coins cannot be redeemed without the passphrase (and if I knew one was stolen I would just create new wallets and move the coins to be extra safe)
If they were stolen by the state I'm still safe as 3 of the 5 copies are not in my house and I can just say I don't remember the passphrase. They can't prove otherwise.
@_date: 2015-09-25 16:56:08
My master plan is very straight forward. I have 25 BTC locked away in cold storage, and they are staying in cold storage come hell or high water. But I have a couple of extra BTC which I keep separately, not in a hot wallet, but more easily accessible.
What I plan to do is sell those extra ones for cash next time I think bitcoin is in a bubble (I don't mean a price spike of $50 I mean goes up 5x in the space of a month), and then use that money to buy my bitcoins back at the bottom. So sell 2, and buy back 10 at the bottom, put 5 into cold storage, sell the other 5 during the next bubble, buy back 20, put 10 in cold storage. You get the general idea.
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:41:52
To accept bitcoin all you need is a "wallet", which if you want to accept bitcoin from client's in person could be something as simple as a smartphone app. Download the app open the wallet and it will show a QR code. All someone has to do to send bitcoin to your phone is scan the QR code with their phone and voilà.
Obviously this is for basic transactions if you wanted to securely hold larger amounts don't hold it on your phone but you can move them into "cold storage" addresses and you can find tutorials on how to make those.

I think that method will be a short lived transitional stage. Why incur even a 1% fee when you don't have to? There's no reason for it.  I think once people get comfortable with bitcoin, and I reckon people in Africa and India will catch on a lot quicker than us westerners, they'll just stay in bitcoin. Volatility isn't a problem for them, their local currency is already more volatile than that.

Its the same thing. This basically amounts to rebranding. A blockchain is only secure if it is mined, it is only mined if its native token has monetary value.
Banks are wasting their time with blockchain tech. Its not for them. A blockchain is a decentralised p2p network. They want to know how they can take that, and centralise it with themselves at the top. We already have those its called "a database".
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:03:54
I think we're going to go below $200. If you think about it that would still technically be "up" since the January crash brought the price down to $170. I think what the market needs to see is a "double bottom". We hit $170 once, bounce off it and then come back around and again bounce off a point somewhere just above $170. So look for $170 to $200. I think this will instil some confidence in the market because seeing the price bounce off $170 would be a good sign that the price cannot go any lower than that. Maybe the market just has to do it twice to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke.
I know its depressing as hell but think of it as a purge. A purification. It clears out all the suckers and weak hands and just leaves those of us with a strong stomach. It could even be a good buying opportunity if you've been buying at $250 or $300. Bargain bitcoin.
I think we're going to have to wait another couple of years to really see the price go anywhere. Let the ecosystem around bitcoin develop and mature, and then when that's ready (in 2 or 3 years) it will pull the price up to meet it.
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:09:00
I don't think so. All of the US Marshall's auctions involved selling tens of thousand of BTC at once and the price didn't budge at all. I also don't know of any way of bulk buying a million bitcoins at once (unless I tracked down Satoshi himself and made him an offer) so I would likely have to do it piecemeal. So I would probably be able to accumulate a million bitcoins "under the radar" and not cause any major price moves.
@_date: 2015-11-08 22:18:03
At that price I would be just shy of being a millionaire. I think bitcoin can do better than that. HODL!
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:09:48
It will work with both regardless. Its looking less and less likely that an actual hard fork will result, but if it did, only bitcoins mined after the work would be incompatible with the counterpart blockchain. Bitcoins mined before the fork would be backwards compatible with either chain.
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:18:34
What do you plan on using them for? Its a trade off between security and convenience. If you want convenience try blockchain.info, or a smartphone app, or a desktop client.
If you want security take your bitcoins offline with a paper wallet with 2 factor authentication (my preferred method).

1. Use a computer that does not connect to the internet or book from a disc like Ubuntu live CD while your wifi is turned off. 
2. Do a few test runs with very small amounts. I recently moved $5,000 of bitcoin into cold storage on an encrypted paper wallet but I did about 5 practice ones using 20 cents a time.

I don't know exactly how individual companies will fare. My guess is Coca-Cold and McDonalds will still be around.
My guess is that the next crash will actually begin with a sovereign debt crisis. National governments are at the point now where they have so much debt they simply cannot pay it back its impossible it doesn't matter how high they make taxes. The US government takes in about 3.5 trillion and its debt is now over 18 trillion and growing. That's like earning $50,000 euros a year and having a credit card debt of $250,000 + interest.
So I think they're going to do QE. America did QE so I think they are going to be doing QE4 (or QE4ever as I like to call it) the Eurozone are starting their QE program as well. QE is just their fancy term for print a whole lot of money and use that to pay back your debt. For everyone else that's called "counterfeiting" and you go to jail for them that's "sound fiscal policy".
I don't know if you know what inflation actually is its when the government prints more money the money becomes worth less because its being diluted. 3000 euros might buy you a 2nd hand car then you find 2 years later 3000 euros buys you a rubbish TV. Its not that everything else got more expensive its that the money became worth less.
I've actually got a Zimbabwe dollar note its a 100 TRILLION dollar note. Its absolutely worthless. I bought it as a collectable for 3 pounds. That's what happened to Zimbabwe they're currency went into insane inflation so 1 Zimbabwe dollar would buy you a loaf of bread, and then a year later a billion Zimbabwe dollars would buy you 1 loaf of bread, then a year after that 100 trillion would not buy you a loaf of bread then they just gave up and scrapped the currency.
Now the European Central Bank is doing the same thing (on purpose!) with the Euro. I don't think it will hit crazy Zimbabwe money billion euros to buy a coffee style inflation, but they are deliberately trying to cause SOME inflation. So yeah gold or silver (honestly I'd go for silver) would be a good bet because when inflation hits that's when people run to safe havens which are assets that cannot be printed at will like gold and silver.

Yeah it's back up to about 318 so I reckon it's due one more drop. If it can stay above the $300 mark buyers will probably start pouring in and we'll see another rally. This is about the 4th time this year it's breached 300 if it can stay above it this time it could be a major turning point.

I don't think this has the impact on growth that you are suggesting it does I don't think most people are so petty and spiteful that they will not buy in to what may be the most lucrative investment opportunity of the century, just because people who bought in 3 years before they did will make an even bigger return. If they want to cut off their nose to spite their face let them.

"if they're inflating to pay the debt they're pretending to pay the debt"
Well, yeah that's exactly what they are doing. They don't have the money to pay off their debts, so they just print it and use that to pay of their debts, and you get screwed because the value of your savings is diluted.
The debt is government debt. Say you get a 10 year bond (the term "bond" comes from "bondage", as in "slavery") what that means is the government is saying loan me X amount of money now, and 10 years from now someone will pay the money back plus interest. (that "someone" is the tax payers, and you can now get 75 year bonds which means it will be paid back by tax payers who are not even born yet).
The people who buy the bonds (thus loaning the money) are other governments and banks. So all it is is give me money now and after I'm out of office someone will have to tax YOU to pay it back plus interest.

With bitcoin you don't actually hold the bitcoins, the bitcoins are held in the blockchain. What you actually hold are the private keys. I know the "wallet" holds "keys"....anyway so you hold the keys that's how you authorise transactions.
"Cold storage" is where you generate a private key on a computer that does not connect to the internet. There's no possible chance for a "leak"; for the key to end up on the internet. The key is totally offline so there's no way for a hacker to get a copy of it.
That's what I did I dug out an old laptop (so old it doesn't have wi fi) and using an old usb stick transferred a paper wallet generator to the laptop and used that (this computer was not and will never connect to the internet again) to print out a paper wallet. You print out a private key on a piece of paper, along with a corresponding public address. A low tech solution to a hi tech problem.
That way you can send all the bitcoins you want to the public address (which is a copy of an address on the blockchain) but the corresponding private key only exists on that bit of paper. Public addresses only allow coins in, only the private key authorises transactions out.
That's how cold storage works you're sending bitcoins to an address, the private key for which is completely offline. Its not convenient for day to day use (you need to make a new one if you ever spend from that address because its no longer cold after that, although you can send TO it as much as you want) but its a great solution for long term secure holding of larger amounts.

"If tx rates grow faster than non-commercial bandwidth or affordable hardware then we'll have a problem."
But it will not grow faster forever. What would likely happen is more of an arms race. The tendency towards centralisation would ebb and flow, never reaching either extreme. 
Tx volume might outstrip the growth in home bandwidth/mass storage, but within a few years home bandwidth and mass storage has caught up.
Moore's law states that computer performance doubles every two years but transaction volume cannot double every 2 years consistently. There just aren't enough people on the planet.

There are currently about 15.5 million bitcoins in circulation. It is currently counting up to its final total of 21 million, which will be reached around the year 2140 (because the minting rate halves every 4 years it asymptotes).
I personally have a not insignificant number of bitcoins (more than 10, less than 100) "on ice" and I am holding them for the next 10-12 years as a speculative investment.
Is it worth it? I think so, I have a significant amount of my own money in it. With all the caveats of "don't invest what you cannot afford to lose", why not? Take a chance. Invest $20 a week. In 10 years who knows it might be worth a few bucks.

I always just think the market is smarter than you or I. Sure, neither you or me or the author can think how miners will be able to operate profitably after the next block halving, but I'm not a miner and I'm pretty sure the author isn't either. It's called "innovation" someone somewhere will find a way because there's money to be made. The mistake is thinking if you can't see a solution, then there is no solution. My prediction is the halving will come and go with no significant impact on hash rate. We know years in advance its coming so the miners will be prepared

I think the long term price decline ended in January. The price peaked at $1100 due to MtGox screwing with the price. It took more than a year for the market to recover. But I think it has recovered and the long term price trend is now "up". We're due a brief correction and we'll see the price hit $260 before it hits $300 but I think the price will reach and stay above the $300 mark within the next 2-3 weeks.
If you're willing to just ride it out and hold on to your bitcoin for 3-5 years I think the potential gains are staggering.

A Ponzi scheme by definition requires 2 basic things. 1. absolute centralisation. A Ponzi scheme is usually run by one person. A small group is possible, but the larger the group the greater the risk of defection, therefore 1 perpetrator is the usual form, and 2. complete lack of transparency.
How is bitcoin anything like that? Bitcoin is 100% decentralised and 100% transparent. In other words, the exact opposite of a Ponzi scheme.

I don't think its anything to do with the auction I think this correction is entirely to be expected and will be brief few days maybe a week then the advance will resume. The last 2 auctions had almost no effect on price, and the price has increased from 220 to almost 290 in a very short space of time a correction down to say 260 is healthy. A non-stop bull run is another term for "bubble". It'll probably bump around in the 260's before resuming advance up to 300 then we'll see what the view is from there.

That will *always* be a possibility. Until those coins creep back into general circulation we'll just have to live with the fact that someone out there is sitting on a million+ coins and they could dump them on the exchange at any moment.
Although that doesn't really make much sense because 1. Satoshi could have cashed out at any time in the last 3 years and been very nearly a billionaire and he hasn't 2. why would the original creator sabotage his own creation? 3. Why do it now at this critical time? Assuming Satoshi is not a monk or a masochist, he's probably looking forward to the halvening as much as we are because his coins are going to increase in value too 4. Why would knowing who Satoshi is make him less likely to liquidate his holdings? If anything it would seem to do the opposite, because having 1 million bitcoins, and having people *know who you are in real life*, to me seems like a liability not a plus. If I was Satoshi and I was outed, I would be selling my coins as a public gesture to distance myself from the project. I wouldn't want to be the next Snowden.

I'll go in reverse order
1. Bitcoin fails. That to me is the most unlikely scenario. Bitcoin has been through its baptism by fire, many times. Check out "bitcoin obituaries" its failed like 35 times now, and its still here. Bitcoin is the world's most resilient currency.
If you want an analogy I think of the banks as the dinosaurs. Massive beasts, you think nothing could ever bring them down. Bitcoin is the tiny rat-like sabre-toothed mammal that's scurrying about under their feet. Its the the little mammal that is the future, because the dinosaurs are too big to adapt.
2. The cap is increased. Again this is tantamount to impossible. Yes the core code could be changed to allow for more than 21 million coins, but bitcoin is a consensus network so we would all have to AGREE to increase the cap, and deliberately DEVALUE the coins we already hold. Good luck with that.
3. Bitcoin price goes through the roof. I actually think this is the most likely scenario. Lets say the market cap is a trillion dollars. Its still a trillion dollars whether we have 21 million bitcoins or 210 million bitcoins. It doesn't make any difference how many bitcoins there are the total value is the same. 
So if the market cap was a trillion that makes 1 bitcoin about $50,000. So what? Why is an increase of $300 to $50,000 any more difficult to believe than an increase from a few cents to $300? The unit value of a bitcoin in no way impacts its use or how it works. Even if a bitcoin was worth a million dollars you could still use bitcoin to buy a coffee. Its digital so its completely fungible.
My guess is the more people have bitcoin, the more people will want it. People value that which is rare, and the  more users bitcoin has, the rarer it gets, and that bids up the price. I think $10,000 per coin is just the beginning.
Take Facebook. Facebook is not the internet it is just one company that runs on the internet. Its worth about $150 billion dollars. What if I had said to you in 1995 that there will be single companies running on the internet that are worth over 100 billion? You would have laughed at me.
10 years from now, I think there will be single companies running on the bitcoin network that can rival Facebook in size, which would put the total network market cap in the trillions.
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:36:51
Again. Overkill. Are you sure YOU will be able to recover your bitcoins? That's what I'm saying; keep it simple because it happens all the time where people go insane on bitcoin security and they make it so secure they lock themselves out and the coins are lost forever.
Its Murphy's law; what can go wrong will go wrong. The more complicated your security process is the more possibility there is for something to go wrong with it. That's why I kept mine simple. 5 copies of an offline generated private key, protected with a password, spread out a bit so they aren't all in the same building. Good luck breaking through that that is super secure I would sleep quite soundly with a few million dollars worth of bitcoin held in that address.
In fact, I do plan on having a few million dollars in that address, hence the security.

With all the caveats that I don't have a crystal ball and I cannot predict the future with certainty I'd say yes I would divest from stocks and put it all on bitcoin (or gold and silver). The stock market is in a massive bubble right now its riding a wave to Fed funny money but that ended about 5 months ago and what are we seeing? The stock market is slowing down. Its like a ball thrown in the air it goes up, slows down, then starts falling. If you bought stocks recently you're probably buying at the top of the cliff. 
I do plan on buying a lot of stocks in the nearish future but I'm waiting until its crashed. I'm going to wait until there is massive capitulation in the stock market and there's blood in the streets as traders try to get out of their stocks at any price. That's when I'll dive in and buy up a crap load of stock on the cheap and hold on to it until the next stock market bubble. Had I bought stocks during the bottom of the 2008 crash I would be selling them right now.

Yeah why not. I mean lets look at your options.
1. The most obvious; keep it in Euros. Put your 1000 euros in a savings account and sit on it. This is the worst choice because its going to lose money. Euro inflation against the US dollar over the past 12 months is something like 40% its insane. The Euro is teetering on the brink of being worthless. So keeping it as Euros is the worst idea.
2. The stock market. This is not going to be an option for you because you usually need a brokerage firm which puts up all sorts of hurdles first of all you would have to be over 18 and you'd need a lot more than a thousand. They would have a minimum portfolio and it would be a LOT more than that.
3. Index funds. Track the economy, however I think the economy is about to go down the toilet. You would be investing at the worst possible time in my opinion.
4. Invest in gold. OK that's a possibility you can actually buy 99.99% pure gold bullion coins from reputable online dealers and have it sent straight to your house. Unfortunately 1 gold coin is more than 1000 euros, so you cannot afford one.
5. Silver. A decent investment if you ask me. You could buy 50 silver coins for 1000 euros (buy actual coins not ETF's or other "paper") and I expect silver to do well over the next 5 years.
6. Bitcoin. To be honest, this is where I would put my money. Bitcoin's value is down just not but I consider that growing pains, and the potential upsides are enormous. At the end of the day, its a thousand euros. Its not pocket change, but its not going to change your life either, so if bitcoin went to zero its not like you'd be homeless. If bitcoin works, then you'll have a lot more than a thousand euros worth. But please look into properly securing your bitcoins for long term holding before you charge in and buy them and then lose them because you don't know what you're doing.

Deflation is only bad if you're a Keynesian, which is a discredited economic theory. It just hangs on because it suits governments. GDP is not a good measure of how well the economy is doing because all that does is tell you how much money you spent. If the government took out a trillion dollar loan and used it to build a giant statue of Barack Obama out of solid gold, that would show up as "economic growth". That's obviously nonsense.
Keynesian economics is based on the idea that consumption, not savings and investments, is what grows the economy. Buy stuff, by stuff as fast as you can. Buy 10 of them. That's not growth that's just waste.

Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places, not to infinity. The block size debate is basically about how to handle transaction volume. A block is found about once every 10 minutes, a block has a maximum capacity (imposed, not organic to the code) of 1 megabyte, which puts an upper limit on how many transactions you can have in 10 minutes. Works out about 7 per second.
Compare that to VISA or Mastercard, which process more like 50,000 transactions per second.
The debate is about how do we, from a technical standpoint, scale bitcoin to handle larger transaction volume.

You do not want to go too overboard on security. What if you secure your bitcoins so well, that you cannot unlock them? It has happened.
I'll tell you what I did. Super simple but super secure.
1. Get an old laptop (I had one lying around, perhaps you do too).
2. Load up bitaddress.org downloaded from GitHub to run offline.
3. Disconnect from internet. This computer can never connect to the internet again.
4. Generate a paper wallet and BIP38 encrypt its private key.
5. Printed 5 copies of the SAME wallet.
6. Kept 2 at home (I've taken great care to make sure the paper will last 20 years, put them in plastic wallets and what not) and distributed the other 3 to trusted friends and family who do not know the BIP38 encryption pass 
So simple. I only have one wallet address, but 5 redundant copies of my private key. 100% guaranteed deep cold storage with 2 factor authentication. Doesn't get more secure than that.

The network at this rate is essentially impenetrable. The total hashrate is something like 400 petahashes I can't remember exactly what that works out at but its something like 1000 times the top 500 supercomputers in the world. Combined.
In order to hijack the network you would have to amass that much processing power, actually slightly more because you need at least 51%, and then somehow sustain that. The electricity that would consume would power a mid sized American city. So you spend several billion dollars, burn through hundreds of thousands of dollars an hour of electricity (where would you even keep this?) and you get control of the bitcoin network for a grand total of 10 minutes, at which point everyone on the network can see it is being 51% attacked and then an army of pissed off nerds come after you with every computer virus and denial of service attack they can dream of.
Or you could just use your hardware to mine bitcoin. A 51% attack makes no sense. Even if you could somehow pull it off its more profitable to use it to mine than it is to try to sabotage mining.

If you want to hodl a larger amount for the long term do not use an online wallet. Whether blockchain.info or an exchange.
I'll tell you what I did I made paper wallets from an offline OS. BIP38 encrypted them so they have 2 factor authentication. Made 5 copies of the same wallet kept 2 in my house and hid the other 3 in other locations.
A low tech solution to a high tech problem.
Since these things are paper and need to last 20 years I just used Schwartz jars (these things

No one. Bitcoin is a decentralised network. What Bitcoin (capital "B") is, is a *protocol*. Its a rulebook. Its a set of instructions for a computer on how to maintain consensus with n number of other computers. There is no one in charge, just a bunch of computers that, by running the bitcoin protocol, all agree to be bound by the same rules.
Bitcoins are minted by a process called "mining". Which is solving a mathematical puzzle that takes about 10 minutes to solve. The miner that solves the puzzle wins the next batch of bitcoins (currently 25 a pop).
No one actually issues these bitcoins its just an agreed upon rule that the winning miner gets that reward. Its also a preprogrammed rule that at block 440,000, that reward drops to 12.5 coins.
That's why miners mine but the side effect of that is network security. The only way to "hijack" the network, is to out-mine all of the other miners...combined. That would be difficult to say the least.
There's about 15.5 million coins in circulation just now, and its counting up to 21 million, but the count halves every 4 years so its actually going to take about another 125 years to hit the final 21 million mark.
So rather than command/control, it is *consensus*. Everyone participating in the network agrees these are the rules, and if you try to change the rules all that happens is your bitcoin node is not recognised by the rest of the network.

Simple; fungibility. If I loan you $100 I don't care if you give me back a different $100 bill, or 2 $50's, one's as good as another. That's a critical feature of money one unit is as good as another they are completely interchangeable. My car is not fungible. If I loan you my car, and you give me back a different car, we've got a problem.
If bitcoins had unique identifiers then bitcoins would not be fungible. Some bitcoins would be worth more than others. It would no longer work as a currency. It is essential to bitcoin's function that a bitcoin is a bitcoin is a bitcoin.

The block reward is a subsidy. Bitcoin mining maintains the integrity of the network and validates transactions. If there is no incentive, there is no point mining.
The end goal is that bitcoin miners will be paid 100% purely from transaction fees. 1 cent a transaction, 1 billion transactions per day, that's a lot of money to be claimed.
Right now there aren't a billion transactions today so the block reward is a subsidy. 50 bitcoins per block, then 25, and next year 12.5. The idea is that as bitcoin matures and transaction volumes increase, the block reward falls away and they make their money just from fees.

The simplest way is to just flat out buy some. Doesn't have to be megabucks you can buy $5 worth if you want. Find an exchange that suits you (Coinbase, Kraken, Bitbargain, it varies from country to country) and use that. You can even use localbitcoins where you can arrange to meet a seller in person at a Starbucks and pay cash and transfer bitcoins on your smartphones.

Yes the algorithm is quite smart that way. If for example block generation drops to about 8 minutes, the puzzle gets harder. If it goes up to say 12 minutes, it gets a bit easier. It does this fairly often I think its about once every 10 days or so the difficultly level will self adjust so that the average is always about 10 minutes.

No of course not. Fundamentally, at the end of the day, it is *production* that drives the economy. Production produces wealth, thus raising our standard of living. The entire point of an economy.
The Fed is essentially creating fake wealth. It skips production and goes straight to money, so its like shot in the arm. Or more appropriately a morphine drip. But sooner or later the market has to balance the scales because all of the money in the system, has to balance against all of the stuff in the system. The Fed has jumped over production and just produced a whole lot of money.
Sooner or later the market has to correct that, and its going to hurt.

A greater number of users automatically means it's more diffuse but if you are talking about "income inequality" or "holdings inequality" more accurately then I think overtime this will spread out.
Sure those early adopters might be sitting on thousands of coins but eventually what are they going to do? Spend them. Eventually those coins will be released back into general circulation.
I'm the most dedicated hodler you'll ever meet I'm holding on to my bitcoins like they have the air supply but one day I will spend them back into circulation and I'll never have this many coins again.
Growing inequality and a hollowing out of the middle is a symptom of a statist fiat system. A free market system of limited currency will tend to be more balanced most wealth in the middle with the extremes on both ends being outliers.

Does it? Miners might not have upgraded their hardware but who knows what other efficiencies they have made? Its probably impossible to calculate really because there will be too many variables, and of course each mining operation is different.
If anything you could argue that today bitcoin is more vulnerable, because miners have even less margin to play with. Less able to sustain mining below production cost. No miners = no bitcoin.
I don't think that's going to happen. I don't think a total collapse of hashrate is even at all likely. The halvening is going to put a few miners out of business but I actually expect total hashrate to increase. I'm just playing devil's advocate the reality is we don't know what's going to happen. Whatever happens though it will be interesting.

I think $10,000 per coin is too conservative since its only about 30 times bitcoin's current price. Considering how small bitcoin is in terms of users and the median amount of money per user that they have in bitcoin its still really early days.

Yes this probably will happen eventually. Most nodes would only have say the last 1 million blocks (about 15 years of data) which would be 100's of gigabytes but that won't be a problem. My smartphone has 60GB of memory today in 2015.

Hmm I'm not sure. I'm not a fan of democracy I'm an anarcho-capitalist (think Murray Rothbard or Stefan Molyneux) because democracies not only give rise to the tyranny of the majority but it prioritises short term over the long term. For example a politician says "vote for me and I will increase your pension". That's a bribe. In the private sector that's illegal. That's a conflict of interest in any other area of your life (whether you are a courtroom judge, or a board member of a corporation) you would have to recuse yourself, except when it comes to the core function of government apparently.
As for capitalism I'd need to hear the exact arguments. No one understands what the hell capitalism actually is. Marxists object to capitalism obviously and their arguments don't make any sense. A lot of people today object to what they think is capitalism but really its cronyism and corruption its nothing to do with capitalism.

It went from 220 to 295 in a very short space of time. It corrected back to 260. That's totally normal and should be expected by anyone who follows bitcoin at all.
Personally I'd be OK with no real developments in bitcoin for the whole of 2015. 2014 was a year of recovery after the MtGox/Willy Bot scandal. The dust has settled now but I think it could take another year for the market to get its confidence back. MtGox did a lot of damage lets not forget that.

OK I see the predicament you are in but then its not a question of security exactly. The concern here isn't a cyber attack or a thief breaking into your house the problem is that you may be ordered by a court to hand them over.
In that case; brain wallet. No physical trace whatsoever. Here's what you do
1. Think of a passphrase. It should be long and unusual but easy to remember. Something like "My favourite pizza is Superman II from Mars".
That makes no sense grammatically but its weird and easy to remember. You then run that through a wallet generator and it generates a key pair. Send the bitcoins to the address given, and wipe the computer. Reformat the hard drive.
Your bitcoins are now stored in your head. There's nothing a court can use to prove ownership there are no encrypted drives there's no paper wallets there is no physical trace anywhere. Nothing a court can use as evidence.
After you move to Mexico, load up a wallet generator and hash "My favourite pizza is Superman II from Mars" and it will reconstruct the private key for you, and you can then move your bitcoins elsewhere.
I wouldn't exactly recommend a brain wallet for general long term storage but in extremis it is a handy way of getting rid of evidence.

I'm speaking hypothetically (20-30 years in the future) where the block reward is only a fraction of what it is now and miners are dependent on fees rather than the block reward itself.
I actually don't worry about scaling that much. There will come a day when the bitcoin network handles 10 million transaction blocks its going to have to have that capacity if its going to function as a global payment network, but we'll get there.

Deflation is bad in a debt based paradigm. Of course, both inflation and deflation are bad in a debt based system the whole problem with a debt based system is that whether you take on more debt or pay it back, the ratio of debt to money always increases. A debt based system is doomed for the get go its a Ponzi scheme.
Deflation in an asset based system like bitcoin, or gold or silver, is a very different situation. Sure a sudden deflation may have short term negative effects, but in an asset based system the deflationary shock is self limiting. If you have a sudden deflation which businesses were not expecting and cannot adapt to, they go out of business. This means capital goods are falling in price. But things like food they do not because demand for them is inelastic for obvious reasons. So what happens is that creates profit opportunities you can buy capital goods on the cheap and use them to provide necessities that tend to have a reasonably constant price and demand, thus slowing down the deflation.
Its the policy of constant inflation that is what causes this cycle of increasingly spectacular booms and busts.

The block reward is a subsidy for the miners while the blockchain bootstraps. The idea is that as the block reward diminishes the number of transactions increases with the user base.

Its more than that. 2014 was a baptism by fire. The price bombed from $1,200 to $170 over the course of 14 months. Such a drop was not the biggest ever in bitcoin terms (when it went from $35 to $2 holds that record) but this decline was 1. the most enduring and 2. the first one anyone noticed. No one was paying attention to bitcoin in 2011. They were paying attention in 2014.
So we had a year of relentless, and high profile, price decline and a tonne of bad news to really rub salt on the wounds...and bitcoin is still here. This is a new era because if bitcoin survived THAT, bitcoin can survive anything. I think this is the point where people start to catch on that this bitcoin thing they think is a load of nonsense is not going away.
@_date: 2015-02-28 15:17:06
You can send TO a cold storage wallet as many times as you like. But only send FROM it once. Once you use it you consider that compromised because it is strictly speaking no longer cold storage once its private key has signed a transaction. So if you have to spend it, import 100% of the funds and throw it away. Think of it as a piggy bank you have to break open to get the money out.
If physical risks such as fire/theft are a concern then you can do what I did. I created a paper wallet from an offline laptop (never to connect to the internet again) and BIP38 encrypted it. I printed 5 copies and kept 2 for myself, and entrusted the other 3 to family members and a very close friend.
So if my house burned down, I have 3 redundant back up copies. If a copy was stolen, its not use to the thief because its encrypted they still need the BIP38 passphrase. If one of my family members I had trusted with the wallet tried to rob me, its no use because I never told them the passphrase either.
So my bitcoins are essentially un-stealable and I don't have to worry about acts of nature like a flood or a fire because I have copies of the wallet all over the country.

OK lets say the miners rebelled, and withheld their hashing power from the network. Difficulty goes down and it becomes more profitable for the miners who stay.

No its not a joke and its also not necessary. I just happened to have a 12 year old laptop lying around and I didn't care what happened to it. You can achieve the same effect by creating a bootable cd like Ubuntu and running that on your laptop with your wifi turned off.
5000 is different than 5 x 20 cents? No not really. Not to bitcoin. Bitcoin itself does not care if its 20 cents or 20 million dollars the transaction works the same way. I use encrypted paper wallets I made a few test ones to make sure I can send money to them and get it out again so I'm absolutely sure I'll be able to get my 21 BTC out of the real thing.
Sending coins to offline storage is really easy remember you do not hold bitcoins strictly speaking. What you hold are the private keys. So when you create a wallet offline, say a paper wallet like I do you print the private keys out on paper, you then send the bitcoins to that public address. The public address is in the blockchain, but the associated key that unlocks it is printed out on a bit of paper. The bitcoins themselves don't go offline, but the key code is.

I find the best way to track the state of the economy is to keep up with the news. Keep up with the podcasts from the pundits like Mike Maloney and Peter Schiff these are the guys who predicted the 2008 crash and they're saying right now we are in another bubble about to head into the next crash.
That's kind of my strategy I'm betting against national currencies. The stock market, the S&amp;P 500, index funds blah blah blah all of this stuff is tied to the health of the currency itself. If the dollar goes, bye bye stock market. Same with the euro and the UK pound and the Chinese Yuan. I'm betting against them by putting my money into....anything else. 
For me that's gold (I don't own much at all), silver (I own some) and bitcoins where I have most of my investments. That's it that's my 3 investments because I think there is going to be a massive crash and soon (wouldn't surprise me if happens this year, and I'd be very surprised if it doesn't happen within 2 years) and the entire economy is going to implode. At that point dislocated money is going to be looking for a safe haven which is traditionally gold, silver and my hope is bitcoin will be a new option.
When government issued money goes down the toilet, people are going to look for alternatives which is gold, silver and bitcoin. So you want to get into these now so you are in position when everyone else starts panic buying.

Well lets chart it exponentially. Lets keep it simple we need to get to 1 million, so how many times does the bitcoin price have to double to equal that? We'll just work backwards 1 mil / 2 = $500,000 and so on. 12 halvings takes us to $244, so on the same order of magnitude as it is right now. That means, in order to reach $1 million by Christmas 2017 the bitcoin price must *double* on average once every 2 months consistently for 2 years straight.

I think its particularly important since it seems that the price decline of the last year has reversed, and once the price goes above 300 that's when people will catch on that the price is going north.

Its pretty straight forward really. Price was increasing at a nice, steady pace for a couple of years, then in November 2013 MtGox screwed that all to hell. It wasn't just incompetence it was fraud. By rights Karpeles should be in jail. Through MtGox manipulating the price with buying bots etc they price shot up from about $100 and change, to well over $1000.
The past 15 months has been the price finding its feet again after that massive manipulated price spike. Its just now finally getting back to some kind of normality.

Bitcoin might actually be one of the rarest assets in the world. If you took all above ground gold (so not counting gold still underground and things like asteroids) and split it into 21 million equally sized bricks, each brick would be about 700 ounces. So a bitcoin is ~700 times rarer than a gold coin.
There are almost no natural resources (other than say weapons grade uranium) that come close to being that rare on Earth. Out of 92 naturally occurring elements, I could find data on the relative abundance of 86 of them. Gold ranked 79th rarest on Earth, and no one is going to find an asteroid made of bitcoin.
If you hold a bitcoin, you hold something truly rare. The fact that it is digital should not be a hurdle. Scarce is scarce whether its metal you can hold in your hand or digital data in the blockchain.

I think we're in an awkward market. The bear is dead and no one realises it yet. I think maybe people are starting to catch on that we're now in a bull market, but are still afraid of a zombie bear attack. I reckon once we get above $300 and stay there that's when people will catch on that the long term trend is going to be "up" for some time now.

As with anything the weak point here is the human brain itself. You might forget your seed, even one character out and you're screwed, or have an accident or something. Or you don't create enough randomness. You will tend to create patterns i.e rhyming words, or grammatically correct sentences. This greatly reduces entropy because it gives clues to what the next word is.
In my opinion brainwallets are fantastic as an emergency measure only. Say you need to hop the border to escape a military coup of your country. You could put your coins in a brainwallet so you can take your wealth with you while physically having nothing on your person. Nothing for border cops to confiscate.
But as a long term secure storage there are much better opinions.

I think that Apple and Google will survive such an upheaval but I don't think they are going to be making money or seeing their stock rise. These are tech companies they make lifestyle goods (smart phones etc) there are the kinds of companies they DON'T do well in a crash because they sell luxuries not necessities. If people are tightening their belts its the luxuries that get cut out.
Do I think that bitcoin will become the global reserve standard? Hmm hard to tell. Probably not. Yes China and Russia are moving off the SWIFT system and lots of countries are engaged in bilateral trade agreements to undermine the petrodollar but the problem is no country wants to see the system replaced. What they want is to be in charge of it. 
Right now the world reserve currency is the US dollar and China does not want to end that system, they just want to replaced the dollar with the RMB. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. That's my fear is that history is going to repeat itself and we're going to make the same mistake all over again and give one country absolute power over the global financial system, and we'll be right back here in 20-30 years.
Bitcoin is the natural choice for a global reserve currency because it does not confer great advantage on any one player. My hope (and fervent prayer!) is that if China tries to replace the dollar with the RMB as the global reserve country everyone else has enough sense to see we've been down this road before. Bitcoin really leaps off the page as the obvious alternative.

What went wrong for bearwhale there though was timing. They put in a load of sell orders at 300 when the price was what? 380? It backfired because the market was not prepared to go that low yet. I'm not sure how to explain it is like we as the market, collectively, have to discover the price together and that turned out to be $170 but the market had to get there at its own pace. Bearwhale jumped the gun and deviated too far from the market's chosen path, and probably ended up losing a lot of money in the process unless they were patient and waited before buying back the coins they lost.

If they were to issue "IOU $1M USD from Bank." on the basis of 1 Satoshi, that's fractional reserve banking. Since when has that ever ended well? When it all goes wrong, that 1 satoshi is now collateral against a million USD, which means the value of 1 satoshi has to get bid up to cover the debt. So one bitcoin would be worth 100 million USD :D

Big price spikes always give up some of their gains. Look at the big one of October last year. Went from 200 and something to almost 500, then all the way back down to just a bit over 300.
Calling a top and bottom ahead of time is impossible but when you see the price chart go parabolic you can be sure that's a spike and it's going to retrace a good chunk of that. That's just basic common sense the price never skyrockets and then levels off. It skyrockets then crashes before finding it's new equilibrium.
@_date: 2016-05-29 20:55:16
No because the idea is that the spill over into ethereum as bitcoin is on the way back down post halving rally, this pushes up the price of ether relative to BTC, so then sell ether for bitcoin and you end up with more bitcoin.
Sure I suppose you could cash out to fiat at the peak of the rally and buy bitcoin back on the way down and the end result would be the same (you've increased your position in bitcoin), but going from crypto to crypto is just easier than going crypto to fiat and back again.

The supply of bitcoins is designed to mimic precious metals. There's a certain amount of gold in the world and every year we dig up a bit more but eventually there will be none left to mine. So supply tapers off with time.
Rather than government issued fiat money which can be inflated to infinity (hyper inflation is where the government prints so much money it becomes worthless. For example I have a $100 TRILLION Zimbabwe dollar bill. Its absolutely worthless except as a collectable), so rather than allow bitcoin to do the same there was a hard cap programmed into it at the very start.
Its a deflationary currency. The supply is limited to an ultimate cap of 21 million possible coins which makes bitcoins a rare asset. As bitcoin grows they increase in value. Everyone thinks "deflation" is a bad thing but its not. Inflation is really just a regressive tax it makes everything go up in price.
For example people complain gas prices are too high. Gas has never been cheaper. 10 years ago an ounce of silver would have bought you 3 gallons of gas, now it will buy you 7. Gas prices have gone up in dollars not because gas is more expensive but because the dollars are broken.
The government believes inflation is a good thing. It seems Satoshi disagreed. Bitcoin is an experiment in a limited supply currency. Let bitcoin run alongside government money, and may the best man win (my money is on bitcoin).

Go low tech. Go on to bitaddress.org and download the generator from GitHub. Run the generator offline just unplugged your wifi. Print out a paper wallet. A low tech solution you just print out an address on paper that way it cannot be hacked. Just don't lose that bit of paper. Clear your browser history and restart your computer just to clear its memory. It's pretty secure you can be reasonably sure there are no copies of your private key on your computer and you use the paper wallet address as a vault.

The idea is that as block rewards drop bitcoin becomes so ubiquitous that's transaction fees, although only a few cents, total millions of dollars per day.
@_date: 2016-05-22 21:04:50
I'm not worried for 2 reasons. First of all at 10 minutes a block 2000 blocks is about 2 weeks' worth. Even if hashing power dropped by 50%, and its taking 20-30 minutes to find a block on average, all the network has to do is make it through 2000 of them. So we have to put up with a slow network for 4-6 weeks and then difficulty re-targets.
Second, everyone, especially the miners, have known the block reward would half in mid-2016. We've always known. No one is getting taken by surprise here.

Sounds like you could be a bit TOO diversified. I always think a portfolio should never consist of more than about 10 individual investments.
For example I hold gold, silver and bitcoin as alternatives to fiat currency and although they sort of all into the same category I count them as 3 separate things, because they are.
I own stock in 4 companies and like you I tried to avoid dotcom stuff but only one of those is in technology the other 3 are "human need" which is stocks in suppliers of basic essentials. Regardless of what happens the economy, people need to eat. Its not glamorous, but I consider these my "slow and steady wins the day" options. I avoid things like derivatives and ETF's those are really just I.O.U's.
And that's it. So at any one time I'm only having to keep an eye on a total of 7 different assets. You have 7 different CATEGORIES that's maybe starting to get a bit too diverse because its a lot to keep track of.

I think now is about as good as it gets. Nothing is ever guaranteed but it really does look as though the decline of the past 14 months has finally hit bedrock. Look at it this way $5,000 euros is nothing to sneeze at, but its hardly a life changing amount of money, but 25 BTC might be, one day.
Besides the Eurotwats are planning their own massive QE program which means your 5,000 euros is about to be worth a lot less and there's nothing you can do about it. All you can do is either spend it now or invest it into another asset. I say go for it, no one ever got rich playing it safe.

There's no reason the price per coin could not go below the mining cost per coin for quite a while. This actually happened in 2015 for a few months. Since miners are so heavily invested they are committed all they can do is keep mining, and hope the price goes back up before they go bankrupt.
Personally I don't think this will happen there has been too much positive sentiment and even outside the community the news stories have been kinder to bitcoin's good name. 3600 coins are mined every day and the price has stayed fairly steady for a couple of months that means there is enough demand to absorb 3600 coins per day. That's about to drop to 1800 that's a lot of unsatisfied demand, so price gets bid up.
It'll probably way overshoot I won't be surprised if the price passes $2,000, and then crashes back to $700 or something. Still twice what it is now and I've already got my position so I'm just going to enjoy the show. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:03:07
I've been cost averaging my way in to the market over the past 13 months; the lower the price went the more money I put in to it. I've actually bought about half of those in the last 2 months when the price was under $350.
I'm quite fortunate really that I can afford to do this. I'm not married I don't have kids I don't have debts to pay and I've got a pretty good job. $5,000 spread over the course of a year is a loss I could take on the chin if bitcoin went to zero.
I wouldn't put any more into it though, 21 BTC is plenty. If bitcoin went to $100,000 per coin that comes to a bit over $2 million that's more than enough to retire on as long as you don't go too crazy.
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:00:53

The value of bitcoin is in no way tied to the value of the dollar. The value of bitcoin rendered in dollars is a convenience borne of familiarity. If the dollar went the way of the dinosaur (and lets hope it does then maybe we can finally get our planet back) then we'll simply measure the value of bitcoin against something else.
I'm actually waiting for the day where I can look at real estate prices, and see the price rendered in both fiat terms and bitcoin. Or maybe just bitcoin since fiat imploded several years earlier.
The hyperinflation of fiat currencies would be a disaster for the world economy but a boom for bitcoin holders because displaced funds would be looking for a place to land. If you have $500,000 USD saved and the value of that is dropping like a rock with rockets attached you get your money out of that and into something else.
So I think we will see a skyrocketing demand for bitcoin as a financial safe haven as every fiat currency in the world goes to shit.

Offer a discount. Its Gresham's law; bad money drives out good. If I have bitcoin and fiat, I'm going to pay with the fiat and hoard the bitcoin. So the way to get me to pay you in bitcoin is offer a bitcoin exclusive discount. You bid down until you get that sweet spot where the discount I'm being offered is more attractive than my instinct to hoard the bitcoin.
And it makes sense for you because you're getting paid in an appreciating currency so even if you offer a 25% discount, well hopefully soon bitcoin will be worth 25% more.

The code "lives" on GitHub you can propose changes to it from there. As for the 21 million cap yes that code be changed. Lets say I, for whatever reason, decide there should be 21 billion bitcoins rather than 21 million. What I would have to do is fork the blockchain and create an alternative blockchain that runs parallel to the original (this in no way affects the original).
I can now make whatever changes I like to this alternative bitcoin blockchain.....and then nothing happens. At least slightly more than half of the miners must agree that my new blockchain should be considered the main or "authentic" blockchain and mine that one, so that my alternative chain becomes longer than the one it was forked from.
Of course the miners aren't going to do that. All I've done is forked the blockchain and no one will care they'll carry on mining the old blockchain. I must convince the miners (at least 51% of them) to voluntarily switch to my blockchain and mine that instead and they just aren't going to do that.

Safest place to keep gold is under your mattress. Usually the most common scam with gold is bars that have been drilled and refilled with tungsten. They still weigh about the same as a legitimate bar, so they can be hard to spot.
Probably the biggest gold scam, in history (if true) is the gold in Fort Knox and the New York Fed. No one has audited Fort Knox in about 50 years, and the New York Fed holds the gold of other nations and those nations have asked for it back, and the Fed for all practical purposes said "no".
At this point its looking pretty likely that there is no gold in Fort Knox or the New York Fed. Its probably ended up on black markets somewhere.

Do you know what the best way to make a million dollars day trading bitcoin is? Start with 2 million. Buying at 240 and selling at 250 sounds good in theory, but what if you buy at 250 and it goes down to 240? You need to wait for it to hit minimum 260 now. Hell there are folks here who bought in early 2014 when it was 850. Could be a while before we see 850 again.
I have a stash of bitcoins I am a HODL'er as we joke here so I do plan on selling my bitcoins for more than I paid for them...in 10 years time. Long term hold is probably the best strategy because if you are trying to game the system and skim $10 profit per coin off of price fluctuations, I can practically guarantee you are just going to lose money not make it.

OK lets say you and I are competing service providers that use bitcoin. Bitcoin itself has fees that are 0 or pennies, so we'll just ignore those we're talking strictly about our own fees.
I charge a 5% fee. What's the first thing you do? Charge a 4% fee. You don't raise it, you lower it, you try to beat me to get more customers. So of course I hear about you and your 4% fees, so I immediately drop it to 3%, then you go to 2%, and then I decide I make most of my profits from other areas of my business and offer 0% transaction fees as a perk.

I like bitaddress.org. Here's one of their designs:
Its pretty easy to use and you can BIP38 encrypt your wallet which gives it 2-factor authentication. Basically when you try to sweep the paper wallet it will ask you for the password, so even if a thief got their hands on your wallet, its password protected. I made 5 copies of the same password protected wallet and gave 3 away to trusted family and friends, but didn't give them the password. Even if my house burns to the ground, my coins are safe.
Best thing to do is to download the website from github so you can run it locally (offline). Even better is to boot up Ubuntu and disconnect your harddrive, so you are running your OS from a read-only disc (and disconnected from the internet) and then load bitaddress from a usb flash drive or something like that.

That would be true if bitcoin was infinitely divisible but it's not. It is divisible to 8 decimal places so 0.00000001 is the smallest possible unit of bitcoin, commonly called "a satoshi". Round about the year 2135 the block reward will halve to 1 satoshi (miners will be paid via transaction fees alone) then 4 years after that it just goes to 0 since you can't have half a satoshi.
It's a subsidy. Mining makes the network secure but miners need a reason to mine and right now fees are not enough to be economical.  The idea is as the network grows fees become worth more  (1 penny per transaction really adds up if 1 block contains 10 million transactions) and the block reward becomes less relevant as it shrinks and eventually stops. The block reward is there to help bitcoin through its early years until the network is at a level of processing a few million transactions a minute.

It hit $170 and the bulls came out in force to grab what they considered a bargain. The stayed &lt;$200 for like an hour. Its been hovering about $220 for a while and there's been a couple of bear attacks but it hasn't gone below $210. I think the bears would have to fight it down to &lt;$190 before the bottom would fall out of the market, and there's a hell of a lot of bulls between here and $190. Its not impossible but I just don't think its likely. I think the bear market that has been in force certainly since July (I'd argue since MtGox) really has finally bottomed out. No one is in a rush to advance, after such a vicious decline, but the bears aren't having much luck getting it any lower either I think we're just going to bounce around between $210 and $250 for a while until people become convinced the decline really has ended. Once it goes back above $250 and stays there people will start to jump on the "the price is going up again :)" wagon.

This is basically the financial Gestapo. This is how it starts. This is the soft tyranny where they try to kill you with paper work. Close your bank account etc. Next you'll see no fly lists, cancelled passports and other travel restrictions. Then that's when the hard tyranny of boot grinding your face into the ground starts. 
Make an escape plan. Mike is right about being well armed but he's one man. I don't care if you are armed like Neo from the Matrix one man with a lot of guns is no match for 10 men with guns. Especially well trained men with guns. My advice is have an escape plan. Be prepared to leave the country on short notice and be able to take a lot of money with you. Convert it to bitcoin put it in a brain wallet or something.

I'm encouraged by articles like this. I think people are finally waking up to the simple truth that the government is not your friend. Government is control. Government is power. Power and control over you, and it always wants more.
I think bitcoin is actually fuelling that. I came to bitcoin via my libertarian values but I think a lot of people are coming at it from the other side now. They discover bitcoin, and then realise what they've been missing all along. Its not until they taste freedom that they realise they didn't have it, and now they're pissed off.

Here's a tip:
Download a smart phone wallet, and use the camera to scan the QR code to your code storage. Save that code to your address book. When you meet the person and pay them the cash, go into your address book and hit "show QR code" on your phone screen and although they scan that, it goes straight to your paper wallet. And then yeah just search the address on blockchain.info and you should see the transaction.

Nothing. His funds are not moving right now so if the private keys are burned and they never move, then nothing ever happens. In fact we have no way of knowing whether or not Satoshi's bitcoins have ALREADY been destroyed. For all we know Satoshi died some time in the last 6 years and his/her fortunes are lost.
But even if we assume Satoshi is alive and well and in possession of their private keys, it still wouldn't have much of an effect on the price. Satoshi has about 1 million coins, which currently represents about 7% of the coins mined so far. So if Satoshi dumped them all, you get is a 7% price drop. But as of right now Satoshi's bitcoins are worth close to $300 million US dollars. That would be very hard to liquidate in a short space of time. What's he going to do find a buyer with $300 million to spare? Even selling his bitcoins in blocks of 1000 BTC at a time (so each block would be close to $300,000) he would still have to sell 1000 blocks.
So Satoshi has so many bitcoins there are certain practical limitations on how quickly they could exit bitcoin if they tried. Which means that a "flash crash" caused by Satoshi dumping a million bitcoins on the market just cannot happen.
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:13:22
I think Satoshi whoever he/she/they are is in a bit of a bind. They actually cannot spend their bitcoins without giving away their identity. If bitcoins reach $1,000 again then Satoshi is in US dollar terms a billionaire. An anonymous billionaire that just pops up out of nowhere that wouldn't go unnoticed and it would not take long to put 2 and 2 together since Satoshi's bitcoins would be seen moving on the blockchain.
Satoshi has, and will for a long time yet, make a lot of very powerful people very angry. If Satoshi outed himself how long do you think it would be before he was assassinated in the name of "national security"? Or maybe they would just arrest him for some made up charge and he'd spend the rest of his life in Gitmo and his million bitcoins would be auctioned off by the US Marshals.
Satoshi's life might well rely on the fact that no one knows who that really is. If he reveals himself either on purpose or just by spending some of his bitcoins they've just made themselves a massive target.

It might stop them getting into this mess again but it can't save them from their immediate situation. Its not as if they can pay back their debt with bitcoin (although that would be awesome since one coin would have to be 100's of times its current value). They borrowed money and now there's no way in hell they can pay it back so they're going to have to default. There's no way but the hard way.

Depends where you live. Here in the UK I use Bitbargain since I can pay using my online banking. In the US I hear Coinbase is good.
As for securing bitcoin if you are a long term holder I'd recommend a paper wallet. You see you don't actually hold the bitcoin they're held in the blockchain (its kind of like the cloud) what you actually hold are the private keys; the access codes to those bitcoins.
If you aren't planning on spending them any time soon if you are a buy and hold investor like I am you can make paper wallets where you print out your private keys on paper from an offline computer and then send the bitcoin to those.
That's called "cold storage" where you make private keys from an offline system. Very secure method of holding bitcoin just put the paper in a safe or something.

From what I've heard this kind of facility was actually included in the original core code by Satoshi. It was taken out so the code could be improved but I imagine it would be reintroduced soon (much like multisig).
Bitcoin has escrow facilities built in that can operate on a time delay and if the transaction was cancelled the funds would default back to the sending address. If it was left to go ahead the funds would move to the receiver's address and then could not be recovered so it would still be irreversible after that point.
Bitcoin is programmable money so there's really no limit to the functionality that can be put into it.

I'll tell you exactly what I did for my 21 BTC. I find the best solution is to go low tech so what I did was get an old laptop (I had one lying around, so old it doesn't even have wi fi and takes about 30 minutes to boot up, but then I only needed it to work once) and load up a paper wallet generator. If you don't have an old computer lying around you can probably get one for 50 euros remember it only has to work once. Think of it as buying peace of mind.
I ran the paper wallet generator offline (this laptop will never connect to the internet so these private keys are guaranteed cold) and I printed 5 copies of the same wallet. I also BIP38 encrypted it so it requires the private key AND a password to redeem the funds.
Put them in sealed envelopes and then into waterproof plastic ziplock bags. I kept 2 in my house at different points, one with my parents, one with my brother, and one with my best friend. So if my house ever burned to the ground I have 3 redundant back ups of my private key.
Even if someone say broke into my parents house and stole a copy of the wallet, its still useless to them without the password. The only other person who has both a copy of the wallet AND knows my password is my brother. He also has 21 BTC and I hold copies of his and know his password. The idea being if anything ever happened to one of us the other would inherit the coins.
I have admittedly gone "full Batman" on this but I basically said to myself "pretend this is £10 million. What security steps do you take?" and worked from there.

OK i've got good news and bad news. The good news is you shouldn't have any trouble getting the coins out of the bitcore address once its sync'd with the network. The bad news is you'll just have to wait. If you leave your computer running non-stop it should sync in about 2 days or so. After that you can send the bitcoins out as normal. Pain in the ass I know, but you shouldn't have any problems once its synced up.
@_date: 2015-02-06 09:46:27
I'm in the exact same boat as you I have 21 BTC and I'm holding on to them for the long haul (I'm thinking around the 10 year mark). I'm not going to be selling them any time soon that's for sure, and at 21 coins I'm not going to be buying any more, so I really shouldn't be paying attention to the price....but I do I check it several times a day but I'm really trying to stop that habit. If I can get it down to once a week that would be acceptable. Maybe start an AA group for obsessive bitcoin price checkers.
I'm going to sell once bitcoin's price only fluctuates a few percentage points year on year. That's when I would know bitcoin has made most of the gains its going to make. At that point I would sell most of it and divest into other assets.

I would say they are evil to be perfectly honest. Historically the reason we ended up with a fiat currency system was war. Specifically World War 1. Everyone expected the the war to be over by Christmas 1914 (which would make the whole thing about 6 months long) because it would run out of money. It would have as well, but they came off the gold standard and implemented the "my bank balance is what I say it is" standard so that they could finance the war. That's why it lasted as long as it did that's why the 20th century was so bloody; unlimited money for unlimited war.
In 1930ish (can't remember exactly) it was made illegal for US citizens to own gold, and they were forced (under penalty of 10 years in federal prison) to "sell" their gold to the government for $20 an ounce. Then the government devalued the dollar relative to gold by 40%, taking it to $35 per ounce. This amounted to nothing more than 40% confiscation of the wealth of the American public, and the whole reason for it was so the US could pay off war debt. And the whole reason the US even got involved in WW1 was so that Woodrow Wilson could get America a seat at the peace talks where the spoils of war would be divided up. He wanted a piece of it. That to me is evil. That's an immoral system that is a mafia if you ask me. Its a form of slavery. Your time and energy, your productivity, used as collateral.

Its easy to keep subdividing a single bitcoin. If we reached the point where 1 satoshi was worth say the equivalent of $20 today, so you'd need to make change of 1 satoshi, then it would be fairly easy to simply add a few more zeros after the decimal and make a satoshi divisible to another 8 decimal places, and so on forever.

On the plus side, the prior crash took the price down to $170. This time the bears are throwing everything they've got at it and they can't seem to breach $210 (think the price just touched $212 before bouncing back up to about $219 or so), so its a "higher low".
No one is freaking out because I think we all know the bears are running out of ammo, and while it might do this a couple more times the long term downward trend that's been in force since July is ending.
I'd be surprised if we see a breach below $200, and I'd be absolutely astounded if we saw it go below $170. Not saying it couldn't happen I just don't see how its possible.

I'm probably going to get a lot of crap for this but I do think that the price has gone as low as its going to get.

I think the price is bouncing along the bottom before it starts a long term trend of increasing price, so if you're gonna buy do it now.

I would say yes. An economic crash would drive people into alternative investments to protect their wealth. Gold, silver, even fine art, all of these can be safe havens and now bitcoin can be too. In the event of a crash I think we'd see a lot of dislocated money flowing in to bitcoin.

There are 3 main reasons. The first is that the government calculates inflation using the consumer price index, and then manipulates it to suit itself. They have a list of 24 common goods (bread, milk, eggs, petrol etc) and they pick 10, average out the percentage cost increase on last year, and that gives them the inflation rate.
However, the 10 that they choose change every year. If petrol was on the list last year because it only went up 1%, and this year it went up 10%, they take it off the list and swap it with say eggs that only went up 2%. They'll always just pick the lowest 10 to suit themselves.
The second reason is that all of the QE money is just sitting there. Inflation is not a measure of the money supply but money supply x velocity. Its only as excess money circulates through the economy that inflation kicks in. What's happened here is that there was a big QE program, they handed the money to the banks, and the banks sat on it. It makes them look (on paper) solvent when they are not. Its only once this money starts to make the rounds in the economy that we will see the inflation. Of course all this means is that the banks are sitting on an inflation time bomb.
Lastly, fractional reserve lending is down. People are, unbelievably, quite sensible. Or at least they are these days. People are tightening their belts, living within their means, NOT taking on debt, and paying off existing debt as fast as they can. Fractional reserve is nothing but debt its money loaned into existence.
The whole system feeds on debt it needs debt to work, and it needs ever increasing levels of debt. So, for the economy at large, people getting OUT of debt is actually a bad thing. They aren't borrowing, so no new money is being created, and they are paying off debt, which destroys currency (when you pay back a unit of debt with a unit of currency, they cancel out).
That's the problem the government is facing they need people to take on debt and they just won't and that's why western economies are going into, oh horror of horrors, deflation.

1. You don't need to download the entire blockchain to use bitcoin.
2. Mass storage is getting cheaper and cheaper every year. Right now a 2TB hard drive is like $100 on Amazon. In 5 years you'll be able to get 10TB for the same money. So even a 100GB blockchain would be 1% of your computer's memory.

Wallets don't have any bitcoins in them. I know sounds weird. Honestly the nomenclature in bitcoin is terrible. Wallets do not hold any bitcoin the bitcoins are held in the blockchain which is a universal ledger. Any attempt to screw with it would simply result in that copy being rejected. In order to be accepted all copies must agree. The only way to forge a bitcoin is to hack all copies of the blockchain at the same time, which would require literally billions of dollars worth of computer power and come the next block (about once every 10 minutes) everyone watching the network would be able to see what was happening.
All wallets actually hold are access codes. The bitcoins are held in the blockchain and everyone can get a copy of it. Technically I have all 14 million bitcoins on my computer right now since I run a full node. I can't spend them though, I don't have the codes.

That's why bitcoin is going to be huge; resilience. Our entire financial system is a house of cards build on a table with missing legs. People need to feel secure and bitcoin while volatile has proven itself over and over. The more it honey badgers on, the more confidence people will have in it.

In general yes but I would not buy right this minute. Price has gone from 220 to 300 in a very short space of time. Typically a rally such as thing one will retrace about 70% of its gains once it tops out, so even if this rally goes over the 300 mark I still expect it to drop to 260 or so.

Its a false dichotomy. Its not all or nothing its a question of how much volatility will people tolerate. If volatility is X (we'll imagine X is some high figure) then only a few people with high risk tolerance will be willing to enter the market, but the fact that they are means adoption has gone up, and volatility goes down a little.
Volatility goes down a little, and another few people with an only slightly lower volatility tolerance than the first batch are attracted into the market, so adoption grows and volatility goes down.
And so on and so on until everyone is using it and volatility is so low even the most conservative users don't pay attention to it.

A banker might want what's best for his country, but I bet he wants what's best for himself more. Its very profitable for him to play within the current system, and it would be a great personal cost to him to try to change it. The incentive structure is set up that its not worth while to try and overthrow the system.

Hmm doubtful. Little bit of arithmetic if you take the current market cap ($3.54 billion USD according to Winkdex), then the current 7% jump represents an increase in market cap of about 247 million dollars. That's a lot of money flowing into bitcoin in a really short space of time. Greece only has a population of about 11 million.
I think the price jump is technical rather than news related I think the bulls are finally having their day, but all that means is that soon bitcoin going to start looking really attractive if you're a Greek. Or anyone living in the Eurozone for that matter.

That's where the miners come in. They DO make money from it because they expend computer power to verify transactions and every block they "solve" pays out 25 freshly minted bitcoins.

I think you're right but not because of the block reward halving. I think what will happen over the next 2,3 or 4 years is all these bitcoin start ups we keep hearing about, all this VC money pouring into bitcoin, is going to start to bear fruit.
That's how the news can be so good and the price decline so relentless; these companies aren't doing anything yet. They are not adding value to the network. I think the bitcoin infrastructure of 3 years from now will look vastly different to the bitcoin infrastructure as it exists now.
I think that has to happen before lots of people can start getting paid in bitcoin, or before big investment firms will start recommending to their high value clients that they use bitcoin as a store of value.
Bitcoin has a lot of growing up to do, and its painful to watch believe me as a long term hodler this is really disheartening to watch the price get pulled further and further down but my advice to anyone thinking of cutting their losses and just getting out of bitcoin is the same advice I give myself; suck it up. Bitcoin will get through this.

The concern is that it will lead to centralisation of mining, which is against the general ethos of bitcoin. Personally, I think it, along with Moore's law, will lead to mining *standardisation*. We're all signing from the same hymn book now as far as mining hardware goes (16mn or nothing), which means the little guy can use the same kind of mining units as the big operations.

Its designed to mimic precious metals. Over time the amount of gold and silver we dig out of the ground every year tends to decrease, because what's left gets rarer and harder to dig out. So Satoshi designed bitcoin to run on a rail pretty much, with a predictable ever-constricting supply, just like metals.

China. They are by far the biggest buyers and the Chinese government is hell bent on devaluing the Yuan into hyperinflation.
I know this is an economically literate crowd but just for the uninitiated, devaluation makes your currency cheaper and therefore your exports cheaper, the idea being to stimulate the economy with increased overseas demand. But really all you've done is given the entire population a pay cut. You never want to win a currency war because it means you're broke.
Regular people in China are running to bitcoin as a safe haven asset. If you have the equivalent of $100,000 saved in Yuan, and they devalue their currency 4%, you've just lost $4,000. The people of China are realising they're better off taking their chances with bitcoin, and there's a *billion* of them.

I had a money tin (just to throw spare change in, like a swear jar) and I recently emptied it and it had over £200 in it. I had to sit for an hour and sort the coins by type, and bag them up into little plastic bags in denominations of £20 for £1 coins, £10 for the 50p coins, £5 for the 20p coins and so on in that order, and I still had a lot of miscellaneous left over because I didn't have exact change to round it off.
I then had to wait until Saturday (because I work 9-5 and can't get to a bank) and go down to my bank branch on a Saturday morning, and stand in line for 20 minutes to pay  these damn bags of cheap metal into my account so its in a form I can use in a more practical manner.
This is finance in the 21st century? Sitting there counting out those damn bags really hit home how archaic our banking system is it made me feel like I was living in the 1800's. What took me almost a week to get done would have been done instantly with bitcoin. Humans will do anything in the name of convenience, and that's why bitcoin is going to win.

I'd be amazed if such a calculation is possible because my suspicion is that no one actually has any clue exactly how much money is in the system. If you take all of the debt (federal, state, municipal, personal and unfunded liabilities like pensions) and add it all up, its somewhere between 100 and 200 trillion USD. That's a pretty vague estimate if you can only narrow it down to a range of 100 trillion dollars. I don't think that's because the people that do the calculations are stupid I think its just the best they can do with the data they have. 
I might be wrong I'd be fascinated if someone has some kind of accurate picture and I'd be even more interested to learn how they came up with it, but I certainly haven't heard of a way.

If the bitcoin blockchain processed as many transactions as Visa that's about 100,000 per minute. That would grow the blockchain by 14 terabytes every 10 days. So about 500 TB per year.
Right now, a 1 TB hard drive is about £40 off Amazon (about $60 USD). Therefore by Moore's law I will be able to buy a 2 TB hard drive for £40 in 18 months time. 10 doublings (15 years) would mean I would be able to afford a 1,000 TB hard drive, for still only ~60 US dollars.
Granted 15 years is a long time, but if you wanted to spend $120 dollars you could double your hard drive capacity. Considering an ASIC miner unit costs upwards of $1,500 USD, a hundred bucks for a hard drive is a cost that is "in the noise".
Lets say the blockchain grew to picobyte size within the next 5 years. Well we already know the average user does not have to download the entire blockchain to use bitcoin, so we can ignore them. We're talking specifically about miners and other businesses/technical users that need the full blockchain.
5 years that's 3 doublings which means 8 TB for our 40 quid. 1,000 TB would therefore cost about 5 grand, or the cost of 2 above average ASICS. Its still not prohibitive.
Lets say the bitcoin got truly monstrous. Then you could use partial blockchains where most people only had a portion (the last 1 million blocks say, which is about 15 years worth) that would be sufficient for miners and hobbyists what you would have are archival nodes that take the blockchain all the way back to the genesis block, and are maintained by organisations to whom cost is not an issue. Companies like Google, and IBM. This would not be a case of "centralisation" since there would still be hundreds of these "archival nodes" running world wide so it is still distributed.
Blockchain size just will not be a problem.

No it can't sit there forever because what will happen is that these massively over leveraged banks (what's when they assets of say 1 billion, but are gambling with 40 billion) are going to implode. If something goes wrong maybe Greece exits the Eurozone, these banks have to liquidate their assets to cover their liabilities (basically they need to sell their house to pay their gambling debts otherwise its breaky leg time)
When this happens (and it will they can only trade on a knife edge and get away with it for so long) all this currency they are holding back is going to flood into the economy in a really short space of time and send the inflation rate sky rocketing.

Probably just market dynamics. The price was totally flat after a protracted decline and it cannot just go sideways forever, so it was either breakout to the downside or breakout to the upside.

This idea that a currency should be inflationary because it encourages spending is pure Keynesian nonsense. You cannot spend your way to wealth. The idea that because bitcoins are deflationary and (on average) gain value over time therefore would not be spend is empirically false.
Look at computers. If I spend $2,000 on a top of the line computer today, I can literally get twice as much computer for the same money if I wait about 18 months, and 4 times as much computer if I wait just 3 years. 16 times as much computer in 6 years. So why would I ever buy a computer if I can get a better one if I hold out just a bit longer? By the logic of the Keynesians, no one would ever buy a computer. That's not how humans operate eventually you decide I really want/need a computer and you just buy the damn thing.
I'm holding on to my bitcoins just now because its early days and I want to see where this is going, but I am going to spend them eventually. There's no point being the richest bitcoin millionaire in the cemetery.

Yeah don't do that. Encrypting your wallet is fine that's a reasonable security step if you want to be really careful (say we're dealing with a large amount) but you don't want to make it so secure you cannot get your bitcoins out. It has happened. People go too far with bitcoin security and accidentally create what is essentially an unspendable address. They've locked up their bitcoin and threw away the key. One BIP38 encryption passphrase is enough.

There has only been 1 block reward halving in the history of bitcoin, so you cannot make any kind of statistical analysis or prediction. 2 points make a straight line not a pattern, and 1 point is not even that. Once bitcoin has been through several block reward halvings we will be able to look at past events to get an idea what to expect at the next. But 1 can just as easily be coincidence.

Meaningless question really because the dollar is constantly losing value. I actually have a $100 trillion dollar bill. Its real it is 2008 Bank of Zimbabwe its the highest denomination bill ever printed, and its absolutely worthless. It has no monetary value but people buy them on ebay as collectables.
So if the dollar went into hyperinflation, we could all be trillionaires, and still be dirt poor. I think Satoshi has a good chance of becoming, by quite a margin, the world's richest person in the not so distant future, but to use the word "trillionaire" is to denominate his wealth in current dollar terms, which would probably be obsolete in a world where Satoshi holds that title.

Its probably very secure from hackers. The risk here is Coinbase itself. This is what happened with MtGox. MtGox had "custodial accounts" where they held their customer's private keys and when MtGox imploded the private keys went with them and the customers are screwed.
Its antithetical to the whole point of bitcoin. Bitcoin is a trustless network. So why introduce unnecessary trust? Why make a vulnerability when there's no need for it? The NUMBER ONE rule of bitcoin is you hold private keys, your bitcoin. You no hold private keys, you no hold bitcoin.
If Coinbase just disappeared tomorrow, its taking your bitcoins with them and there is nothing you can do about it.
If you want to hold large amounts of bitcoin for the long term like I do here is exactly what I did:
Old crappy laptop (barely even works any more), run it offline and never connect it to the internet ever again. Load up a paper wallet generator from a flash drive. Print 5 copies of the same paper wallet and include a BIP38 encryption passphrase. This 2 factor authentication means that if someone found my private keys lying in the street, they still could not access my bitcoins because as soon as they tried they would be asked to confirm the password.
I keep 2 copies in my house, I left one with my parents, one with my brother, and one with my best friend as back ups, and my brother is the only other person who knows the password so he can redeem the money if anything ever happened to me.
So my bitcoins basically cannot be stolen by any means. They are 100% "cold" being generated offline. If a thief breaks into my house and steals my paper wallet I have 4 backups in different locations and the paper wallet is useless without the password anyway.
Be your own bank use bitcoin the way it was designed to be used. Learn the lessons of MtGox.

Bitcoin has the network effect behind it. The more useful it becomes, the more people accept it, and the more useful it becomes. Bitcoin has such a massive headstart it would be very unlikely for another alt coin to over take it.
As for governments creating their own, who cares. Most dollars are already digital the difference is they are not scarce. No government would ever opt for a blockchain based, algorthmically limited currency. It WANTS to be able to print at will they will not give that up.

First off I'm very sorry for your loss. I have a brother I don't know what would happen if he died. But we also plan for this we know the private keys to each other's bitcoin holdings. If one of us ever passed away, the other is to inherit the coins.
Electrum is just a desktop client. The fact that you have it loaded up and it is showing a balance means you probably already have full access. If you want to be sure, try doing a test transaction. Create a new wallet, and see if you can send a dollar or something from the first wallet to the new one. If it asks for a password, you better hope it was something obvious or something a close family member would know. If it goes through, then you can spend the rest of them in the same manner. 
8 BTC is over $1,000 so if you are planning on keeping them I'd look into cold storage options. Its a lot of money to keep on a computer that's attached to the internet.

I think real stability (where the price of bitcoin does not fluctuate more than a percentage point or 2 per year) is still years away. Bitcoin cannot stabilise and grow rapidly at the same time that's a contradiction in terms. I think bitcoin is going to grow exponentially and stability, which would be a benefit for bitcoin the CURRENCY and store of value, will come like 10 years from now.
Detractors say bitcoin cannot be used as a currency because its too volatile. Well it also has a 3 billion dollar market cap that's not a currency. I expect the use of bitcoin to evolve as bitcoin itself evolves and grows.

The display is how much of the blockchain you have to download, not how long it will take you to do that. Starting from scratch and running your PC non-stop will sync the entire blockchain in about 48 hours. Right now its about 28GB all in.
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE FULL BLOCKCHAIN TO USE BITCOIN. Very common noob mistake. You don't need the full chain to use it you can download a smartphone app to hold bitcoin. You can download Multibit or Electrum which are desktop clients which do not download the full blockchain.
You don't need to run a full node (although it is much appreciated if you do :) ) and if you're new to bitcoin its probably better if you don't.

There's a difference between investing and trading. Trading is where you buy and sell bitcoins every day, and the profits you make are income. While this can be profitable its also risky, and I'd advise against it unless you have trading experience and really know what you're doing.
The alternative, and this is what I do, is INVEST in bitcoin where you just buy and hold. Stockpile the stuff. Buy, hold, store under mattress. A simple strategy but if you are thinking long term (5+ years) I think it will pay off in the end.

Because they gave that money to the banks, and its just sitting there. Inflation is correctly defined as an increase in the supply of currency, however to see prices increase (which is usually mis-termed "inflation") you need inflation x velocity.
Velocity is a measure of how money moves through the economy. How often does it change hands? The velocity of all this extra printed currency is zero. Its not moving. Its locked away. As far as the economy at large is concerned, it doesn't exist.
But its only a matter of time before that money *does* make its way into the wider economy, and then we will see rising prices. The banks are sitting on an inflation time bomb.

The proposed block size increase would not make block sizes bigger, what it would be increasing is the CAP on how big a single block can be. The current 1MB limit is not a fundamental problem in the bitcoin code but an arbitrarily limit imposed out of convenience.
I think $200 is a good place to buy. I obviously cannot promise it won't go lower than that, but I don't think it will I think we've hit the bottom. At the end of the day you could drive yourself crazy wondering whether you should buy now or wait and see if it drops another $50, and before you know its $350 a coin and you wished you'd just bought the damn thing at $220. I think we all believe a bitcoin will be worth a lot more than that in 5 years away, regardless of what happens over the next few weeks or months.

Forex traders speculate with US dollars all the time but as a percentage of users they must be 0.00001% or something like that.
As for the bitcoin whales. Well lets say bitcoin is worth $100,000 a coin and you are Satoshi Nakamoto and you have 1 million bitcoins. You can't sell that. That's 100 billion dollars there's no way you can move that kind of money in one go, and with say 20 million bitcoins in the world, he's only increased the liquidity pool a few percent so its hardly going to bomb the price.

I don't think we're even at "store of value" stage bitcoin is too volatile for that. If we're just taking about bitcoin as a new kind of money (and not the other applications of such a network) then it really should be filed under "speculative asset". Bitcoin does need stability but it needs GROWTH first. Bitcoin right now is $3 billion dollars its the underdog. It needs to grow to several hundred billion dollars at least and then it can challenge the world's largest fiat currencies on their own ground. So I don't worry about volatility I think bitcoin needs it because it needs to grow fast. If it stabilised now it would just be stunted.

This "problem" will likely come and go without anyone realising. This is the "Y2K" of bitcoin its all hype. Bitcoin as it is now as 2 major limitations it has a 1MB block size limit and a 7 transactions per second limit. Both of these limits are artificially imposed and not inherent to the architecture.
These limits where put in to the original code as a convenience they can removed when they become restrictive. A trillion transactions a day is not going to happen any time soon, 15-20 years anyway, by which time bandwidth and mass data storage will be dozens of times what it is today. Right now I can get a 60 megabit internet connection for about $40 a month. In 20 years it will be a 60 gigabit connection for the same price. This is like someone in 1999 with a 56k dial up modem saying that the internet will never able to stream HD video.

You could trade them. Sell them at a higher price and buy them back when the price drops, either keeping the extra coins or keeping the same amount of coins and the difference being your profit. Or margin trading where you bet on the direction of the price change. The thing about that though is that you really have to know what you are doing. Its a gamble and sooner or later you're going to get caught out and make a big loss.
I do a little bit of it for fun but 97% of my bitcoins are sitting in cold storage and that's where they are staying. If you've got $75,000 dollars worth then you must be sitting on around 300 bitcoins. Why not just sit on them and wait for the price to go up in a few years? Getting greedy is how you make mistakes. Just play it safe especially if you're talking about that kind of money.

Yes that's called M0. Or M1 I can't remember if the scale starts at 0 or 1. That's the physical stuff whether paper or metal coins its stuff you can actually hold in your hand. That's by far the smallest part. On top of that you have all of the money that only exists in a computer. For every dollar they physically print, they just type 100 more into a computer. Then there's all the fractional reserve then on top of that you have derivatives and ETF's and all that other stuff it goes to M3 I think and each layer becomes more abstract.

This proves bitcoins are better than gold; they cannot be counterfeited. Hollowed out gold bars are a problem and like the article says they are very hard to spot, whereas the odds of receiving a double spent bitcoin are practically zero.

I don't think we'll see any real movement until after March 5th (US Marshal Silk Road auction). The bears can't get the price lower but the bulls don't want to charge in until they see what the results of the auction are. My guess is the auction in itself will have no effect on price, and then the bulls confidence will pick up.

I see. This is pretty much along the lines of what I thought it would be, and my concern here is that ETF's will be used to get around/dilute the 21 million coin limit hard coded into Bitcoin.
I know this what's going on with silver in the CoMex there's something like 500 times as many receipts for silver as there is actual hold in your hand silver. I could see a situation like that arise in bitcoin where the price is set by the "paper" bitcoin, and there's a billion paper bitcoins traded on ETF's while the actual bitcoin network just dies.

@_date: 2015-02-11 18:18:00
1. The number of bitcoins in circulation is capped at 21 million. Fiat can be printed ad infinitum.
2. The fact that they hold more gives them no more control over the system than anyone else. In bitcoin, the rich got rich by being early, so good for them. In fiat, the rich get rich by manipulating the system, and siphoning off the wealth of the middle class. 
A man who buys 10 bitcoins for $1,000 one year, has caused you no injury if you come in a year later and the price of bitcoin is $1,000 a piece.
3. Fiat is enforced by violence. You MUST use it. You have no choice. It is the currency of slaves. They ensure you must use it, by making you pay your taxes in it, and punishing you for using alternatives (for example here in the UK, silver is subject to 20% VAT).
Bitcoin is voluntary no one can force you to use it you are entirely free to take it or leave it.

I'm chalking this up to cold feet. Pre-halving jitters. This is a once in 4 year event and its the first one that really matters, since the first halving was in 2012 and bitcoin was like $10 and no one had ever heard of it. This is the first halving that is really on everyone's radar. We're facing it with a combination of excitement and trepidation. I'm not surprised the price dropped, just due to the "trepidation" part. Give it a few weeks let things adjust to the "new normal" of 12.5 coins per block.

As far as nomenclature goes I'm trying to promote the "μbit". The "μ" (pronounced "you") is SI unit for 10^-6, so 1 μbit is a millionth of a bitcoin, or 100 satoshis.
Using bits or "millibits" is confusing because it sounds too much like how we measure internet bandwidth. So μbits is distinct enough to not be confused with mbps, is already derived from the International System of Units, and if 1 μbit achieved dollar parity it means 1 BTC is worth $1,000,000 :-)

No that is not fractional reserve. All that person has done is bid up the price of bitcoin. If it becomes a trend then the price of a single bitcoin will rise.

I've been sitting on my stash for about 3 years now, and I'm holding for at least another decade. I've got more than 10, less than 100, bitcoins in cold storage and I'm holding them purely as a speculative investment. Yes its an interesting tech and all that but I'm not a dev, I'm not even particularly great with computers, I'm just in it for the money.
I think of the best use cases for bitcoin is store of value. Traditionally store of value is gold, and the market cap of gold is what? 7 trillion? If bitcoin captured 10% of that it still puts the price of a single bitcoin at about 70+ times what it is today. That's all I did.
@_date: 2016-07-24 13:41:27
I don't think history matters to be quite honest. Gold has been around for 5,000 years and bitcoin has been around for 5 years but I don't think that's any reason to think bitcoin could not aggressively eat into the store of value market currently dominated by gold. The largest economy in the world is the internet, and that's only 25 years old.
Is anything under $2,000 a good buy in price? If you are looking to hold for years then I'd say yes. I know people who bought in a 450 who are ready to cash out (permanently) if it hits $1,000. Personally I don't understand that but whatever. But if you are willing to go the distance and sit on your bitcoins for 10, 12, 15 years then I think even 2 grand a coin is cheap. There's only 21 million of these things I don't think bitcoin could still *exist* in 15 years if it was *only* $2,000 a coin. That would basically mean it has failed.
I don't have a process for determining a good enough fall. When the price started dropping in June 2014 I knew the mgtox bubble had not finished yet, but I had no idea how low it would go. It ended up going down to $170 I did NOT see that one coming. I just kept buying at regular intervals (a fixed $$$ amount every couple of weeks) and because I keep buying on the way down it pulls down my average. My average per coin buy in cost (if we ignore the ones I picked up pre-2013 spike) is about $210, even though I started buying at $600.
I think trying to time it or call the top/bottom is bordering on divination. Its probably no more accurate than a coin flip.

The price of a transaction is determined by its size in kilobytes not monetary value. If the transaction is the same size in kilobytes then the fee will be the same so yes as a percentage a smaller transaction would have a larger fee. But on an absolute scale the fee is just a couple of cents anyway so it doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:17:03
QE happens because governments are terrified of deflation. Now deflation (in an asset based system like gold or bitcoin or whatever) is a good thing because that means stuff is cheaper tomorrow. When you go to the gas pump and it costs you 10% less to fill the tank, that's kinda nice. That means you have 10% left over to do something else with whether that's save it or spend it on something else.
But governments hate deflation because it rewards savers but punishes debtors. If you owe $1000 today, in a deflationary system $1000 is actually MORE money a year from now. So the incentive is not to get into debt. Governments are the biggest debtors by far, and rather than pay the money back what they want to do is make the problem go away by causing inflation. That what they can inflate their debts away rather than pay them back.
Because people aren't taking on debt, we're going the other way we're going back into deflation, so the governments are trying to brute force inflation by just printing a lot of money, and when that doesn't work they'll print more, and when that doesn't work they'll print more, and so on. If it doesn't work the solution is "you didn't do enough of it".
Fiat currencies are not necessarily a one way trip to inflation, but they are a one way trip to collapse. I said earlier that DEFLATION is a good thing in an asset based system (like a gold standard), and that is true. But we don't have an asset based system we have a DEBT based system.
A debt based system is fundamentally unstable. From day one it is doomed to fail, either by inflation or deflation it doesn't really matter the end result is the same. Mike Maloney's video series is spot on (cannot recommend his material enough). When you create a unit of currency, you create lets say 2 units of debt (its not a 2:1 ratio in reality, but there must always be MORE debt than currency created). So you now owe 2 units, so you create 2 more and now you have 3 units of currency and 6 units of debt, and so on. When you pay back a unit of debt with a unit of currency you cancel out at a 1:1 ratio, but you STILL have that remainder of debt and nothing to pay it with.
That's why the system collapses you either keep creating money and debt until the proportion of debt to currency grows to unsustainable levels, and collapses. Or, you pay back the debt but as you do that you also remove the currency from the system and again the ratio of debt to currency grows (they are both going down, but currency goes down faster than debt, so the disparity grows), until again there is way more debt than currency, and it collapses.
That's the madness of a debt based fiat system if you take on debt the system collapses if you pay back debt the system collapses.

That's impossible by definition since bitcoin is inherently limited.

The value is very unstable but I don't think it will go to zero. This is like the 7th price crash bitcoin has had and it keeps going. Value will I think remain very volatile for the next few years its a symptom of bitcoin being young and small. It will level off as it grows.
I would not bother mining unless you really know what you are doing. Cloud mining is a scam and should be avoided.
If you are looking to minimise risk and only invest a small amount like 50 or 100 euros, just buy and hold. Buy a bit of bitcoin (maybe buy 1 for about 200 euros) and just sit on it. Buy, hold, and just wait and see.
That's my strategy; keep it simple. I've managed to accumulate 21 BTC (1/1 millionth of all the bitcoins that will ever exist) and my grand plan is to do absolutely nothing with them for the next 10 years.
I'm just going to hold it, try to forget about it, and see what they are worth 10 years from now. It goes to zero it goes to zero. I think it will be one or the other there will be no "middle value" it will either be zero or it will be something incredible like a million dollars a coin.
