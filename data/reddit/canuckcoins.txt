I should add the point of the hashtag  is to help organize support for the individual endeavor! TD;LR use  so individual tweets asking for Bitcoin acceptance are easier to track and support.

Seems a lot of people on reedit threads want Howard to talk Bitcoin. It's not going to happen. This guy "just" discovered Amazon. When it does happen, though, it will be the bellwether that Bitcoin has hit mainstream.

the law was passed after  Canadian senate hearings. We could contact our local representatives, but I don't hold much hope now that it's law.

I think we all know who we are dealing with, but politicians also need votes. They also need education. Are you suggesting we just shut up and let them decide the future without anyone standing up? If nothing less, maybe we can get an MP advocate on our behalf. I mean it's great the Libertarians of Canada take Bitcoin, but they cannot affect policy the way someone in the house can trying to keep a seat...

This is why I am looking for support for Twitter hashtag  so that when you ask a retailer to accept Bitcoin on Twitter (no matter where you are), use the  hashtag so we can see these tweet and support the requests we agree with retweet. I think if a vendor see's interest in their social media, it will increase discussions at the company and lead to more adoption...
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:27:29
That's one of the main issues. They did not define what "dealing" is. In essence the law does not provide clarity so much as it scares me by its lack of detail.
@_date: 2014-01-25 15:35:16
if you notice I said


the point of the hastag is to make it easier for people to see those requests they agree with. I agree with you and this is not an attempt to spam anyone. It's to organize the requests in an easier way for people to support -- but I can see your concern, but hopefully you get where I was coming from. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:53:00
It got royal assent on June 19th, which makes it officially the law. To me that is when it's officially passed. Until that point it's not final, because up until the third read, the wording can change. Nevertheless, the reaction here shows me, this was not truly common knowledge. Thanks to linking to Stu's analysis.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:11:54
ummm it's a wiki... and already changed
"The largest and most trusted exchange is MtGox, however in February 2014 they halted withdrawals which created a lack of confidence and a decline in the price of bitcoin. For a list of other major exchanges see Major Exchanges"

@_date: 2014-07-20 10:27:47
This seems to be missed: "I'm leaning toward coinbase simply because of end user adoption." Bitcoin is not like a credit card. It doesn't matter which service you use to accept Bitcoin, but you will want to use whatever service makes you comfortable, is easy to use and reputable. Coinbase seems to be the most popular, but Bitpay is also a solid choice. You can also look at Coinkite. It's a pretty good option too. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-06-23 10:50:50
TD;LR the Bitcoin legislation warned about is passed. And companies like Coinbase cannot operate in Canada. Bitcoin dealers need to register. Feel that chill? This is the effect of new law passed.

Right, sharing 1 post in Reddit about Gaw makes me a Paycoin shill. Get out your aluminum helmet.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:55:34
I shared 1 post, how is that hypocritical? It was a post about something said related to Bitcoin. My post here is talking about multiple posts about Paycoin which are unrelated to Bitcoin. 
I see your point, but I feel some are missing mine. Not sure spamming the subreddit is most effective.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:49:56
I agree. I think this a fair assessment. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:29:07
Only way to get the message across :) there are currently 10 stories on Paycoin on the main page. The rules of this Subreddit are clear. This has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:43:08
I wish you good luck, but it will be tough.
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:40:57
Paycoin is not Mt.Gox. It's only tangentely related to Bitcoin.You don't need to use Bitcoin. I see your points, but this is no different than any shitty investment one can make. Should this subreddit be about every scam? I'm just saying let's focus it on one or two conversations, we don't need a 100 posts on Paycoin do we?
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:32:48
I have no issue with calling Paycoin troubling, but I do question why there are so many posts in r/Bitcoin about Paycoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:24:55
QuickBT would be my choice

Okay that's a fair point. I didn't see it that way.
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:06:23
Fair enough, that was my point. I guess it will blow over. When I wrote this I was annoyed that literally the homepage had over 10 Paycoin posts all on the same topic.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:41:26
Finally someone who speaks with some sense.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:05:56
I agree. The Paycoin stuff has it's own subreddit. This morning I awoke to over 10 posts on the homepage of r/Bitcoin about Garza or Paycoin. The spreading of information on Hashtalk and r/Paycoin is the better way to go if you want people to know.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:24:09
Bitcoin is innovative, but you also have to handle the fact your investment will face wild swings. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:26:29
I think that is done don't you? I don't think the first page of this subreddit should be about Paycoin and that we keep creating more similar topics about it. That's all I am saying...
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:49:34
I never said we should ignore the issue, I only question the point of giving up the homepage of the Subreddit to Paycoin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:40:24
What find? I made 1 post about something related  to Bitcoin from Gaw. I have upvoted issues with Paycoin. I am just questioning if is the best place to warn about Paycoin. Wow is this a case of if you are not with us you are a Paycoin shill?
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:51:36
Well you are telling to stop talking so obviously you seem to think I have some benefit in quieting down talk about Paycoin. I don't care. I come here to read about Bitcoin, not altcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:56:02

     * Quickbt.com (Small amounts, but fast way to get Bitcoin. Use their spendbt.com service to go from Bitcoin to fiat).
     * Morrex.com (The only exchange to be fully licensed in Quebec by Autorité des Marchés Financiers.)
     * bitcoinbrains.com/ (In person exchange Calgary)
     * TaurusExchange.com
     * Cavirtex.com Under new management April 8th 2015. They were recently bought by coinsetter.com. Canada's first Bitcoin Exchange.
     * Coinsquare.io

I don't disagree there might be fees, but there are some businesses that will never accept Bitcoin. With their card you can pay in Bitcoin, or go to any ATM in Canada and withdraw cash to pay. This essentially throws down the gauntlet to the Bitcoin ATM guys. Cavirtex is working within the system to bring legitimacy to Bitcoin and I am sure fees will drop if the adoption goes up. They've done this with their other solutions in the past.The more options we have the better. And frankly the fact a bank would agree to this means it opens option for competition -- that to me is main reason it's huge.
I should add I don't work for Cavirtex, I'm just a customer. I am impressed they have survived when all other competition has been shut down by banks in Canada. Obviously they are doing something right. I'd ratter pay a little more fees than have my Bitcoins frozen in an exchange collapse.
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:55:00

I don't understand why both solutions can't work? I certainly use Bitcoin where I can, but I think getting into the interac system is a good move. It's instant cash for Bitcoin if you need it.
@_date: 2013-10-04 16:37:41
 is pretty good
@_date: 2013-06-08 16:18:41
All good points. Some people might forget that while a company might accept Bitcoins, those companies have to pay people salaries and order from suppliers. These people might not be so receptive to Bitcoins. In this case, it's not so simple as accepting Bitcoin. They now have the extra step of converting to fiat. Depending on the volume, it might not be worth it. Accepting Bitcoin could thus be an issue or not profitable for them.
@_date: 2013-10-04 10:39:52

Couldn't agree more. That's why I have been disappointed by the non action. Link to another resource, offer the forum in read only, post a message. Their inaction is infuriating, as is this assumption that a forum is not needed by some. A forum for Bitcoin and Reddit can coexist. It is not a zero sum game.

I was happy they allowed email interact transfers because it made getting into Bitcoin trading easier when I first started. It's just too bad that it seems scumbags and crooks outnumber people with good intentions and offering this kind of service to the Bitcoin community is impossible. For Bitcoin to really get mass adoption and allow "regular" people to start using Bitcoin, these types of fraudsters need to stop. They ruin everything for everyone. Hopefully LiberyBit can come back because there is a need for competition. Now Cavirtex has a monopoly in Canada.

I agree. Why not just redirect to another forum or use a different software and import the old one. I found this for smf 1 import.  They also do it as a paid service too, if necessary, which surely can be afforded by all the ad revenue they had: 
@_date: 2013-10-06 13:13:21
I think that's only to start 
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:02:28
the world needs &lt;sarcasm&gt; tags for when you have been up 36 hours straight.
@_date: 2013-05-12 14:03:29
that's what peaked my interest in this thread. who is payward really??? 
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:44:55
Not a real fan of xenforo but it's a 10000% better than smf. Would love to see main Bitcoin forum on Vanilla or Discourse. At least a real modern software!
@_date: 2013-05-13 20:28:25
I tweeted it out for them. I agree it makes sense. I did notice they did post dowtime on Bitcointalk forum too, so that's great too.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:55:03
I think diaspora of knowledge could hurt Bitcoin more than any shut down of a service. Communities help organization. I just hope a clear winner comes forward that works. My main issue was it seemed some Reddit users were down voting other forums or suggesting forums are not needed. To me both Reddit and a strong forum are needed. They each have different functions.
@_date: 2013-10-06 01:23:26
I was just suggesting a forum package. Personally my vote is for Vanilla(Php) I mentioned Discourse because it's on Ruby. I wasn't aware it was so vulnerable. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 12:35:40
Hope he changes software
@_date: 2013-05-21 21:26:15
It's not disputing info from Liberty Bit. The argument is banks wont care what Fintrac says if US gvt hold Fincen over their head. I'm a Liberty Bit customer and it pisses me off to see Canadian banks not follow the rules . Regardless, the article in The Register was misleading. Canada is no haven YET for Bitcoin. We've got work to do :)
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:06:51
Maybe you should start here: 
@_date: 2013-06-08 16:56:01
You should check out coinurl.com, it's even better :)
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:25:20
use a better software though :p
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:07:25
I think this has been tried, but it's really needed in Canada where the Bitcoin market seems under-developed. That's why I created a Canadian Bitcoin Forum. More places us Canucks can get Canada specific advice the better.
@_date: 2013-10-10 18:24:47
I did. But they lost me over how they dealt with things.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:13:46
I tried too, I think something weird is going on their side
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:03:05
Never said it didn't :p I'm here aren't I? Don't you find sometimes the discussions are a bit disjointed? That's why I think a forum has its place in conjunction with Reddit. Remember the million dollar pizza started on Bitcointalk :)
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:46:12
I say it sucks because there are better more modern software that a cutting edge technology could have been using. True other forums have been hacked, but from what I know the forum admin's were lax in patching issues, so maybe it was not a good idea for them to be running it. Their behaviour since it has gone down shows us a lot. Any forum hacked has at least a message page at the old address or a link to a resource. The silence is defeaning.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:39:15
I think the behavior in not taking any action when it's such an important resource, it does not deserve to come back. It's time for a change -- a new forum maybe that imports the old data into an archive section, maybe? 
@_date: 2013-10-04 16:42:11
Sounds like Vanilla Forums is what you want. 
Check out 
 ( bitcoin tipping)
 (reputation system and more)
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:28:05
I have a forum too ( and there are plenty of other forums that look great. One I have found is 
Personally I think a modern currency should be using modern forum software. Anything less doesn't make sense...
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:41:53
It exists 
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:23:30
have you seen a traffic bump?
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:15:48
Good point. But I also want todo more than that. Lots of plans, like a Canadian Faucet ;) 
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:37:38
That's a new one for me  . Thanks for sharing ;)
@_date: 2013-05-07 19:33:08
I agree. With the amount of talk about China and news coverage, the price for BTC should be skyrocketing. Seems like nothing going on price wise --so maybe people in China aren't so swayed by the official party media. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:41:01
Thanks. It was well hidden ;)
@_date: 2013-05-12 13:55:29
The real truth is the following, don't put ANY money into Bitcoin you can't afford to lose. To me,  your first mistake was putting your savings into Bitcoin. I used to gamble at a Casino near here, and lost quite a bit. Like you I learnt my lesson. Eventually you will build your savings up, but what I would do is write a letter to yourself about how you feel right now. The next time you think about gambling, pull out this letter. Hopefully your wife will forgive you, although it may take time. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-06-16 22:36:33
Yes I could have had 100k. But look it this way I could have given away 100k for $500 :) so it's not so bad.
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:07:24
It's a known scam. They should have warned you, but they care more about their take :
@_date: 2013-05-28 01:25:54
I dont think this letter exists as reported.  Even if it did, most Canadian banks don't care because they are worried about Fincen and the USA market which is a big growth area for them.
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:24:18
How much to buy all the copies :p
@_date: 2013-10-04 16:22:20
looks great. big fan of vanilla
@_date: 2013-10-06 01:16:18
Depends. I've run forums for a lot less and I have done all 4. Forums are usually labours of love not money. They are better to be an adjunct of something. Like if the Bitcoin Foundation had a forum...
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:19:21
You can look at the new forum coinforum.ca. I'll be posting how-tos soon from a Canadian specific perspective
@_date: 2013-10-06 01:12:16
I think that makes a lot of sense. Why can't bitcointalk redirect there, and donate the history to them
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:34:26
how many bitcoins were they paid to write that?
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:40:53
I would love to at least see him run it right. Put up a message or a redirect. I think a new modern software like Vanilla or Discourse should be used. Import the old forum and move forward... With or without Bitcointalk.org-- it would also help to get an idea where these discussions are now going. They aren't happening in Reddit. It's not the right format. Topics are fleeting here. I find a forum makes it easier to have discussion...
