Nice answer, thanks a lot! Finally someone could make it clear in laymans terms haha
But, wasnt the block increase to 2MB called SegWIt2x which was rejected and didnt go through?

I actually researched quite a lot. I was reading a number of publications and articles, and while they talked about a lot of good stuff, I simply could not get an answer to this: is it being used already and which part. You summarising it here in this way, got the picture together like the info on the net couldnt do it - for me.

Okay, but currently, real case use of BTC for coffee is not widespread anyway. But to my understanding, using LN would be useful to everyone trading on exchanges already now?
Which then confuses me over the difference between SegWit and LN. Segwit is here and LN is years away. What did Segwit do exactly then?

Okay.. Would exchanges using Segwit speed up actual use of LN? Or its stuck behind technical development from Bitcoin Core ?

It seems that they will:

Thanks for getting back
I thought that raising the blocksize was from SegWit2X which was rejected by the network?
Which is responsible for speeding up transactions and reducing fees, Segwit from August or the Lightning Network that's coming?

Thanks for taking the time to reply. It's really important I understand this for myself. 
So if Coinbase and Binance are not ready, but Bitstamp is, does this mean that Bitstamp is now doing Lightning Network transactions ? Or do they have to wait for Coinbase and Binance in order to maintain people don't lose their assets transferring between ready and not ready services?

Yes, its a double edged problem then. On the one hand, individual exchange investors don't show on the blockchain, since their addresses are tied to a limited big wallets that exchanges hold. In addition that, if we use exchange data on the number of customers they have, we don't know how many of these customers/investors also have accounts on other exchanges.

Would you say then that all the wallets on BitInfoChart have at least a fraction of BTC on them? Never just 0 ?

Thank you for explaining this. So if we want to calculate the number of investors in Bitcoin, we can't do it very well on account of millions of users without personal wallets who operate on exchanges but the exchange may only have a limited number of real wallets, right ?
