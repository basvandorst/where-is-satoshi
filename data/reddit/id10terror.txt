I am out for now since I lost over $40,000 on the so called hack.
I think it's was a sign for me to spend more time outdoors and focus on other things instead of wasting my time watching bitcoinwisdom all day.
EDIT: I hope bitcoin crashes and no one buys anymore. The ecosystem is no longer viable.

You want my opinion?
Keep your damn mouth shut about your financial life...PERIOD! NO EXCUSES!
Don't even discuss salaries, investments, or stocks and definitely don't give financial advice to anyone! 
There are many types of people I avoid interaction/communication with in my professional/personal career/life, but there are two I definitely avoid at all costs; those that gossip and those that are negative. Trust me when I say those two types alone can fuck with your mindset.
And going a bit further, stop with the whole 'attention/approval' seeking behavior.

I don't doubt for a bit as to whether we can quantify the feel or quality of interiors when it comes to super class vehicles.
Do you know the philosophy and history behind Tesla as far as inventor/auto maker?
The reason I would strongly prefer the Tesla as to say a GT-R or LFA has nothing to do with performance or bang for the buck, but rather the technology involved into making the Tesla. Sure, I will nod my head to the Japanese auto makers when it comes to reliability and performance, but at the end on the day Tesla is a stealth fighter with amazing engineering behind that class of vehicle.
You would only understand that the drivers behind the Tesla drive it for a reason and that's to not only give homage to the inventor (the father of AC), but at the same time the vision of the car of the future that could have been invented nearly a century ago (yes, you read this right!).
If you are an engineer, computer science, electrician or someone that appreciates technology then you would only understand and appreciate the history and technology behind Tesla and the vehicle.

To end them.
It's not as simple as production or halting drugs. Weapons, cartels and all sorts of major politically corrupted and people in power is what's keeping the drug war going.
We are losing this battle (rekted if that's the term used correctly) and it's a joke. In the end we may as well legalize some illicit substances.

Articles like this are nothing but a bunch of air and bullshit.
Now, before you downvote me, hear me out.
It's not government or governors that get to decide whether to approve something beyond their control or not, it's we the people and community to decide that we want to use it.
Reading bullshit articles like these only tell me one thing, either they submit to the growing tech now or later. They know they can't do anything about it, so approving BITCOIN in my state is irrelevant. 
I for one, do not care whether governor clown approves this or not since bitcoin doesn't need approval of anything. It's almost like saying they are approving oxygen for the environment for people to breathe and use.

@_date: 2015-05-23 02:42:32
I am actually more curious as to why they stopped (I don't recall giving them permission anyway to regulate).
Probably someone higher up was heavily invested into BTC that they said they wanted to cancel the process to regulate it. 
So yes, I believe government is now invested in BITCOIN.

It's not bitcoin that will destroy financial firms, it's the accountability part of it (hence, the blockchain/world wide ledger) which means the party is about to end for them.
This is the reason why big banks don't want neither Bitcoin or a ledger to succeed.

Not bad for an 8th grade level presentation, although some mention of the current crisis in other countries that were affected and how bitcoin would help in those cases would have been nice.

Include in Dave Ramsey as an advisor (he has a terrible video about bitcoin), but I get your point.
The problem though is that if we want major adoption, the technology has to be simplified and not complicated even more (XT/Classic debates) or sizing. 
If it took Burry weeks to understand when the collapse would happen, it would take him maybe a few months on what bitcoin could do entirely or at least the technology behind it and where it would go.
Either way, I wouldn't disregard anything he would say about cryptos in general.

What's the excuse? Rather, what's the point of the blockchain if we don't verify or use it as intended?
This is why we need to make sure transactions are verifiable in the first place so there's no corruption, lies, or business fraud of any type. Will it prevent it? No, but at least it would be timestamped. 
Many governments refuse to acknowledge bitcoin and ban it instead. They know once the public ledger is accessible to everyone, they can't launder or hide/evade transactions.
Ledgers like the blockchain are the reason we as bitcoin users, must enforce :)

Mid 2010 through a classmate back in college. Back then, I was doing engineering and systems security and since having a huge leg up on technology, jumped in it right away and learned everything about it. I was lucky because I've just purchased a ATI card 5850 that was $400 and took me days before I've finally figured how mining worked.
Few months later, stored a few thousand and didn't sell most until it peaked $250, later some at $1000 and still holding on to enough and now I just daily trade. I don't have a fancy home or expensive car, but I live comfortable now and don't have to stress much about working or making ends.
Friend from college did also the cold storage and already moved out after cashing out and you know the rest pretty much once you have enough money for anything.

It's not that there's anything wrong with bitcoin, it's just that because of the previous history (gox, silk road, hackers) is what made people take an aversion from something that wasn't its fault the way it was meant to be used in the first place.
Back then, AW restaurants were offering people a 1/3 burger which is obviously more meat than a 1/4 (quarter pounder) in which MCDonalds offered a 1/4 pounder because it was simple to the consumer.
What happened next didn't surprise me, typical idiotic and stubborn people always bought the 1/4 pounder because of heavily marketing and people thought they were getting more hamburger for their money when they should have went with the 1/3 burger. Because of this, mostly everyone went with the lesser burger because of the poor advertising and marketing.
This is how I think bitcoin is right now and people are just stubborn and unwilling to understand how it works and what benefits it can bring to personal, businesses and the world. Unfortunately, those that don't want to learn will eventually fail.
People say history repeats itself, well not really but it certainly rhymes.

Look up "modified cable modems" or forceware and you will have your answer (ebay still has them around if you look carefully). 
There's a PDF, really interesting if you are new to the concept of modified cable modems, I would suggest to read it [here](
Some software still works fine with DOCSIS 2 and 3, but the Motorola SB6121 is still the best modem to hack.
I think I've said more than enough.
