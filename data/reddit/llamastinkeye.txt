What a vague, useless story.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:06:30
I watched it and it actually wasn't very informative. More like a very general overview and preaching about security, which I am obviously already concerned about if I am asking this question.
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:17:07
I wonder why everyone always just recommends Trezor, but ok, thanks
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:06:16
It's less than $10k right now :(
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:40:34
Well I obviously didn't see that. I didn't realize fraud on exchanges could do that. I know people wallet's get stolen all the time but I didn't realize security issues could do this. Whatever
edit: I don't see this posted anywhere else under "other discussions"
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:12:04
Well that's a first that anyone said I had a great attitude and welcomed me to the community. lol Sometimes it's a little cultist if you express doubts or questions, and people get mad when you're a clueless dummy (which I am). But I'll try to figure out a proper way to store these. I just don't know about trusting Coinbase...
To everyone's point that all I have is an IOU from Coinbase, all my stocks are an IOU from Fidelity, but Fidelity is heavily regulated and I trust them to actually give me my money back so. The issue for me is more with trusting Coinbase than having "an IOU." So I need to discern how to get them out and save them.

He's rich, he works at a hedge fund. lol I appreciate the gift but I honestly would've preferred cash or something. Especially since I'm poor. :-/
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:07:10
I understand the difference, but I don't know what I am supposed to do. I heard people recommend Ledger and Trezor but... how do I really know they are secure? How do we know we should trust these companies? And I'm not very knowledgeable about this stuff... what if my Trezor battery dies and the device craps out or something? What if the company that makes it goes out of business and I run into issues using it?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:32:20


I think the point is just pointing out there are vulnerabilities in the system. I don't think the point of the article is to shit on BTC but to say that more regulation is needed. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:22:18
It's just very complicated and I *have* done a lot of reading and learning and I _still_ don't understand it. Either way, I want to hold. I have stocks and I am just holding them too.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:32:40
If the Pineapple Fund wants to help out a poor unemployed girl, holler at me. lol
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:13:54
How do I get my coins or keys off them if it dies? How do I know there will be other brands or devices that can recover them?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:55:29
But I keep going back to: Why should I trust them that they aren't going to steal? How do I know it works properly and can't be hacked? What if my Ledger dies or malfunctions? What if the company goes out of business and it stops working? :-/
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:12:03
What are sock puppets? I just thought it was interesting - Paul Krugman doesn't normally tweet about BTC (that I've seen anyway)
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:15:01
This is a good explanation and more clear than their website, honestly, thanks
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:58:43
Thanks for that but... and I don't mean to sound like a dumb-dumb... how do I know Trezor is actually even secure? How do we know we should trust this company? And I'm not very knowledgeable about this stuff... what if my Trezor battery dies and the device craps out or something? What if the company that makes it goes out of business?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:53:11
Something about going to some website like blockchain.info and generating hashes or something. I don't know! If I start putting anything into websites, I'm worried that's not secure either!
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:59:28
All these coins were a Christmas gift. I don't want to deal with them or think about them. I'm just gonna hold and see if they appreciate in value someday. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:23:39
I feel the odds of an active invasion at the time I generate the key isn't really an issue. My biggest concern is one day Coinbase being hacked, or the wallet I use being hacked, or accidentally using a company I shouldn't have trusted who are scammers. That sort of thing.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:57:14
...Uh, I don't know, the way traditional financial assets and currencies are regulated? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:22:43
I looked up a guide on how to do it and it sounded so complicated and made no sense to me. :-/
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:15:43
If I'm going to save a copy of my seed (whatever that means, tbh) then should I just write down all the info for my coins and save them that way? Why use the Trezor at all?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:54:20
I just don't want my Christmas gift stolen. :( I could cash it out, but if any of these coins *do* go up, I'll feel like a chump. lol (When he got it for me, it was worth $4k and now it's only worth $2.7k, gulp)
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:20:10
News outlets (real ones like CNBC, at least) don't engage in smear campaigns. It's delusional to think so and I sincerely hope you're joking. Who do you think brought BTC coverage to the masses?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:11:16
I received $4k of BTC and altcoins for Christmas. The portfolio is worth $2.6k now. I'm holding at least until it goes back up. Otherwise, my Christmas gift from my brother was nothing lol
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:13:25
Well, you can stop being an ass. I did read Trezor's site, as well as Ledger's. BYE!
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:43:32
I have more than just bitcoin, I need to store BCH, ETH and LTC
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:08:46
I have a Linux laptop that runs Ubuntu. Maybe I should do it from there. I don't own a printer, can I just write it down? And how do I know which website is legit? :-/
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:31:35
That's not really a helpful answer. I obviously don't know how to get the keys, which is the whole point. Also, I don't have just BTC, I have BCH, ETH and LTC.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:13:04
I wasn't on Twitter during the holidays so you'll have to forgive me for missing tweets immediately before and after Christmas...
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:28:23
Well, given that I don't understand how any of this works, it's impossible for me to be able to assess who to trust or not. So feedback from people who know more than I is useful.
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:24:51
All I see is a big ol' downward trend of me losing money.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:39:23
I love that Grace thinks Banksy is behind Bitcoin. lol
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:44:37
I still have BTC sitting in Coinbase and I want to move it because I don't trust Coinbase. But I find digital wallets very confusing and I don't know who to trust. Thought maybe I could drop them into my Square Cash app, but I guess you're telling me I cannot do that. Sigh.
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:52:16
I trust Square because it has all the security and backing of a traditional (fiat) platform but I'll have to wait to see if they add that feature. I also know some people that work there and it seems like a very legit, well-run company. (Unlike Coinbase, which seems like a shitshow.) Thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:33:24
This is so stupid. I read this and the evidence comes down "well, I personally don't see how it could've been done without plagiarism!" There is no proof it was plagiarized and, frankly... who cares? It seems like this dude is jealous a 16-year-old girl got attention and set out to attack her. It's sad, really. Nothing more than bullying and a witch hunt. Get a life and stop attacking little girls on the internet, bro.
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:43:31
You mean, I couldn't deposit one BTC and take out $8k or whatever? In other words, Square is not going to do currency exchanges between BTC and USD? Is that what you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:39:16
Yeah, the Russian government is an organized crime organization. Although with Trump in power, doubt we'll see U.S. sanctions soon, but Putin is probably thinking about what other countries will do when they catch Russia hacking into their election systems too.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:42:42
This subreddit is the worst one in my feed when it comes to 1) misleading or straight-up false headlines 2) shitty sources.
This wasn't passed into law. It cleared one vote in the Senate. Now it needs to go to the House. And then there are more steps after that if the House approves, which it probably won't.
I'm so close to unsubscribing here. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:22:39
lol ummmmmm okay bruh
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:56:19
Ok, I understand. So I cannot move my BTC from Coinbase to Square. That's fine. I assume you also can't withdraw BTC as USD, just export the BTC to an external wallet. Well, Square won't help me for BTC in this case - but I still love using it for paying people back!
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:51:25
Because it's a witch hunt and bullying? Did you even read it. There's no proof or evidence and yet it's an invitation to attack this little girl. WTF is wrong with you?
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:00:57
You don't need it. But if you wanted people to be able to give you money via credit cards, you can use that "square thing" to swipe their cards. That's a Square card reader and it's normally used by people who have a business - when I encounter them, it's usually cab drivers or food carts use them to allow people to pay with credit cards. But I've used them to pay in coffee shops and farmers markets, etc.
Square Cash, meanwhile, is just an app like Venmo (but better) that allows you to easily exchange money with people without any fees. They recently added a feature where you can buy Bitcoin with it too. If you search Square Cash in the app store, you'll find it. This thread is about Square Cash. 
The same company is behind the card reader and the app.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:33:31
Will do.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:09:14
I definitely trust a website called CryptoGuru.bid. ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:47:24
He's an obvious virgin. An "incel" if you will. I'm reporting him.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:00:44
In a nutshell: can we attribute the rise in price to anything in particular or, like all BTC movement, do we just have to wonder and speculate?
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:47:53
Just so you guys know, he is saying it warrants regulation, he's not just saying Bitcoin is awesome
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:37:38
...Cool repost. Zzzz.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:38:53
I'm sure it'll bounce back. Or not. But money isn't everything. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:40:58
I don't know if they are goofy, but they are pure conjecture. No one knows why Bitcoin does what it does.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:10:48
Use Square Cash instead to exchange money between friends. Also, Square Cash lets you buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:24:28
Sexism, which I'll bet is the driving factor behind this dumb witch hunt in the first place.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:37:28
Given that he runs the Russian government like it's an organized crime organization (and it basically is), this doesn't surprise me. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:51:03
Bet you've never gotten laid either because you're a sexist douche.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:39:04
I guess that's a good point because there is a finite amount of land you can buy.

"It's like a digital Antiques Roadshow. You're standing in line and you have no idea 'til you get there." lmao. I mean, she's kind of right. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:52:41
How is this even approved though? Did you read it? The "evidence" of plagiarism is nonexistent. It's basically an attempt to bully a little girl on the internet.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:49:39
Or you could've read the post and saw there's no evidence o plagiarism at all, you misogynist asshole.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:42:03
Every single one of your comments here is so misogynist. I guarantee you have never been laid and you live with your parents.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:57:17
Are *you* joking? If she worked with other people on the app and they agreed to do work for her, it's not plagiarism. And the "evidence" that she didn't do anything doesn't exist. Again, why do you care? It's so embarrassing and sad. Take a moment and look at your life.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:16:27
If she had collaborators who agreed it was her app to take credit for and take ownership of (which is what happened), then it's not dishonest and this outage is incredibly dumb. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:41:50
Don't forget it's .bid, not even .com. lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:05:40
Dude, I really am not interested in having this dumb argument than you. The "rep" she got was a thread on reddit. If that makes you so jealous, I suggest maybe you take a break from reddit and leave your house. This is a very dumb thing to be mad about. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:55:07

Bitcoin more and more is feelings like some sort of scam. The more sketchy advertisements I see for buying the Bitcoin, the more I become convinced that it's for dumb people.
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:14:47

Yes, the fiat lobby is paying an army of bots to go on reddit and talk about paper money. It's the massive conspiracy that the New World Order and the Illuminati don''t want you to know about!!!!!11
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:40:37
Everything you said about paper money applies to Bitcoin. It's just lines of code.
