I wanted to do a 50%/50% split between Bitcoin and my personal bank account but in order to link your bank account with Bitwage, it says you have to subscribe to Bitwage.me which is $9.99/month. Is that what you did to split it?
@_date: 2016-08-26 03:43:15
Do you have to actually buy something in order to withdraw the $10?
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:30:21
I refuse to give up my seat on this roller coaster! 
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:52:00
Me and Jonathan from Bitwage have been exchanging emails trying to get this situation sorted out. Waiting on him to reply to my last email. Ill keep this thread updated.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:07:54
This needs to be turned into a movie lol
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:44:38
its the perfect price in my opinion. if you are someone who uses a trezor, you are probably not storing pocket change. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:50:50


I felt this way too. Which is why i started getting worried after i sent them my information, and i didn't hear from them. 
How has your experience with it been so far? Whenever you get paid, does it show you what Bitcoin rate you were paid at?

Can you clarify what you mean "sweep the keys with my seed"?
I want to move all my Bitcoin to another wallet but i cant even do that because my Electrum client is linked with my Trezor, so i cant sign off on any transactions. FML
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:21:58
I dont understand why this is happening and how it is slipping through the seams and making its way into the app stores? Can anyone chime in and explain??
@_date: 2016-08-19 06:43:40
Oh yeah i understand that. Its just that multiple outlets are not reading Trezor devices. Even other redditors have claimed they have had the same problems. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:14:49
Can someone explain what this means? IL5 ..
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:04:43
Where are you making that assumption from?
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:26:37
So selling Bitcoin is not really anonymous because you need to link a bank account. But what about buying? I assume you would also need to link a bank account as well to buy?
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:04:32
Great read
@_date: 2016-03-07 05:45:01
Anyone know when it will be actually ready and out of testmode?

Can someone ELI5?
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:16:12
This website is legit. The founders name is Ben Baller, he makes custom jewelry for a lot of celebrities and has made chains for Kanye West and other big name artists
@_date: 2016-11-13 23:31:12
Holy. What is that from? Thats Breaking Bad IRL 
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:44:49
It's becoming more and more clear of the benefits of SegWit...its unfortunate *some* are opposed to it due to political agendas.
@_date: 2016-11-18 04:47:34

@_date: 2016-12-20 15:33:14
Where can i buy that?

Just finished watching the episode, very interesting. Didn't even know they had more seasons past season 1, thanks
@_date: 2016-11-19 14:48:14
i need this framed
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:52:38
This is gentleman!11!!
@_date: 2016-11-09 19:57:15
It didn't "soar". If you think that is the Bitcoin price soaring, you must be relatively new here
@_date: 2016-11-10 00:41:14
you mean to tell me someone lied about sending hundreds of people free money?
@_date: 2016-11-05 03:24:37
you're quite the pessimist aren't you
@_date: 2016-11-10 00:46:44
You guys need to make it more clear in the FAQ about the 3 month fee. Im on mobile so i dont feel like searching through your website, but i believe that you guys charge fees for users who dont use their cards for 3 months or something along those lines.
That alone drove me away.
@_date: 2016-11-05 03:20:23
Point 4 is very important and overlooked imo.
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:03:11
saved in my memebank ty bby
@_date: 2016-11-03 01:35:27
no fee?? what are the limits? can someone confirm?
sorry on mobile right now
@_date: 2016-11-20 18:00:56
Very nice
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:27:45
They're new here probably..we can let it slide
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:27:19
@_date: 2016-11-17 00:19:38
seems about right
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:18:21
What forms of ID or verifications are used in using Bitwala? 
@_date: 2016-02-05 00:45:51
What about breadwallet? how anonymous is that?
@_date: 2016-02-14 06:04:45
Uh except this never happened. First and foremost, Kanye would never do this.
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:37:29
Does that mean there is a limit to how much you can put on your card without verification? What about spending your card at a store or restaurant, is there also a limit without verification?
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:14:11
Anyone else have a problem with trying to use it? I click on the button next to iMessage message box and it just brings up the Circle logo. Is there something im supposed to do in settings?
@_date: 2016-09-07 18:11:58
Not true. You can send USD straight from your linked bank account to another person via email, their bitcoin address or phone number. You don't need to buy Bitcoin first
@_date: 2016-09-01 16:03:45
It works. But there were many issues that could have been avoided. After my experience, i am no longer using Bitwage. Id rather just use Circle.

why are transaction fees high right now? for me it was like 0.16-0.20 cents.
@_date: 2016-09-29 03:27:10
Do you prefer ledger nano over trezor?
@_date: 2016-09-01 20:08:33
It didn't go "badly" per-say. But for me at least, the process was cumbersome and found the whole process a headache. This is in no way of bashing them. I salute Bitwage for what they do - and they deliver well. But at this stage in my life currently, i found that it was unnecessary and also did not enjoy the fact that it takes an extra day or two to process your money and actually have the Bitcoin sent to you
edit: fwiw, i can see myself trying them again in the future
@_date: 2016-09-03 04:54:43
That is a very interesting concept.
@_date: 2016-09-17 04:54:20
If you value security i think its a practical investment.
@_date: 2016-10-29 03:41:04
Feels good man. This is only the beginning!
@_date: 2016-10-24 03:34:43
When does it come out? Where is it being released?
@_date: 2016-10-27 02:10:37
Is it as simple as just say buy like a certain amount of dollars every week or month?
@_date: 2016-10-27 02:05:32
Was thinking the same? A lot can happen from Q1 to Q4
@_date: 2016-10-30 03:32:25
Where was the pizza from?
@_date: 2016-10-05 05:17:25
Does it still not work with Trezor? Im holding off on updating right now
@_date: 2016-10-30 03:41:55
People tend to think too short-term but don't really grasp the thought of thinking about what it would be worth in 10-20 years
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:36:58
Is there a service for the other way around?
@_date: 2016-10-02 00:56:07
Heres a counter question regarding OP:
Where can one sell a laptop for Bitcoin? Other than OpenBazaar (its pretty a flop as of right now imo).
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:53:46
For USD/BTC how does that work? Since its P2P, does say for example, buying/selling Bitcoin transfer fiat via money wires?
@_date: 2016-10-30 03:43:14
&amp; with more nodes, doesn't this ultimately mean a stronger and faster network, making it more stable?
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:53:13
I have a feeling the reason its been pushed back is because of the recent upgrade with Bitcoin. I believe it was suppose to start sometime in October, but still waiting
@_date: 2016-10-30 03:51:11
Just think...only 21 million Bitcoin to EVER be created, and while taking into account all the lost coin we don't even know about..man..
im excited for the future. i just hope i can retire early
