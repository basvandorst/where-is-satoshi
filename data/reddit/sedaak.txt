You don't characterize point 4 and you are making no connection from 4 to 5 and 6.
It is difficult for me to accept 5 and 6 when the average birth rate in Nigeria is 7 (vs 1.3 in Japan).  If people in these countries cannot afford basic necessities, and they choose to have large quantities of children, larger than the 1st world could ever hope to sustain, who should bear the burden?
 US is only (.33B/7.6B=) 4 PERCENT of the world's population.  How could only 4 percent have such an almost genocidal effect as you claim???
You are claiming that the productivity, or lack of it, of 4 percent of the world is causing starvation by people that are unable to escape poverty.

I don't have any respect for wedded couples who couldn't take the time to establish their own nuptial agreement; why should their lack of understanding saddle others?


Society has standards.  Most people live to such standards without a criminal justice system.  The law you are insinuating is civil, contract law, which is nothing more than keeping promises, and systems to encourage the keeping of promises.  That works fine.  You are doing a lot of hand waving saying that some things could not possibly exist.  I have never had any positive interaction with a government agency, and nothing particularly negative.  The majority of the roads I drive on were not built with public funds. I just see the economic effects of excessive taxation and vast increases in the money supply.  If you are theorizing that society is peaceful because those things exist, then it really is just a theory.  The US was relatively peaceful for hundreds of years before the establishment of most current taxes in the 1900s.

Their ability to reduce the amount owed to you.  So you'd have to also be registered as a creditor, have submitted proof, and show cause that this would cause you enough hardship that you should be considered before everyone else.
You could also claim that they have hidden assets, and object to the bankruptcy itself.  There may be other ways to object to a bankruptcy, however Mt. Gox is so far in the hole as far as we know that there is  no such case.

In no world should it be difficult to get the child from the father.  In either way, a nuptial agreement would sort such things out.  It doesn't matter if violence is involved, the father and mother have to make those decisions and stick with them.

During a bankruptcy, creditors are prioritized, and then funds are distributed giving the creditors an equal(per priority group) share of the remaining assets.  Considering we heard news of some cache of 200,000 btc, there does exist funds to be distributed.  How the court will choose to treat bitcoin remains to be seen.
There is very limited time to object to the bankruptcy itself, or for your prioritization as a creditor. I am not a lawyer, but I can pretty much guarantee that every standard account holder has an equal priority.  I don't know anything about what other kinds of debt Mt. Gox may have had that could be prioritized over us.
Personally, it feels good that records exist of the funds I held at Gox and that the courts were automatically provided with the identifying information needed.  I'm still researching if any additional registration will be needed with the bankruptcy court(s).

What exactly is a vigilante?
I would defend my car by saying, "Leave my car alone, "  and tracking it if you do take it, and taking it back, filing suit against you for any damages.  If you attack me I will defend myself.  And similarly I would help my friends do the same.
Which is exactly what I do.  If you believe that there is another institution that is willing to track down and regain a stolen vehicle you are pretty much mistaken.

The consequence of that statement is violent enforcement.  Say there is an small town with 30 people, would they decide that 16 of them can force the remaining to do whatever they want?  That is exactly what happens in Democracy.  Stating that individuals cannot be permitted to any kind of social contract is the definition of bondage.
What if it is one large family of 16 people, and a few small families?
Increasing the population size exacerbates the issue, rather than somehow smoothing it out.


I assume the right to defend it, and based on my contracts with other people, other people would assist me in doing so or leave me alone to do so.

I don't support private citizen's forcibly punishing others at a whim.  I support them protecting their property.  Self-defense does not make a vigilante. Neighborhood watch, security cameras, device tracking like ipads, all do not make vigilantes.  Taking back your own property does not make a vigilante.
The rate at which cops shoot innocent people is last I checked 8 times higher than civilians. The rate at which concealed carry holders commit crimes is some absurdly low number compared to the rest of society.  The vast majority of gun crime is gang related.  Your cited anecdotal evidence carries no weight.
If you take away guns, then I win, because I'm strong.  The other physically strong people win too.  If you are insinuating that I couldn't kill someone as fast with other weapons then I would laugh.  On top of that guns are extremely easy to make, so they are impossible to outlaw (yes the bullets too).  After all, they were invented hundreds of years ago.  Guns are still not the issue we are discussing, we are discussing the monopoly on force.  Guns are a symbol of power, and a symbol of whether it is distributed or concentrated in a few.

What would be illegal about it if you had a prescription?  It doesn't matter where you buy it from.

Someone else had mentioned Austria above. In either case, the person making the claim should be substantiating it.  Taxes in US are quite low relatively for average earners.
But wow, New Zealand has a GST of 15%?? That's really high.
Since so much is made outside of New Zealand, then there are likely import taxes on top of commonly purchased goods.

Wasn't it?  They said it was the same inhaler, including brand.
@_date: 2015-07-15 07:34:23
If you have a prescription it isn't technically a crime to get it whereever you feel like it.  If she has a doctor, which she presumably does given the other inhalers, then the prescription wasn't a showstopper at all.  The story has more punch if he says he has to commit a crime.
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:22:12
Which of those is a crime for the purchaser?  I'm pretty sure that none of them is a crime.  Having a prescription allows purchase and possession.

I challenge that MineForeman's full cycle taxes (sales, property, income, import) are less than an average americans as a percentage of income.
From Wikipedia: In Austria, the income tax for individuals in 2005 was progressively set up to 50% on a four-bracket progressive schedule: 21% (on taxable income from €3,640 to €7,270; 31% (€7,270 to €21,800); 41% (€21,800 to 50,870); and 50% above €51,000. Married people are taxed separately. Payroll withholding tax is in effect.
This alone is MASSIVELY higher than in the US.

He is saying that calling that group ISIS would be the same as that.  It doesn't necessarily mean anything, and could even be SEO cover or something else bizarre.

ISIS is the acronym for the english translation of the Arabic name.  It has nothing to do with what they named themselves.  That is why it is interchangeably called IS, ISIS, ISIL, JTJ, Al Qaeda in Iraq, and others.

?  Utilities companies are paid directly, I'm not understanding the relation or why that would be coddling.
Here the costs are built in, in a way that hides them from the consumer, and allows consumers to be globally tracked.  The alternative, which exposes the costs and allows anonymity, brings a greater responsibility to the populace.  The term coddled even is relative.  Maybe you want to be coddled.
