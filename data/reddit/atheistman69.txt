Easy, unlike Capitalism, you won't be confined to jobs that are profitable. You will have the freedom to choose what you wish to pursue, free of charge.

Labour value is stolen as well. Both are theft, long live the anti-capitalist movement.

Capitalism will profit from anything. The capitalist will sell us the rope which he hangs from.

We've been robbed since the beginning of history comrade. The banks being corrupt is only one of the modern incarnations of workers being screwed over.

2018: let's use bitcoin to buy guns and seize them fucking means of production.

The central banks and governments are the enemy of the proletariat.

You know mises is a joke, which is why you respond with a shot at my username instead of a credible argument.

I fail to see how that's relevant. The west destablized the middle east, they're seeing the consequences.

Capitalism being destabilized? Where do I sign up? Maybe fellow communists should look into bitcoin.

Socialists believe in worker ownership of the means of production. This allows people to not be taxed, thus decreasing money for war.

Modern society is a cancer which is on a fast track to destroying itself, at the center of the destruction is Capitalism. Anything that destabilizes modern governments and economies is a step in the right direction. Kill global Capitalism before it kills you.
