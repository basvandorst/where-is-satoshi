If all you really wanna know is investment and you would only read one book then I'd choose "the intelligent investor: the definitive book on value investing" by Benjamin Graham.  
Not sure where you are in life either but if I had to choose a book that helped me with money then it was "I will teach you to be rich" by ramit sethi

Read a book. Investing all your money in bitcoins or anything for that matter is super risky.   
You can get hacked, someone could make a new currency better tomorrow that would destroy all current cryptocurrencies, never put all your eggs in a basket

I'm not if I consider it to be a wrong thing. Like asking the government to force my landlord to do business with me on my terms.    
I don't know why people want to stay in big cities if they aren't working in tourism or have a high paying job anyways.

Do you think you have the right of going to a tech city and demand that tech companies are banned because you work in retail and the tech companies workers are increasing the demand for houses thus driving the rent higher?   
The next point is irrelevant but the people that complain about airbnb should take the chance to get involved in tourism and fulfill the demand instead of fighting the market and trying to come up with supply.

This is why democracy even in an ideal world is shit. Why do you think you have the right to say if people can or can't use airbnb?

No you can't. If you sell 10% of the gold reserves it will shaken the gold price a lot.  
The only difference between gold and bitcoins in this aspect is the capitalization value.
