sha256 generates 256 bits, and (almost) any 256 bits are a valid private key.  
There are formats such as WIF which include a checksum and format it in a way that make it more human readable, but those are just ways of communicating the 256 bits.
You are correct in your thinking:  If you randomly generated a WIF sequence, you would fail to produce a valid private key almost every time, due to the checksum.  
But the way this works is that people produce the 256 bits with sha256, and then FORMAT those 256 bits in WIF format (or other formats).

The sign guy got about $2K, before he announced that everything else donated would go to charity.  So from then on, any donation was a contribution to charity with a marketing message attached, which could help benefit Bitcoin holders.
Ross's contributions reached $600 in one account, but as others have said, there are multiple ways of donating to him, and so this isn't the total.  Not to mention that many people feel that a donation to Ross's legal case doesn't benefit Bitcoin holders, and some question whether it's a good cause.

As I recall, Namecoin came out in April of 2011, but merged mining wasn't enabled until about October.  It required a minor tweak to the core algorithm of Namecoin, but it came out much stronger afterwards, with a much stronger hash power.
That is essentially the model for side chains.  For tree chains, a more fundamental change in the alt's algorithm would be required, but it's not unfathomable that the major stakeholders of the alt would support such a change.  It would make their coin stronger.  The more I think about this, the more I think that some lesser-known coins will jump on the idea, and get a boost because their hash power will jump tremendously, making them more valuable - thereby putting pressure on the bigger alts to make the switch.
Sort of like the merchant acceptance of Bitcoin.  Alpaca Socks takes it before Overstock, before Amazon.   But pressure to conform to compete will come from the bottom.

You're wrong on this point.  And in fact, the 65 page motion to dismiss even mentions this (did you read it?  Do you know much about the US legal system?).  The prosecution had their chance to list their charges.  There's no swapping it out later.
Now, they CAN negotiate a plea bargain (which the defendant has the right to reject or accept), which might be what you are thinking of (murder to manslaughter).  But they cannot swap out the charges later.
If, after failing to convict at trial, they want to come up with some new charges, and go through the process again, it's highly unlikely to succeed, thanks to double jeopardy laws.
@_date: 2014-04-30 11:00:28
For the bazillionth time, the murder-for-hire charges were not dropped.  They were never in the original charges.  See [here]( and read the lines that say "COUNT ONE" through "COUNT THREE".

The murder-for-hire is a separate case in Maryland, which (to the best of my knowledge) has not been dropped.

If you deal with potential thieves a lot, then you would want to add a layer of protection in the mix, which adds a cost.   Bitcoin has separated the protection services, so that if you don't need them, you don't have to pay for them.  But those services are certainly available (escrow).
If I am buying from Overstock, neither they nor I need to pay the extra cost for that protection;  their reputation is good, and their customer service has fixed issues in the past for me.  And, by not adding in that extra level of protection, and costs associated with it, we get a cheaper payment system, and then hopefully cheaper products for me!

I can't speak for OP, but I think that the usual objection to the term "Market Cap" has to do with the fact that you capitalize a company, but you don't capitalize a currency.
But you are right:  market capitalization has little to do with the actual capitalization figure.  It's what the market values the whole company at, if you use the latest exchange price, and that is similar to how the term is used relative to Bitcoin.

There are plenty of charities to donate to.  Why would I donate to a specific charity, unless it's something I believe in?  
The reason some people find this charity worth donating to is because they accept crypto.  They know it's a business decision to accept crypto, and you and others may be supporting them purely because of that decision - and may not have heard of them otherwise.
The charity is making a conscious decision to accept crypto currencies, with some expected consequences.  There may be unexpected consequences as well, based on that.  You can down-vote me if you want, but they need to realize that it's a choice they made, a business decision, with consequences.  I'm ok with their decision; I just choose to support the charities that make a different business decision.  There are plenty of them.  And I should not be denied that right.
One criticism of Bitcoin is that the "fixed supply" is BS because clone after clone can be created.  This is a true problem if clone after clone has the buying power and network effect of bitcoin.  I choose not to support that.  
I hope you aren't telling me that I do **not** have the freedom to support charities who make business decisions consistent with my beliefs.

Yeah, it's fun for a while, but every ten days when your return rate gets cut by 20%, it gets a little depressing.  $1600 could have bought you what... 3 BTC?  Let's see if you ever get close to that.
You essentially bought BTC on a bad payment plan:  You pay $1600, and you get .6 or .75 BTC total, trickled in (I am basing this estimate on my results, which were 2x the first month's returns, total.)
You would have been better off buying the 3 BTC, and running cgminer on your PC to see what it was like, as a hobby.

Once you assign colors to the sides, no variations are rotations of others.  You can't rotate the cube without changing the color of the middle pieces for a given side.
Did you look at the code?  If you examine the code, you may understand what I am saying.
I agree, though, mere rotations reduce the space of possible rubik positions.  But then if you take a position, and assign a color to each, you have locked that position in place (for purposes of his SHA function).  And if you assigned a number to each color, or a word, or a hex digit, you could further add to the entropy.  He assigns a color.  That adds entropy.

I didn't quite agree with your wishing-well analogy in segment 1.   Maybe I am misunderstanding it.
You seem to imply that the penny dispenser solves the chicken-or-egg problem.   I really think that a penny dispenser merely creates penny hoarders.  A lot of people will rush to scoop up pennies, but still not contribute to the system... hoping that others will make their pennies more valuable.  As an early adopter, you actually have a **dis**incentive to get others into the system early on, so you can scoop up more pennies with less competition.
I saw a recent experiment with another labor-mined alt coin earlier this year.  There were many more hoarders than contributors, and I think it died on the vine.
The only reason that ~~LGBTCoin~~ **LTBCoin** (sorry, Freudian typo) might take off is because you have already solved the chicken or egg problem.  You have something of value (content, history, and a good following).  If you were starting from scratch, then a coin creating something out of nothing is really unprecedented and unproven, I think.

Put 90% of them in cold storage (that is, take them off of the internet.... read up on it).  Don't even consider selling for two years.  Maybe 5.  This is a long-term investment.
Then take the other 10% and try spending them.  Go to Overstock.com and buy something that you were going to buy anyway.  Move the coins around.  See how they work.  
Once you have spent them, replace them (maybe with 11%), and try again.  Many people really *get it* once they have bought something without having to divulge a bunch of private "Identity-vulnerable" information (like your credit card and CCV/CVC number).

In the case of Bitcoin, the only way to collect "pennies" (using the wishing well analogy) was to provide the accounting service (mining). 
I think that's the trick.  You can't just put a penny dispenser up.  You need to require that the person do something to get the penny, that creates value for your service.  
In the case of Bitcoin, the bar was low.  Run this program, contribute CPU, and you'll be rewarded.  In the case of the wishing well, maybe the person needs to be conspicuous in his visit.  Skip on your way to the well, wave your arms, tell five people.  Maybe loiter and small-talk at the wishing well.  Do something of value that attracts other people.

I am not sure why you feel there's a conspiracy or that you deserve any "public acknowledgement".  
The bitcoin community in 2010 was very small.  Many of these guys knew each other.  Some of us talked to each one of them in chat.  It would not be unusual for deals to be struck, or people to pitch in on a project.
So a domain name was in Mutum Sigillum's name.  How does that hurt you, or contribute to some major conspiracy?
A far more likely scenario was that Mutum Sigillum LLC had the ability to get a domain name quick for a friend.

I'm not sure what will be the best plan for Mt. Gox, and I don't have a stake in it.  But I think you underestimate the value of the brand.
They do own the trademark for the word "Bitcoin", and have been **the** major bitcoin exchange for years, and could have hundreds of thousands of users with a vested interest in seeing them succeed.
You call it a toxic brand, and my analogy has always been Tylenol, which was **literally** a toxic brand, [killing people]( who are trying to rid themselves of a headache.  Yet it's one of the most trusted brands 32 years later.  Heck, it was one of the most trusted brands 3 years later.
So don't underestimate people's willingness to forgive, especially if a credible plan is put forward.  
Personally, I wouldn't mind if Mt. Gox went away - I'd actually prefer it.  But my bet is that someone will come in and resurrect it, and in five years (or less), it will be an extremely trusted brand.

Seriously, if you watched past cycles, whether you believe in past performance predicting future results or not, you shouldn't be surprised at this point.

They still can, and likely will, in my opinion.  They can use those charges as leverage in plea bargaining, and as followup charges in the event that Ulbricht gets off in New York.  Or they will have a stronger case, once (if) he is found guilty of being DPR in the New York Case.
If the Maryland case waits for the New York case to be adjudicated, then they can skip whole sections of the prosecution, which would require them proving that Ulbricht = DPR.

Sounds so scammy, spammy.  Toss meaningless tips around.  Am I missing something?  Is this a bug?  Or are people just that rude that they would toss fake tips around?
Do you have a tracking of how many Dogetips are unfunded?  (I'm sure you can't track how many are malformed, as those wouldn't be seen by the bot.)
And... just to be clear, this isn't just a dogetipbot issue, it seems there are at least about ten of these bots floating around, where a message gets posted about a tip, but there's never a private message confirming it.

Basically it would lock Satoshi out of all his coins from 2009.

Wow. You found my statement disheartening and cold.  Why are you hating on ME - by accusing me of hate.  All I said is I prefer to support Bitcoin-only charities.
I though crypto was about choice in currency.  Are you saying that **I do NOT have the freedom** to support the currency of my choice?
There are plenty of ways to be charitable.  I want to support the Bitcoin environment (or I would just donate dollars).
Alts have their place.  And people have the right to buy them.  And charities are making a statement by accepting crypto currencies.  They are choosing what they want to support, and I am choosing what I want to support.  There's no hate there at all, except in your eyes and words. 
I personally believe that alts represent crypto-inflation.  Am I not entitled to that belief?  There's only a limited amount of money invested in crypto currency, and every increase in value of an alt is less for bitcoin.
Charities and companies need to understand that the currency they accept is a choice.  And by accepting alts, they may gain some donors, while losing others.   They have that right, just as I have a right to vote with my wallet.

I hate to disagree with Mrs. Ulbricht, since she is clearly closer to the case, but Ross was charged in two separate jurisdictions.  The murder-for-hire charge was in the Maryland District, and the formal arraignment that she mentioned was in New York.
So, the fact that he wasn't formally charged in the arraignment in New York for murder-for-hire in a case that he wasn't indicted for murder-for-hire isn't really significant.  Although the New York indictment mentioned murder-for-hire, it wasn't one of the charges.  He still has those charges hanging over his head in the second case.

Preventing double spending is a huge accomplishment for Satoshi, in a Peer-to-Peer network.   
It works like this:   If conflicting transactions are released to two different peers in the P2P network, each computer will only forward on the FIRST transaction that they hear.
So one transaction will *likely* reach more nodes than the other.  But either way... each miner will only be trying to close the books with one transaction or the other.  And the one that gets included is the one that the **winning miner** heard about first.  So the person who closes the books decides.  (and that's based on the luck of solving the block.)
Chances are, the miner that solves the block will include the transaction that is more widely known, which, chances are, will be the transaction that hit the network first.
But in cases where there's an evil miner, it gets trickier.  The miner can buy a cup of coffee, and then mine a conflicting transaction, making the coffee transaction be the invalid transaction.   That's why you should always wait for at least one confirmation.

The "four" horsemen were IBM and the "BUNCH":  Burroughs, Univac (ultimately Sperry, then Unisys with Burroughs), NCR (later bought by AT&amp;T), Cray, and Honeywell.  None of them jumped on the fledgling upstart project called the PC.
When the Internet began gaining traction, the incumbent networks were Compuserve, AOL, and Prodigy.  In all cases, it made sense to defend their own turf, rather than support the very industry that would destroy their incumbency.
If all incumbents stay put, then the upstart's success can be delayed, put into question, and possibly thwarted.  Game theory leads to the decision of betting on proprietary networks or systems, and ignoring the little start-up, because there's plenty of money to be made here and now, and you can always buy into a position later.
So...  forget about the four horsemen.  It's going to be Overstock for a while, plus other gutsy heroes.  The Overstocks and Tiger Directs will give a wakeup call to the New Eggs.  But the top tier can wait three to five years without missing a beat.

Peter, I have a few questions:
How do you see Bitcoin progressing in the implementation of either (or both) tree chains and/or side chains?   Do you think there will be a BIP for each, and a discussion and a decision to implement one?
Do you think both will get implemented, and they'll duke it out in the field of public opinion?
Also, it seems to me that current alt-coin holders would prefer one or the other?  Is this true?  Which?  I'm not asking for financial advice, but does either jeopardize the viability of alt-coins?  Is there a path for alt-coin holders to move to tree chains or side chains (such that the owner doesn't lose his current holdings, and the value of the alt coin might actually survive the switch)?
It seems like if this affects the viability of certain alt coins, then the owners will actively resist, unless there's a clear migration path.

No it would not be like that.
With XOR, you can go from any state to any other state in one move.  With rubik's cube you can go from any state to any other state in 20 deliberate moves.  But 20 random moves won't give you equal odds to get to every possible state.  There will be a probability curve, with states that are possible to get to via multiple mechanisms having a much higher probability than states that can only be arrived at via 20 specific moves.
A better analogy for XOR might be an XOR function that can flip any 13 bits (out of 260 bits, to make it round numbers).  In other words, you can XOR with any number you choose, as long as it has 13 1's and the rest 0's.   With such a scheme, you could transform from any one 260-bit state to any other 260-bit state in 20 executions of the function (choosing different XOR values each time).
But transforming from one 260-bit number to its inverse, while it can be done in exactly 20 executions, is EXTREMELY unlikely to happen randomly (in bitcoin terms, practically impossible ever in the history or future of this universe).  Meanwhile, after 20 XORs, there will be a high probability that the result has many common digits as the source, and the number of common digits between the source and result will be predictable.
That's why more executions adds more entropy.  Whether 39 is a good number or not - I have no idea.  But 39 is absolutely better than 20, entropy-wise.

I have a right to privacy.  You are claiming that exerting my right to privacy can be a crime, which can be retroactively determined based on someone's interpretation of what I am being private about.
It's analogous to making locking the bathroom door a crime if you are committing a crime in the bathroom.  With your bas-ackwards logic, locking the bathroom door is somehow costing society more (having to find the criminal, break down the door), and therefore locking bathroom doors in the commission of a crime should be a crime.
I am not buying it.  Sorry.  While I don't believe crimes should be committed, I think we as a society need to be smart about what is and what isn't a crime.  Seeking privacy is a fundamental right, and any infringement on that should be seriously fought. 
Once you start making locking bathroom doors illegal, you start getting juries saying "You must have been hiding something."  They already say that.  Very dangerous to make non-crimes into pile-on crimes.

I'd expect that the best plan will be selected, as measured by fairness to creditors and likelihood of overall success (and credibility).
I see no issue in a) putting together a plan without initially consulting creditors (seems a little premature to consult creditors before your plan is pretty well solidified), b) proposing a "maximize profit" plan if no other plans are on the table.
I assume high-profit plans will cause other plans to come forward.  Someone has to speak first.

**Bitcoin decouples the consumer protection from the payment system.**  With Paypal, Credit cards, etc., you get it automatically (and there's a cost to that).   But if I am buying something from a major merchant online (Overstock, for example), I don't feel I need to pay a premium for consumer protection.  They have already lived up to their reputation with a simple return.  
Likewise, if I am paying money to a relative, I don't need to pay the premium for the right to cancel that transaction.

No, not every block in every blockchain.  Only the blockchain that applies to the inputs trying to be spent.  (Blockchains can easily be segregated to only include a subset of the addresses, and only the "recent" blocks of that blockchain needs to be verified.
And in fact, periodic indexes can be published in the blocks that tell which inputs are still available, meaning that not even every block needs to be checked (since the address appeared as an output) - only the index block and the blocks since the index block.
Anyone who thinks that the blockchain size issue can't be solved either hasn't given it much thought, isn't very creative, or hasn't read the material on the subject.  There are plenty of options.

I think it's relatively trivial for the IRS to run a report that estimates bitcoin total sales for each taxpayer, given the data, and then ensures that the taxpayer reported that dollar amount of bitcoin sales on their return, and then cranks out letters to those who apparently didn't.  This would be a "by mail audit" (I have received 3 or 4 of these in my life).  The taxpayer responds with their justification, or pays a higher tax amount.
Now, there are some assumptions in the above...  Does the IRS care?  Does the IRS have the data (down to the taxpayer id)?  Personally, I think they won't do it.  But I bet they have the Mt. Gox data, plus data from Coinbase and CampBX and other in-US exchanges. But really, with the data, this is something that they can turn over to an intern to crank out the data and the letters.  The collection machine is already in place.  It's the "unreported revenue" program that would need to be written, and this stuff happens all the time.  Worst case, they send audit letters to a bunch of people demanding more revenue, and the people write back and say they're wrong.  Little cost to the IRS - mostly upside.
But honestly, unreported Bitcoin gains represent tiny potential IRS gains in the grand scheme.  How much tax revenue will they be able to recover by doing this?  A million?  I can't imagine more than 10 million.
As I said, I have received several of these letters in the past.  I am fairly aggressive on my taxes (I certainly don't feel an obligation to pay more than the required amount), but I am also pretty good at retaining records.  One time, I was wrong, and had forgot to include some income.  The other times, I simply wrote back with my evidence, saying "this is how I did the calculations, and here are some of my records backing it up."  And I "won" the audit in all other cases.

If you are buying something, a better rate might be the ACTUAL market price, in dollars, for the goods or services that you are buying.   In this case, Andy doesn't give the dollar price.  But most vendors compute it all in dollars, and the last step is to convert to Bitcoin, so you already have the "market value" right in front of you; no need to use bitcoinaverage.
An aggressive tax payer would probably use whichever rate is more favorable, tax-wise, either the bitcoinaverage conversion price or the price used by the vendor (which should be approximately the same).

I like to compare the bitcoin code to the US Constitution document.   The authors didn't have to say "trust us, we'll rule you better than King George rules you".

You don't have to trust me to be a more generous ruler than the last guy - read it for yourself.  Trust the 'system', that takes the power out of the hands of individuals".

Your post is nearly the opposite of the guy who says "Bitcoin isn't fair because the early adopters got rich without having to do anything."
in 2010, it was *hard* to obtain and retain bitcoin.  I remember students firing up miners on all the computers in the school computer lab, trying to get some.  I remember some people cashing out their thousand bitcoins for a grand, laughing all the way to the bank.  I remember reports of thefts of tens of thousands of Bitcoins due to security issues.  I remember having to write a check to a stranger in Virginia to buy Bitcoins.
Early adopters got rewarded for having to put up with a lot of BS to obtain and retain.  The BS is easier, but it still will get even easier (I think), which means that there's still room for growth, because most average people aren't going to try to figure it out.

Side chains could easily implement small transaction fees in the side chain that paid the inventor or early investors, or fund additional development.  Some alt coins do this.
This way the users of the side chain incur the cost (with each transaction).  Effectively in bitcoins.
A fair market value would evolve - if someone invents Side1 coin with some real interesting contribution, but a high transactional load, then someone else might clone it with a smaller load.  The market will decide what's fair contribution.
I'd expect that money would flow to and from a particular sidechain rarely (only to bring the side chain demand in line with supply).  There would probably be a markets for side chain currency, which would be pretty much in line with Bitcoins ("want a sidecoin?  you have two choices - convert a bitcoin to sidecoin which has a small lag, or immediately buy a sidecoin with bitcoin."

I am not OP, but I'll tell you my interpretation.
You can't be prosecuted about THINKING about murder.  The crime is murder.  If you do it, you get charged.
If you rob a bank, that's a crime.  Laundering money is something that is often associated with robbing a bank (and so is driving away from a bank), but the crime is robbing a bank.  Yet they will charge you with money laundering.  Yet spending privately should be a right of every law abiding citizen.
They tack on an extra crime, which should be a fundamental right.  And then if you perform money laundering as a law-abiding citizen (for privacy), people assume you must be committing a crime, and therefore you are guilty until proven innocent.  In fact, money laundering has been used as evidence of committing a crime, even though it should be your right.
The crime is elsewhere.  Not in money laundering. Not in thinking about a crime.  And certainly not in driving away from a bank.

Actually, 51% attacks can be almost assuredly successful at 50.0001% (Not "over 51%") and probabilistically successful at lesser percentages.  For example, at 49%, you have a very good probability of being able to double-spend.
But while this is a concern, it's not necessarily as big of a problem (41%) as OP makes it out to be.  In the last 24 hours, Ghash has solved 42% of the blocks, but in the last 4 days, it's 33%.

My quick answer would be that Bitcoin isn't about zero government oversight.   In fact, although there are some real government haters in the bitcoin crowd, I'd venture to say that most people expect there to be the rule of law around bitcoin - thieves will be pursued and charged, etc.
The reason I am gung-ho about Bitcoin is that it provides frictionless payments and programmable money.  For the first time in history, you can send value *directly* to nearly anyone on the planet, nearly instantly, nearly free.  The technology behind it is amazing and unprecedented, and opens the doors for a bunch of additional technologies (much like the internet did).
The other cool thing is that the distribution mechanism limits government's ability to tax you via inflation.  Right now, Bitcoin is in a high period of inflation (about 10% annual inflation), but this plummets in the coming years.  And no politician or bankers (like the Fed) can negotiate behind closed doors to take value out of my pocket by printing more money.

Overstock accepted Bitcoin and expects to make a profit.  Maybe more than a house's worth!
Should we beat up anyone who wants to be rewarded for their efforts?
I think of your adventure as similar to the red paperclip guy, years ago, or the million dollar web page (which spawned tons of copycats).   Many people were jealous or envious of both.  But neither was free of effort or inspiration.  So I wish you luck.  I wish I would have thought of it.

they also made a cool video with an inaccurate mining graph..  And they had a nice graphical sticker on their office door.  That should count for something.
Personally, I believe that he got in over his head a little, but not fraudulently (at least not intentionally).   I just can't believe people would run scams as public figures, when it's so easy to do it in the Bitcoin crowd as anonymous figures.  People around here are very trusting of anonymous figures (like BTC-E, not saying that they are fraudsters, just giving an example).

It's still very possible to do it right, and make it memorable.
Here's one way.  Recall three or four events in your life that are memorable...  (four examples... choose these, or use your own)... event 1 is the most significant encounter you had with a bully in school before your teen years.   event 2 is your most embarrassing moment during your teens.   event 3 is your biggest accomplishment during your post teen (roughly college age) years, where you were so proud of pulling something off.  event 4 might be your nearest-death experience.
For each event, 4 questions:  Who, What (object), What (action), and Where?
For the "Who?" question, the answer is the full name of the most significant other person involved, or (if none) who heard about this event first.  The "what object" is the most significant object involved.  "What action" is a verb (in the form of "to ______".... so if your most embarrassing moment was farting, you use the word "fart").  The "where" is a location.
Now, string those 4 events x 4 answers (so 16 words or more), along with your birth name and social security number or tax id (in typical form... with dashes, for example), and you have a pretty strong, potentially memorable pass phrase.  You can even write down the clues and post them prominently, and only you will remember them.
Pass phrase:  "Bob Eaton locker shove Landen Elementary School Karen Grits chair fart room seven Sam Hartzler job offer Florida Jim Artman railroad stick Middletown BeCoingInABit 123-45-6789"   
Capitalization is tough... but just capitalize proper nouns, or nothing at all.  Your call.
And frankly, just two events x four questions, plus your name and tax id number are extremely strong.

I also realize that each cube can be solved in less than 20 moves, but this program is selecting the moves randomly, so 39 moves is not "rather pointless" and actually DOES increase entropy.  
You could make the same argument with a deck of cards - that [7 shuffles is sufficient]( to provide complete randomness or something like that.  Yes, 7 well executed, mildly random riffle shuffles could do that.  But 7 perfect riffle shuffles will produce the exact same result every time.  
The idea of more than 20 random moves is to avoid the highly likely situation that 20 moves doesn't provide enough randomness.  This shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Some of the random flips will undo previous randomness; others will duplicate patterns that could be arrived at in other ways.

Imagine a blockchain of blockchains.  Each new block confirms all the other blockchains, which hold the bulk of the transactions.
This would be relatively trivial to evolve Bitcoin into.  And to spend your coins, you'd be responsible for holding onto your past transactions' blocks, so that the recipient could see that your money is good.  A small number of blocks would need to be checked to see if the coins were spent.  There could be a blockchain maintaining a list of all unspent transactions.
There are a lot of reasonable solutions to the blockchain issues.  But these aren't the 2014 problems.

Well, the theory says that if you get a portfolio of high risk, low-correlated assets, you can reduce the risk without hurting the potential rewards.  Of course, purchasing dog performers will hurt no matter what.
I try to be aggressive across my portfolio, and include aggressive stocks.  Junk bonds (potentially high risk, high return) have a low correlation.  And, if you are in a qualifying state (I am not), you can look at funding high-risk crowd-funded debt (like lendingclub.com or prosper.com).  Also, high risk real estate (buy REITs during this recent downturn in real estate prices), and maybe precious metals.
I understand the theory, but in practice, I am mostly aggressive stocks and Bitcoin. 
Here are some links for the theory, in case you are interested:

Thanks, WSJ, for not putting this behind the pay wall like usual!
The article mentions the difficulty of having 127,000 creditors spread out worldwide, having to approve any rehabilitation plan.  It's my understanding (and has been discussed here before) that he needs 50%+ percent of the creditors to approve, *by debt amount*.  So he just needs to reach  the largest creditors, not the majority of all creditors.
If I recall correctly, this was less than 1000 creditors that he'd need to convince of a viable plan, assuming he can get 100% of them to agree.  Otherwise, he needs to go deeper into the list and convince more. 
I wonder if he started down the list, and wasn't able to convince (or reach) some of the big guys.  It wouldn't surprise me if one or two of the really big debt holders are hard to reach (bitcoin thieves, pseudonymous people, people in jail who aren't replying to emails sent, etc.)

The easiest way to explain it, I think, is to say that the Bitcoin Accountants (the miners) close the books approximately every ten minutes.  
When they close the books, you can calculate exactly which addresses have bitcoins in them.  
The act of closing the books is the act of "solving a block" which specifies which transactions are included in that block.  Conflicting transactions may be competing for a spot in the block, but cannot be contained in the same block.
Once the block is solved, the any conflicting transactions will be resolved by one or the other transaction appearing in the block.  
@_date: 2014-04-14 09:46:35
Possible technically?  Yes.  But you need to get a majority of people to agree to the change, and that would be extremely difficult. 
Some very influential leader could try to persuade people to buy into it, under the guise of making Bitcoin more fair to the late adopters or some such B.S.  I'm sure someday someone will try.  But I think it's unlikely to succeed.

TBI, I am trying to understand just a part of what you are saying.   I agree that in many cases, FIFO would be a bad choice.  


But I would think that FIFO would result in longer-terms, so less likely to have income vs. capital gains.

Is there any core developer energy or thought going toward creating a simplified registration process for side chains that want to subscribe to merged mining?
It's my understanding that namecoin (and each coin that wants to do merged mining) needed/needs to convince mining pools to include merge mining *their* coin.  I am wondering if it would be technically possible to have a simple registry of side chains, to promote innovation and ease of implementation.
Maybe this would be a use for side chains itself.  MergeMineCoin could act as a side chain in which each block contains block headers for various other side chains, and then Bitcoin Miners would only need to run code that merge-mines MergeMineCoin.  New side coins could come and go, by registering on MergeMineCoin.
It's the middle of the night, and this idea makes a lot of sense to me... sorry if it sounds like the ramblings of a bad dream.

Seems like you are aiming for perfect security, especially with the talk of XOR-ing.  No problem with that; it only costs you a little more time.  But practically speaking, there's a such thing as "good enough security".
And if you are just guarding $20 worth of Bitcoins, you're obviously in overkill territory here!

The rules need to be very clear (obviously, spelling and capitalization and punctuation and spacing are critical).  But this is far easier to remember than 12 words handed to you.  What will you do with those 12 words?  Probably write them down.  Probably practice them.  Probably make sure they are committed to memory before committing tons of money to them.
Same thing holds here.  If you need to practice them, practice them.  But your learning curve can be dramatically shorter.
I'm quite confident in this system - much more so than in 12 random words to be stored in my brain.  And the rules can be written in plain sight, without giving up the phrase, and/or remembered.  
Edit: But you make a valid point.  Variations are killers in this system (although if variations narrowed it down to 1000 choices, I'd be good with that.  It's millions or billions that I worry about).   You need to know the phrase *exactly*.

I think the commercialization of this product is to get the working prototype (as OP has done), and then work with the major pump manufacturers, who already have pumps that handle cash and credit cards, and help them to work this into their current product.
The prototype shows that Andy is qualified (perhaps uniquely qualified) to help pump manufacturers integrate Bitcoin.
It'd be a very big project to retro-fit every Shell station with Bitcoin pumps.  But I suspect it's going to happen in the next ten to twenty years.
More simply, Shell stations will probably end up treating Bitcoin transactions as cash transactions, and settle at the cash register between now and then.
