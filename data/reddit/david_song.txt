77% of the gdp comes from business,
what percent of that comes from corporations vs non corporations? (sole proprieterships)
the answer will greatly affect whether or not i go buy some bitcoings'
why? because i don't think corporations will be willing to hold bitcoins any time soon...

Here is another way it's valuable.
the people holding our dollars in the bank can over leverage themselves and make ridiculous investments that force an entire country maybe world into recession.  those money grubbing jerks would no longer would have access to the funds.
that does not mean that the government should not tax bitcoins and that you should evade taxes, tho.
although i can imagine a future where instead of govts making roads, you have like kickstarters where people send their bitcoins to get roads built and stuff.  that would be cool.
the flip side is cyber crimes would be near impossible to track.

Also, There is a private key and public key that are generated through some sort of cryptography.
if you compared to something like email:
the private key is like a password and the public is the username.
For an email address the password and username are created arbitrarily and seperately and are not linked to each other.
where as a private key and public key is linked.
Sort of Understanding that made me go "holy shit" even though i don't know exactly what happens with the cryptography art when the keys are generated,  but i'm pretty sure that part is 100% legit.
maybe it wil helsp a little

Yeah, Wouldn't it be more like, if you were the bitcoin lender you would have to make loans at interest rates that are higher than the rate of increase in purchasing power to have any incentive to make a loan?
