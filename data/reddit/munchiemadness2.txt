Load money onto your usd wallet on Coinbase then get Coinbase pro and move your usd onto the usd wallet on pro then put in a limit order and you can buy bitcoin without a fee.

Some cards have different limits than others. I use a credit union debit card and my limit is 750 a week. My friend uses his Wells Fargo card and it’s a 20000 limit.

Go to bitcoin.org and do some research on there. They have basic info on it all. Best wallet is cold storage or hardware wallets like Trezor or ledger. Never keep high amounts of money on an exchange. You picked a great time to buy though with the recent price drop.

Bitcoinaddress.org. Make a cold storage wallet. There’s some good tutorials on YouTube.

I’m not sure. You couldn’t factory reset it and erase that?

I saw an interesting thread where someone pointed out you could go buy a brand new laptop and make paper wallets with it then return the computer when your done. Saves the hassle of worrying about if your computer may have a virus that can hack your wallet.

You could. I’d recommend making a paper wallet and just store in a safe place. Make backups and store in different places if you want. But I wouldn’t really stress about the wallet until you have a significant amount of money invested. Also you could do a test run by putting a small amount into the wallet just to make sure it works.
