Humans are naturally oppressive so they will always try to exploit others for thier own gain. This is why it's best to be antinatalist and refuse to have children. By doing this you contribute to stopping the growth of humanity and therefore contribute to stopping the growth of exploitation and oppression. You also save up a considerable amount of money you can invest in bitcoin.

I know many people who live with parents but are millionaires because they have zero expenses and invest the money. But what is your definition of poor? Under $1 million?

To fund the wall, the conservative culture, and the shipping of people, you need to raise revenue, which means you need to tax people. But isn't tax theft?

There are many societies and cultures beyond countries. A society is just a group of people with some shared ideas e.g. bitcoin users are a society. The "culture" of bitcoin includes the protocol and the community behind it. 
The problem is that governments are nothing more than thugs in suits who extract wealth and demand that slaves under them give them loyalty. This is patriotism. Patriotism is loyalty to the local warlord. 
The problem is that most governance structures of countries are not decentralized, even in democracies, which has allowed for an elite to hijack the system. By design, bitcoin attempts to be decentralized. Whether it continues to succeed is to be seen, but a two-party system does not decentralize power, and democracy is only a facade.

My understanding of Sharia compliant investments is that they avoid debt, so banks are mostly ruled out. Bitcoin threatens to destroy banks, so it makes sense that bitcoin is highly sharia compliant. However, blockchain lending platforms or even borrowing money to invest in BTC may not be sharia compliant.

Criminals use cash as well. Most drug organisastions use US dollars.

I believe that both patriotism and nationalism are delusional. Government is merely about a competition for power. How countries form is that local crime groups compete for power in an area. Power is a winner-takes-all game, so the winner of the game becomes the government. The reward for being the government is racketeering (i.e. tax). Patriotism is merely propaganda to convince the victims of racketeering to pay their protection money and to maintain the system that enriches the local crime family. Country borders are nothing but invisible lines drawn on maps by powerful people. Once you think of government as nothing but organized crime, you eradicate the slave attitude (i.e. patriotism) that you've been brainwashed into accepting. 
When I think about the nature of government, I think beyond these localized oppressive crime syndicates (also known as countries) and think of the possibilities of distributed ledger technology.

People who say governments are corrupt advocate for a global government?
I know of no one who does this. A global government is just nationalism applied on a global scale.
The answer is individualism over collectivism.

Isn't patriotism collectivism and collectivism is against individualism?

Problem is there is rarely any consensus among groups of people. There are no true groups of people since fundamentally we are all individuals and groups are defined in our heads, so everyone operates according to different classifications.

In any organization, there are those who get better deals compared to others regardless of whether they are labelled "citizens" or not. E.g. a banker in a country may be a citizen who gets a bailout if his company fails so he can try any venture and make huge profits but if it doesn't go well, he gets money printed for him. Then there are non-citizens who work considerably but get paid very little.
As Andreas Antonopolous said, it's about exercising "voice or exit." If you don't like an arrangement, voice it and if it doesn't work then exit it and enter into arrangements with others. 
I recommend the [perpetual traveller]( lifestyle whereby you diversify by having residence in multiple countries or travelling to multiple countries so you have an exit plan if any one country doesn't serve you.

Well personally I travel to different countries quite a bit e.g. I travel to Bangkok and Pattaya maybe once a year. I find borders to be a hassle. Visa requirements are a hassle as well. Having less restrictions at the border and more of a free market attitude would be better because people can sell or buy services all over the world. This will increase worldwide wealth.
