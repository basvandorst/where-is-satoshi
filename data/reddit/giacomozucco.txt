No reason at all to have specific "blocks" if you aren't using the original blockchain design (that is WITH Proof of Work).
If you are just asking some predefined functionaries to sign (no Sybil attack at all), they can sign every transaction independently.
If something like a secure "Proof of stake" really did exist (it doesn't), you could just have stakeholders to select a specific history one transaction per time. 
The only reason you have 10min blocks is to penalize orphans production, creating a cost in attacking the system. 
A chain of cryptographically linked transactions is not a "blockchain": we already had it with eCash in 1990. The block chain is the structure conceived to host PoW technique and Mining incentive system to get a decentralized time-stamp reducing Sybil attacks occurrences.

It doesn't help to encourage people to use this kind of clearly misleading terminology. 
Sure, you can call every "hash-linked database with digital signature" with the name "blockchain", but that's generate a number of potential misunderstandings.
- I read somewhere that " the blockchain is immutable" (the Bitcoin one is, in a practical sense), so now I believe that every hash-linked database with digital signature share the immutability feature, but this is false.
- I keep hearing that "blockchain is a branding new, revolutionary tech", so now I believe that every hash-linked database with digital signature is something new and exciting, which is not (ds exists since the '90s). This can mislead you in many way, i.e. in investment considerations.
- I know that some people are very expert in "blockchain" (i.e. Bitcoin), so I assume they are also expert in general applications for hash-linked databases with digital signatures, but that's generally false (and the other way around: some MongoDB or Git experts are very skilled in what you need, but you assume they are not, because they don't know Bitcoin&amp;co).
- I read somewhere that " blockchains will bring financial freedom and permissionless innovation" (Bitcoin will), so now I believe that every hash-linked database with digital signature will have this kind of social implication, which is absolutely false.
If people refers to onion sites as "The Deep Web", experts correct them. If people refers to a transistor (that works thanks to quantum tunnel effect) as "Quantum Computing", experts correct them. If people refers to OneCoin as "cryptocurrency" experts correct them.
If people refers to database without a PoW system to serve an open pseudonymous network avoiding Sybil attacks (and so has no use at all for "blocks" and "blockchains"), then experts should correct them.
There is not the "right" use of a terminology, but there are confusing uses and clarifying uses. If an expert promotes a confusing use of terminology, I suspect he is just trying to profit from ambiguity.

Well...even multiplying the straight probability of being randomly selected among posted addresses times the probability this being a scam (0.9), this is so far more fair than a typical lottery. And with a free ticket. Whatever. If I win, I will give back funds to bitfinex customers that are girls and good-looking.

First of all, I would like to thank Kevin for this criticism. It's being harsh, but not unfair, and I think it's a super healthy sign for the ecosystem as a whole, and a useful warning/feedback for this effort in particular.
I will try to post a reasoned answer later on (I hope tonight, maybe tomorrow morning), elaborating my view and detailing which concerns I actually share and which ones I think are instead maybe more the consequence of some misunderstanding.
Some quick point in the meanwhile.
Concerns I don't actually share (but which I understand are 100% good faith, and which I understand I may have generated with bad communication choices):
\- I think the critics assume a role for this effort that is very far from what we intend. In particular, we do not intend to "Represent Bitcoin" in the eyes of the MSMs and of the noobs, and we are honestly committed to take any necessary step to make this very clear.
\- I think the critics overestimate the role of the people on stage during the announcement, and assume a criteria for their "selection" that is far from the real intentions. In particular, the intention was not to gather "the biggest number of Bitcoin celebrities possible". The announcement itself was discussed at the presence of some very famous (current and past) Bitcoin Core contributors, who were with us in the backstage of the conference, yet they have not been involved, since their role is different (possibly beneficiaries of donation of bounties). The people that was called on stage are not among the "most famous" people, but among "the kind of people already individually interested in managing donations for Bitcoin development". They will mostly not have legal commitments or official roles. Some of them will receive and  (hopefully) use some git-based privilege in order to review/accept/reject, in a completely transparent way, PRs from donors and from developers. They will not sign "non-compete" agreements, they will be able to serve as reviewers in other foundations/associations/projects (maybe even the ones that will launch by cloning our very same donation software, which will be released MIT on GitHub), they will continue to work on their own for profit efforts.
\- I think the critics overestimate the actual damage inflicted on Bitcoin by any kind of ambiguity in this regard...EVEN if this effort was doomed to be perceived as "official" an thus to be hijacked in order to attempt yet another hostile takeover...well...Bitcoin quietly survived the Bitcoin Foundation scandals, the mutiny of its "Chief Scientist" against Bitcoin, the attack suffered back then from the banking system along with R3's Mike Hearn, the attacks suffered right now from Bitcoin(dot)com "official" website and from the (At)Bitcoin Twitter handler, the 2X cartel, the Bitmain monopoly over ASICs production and hashrate, etc. The damage on the reputation of the people who got involved in these attacks have been enormous, while the overall effect on Bitcoin could be considered even positive, as far as anti-fragility is involved. This is not as to say that we want all to become the bad guys here...but that even if we did, Bitcoin will just destroy us, as it should.
\- I think the critics underestimate the utility of a more efficient "marketing &amp; PR" effort. In my view, it's not that Bitcoin need such an effort (and I think I stated that clearly during the presentation), especially in the long run. But, in the short term, there are a lot of resources (financial, intellectual, etc.) currently wasted on scams, vaporware, snake-oil, and that's because of the marketing capabilities of the centralized entities pushing for such "crypto" schemes. I don't think they can represent a sustained threat to Bitcoin in the long run. But they are causing a huge misallocation right now. Fighting that scammy marketing effort with another marketing effort of the opposite sign (as centralized, but hopefully more honest) would not "save Bitcoin", but would save many people (both donors and developers) from wasting money and time on scams. The "marketing &amp; PR" we are talking about here is not of the "Bitcoin is cheaper and faster than PayPal" kind, but of the "developers, stop wasting your time writing useless solidity dapps and just learn to integrate LN payment in your webapp"/"businesses, stop wasting your money funding useless blockchain projects and just fund some realistic use of OpenTimestamps instead"/"normies, stop wasting your money investing in shitcoins and just put a small percentage of your asset allocation on Bitcoin, learning how to do not to lose those funds" kind.
Concerns I actually share:
\- I agree, in retrospect, that many of the concerns above has been generated by some early (wrong) communication choices. The name, for example, was probably a bad idea. I take every responsibility for that. We rushed the announcement because it was "sentimentally" important for us to give it in Riga (the place where the first discussion about this started, one year ago, during a dinner with Max, Adam, Elizabeth and Alex). We didn't have time do discuss/evaluate/get feedback about that. Since the underlying legal structure for the effort (for reasons I will try to disclose exhaustively in the complete answer) ended up to be a Foundation, and since we wanted to have some reference to Bitcoin in the name (since the focus of this donation management effort will be Bitcoin), I proposed to pull a joke about the original scammy Foundation and about Bcash, with "B Foundation". It understandably generated some ambiguity about our effort being directed at seeking some kind of "official representation of Bitcoin". Also, when we had to share the names of the people who were interested in the participation, I pushed for an self-ironic "ICO advisory page". Same kind of mistake: assuming that what is clearly an inside joke in the context of a maximalist conference would not be taken seriously after going viral on the Internet.
\- I agree that this common effort DOES represent a centralization, and thus a relative increase in fragility (and corruptibility) if compared with our previous individual efforts of the same kind. In exchange of an increase of efficiency. I see the concern, and I see the trade-off, here. While in the past three years nobody ever protested about me donating money, time, resources to Bitcoin projects under the label of my own non-profit effort (BHB Network), the size, the visibility and thus the potential to become a target of this new more "collegial" effort are clearly higher. We are well aware of it. Still, we decided that, while something like Bitcoin needs itself to stay on the safe side of the maximum anti-fragility possible (even at the cost of sacrificing some efficiency), something like our donation management effort needed instead more efficiency (even at the cost of sacrificing some anti-fragility).

Literally: "I'm the biggest part of the reasons Bitcoin is so popular today. I did it once, I'm going to did it again with Bitcoin Cash". Delusional magalomaniac.

Not entirely accurate. I am a pragmatic guy, I know how to compromise. I usually accept the most widespread shitcoins in the market closer to my everyday life (USD, EUR, CHF). I convert them into sound money asap.

Why "at least 2"? I find that number arbitrary (and suspect, because arbitrary). At least 3 coins (actual Bitcoin plus 2 different altcoins) are supported by some group of people as "the real Bitcoin". There is a 4th group of people stating that "the real Bitcoin" is an "index" of any altcoin which gets distributed based on (actual)Bitcoin UTXOs snapshots. There are 10/20 altcoins w/ "Bitcoin" in the name. The number "2" sounds like an attempt to give a special status to BAB, which is just one out of thousands of altcoins w/ no special status.

War is already over, and miners (and tycoons) trying to control Bitcoin have lost it. That's all. The only odd thing is that, while they are unconditionally surrendering, they do so pretending to have accomplished some kind of "fair compromise". Core devs will never push for a completely useless, politically motivated, rushed, unreviewed and untested hard fork (the first in Bitcoin's history!!!) just in order to reward bad actors that tried to politicize and control the protocol. SegWit will be locked in by miners, otherwise they will be orphaned by BIP148. And no one will run btc1. Miners may be corrupted, but they are not stupid. They will run they modified versions of Core, as always, just playing with signaling bits.
