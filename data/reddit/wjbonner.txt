I actually disagree with this fairly strongly.  It should be fairly rare that someone is so poor at grasping concepts that something as simple as a public ledger should be incomprehensible just because it is implemented cryptographically instead of via pen and paper.
This perception that some large segment of the population "just won't get it" is dangerous, especially since (imo) the problem lies not in peoples ability to understand, but in the bitcoin communities ability to explain.
Let's be honest, the majority of people involved in bitcoin are only vaguely aware of how it all works.  And that is fine.  But how many people here can really go into detail on the projective spaces, or algabraic structures that make the crytpo algorithms safe to use?  And what portion understand the implementations of these concepts as data structures in code, and then understand the algorithms that tie all of it together, and on and on.
It's ok to not understand the nitty gritty, or at least not all of it.  And how much to explain depends on how savvy the person is.  I've explained bitcoin to many older, non-technical people with great success because I give clear pen and paper analogs to how the technology works, using simple, relatable terms.  Yeah, none of these people are going to be forking peoples git repos, or even actively participating in bitcoin, but they are certainly able to understand the concepts it if it is explained in a way that they can relate to.

Just in case you are still having any issues, you might look up the [list of banks in your area that have SWIFT codes]( and see what their fees are for outgoing transactions.  I've done international transfers for large amounts of money before and for the most part if the banks are competent they are quick and painless.  Most banks also charge flat fees.  I've moved similar amounts of money for as little as $40 in fees.  What can get you is the exchange rate, which is why once you have a list of banks with SWIFT codes you can call them up and shop around for the best fees/exchange rate.  Keep in mind that the banks with higher flat fees might have slightly better exchange rates.  I've gotten some exceptional exchange rates by shopping around.  Good luck!

What a great post, thanks for this.  As someone who has been investing, day trading, and mining in bitcoin and other crypto currencies I've been dreading how to handle taxes, or honestly even how to prepare all of the information for a tax professional to handle.  I talked with the local H&amp;R and brought a copy of all of my trades, records of mining proceeds, costs, etc... and they basically said thanks but no thanks as far as hiring them.  This at least gets me a step in the right direction.

That's a bit of a one sided assessment.  I actually find credit cards very useful.  I have two, one for day to day expenses and bills that can be payed by card, and one for Costco.  I pay them off regularly and haven't payed interest in 10+ years.  I get consumer protection such as purchase protection, trip insurance, fraud protection, etc...
In my entire life I've had to charge back 1 purchase.  Any guesses as to what company?  BFL.  And who had my back when BFL wasn't being on the level?  Visa.  Contrast that with bitcoin, where in one year of making transactions I've been defrauded (by [buy a hash]( who refuse to send what I've payed for).  If I want my btc back I will need to take them to court, and they still might not pay.
So yeah, as much as I think the technology has a lot to offer you can't just be blinded to the benefits of the existing system.  Bitcoin needs businesses that offer services commensurate with what consumers have now in order for them to even consider switching.

Almost the same thing with me, only it was 7-8 btc at $90 from last week.  Supposed to clear last night at 6, cancelled 5 minutes before for being high risk.  The problem I have with it is that they would have told use 4-5 days ago that they thought it was high risk and we could have used another service, or gotten a support ticket in.  Just bad service.  I recommend Dwolla-&gt;CampBX personally, and I have used a lot of different methods.  If you have the time dwolla-&gt;CampBX is definitely the best imho.

I recommend using several exchanges, and dividing your assets between them.  I used bitfloor, but because it was one of 4 exchanges I used with assets equally distributed I only have 25% of my funds out of play.  The other three I use are mtgox, bitstamp, and campBX.  I have had good luck with bitstamp and campbx so far and have used gox less and less.  I also personally recommend keeping a split of btc and usd in each exchange to give you maximum flexibility, as well as arbitrage potential.  Just make sure to have different passwords for each site, and if possible enable two factor auth.  Cheers!
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:03:20
There is a lot more to plausible deniability than just having a fake wallet open up when a fake password is typed in.  Even truecrypt's hidden volume feature only allows for plausible deniability when properly used, and has inherent risks of data loss.  
You have to consider all kinds of factors such as  plausible deniability of what?  If you are being arrested and are forced to divulge a password to avoid jail time then having your password unlock a 1TB truecrypt volume with 1gb of fake documents and pictures of cats would not fool anyone for a second.  Also, you need to make sure that if you open documents from a hidden volume that your OS does not keep a record of that, such as recent documents.  So you could only mount the hidden volume from a stateless live OS, or just be really careful about what you open.
In the case of bitcoin clients, if only a few bitcoin clients have features that can aid in plausible deniability the assumption is going to become that if you use those clients then you are using those features, unless one of those clients becomes very popular for other reasons.  The reality is that plausible is very very hard to provide easily, and rarely holds up to serious scrutiny.  So lets say someone (government, etc...) has reason to believe that you have a lot of bitcoins.  So you give them the fake password to a wallet with like 5btc and a handful of transactions.  They won't buy it.  You would need to manufacture a comprehensive transaction log that would fool them into believing it was legit.
There just isn't any way to have easy plug and play style plausible deniability.  You can provide the tools, and point people in the right direction, but that is about it at this point.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:41:38
Yeah, I saw the same message and decided to assume the risk of the market dropping over the 4-5 day wait, which is why it was such a punch in the gut to assume that risk and then have them cancel last minute.  I didn't have any way to cancel had things gone bad price wise, but apparently they can just pretend it is a high risk transaction if the price goes up.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:23:41
That bitcoin is an experiment is hardly something most people would argue with, supporters and detractors alike.  The specifics of it, the viability of it as a currency is where any debate would be.  
Further, the last article Krugman wrote on the topic of bitcoin doesn't even make any negative comments about it, other than pointing out a demographic overlap between people who invest in gold and people who invest in bitcoin.  Given the anti-government, libertarian rhetoric that was so common on this subreddit in the weeks leading into the latest bubble, that is hardly a difficult conclusion to come to.
All Krugman really did is say that he thinks the existing currency is fine, hardly some sort of attack on bitcoin that demands a response.  All of this is beside the point that the method you used to try and initiate this "debate" is juvenile and the modern day equivalent of showing up outside his work with a mega phone and saying you will "school him".  Completely juvenile and unprofessional.  If you actually want to engage serious people in meaningful dialogue, and possibly change some peoples minds and opinions, you're going to have to act like an adult and engage in more respectful conversations.

The main problem with most companies accepting BTC is that they are, at the moment, unable to turn around and pay there expenses directly with BTC.  Valve is like many retailers in that once they make a sale they transfer funds to the developers, pay for utilities, etc...  The more people you have to pay the more complicated it is to make the transfer from BTC to a currency that your suppliers will accept.
Further, given the time lag in BTC transfers accepting BTC would increase the time it takes to disperse funds received, and would require paying some sort of transaction fee for the conversion.  Another issue is the price fluctuations of BTC relative to other currencies.  No company wants to accept payment in a currency if they suspect that when they convert it to the currency they pay there suppliers in, will have lost value causing them to pay out at a loss.
I'm sure that these problems will slowly work out over time, but I wouldn't hold my breath for companies that have a lot of financial obligations with individual sales to accept BTC for a while.  Things like OKC are easier because when you sign up for there service,they don't have to turn around and payout a third party, they can just either convert, or if the BTC price has gone down, wait for it to go up.

I'm a mathematician... I certainly know what an inflection point is.  It is where the rate of rate of change is zero, and as your first graph shows you reach an inflection point before a local max or min, which would be the turning point of the value change.  Your second graph outlines that not all inflection points are immediately followed by a local extrema, but the fact is every local extrema of btc value will be preceded by an inflection point, hence my use of it as a market indicator.

Yeah, when you use Dwolla you link a bank account like with coinbase, and the funds show up in your dwolla account after a few days.  After that you can initiate a transfer from CampBX, which is processed within 6 hours, usually less.  I have had good experiences with it so far, and it requires less hoops than funding a mt gox account.  There verification is also done a lot faster if you want to get an increased monthly dollar limit.  Cheers!

The transaction fees will have to rise to be processed by the miners as the rewards diminish.  Assuming sufficient adoption there will always be enough transactions that people really want to go through so they will set a high enough transaction fee to be included in a timely fashion, and miners will just reject transactions below a certain threshold.

This is precisely what I feel the problem is with BTC.  Let's say you have a new user who likes the idea of sending money internationally for purchases or to family.  They don't want to go through a currency exchange everytime they want to buy something or send money, so they convert $2000 into BTC to have to spend.  Well, since the goods and services they are buying are likely pegged to either USD or some other more stable currency, it is possible that your purchasing power will have dramatically dropped (or increased).  To a normal user this is unacceptable, they expect, rightfully so that there buying power will only change by very small amounts over the course of months or years.
So to anyone saying that the price of btc doesn't matter, it absolutely does.  Now, it doesn't matter if it is high or low, just that it is stable.  Until this occurs regular people will not use it for transactions.

I would expect a short term price drop as the difficulty adjust to the new hash rate of the network.  It will probably take a few iterations of the 2016 block adjustment process before the rate of issuance settles more and more back towards the one block every 10 minutes.  During this phase there will be some miners who need to pay back their investment into the hardware so they will be selling.
Honestly though, I don't expect much long term impact.  After a few months or so and the rate of hash growth normalizes the rate of issuance will normalize, and as such the price will be unaffected.  Of course I could be completely wrong, so caveat emptor.

I don't suppose you guys could change when you notify people that their transactions are cancelled due to being "high risk".  I had purchased from you guys before without a problem so last week purchased around 7-8 btc at around $92, supposed to clear last night at 6pm.  Five minutes before hand they get cancelled for high risk.  It seems like you guys could have told me 5 days ago and I could have sent money through Dwolla.
As much as I sympathize with combating fraud, things like this are just bad service, and two support tickets and 21 hours later and no response...  I just can't use a service like that to send $800.

I wrote that reply at 1:30am my time taking care of my sick wife and 7 month old, didn't really have time to go into a detailed explanation, and I meant exactly what I said, key logging or phishing could lead to it, but wouldn't be enough on there own.
For example, the code for the google authenticator has been packaged into a java jar file and can be executed on a desktop.  A compromised desktop in that case would allow the attacker to strip the OTP secret key out of a dat file.  So if your machine has a key logger it can be compromised like this.
Or if you were phished and taken to a well crafted site that mirrored Gox and passed the username, password, and 2fa code to the real gox site, it could then either programatically traverse the account and withdraw the funds, or it could hand the session over to a human to do it.  Personally I would just use a headless browser to automate the withdraw.
So there are two cases where key logging or phishing lead to the account being compromised and I can think of a dozen more.  Maybe next time someone doesn't explain something to your satisfaction you ask them to explain further rather than criticize.

My recommendation is to make an account at CampBX.  They are a small exchange but have been great to work with and they have fast dwolla transfers.  I don't think you have to be verified to transfer, but there verification process is faster than goxes, so I would recommend it anyway.  From there if you want on gox, just buy some btc and send to your gox account and trade away.
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:50:18
I use bitstamp, gox, and campbx, evenly distribute my btc/usd among them.  Campbx is nice because it is easy to fund, and from there you can buy btc, send to other exchanges, and trade.  The other nice thing is that any exchange can experience downtime under load.  So far I haven't had all 3 go down at once.  I used to use bitfloor as my fourth, but I still haven't settled on a replacement.

That's not true at all.  You overwrite the location where the data was stored and short of analyzing platters under an electron microscope you're not going to be recovering it.  If the wallet was written to a contiguous location on the drive that was never over written then the data could be recovered.  Depending on the default allocation unit of the OS he was using and how fragmented the drive was the wallet may or may not have been written contiguously onto the drive, making it much much more difficult to recover the data, again assuming that it wasn't over written or zeroed out (which is really just overwriting).
Most places use a 3 pass random overwrite to make sure hard drives they recycle are wiped, and if they had particularly sensitive or classified data more like 30 writes.  Still though, to say that the data is hard to destroy is pretty far off.

Personally, I am not all that fond of most of the posts with people trying to convince entity x to adopt bitcoin, so it's not like I am all for people recruiting porn studios to adopt bitcoin.  That said, I don't think all porn studios are the same.  Some operate in a fashion harmful to their employees and others don't.  I agree with you that the wrongs in the industry should be addressed, however I guess I disagree about whether if they adopt bitcoin or not will have any effect on those wrongs.
Personally I would rather see the community put together good resources for small businesses to accept bitcoin, something like a starter kit that they could order for a small amount of money that had all of the information and hardware they would need to start accepting bitcoin.  That way it would help adoption without the concern of looking like the community has any favor for any industry over another.

If they flag something wrong with your transaction, they need to notify you right away, not let you sit there for a week.  That is not how you run a business.

You never stop mining.  The amount of bitcoins created by each block mined is a converging geometric series, meaning in finite time there will always be a (small) amount created.  Thus it will require transaction fees to be high enough to incentiivize mining.  There will almost certainly be new hardware, but not because it is needed to process more transactions, just because it will become more energy efficient, etc...
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:56:53
Maybe.  The systems programmer and mathematician in me would agree.  I find many aspects of bitcoin to be very clean, such as using a converging geometric series to handle issuing currency, and salting with nonces to create a hash with a certain number of leading zeroes to control rate of issuance.  That said, none of these mathematical or technical concepts were new or gorund breaking when bitcoin was created, only in how they were applied to economics.  But I suppose it is in the eye of the beholder as to what it is.  :)
