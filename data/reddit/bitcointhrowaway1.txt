As I said, if energy becomes cheap and plentiful then it makes bitcoins energy usage more sustainable.  I don't rule it out, but it doesn't seem likely, it's not like people aren't trying already.
Both the economic arguments on the bitcoin myths page essentially amount to the same thing, energy production will get cheaper and more efficient, but what if it doesn't?.

Uh no, the energy usage should basically end up the same as it is now once everyone has switched to asics (assuming no growth).
It's a complicated system, but you could describe the average global price of electricity as a lower bound for the value of bitcoin.  If it isn't worth at least that then miners are losing money, some will stop and difficulty will adjust downwards.
If we assume the value of bitcoin grows, then people will keep mining (new miners, existing miners adding new hardware) until the difficulty makes the value of bitcoin roughly equal to the cost of power.
That's how I understand it anyway.

It's not impossible, but I believe the early coins that assumed to be his have not been moved, so he hasn't tapped that wealth yet.

Huh, I completely disagree, the political stuff doesn't worry me, if bitcoin get's banned it will probably end up being a good thing.
I replied above about the myths, I don't find them terribly convincing, a bit of handwaving and tadah!, bitcoin using a lot of energy isn't a problem anymore?.
The amount of energy needed to realistically prevent double spends, is derived from bitcoins value.  If bitcoin is extremely valuable, a lot of energy will be needed.  I think it is unlikely that most of this energy will come from sources we otherwise wouldn't be using if we weren't mining.

Unless someone is attempting a 51% attack, or worried that someone else is attempting a 51% attack.

This is a decent response, I think what everyone is missing though is the 51% attack, if a government, or large financial company started operating in bitcoin then they would be required to fend off any attempts at mining takeovers.  This is untenable in my opinion.
It may seem ridiculous to imagine people spending billions or trillions to disrupt an enemy economy, arguably though this is how the USA won the cold war against Soviet Russia.  A mining arms race between unfriendly countries does not seem far fetched to me.

I am not suggesting a centralized version of bitcoin, merely an improved version of bitcoin.  Read up on Proof-Of-Stake, if it's possible to get the same amount of double spend prevention with significantly less energy usage, then I think it will supersede bitcoin.
