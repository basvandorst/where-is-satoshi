The strains listed in stock are all in stock. We had a couple issues with selling things between the time we listed the initial products and the time we launched but that has been fixed now.

Our team is made up of Canadians and Brits where seeds are not illegal and are openly sold in stores. 
There is no need for us to legitimise anything as we are not breaking the law. It can be difficult to understand because of the hard line stance in certain US states but in the majority of the world cannabis seeds are not illegal.

I understand your first point but it is a pretty complicated issue.
As for taxes we run 2 non crypto businesses and are fully registered for taxes. It's a little complicated, right now we get our invoices in CAD $, then convert to BTC to pay them but file it in our quickbooks in CAD $. 
In terms of our sales tax it is a little complicated Canada treats bitcoin transactions as barter transactions. So we keep a record of all sales and their relative CAD value and then calculate the sales tax on that.

We only sell seeds not marijuana. The crime is illegally growing them, if you are a licensed medical patient or live in an area where growing is decriminalised then you can plant away.

Thanks for the kind words, we have 500 more strains to list over the next couple of weeks. So we will be growing!

The prices are for packs, the pack sizes available for each strain are inside each listing.
Thanks for pointing out the typo I'll correct that immediately.

We already got our biggest distributor on board. A guy in their warehouse was pretty heavily into it and talked them into it.

The law in Canada is very complicated, I am from the UK so there it is much simpler. Seeds are legal until you add water.
Here in Canada there is a distinction made between hemp seeds and cannabis seeds, so the legislation governing hemp seeds does not apply. In terms of Cannabis seeds the law does not specifically state anything other than NON viable seeds are excluded from the act controlled substances act.
There is no law specifically banning seeds. Hence one of the only convictions came in 1996 in the Regina vs Hunter case where the defendant not only sold seeds, he declared them to be for growing marijuana and also had a pot plant growing in the window. 
Now when you add the MMAR program and the legal minefield it gets even more complicated. I know that currently one of the old larger distributors is suing Canada Customs for seizure of a shipment of seeds and has RCMP officers as witnesses on his side.  
So while rather complicated, there is currently **no** law banning seeds. There are hundreds of seed stores in Canada and there is an Expo held yearly attended by seed companies from around the world where seed sales are listed on the contract of the government owned Metro Toronto Convention Centre.

No problem glad to.

It is indeed above board we already run 2 other non crypto businesses in Canada. We are registered with CRA for tax purposes and the house you suggest is actually a shared office space. While it's not our own office it at least gives us a physical address for mail and suchlike. The address is listed on our contact us page.
I agree my hosting provider is not very good but at the time they were one of the only ones using coinpayments and as I only had Litecoin to pay the bill we went with them. 
I understand that there is little chance of me converting you but as I said, we have a mailing address, we pay taxes and we stick to all local laws.

A few stores do but none of them are actually involved in the crytpo community.

I would agree on that one, he didn't help but publicly funding legalisation groups in the US though.
