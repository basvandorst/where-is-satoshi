The fact that im in the same boat with a person like that makes me feel like I have made some bad choices.

How can I send Bitcoin without a wallet ?
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:10:52
Thanks ! This helps to understand this better.

I dont like being on the same side as everybody else, usually itnhoes to shit.

Should we free everyone who got paid with Bitcoin for illegal activities?

This guy has a good track record of saying retarded things

Thanks. This is what I will do probably. People really pay such high fees for 2FA service ? Thats absurd.

Was trying to send BTC for the forst time using Electrum and the fees are like 18 EUR for a 84 EUR payment. Is this normal ? This is the lowest amount Electrum allows me to set.

I dont know what Im talking about myself to be honest. This is the first time I was trying to do a BTC transaction. Was trying to send BTC and this is the fee which was required. Not really much more to it.

Thanks for your answers. I guess it depends on what type of coin we are talking about as I have seen ICO for porn site where the coins could be used to request girls do something on webcam. I doubt that such coins would be worth something if that site went down.

But what benefit disributed ledger provides if there is still basically one place or business where the coins you buy via ICO are worth something ? I could have just created ICO for my business and stored the info in central ledger. If my business goes down, centralised ledger or not, the coins are worth nothing. There may be huge flaws in my logic though. Im quite new to this.

Isnt it possible that some day the code will change allowing more bitcoin and that it will be the consensus? I dont know what I am talking about btw.

Are there any tax consequences for the businesses if they accept bitcoin ? I mean, are the tax authorities ok with that ?

So this scarcity thing seems a bit exaggerated.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:06:52
Makes sense, but anyway I find it difficult to understand how each of these exchanges sets the price at any given point. Hypotethically, If 10000 people suddenly buy BTC on Coinbase, for example, the demand has clearly risen, but who says for how much the price will increase ?

That is like saying that first smartphone, car, etc. is the best ever, just because it was first, doesnt make much sense, if you ask me.
