Not idiots, but I worked at restaurants for a couple years and I can say based on my experience that many in the food services industry are not technically or financially savvy people. Many don't have bank accounts and they live paycheck to paycheck, and digital currency is simply not something in their wheelhouse. If the staff have a QR code set up, then that's great. But handing them a paper wallet is more than likely going to lead to confused stares followed by a short trip to the waste basket. And it doesn't even play to the strengths of bitcoin to begin with.

Let's be real... if the parents aren't already interested in bitcoin, then the odds of the paper wallet surviving 18 years is astronomically small. A hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger might be a little safer, but could just as easily get lost, and in that case I doubt they're going to have the recovery seed on standby. Or the parents will simply cash it in a year or two from now when there's a bull market.  
The safest approach would be to find a trustworthy escrow service that will release the wallet to the baby when he/she turns 18 and bitcoin is worth over $1 million USD. Otherwise it will almost certainly be lost or mishandled.

I just find it really odd that a guy who uses his platform to routinely censor individuals for a wide range of asinine reasons is now being championed as some kind of hero by the crypto community. His lifework to this point is essentially the antithesis of everything bitcoin stands for.

Hard to say what it does exactly without running the file in a sandbox along with a suite of security tools to monitor any registry key modifications or network callouts. I'd upload the file to virustotal to compare it with their database. But you probably should reimage the PC anyway. Why take any chances?

Congratulations on your prudent investment... now just keep in mind that one bitcoin has the potential to increase several magnitude in value over the coming year or two, and will likely be worth a small fortune soon. When the next bull market comes, there will be a lot of envious people on the sidelines. So it's best to keep a low profile IRL and not talk about it with ANYONE, aside from maybe one person you know well and trust so that they'd have access in case of some type of crisis.

Indeed, Dorsey's plans for bitcoin are the antithesis of the original ideals behind the distributed ledger. Dorsey owns Square, and I guarantee that he and his team are now at work on how to centralize authority of the network to maximize profit and silence opponents.

What an asinine statement. We live in an age where information is available within seconds at the touch of a keyboard. To imply that women are incapable of that is pretty demeaning.

Good points, and also I feel that paper wallets have been largely out of vogue in the crypto community for a couple years now, having been supplanted by hardware wallets in terms of security and ease of use. There are very few cases where it still makes practical sense to create one. Especially when transferring wealth from one individual to another.  And even more so when that recipient isn't particularly familiar with cryptocurrencies to begin with. So essentially this person will be receiving a confusing slip of paper, that they can't show to anyone, and it will take several steps and time invested into research to cash it out. And possibly a bank account, which they may not even have.   
Introducing someone to bitcoin via a paper wallet is like introducing someone to Star Wars by having them watch the 1978 holiday special.

That's the first time that I've ever seen that quote attributed to Buffet. And the correct quote is actually "Markets can remain irrational longer than you and I can remain solvent."

People tend to follow a herd mentality, so getting them to invest in a "dead" asset like crypto is going to be difficult. But why bother? If it drops further, they'll just blame you and sell at a loss or maybe even have it stolen. I've invested since 2012 and the only time my friends are interested is when we're near the end of a months long bull market. And even then, they don't really want to invest actual money, but they want to learn how to mine it on their computer because they think they'll become rich by sitting back and doing nothing. Then they forget about it again a few weeks later.
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:44:43
It's kind of the same way that everyone attributes the "buy when there is blood in the streets" to Buffet. He never said that one either. It's really not even Buffet's style of investing, which is what makes it all the more interesting. But I guess the average person can only think of Warren Buffet if they were asked to name a famous investor.

When people receive money, they want access to it with the least amount of work possible. So for a tip jar, cash is the obvious choice. I feel like bitcoin was never really intended as something to be printed off onto a paper wallet, and then handed around to people in place of cash. It's not its strength. I would at least make sure I could speak to the recipient and explain, and only if I thought he actually had interest in digital currencies. On the contrary, if a person has no interest (like the typical restaurant employee) it's going to be counterproductive in terms of bitcoin adoption and only leave a bad impression that bitcoin is a burdensome means of cash transfer. Just my two satoshi.

Coinbase is required to follow some pretty stringent KYC laws, and given that they often place holds on customer accounts due to minor inconsistencies between their site registration details and bank account info, I would conclude that the chances of this arrangement being possible are extremely slim.

Mr. Cotten, if you're in hiding and reading this, then I'd suggest you move to Chicago. As Jussie Smollett could attest, you can make up all kinds of crazy stories and waste law enforcement time and other public resources, and yet their state attorney's office won't even press charges. They'll have you do a few hours community service and let you go.

I worked in the food services industry for a couple years, but I've also worked several other jobs in my long and storied career. Based on my experiences, I'm led to conclude that most restaurant workers are not particularly interested in cryptocurrency. When money is concerned, their primary objective is to have it in cash so they can go out and spend it on tuition, rent, or gas, etc.

KISS principle... keep it simple, stupid. I know some people will split their seed into 4 different fragments and hide it around town, lock it in safes, password encrypt, and otherwise come up with some super complex security protocol. It sounds great, but then they come back a year later and realize they've forgotten where they put it, or they lost their passphrase, etc.   
Basically what I'm saying is, I would wager that far more people have lost their funds stored on hardware wallets because they've locked themselves out, rather than fall victim to some ultra-sophisticated attack by a third party.

If you want a simple answer, it's because liberals tend to form and shape their opinions on everything based on pop culture trends, because they think it gives them a better chance of being approved by their peers and fitting in. So if the mainstream media and their favorite celebrities are pissing and moaning about cryptocurrencies, then they'll probably adopt the same stance.

In some areas of Tokyo like Akihabara it might seem that Japan is ahead of the curve with crypto, but I've lived here for years as an IT consultant and speak fluent Japanese, and everyone I know is still very wary of cryptocurrencies in general. Like, really really opposed to it. Even the mere mention of bitcoin sends them into a state of dread because it's synonymous with drugs and black market crime in their eyes. And Japanese tend to be risk averse in general, so even the concept of investing in blue chip stocks frightens many of them.
I think it's just that the Japanese banking system is so ancient and full of fees, that some of the more clever and financially savvy people are looking for alternatives. The majority here still carry cash around everywhere and keep their savings at post offices or locked in a safe at home. So in a way, bitcoin  seems really suited to them, but the price fluctuations would surely terrify them.

I told them in 2011 that it would go to $10. They laughed. I told them in 2013 it would go to $1000. They laughed. I told them in 2015 it would go to $10,000. They laughed. Now I'm telling them it will go to $1 million. They're laughing now, but in a couple years they're going to be crying. And I'm just going to have to say, "I tried to tell you but you wouldn't listen."

My friends and colleagues haven't begun talking about any plans to use their home PCs to mine bitcoin yet, so that's how I know we're not officially in a bull market.

I basically ignore the voices saying that bitcoin will go up to only 20-50k in the next bull run. Why? These people don't have a firm grasp on the bitcoin 4 year market cycles and they don't understand the paradigm shift that is taking place right now in global exchange. If there is another bull run (which almost certainly there will be) we are heading way beyond those numbers and never looking back.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:43:48
You may be right. Don't mind the downvotes, a lot of people here have a strong emotional need to see the price go up and up and up. I personally think we have a bit further to go in this rally, but a good correction is likely within a few weeks to shake out all the people who FOMO'd in.

Just as we're beginning a modest price rally, China comes back to ban bitcoin again for the umpteenth time. It's like clockwork.
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:41:54
It's going to come back down, but the question is when and how much. But if you're feeling confident that we're on the verge of a large correction, then you should be shorting it.

Doesn't coinmama provide credit card purchases? It seems that a premium of \~5% or more is the going rate on that. So if you bought over the past couple days, then that seems about right. I wouldn't say you got ripped off, but you're always going to be paying a premium for credit card purchases vs bank wires due to the extra associated fees and risks.

Granny opens an account on an exchange and buys her first bitcoin.

Old people have a different world view and things like distributed ledgers and blockchain technology simply do not compute. I long ago stopped talking about it with my old man because he just doesn't get it. I mean, look at Warren Buffett. Most would consider him a brilliant investor, but he doesn't even know how to turn on a computer, and he uses an ancient piece of shit flip phone still because technology scares him. And since bitcoin and technology in general doesn't make sense to him, he hates it.   
If granny comes forward and expresses interest in bitcoin, then great. But if she's like most, then she's perfectly content to whip out the checkbook at the supermarket and hold up the queue for everyone else because that's what old people are comfortable with. And that's fine. Cryptocurrency is for the younger generations and will become the new standard going forward.

This. I feel like that's a key factor in the bitcoin 4 year cycle. It takes at least a year or two for investors to get over the embarrassment of "what could have been" and eventually find their way back to the market for one more shot at it.
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:34:13
I'm sure he's pissed. It sounds like he's been following bitcoin since at least 2011, and he's been wrong the entire time. I won't say that there's no merit at all in some of his arguments, but he's so angry and biased at this point that he can't see clearly and is really underestimating bitcoin's potential as a store of value and alternative to traditional investments and payment channels. He says it will be gone in 10 years, but most likely bitcoin will be trading at around $1 million (or the equivalent). I look forward to see his reaction then.
@_date: 2019-04-12 16:44:24
Well to be clear, I don't go around talking about bitcoin IRL much at all. Just as I don't go around talking about my bank account. I'm not out spreading the Satoshi Nakamoto gospel.  
But friends ask me about it occasionally, because they know I've dabbled in it for several years. So for instance, right now I'd tell them we're in a bear market and it's probably a good time to invest if they're interested. And I know what their goals are. Making money is pretty high on their list, like just about everyone. But the problem is most people are only motivated by instant gratification. Many of the people I know are no different. Living paycheck to paycheck is a lifestyle in the US.   
So they can invest if they want, or don't invest. It makes no difference to me. I could try to bring them along, kicking and screaming, on the journey ahead. But why bother? They're adults and can decide if they want to or not.
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:24:16
Well, it's easy to say that in a bear market. We might be moving into a bull market now, but IMO it's still early to make that call. So let's look again a year from now and evaluate if there is enough hype yet. I suspect there will be... and the next bull run will be even bigger than 2013 or 2017.

Anyone can use whatever phone they want. I don't care. But since I apparently need to spell this out for some of you, the point is: I'm not going to take financial advice on emerging technologies from a person who does not understand how a computer works or how to operate a modern telephone.
