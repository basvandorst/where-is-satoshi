How was this even news ? Was it not par for the course since at-least last year December ?
I mean apple made it quite clear this bitcoin thing wont work for them some time ago.
And honestly, if you have an iPhone, and your now affect by this, serves you right. If you did not know that Apple is like nazis about what runs on their phones when you bought it you are a bad comsumer, and should be scammed out of all your money before you hurt yourself with it. And if you did know and thought "ah but they are benevolent overlords that will never do anything bad" - yeah, Germany 1939, fun for the whole family.

Actually, this is true of houses also ... and of every single other thing - people who have an "inherent value" mentality is doing it wrong. No matter how much money you put into creating something, you still cant sell it above the price that the market decides, unless of course you are outside of a market economy.

So short all your BTC and be on your way. We delusional people who do think BTC has a future even through all the government opposition will stay right here.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:04:55


Its impossible to pin a future valuation on Bitcoin - but the current value is the market price, per definition. It did not crash because it was "overvalued" - it became overvalued because the parameters/reality changed.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:57:47
Dude, how come you did not tell us this in 2011 ? would have saved us all allot of heartache. Thanks for your insightfull post, I dont think there will ever be enough people in the world saying "I will "I told you so"".
Also STFU, you have no basis for your claims, its unstable now, yes, but that means less than nothing. Thank you, and GTFO ;)

OMFG GANDALF CAME DOWN FROM HOBBITON TO SHOW US THE "REAL" PRICE !!!! REPENT BEFORE SAURON FUCKS YOU IN THE ASS FOR BUYING/NOT-SELLING above 100 USD.
Dude, stfu about what you do not know. Sure, if its stable nobody will be making 10x gains in few days from it, but it wont make it not an investment vehicle, and we are years away from that either way. If a currency cannot be used as a store of value then its not really worth anything as a currency. If it does become prominent - and people do start using it as a currency in its own right, then it will at-least beat inflation - and the price would be way above 100 USD.

What merchant prices in BTC as opposed to ( x USD * USD/BTC rate )? I would applaud that guy - just not sure he exists. It would make sense though to adjust their prices if they plan on making a living.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:35:17
More interesting is a stretch, this does affect price - but upvote anyway as this is worth considering for the "OMG BTC IS DEAD FOREVER AND EVER COS I LOST ALL MY MONEYZ" demographic.

Another opinionated dinosaur that belies the way it is is the only way it can/should/must be.
Look - maybe we bitcoin fans are overly optimistic, but I'm not - sure it can die, and it might not replace the dollar - chances are very low that it will, but not 0.
So stop posting BS from haters without anything new to contribute.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:27:58
"I wish people with shut the fuck up about X, cos I don't care." ... other people may care ...
Saying it adds no value is misguided. Price encodes information, it has significance. Sure if BTC was not intended as something with value then it would be pointless - but it is, so it does matter.
And the nice thing is, you can ignore the price, just like you can and will ignore this reply.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:38:09
Wow, pointless platitudes much ?


Sure - until you would rather recover what you have left until you loose more ... nobody knows the future - it could be down to 0.01 USD/BTC in January - and 0.00000001 USD/BTC by Feb, and they could discover a fundamental flaw in the software in march, would you still suggest sell high ? And how are you to know that 1.2K USD/BTC was not a low - it would have kept going if not for the news from China. All in all, quite pointless advice.

@_date: 2013-12-18 22:02:08
Its a play on the psychology of everybody who has a clue and some money.
Is your point then "don't fuck up" ? cos holding now if price in Jan will be 0.01 USD/BTC will be fucking up. If you make risky investments you have to know when to cut your losses. And people in it to make short term gains should be prepared for bailing when it turns south - like they are doing.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:27:21


Second that opinion.

I really doubt that anybody likes the volatility of BTC except the people who are looking to make a quick buck.

If the world were that simple ;)
There is very little point in denying the facts: BTC China stopped deposits. Until there is some new developments there is little more to it. Sure its not an outright ban, but it is not nothing.
The price is back up now, but its likely a bull trap. I would not say the plunge is over until it is over for a week - sure you might be missing out on the moon rocket - but buying more now is a massive gamble.
As for what the impact is on BTC, its just that, decreased demand so decreased price.

@_date: 2013-12-18 22:16:27
So if you invested an amount your willing to loose you still would not sell half way down to 0 ? Doesn't really make allot of sense to me - if money is worthless to you then sure - but then why invest in the first place.
Look, if you believe in the BTC idea, then yes - don't sell - we need people like that - but if your a speculator that went in at 1.2K USD and you really don't have any positive outlook for BTC then its rational behavior to short now.
The true BTC believers will hold, but you cant say everybody must be a true believer, and you have no way of knowing if the true believers have anything.


If its really going to be a loss, then minimizing it is the right thing to do.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:20:05
