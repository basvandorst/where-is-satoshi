It would be tricky and software solutions for businesses just haven’t caught up. Mainly due to security issues. It will come in due time, I suggest you do still try but you will have to put in work and figure it out with the help of the community, who knows maybe it will attract customers that wouldn’t normally come to your bar. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:50:37
Awesome can't wait to try it out! 
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:17:53
Lol ok 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:11:26
it was an oversight probably, Satoshi was a genius but apparently he wasn't a very competent programmer. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:45:29
Hahaha good one
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:56:54
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:03:47
I appreciate you trying to grow the network but right now it’s not the best time since the user experience is not very good. For someone trying to pay a large bill then yeah it would but otherwise for just one beer it doesn’t make sense. I would wait for the LN to come around. Otherwise yeah try to get integrated with bitpay or some other exchange in your local area. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:15:58
Sorry but I don’t know what you’re talking about. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:41:43
That would be very hard to implement. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:26:44
Not to be pedantic but the preferred term is mining hash rate.

Hey I have everything I need for this guide except the hard drive with a dedicated power supply. It should work if I use a external HDD like a Seagate backup disk, right? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:40:32
I heard someone explain it and it sounded like you could make a lottery style wallet where you could verify that it was fair. 
Honestly that to me sounds like a killer app. Especially since people waste so much money on scratch tickets and loot boxes. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:21:19
Why are you being so open about it? Of course they don't want to have anything to do with Bitcoin there is no clarity on regulations. Tell them you have a computer business and are running a database center for data.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:32:41
you can use electrum on desktop 
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:15:33
Yeah honestly I think it would be great to have it so that you just download a file to an SD card and just plug that in. Would make it easy to onboard people.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:30:58
Even if there is some truth to that, which I’m sure there is since he probably has a ton of ETH (nothing against ETH either). However I think a more plausible explanation is that they built this very complicated backend a few years go and picked the wrong technology and now they are seeing the consequences when they have to scale up the system. This wouldn’t be a problem if they were a normal website like social media or image hosting, because the risks of messing up a social media website are much different than a website that holds peoples money. So I think they can’t figure out how to migrate their backend to a better more scalable framework. 
Having said that it’s still disappointing since they live in California which is home to a ton of talent. I think this clearly shows how incompetent they are and how difficult it is to work with bitcoin. I think it’s great we give coinbase a hard time because that’s the way it should be. Hopefully within a few years they will be obsoleted but I’m not sure what that would look like. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:25:50
As for the spam with all the noise that LN is generating, spammers are realising that they should spend their money on funding development rather than making miners rich. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:05:18
its not value based, it depends on the size of the transaction which can vary on how you format it and how many UTXOs it has
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:08:11
That’s true right now but new data structures and address formats will significantly reduce that. It also depends on what the inputs are sending freshly minted bitcoin is cheaper than sending dust
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:17:12
That’s a bold statement. Other DLTs don’t have scale and are centralized. You could be right r wrong but you’re certainly entitled to your opinion. May I ask which technologies you are interested in? I myself am interested in new and different CA’s and DLT’s. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:54:08
I hate when they say blockchain this and that. A blockchain is a linked list and is special only because it sits on top of a decentralized peer to peer protocol. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:32:04
The hardware wallets they have now are excellent for individuals. As far as I know there aren't any solutions for organisations if they want to manage Bitcoin. Sharing custody of bitcoin can be challenging and there obviously needs to be a solution so that its easy for a baker to a hedge fund to use it. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:23:26
You don't need to lie, its called equivocating, lawyers and politicians do it everyday professionally. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:34:04
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:41:36
Again centralized also movies and selfies are different than peoples money. To think people will rationalize as they did when adopting those technologies is not a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:09:07
You didn’t address my argument, which means you agree with it. 
The bitcoin cash roadmap will end up with zettabyte blocks if it reaches mass adoption. 
Also holding on to 9 year old design specifications is a bad idea. 
You’re not going to convince anyways so you’re better off just focusing on your coin and leaving me alone. 
I am going to do my thing and you should do yours. 
Best Regards,
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:55:20
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:26:16
Yeah honestly I am pretty sure people will open channels with zero or break even fees out of the kindness of their hearts. Many bitcoiners are altruistic in that regard. 
In fact it would financially behoove you to do so because then that means that more people can use it and the price would continue to increase.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:59:19
Yeah we will figure it out though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:22:19
Can someone explain to me the centralized bankers hub argument?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:20:06
Is that really a bad thing? There’s a lot of frivolous spending. Also people will spend at every point, if you want to buy a house, have kids, or your parents are sick you’re for sure going to cash out. I know I would. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:34:40
That's exactly right, the only problem is that it necessitates self-bootstrapping. Which is why everyone should start running a node and once the implementations are solid and well tested you should run a lightning node on top of your bitcoin node. 
It will be economically incentivized since you can charge fees for people using your node as a transaction and people will use your node based on fees and latency.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:21:46
I am expecting a raspberry pi 3 to be able to run this software. So if you have anything better then yeah go ahead. 
And that’s exactly right. You will set your own rules and if you want people to use your node you can pay them to do so. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:46:55
Well there is a cost tied to running a node but it’s very small especially if you’ve been holding bitcoin this past year. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:50:43
They certainly don't have to but they would get better performance. 
Anyone can open a channel, what's more is they can be a lightning node and charge fees to use the node to hop around the network. 
Most people in developed nations can run a node, all it takes is a raspberry pi and a hard drive. It's not really the cost is the willingness. I mean 100 bucks might price a lot of people out but there are lots of people that can afford that, they just don't wanna bother because there is no economic incentive. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:00:16
Spam is dealt with using a free market system where spam transactions are priced out. Its the best possible solution, only a few whales are able to spam the network at a large cost. Please explain a better way to me. If you increase the block size people are going to store their movies on the blockchain and make people store it for them on their nodes. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:51:13


It could have been worded better since I am trying to study for finals and having this argument is getting old. 
My main point is that by limiting the block size and allowing a fees market to develop, the network prices out spam. 
Otherwise, you keep increasing the block size and you cave into the spam. I was exaggerating for effect by saying users would store their movies on the blockchain, but what is stopping them? You're saying their sanity would stop them but that doesn't make any sense since you're assuming all users are sane or fully rational. There is no way that is true. Think about it. So right out the bat you cant assume that sanity will control spam, so what better mechanism is there? Please tell me! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:42:01
Yeah it was complete garbage 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:21:39
Why do bitcoiners love tails so much? I’ve used it a couple of time but I’m not clear why it’s so beloved...
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:15:13
yeah honestly I think they might be an older generation that have sunk their money into traditional assets and commodities and are a little bitter. 
It just strikes me as odd that the audience of that publication isn't a little bit better informed or better able to understand the concepts and technology. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:00:07
Protocol level add on a new layer that will operate on top of the bitcoin protocol. It’s not a business or a new altcoin (although companies are forming to develop their own implementation). Essentially this new layer will allow you to send money to other people such that they are routed via the lightning network instead of being mined into the blockchain. It is similar in a sense to how onion routing works. The only downside is that you have to commit bitcoins to a node in order to use it but as an upside you can collect fees from people using your node to hop their transactions across their network. 
This could potentially displace visa and MasterCard as far the level of txs/s are concerned. Bitcoin is currently 5-7/s whereas visa and MasterCard are 25k/s or so( might be wrong but that’s what I remember it being. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:11:37
As I understand it Schnorr crypto was patented up until a couple years ago. The patent just ran out so we can finally use it.

@_date: 2017-12-17 19:13:36
The only valid argument against bitcoin is the lack of historical context, which itself is a bit bland in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:11:33
Unless hes dead or very sick, if he is alive then yeah I doubt he lost access. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:11:06
Bitcoin cash is an altcoin with a scaling roadmap that makes zero sense. How long until we end up with zetabyte blocks? 
If bitcoin cash had any merits it would come up with its own original name instead of trying to leach off of the popularity of Bitcoin. 
Blockstream are just a group of devs that control the private keys to the github repository, if you submit good peer reviewed code they will merge your ideas onto the main branch. Otherwise they will tell you to keep reading until you understand the problem at hand. I'm glad they are there, they are smart people and if new proof comes to light that they are bad actors I will stop supporting the project.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:19:20
I understand. Thanks for the explanation. Does sound like a downside but should be able to be mitigated. I can imagine if there is enough pressure that someone will come up with flexible channels.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:12:51
Yes you can. You can also make the fees positive or negative which is pretty cool. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:15:14
Satoshi himself hardcoded the 1mb block size limit. He probably understood that routing big blocks through the network was a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:52:43
Very interesting, we need more of these. Also companies that perform testing, validation and standards. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:49:29

For what its worth you are doing bitcoin a great service. Its easier for a lot of people to get into something new and foreign if they have someone who can walk them through it. This makes the network grow. Keep it up as long as it doesn't cause you trouble and make sure you have good security. 
@_date: 2019-11-24 22:52:33

@_date: 2019-11-12 15:57:47
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:12:45
Depends on the use case. 
If you want to use it as a personal node then it’s probably fine. 
If you’re trying to use it to run a service then it’s probably not a good idea.
@_date: 2019-11-30 10:47:08
green wallet on ios and android, it has a tor option. 
Also, why are you asking onthis thread?
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:10:36
How would this setup change if you wanted the node to help bootstrap other nodes?
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:50:23
Ok so all you need is a full node? 
How do other nodes find out about you?
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:17:25
1 to choose my own rules and help others do so as well
2 the best node for the least money
3 yes and no
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:55:43
Yeah that would be scary. I hope they can deescalate peacefully.
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:29:10
This methodology is inadvisable. 
The biggest problem as others have said is that there is no backup of the seed and there is no guarantee that the flash media will persist up until the time that they need it and they do not have any guarantee that the bank will allow them to access their keys when they want. 
Also how do they know that there wasn’t a key logger in their computer when they generated the keys?
They can’t prove that someone doesn’t have to their keys. 
Tbh bitcoin core is amazing software but you actually have to be a professional to do this type of thing on. 
It wasn’t meant to support this workflow (casually generating keys). 
There are a lot of things they needs to do in order to securely generate keys. 
Depending on the amount I would buy a trezor or a cold card or use an old iPhone if they have one laying around. 
This is pretty high level threat model but better safe than sorry.

this is called time preference, read the bitcoin standard and you will be able to answer that for yourself.
@_date: 2016-12-30 08:35:19
Yes but your contribution would be so small compared to the rest. Which is why you need an asic miner, it's like your laptop but the hardware is optimized to run the bitcoin network, your spare is optimized for being a computer that has a good consumer experience with web browsing and productivity apps. 
I feel like to really understand it you need to be able to understand math and IT. There isn't really a way around it unless you can take facts for their face value and assume whatever you're being told is true. 
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:50:49
Your taking the meaning of that phrase to be wrong in this case. You actually don’t want a monoculture of wallets. This is because of there’s a vulnerability, then all these users are vulnerable at the same time. That’s not a healthy ecosystem of wallets.
@_date: 2019-10-21 17:14:17
No it can’t. You can ask for proof and verify it.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:04:07
Yeah this is what I don’t get either. There is no way this guy goes out of his way the way that he does if he’s a billionaire, to me that makes no sense. 
He’s not a billionaire, or has any substantial amount of money. He was a professor at a university, that’s not something that anyone would do under the guise of becoming very wealthy. Nothing against professors. 
What’s so funny about this is that we don’t need any judges of lawyers to settle it. Just ask the network.
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:11:13

This looks like and doesn't look like a scam. Can anyone find me a link from the HTC website to this website. The URL is htcexodus instead of htc.com/exodus or something like that, which to me looks sketchy as fuck. 
I was able to find articles by forbes and others but would like someone from the community to vouch for them. 
They mention that Elizabeth Stark is an advisor but I can't find any mention of exodus on her twitter or anywhere else. 
How can I make sure that this the real deal?
Also what is different from this versus an android phone with a lot of storage? Do they have a good secure element and really good networking? 
I already have a phone but this looks really interesting. Much more convenient than running a raspberry pie, but if they don't provide a way to install custom software then its less secure than a raspberry pi.
@_date: 2019-10-28 07:51:26

This is amazing, really. Especially since there is little involvement from a server you won't have to wait on a potentially bad network, these "wallet apps" would scale really well. Could probably get LP bluetooth to look for people to bring in as they get near you.
I wonder what a really good UI showing off all possible functionalities would look like. Probably cool as fuck.

Is this the quadriga guy? I’m out of the loop what happened?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:03:33
It is and it isn’t. This is bitcoin and there is nothing we can do to enforce goodwill unfortunately. 
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:44:30
No. Best they can do is double spend. Also they would have to do it secretly, which would not be easy, because if anyone found out it would cause the price to drop. 
They cannot for example rewrite history since there isn’t enough computing power. 
More over, is there any evidence that the government has 100% control over all of these miners? It’s plausible, but that too would need to get out. 
As the limits to how efficient these chips can be made bottoms out we will see Samsung and the like put these in dishwashers and water heaters that get bought all over the place. I could see tesla pairing this with their solar roofs and battery packs.
Is this good? No, it’s just another obstacle we have to solve.

I’m not talking about a hack. Just the off chance that some unforeseen bug enters the system either through malicious means or incompetence which greatly reduces trust in the actual system itself. It has a long way to go. Not to mention how social consensus behaves. Nobody knows how this system will work under conditions at scale. It’s never been tried I’m optimists myself but also a realist.

@_date: 2019-12-31 20:54:26
It for sure was. Micheal soft has done a great job at making a programming language that allows you to target all these platforms. I just find it funny that the most private wallet out there is written by a company that has done so much to undermine their privacy. 
It’s a great product which means that even those that don’t believe in privacy can still produce great products that are useful to us.

A phone is meant to be a laptop that fits in your pocket. Since it can do more things it can also be hacked in more ways. A trezor has a narrowly defined set of things that it can do therefore it can get hacked in fewer ways. 
I hope this makes it clear.

In Argentina, freelancers have to convert to pesos when you receive the payment and then if you want to save you can only do up to $200 per month.

So the whole point of bitcoin is for you to know without a doubt that you know what you own. Bitcoin works by being able to present the blockchain with a valid signature which allows you to transfer UTXOs (bitcoins) to another address (be that either one that you own or a new owner).
These custodial services while being great for inexperienced users, completely undermine the entire point of the project. 
You have all these users that have money on these exchanges which (apart from making money in case it goes up and then you sell) is exactly the same as what the US dollar or euro or stocks are. 
To make this clear I will provide an example. 
Let’s say I am the US government, and I say, “if you take this piece of paper then I promise you that if you come to me with it in the future I will give you back something else of equal value in return”. Of course this promise is pretty strong, the US has an entire nation and the rest of the world that believe in this story but it is still a promise made by people. For that reason it is a soft promise. 
Bitcoin on the other hand is a hard promise. It’s a computer system that runs an algorithm, this is very mechanical in nature which is different from people.
Hard promises like this are really hard. You have to take responsibility for your own funds, this includes owning your own private keys and using a node to validate incoming transactions. 
To some people this is asking too much (tech illiterate or those with cognitive disabilities) but hopefully we can make this step as frictionless as possible. Even if we remove all the friction you will still need to put the work up front to both be informed and use critical thinking to understand what is real and what is not. 
If you really want to reap all the benefits that Bitcoin has to offer, you have to learn how to do this. 
This is called investing in yourself. Similar to how if you learn how to drive you don’t need to ask someone to do it for you. 
TLDR if you don’t own the private keys, when you ask coinbase for your coins they have every right to say NO to you. This makes you a lesser user, its you that should be saying NO to others and not the other way around.
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:39:09
This is the way.
@_date: 2019-12-22 10:45:08
Lightning is meant to be a scale free network. So the more nodes the more bandwidth the more transactions.

I always wanted to play a stealth 2d platformer that’s about satoshi looking for his lost private keys. 
In the end he never finds them but along the way he makes the best friends he never had by learning to trust.

The devs shouldn’t even allow the software to run on W7.

It’s still taking advantage of people that don’t know any better. Whatever works I guess.

Wasabi on desktop, green on mobile and trezor or coldcard for hw. That’s it.
Edit: I see that you are also going to use it for work. I suggest you look into btcpayserver, it sounds like it’s a lot of work but if you get a raspiblitz or a mynode up and running it will make doing invoicing much better.

@_date: 2019-12-16 14:43:31
Even though I agree with you, there are still some caveats. I don't think I would call it low risk at this point. 
For example, how would you demonstrate that there isn't a bug. Or that a bug does not emerge at scale. 
We have to iterate, slowly and surely and demonstrate empirically that indeed bitcoin does work chip away at the risk. 
There is still a ton of work to do and acting like there isn't is holding back the movement.

Yeah they are but this is just the reality. There will be fraudsters and scammers. This was no different when the stock exchange was just starting up or during its run, thats why governments tried to put in regulation because people were getting burned. It's really unfortunate that those without the means to differentiate between fact and not fact are the most susceptible. I am not really sure how to stop it other than to call it out and promote content such as this. Also this guy does a great job I feel like he's doing what H3H3 does but with crypto. Just calling out the BS.

It does hurt to have a durable device, since it makes it more expensive to make. 
If you are really concerned with durability go out and buy a flat piece of 316 stainless steel and an engraver and engrave your private key.
You can also look into cryptosteel if you don't want to engrave on the steel yourself.

TCP/IP came well before OSI. OSI has the TCP parts but it also tries to define other parts of the stack which ends up being not very useful. Maybe TCP/IP versus OSI is not a good comparison. 
My point is that tcpip is still used because it was good enough early enough and switching to other standards was too costly. There were other standards but they didn’t catch on.

Didn’t jaxx have a technical problem lately? Also I’m pretty sure it’s a software wallet. 
Unless your a security expert you should buy a hardware wallet. Unless you own less than 100 or so.

Yeah I mean it’s nice and convenient for us small holders if we wanna upgrade our computers or buy a new gadget, but until that company can pay their suppliers in bitcoin it’s not really going to make a difference. Maybe accepting it from us would allow them to see that it’s okay to do transactions in bitcoin but that itself would need a regulatory framework which as far as I can see if very far off.

I still don’t understand how a large society can function without taxes. Who builds roads? Someone would have to out of their own pocket and others would freeload on it and probably ruin it. 
If bitcoin becomes mainstream taxes will disappear and a different mechanism for public funding would need to be implemented. I’m not sure what that would look like nor have I heard a good suggestion. (Don’t day ICO or crowdfunding, I don’t believe that would work)
In my opinion, this isn’t a bad thing. Cities and countries becoming smaller and fragmented would not be the worst thing ever. People who are like minded would pool together. The road to getting there is a lot different. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:24:39
Litecoin is very centralized and doesn’t have any tools that bitcoin doesn’t have to protect from this. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:58:12
It means cheaper transactions. This is because the transactions are smaller and therefore cost less.

True but the reward of breaking Bitcoins blockchain is far greater than any other cryptocurrency. Tx/s is important but not the most important. There are multiple dimensions on which scaling has to be proven and bitcoin so far is the most superior.
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:48:58

Satoshi is the author of the bitcoin white paper. He was a computer scientist that took together a bunch of ideas from the past (hash cash, SHA256 and p2p) and put them together to form what we now know as Bitcoin. 
Nobody knows who he is, maybe he is still alive and realizes/realized that Bitcoin couldn’t have a central authority. Maybe he doesn’t care. Maybe he is really sick (dementia or Alzheimer’s) or maybe he’s dead. However it should be noted that those million bitcoins have never moved. Nobody knows some people have said that they are satoshi nakamoto but so far they have not provided sufficient proof.
