The LCD display *only* ever displays the status screen (1st pic on [this page]( so regardless of whether you have an LCD, you will always need a different way to configure it AND to actually use it.  The default way to do this is to connect to it via SSH from another machine.  If you've used SSH before, you'll know that normally, you just get a command prompt - but raspiblitz is set up to run the menu (second pic) when you SSH in.  The menu has all the commands you need to both configure and use it.
If you go into the services menu option, you can enable Ride The Lightning (RTL) a web interface that you can access from any browser on any machine on the same network as the Pi.  RTL allows you to monitor the Pi (so you don't need the LCD) and use it (i.e. join nodes, create channels, add funds to your channel and, importantly, send and receive coins).  The only thing that RTL can't do that the menu can is some of the config.
If you plug a monitor into the HDMI port, you'll (slightly confusingly!) see a standard Raspian desktop.  Plug a mouse and keyboard in to and you'll be able to run a terminal window with the Raspiblitz menu and a browser with the RTL interface - all on the same Pi!

Have you tried raspiblitz:
I'm using this without the external screen and it's working fine.

The first time you boot, it shows you its IP address on the external screen so you can SSH into it.  If you don't have an external screen, you'll need to find the IP address some other way - maybe from your router's admin console or nmap on Linux, or wnetwatcher on Windows.  After you've SSH'd in, you'll see a menu - the first option ("INFO") shows the same screen as the external screen would show if you had one.  The only difference being that it won't update over SSH whereas the external screen does.  I don't feel this is really a problem - particularly if you enable the "RTL" web interface.

Yes, but at the moment, only minisclue amounts.  This is the easiest setup I know of:
