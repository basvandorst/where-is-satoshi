well don't waste your time if you think TransferWise sent the money and they said they have then they did. I would open another ticket with Bitstamp.

yeah i wasn't too keen on the idea of online generation. I actually downloaded one of those programs when i first read up about bitcoin but i don't think i ever got around to figuring out how it worked. Now I've made a small profit on my day trading (like - $70 lol) and I wan't to just put them on a shelf and forget about them.

My impression is that as new people around the world are finding out about bitcoin they load their money into it, as the price rises people who own 100's or 1000's are drip feeding them in and when they reach a nice high number selling a shit load of them. every time it drops it traps more money in bit coin... The only people benefiting are day traders (gamblers) the exchanges and the people who own a lot from pre boom times...
maybe this is obvious... but anyway my advice to people just hearing about bitcoin would be to avoid it like the plague

I did this and it went through smoothly. Are you sure you filled out the reference field properly? they may be asking for a copy so they can track it down on their end.

Well i've gone from $150 to $600 trading but now i'm just confused.
If i buy now at 820 the price may drop back to 650 hoverpoint... but then it may shoot up and rest at 1k...
As I don't really know much about currency trading none of the info i can find helps... its a blind roll of the dice.
no answers here...I will keep my dollar as i can't risk it.
