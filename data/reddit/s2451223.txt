QR code payments seem to work quite well from a usability persepective... I'm not sure that NFC is much of an improvement on that but maybe it could be if you used the NFC to publish the transaction rather than sending it over the phone's internet connection. It could be more reliable in areas that don't have great mobile signal coverage.

Basically when someone borrows bitcoins or spends borrowed bitcoins some proportion of those coins will end up back at the same bitcoin bank - it can then re-lend them again. This process allows for a chain of re-lending limited only by the bank's market share. This happens with dollar banks as well - infact there is no way to prevent it because the bank doesn't know if a deposit from a shop is really the same money that they lent to someone else. I suppose technically this isn't actually lending out more money than it has (in that it has the deposits) - but it can lend out more money than actually exists (in that the same money is being counted many times over).

I skimmed some of the posts, but I don't really get it. 
Transactions may move to some other network with less settlement in the blockchain but there will probably still be alot more transactions settled there than today.

Well the NFC reader would obviously have to publish the transaction for you.
I don't think scanning is a really big problem to be honest - but maybe NFC would be slightly easier.
