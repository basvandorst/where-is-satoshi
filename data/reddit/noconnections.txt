The person I'm replying to has been a redditor for one day and has linked to a site set up just to scam people out of money. This is a new scam that is common on reddit.
Here are examples:
Look for poor English writing, no replies, and a website that has a weird URL like " as shown above. Some other users will post links to their reddit profile which links to their own site.

Nope, that's a bootlegging scam from you.

Nah, that's a scam link.

⬆️��SCAM WARNING��⬆
This applies to stickers/shirts/mugs/posters/etc...
This t-shirt spam is becoming an issue on Reddit. Often the accounts posting the shirt, those asking for a link and those offering the link are all involved. Usually newer accounts, often all three are the same age and have very low karma.
There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.
The broken English nonsense descriptions are also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertently hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.
Be careful, friends!
