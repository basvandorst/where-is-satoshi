Everything is a bubble

some bubbles last longer than others
bitcoin is more solid than most other bubbles

No it can't. 
That's impossible.  
Because I would buy all of it before then.

It's a proven success that shows some stability, at least compared to the remaining crypto space.
High risk, high loss, high reward.  Low risk, low loss, low reward.

do you think big sell walls that disappear could be signs of long term growth?

there's nothing abnormal about what's happening
only to people who dislike mathematics
see:  time traveller who predicted prices several years ago.  he put it at 10k for right now.  simple log plots.  easy.  
time in market is better than timing in market
it all depends on whether you can afford it now, and whether you believe in the fundamentals

you could say the same about anyone who is successful
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:02:45
more publicity, private and institutional investors? which results both in more money in it, but higher transaction cost, both acting as counterbalances
this happened last weekend before christmas, after which it bounced up when markets opened again. 
nothing fundamental has changed from what i can see

How can you possibly distinguish the bear trap and the bull traps?

a month of change can hardly be considered a bubble
tell me it's a bubble if it drops below 5k

Fair enough
They filed so that they could list bitcoin as an exchange traded fund

XRP can't last.  Don't they effectively wipe and reinstate values at the end of every month?

When I "invest" in bitcoin, I'm invested in all of the people invested in bitcoin.  They generate new goods and services.  That's a lot more people, goods and services, than any company could hope to be.

Quantum computing will cause a lot more problems than with bitcoin.
At least with bitcoin you have the chance to revert back to a cached state.

Give it time.  If you aren't day trading, then you'll make it back more than enough by the end of this 2018.

cut out the middle man!  
I'll sell it to you at 19k and buy it back from you at 7k

you've probably followed bitcoin for years and understand its long term potential more than new blood

The NYSE is about to enter the bitcoin market.
People think I'm going to sell now because it's changed by 10% in a day?  Are they crazy?  The NYSE can only bring money into the market, and they have a lot more money than what we've seen already.  Expect much bigger cyclical booms and busts.  Hodl on tight, because this rollercoaster hasn't even started.

Too much inflation causes massive deflation, once the inflation bubble eventually bursts and people move to anything that actually holds value (aka "deflationary").

hodling is the only winning move against whales, if it's a market they want to manipulate
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:07:02
every buy and sell leaves money in the market and raises the price long term
too large of a gain in a short term is risky, because this past week is exactly what happens
regular booms and busts are great because they allow corrections for overvalued things.  this bust is fantastic
there are some things that I fear for that have only booms.  that's the real market to fear.

Bull traps look exactly like bear traps.

... don't other cryptos have their basis in Bitcoin tech?  That's not 0 utility.


That's still not 0 utility.  That's an argument for utility.  Bitcoin is as useful as an expensive bank.  The NYSE wasn't doing so bad from what I could tell.


No one uses anything inflationary as a long term currency.  See: gold.  The whole point of any currency is that it ultimately is somewhat deflationary due to its scarcity.  Any currency that is not scarce has no use as a currency, which is idiomatic.  The dollar's value and use is tied precisely to its scarcity.


Still, it's a bit better than our "tickle down" economics, that seem to be just as value rewarding for people at the top.  


Got any stats on that?
Many bitcoin hodlers are in it for the philosophical societal reasons.  It's also the reason that many groups pay people to shill against bitcoin - because it has potentially a much larger impact than sheer money.


Life is a gamble.  Everything you do is a gamble.  The difference with the slot machines is that the casino house is guaranteed to win with enough time.  With bitcoin?  We will solve the transaction problems.  Our general decentralized house will win with enough time.  
There may not be a free lunch, but lunches should be cheaper and cheaper to produce with increasing technology.  The only reason lunch continues to be so costly is that inflation counteracts technological improvements.

In Sep - Dec 2012, the price was relatively flat compared to the sharp upturn immediately in Jan 2013.
Same thing for 2016-2017.
For 2011 - 2012, the price rose after Christmas, but was mostly constant.
The transition from 2015-2016 looks pretty similar to what it looks like now, and although the price was mostly constant throughout the first half of 2016.

Because the floor was well below the 20k price, so big investors sold while the profit was high.
Christmas is a four day holiday, with lack of access.
Crypto may be taxed more as of 1 Jan, so big investors got out.  This scared new investors.
It might decrease another 20% short term, but you'll see massive gains early next year.  20k at the end of next year is the floor.
