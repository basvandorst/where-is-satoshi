Euros is what I use. They are not perfect. But the amount of bread and eggs I can buy with 10 euros doesn't change significantly. This is why people use it as a currency.

I think they do have common sense. It just happens they choose to be hypocrites and manipulators in order to get rich. Nothing new in human nature. BTC is a game, as poker is, and the money the winners get comes from losers wallet. OP is playing the game.

I'm for a virtual currency which is stable with transaction costs equal to zero, or nearly zero. This would help a lot for the internet I envision where digital content is mostly free and creators profit from individual voluntary donations.
But I don't like BTC for, mainly, two reasons: 1) it's deflationary and 2) it's a tradeable commodity.
Being deflationary means you may get a lot of value just keeping it. The BTC you are getting for 1 hour of work, will buy you 10 hours of work x time later. What is obviously great for you, is awful for the other who is getting later to the train. Then, for me, its unfair by definition.
Being a tradeable commodity means that it's price will fluctuate because of the people that look for profit by buying and selling, not using it as a currency.
Edit: Let's try to image the time when the global peak value of BTC is about being or it has been reached. Everyone is going to sell. No one will want to buy. The price will crash. At the end of the equation, some people will have won a lot (of dollars) and most of people will have lost much. It will also be awful for online businesses accepting BTC as payment. The cycle of buying could start again, but it will not be the same, the illusion of BTC will be over and only the short term profit seekers will play the game.

You are not getting any money until you sell.

Of course. But they don't claim that the stocks and commodities they speculate with, are the currency of the future.
