They better reset everything to zero.  They’ve completely fucked the goat on this.

In this analogy we are mindless zombies.

I put in an order at 3000.  It went through at 8000.  Now I can’t do anything.  My own fault, but now I’m about ready to bayonet somebody.

Market, but it was showing market price as 3k.

Yes market.  It seems to me that the system just wasn’t prepared for the volume of activity and was processing things in huge lagged chunks.  It crashed on me and then showed the order as placed at 8k, then showed 9.5k market value so I tried to bail as it was clear the whole thing was out of control.  The BTC market was processing orders with 2k gaps as well.  It’s pretty clear they weren’t prepared for this at all.  Seems it needs a reset, however that works.

I’m not claiming insider trading though it was shady as hell.  I’m pissed the whole system shit the bed, put through trades I didn’t want and then tied me to them like an anchor.  Now my money is locked in limbo and afaik I’m just going to get eviscerated tomorrow.

Lesson learned

Southern Poverty Law Center is a good one.
The WWF.
It would be cool if there were a student debt relief fund, seeing as relieved financial burden pays real dividends throughout society.

But only has value in being propped up.
