Can we keep this stuff in the Girls Gone Bitcoin subreddit? I'm really not interested in that, I just want to read articles and discussions about Bitcoin. There are other websites I go to when I want to see tits.

...I really don't see the point in this. My time is worth waaaay more than 0.00000000001 BTC per however-the-hell-long it takes to make that much.

Thanks, that was a great explanation and made a lot of sense.
I think that I'm going to treat this as a gamble and buy real soon now (my wife even said that she's not necessarily expecting to see the money again... she understands that it's pretty high risk).
However, I just used ~£40 worth of BTC to buy "miscellaneous goods", so have transferred another £40 to my MtGox account. I'll place a proper buy order for the entire £300 when that money reaches my account... although ideally I'd like the exchange rate to dip somewhere around $10.50. There was a weird jump in value today - not really sure what that's about...

Don't you mean pirateat40?

Exactly. I've just transferred £200 to MtGox, and my wife £100 (I'm taking care of it for her). From what I've read, I have at least some confidence in Bitcoin long-term... it's a definite gamble, but we can afford to lose that money, so if the price crashed down to basically nothing then it would be fricking annoying but wouldn't affect us in any real way.
On the other hand, if it keeps rising, we could double / triple / octuple our investment.
It's a pretty big risk, but it's exciting, and I have some faith in the long-term potential of Bitcoin.
The only problem now is when to place a buy order for BTC. The £300 is just sitting in my account. I've been watching the market over the past week or two (even have a MtGox price widget on my Android phone) and there never seems to be a good time to buy.
As this is an experiment and we're investing for the (potential, hopeful) long-term pay-off, perhaps just buying now would be wise. But the price has been so flat for the past few days that it's always tempting to wait for a bit of a dip...

Did some googling, but still not 100% clear on what you mean.
Given that this is a reasonably high-risk £300 experiment that we're half-expecting to lose and half-expecting to see some return on (and that we're going to do anyway) do you think that (a) it's a good idea, and (b) should we just buy now? Like I said, losing the money isn't that big a deal; we earn decent salaries and it wouldn't impact our ability to pay rent / but shiny things, etc.
Just seemed like an admittedly high-risk way of potentially making a lot of money (long-term).

I only discovered it a week or so ago after blockchain stopped accepting UK deposits. There's some pretty handy info on there!

I'm in the UK... what's wrong with sending money to Bitstamp via TransferWise? I started the process last night and the money should be with Bitstamp by tomorrow morning. The whole process couldn't have been simpler - I recommend that you look into it (you might want to start with [this post]( on @_date: 2013-04-13 11:12:14


No thank you.
