You're right, I hate that word.  The perverse euphonic nature of chortle is disconcerting.
And no, I actually read your whole comment, but I just mischaracterized it for the sake of my point.  It was a subtle nod to federal prosecutors, of which I am clearly biased against.  
Thanks for the detailed response though and for the line, *"Our judicial system is systemically unfair---it is a great friend to a very small demographic of persons".*  Nicely said.  
And, in the future, may I suggest "guffawed" in place of chortled.  Much better word.

Cato has long supported "free trade" as economic integration.
Johnson probably supports it because of Cato-related advisers.  
Whatever the TPP actually is, it is part of a bigger philosophy that is dangerous to free societies.  It's the opposite of Enlightenment era ideals.

None of that seems even remotely extravagant.  I suppose you should add 50% to the price for inflation.  But those prices except for the watch are pretty standard.
Also I know of a Morgan Stanley 1st Vice President that had a major newspaper write an article when he bought a luxury condo in a famous building.  It was just like a press release, so and so moving into this building.  All just for marketing purposes.

Sorry but if you "chortled" at the headline, you are pretty out of touch.  The general notion that federal prosecutions are often unfair is widely known.  And certainly, his sentencing is absurd.  Maybe he deserved 10-20 years in prison, but life?  For what?  Being a threat to the system?  We can't let him out because he could invent something even worse in the future?
And what's with the phrasing, "was pretty surprised at just how poorly the case was prosecuted".  Federal prosecutions are often punitive, egregious and unfair.  This is a surprise to you?
The basic fact is the corruption of the federal agents should had been included in the trial.  And likely their actions tainted the integrity of the entire case.  And the media attacks and un-prosecuted claims of murder for hires only served to color Ross in an unfair light.   
I personally know an individual who could have been nominated for the Secretary of Homeland Security.  And this person knowingly protected money launderers and drug dealers because he is currently working in the private sector. But his resume is extensive and he's a former high-level politician; everyone in DHS knows him and while I can't say he is a criminal, he is corrupt, unethical and willing to lie to protect his interests.
Human nature is universal, and if you don't think the corrupt federal agents, the non-corrupt ones, the judge, the prosecutor and everyone else was malicious and unfair in the prosecution...well I guess chortle on.

He seems to have reasonable analytical abilities but no sense of a concrete foundation.  It is an example of Relativism, where he can't make a judgement that the current financial system is flawed.  So instead of seeing Bitcoin's inherent structure as the solution, he sees Bitcoin as some feature improvement to modernize traditional financial systems.  
It's like a lawyer thinking of a way to win for his client.  There's no distinction of broader principles.  It's related to this belief that no man is wrong except that man who says he is right (i.e. anyone who makes a definitive statement).  So everything is relative to what is legal or ethical under nuanced terms.  
Maybe he really believes the modern banking system is the best way to provide financial services to customers, but I am guessing he has never thought about it "is it right" just this is how it is, and here's a problem I can try to solve.

One thing that an SVP said is if this guy brought a $100M trust to MS then they could loan money to the guy at 0.3% with all MS fees stripped out.
Then we could take the $100M loan and debt finance companies so their capitalization starts at $0 or negative. So if you loaned $10M to a hedge fund LLC algorithm or maybe a film fund, you could 10x your IRR because you aren't starting with $10M in equity you are starting with a $10M loan.
Also the trust and entities would be legally separate via this 0.3% money loan from Morgan Stanley.

Honestly, they are mostly incompetent idiots anyway.  As someone said, the further you get to the top, the less people there are.  Everyone just is concerned with making money for themselves.
Sure, you can piss off the wrong person and they can't try to get you on a technicality, but if you don't break the law, and you talk shit to them, they get scared.   
Most make 50k a year, with the mentality of being barely competent and the ethics to choose to work for the Federal Government.

Morgan Stanley tried to recruit me and all they talk about is how interest rates will be low forever because it allows them to make rich people richer with little or no risk.  
I know some of the top people there and they are simultaneously crazy, stupid, sociopathic, charming and involved in all kinds of criminal activity.  They didn't know but I secretly recorded a ton of the top MS executives talking about scams, coke and hookers.  The CEO James Gorman loves me.
My opinion is some of us should get jobs at R3.  Systemic changes is only possible by concealed intent and infiltrating the system.  It's easy; they are so dumb, selfish and greedy, and sex crazed, that even the most neophyte social engineer can play them like a fiddle.

All she had to do was be humble, or self-deprecating, instead of threatening to sue for slander and defamation.  
It's disappointing and I suppose obvious, that her mentality and facade of expertise are traits shared widely across prominent people in business and government.  
And instead of acknowledging their criticisms, and trying to improve, they just double down and as if they've embraced some "secret law of attraction" that compels them to be delusional.  
And yet there she is discussing the "blockchain" with the most powerful and influential financial person in the world.  It's amazing the world works at all.

I agree that in this situation it's uncalled for but people have personal responsibility to choose where they work.  So this common concept of diffused responsibility, "it's not my fault, I just work here" is something I think is a serious problem.  It creates a world of monolithic corporations and agencies that

There was motive and a way for the corrupt federal agents to stage it all.  Ross has to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  
What exactly is worse, a random research student from Austin parlays his interest in shrooms and libertarianism into an anonymous online marketplace for drugs, or two federal agents equipped with guns and the public trust, running around stealing hundreds of thousands in bitcoins, staging fake murders, extorting DPR, planning getaways and gobags, forming foreign companies etc etc.
Who is worse?  Who is more a threat to society?  Did DPR invent drug dealing?  Were Americans unable to get drugs before Silk Road?

When I was young and dumb (now just old and dumb), I thought about making an encryption algorithm that'd represent a file by a multiple of Pi.  Like if you had a 100MB file, and you found that 1.82250185 x Pi represented 10% of the bytes for example.  My engineer partner thought it was stupid.

From the White House, Charles Colson conspired to kill a famous investigatative reporter.  When Colson died, a lot of people praised him from Mitt Romney to Mitch McConnell, who said he was an "extraordinary man" who was tempted by "the seductions of power".
Unlike Ross, it is a fact admitted in court by Colson's co-conspirators that they discussed killing Jack Anderson.  They debated staging a mugging and dosing his steering wheel with LSD.  And Colson nor his co-conspirators were ever charged.
I think there is hope for Ross, who ironically like Colson, is doing great things in prison by teaching yoga etc.  Hell, Colson's White House assassination plot isn't even mentioned in his Wikipedia page.
George W. Bush gave Colson the President Medal of Freedom in 2008.  Does Ross have no such potential redemption?  There is no evidence Ross attempted or plotted to kill anyone.
The corrupt DEA and corrupt Secret Service agent, along with the politician Chris Tarbell, destroyed the entire case against Ross.  The prosecutor and Judge in his case should be indicted for some crime related to withholding evidence and malicious prosecution.

I know executives at Morgan Stanley that don't know what Bitcoin is.
People are so self-absorbed and delusional, all they care about is their own money.  Sure they have their little R3 project but it's not like people at wealth management firms think about bitcoin at all.  Maybe ibanks.
I never heard MS employees talk about the stock market either though.  They just salesmen for products that utilize inflation and keynesianism to make rich people richer with little or no risk.

One strategy is to empower the other 11 Federal Reserve district banks.  And pick the one who is affiliated with the "real" creator of the Federal Reserve, a Cherokee Indian, heir of-
That Federal Reserve Bank is partially owned by a bank that was ranked  in the nation after the financial crisis.
It is the same bank that Morgan Stanley uses for all their underlying transactions.  A bank populated by conservatives and monetarists skeptical of NYFed policy.

I was a witness to a money laundering scheme and all it involved was flying tens of millions of dollars in cash to a bank in BVI Tortola.  This was in 2004 so perhaps the laws have changed.
The money was from Ecuador (allegedly $400 million).  While the Ecuadorian "bankers" were meeting us in one room, in the lobby there was a photo of Bush and the firm's owner golfing together.
I don't know if Bush's friend knew about the details of the deal.  However, the person the bankers were pitching, my boss, spoke at the Economic Council of the White House and was good friends with the firm owner.
The deal never happened but my boss admitted that he knew it was cocaine money and told me had it closed, he would had given me $1 million in cash.
The firm's owner went on to be appointed by Bush and Obama.

Here's one possible example of the rich people getting the new money first, and thus get richer off sustained inflation and keynesian policies.
I had a SVP at a large weath management firm say that interest rates will always be low because it allows them to make money for rich people with little or no risk.  He said it in context with a $200 million fund of some sort that they had exclusive access to.  If a client had a big real estate property, they'd loan a few million at 1% interest for 10 years, roll it into some risk mitigated structure that guaranteed 6% or something, and they'd make 5% with almost no risk.
I can't remember the specifics but the general points are accurate.  This SVP made 600k a year and managed money for Keanu Reeves.  
And the CEO sits on the NY Federal Reserve board.  I don't understand how that's not a conflict of interest.

If you are referring to the Rothschilds, they don't even own any US banks or commercial banks, do they?  They are conservative, old wealth manager-types with seemingly more libertarian philosophies.  Aside from Jacob, none of them seem to be that bad.
They are generally apolitical unlike David Rockefeller.
