It’s crazy to think that I would walk past $100 bill usd and not pick it up. Must be same thought process as to why old people still pick up pennies. 
Gonna be funny when my grandkids are laughing at me for pulling the car over to jump out and pick up a $100

Friend someone and have them send you a box full for like $100. Shipping a box of paper can be expensive. 
Also on eBay add the word “brick” to your search

Thanks for the reply. I have a lot of homework to do before getting heavily invested in BTC

I've always wonder the tax aspect of bitcoin. If you cash out could you be tax on that full amount (I'm in US)
if you got audited would you have to prove that you put for example $4000 in it in your now cashing out 6000? Would you get taxed on the 6000 or the 2000 that you made since it increased?

I've never owned a big coin before but today I downloaded the Wallet and I now a own .2btc wonder how many other people like me out there today or this week

So you would have to prove where the initial $4,000 came from and that tax has already been paid on that amount?

$350? You think it will continue to drop to the $350 range within the next few months?
