@_date: 2013-12-04 13:17:19
you obviously dont know the SI system. the short-hand for Bitcoin is BTC, so mBTC make a whole lot more sense than mBC. does it being four letters really bother you that much?

There is an easy way, just go to coinbase.com to create an account and go through all their verifications which should take about a week, and he'll be able to buy up to 50BTC per day
