These are the gestures that remind me why we're all doing this in the first place.

If I remember correctly, "cryptocurrency exchange" wasn't even listed in the 2014 hype cycle report. I wonder why they chose to split it from just "cryptocurrencies," what they perceive the exact difference to be, and why specifically the "exchange" part is close to the slope of enlightenment.

That is demonstrably not true.

Actually you said what you meant, he just didn't understand

Thank you! This was a transaction sent to me, not one I sent. I usually whatever blockchain.info recommends at the moment.
Edit: Also, I just checked out your link, and it shows that although 20 s/b would cause a delay, that the delay should only have 6 blocks. Am I reading that correctly? It has been 99 blocks, it appears, as of now.

This could not possibly happen, and will never happen, when I am waiting for some coin to transfer to Circle for a sell.

Good Christ that is wrong

There's really no reason to believe that the market will crash worse than 2008 at all. Then=subprime mortgage implosion. Now=10 year bull market needs a break. Fundamentals fine, just simply can't go up forever.

Excellent! A thread that isn't a meme or hopelessly optimistic. 
I do expect accumulation and consolidation for that long, and I'm hoping to do $500 a month for as long as I can. So I suppose, depending on timing, we're at a max of 2btc and maybe a min of 1.5. Nothing special, but slow and steady without overstretching my finances.

People laughing at you is not enough to confirm buying time. Buying time is when you chastise yourself and people around you just feel bad for you.

JC not everything you disagree with is trolling. 
I swear this sub has got to be one of absolute most immature on the entire site, which I suppose isn't a shining beacon of maturity itself.

This post is sure to go over well! 
But for real, if you've lost anywhere near the 85% this year, you should absolutely be smart with the tax implications.

I have a perma-poor friend. I told him "you're poor because you are just drawn to it...like a gravity of sorts." Hurt his feelings but years later he keeps telling me how he never forgot that and how it's changed him.

Yes and no. He has a decent job (like 60k), but had 3 kids with a non-working mother, so...

Maybe don't be a sarcastic cocksucker.
