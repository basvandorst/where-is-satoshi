Well the question is how will anything based on sha 256 survive that?

This is misleading, although you will always have a Pareto distribution, war on poverty tunes the alpha

SHA 256 is an encryption protocol that bitcoin uses. It is not bitcoin

I hope you’d agree that there’s really no point to recording every single tiny transaction onto the blockchain every time I buy a coffee. The lightning network agrees but says that there still cannot be trust between the parties. So I need a way to be able to send money trustlessly —like the normal blockchain— but do it in a manner that doesn’t fill up the blockchain. Lightning adresses this by allowing people to move “spending money” much like a checking account. This is done by opening a payment channel and now only when I want to close the channel (spent all my checking account or want to withdraw it), only then do I have to include a transaction on the block.  This is lightning

Just get a Trezor

Okay but not everyone is fortunate enough to have their national currency be the USD?

Essentially its a trustless solution built on top of the bitcoin blockchain. On the lightning network everyone on it has their own blockchain(ledger of transactions) which like the main blockchain is trust-less (the reason why it is trust-less is a bit more complicated) but it hinges on the fact that the transactions can be confirmed by the main blockchain. So its a second layer that needs the bitcoin blockchain to operate properly.

Bitcoin is super popular in South Africa, our Amazon equivalent even accepts it. Shiatsu massage at the waterfront also accepts BTC.

Calm the fuck down, look around you in south africa, you really think this level of inequality was sustainable. Land reform is critical and expropriation without compensation was always legal (amendment will make the law explicit). Finally abandoned buildings in our CBDs of Jhb and Pta can be taken and put to good use.

This, bitcoin lightning network has more test net nodes than some alts (BCH) and 1000+ channels on main net (for the stupid/brave/brilliant) nobody else has layer 2....

Yeah, let the “dinosaur” which is the only crypto with a working layer 2 implementation die. Sell me your coins please.
