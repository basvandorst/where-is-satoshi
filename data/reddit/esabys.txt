I don't see why this is a big deal. Its just their investment branch. They offer products and their choosing not to offer cryptocurrency. You can still purchase with your bank account.

Not bad.. but pretty sure using it to snort cocaine wins every time.

No. This is wrong. The appeals on their decisions are commonly refused (thereby upheld). Of the appeals that ARE heard yes, like 80% are overturned. But thats like 0.1% of all cases.

The bitcoin community just needs to keep it's cool. Technology debates aside I see a lot of bitcoin cash supporters flaming bitcoin and personally insulting the dev team and that type of behavior doesn't attract users.

Same. Saw a post in r/btc that 90% of miners are going 2x so we should switch wallets now. Its pinned too. I don't answer to miners, and I don't understand how the people in r/btc are cool with a bunch of asic fabs in china controlling the chain. Fuck 2x!

Serious question. With limited supply can blockchains easily increase the granularity of transactions. I could see a future where the minimum is like $100 because thats that value of 1 satoshi
