Basically Arab prince you wants you to send your ssn so he can send you some cash. So I think it is legit.

It is bad customer service. It is awful it has awful trades, I mean when buying crypto they made me pay above market price, not a few dollars but like 2-3 whole percent. This happened when I first started out and did not now any better. Plus they lock your money and I wanted to switch money from coinbase to coinbase pro and it made me wait a month. I recommend using a different site but they have a good coinbase pro chart, awful trading, but I have coinbase pro just to look at the chart and use another site to buy, it is a good strategy cause I can’t tell you how many times I bought cause coinbase pro chart speed is better than my trading site. I feel like I am cheating sometimes cause of that but overall they suck at trades, seems like they place all their assets into tech for market but not on consumer satisfaction

To be honest bitcoin is the most volatile investment I ever made and it is mainly just a guess and check but there are many influencers that can be essential when determining price. For example when a large exchange implemented a staking service for a certain crypto that  crypto skyrocketed 50%. So to be honest information is key, and trends only come in handy in the short run.

Yeah that is true cause they don’t charge you as long as you transfer money from your bank account to their site but they limit moving it so it is not worth it since they locked up 10k of my hard earned money for a month cause they wanted to. So that is why I hate coinbase cause they want you to use that on their site which charges you a stupid amount of money to buy crypto, good user interface in my opinion but management and actual crypto advantages are nonexistent.

I think it depends on your exchange/bank.
