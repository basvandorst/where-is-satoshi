@_date: 2015-06-27 23:29:22
Me too. All in is not much though. I try to spend and rebuy in Bitcoin what I can. I still consider this a hobby for me more than anything though.

tip 1000 bits
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:40:11
What's good about it? Do you use it?
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:10:09
Old times, best times!
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:41:54
That's why I keep topping up. Make sellers see that people want to buy stuff with bitcoin while keeping my own bitcoin balance up.
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:27:17
It might as well be an alien language to me...
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:00:48
I don't know why you're being downvoted. Its a valid personal opinion
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:56:10
No thank you! I have plenty bits myself.
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:37:41
It feels a little bit like they are trying to convince each other... Still interesting though.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:05:34
Thanks a bunch for all the info! 1000 bits I use electrum as well (in combination with KeePass even) and a smaller amount on Copay on my phone as a hot wallet, but if I'm going to store larger amounts I want a little more security.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:26:52
I have done paper wallets, but always feel scared I somehow lose my bitcoins there. Like with the change addresses and everything. I am comfortable making smaller paper wallets, but larger amounts I wouldn't dare.

Student but in Europe so I don't have an .edu address... 
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:42:54
Yep. I have my account there and can confirm. Huge huge new at least in my world. 
Also for anyone who doesn't know, in the Netherlands you have a token system where you can do your online bank things and purchases from home. With this you can instantly buy bitcoins on several websites without any hassle. I am really curious and excited to see what they can do with this.
-edit- also in the article he mentions a safe environment, so probably they will do some security.
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:44:31
So please accept other countries money?
@_date: 2014-05-27 12:27:42
Okay so what if I invest 10 BTC, take a 1 BTC loss the first week, then win 1 the next. Do they take 0.1 BTC so I would be at 9,9? I am assuming yes. I guess it doesn't matter that much, but still. I have quite a few variance simulators and am well aware of the RNGesus effect. Profits seem to have stabilized the last few months though.
At this point it seems like a pretty safe bet if you keep your coins there for a bit. I guess I am trying for a month I am not selling all my coins in a (presumable) bubble anyway. Thanks a bunch for your help, big hug @_date: 2014-06-06 22:41:39
We can do that with the bitcoin protocol
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:54:02
That's why we have bitonic where you can buy as many as you want in one minute with almost no spread, especially if you buy at least 0.25 btc.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:05:05
lol I like you
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:17:16
I did exactly this recently. I don't have a lot of bitcoin, but I'm not going to spend or sell the last one anyway (for quite some time). Might as well make it work for me. Like I said before I played poker so I know some people can't resist gambling. Especially when Bitcoin is just like casino chips in a lot of ways. I gained 0.02 BTC from this and love it. I read around 200 pages of the original topic for just-dice and decided you can be trusted. Really hoping you don't let me down. Is there a point where you won't take any further investments? Also I want to say that not taking 10% when the investor loses money and making a new cost bases every week are very generous things to do. Sorry that this simple comment turned out like this, but I am very pleased with just-dice and wish I found it sooner.
@_date: 2014-08-18 12:00:19
So I recently made a blockchain account. I have 2FA with my email set up. Every time I login though, I get a second email after maybe 10 minutes of the first. Even if I have already logged out. Is this normal or should I never log in from this computer again?
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:14:20
Yeah I was confused too, I got it now I think (made my own calculator ;)
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:17:15
Haha moet elke keer denken aan die "rap". XD 
@_date: 2014-05-27 10:29:54
Wow I didn't know you could actually do it right from the site. It might be smart to invest some BTC I have for long term anyway. Given that the site is safe and secure. Very interesting thanks for the HU :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:50:38
You can even use this as an example maybe. Definitely worth it if they see it's used often.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:33:14
Thanks OP: I'll visit for sure!
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:08:21
Yes, true. It seems every time Andreas talks I become a little smarter. It's more informed rather than smarter of course, but that's how it feels.
@_date: 2014-06-27 10:05:05




This quote leads me to believe he is evenly as under qualified as unaware. I didn't lose any bitcoins because of this and I am still angry and frustrated.

That's a very good questions and one I didn't know myself, thanks! Have 200 bits @_date: 2014-07-05 14:23:37
Yes it is correct. Thanks for testing it out on me :D

Are you worried about the decline of the line at all?
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:00:51
You're right. It still sounds weird to me when rereading the article though. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 11:06:21
Can't you use localbitcoins? Otherwise come to the Netherlands where you can buy coins in a couple of seconds with just a banking account/card, of any age.
@_date: 2014-01-13 11:45:25
OP please answer this one. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:07:12
And this is why we love you Andreas, because you did better than anyone could have done with a week's worth of ~~presentation~~ preparation. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 23:23:21
100 kogels, 100 geweren?
@_date: 2014-01-19 00:35:50
Since no one answered I might as well. Basically the reason Mt Gox is so high is because the delay on the money is very long. So bitcoins are worth more. And that is the problem with most of the sites that have a high differential in price. So yes you could try it, but depending on the price fluctuations in the coming weeks or months, you might not make profit or lose money from it.
Basically it's better to put it all on black.

How can I secure a wallet.dat file? Or how can I secure an electrum wallet (and the words backup thing)?
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:03:49
Ah okay that is a very friendly deal to say the least. Guess I'm at the mercy of RNGesus for now :) Thanks again for your help.
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:27:54
Yeah it is. Though a popular show "De wereld draait door" first introduced it as "de bitcoin" and I think people still cling to that, especially in the media.
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:30:47
Tasted extra delicious 😋 
@_date: 2014-08-11 08:32:19
I think the problem was there are not a lot of uses for it. I used it sometimes for candy machines at school or parking in parking garages, but otherwise you can just as easily use your normal card. It had no benefits over a normal card.
   
Bitcoin has a lot of advantages over it although the user experience has similarities. I think it would definitely be interesting to do a full comparison though.
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:39:17
Easy and safe storage is the next step imo. Adoption is coming along, but also very important.
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:57:42
Yeah I'm actually mad, no matter how irrational that is... 
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:32:05
I've yet to try out selling btc there, but hoping I never have to tbh :D. Other way around is almost instant. I was so confused for a while when people on reddit say it's so hard but apparently the Netherlands is one of the easiest countries to get it.
@_date: 2014-06-24 08:47:46
Exactly. They have been more professional handling other peoples money than Full Tilt Poker and mtGox combined. Before I invested in just-dice I read the by that time 200 page long thread to check where and to who I was giving my BTC. They really made me confident with all their actions and it has held true.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:37:59
Also for international companies it seems like a hellofalotta easier/cheaper way to send money around than now.
@_date: 2014-09-11 16:50:50
Wow what a weird... "interview". They aren't wrong or misleading though. Very interesting to say the least.
@_date: 2014-05-26 13:20:20
Instead of 'luring' them with value, try convincing them with useability? I got my brother into it by just mentioning it when it came up in conversation. I do this everywhere. Of course when people complain about fees or delays or buyouts I take my chance. I try my best to explain the merits and dangers and answer any questions. If they are interested I help them set it up. I am no pro, but my brother wanted to use them to buy a VPN and I set him up with a starters guide and helped him through. He knows all he needs to know. He was very surprised at how easy it is and we trade bitcoin for small money we owe each other now. 
Also got some people at school interested. My success rate is about 1 in 6 or so, but I don't mind. I am excited for everything Bitcoin can do for us and the world. Also we're not building Rome in a day here ;)
In short I don't think the pushing is going to do it. Make them see the benefit and they will "convert".

Hi Essexal my name is feedabeast and I'm a panic buyer. Also I don't obey the rules and am more invested than I should.
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:53:12
That is not that surprising though. I bet a lot of smart high-ups who invest a bit have some amount at least. Diversify!
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:14:43
I hope he has an umbrella...
@_date: 2014-05-27 11:46:31
I am not too worried about the bust, but about the gains in comparison to the costs/fees. Say I invest 1BTC and the edge is 1%. They take 10% of your profit each week. So even if you average it out and "win" 0,9% each week that is going to take some time to really look good. And if there are only very small bets I don't know where the profits are going to go.  
I have a (successful) background in poker so I am well aware of risk calculation. That's why being part of the house edge seems so interesting :D Thanks for your concern though I do appreciate it. I would love to talk to some investors that have been around though.
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:26:36
Seems like a nice enough person actually.
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:45:35
Yes this made me realize I should take it offline. I have enough that I would be pretty pissed if I lost it.
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:03:18
Just as a feedback I think the beginning of the talk can be refined. You name Satoshi as a man and start off pretty fast. Maybe start off the talk a little slower, with a slower introduction. While listening I had some more small things, but I already can't remember them. At the end it really comes together. Just my two cents on the talk.
I'm a real big fan of your work for bitcoin and have listened to hours upon hours of you talking about bitcoin. I get more and more informed, but also excited every time. I couldn't imagine a better spokesman for bitcoin. Thanks so much for everything you do.
@_date: 2014-09-11 17:36:30
That is interesting it sounded very hostile to me. English is not my first language so it's extra weird for me.

I really hate how this "debate" is just the other guy saying bitcoin sucks because of this. Then he gets the best explanation ever which completely nullifies his "worries". And THEN HE MOVES ON TO ANOTHER POINT. This is a thing that dumb debaters always do (I saw the evolution debate) and it really grinds my gears. Makes it seem to the casual observer that doesn't know the about the subject or persons involved that they are on ever ground.
I can't word it very well, but this is really bothering me because I see it a lot, especially in bitcoin debate.

While this is awesome I know it won't be use for example in the Netherlands because we have bitonic when you can just pay with your bank in minutes. Good news though.
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:22:48
And that is exactly why they use chips :)

There are other options for revenue... This isn't black and white. Though I agree with you of course your point is solid. For example I know a website with technical users which has a support forum or something. Some users act as tech support and the site makes money from it. Good for all. I'm not saying this is an option for all sites, just that there are more options.
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:06:32

You should start to play poker, where this is an asset.
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:11:06
It's the thrill. Also people are generally not in the best state of mind when making these decisions. This is also very smart because just like casino chips some people don't consider the amount they are actually betting with BTC. I bet (haha) OP would have never gone 50/50 (-edit- 70/30, you get the point) with actually 32k of dollars in front of him. And that's the strength of the site. If I had any money to invest besides BTC I would definitely try making my own Bitcoin gambling site. So much potential.
@_date: 2014-06-07 07:07:15
Have 100 bits for the graph Also 10k+ rolls, wow that's dedication. Or did you use a bot?
@_date: 2014-06-08 10:54:23
A question if you don't mind: you are saying that if I lose and restore my wallet it is still protected by the same password I put on it? How is this saved if the wallet is lost? Can someone who finds my keyphrase steal my coins?
@_date: 2014-06-27 09:06:10
He has to live also. If I could I would do exactly the same as him. If people don't care to report it, I wouldn't care to give it back. However anything above say one btc might be an exception for me personally. 
Keep the lazy uneducated peoples money to make btc more safe for the uneducated.

Yes Steam is one of my great wishes for BTC. Or not because I would spend it all... Have 50 upvotes @_date: 2014-08-11 21:28:29
With paper wallets I am always so unsure what I can and can't do. With return addresses and such I am so scared to lose it all because of a stupid mistake... I guess that's just more reading up and testing though so you're right.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:26:55
Yes that is exactly my point. Preventing Bitcoin from being used for illegal activities is the lowest priority for the future of Bitcoin. It might not even be possible or we might not even want it to be possible.
I understand maybe he has to make a statement like this for the public perception, but to anyone who knows anything about Bitcoin or has critical thinking capabilities it just makes no sense at all. And it makes him look very dumb.
@_date: 2014-09-02 21:33:25
I spent some bitcoin money on Reddit Gold, food delivery (in my country one of the biggest fast food deliveries accepts bitcoin) and Humble Bundles. I always try buy back what I spend when I have money available. I also wanted to buy a tablet, but Newegg only sends Apple tablets in my country and that was not the best tablet for my use case.
@_date: 2014-01-13 07:55:28

@_date: 2014-09-11 16:54:53
Very different tone than the first "interview". He keeps calling Bitcoin "schemes".
@_date: 2014-06-08 10:29:30
So what can we non-miners do against it?
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:05:23
A bit is one millionth of a BTC. It is used for of several reasons, but mostly for ease of use. Also people had been saying they don't want to buy bitcoin because it is too expensive. So buying 100.000 bits is more appeasing than buying 0.1 BTC. It's easier if I want to buy something for a couple of bucks it's easier to say 4780 bits than 0.00478 BTC. 
  
When a Bitcoin was worth a dollar using bitcoins was more sensible, but now many people believe bits is easier with this price (and a most likely higher one in the future).
Also, try it for yourself 200 bits @_date: 2014-05-26 13:43:16
Haha bitcoin millionaire I see. I don't have the money, even my tips are small. But I believe :) Have 5 Schrute Bucks back @_date: 2014-11-16 16:02:54

Ah I didn't know, I feel like an idiot. Premium gift cards has no discounts as far as I'm aware.

Or alternatively buy steam credit with a bitcoin premium gift card. A little more roundabout but still.

Just buy the coins back that you spent?

I am not even aware of 20% if you're implying that I am getting a better price on the gift cards for posting this. I just think its a great service.

In the Netherlands we have a food ordering service that accepts bitcoin. I can just scan a QR code and it doesn't cost me anything extra like some payment methods. It's quick and easy and I love it. I can't wait till we are able to buy anything like this with Bitcoin. It feels so simple and amazing.

Is it me or are the questions always with at least a negative undertone (if not more). The guys says: "...the volatility *and all the other problems*" like there are no benefits. Not to mention the women who asks about drugs. Like you can't buy drugs with normal cash, only bitcoin. I've seen a couple episodes of this show and I might be a little biased here since I am very positive about bitcoin but it seems to me the questions are always negative. Luckily the guy is very honest and knowledgeable which makes the section very good.

1:18 I think they are referring to 1btc as if it was 1 dollar or euro. So in that sense 1btc being worth around 700 dollars now it is apparently the most. I agree its confusing at the very least if not worse. Also fully agree with the prediction point you make. I really think that should be taken out.
