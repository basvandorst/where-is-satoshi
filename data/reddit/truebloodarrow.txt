I've shared it on my fb, it's full of nocoiners.

I'd never sell out. But I don't feel comfortable getting into something not knowing the what ifs. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:54:57
Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:38:38
But even if the whole world adopts, tech is not there yet to absorb that amount of adoption. It's the balance imo.

Well I respect your opinion but I stand on mine, blockchain technology is huge and its going to have a very big impact on pur lives.

This is one of the best videos out there explaining bitcoin and blockchain. I was looking for something like this to share it with my nocoiner friends to let them know of the revolution. Although the emphasis on bitcoin's price and other blockchain projects is missing, I think you've or will cover it in the sequel video. So this is actually great job, keep it up.

And inthe other news, NYSE to open physically backed bitcoin futures.

Altcoins have bled badly in last few months and this may go on for one more month or so may be. So when the next bull run begins, which everyone is expecting to be late 2018 or early 2019, alts will rise faster than bitcoin. But we dont know if they have already bled enough as of now. Bitcoin seem to be stuck in the 6k-7k range for long and a break out looks to on horizon, although don't know which way. So make up your mind. 
Yes, there's a chance btc can go to 4k. But there's also a chance that bull run might start sooner than expected and btc might keep rising up like the last time. If I were at your place I'd buy around 6k knowing that the lower side is around 4k so if it hits that I'd be fine losing 300$ because it's a risk I signed up for. And honestly I lose money if I sell at 4k. If I just hodl through the bear market and bought at 6k, there's not much chance that I'd lose money. And do some research, try to find out if ltc and eth have bottomed. If you think they have then you should diversify into btc, ltc, eth or any other crypto of your choice. Personally, I'd buy ltc around $50.

A top 10 crypto turns out to be an outright scam, that should boost up the market confidence you think? And shorters only need a bad news to choke btc and this will be the worst news if people find out 10 billion dollars in the cmc is just air pumped into the market cap. You'll probably think people will rush to convert all tether to btc so that should push btc up but why would anyone sell their btc to tether that moment if they have time to cancel their sell orders. Btc will crash against real usd pairings. People would also use tusd/usdt pairings, instead of tethering out with btc/usdt, they will use btc/tusd and btc/dai to "tether out". It'll be chaos. Whales will be like "chaos is a ladder".

Kid is salty because he has seen people geeting rich in crypto and he didn't because he doesn't have the guts or brains to invest in crypto.
Don't worry there are millions like you.

How will it stop being money? As long as tgere are people who agree that bitcoin is 'money', it is money (it'll go down in value if there are very few people who agree its money, like it was a  few years ago, it'll go up in value if more and more people agree that it is a store of value, a few years from now). And same happened to fiat, I've seen pics of people taking a huge stack of notes to buy a bread in Zimbabwe ig during their economic crash, what words of govt helped the money hold its value? Govts words are what give fiat it's value, but when the economy crashes, those words don't help when the govt itself is unstable. 
But if bitcoin or any other decentralized crypto goes mainstream and let's say 50% of worlds population agrees it is money, something really really catastrophic has to happen for these many people to abandon it. 
I don't know if crypto can be stopped now, but if it's not stopped now then crypto will the future because once it has mass adaptation, it will stay because of decentralization, no one will be able to kill it.

Ok so I live in a hostel and my electricity cost is fixed no matter how much I use so do you think mining monero or any other currency(i don't think btc is minable on my laptop) on my Toshiba satellite i3 4th gen 6gb with built-in intel hd graphic card, will give me anything at all? I just have this old laptop that I don't use much and I wish I could make some money with it by minig.
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:45:25
51% attack isn't financially that profitable. You can only reverse your own transactions and you can't create extra bitcoin. Only thing it can do is paralyze the network, so if btc is fucked, crypto is double fucked and if that happens who gets fucked most? 
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:37:34
Imo If you want to trade, which you should only do when you've made enough research, you should do that on Binance, for me Binance is the best trading platform.
To keep track of prices, I'd say go for coinmarketcap, although it had a very rare glitch yesterday, they fixed it soon and it's one of the must haves. 
To keep track of events and happening, use coinmarketcal. They even have email notifications, so you dont have to check the website.
In crypto, you should be up to date with news, coindesk, ccn, cointelegraph, altcointoday, bitcoinist are the some websites I use. 
I'd say right now, it's better to stay in bitcoin before investing in other coins. First of all there are tons of projects out there trying to tackle different problems and are not competing with bitcoin except a few. So if you're interested in those projects, you should research about them in deep and try to understand the past price action, coins future before investing in them. So yeah bitcoin until you do good enough research about other coins. Also I feel bitcoin is the most safe investment. 
Finally you should follow some reputed YouTubers, good youtubers help understanding the crypto space easily. That's mostly how I learned apart from reading articles and blogs. 
Some of the YouTubers I follow are 
BitBoy and hodl
David hay
It's very important to stay away from shillers and toxic youtubers.
Sorry about the huge comment, I'm used to give a detailed answer, can't help that. 
Cheers.

May be there is a subtle relation if you are thinking in terms of price. Halving probably should shot the price up while tether blowing up will make the market crash (if other stable coins don't take over). Now it'll be interesting to see which one of these happens first

He gave me false hope and it got crushed when I checked the prices. I feel so bad.

Bull run when everything is going up. See the bitcoin or any major altcoin chart from 2017 to 2018.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:58:48
Come on, we've been seeing these types of huge green, red dildos a lot of time in past 3-4 months. This is nothing new. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 07:50:31
I think so, but I'm not invested in ltc personally. I think ltc is safer option but I like to tale some risks, I'm invested in other alts. Imo btc is the best option if you wanna play safe. And you should go into alts only after you have done enough research by yourself and I mean it. I lost about 70% because I didn't do that in my early days in crypto and listened to what others said. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:46:29
Duh, not even $50 in a month? Then I won't do it. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:49:22
Now I'm not sure if dai, tusd are really backed by usd or even digix is backed by real gold but I haven't heard anything negative about them either. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:41:45
He still is high, lol. 1 million btc is always welcome but it's much better to be realistic, all we can be confident about is bitcoin is going up. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:51:51
I don't see 'people' selling  its always huge 1min candles outta no where, it's someone with many btc selling. After that weak hands sell but those candles don't really stand out in front of the whales sells. They're surpeessing the price, etf, etf, etf. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:58:50
Remember what happened with etc cb listing? Everyone expected it to pump so it did not. Now everyone is just waiting for the inevitable ETF rejection so btc will fall, it might surprise again. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:53:01
Seems to me you timed it nicely, unlike me, lol. There still could be small downtrend for some more time, but if you look back after a year, there's a big chance that you'd be glad you chose this point to invest in. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:36:43
I've heard about utrusut, didn't know substratum is doing this. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:50:03
Then I'd rather sell that laptop and buy some etc with it, may be that will do better. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:08:14
Not really, I mean there was a moment when I was down 75% because I got fomoed and bought at almost the top and hodled. Now I do research by myself and analyze and trade and that's whyI've been able to cover a lot. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 07:38:16
Yeah man even when the whole world decides "screw you, dollar is useless, we won't accept dollars anymore.", you can still use it when you're out of toilet paper. Damn you bitcoin, dollar has such a great use case when it fails as a currency, while you're only meant to be used as a currency, a store of value and a  blockchain platform.
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:09:15
Again bro, **IF** tether blows up, market will crash and that too only  **IF** it is not replaced by any other stable coin at that time. That was my original view. I'm worried about tether because I haven't heard about the audits and I only hear FUDs about tether. I hope everything is right because I don't margin trade and I don't feel comfortable tethering out so market crash is the last thing I want. But I'd rather have the tether cloud cleared either it comes out completely legit or it turns out to be scam, either way I just want this whole tether scenario to be sorted out before the next bull run. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:42:58
In my country, coinbase doesn't provide services. Plus coinbase only offers very few coins and not for trading. But there's coinbase pro for trading but again very few coins and a lots of projects I'm interested in aren't there.
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:10:43
Why the hell are you posting old articls? Are you trying to spread fud or you're just that stupid? BTC is under 6k rn, needs to go up 33% to hit the 8k mark you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-08-01 09:06:58
What happened to that great wall of btc?��
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:48:44
Wth��. I can use faucets to earn more than that. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:48:15
See the problem we have with fiat is they just print it whenever they think it's necessary, it devalues the currency. Tether has the same issue, because it's (probably) not backed physically, they create tether outta thin air and push it into crypto market and there by Inflating the market cap. If this is true, it's very bad. They print tether whenever they want and fuck with btc and the entire market. I like the way you compared tether with fiat, that's exactly my point, bitcoin is trying to cure what is wrong with the fiat and tether is basically "digital fiat" if you will.
@_date: 2018-08-24 05:03:37
Sure, you're half way right. But will your D-coin have the same level of trust among the society? Will the mass accept it as a currency? Will it be secure, reliable? Other than that, how many people will know of D-coin in the early days? You tick all the boxes and add to that fast and zero transaction fees, it'll definitely be a contender. 
You think there aren't other coins out there doing that? A ton are out there trying the same most notably Nano and dash. But they still haven't taken over bitcoin and most probably not gonna do that in a decade or so. Because they tick all the boxes except one, the reliability, the trust among people. While nanao and dash are as genuine and as great anything can get but how do you explain that to billions of people. When it comes to crypto, they all trust bitcoin than any other coin out there. And **that's why your D-coin, the most limited supply coin with best tech ever, still won't surpass bitcoin in market cap**.
Bitcoin is the **gate** into cryptoverse.

I saw it in a youtube video by BitBoy and hodl. I forgot the name of the website, you can check his video if you're interested.

Already a currency doing that, digix.

Click on all the faucets available day and night, try get every airdrop that is going on, participate in Twitter, YT and Telegram giveaways, shill your ref links as much as possible, participate in bounties.... Then may be you'll get a fraction of BTC after exchanging everything you collected after spending months doing this. 
Best is to provide some kind of service in that extra time and accept BTC.

Dude I don't know about him/her but I definitely have 4X more BTC that what I would have if I just hodled. Some trades you win, some you don't but overall if you stop out of your losing trades early and know when to take profit on winning ones, you can make profit. Sure I'm not a pro trader but I'm quite happy with 4x more BTC in 7 months long trading. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:29:21
Highly doubt that is gonna happen but tbh who the hell knows. ��‍♂️
