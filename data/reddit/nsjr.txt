You have a Lambo and live on the streets eating trash at the same time, until you see your wallet.

When I bought, I checked ALL the time, about 60 times a day.
Now, maybe four or five... I hope one day I'll just forget to check =)

I think in the future we won't use bitcoin to do transactions. BTC will be like gold, you don't use to buy bread or netflix, you use as something to store your money that don't lose value.

There are no laws or money that can stop math. It's like gravity if you don't agree with it, you'll be f***ed

I bought at the wrong moment, then I bought now.
I'm really afraid of everything, but I'm feeling like a roller coaster.
Guys, can we hold our hands and let's have this fear of falling together, and if it goes up again, we celebrate?

After your third crash, you just go "MEH"

I think it will, the rise was too fast. Everytime that the price raised so much in short time, it fallen.
But, maybe it will fall to 8.5~9k, not THAT fall
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:30:30
Probably it will happen sooner or later, because the rise was too big in a short time.

Guys, not related to the topic, but how much is "small amouts" and "big amouts" for you?
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:51:38
Probably Bitcoin would work like gold, and other coins like LiteCoin will cover this day-to-day trades and stuff like that.

There's always a "this is the end of bitcoin, greatest crash in the history"
