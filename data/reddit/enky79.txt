Nah let’s be honest here. If we truly want to improve this industry we have to state things as they are. Honestly at this point the Banks are far more secure  than crypto exchanges. Trust me it really pains me to say this but you’ve got to admit. Look at QuadrigaCX, Cryptopia and many more just during this year alone. People lost their life savings during that kind of crap. We have to work very hard to improve this industry because to me it’s far from mass adoption.
P.S: I know I will get massively downvoted for this but the truth had to be said.

I’m so sorry for this dude. I heard that some people are getting ready to collectively sue that company? If that’s the case perhaps you can join them? Not sure but that’s what I heard.

You got lucky then

Well that makes me want to eat a sandwich. I like subway sandwiches by the way.

Then get the fuck out of here
@_date: 2019-02-05 05:57:35
Wait... do you actually think that Ver stole some of that money?
@_date: 2019-02-05 06:41:45
Can your grandma do it? If that’s not the case then we are far away from mass adoption.

I’m on board with you on this. It will be a good thing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:33:05
The best technology is by far BTC. They have better developers, it’s highly secure, it’s more decentralized, transaction fees are not that high anymore thanks to lightning network. Is it perfect regarding peer to peer cash system? No but it’s certainly improving and it will scale. I should also point out to you that if you want another peer to peer cash decentralized currency litecoin does everything BCH does, and better. And they have more transaction volume.

I definitely hope so :) .

Looks yummy!

If you want “security” ( whatever that means) and convenience choose Apple or Windows. If you want true freedom and creativity, chose Linux. Simple as that and no need to debate for 12 hours.
@_date: 2019-01-05 04:40:15
Woooow I’m impressed 
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:11:15
BCH is not even really decentralized. They use checkpoints and stuff. Plus it’s far from being secure if you compare to Bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:15:08
That’s why you should do a market cap ratio. It’s far more accurate 
@_date: 2019-01-18 19:42:08
Thank you! :)

It’s definitely a great country to visit

Yeah I agree with you that apple products are very durable ( can’t deny the facts).  And even speaking of durability, I could argue that an enthusiast could easily build a desktop station that could equally last for instance. But I see your point, Apple products are very durable and they have an excellent customer service. Also, their software is more stable than window OS for instance.  But if you look at the amount of profit that they make from their phones for instance, it’s from marketing essentially and pretty much very little innovation. Not to mention that miners that get the raw materials for all electronic equipments make pretty much nothing while apple makes insane profits. The other tech companies do this as well but apple is the company that has the most expensive products, again from pretty much only marketing at this point. Correct me if I’m wrong but I highly doubt that Steve Jobs would be happy with what the company is doing if he was still alive. At least during his time, Apple was definitely innovating and putting the customer first. Sure the products were still expensive, sure apple was definitely not open source but at least they were innovating.

If you think that Apple charges 20% more than they should on their product I hate to break it to you but at the very least you live in a bubble. Apple charges much more than that. At least 30-40% (and honestly I think that’s more) at this point. It’s actually insane that they can  just get away with that kind of practice.

How can you tell though? I think myself that we’re on for a long bear market but one thing that I’ve learned in crypto predictions is that you should never EVER predict something for certain to happen. Just saying
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:41:54
He’s right. Most people just look at cat pictures on the web
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:48:39
Yeah I agree with you. The only option at this point is the open source hardware movement.
