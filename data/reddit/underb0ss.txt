3. Linked an empty savings account. 
4. Move USD funds I want to use to buy crypto into the savings account and xfer to Coinbase USD wallet. 
5. Xfer USD from Coinbase to GDAX (Coinbase exchange) 
6. Place limit orders attempting to buy dips. (No fee on limit orders.
7. Move purchased BTC from GDAX to Coinbase BTC wallet. 
From there move it to wherever you feel safest hodling your BTC. ��

It’s ok to not be a believer. 
I understand the concept of “believe it when it see it.”
Those of us buying now aren’t doing it because we see the BTC acceptance utopia. We’re buying it in expectation that’s where it will be in x amount of time. Just like stocks with future earnings. That’s what the current price is based on. 
To put it simply, by the time you see what you need to for you to become a believer, I will likely be selling 25-50% of my position because “we made it.”

Bitcoin needs to be more stable before merchants will accept it as a form of payment. It is still in its infancy from that perspective. It’s also going to go a lot higher before it stabilizes.

Use Coinbase’s “Vaults” that have withdrawal delay and two email approval restrictions. That way you have time to react if something gets compromised. Use Google Authenticator based two factor authentication (do not use the one that texts you the number) on Coinbase and both email addresses. 
I wouldn’t keep it on GDAX. Read how the vaults work and then use them. The sacrifice you are making for protection is it takes 2 days to withdraw your coin from the vault into a normal Coinbase wallet where you can then do whatever with it.

Small piece of advice. 
“Ridiculous” is day trading crypto currencies with borrowed money and being sophisticated enough to build and run trading bots profitably but never bothering to read the IRS guide to taxation on crypto or asking for advice beforehand and keeping no logs or records of buys and exchanges.

Me too. I use Coinbase and GDAX and am very happy. This is an investment for me. If I start spending BTC I'll just move some to a local wallet. 
Honestly I wasn't willing to buy BTC until I could find a way I was comfortable enough with (yes, a little more like a bank) and Coinbase being a trust in NY and the integration with GDAX fit my needs perfect. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:38:39
I'm confident I'd f*ck it up as compared to Coinbase/GDAX and their cold storage. 
We should probably focus more on the security and processes of exchanges because if people are going to talk about BTC valuation being in the tens of thousands of dollars the barriers to entry need to be lower than printing your money and hiding it under the mattress. ��

Not sure I understand the logic here. The time difference between an instant market order on Coinbase and a thoughtfully executed limit order on GDAX is pretty short. (And you have more control)
Since transfers between Coinbase and GDAX are instant, I don’t understand why anyone would buy on Coinbase. 
The deposit time taking two days shouldn’t push anyone to pick a market order vs a limit order. 
The only limitation I can see is the daily funds move limit, which when I got mine increased I recall writing them on a Saturday and seeing it done the very next day. (Yes, I got a 24 hour weekend turnaround for something related to risk.) Try that with Citibank. ��

Get your USD cash into Coinbase however you’d like. Then xfer USD to GDAX. Buy BTC on GDAX with limit orders. Then xfer BTC to Coinbase.

Helpdesk: 
Have you tried rebooting your computer? How many times? 
OK can you turn off your computer? Great. 
Can you disconnect the power to your cable modem for me? OK now wait 15 secs. 
OK go ahead and plug it back in. Are all the lights green? Great. 
OK you can turn your computer back on now and try again. 
Did that work? If not I will need to escalate this ticket to level 2 and someone will need to get back to you.

Not so sure banks will all create their own coins. They'll want a heavily liquid blockchain based coin for their financial products and if each bank has their own coin it will greatly limit their ability to profit from trades, etc. They'll also be limiting their exposure to the market which isn't in their best interests.

Never not use GDAX to buy if you are using Coinbase.

Similar to complex password rule enforcement, 2FA should be a requirement imposed by the exchange. So I blame them. Customers will always be lazy and stupid. Simply blaming them makes the company less attractive to new customers because what else will be the “customers fault” when it happens.

Remember it’s not just merchants that accept BTC for payment that factors into intrinsic value. It’s the merchant’s ability to pay for goods to sell and their labor and utilities in BTC. If they can’t do that, they’re still converting their revenue into USD to cover their expenses. If they can’t convert to USD, they’re giving goods away for free. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:06:01

Customers with bitcoin balances stored on Coinbase at the time of the fork will have access to bitcoin on both blockchains. There is no action required from customers and bitcoin can be securely stored on Coinbase before, during, and after the fork.

This is exactly why I started buying BTC a few months ago for the first time. Bring in some of the big boys and they’ll help adoption along with merchants while jacking the price up to the moon with their “trading” activities. 
Don’t get me wrong, I firmly believe in the crypto currency concept and basically waited until I could use something “safer” for me like Coinbase to buy in rather than some sort of PayPal exchange. 
I have a little less than 10% of my overall portfolio in BTC. For me it’s an investment and this news makes me happy. Basically every bank has an R&amp;D team working on a blockchain product right now. The FOMO is huge. Because of that I BTFD and HODL like a champ. ��

A year or two from now banks and hedge funds will own fuck tons of blockchain based coins. They’ve shown a historic disregard for the small guy and basically laid the foundation for which BTC was born in through their actions and politics. 
Allowing individuals to easily mass the ability to vote based on how much $$$ they have you might as well call it US Government Coin.

Merchants would be invented to suggest people use BTC so their fees are lower. No different than those little signs that say "$20 minimum for credit card purchases" and gas stations that charge the same for debit as they do cash and then more for credit.

I don’t know about that. I think there is so much more adoption and adoption related stories by companies/banks to happen.

@_date: 2017-07-30 15:28:14
My gamble on BTC is it becoming more institutionalized eventually. Many major banks at this point have at least a research team trying to figure out how to build a BTC consumer product. They're dying to jump in. It's like Times Square in the 80's right now pre-Disney and ESPN. 
When you can use a blockchain based product to pay for a shitty gande latte in midtown and the funds come out of your Citibank account I'm going to start taking profits because we have arrived. 
I'm keeping my funds in Coinbase and buying/selling in GDAX because I have no interest in BCC speculation, I'm fully speculating on BTC and that's enough for me. 
I picked Coinbase because it offered me "enough" security to start investing in BTC.

I don't pretend to be an expert on this but what I see is a currency backed by a finite resource which is only now starting to truly be recognized in the mainstream and as it grows in popularity and perceived safety for the consumer, the demand will increase significantly for these units tied to a finite resource. The Coinbase recognition as a trust in NY was a big deal for me and I was unwilling to invest prior to that. We'll continue to see people like me, who are just starting to feel safe investing in this amazing concept now because it feels safer than it has in the past and the amount of information available on how to protect yourself is abundant and tied to mechanisms that don't make you feel like you're flagging yourself as a dark net drug buyer. 
The thought that we could start to see more retailers and service companies accept Bitcoin and ultimately, and this may be unpopular, banks actually start to allow the deposit, transfer, and trading of BTC is mind boggling. So much demand is left to be unlocked. 
I'm just starting  to look at buying at these levels after having sat with cash for the last few weeks. I'm sure I'll be terrible with my ultimate timing but I'm investing for the long haul with a small portion of my overall portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:39:43
But those countries can affect their currencies with interest rate and monetary policy. You can't print more BTC and put it in circulation at will and current state, you can't decide what the interest rate is for BTC. (Someday maybe if there is a bank deposit construct for BTC like you get for USD. That's above my pay grade) 
What measures does a country have to manipulate BTC other than perhaps changing their nations exchange rate to BTC through their own monetary policy kind of like how China competes with the US? 
In that case I suppose BTC is like the currency of the Internet if the Internet is a country. &lt;head explodes&gt;
