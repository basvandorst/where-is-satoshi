Well when the prize money disappears, he could share the private key for everyone to decrypt and read it. 
Or hash a message, with the private key as salt or seed (iunno). In any case, afterwards he could share that message with us and we could verify the hash by hashing it using the same private key.
The content of that message, being the details on how to decrypt this image, would allow us to decide whether or not it is viable and make some sort of estimation on whether or not it is rigged

I suggest someone scales all words to LogN by their frequency to check with all words.
z=5, z=8 and z=10 for example are not scaled to LogN, compared to other words that come that the same frequency

If anything, this should make the bitcoin price skyrocket. What we're seeing is merely a price adjustment from whatever bubble build-up there was. So, happy real bitcoin price day, and enjoy the price going up again soon!
