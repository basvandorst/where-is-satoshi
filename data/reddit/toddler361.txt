"Valve reached out to us because they were looking for a fast, international payment method for Steam users in emerging gaming markets in countries like India, China, and Brazil. While more users are coming online in in these countries, traditional payment options like credit cards often aren't available."
So they actually have good reasons to use Bitcoin, it's not just because it's cool and trendy.
@_date: 2016-04-27 21:00:15


It's not. If Bitcoin was like a central bank, then it would be a central bank whose policies are entirely decided and put in stone at day 0 and can never be changed later.
There is no one in power in Bitcoin because no one can force a change to the users (change = hard fork). If it was not the case then it would have no value and would not have a 7 billion dollars market cap.

This is the first time I see a clear attempt to sabotage Bitcoin from "The Powers That Be".

A spinoff is an altcoin which uses a snapshot of the Bitcoin Blockchain as it's initial distribution.
I thought it was a standard term, am I wrong ?
@_date: 2016-04-27 18:15:11
I agree 100%. Bitcoin is digital gold, it has to be robust and resistant to changes and mob psychology.
Besides, there is no such thing as a contentious hard fork. If it is contentious, then by definition some people will value the legacy consensus rules, therefore the old blockchain coins will retain some market value. Therefore it is not a hard fork but a spinoff : a new coin with the same distribution as the "old" coin.
@_date: 2016-04-24 23:21:04
The values are in the protocol, the code. Changing them requires a hard fork, but a contentious hard fork is impossible, as was demonstrated by the classic hard fork failure. So all in all, Bitcoin's future seems bright.
@_date: 2016-04-23 06:47:04

But how can a big mining farm be anonymous anyway ? 
Can the big infrastructures required really be hidden from a curious observer (like the state) ?

@_date: 2015-12-03 09:19:05
Yes ! I have been trying to explain something along these lines for ages. By the way, the solution appears to be a block size limit voted by miners in proportion to mining power as proposed by Jeff Garzik (BIP100)

But it means the Chinese Government can control Bitcoin if it ever wishes. Seems a bit at odd with "decentralization" to me.
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:53:55
In my opinion, the solution to all this mess, is to have a clear plan in case miners begin to abuse the system. 
Obviously it should be something like changing the POW algorithm, but my point is that this "emergency POW switching protocol" should be clarified and publicly known. It should also be made clear what kind of events would trigger the "EPS".
Formalizing such a plan would have two benefits : 
1/ Reassure investors about the dangers of mining centralization : we have a well thought backup plan.
2/ Deter miners from ever trying to do something "evil".
EDIT : What about a BIP666 ?
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:00:52
I don't know. For example they could jam the network by forcing all miners to mine empty blocks. They could decide to do that if they don't like Bitcoin, maybe because it helps to bypass Capital Control.

@_date: 2015-12-01 22:55:38
I'm not talking about the pools, I am talking about actual mining infrastructures. 
For example, the Chinese Government could create a "Chinese Pool" and force all Chinese mining farms to join it.

I don't believe your solution works. 
Bitcoin is based on everyone being allowed to mine, including aliens from Andromeda if they wish to. 
For example, miners from China could put their "longest/heaviest" blockchain on a USB drive, take a plane to Washington, connect to a peer in the USA and send him the blockchain. On what criteria could this blockchain be refused ?

If it is so obvious that the max blocksize must be raised now, then why is it that most core devs disagree ? Is it because they are stupid ?
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:12:41


Miners will mine whatever chain gives them the highest payoff, based on dificulty and price. Please note that the price bitcoin has in each chain already reflects the probability that it will succeed or die. So miners have absolutely no influence whatsoever on wich chain will win.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:04:32
In my opinion there is a free market but only in the space of all cryptocoins. blocksize limit affects the utility and value of bitcoin. if this value decreases it might make an altcoin a preferable choice for users.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:27:12
I believe there are more than 5 core devs and I think they mostly agree that things should not be rushed. It would be nice to have real numbers though. I think a useful thing to do would be to organise a poll among core devs on this issue. I know at least that Bram Cohen and Nick Szabo are not in favor of a rushed fork.
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:07:00
Who the f**** is downvoting this thread ? I believe it is a legitimate question. It is stupid to downvote everything that can be interpreted as criticism towards Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not perfect and it's success depends on the community not blindly believing that everything is perfect but rather trying to solve actual issues and improve the situation if possible. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:34:25
The contribution of fees to POW security in the case where there is no blocksize limit is exactly zero. This is because (as others have pointed) if there is not blocksize limit then "fees will trend toward the marginal cost of including a transaction".
So in my opinion, a blocksize limit will be needed when bitcoin inflation is no longer enough to secure the network.
Now would a blocksize limit that only allows for one transaction per block be optimal ? no because : 
1/ bigger blocks may allow larger fees in total
2/ very high fees may turn users to an altcoin (there is a fee competition between cryptocoins)
So there must be a soft spot in the middle between 0 and +infinity

But let's say transaction creators decide to mine themselves with 1% of total hashrate. It would mean they would have to wait 100 blocks on average to have their transaction included in one of their block, right ?
Also, the point of his argument is that they would not be mining profitably.

"Anytime there is a threat, then we abandon the current methods and shift to an other?"
No, I advocate to switch POW in case of **failure** : If the system no longer works properly, the way it was meant to work (Miners start to censor transactions, to do double spends, whatever...)
It is only a threat : we threaten to switch POW in case miners misbehave, so that they never misbehave. Look at it like nukes.

As long as they continue the attack, no transaction will be processed. 
The price of Bitcoin will plummet, making the attack less expensive.
Since only blocks processed by Chinese miners will contribute to the longest chain, it becomes unprofitable for anyone else to mine, making the attack even cheaper. 
It has been well known from the start that 51% attacks are pretty serious.

Actually 51% would be enough. They could mine for weeks to create a big edge and then release their blockchain.

@_date: 2015-12-01 18:43:01

I agree, but given the huge number of people who wrongly believe that miners somehow have a say about the protocol or are the same thing as the "economic majority" I think you should be extremely cautious when talking about mining when you are really talking about what the "leading" currency is. 
For example, I just saw this :

What is the purpose of Classic ? Not to increase the block size given that Core agrees for a 2MB increase as a softfork. The only explanation is that they want to take control of bitcoin development via a coup, implemented as a political and symbolic hardfork. As Bram Cohen joked about ( they could as well hard fork to 1MB + 1 byte, the result would be the same.
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:03:58

@_date: 2016-01-20 16:48:18
No agreement can be found given that the sole purpose of Classic is to fire Core developers. They are not even that interested in increasing the block size : All core developers agree for an increase but as a softfork, not hardfork. This is the real disagreement. Classic wants to hardfork Bitcoin in order to deligitimate the Core team and take control of Bitcoin. In my view, it is more a coup than anything else.
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:24:54
Very interesting comment. I believe you are right. The only solution would be to to make, at some point when the Bitcoin Protocol is mature, any hardfork or changes in the rules impossible. But is it only possible ? It seems it will always be possible to influence miners to "upgrade" to some new version, just like the Toomin team is doing, and force those who dont want these changes to make some "reactive" hardfork changing the POW or something else. These really are hard questions and I wonder if any one understands the whole picture or not.

100% wrong. It would be the case only if the fork was consensual, which it clearly is not. We will have two flavors of Bitcoin which will coexist, possibly for a very long time (years, decades, who knows)

@_date: 2016-01-25 18:53:20
Yes you are just explaining how Satoshi consensus works. It has nothing to do with hard forks and the current debate about classic. If there was a fork with 2MB blocks they would be considered invalid from the current Bitcoin protocol point of view. So your definition does not help you to define what would be the "leading" currency, unless you just say the leading currency would be the one with the highest market cap : once again, it has nothing to do with mining.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:40:24

"And as Satoshi declared, there's only one thing determining the outcome of the election: what code is producing the longest chain. That's how bitcoin's democracy works, right there."
Bit it doesn't work that way. The two chains can coexist even if one of them is much longer. 
When the fork happens, what you get is essentially two coins. The two coins will coexist as long as one's value doesn't get to zero. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 00:31:25
There will be two flavors of Bitcoin, with independent market prices. Just like there are thousand of altcoins. From the perspective of the legacy system (Bitcoin Core) the fork is a 51% attack from miners. The solution in this case is to change POW. Core is already taking steps in that direction in case the fork really happens (new POW proposed by lukejr).
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:38:32


This definition is somewhat circular : notice how you need to use the concept of "cryptocurrency with the highest value" in order to define the "leading cryptocurrency".
You are somehow trying to bring mining in the issue when it has nothing to do with mining. What you are saying is simply that the leading cryptocurrency is the cryptocurrency with the highest market cap : a tautology.
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:06:47


I absolutely agree with that.


I don't agree with that, however. We don't know currently, if the majority of bitcoin holders support Classic over Core. I certainly support Core and not Classic. I suspect the majority of smart money thinks the same, but there is only one way to know : Do the fork and see who rallies behind core or classic. If core coins happen to be worth 10% of classic coins, then it means you were right. In my opinion, the Classic coup will fail miserably though, so much that there will not even be a fork in the end. But we shall see.
@_date: 2016-01-29 00:48:57
As I said, POW would have to be changed, which is a good thing anyway given current centralization state. Hence miners will have no influence whatsoever. There will be a price equilibrium, just like there is for altcoins. I, for one, would buy a lotof  "Original" Bitcoins if they were worth 1/100 of what they are worth now. So cannot go to zero.

It is impossible to "ban" pools. Just like it is impossible to force miners (or mining pools) to enforce a specific transaction policy.

I agree, I would never switch to Classic and would stick to Core. If a change of POW was necessary, I would support it.

Well :) It is called the Sunk Costs Fallacy.


Let us assume that the miner has already decided whether to mine or not. We are at a point where he is currently mining a block. A new transaction arrives with a 1 satoshi fee attached to it. Should he include it in the block he is mining or not ? I see no reason why he should not.  He would just lose the opportunity to earn 1 additional satoshi. (All this is conditional to the fact that block propagation time is epsilon).
This really is the point we must come to agree on if we ever want to clear these things up.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:34:30

"The survey's respondents estimated that 90 percent of bitcoin by value is being held for speculation, not for commercial transactions."
These guys really have no clue. By definition, if you hold a currency, you are speculating. If you use it for commercial transactions, then you don't hold it anymore : you've spent it. So 100% of bitcoin value is being held for speculation, just like for any currency.
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:41:46


This is shocking. Especially given the fact that 1 satoshi could be made arbitrarily small in order to improve divisibility.


So the burden is now on the users to collectively put enough fees in aggregate. Once again we have a tragedy of the common issue. Although users as a whole have an incentive to pay high fees, a single user can (rationnaly should) free ride and only pay 1 satoshi and let all the other users collectively pay enough fees for the block to be mined. In any case, this model does not appear very resilient to me.

I am trying to stay focused because all this is a bit complicated. So I must first convince you that my proposition "If block propagation time was epsilon and there was no maximum block size cap, then the fee for one transaction would be 1 satoshi" is true. I believe it is a necessary step to convince you of the more general statement that fee pressure is indeed required.

Very interesting. By the way I watched your video on the subject, very good talk ! 
What do you think of my idea to consider the situation where individual miners have a negligible percentage of hashing power ? This way you don't have to argue about whether or not miners have a long term strategy or a short term strategy, because their individual actions have no influence on the market, so only selfish immediate performance matters. At least that is my reasoning.
@_date: 2015-11-13 10:03:32
Doesn't matter because if the market cap is higher more security is required.
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:26:31
I'm so happy, there is at least one person who agrees with me :) !
Let's keep in touch and try to convince the whole world we are right ! 
You may be interested in my last answer to a similar discussion 
What do you think the code devs think about this subject ?
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:25:53
So why do miners set minimum fees ? I argue that this is to compensate for the marginal cost of including a transaction. Otherwise they would in theory be willing to include any transaction that pays a fee, as small as the fee may be and as long as it is not zero. Collecting more fees is always better, right ?
@_date: 2015-11-13 09:56:37
This is not a Nash equilibrium if the limit is not enforced at the protocol level.
Besides, imposing a minimum fee is similar to imposing a block limit. Except the block limit is more elegant in my opinion (fees should float).
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:19:54
I think you are mostly right, but not quite. The question really is whether the mining community acts as a single entity or if it is subject to internal (selfish) market forces. Please look at  for a related discussion.
If the miners are like a single entity, then their policy may as well be enforced in the bitcoin protocol for clarity and to prevent the possibility of dissenters (or traitors) who would selfishly profit from the policy being followed by the miner community as a whole but not following it themselves.
One such policy could be to establish a minimum fee. It is exactly like Apple choosing the price at which it will sale it's iphone. Apple will choose the price which maximizes total reward because it can do so, being a monopoly.
Another policy could be to restrict the total number of transactions that can be included in one block and let users bid against each other. This would be like Apple organizing an auction for it's iphones. Please notice that in this case it may hurt Apple to produce too many iphones, even ignoring production costs, because their price depends on them being scarce.
These two possible policies are very similar. At least one of them must be established if we ever want transaction fees to not be zero or one satoshi.
My point is that if transactions have a zero or one satoshi price, they can never be sufficient for bitcoin security model in the future.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:50:41
Will have to think about it and read the wikipedia article :) Just too lazy to do it now.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:43:17
bitbombs is not me.
This is relevant because propagation times is the cause of the marginal cost of adding a transaction in a block. If this propagation time was zero, the marginal cost would be zero. In that case, with no fee pressure, transaction fees would be equal to one satoshi. Therefore the total fee reward would be equal to 1 satoshi * number of transactions. 
Do we at least agree on that last point ?
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:02:18
Sorry I agree my post was not clear, I'm just to lazy to explain it clearly. So first you must make the distinction between the maximum number of transactions allowed and the actual number of transactions that occur. I was talking about the maximum number, not the actual number (otherwise it doesn't make sense, I agree with you).
Second, you must make the distinction between the part of the fee that pays for the marginal cost of including the transaction in the block (which depends on the memory weight in kilobytes) and the part which comes from fee pressure.
I believe that only the second part contributes to the security, but this is not completely clear in my mind and I would have liked some clarification from more clever people about this point.
@_date: 2015-11-13 10:49:17
You are right, but this is becoming very tricky. The only reason why Antpool might use a minimum fee other than the marginal cost is because it has a very big percentage of the hashing power and can therefore influence the global fee market. If Bitcoin mining was truly decentralized, this effect would not exist.
EDIT : To be honest, I had not thought about the point you just made. So my proposition is not exactly true.
EDIT2 (new proposition) If block propagation time was epsilon AND there was no maximum block size cap AND every mining pool had epsilon hashing power percentage THEN the fee for one transaction would be 1 satoshi.
@_date: 2015-11-13 10:06:21
This is a coordination problem. Miners can not enforce a minimum fee because there will always be traitors who profit by accepting lower fees after all and betray the minimum fee limit.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:43:27
Yes, this is what I call the marginal cost of including the transaction in the block. Is that the correct terminology ?
@_date: 2015-11-14 14:57:35
OK :) 
I agree with everything you said.
But I just thought about a counter argument to my own argument : If an epsilon miner includes a transaction with a 1 satoshi fee, it is now included in the blockchain for everyone to see. Including other miners. And one miner could see it and think something like "Oh if other miners are doing it then why not me ?" And so the decision of the epsilon miner to include this transaction actually does influence the future, so my reasoning falls apart I guess. Or maybe not. Do you think the Nash equilibrium is still to include every transactions where "fee &gt; marginal cost" even when we take into account this possibility ? I'm a bit confused about whether or not it should take into account future events or not. I thought I understood the concept but now I am a bit confused to be honest :)
Anyway, thanks for the discussion. I will have a look at the bitcoin talk conversation and try to think about it.

@_date: 2015-11-14 14:33:56












I'm not sure I understand your logic here. These points are related to long term thinking right ? 
My point is that epsilon miners should not care about the long term because none of their actions can influence the future : their actions have no weight. When your actions do not influence the future, the best strategy is always the greedy strategy. 
So my point is that if epsilon miners are rational and try to maximize their total future expected earnings, they should include every transactions which have fees &gt; marginal cost. 
Off course one may argue that miners are not actually rational, and it may well be true, but I think it is nevertheless interesting to know what happens when miners behave rationally.
@_date: 2015-11-13 11:11:47
I agree with your point but what you are missing in my opinion is that miners are not a single entity. They can not collectively enforce a chosen policy because anyone can mine and choose to ignore the policy if it gives him an advantage : there can always be traitors.
The serious way to analyse this kind of situation is to use the concept of Nash equilibrium  The question then becomes : Given that a certain policy is used by all other miners, should one specific miner also follow this policy or should he be a "traitor". If the answer is yes, then the policy is not a Nash equilibrium and we can not expect miners to apply it.
EDIT : Also in your example, it is impossible to say whether the best price is $0.05 or $0.10. It is exactly the point I am trying to make : there is a sweet spot which is hard to know that maximizes total reward. Except in my post the sweet spot was about maximum block size and not minimum fees, but it is very similar.

They can limit their own block size but they can't force other miners to do the same. But it only works if every miners agree. This is not a Nash equilibrium because each miner should "betray" and decide to not enforce the limit after all. The only way is to enforce a limit at the protocol level.

So he basicaly thinks the people who invented Bitcoin are completely dumb, and doesnt ask himself : well this is strange, why would someone choose such a low number of currency units ? Maybe I should dig a little bit into this to see if I actually understand correctly.
2/ Even if 2,100 Trillion units was not enough, it could be changed. The author doesnt understand that the protocol can be changed if it needs to be.

This is a very good article. It has got all the facts rights, and it even explains that bitcoins are divisible : "Once a user wins a new bundle of Bitcoins he or she can divide them up in any way — up to eight decimal points — and distribute them to anyone else with a Bitcoin address".
A lot of people seem to be confused about bitcoin divisibility , so it is a good thing this article clears things up.
The only weak point may be that it doesn't explain the purpose of mining, which is to establish consensus about the ordering of transactions and thus prevent double spending.

@_date: 2015-11-13 01:36:35
Increasing transactions (EDIT Maximum Transaction Cap=block size) can either increase or decrease total fee reward, depending on where you are on the curve. There is a point where total fee reward is maximized. This point is neither at zero transactions (obviously) nor at infinity. It is somewhere between, at some sweet spot.
EDIT : I'm talking about the maximum number of transactions allowed, not the actual number. But obviously when there is fee pressure, the two numbers will be equals.
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:12:06
This is a good point.
If bitcoin transactions ever cost $1000 this will be a real issue for decentralisation and censorship resistance. On the other hand if this ever happens it will mean bitcoin is emmensely successfull and it will be a trivial matter to increase the blocksize limit at this point right ?

@_date: 2015-10-05 11:10:17
Of course ! If you cannot liquidate your bitcoin position, it is not a good store of value at all. You may as well have no bitcoin. But this is not what I mean when I talk about transactional utility : It is the ability to buy any goods with it, directly, with zero transaction cost and zero delay. Also there is a difference between the option to use it as a medium of exchange, wich is usefull but not nescessary, and the actual use by people as a medium of exchange. My point is that you dont care if one million people are using bitcoin as a medium of exchange, all that matters is wether this option is accessible to you : merchants accept it. Merchants accept it and people use it at merchants are two different concepts.
@_date: 2015-10-05 11:01:43
Well my point is that bitcoin use as a medium of exchange will NOT show up in the price. Other than that I agree with you, and it is good advertising if banks use it to transport fiat. This advertising might make some people aware of bitcoin, they might think it has potential to become the future world currency and buy some and hold it, wich will increase the price. But there is no direct link. If banks decided to use it secretely, it would have no impact at all, even if they used it to move billions of dollars per day. This is the point I wanted to make.

amost zero but not exactly zero. Let's say espsilon = 0.00000000000001s.


Don't understand what you mean by immediate.


It seems to be the nexus of our disagreement. The cost of mining has nothing to do with the story. When the miner must decide whether to include a transaction or not, his past decisions about buying mining equipment and so on are no longer relevant : they belong to the past. Rationally, his decision must only depend on future events, not on past events. I think this is related to what is called the drunken cost fallacy or something like that.
Faced with the decision to include a transaction or not, the miner should try (if he is rational) to maximize his future earning expectations. It seems to me that the best way to maximize his earnings at this point is to include as many transactions as he can, provided they have non zero fees. Once again, what he paid for mining equipment is no longer relevant at this point.
@_date: 2015-10-05 10:10:31
I obviously agree with your article. I would just like to add that bitcoin will not succeed because we will convince people to hold it or to use it. It will succeed because it will actualy be the best asset to store your wealth, so people will store their wealth in bitcoin because they are not stupid. If it is truly not a good store of value, because it might be shut down tomorow, because the government might regulate it, etc then people will not hold bitcoins because they are not stupid.

Price != Value
Value = the price bitcoin should have, not the price it currently has.
Besides, I'm talking about subjective probability, which depends on your understanding of economics, politics, psychology...
The objective probability of bitcoin success is either 0 or 1, because it certainly does not depends on random quantum fluctuations. Bitcoin has a fate, it's fate is to succeed or not. But I dont know what it's fate is, unfortunately, all I can do is guess.
@_date: 2015-10-12 08:53:26
Bitcoin was designed to be the ultimate store of value. The store of value that will destroy all other : $,€,gold,... This is no surprise then that what drives bitcoin adoption is greed and speculation. If bitcoin succeeds then all the people who invested early will be immensely rich, while those late to the game will lose a lot.

Actualy I completely agree that the ability to "liquidate" your bitcoins for "transactional money" (=dollars$) is part of it's store of value attractiveness. It is part of what I think is called "friction". A good store of value should have the lowest possible friction, if possible. However it is important to regognize what comes first. I view transactional utility like some grease wich helps increase it's store of value proposition. But if the store of value property is not there in the first place, adding some grease will not help. Think big, think about bitcoin becoming the new wold money. It will happen if and only if bitcoin replaces the dollar as the store of value everybody uses. And why would everybody use it ? simply because it would be the safest and the least subject to monetary dilution. Safeness of course includes the ability to liquidate your bitcoins for something else = to buy stuff directly or to exchange it to dollar and then to buy stuff with your dollars.
