Can I just say that you are probably my favorite person on the internet right now.

The fact that you are letting it bother you enough to post about it is sad. If it's such a scam and you sold all your bch, why do you even care? I just feel all these anti bch posts I see is people getting scared.

This post is 5 months old. I do use local bitcoins now by the way.

Honestly, the quickest way I've found is localbitcoins.com . I feel moneygram is cheaper also. But you search for a seller, read the trade rules for the person who has the best rate and history. The bitcoins go into escrow until they receive payment which usually is less than an hour then they release. Save your receipts just in case. 
 I have done trades in many different methods buying and selling and not one time had a trade not be completed. Reputation on there is everything so weigh that in before accepting a deal.

Bovada, a huge sports gambling website, just started accepting deposits and withdrawals via bitcoin. This just adds to the people interested in daily using bitcoin.

I'm lazy and hate going to other websites. Will this be something escrow and you release upon getting dropped off? Also hope there is tipping allowed.

Ya dude. Coinbase is a giant scam. They screwed me out of a bunch of money in a similar fashion. Cost me double the cost I expected to pay to cashout.
@_date: 2016-11-19 00:21:50
Coinbase sucks anyway. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:10:11
So your paypal isn't connected to a bank account? The problem is your going to be paying a lot more for your bitcoins because the seller is taking a huge risk.
@_date: 2016-12-16 05:30:51
Check out local bitcoins. I usually get fast cash by selling for chase quick pay. You can also deposit directly into their bank account. Coins get held in escrow until they confirm. Quick and easy

Stay away from the married guys. Your most likely not the first girl he's tried to cheat with. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 07:31:33
Just use localbitcoins.com , ends up being the same amount

You da real mvp

Dude, I'm telling you just don't even use Coinbase. It cost me 70 plus to get my money off. The sell price they display isn't the same as the actual sell price and they kind of hide how much they are taking from your money. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:33:01
I would say only cashout for monthly payments and keep as many btc as possible. How made would you be if in a year they are 2k a btc and you realise you just paid double.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:06:07
Why do you have to use PayPal ? Sellers don't like to use PayPal because you can dispute it after you get the bitcoins and get your money back. If you use local bitcoins just do like direct deposit to their ATM or like moneygram or similar. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 23:30:27
Coinbase charged me an extra 37.5 on top of the fee they were supposed to charge. To end up paying 80 bucks for my own money is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 18:57:11
Stay away from coinbase and circle. Just use local bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:16:56
Haha nice try
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:56:05
Ya I told him that after the fact. His account wasn't banned the coins just disappeared. Thanks for the heads-up though. I told him to go coinbase to wallet to acr.

Is there a way to donate directly to families in need?
@_date: 2016-09-23 11:21:28
Just send to 2girls1cup
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:32:29
Ya been 6 hours so far still pending
@_date: 2019-09-03 07:32:42
Support replied above, what's your response to that?
@_date: 2016-10-17 13:40:08
I've cashed out a few time on there no problem. I also used local bitcoins a bunch but I feel the fee is more most times.
@_date: 2016-10-15 12:55:44
I just emailed the email you posted. I also emailed coinbase support from the home page a few days ago and no response yet. I appreciate trying to get this squared away and trying to explain what I am doing wrong. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 12:58:14
Also that email just got returned supportreddit
@_date: 2016-10-17 13:39:14
Well ya, but it seemed cheaper than local bitcoins. What would you recommend?
@_date: 2016-07-19 04:35:29
Wow,  just wow.  I cant believe this is going down,  it sucks because all these people affected will most likely never trust bitcoin.  I hope this gets shut down before I see it on a 20/20 episode or something
