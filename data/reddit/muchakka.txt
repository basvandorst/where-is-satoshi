Only Case needs to be compromised. For example, a rogue employee can sneak in some code into the firmware that leaks the private key held on the device back to them over GSM. Sure, their firmware is open source, but how do you know what they have published is what your device is using.

Yes, but who does that recovery process go through? Seeing as Case has the other key, I would assume they are an important part of the process.

It is actually worse than that.  If Case goes out of business, your device becomes worthless.
- No more free GSM access (free is not free as Case is actually picking up the tab)
- No more fingerprint verification
- No more proprietary servers to broadcast transactions

Case can also freeze your funds by deactivating the device's SIM, and therefore the two remain keys that are available to use are theirs and Third Key Solutions.

First, my point is they tried to do it retro active by removing their newest code changes and added a license change to a previous tagged version. Looks a little shady.
Second, this is a bait an switch.  I bought my Trezor under the impression I could modify the firmware and then run my modified version on my device.  That is no longer the case under new license.

The commit says August.  I however have a checkout from september that is LGPLv3 so I am scratching my head when it happened..  Today or then.

You probably should consult with an attorney who knows software licensing, because I don't think a LGPL license can be retroactively changed.

Who initiates this "sweep transaction?"  If it is Case, then it doesn't matter who holds the third key.

Have you verified that Satoshilab's vendor ID is theirs and they are properly registered with usb.org? I ask because I was under the impression they weren't.

How does this 2FA actually work?  Can anyone explain the process of what is taking place behind the scenes?

How does my "remote device" get the transaction?  Is it having to to go through a server provided by Ledger? I ask because if Ledger company disappears does that mean my 2FA breaks?
