Ripple is very stable because the can dump millions of coins into the market at will. It's increasing, yes but by no means it is "mooning" 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:42:46
Agree. This post is plain wrong . When what the meme heaven nobody complained or discussed the underlying technology. Now it's time I guess 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:47:19
Tell me what tokens are those. Livecoinwatch has every single coin in red
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:46:51
Correct, but he is saying that his tokens are going to the moon at the moment. What is he talking about ?

The fact that technically bitcoin is falling behind its competitors is a fact , not fud. I hold btc among others 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:27:59
Technically bitcoin is bitting the dust . Better focus on the price because everything else now is behind its competitors 
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:44:59
I understand . But since it makes use of the www, I guess there could be a chance of filtering or banning by some authority

Can you please elaborate on the 51% attack ? I have seen it mentioned before and I'm not sure what it means 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:43:53
Im being honest here. Btc fees are higher , it's slower and I cannot see why it could be considered better than bch 
I also consider ethereum far superior that bitcoin in absolutely everything. 
Bitcoin btc  price pump is a reality but It still doesn't make sense to me. What makes you think otherwise ?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:55:11
Good answer . Interesting times ahead ...

Hahahaha !! Wow ! You are literally a keyboard warrior. The kind of shit person that never ever in his/her nerdy life have had the balls to talk to anybody like that in person. You are actually funny :D
Now, can you Elaborate on "Ethereum being a centralized curerncy" ? That makes no sense to me. Ethereum is not a curerncy, nor is centralized.  What do you mean keyboard warrior ?
I get your BCH shitcoin and greedy miner point, but you have to admit that from the scalability point of view, BTC urgently needs to change. And no, I dont mean to be used to buy coffe
Also, with all your Bitcoin millions, I strongly suggest to buy some oatmeal, or some other high-fibre breakfast and have a good shit man. 
In case you are an overweight nerd suffering from constipation, please accept my most sincere apology, keyboard warrior. And also spare my life if I ever meet you in person.

Can somebody explain me in which way is btc better than bch? What I find hard to explain is why btc is so popular 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:16:28
Agree with this , but ethereum can be the same and is already much more advanced  technically 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:14:26
Absolutely. And coming from ethereum that's something I miss from this community 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:00:41
Ok fatty you just convinced me.  Don't take life too seriously. I guess you take your food habits with the same passion and look where you are. Insulting people trying to have a conversation over the internet, assuming I dont own BTC, and dont know about Dao or Vitalik.
I honestly still believe you are funny. This is the image that comes to my mind
Get some more mac and cheese and fuck off
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:39:42


Are you serious keyboard warrior ? Assuming what you consider "blunt" and "direct" I must call you a fucking idiot. What the hell do you mean. Can you elaborate ? Eth is a platform, is decentralized and at  very leat the core developers are not at war like BTC are at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:21:36
The whole Cataluña independence movement is so full of shit you wouldn't believe it . 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:10:47
I argued with this guy some days before. To him Ethereum is centralized easily hackable shit owned by a Canadian. Bitcoin could do smart contracts but it is too busy trying LN and anyway nobody wants them. Crazy or too simple minded Bitcoin fanboy
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:58:28
I don't understand your "vastly disproportionate value of bitcoin " bit . Can you elaborate ?
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:09:50
Ethereum shitcoin? You must be kidding... 
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:09:41
I believe this is not true
