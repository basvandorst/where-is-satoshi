Ive sent hundreds of transactions with 0 fee and they all arrived within minutes. I think there is something fishy going on between major exchanges and the big mining pools tbh

If the US were to ban bitcoin you know how much USD value would flow to China? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:36:54


well there's a theoretical "tangible", limit to bitcoin's value right? the fact it has eight decimal places in code would suggest the highest it could go to be "used as a currency" would be 1 Cent = 0.00000001 bitcoin.
so $1.11 would be 0.00000111 bitcoin
1 bitcoin would therefore be worth $1,000,000
at this point, to exchange currency, you would **have to** use another crypto that is worth a lot lot less, to change smaller divisions of bitcoin. Especially for weaker currencies.
it could go above that, but you wouldn't be able to buy it with less than 1USD directly

Broaden btc advertising. Reddit is a horrible place to advertise, ive tried that approach and had 10 000+ hits from reddit but not a single sale from reddit. You will need to focus more on people that are looking to buy. Maybe add keywords like "buy xx" etc

Does the maths check out?
edit. math check:
Particle size. Milled Flour, 1 - 100µm (for ease lets say 50µm average)
lets assume these particles are spherical , but fit together like cubes with the same volume as the sphere for ease of calculation( it would give us an upper limit ):
(4pi*0.000050^3)/3 = 5.2359878e-13m^3 ( volume of one grain )
times number of possible addresses:
(5.2359878e-13)*(2^160) =7.6524047e+35m^3( volume of all the bitcoin addresses in particles of flour )
[Milky way Disk volume]( = 241 kpc^3 = 241*2.93799895e+58m^3 =7.0805775e+60m^3
255 Milky way galaxies = 255*7.0805775e+60m^3 = 1.8055473e+63m^3
difference 1.8055473e+63m^3-7.6524047e+35m^3 = 1.8055473e+63
so maybe a *little* bit exaggerated?
the flour would fill 0.0000000000000000000000108076% of one Milky way Galaxy

Just put some 5% in. If you stick most of your savings into a normal 5% intrest account if the value of your btc went to zero it woulnt be a loss. And tbh the risk to put in btc is less than the risk to never buy any btc
@_date: 2013-11-06 09:06:08
I think it's a matter of perspective. Fiats have inflation, so it's quite possible that it's the dollar that's unstable, and btc is more stable but you live in the dollar world so btc is shaking around from your side. If you lived in the btc world it would be the dollar shaking around

At some point its going to tip from popular to mainstream. That's going to be a couple of months of HUGE gains, plan to take a little out over that period as there will be a drop when that stops ( but will very quickly recover ) who knows but it could be from say 10k to 600k in a matter of days

Is btchin insulated when they're asleep?  The us exchanges are far more volatile and being 10-14hour delay the peak would be right? Eg when im trading between aud btc and usd the aud exchange is delayed by about 5 seconds, so it helps to watch usd for a dip, sell for aud etc

what's the number of people estimated to have investment in bitcoin today? and whats the total value of bitcoins in circulation? the price of bitcoin should theoretically skyrocket as more people jump on board, and also as long as states keep increasing their debt ceilings, the value of inflation of (example USD) will naturally increase the relative value of bit

@_date: 2013-12-02 16:07:56
How many users would you say there are today? 50 million? That's only =0.0071% of world population... but what about the world's **value** what's the worlds gdp? US$84.97 trillion in 2012 and the market cap in btc is $12.5 billion. If btc was to really become an international currency youd expect it to leach a bit out of every world currency and market. Lets say % 5 of world gdp = $4.25 trillion. So btc could be =339.88 times its current value bit why are we even talking market cap?  As a currency it has the potential to act as much more than a share in something, the value of world gdp would be traded in btc, =6,792 times current value, but gdp is balanced so it would be double, 12000. Then add inflation of all the other currencies then add ever increasing gdp and technically usd is not going to remain viable as a measure as it trends to 1btc = infinity usd as time approaches infinity

I have an app wallet on my phone, a live accessible "send to/ recieve" wallet in armoury running on my computer at home, and a secret offline paper wallet. The offline wallet holds about a third of funds, 4-5 nineths are spread around on exchanges/ p2p loans, shares etc and the rest is on my phone wallet and in armoury, so on my phone I have 0.16BTC right now, and I keep it around that number for easily day to day spending or moving money ( easy to scan qrcodes ).
When I want to put money in a safe place I send it to armoury from my phone, then send it from armoury to my offline wallet address
Edit : I actually have about 5 offline wallets, two wallets on app and three on armoury but simplified for clarity
