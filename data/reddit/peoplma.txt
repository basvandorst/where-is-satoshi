I know how transactions work.  My question is how will the bitcoin blockchain be able to tell the difference between sidechain coins originating from a subsidy and sidechain coins originating from a fee?  This seems like a pretty obvious attack vector, so I'm sure someone else has thought about it.
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:14:13
The whole security assumption of bitcoin is that miners won't perform an attack because they are financially *incentivized* by the block reward to behave honestly.  What financial incentive do the federated signers have to behave honestly?
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:32:09
If fees collected on the sidechain can be transferred back to bitcoin, then why not a block subsidy too?  From the perspective of bitcoin, fees are created out of thin air just as a block reward would be.

A model B will probably do somewhere in the range of 1MH/s and consumes about 3.5W under load.  So its efficiency is about 0.2857 MHs/W
In comparison, an Antminer S9 will do 14,000,000 MH/s and consumes 1375W.  An efficiency of 10,182 MHs/W.  About 35,600X more energy efficient than a raspberry pi.

I don't relay transactions below a threshold either (1101 satoshi/kB).  But if you make that number higher, spammers can then just move up to your new threshold.  When mempools are dropping all the lowest fee transactions, spammers only need to make their transactions the lowest fee ones to not have to pay for the bandwidth they are using since their transactions will be dropped.
Doubling the amount of transactions every 10 minutes does increase bandwidth requirements.  The question is, is bandwidth increased more if we have the extra blockspace to accommodate them or more if we don't?  Let's say we have 4000 transactions per 10min, and they are each 500 bytes, meaning they could fill up 2MB blocks.
With 2MB max block size, blocks are full, bandwidth requirements are double what they would be if we had 2000 transactions per 10min and 1MB blocks.
With 1MB max block size, 2000 transactions are incorporated into the block and 2000 sit in the mempool waiting for the next block.  Next 10 minute period, now we have 4000 new transactions and 2000 old ones.  2000 are incorated.  Next 10min, 4000 new transactions and 4000 old ones, 2000 are incorporated.  Next 10min, 4000 new transactions and 6000 old ones, 2000 are incorporated.  Next 10min... and so on. 
Now our mempools have 10,000 transactions backlogged in less than an hour.  Soon they will have to start dropping transactions.  Lowest fee ones prioritized for dropping.  If this is a spammer, now he's started using network bandwidth for free, his transactions will not be mined because they are dropped.  If these are real transactions, then the sender will be annoyed the transaction didn't go through and will have to start resending with a higher fee.  Now we are relaying the same transaction twice, redundantly.
It just continues to get worse from there.  When we have more transactions than the network can handle, attacker/spammers get to use your bandwidth for free, real people have to rebroadcast their transactions.  It gets exponentially worse.  After a day of 4000 transactions per 10min period, we now have over 250,000 transactions that have been dropped.  Many of them needing to be sent and resent multiple times.
The ever increasing backlog scenario would be completely catastrophic to node operators, bandwidth would not just double as in the case where we have big enough block space to accomadate 4000tx/block, it would increase exponentially for the duration of the attack.  As long as attacker/spammers keep their fees high enough to be relayed, but low enough to be dropped, they essentially get to use as much bandwidth of the network as they want for free.
What would happen then is fees would skyrocket well past the point of anyone actually being able to use bitcoin.  Some of the spammer's transactions would start confirming now that nobody is actually using bitcoin anymore and the spammer would stop to save money.  Fees would return to normal.  Then the spammer could start the chaos all over again.
If these 4000 transactions per 10min were real people trying to use bitcoin and not a spammer, well then fees would increase to the point where only half of the people who want to use bitcoin can use it.  And the other half just can't, so they go use dogecoin instead since it has much lower fees and 10X the block space as bitcoin.

Bitcoiners have convinced themselves there's a problem with scaling when there isn't.  Surely there is a maximum block size, but it certainly isn't 1MB every 10min.

block.io also requires a secure PIN to send funds.  You can log in to your account with your account password, but you cannot send any money or view the recovery seed, or do anything without the PIN, which acts as a second password.  So it's not really an attack vector, your PIN is what's needed and that you cannot recover (so don't lose it and choose a very secure long password for it, and obviously don't use the same thing as your login password.  If you do lose it though you can still use your recovery seed phrase to get access again).  As for identity, just use a throwaway email not tied to your identity, they are free to create.

It's a myth that increasing max block size makes it harder to run a full node, in fact the opposite is true.  Let's examine in detail.  There are 4 resources that full nodes require - hard disk, CPU, RAM and bandwidth.
**Hard disk**:  Increasing max block size could increase the rate at which hard disks fill up with the blockchain.  Pruning isn't really a large scale solution - can't have all nodes be pruned (or can we?)  Hard disk space is extremely cheap though and cost is decreasing every year - a $100 4TB hard drive today could store full 10MB blocks for 7.6 years.  Hard disk is not a limiting resource for nodes.
**CPU**:  Initial block chain verification takes a lot of CPU resources, but very little to continue operating.  Check points in the blockchain have been utilized already to decrease the amount of initial verification that needs to be done.  Additionally libsecp256k1 has been reported to decrease validation time by 7 fold.  Today's processors are more than capable of handling larger blocks, as tests while forking bitcoin testnet to 8MB max blocks have shown, as well as achieving 40tx/s on the dogecoin testnet.  CPU is not a limiting resource for nodes.
**RAM**:  During the spam attacks in late 2015 we saw about 10% of nodes get knocked out due to mempool backlog exponentially increasing required RAM.  RAM is a limiting resource.  Increasing the max block size will decrease the amount of RAM required by making mempool backlog events more rare and increasing the cost for a spammer to fill up blocks.  As a response to the spam attacks knocking out nodes with not enough RAM, the devs implemented mempool dropping of transactions - mempool management is now largely in the hands of users.  This solves the problem of nodes without enough RAM getting knocked out by backlogs, however comes with a tradoff, it introduces another problem:
**Bandwidth**:  Probably the most limiting resource for node operators.  Users with bandwidth caps are already not able to run a full node economically (fortunately very little of the developed world has bandwidth caps - Australia, the US and China being notable exceptions).  Increasing the max block size may seem on the surface to increase bandwidth requirements, but let's think about it deeper.  First there's block transmission.  Technologies available today such as thin blocks decrease the amount of bandwidth required for block propagation to close to 0, and other technologies in development (IBLTs) could do even better.  So block propagation bandwidth is a solved problem.  
Transaction relaying is what's left.  If we are frequently hitting the max block size limit, then those mempools fill up fast.  Nodes will be dropping those transactions.  Since mempool management is left up to the user, nodes will lose their mempool synchronization.  Now our thin block relay improvements are lessened.  Nodes that still have the transactions will periodically rebroadcast it to nodes that don't, resulting in redundant bandwidth.  A spam attacker gets to use bandwidth of the network for relaying their transactions that are ultimately dropped from mempools and therefore not mined, therefore no fee is paid for this bandwidth usage.  Further, legitimate transactions will be getting dropped too.  These will have to be resent by the sender (perhaps with RBF), resulting in more redundant bandwidth usage.  
So ironically, keeping the max block size low causes increased bandwidth usage of nodes in adversarial conditions (blocks being full either through spam or legit use) due to spammers not having to pay for the bandwidth they use from mempool dropping, or legit transactions getting redundantly rebroadcasted either by the sender or by nodes that didn't drop them to nodes that did.
**Conclusion**:  Increasing the max block size increases hard disk and CPU requirements, however these are not limiting resources for nodes.  Keeping max block size small and encountering backlogs more frequently requires more RAM and it requires more bandwidth - either from spammers or from legitimate usage - which are the two limiting resources to run a full node.

Empirical real-world data clearly shows that increasing block size *decreases* centralization of mining, not increases it.  Blocks are more than 4X larger now than they were 2.5 years ago, yet we've never been more decentralized than today in a post-ASIC mining world.

XT/BIP 101 proponent here, I'd be for it I think.  I just have a couple questions I haven't gotten an answer to yet regarding the soft-fork.  
Miners currently use part of the coinbase as an "extra nonce" field which is needed because the hashrate has exceeded the ability of 32 bits in the regular nonce field to ensure that miners aren't doing the same work multiple times.  The soft-fork proposal, as far as I understand, necessarily uses some of the coinbase field.  How much does it use, and will miners have enough left over for things like the extra nonce and casting votes (BIP 100 style)?
Also in regards to the soft-fork, to me a soft-fork implies that old nodes will still be able to validate transactions and blocks.  This restructuring seems to me that it changes how block data is structured to make validating blocks impossible for old nodes.  Unless I'm misunderstanding (which is likely) I don't see what a doing it as a soft-fork (instead of a hard fork) gains, or if it could really even be called a soft-fork since old nodes can't validate anymore.  Would non-upgraded nodes still be useful?

I don't think you'd be able to promote your new PoW algo altcoin in any of the major bitcoin forums though so I don't think that would succeed.  Besides, any other algo you switched to would be at least an order of magnitude cheaper to attack, scrypt is the next best one.  You are right that it would cost slightly over a billion dollars to obtain 51% of SHA 256, but it would cost only 50 million to obtain 51% of scrypt.  And even less moving to other algorithms.  Switching algos wouldn't stop a determined malicious attacker.

I wasn't trying to show a fee market, I was tying to show that unlimited max block size =\= 0 tx fee, that there is a cost associated with adding data to a block no matter the block size or the max block size.


Yeah, I hadn't anticipated that happening when I made up this little puzzle, I was surprised at that.  Nodes already don't relay transactions with less than 1000 satoshi fee, but maybe a protocol level minimum transaction fee would be worth talking about?  It won't be a problem for a very long time at least anyway.


That's true regardless of block size.  Block size isn't even a factor in the calculation.


Sorry, I don't think I understand.  No matter the block size the amount of data in a block should at least pay for the miners' increased risk of orphan that she takes by including the data.

My understanding is that's true only when they are traded for bitcoin.  When sidechaincoins are sent to sidechain addresses they generate sidechaincoin transaction fees.  They need to be merge mined (aka AuxPoW enabled) with bitcoin if they are to use bitcoin's miner base, and then the mining pools need to agree and reconfigure to mine them.  They are  almost completely separate blockchains save for the two-way peg.

To differentiate between an altcoin and a hard fork, why don't we call anything with the same genesis block a hard fork and anything with its own genesis block an altcoin.  Isn't that the unbiased definition?  What's the point of having two separate words if Fork=Altcoin?  This way feathercoin is more accurately described as a fork of litecoin, dogecoin 1.8 (AuxPoW) is a fork of dogecoin 1.7, and BIP 101 is more accurately described as a proposed fork of bitcoin.  And sidechains are more accurately described as altcoins.

Bitcoin sidechain, that's a misnomer.  A bitcoin sidechain is an altcoin.  It uses a different set of consensus rules, a different set of miners, a different set of nodes, a different blockchain.

This isn't discussed enough, imo.  If the price doesn't double at every halving then we'll lose more and more hashrate.  The machines won't just disappear though, they will still exist and probably be sold extremely cheap since they aren't profitable anymore.  ASIC development has flatlined recently, you can only do the SHA256 calculation so efficiently, and signs point to being close to that threshold so it's not a given that the machines of today will be completely obsolete years from now, especially with mining becoming less and less profitable.
The "supply will be halved so price will double" arguments are completely illogical and a myth.  Supply isn't halved because mined coins make up a very small percentage of market trading volume (2-4% currently, assuming 100% of mined coins are sold).
Litecoin is halving for the first time in about 12 days, will be interesting to see as a proxy for what's in store for bitcoin next year.  Dogecoin completed its halving cycle already, it ran into hashrate trouble following the 3rd halving and fixed the problem with AuxPoW prior to the 4th halving.
The 51% attack is real, and the only way it goes away is by price continually increasing (doubling every 4 years) or ASICs continually pumping out more and more hashes per watt (doubling efficiency every 4 years).  Neither of those things seem very likely.

At current transaction fees of about $0.02 for 250 bytes of data bitcoin is probably the most expensive storage in the world.  It would cost $8 million to store 100GB of data on the blockchain at current fee rates.  By contrast Google drive offers 100GB of storage for $24 per year, or a 4TB hard drive will run you about $100.  Greg's concern is completely unfounded.
Also, even if we had 100MB blocks, it would take at least 1000 blocks or 1 week to upload all that data.

Miners are hashing the header of the next block.  The header contains many things, a timestamp, a hash of all the transactions in the block, a hash of the previous block, version number of the software, and the current target difficulty.  None of those things change very quickly, so at the rate of millions of hashes per second miners would just be hashing the same data over and over again and get the same result each time.  So the header also includes a nonce (number used once) which is a random 32 bit string that the miner inserts into the header so that they are not hashing the same data over and over again.  That said, I don't see how a nonce could be "unknown" or "not match any other hardware".  That doesn't make any sense.

I like the 5 tradoffs, decentralized, secure, fast, cheap and unlimited.  What's certain to me is that a fee market will destroy fast, cheap and unlimited, not to mention the average user's experience.  I'm not so certain increasing the max block size will destroy decentralized and secure.  
First of all, by any metric bitcoin is already the most decentralized and most secure form of payment that exists in the world.  It is beaten today in the fast/cheap/unlimited categories by a number of competitors.  But I don't think a sacrifice is needed.  Perhaps in the coming years the castle's military will have have invented catapults, armor and cannons (more bandwidth, cheaper storage, more RAM, faster CPUs) to keep the large castle just as secure as before while employing fewer soldiers.  
The cost to miners for large blocks can be made up without a fee market if we have full ~32-40MB blocks by halving number 4 (2024) with today's average transaction fee.  We don't need a fee market to subsidize miners if we have that kind of transaction volume (which is admittedly a big if).  He mentions dogecoin's problems, and it was by halving number 4 that dogecoin was anticipating a large drop in hashrate and loss of security, Charlie's suggestion of AuxPoW was implemented with about a month left before that happened.  And he's right that the unrelenting halvings will be catastrophic to miners and to bitcoin without an increase in fee revenue.  That is absolutely essential.  But the main scaling solution, the lightning network, takes fees away from miners by moving transactions off-chain.  So I don't think that is viable.

Well, BIP 101 would be compatible with current SPV wallets, but it doesn't get the label of "soft-fork" because old nodes would find big blocks to be invalid.  Wouldn't old nodes be unable to validate most if not all transactions contained in Segwit blocks and if so how is this a soft-fork?

The idea of a spam transaction is nonsense.  There are objectively only two types of transactions, those which miners confirm and those that they don't confirm.  Any other definition is completely subjective.  By keeping block size low we would be necessarily increasing the number of unconfirmed transactions.  If unconfirmed transactions are what they are defining as spam then they are increasing spam by keeping block size low, not decreasing it.  If they are defining transactions that get  confirmed as spam and excluding those then they are taking away miners' rights to tx fees they deem worthy to include and therefore acting both as a censor and increasing centralization pressure through decreased revenue.

There's a multicoin wallet app on android called coinomi which has built in exchange using shapeshift's API within the app.  I suspect that's the real reason they went with iOS first, because android already has the functionality through coinomi, it's just built by a third party instead of official shapeshift

You mean as halvings continue?  The year is 2140, the last satoshi was just mined (the miner, Bank of America, pointed the coinbase tx at [12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX]( in Satoshi's honor).  The maximum block size cap had long since been removed over 100 years ago.  Over 16 billion bitcoin transactions are made every day, 200,000 transactions per second.  Blocks are 60GB on average, but 100Gbps internet is commonplace so they take less than 5 sec for miners to relay.  Orphan risk is therefore 5 / 600 = 0.83%.  
What's catastrophic about this?
Miners and nodes need to make sure they have enough bandwidth, that's all.

This is the crux of the debate, imo.  One side wants bitcoin to be about payments and the other a settlement layer or a store of wealth.

That might be why they are so against BIP 101, for personal rather than technical reasons.  In the thread you mentioned they said they could do 5MB blocks, but now it seems they've changed their mind and can do only 2MB blocks.
For reference, [here's the actual quote you are referring to](
Chun Wang to Mike:


suffered from orphans a lot when we started in 2013. It is now your
turn. If Western miners do not find a China-based VPN into China, or
if Western pools do not manage to improve their connectivity to China,
or run a node in China, it would be them to have higher orphans, not
us. Because we have 50%+.
Mike to Chun Wang:


trusted node outside of the country because the bandwidth requirements are
too high? Or due to some other problem?


ahead. Let us assume that almost all exchanges, payment processors and
other businesses go with larger blocks, but Chinese miners do not.


and cannot be sold. Your losses will be much larger than from orphans.


hashrate. SPV clients would need a forced checkpoint, which would be messy
and undesirable, but it's technically feasible. The smaller side of the
chain would cease to exist from the perspective of people actually trading


handle one or two megabits out of the country then you're hanging on by
your fingernails anyway: your connection to the main internet could become
completely unusable at any time. If that's really the case, it seems to me
that Chinese Bitcoin is unsustainable and what you really need is a
China-specific alt coin that can run entirely within the Chinese internet.

Mycelium will let you spend unconfirmed transactions, but it will give a warning that you are about to do it (a good opportunity for you to briefly explain about confirmations to the customer).  I don't have iOS so not sure about breadwallet.  
You the business owner are taking a risk here though by accepting their unconfirmed transaction.  If a malleability attack is going on at the time (which has happened a few times over the past several months) there's a decent chance that the funds you sent the customer, once confirmed, will have a different transaction ID - which would invalidate the transaction that they sent you.  Customer would get their beer and their bitcoin.  This problem has been mitigated with a recent update to nodes, but not all of them have updated.

It wouldn't be too hard to include electricity cost.  In the final step of the spreadsheet I calculated the expected annual revenue of the three miners.  All it would take to convert revenue to profitability is to subtract costs.  So it would be something like revenue - electricity cost - bandwidth cost - labor = profitability.  If you have a profile of those costs for each region it could be done easily.  In my example, if the high bandwidth miner is in America and the medium and low bandwidth miners are in China, then we apply a different cost subtraction to the annual revenue to find which is most profitable.

Yeah, if those factors are known they can be incorporated into this model.  Even if they aren't known you could model a range of likely conditions.  In this I just focused on a simplistic model but those factors could all be added for increased complexity and realism
Edit:  For example the term n((s/b)y) represents the the time it takes to propagate a block to y peers.  If we have 3 miners with known bandwidth to each other, we can separate that equation into n(s/b)+n(s/b') where b and b' are the bandwidth that miner 1 has to miner 2 and 3.  Further if the latency is known it becomes (n(s/b)+*l*)+(n(s/b')+*l'*) where *l* and *l'* are the latency of miner 1 to miners 2 and 3

@_date: 2015-12-16 05:51:27
I do think we will see massive centralization of mining in the coming years (halving 3, 4, 5) due to loss of revenue.  As less and less money is there to be made, only the most profitable operations will remain, it's inevitable.  This will happen no matter the block size.  A price doubling every 4 years could mitigate it but we certainly can't depend on that happening.  The only sustainable solution is to increase transaction fee revenue which necessarily means much higher adoption.  Whether it's through a fee market or larger blocks with today's fees, substantially increased adoption must happen to subsidize miners in the coming years.  I believe a fee market would hinder adoption due to a poor user experience and I believe the lightning network will take fees away from miners.  So big blocks is what I support.

I was meaning to post something similar, excellent points.  The word market is not correct.  A market implies an open and transparent list of buyers and sellers, what the fee market is is random guessing at what might get confirmed with a terrible user experience if you guess wrong.
That's not the only deceptive wording used.  Sidechains are in fact auxpow enabled altcoins with their value pegged to bitcoin (and should be banned from this subreddit under the no altcoin rule).  Replace by fee is actually kill all 0-conf (although opt-in isn't as bad).  Lightning network implies speed, but a malicious hub could just refuse your transaction, or worse, delay it for days (or whatever value of CLTV is used).  And a large MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is frequently equated to a large block size, even though 6 years of bitcoin have shown they are not the same.

Ridiculous fees are only a small part of the problem.  If we have a continuous backlog of transactions then some cannot and will not get confirmed.  Those who pay higher fees will.  This means that bitcoin will not be for anyone and everyone but only for the rich, for whoever can or will pay the most money to use the blockchain.  "Just pay a larger fee" I hear you say.  That doesn't solve anything.  That is the problem.  And core's direction of replace by fee and ejecting transactions from the mempool that pay too little fee is even worse.  Altcoins can and will pick up the slack.  Just like how freeware clones of popular services and software replace the paid versions every day.

Why must we assume they are acting on their own self interest in the future if they aren't today?  I thought we had established that miners (especially big ones) have no incentive to harm the network.  The entirety of bitcoin's security is its incentive model.  It's what makes bitcoin work.  If we start with the assumption that players act irrationally then we don't have a viable system here.  
Any of the world's billionaires or governments could destroy the network at a moment's notice as could a handful of colluding pool operators but they don't, because there is no incentive to do so.
@_date: 2015-12-16 06:25:27
Yeah, I wouldn't be opposed to implementing a reasonable minimum fee.  I did the calculations [here]( and was surprised that the minimum transaction fee would halve along with the block reward halvings.  
The cost of a transaction to the network itself (not to the miner) I think is minimal.  A 4TB harddrive today for $100 can store 8 billion 500 byte transactions making the cost to a node $0.0000000125 per transaction.  Then you multiply that number by 5000 (number of nodes) to get close to your estimate of $0.0001 per transaction cost to the network.  Can you expand on this?  I haven't heard of this kind of metric before.  But nodes today run either altruistically or many are operated by bitcoin businesses where it's necessary, and running a node would be a negligible cost.
I am all for incentivizing nodes, I quite like Dash's attempt at that with their masternodes.  But Dash and lightning both require a large store of coins to operate and qualify for that incentive.  A lightning hub can't relay without a large stash of bitcoin as a buffer.  So that will be a big centralizing force, I don't think it will help with decentralization at all.  
Besides, centralization of nodes is a much smaller problem than centralization of miners.  As long as you can connect to one honest node you are fine.

Maybe it will, maybe it won't, who knows.  Let's take it to the extreme though with a block reward of 1 satoshi in the year 2139.  To maintain today's level of mining revenue (and therefore decentralization) that 1 satoshi would have to be worth $11,000, which would put bitcoin's market cap at $2.3 X 10^19.

Lightning might solve the scalability problem or it might not, I don't know.  But by moving transactions off of the blockchain it is taking fees that would have otherwise gone to the miners.  And as Charlie and I agree, ensuring miners have a subsidy while block rewards continue to halve is the most important thing.
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:04:17
Let me know what you think of my comment here 




















It's also important to note that orphan blocks do not decrease mining revenue as a whole. They decrease an individual miner's revenue. For every block that is orphaned another is accepted, so a high orphan rate won't impact mining revenue of the industry. In fact, counter-intuitively, larger blocks and higher orphan rates actually should mean more revenue for the mining industry as a whole through higher transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-12-16 15:53:53
This is great!  Was hoping someone smarter than me could figure out a generalized equation :)  *p* = ((*s*/*b*)*y*)/600 where *b* is bandwidth, *s* is size of transaction and *y* is number of peers to upload to.  So that could be substituted in for *p* and perhaps we could figure out exactly how much of a disadvantage low bandwidth miners would be at under a large block scenario.
Yeah, weak blocks and IBLT mess it all up haha.  Thanks!

In addition to being the largest bitcoin pool, F2Pool is also the largest litecoin and dogecoin pool.

Dogecoin didn't grow because it was new, there's tons of new altcoins being produced all the time.  It grew because it was attached to a funny meme, and a fun, joking, welcoming community grew out of it overnight.  It was never intended to turn into a get rich quick thing, like so many other altcoins are, it was created by a guy who wanted to prove he wasn't a noob and could create a coin.  That's all its intent was in the beginning.  As for its value, right now it's decreasing mostly because multipools are mining the most profitable altcoins (usually dogecoin, and when they hit us they hit us for almost half our total hash power) and dumping them for bitcoin immediately on the markets, flooding it with sell orders.  We are all well aware of this problem and debate possible solutions as a community pretty much everyday.

It's highly likely that many people will lose lots of coins first.  Transactions between the two chains tend to get lost in the void.  This would basically be disastrous for bitcoin as a whole.  It is very important to get everybody on board.  March 1 isn't enough lead time, imo.  The last time a fork occurred thousands of dollars were lost in a double spend to OkPay.

Super cool!  Consider adding support for other major cryptos too, I know the dogecoin community would love the idea, and might be better for microtransactions since it has near zero transaction fees (I'll probably get down voted for saying this here, but just trying to help you out). You might run out of funding quickly though.
In terms of implementing it, when users sign up you'd have them enter a wallet address, and link it to their data.  You'd convert hours of uptime into a given amount of coin.  You'd use the bitcoin daemon on your Linux server (bitcoind) to automate payouts maybe once a day or once a week (depending on transaction number/transaction ratio), or just based on user requests to withdraw.
Depending on how much money you are holding, you'd probably be wise to store most of it in cold storage so that there's no incentive to hack your server.  Regardless, security will need to be a priority.

It depends on if your wallet accepts non-standard transactions or not.  I think most don't.  If you are using core 0.13.0 as your wallet and someone sends you a transaction with a segwit input, you will reject it as non-standard.  You won't see it until 1st confirmation.

The only blockchain explorer that is showing that transaction is blockchain.info, none of the others do.  My own node doesn't see the transaction either.  I think it's because one of the outputs is only 907 satoshis, most nodes probably view this as a dust output and drop the transaction.  Try to respend the same coins if you can, this time without the dust output, and a higher fee would be good too.

It's 3.45 segwit nodes (core 0.13.1 or 0.13.2) for every bu+classic+xt node, not 7.  There are 2539 segwit nodes (according to bitinfocharts.com) and 737 bu+classic+xt nodes (according to nodecounter.com).  And there are overall fewer segwit nodes than non-segwit nodes.
But this makes OP's theory more true if you ask me, businesses are going to be the fastest to upgrade their nodes, and also are more likely to run nodes than regular users.


They give an incentive for new miners to join their new pool, this is an extremely common strategy in the mining world to bootstrap a new pool.

@_date: 2017-02-09 05:52:51
I feel like I could write a page on every one of these points mentioned, but overall it's a very good summary.  A few misleading items on Segwit pros:


It will take a long time for all wallets to switch over to get the full potential block size increase.  If segwit activated right now, the next transaction you send would still be the old style transaction and not get any benefits of segwit, only if you sent it to a new segwit address and then sent a transaction out of that address would you get segwit benefits.
In addition to that, segwit transactions, in their nested P2SH form as implemented by core and all other major wallets that I know of, use about 11% more data than their non-segwit counterparts.  So it is actually a less efficient way to get more block space than a simple block size increase.  Although it does increase effective block size, it does nothing to increase network capacity, in fact it worsens it.  There is a way to use segwit that uses less space than traditional transactions (BIP142) but it has been abandoned by core and is not backwards compatible with old nodes.


Segwit transactions resolve this, but old style transactions are still supported, so the attack vector still exists.


This is true, however it also opens up an attack.  By decreasing witness data fees by about 4X, it also means you can spam the blockchain with 8.3kB 15of15 1 input 1 output multisig transactions for 4X cheaper than you could before.  It lowers the cost of certain types of signature heavy spam attacks.

Now I own bitcoin too.  If anything altcoins are good for bitcoin.  I understand the hate they get here because so many are scams.  But the ones that aren't shouldn't be lumped in with the likes of paycoin and auroracoin.

I'm not interested in a semantics argument, the fact is nested P2SH segwit transactions take up more hard disk space and bandwidth than an equivalent normal P2PKH transaction.
I'd like to do an analysis on how many UTXOs are unspendable because tx fees have risen higher than the UTXOs are worth.
Nodes already don't relay transactions above 100kB, so to do a coinjoin larger than that you'd need to mine it yourself or convince a miner to manually add it to their block template.

It's not a false dichotomy.  The only way to thread the needle would be to make block size dependant on mempool backlog, which is ripe for abuse.  There has to be another solution, such as, for example, defining how much fees will go into each block and having individual transactions calculate their fees after the fact.  That's just off the top of my head, no idea how that would work, but the crux of the problem is that there are unpredictable transaction fee rewards for a block
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:39:52


I think you're talking about [BIP142]( which is the true, native way to do segwit.  It makes a new address type and is not backwards compatible with older wallets and nodes.  The way core has chosen to implement segwit transactions is via "nested P2SH", which will make segwit addresses look like multisig and other P2SH addresses, and are therefore compatible with current wallets and nodes.  The problem is that nested P2SH segwit transactions are larger than regular bitcoin transactions, about 11% larger.  So while many claim that segwit makes more efficient use of the block space we have, in fact the opposite is true, nested P2SH transactions as implemented by core are a less efficient use of block space.


Technical debt refers to the [hundreds of wallets and services]( that need to write new code to support segwit.  Compared to a block size increase, this is a massive undertaking.  A block size increase requires no wallets or services to write new code to support it, with the exception of full nodes.

It's really not high, all you need is a regular computer (an old laptop will do) and a regular internet connection.

You are in the right place :)  There are alternative subreddits such as bitcoinxt and btc that do not censor info, check those out as well, that's where many of the "raise the max block size" people hang out since their ideas are censored by the mods here.


This would be kinda weird, because bitcoin transactions usually contain two outputs, one going to where you are sending money and one going back to an address you control, the so called "change address".  There wouldn't be a way at the protocol level to figure out which output goes to someone else and which goes to you.  So, if I own 100 BTC in one address, and want to send you 1, what I actually do at the protocol level is send 1 to you and 99 to myself.


Satoshi's orginal idea was that all nodes would be also miners and that is how they were incentivized for the first years.  When mining became decoupled from nodes that idea broke, and now that's how it is.

This is wrong, with 800kB of "real" transactions you would only need 200kB of double fee spam to cause disruption.  It would be more expensive to fill up 2MB blocks (1.2MB of spam) with normal fees than 1MB blocks with double fees.  It costs more to disrupt when you have a block size cap higher than actual demand.  This is why we never saw spam attacks until blocks were full or almost full.  When they are almost full, you need far fewer transactions to cause disruption.

That's an interesting read, hadn't seen it.  The authors themselves though point out that "simply maintaining the block-size limit probably won’t resolve the underlying issues", so your source disagrees with you.  "Our results suggest a fundamental rethinking of the role of block rewards in cryptocurrency design".  Negligible block rewards is a very serious problem for bitcoin (I've been saying so for a long time) I'm glad these guys are pointing it out.  
I hope people work on real solutions to it, because to have a "considerable and persistent" transaction backlog is not an ideal solution.  It's a catch-22, if you have more transactions than can ever be processed and the backlog is growing infinitely, then you get transactions that never confirm, which is essentially the same thing as bitcoin being broken, and then fewer people use it, and then you don't have considerable and persistent backlog anymore.  We see this already, transaction backlogs happen in waves, they ebb and flow, when it gets too large there are fewer transactions and finally the backlog clears, only for it to fill up again.  So that's not a sustainable solution to the negligible block reward problem either.

Why are we even having this argument?  It's all semantics.  Users and miners have a mutualistic relationship.  Neither is in "control" they are co-dependent.

Good point, but so long as t is set to the long term average (600s) it should even out.  A block is only orphaned when the real t &lt;= (s/b)y.  So while you can't predict whether a given block will be orphaned, you can say with confidence in the long term what the orphan rate will be given a long term average of t.  Or maybe I'm misunderstanding, are you saying if a block takes 1 second to propagate to all miners, the long term orphan rate will be something other than 1/600?


Yeah, absolutely true.  The model can take that situation into account relatively easily by adding a latency (*l*) to each y.  So if you have 7 Martian miners and you want to see how long a block to one of them would take to propagate from earth to Mars, you would take the sum of s/by1+*l*+s/by2+*l*+s/by3+*l*... etc..  (Not sure how to do subscript but 1, 2 and 3 are supposed to be subscript not coefficients).  And if bandwidth from earth to Mars is different than earth to earth, you would adjust b in the same way.  In this way you can literally model the whole network of miners and calculate precisely the orphan rate for any individual miner as long as latency and bandwidth are known to every other miner.

Almost all litecoin farms are mining doge also (dogecoin implemented AuxPoW merged mining about 8 months ago), as evidenced by the comparitive hashrates of litecoin and dogecoin.  They are about the same, no more than 10% difference.  So a large litecoin farm has roughly the same chance at being able to attack litecoin as it does dogecoin.  Since dogecoin's marketcap is much smaller, it is much less of a target for an attack than litecoin.

That may be true, but bitcoin cannot survive in that state, so it's a moot point.  Either you have an infinitely growing backlog of transactions or you have occasional backlogs that ebb and flow.  There is no middle ground, you cannot thread the needle on that.  With an infinitely growing backlog you have ever increasing numbers of transactions that will not confirm, no matter how much CPFP, RBF or accelerator services there are.  With an occasional backlog that gets cleared, which is what will actually happen, you still have the same problem when you have negligible fees.  So it is not a solution whatsoever.

We can fit in the neighborhood of 2000 transactions per block.  How many more transactions than that do we expect?  The answer to your question depends on that.  Historically, we've seen exponential growth in number of transactions ([source](  If we expect that trend to continue we'll see over 2000 transactions probably this year, and consistently over probably next year.  Either transactions will pile up in mempools and nodes will crash due to low RAM (like we saw during one of the spam attacks last year, lost about 10% of nodes from this), or nodes will simply eject transactions from their mempool and they will never reach miners and never confirm, creating a bunch of "stuck" transactions and posts on reddit saying "it's been days and my transaction still hasn't gone through".  
Today we usually respond to these with "it will go through eventually" but when we have more transactions than can fit into blocks we will have to respond with "it never will, you'll need to re-broadcast your transaction with a higher fee" (something most wallets don't support today).  So now we've just turned 1 transaction into 2 transactions which may exacerbate the problem.  Required fees would be unpredictable and always increasing.
My personal opinion on what would happen?  We'd just see fewer transactions, exponential growth would halt.  People would use altcoins or other things instead of paying bitcoin's large fees and dealing with its bad UX.  It will continue working as it does today, but the growth in the amount of transactions will stop.
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:36:05

Unavailable space affects demand (it decreases it).  Available space does not.  As I mentioned, 6 years of bitcoin and thousands of years of alts have shown that having *waaaayyy* more blockchain space than is needed does not affect demand - blocks are still not filled because there is a minimum fee.
In bitcoin today we have an artificial unavailable blockchain space.  This does decrease demand by decreasing supply and increasing price, similar to how a coalition of oil companies might withhold selling oil in order to artificially drive up the global price.  A cartel.  Yet there is a minimum price at which the oil companies can sell oil and no longer be profitable no matter how much supply they produce.  This is a true free market.

In a best case scenario where 100% of nodes are working with core-recommended default settings, then yes, only a subset of nodes that receive the low fee transaction from the originator's wallet will have to use more bandwidth.  But mempool management is ultimately user configurable, and the reality is we have many different implementations that use different mempool management strategies.  Some nodes will drop the transaction immediately, some will let it sit in mempool and relay periodically until it ages without confirmation and drop it, and some will hold on to it and relay it and all RBF versions of it indefinitely until it gets confirmed.  No matter the scenario, all of the outcomes use more network bandwidth to varying degrees than just broadcasting a transaction once when we don't have to worry about mempool backlogs.

I've thought about this a lot.  I've come to the conclusion that at this point in time, it isn't an advantage to the consumer to use cryptocurrency, but it is an advantage to the merchant to accept it.
1.  Cryptocurrency has near instantaneous transactions.  Credit cards and paypal and bank transfers take days.  You don't notice this as a consumer, because it says you paid immediately after you paid, but the merchant doesn't get the money until a few days(!) later.
2.  Cryptocurrency has negligible transaction fees.  Credit cards, paypal and bank transactions take a few percent of the transaction.  You don't notice this as a consumer, because those fees are built into the price of the item you are buying, so you are paying them, but you don't know it.
3.  By accepting cryptocurrency as a merchant, you cannot be scammed by the consumer, as it is a one-way final transaction.  They can't counterfeit money (with the obvious exception of a 51% attack) and they can't claim fraudulent chargeback on their credit card or paypal account, and they can't write checks that bounce.  This will lead to lower fees for the merchants.  As a consumer, you don't notice the increase in prices due to stolen items and fraudulent chargebacks, because these are built into the price that you pay up front.
So you see where I am going.  Using cryptocurrencies has numerous financial advantages to merchants who accept them.  In time, widespread use of cryptocurrency will lead to lower prices for customers who pay with them.  Right now though, most companies simply translate the fiat/USD price of the item into what it equals in whatever crypto.  This gives the merchants higher profit margins, because of the inherent advantages with crypto.  Eventually, they will realize that they can offer the same product at a lower price in crypto than their competitors who only accept fiat.  *This is when the consumer wins by using crypto.*  But we aren't there yet.  In the meantime, we need to keep using cryptos at merchants so that they see the cost savings and all those advantages I mentioned.

When studies such as this one are done, they have to use bitcoin as-is.  You can't calculate block propagation while taking into account a centralized relay network, because it can't be assumed that every miner has access to it.  So these studies (rightly, imo) assume it doesn't exist in their calculations while adding a footnote that it does.  If the propagation improvements the relay network offers were taken into account for their calculations, they would have arrived at a much larger block size than 4MB.  The relay network though, unlike thin blocks, help only miners and not nodes with propagation.
Thin blocks, while not as good as the relay network, are a protocol improvement.  Every miner and every node can use it, unlike the relay network.  It offers on average ~13X speedup of block propagation, and in conjunction with the libsecp256k1 verification and getblocktemplate speedups in core 0.12 (which the authors were not using) make blocks much larger than the 4MB concluded here possible at a protocol level.  These are technologies available today.
Should note - thin blocks offer even better propagation speedups when mempools are better synced across the network.  If blocks were larger, nodes wouldn't need to be dropping mempool transactions and thus would be better synced with other mempools, and propagation speeds would improve even more with thin blocks.

Before we had limited block size we had a minimum fee miners were willing to mine.  We also had 50kB of high priority 0 fee transaction space.  And we never approached the block size limit during this era.
Today, fees are currently artificially inflated by limiting the block size.  If fees dropped back down to that minimum rate by increasing the block size, then yes, we would probably have marginally more transactions than we have today since some people are priced out of using bitcoin.  This is a good thing.

There is no decentralization sacrifice, not with the relay network,  libsecp256k1, thin blocks, and the getblocktemplate latency improvements that we have available now.  Validation is sped up 7X, block propagation ~14X, and block generation somewhere around 10-100X.  6 months ago maybe that argument held water, but now it's leaky as hell.
Further, an ever increasing backlog scenario will lead to runaway (nonlinear) bandwidth usage of nodes due to redundant rebroadcasting of mempool evicted transactions and resending  with RBF.  Keeping blocks at 1MB hurts the decentralization of nodes.  And miners with today's improvements can easily handle much larger blocks than 1MB.

Good question!  Let's see, I'll assume a 5Mbps upload connection costs $50 per month.  5Mbps can upload 60GB in just over a day (26.6 hours).  Let's say the average node uploads to 8 peers (this could be significantly reduced by improving overhead in the protocol, a perfect protocol would only need to enough bandwidth to upload to 1 peer), so 213.3 hours.  There are 720 hours in a month, so 213.3/720 = 30% of a month's bandwidth.  $50 X 0.3 = $15 to upload a 60GB blockchain to 8 peers.  5000 nodes X $15 = $75,000.  So $75,000 bandwidth + $7,500 storage = $82,500 cost to the network from a $5 million attack.  (Please don't ask me to estimate the extra cost of CPU cycles)

I don't think he "came up" with it, it's strikingly similar to one of [Gavin Andresen's proposals from seven months ago]( but using a median instead of average and a longer block time.  I really like this proposal because it preserves the max block size limit for its original intent as an anti-DOS measure against large blocks, but still allows transaction volume to grow organically without artificial impediment.  I think this is my new favorite proposal.

Yes.  In terms of bandwidth usage an attacker can make the network transmit much more data using multisig, which gets a huge discount in SegWit.  For example:
Here's a simple transaction I made, 1 input and 1 output, the smallest transaction possible, it is 191 bytes:  
And here is a 8 of 15 multisig transaction I made, with similarly 1 input and 1 output.  It is 1186 bytes:  
In Segwit, much of that multisig data doesn't go into a block, but the miners and network have to have it to verify the transaction.  So with SegWit, an attacker targeting bandwidth gets more bang for their buck, so to speak.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:25:39
Note that 2-4 weeks ago 14 satoshi/byte would get you included within 4-6 blocks ( and was considered a normal fee, not low value.  This is a somewhat standard fee that many wallets will choose by default.  So "some people have created lots of low value transactions" in this case are just normal users paying normal fees.

One problem is people will very quickly pirate the content.  Let's say the content creator charges $1 to download the torrent.  There will be people who will rush to download it, make their own torrent, then start charging $0.50 to download it, stealing the profits from the content creator.
Since bittorent is really designed to allow free and decentralized exchange of information, I don't really think it's a good system for selling your content.  If pirates are suddenly able to make profits in bitcoin through the bittorrent protocol, I think it will open up a whole host of new problems with piracy, more likely to harm the bittorrent and bitcoin scene than to help it.
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:26:09
You are wrong.  If the two choices are increasing the max block size and having an increasing transaction backlog, increasing the max block size is the better choice if you are a node operator.  An increasing transaction backlog *exponentially* increases the amount of bandwidth and/or RAM a node requires, while increasing the max block size only linearly increases storage, CPU, RAM and bandwidth costs.
The reasoning is simple, when we have more transactions than can be included a node has two choices.  
1.  Increase the amount of RAM dedicated to mempool
2.  Evict transactions from the mempool
If a node chooses 2, then transactions will be rebroadcasted to it repeatedly by nodes that choose 1.  Which will increase their bandwidth usage.  So it's a tradeoff.  Since mempool management is user configurable mempools will never be synced between all nodes, so some will always be rebroadcasting transactions that other nodes have dropped.  And further, users who want to get their transactions confirmed will be rebroadcasting them using RBF.
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:48:41
That's not true.  The cost of adding data to a block is equal to the additional risk of orphaning the block that propagating the data incurs.  It's described by this equation:  
    f = minimum fee a transaction must pay to get included. Also equals the marginal risk of orphan that the miner takes by including it. (BTC)
    r = block reward (BTC)
    s = size of transaction (Bytes)
    b = upload bandwidth of miner (Bytes per second)
    y = number of peers miner will propagate the block to
    t = network average time to find a block (Seconds)
    n = total number of transactions in the block.

Miners.  Not nodes.  Transaction backlog is horrible for nodes.  There are 4 major costs to running a node:
1.  Storage (hard disk)
2.  Validation (CPU time)
3.  Broadcasting (bandwidth)
4.  Mempool (RAM)
Increasing the max block size increases storage and validation time but decreases bandwidth and RAM.  An increasing transaction backlog increases required bandwidth and RAM but decreases storage and validation time.  Bandwidth and RAM are the limiting factors in running a node, storage and CPU are not significant costs.

I get the distinction.  In practice what a soft-fork meant is that only miners have to upgrade, nodes can do so at their own pace.

@_date: 2017-03-17 17:06:25
I'm against it for two reasons, but neither of the ones you listed:
Segwit has two huge flaws. 1 is that the nested P2SH way of doing txes that core implemented (and almost all other wallets) to maintain backwards compatibly is a less efficient use of block space, the transactions are around 11% larger than their equivalent P2PKH. 
And 2 is that it opens up a spam attack to take up about 3.7MB of space, while only allowing 1.7MB-2MB of normal transactions. That may be fine for now, because even 3.7MB blocks are something that nodes and miners can easily handle today. But, once we run out of segwit space, a block size increase will have to happen (in about a year if we extrapolate recent growth in transaction rate). If we double it, then we get ~4MB of normal transactions and 8MB potential spam attack blocks. And for 8MB of normal transactions we'd have 16MB of potential spam blocks.  And so on for even bigger blocks.
Combined, these two things make segwit the opposite of scalability, they make bitcoin less scalable.

If the cryptography were broken we'd have much larger problems as a society than bitcoin being broken.  That said, my understanding is that as long as you don't re-use addresses - that is, send two or more transactions from the same address - then even quantum computers can't crack bitcoin.  Once a pubkey is broadcast the private key becomes vulnerable to a quantum attack.  This could be fixed with a fork away from ECDSA for signatures.

Best part about this proposal.  Should some hostile miner try to make artificially large blocks to force out low bandwidth miners, they will return in kind by defensively mining empty blocks to avoid propagation delays and validation time which the hostile big miners hope to exploit.  Empty blocks decrease max block size.  In combination with head first mining and other propagation improvements like thin blocks and validation improvements like libsecp256k1, the centralization pressure to miners from big blocks is finally solved.

@_date: 2016-03-31 20:20:49
Nah, it sets a precedent that mempools should stay as synchronized as possible.  The best way to do that is to not drop any transactions, but if it does become necessary to drop there are still ways of keeping mempools synced.  For example now mempools are customizable by the end user, but if everyone ran the default parameters of core for `maxmempool`, `mintxrelayfee`, and `mempoolexpiry` then everything would stay synced.  It should also be possible to see how many of your connected nodes have a given transaction, and if, say, a majority of them do then that transaction overrides your settings and you keep it instead of drop it.  Or you know something like that, I'm not a coder.  Miners could also advertise the blocktemplate they are mining to nodes (called weak blocks), and nodes could prioritize those transactions which will be in the next block and not drop them - which would help miners as well with their block propagation.
But synced mempools != large max block size.

Aethereum is indeed more accurately described as a fork.  Clams are an altcoin, they have their own genesis block.  They do use data from bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin's blockchains to determine Clam distribution, but it is its own chain.

During an attack months ago there were a ton of ~15kB transactions that paid ~1000 satoshi fee.  They still stick around in mempools but never get mined.  That's why your average tx size is large, you have some of those.
My settings are mintxrelayfee=0.00001101 and maxmempooltx=1000 (but I run XT, core doesn't have the maxmempooltx feature).  I keep the mempool at a low 1000 transactions because much more than that and you start to see large performance decrease in getblocktemplate, which I need to do because mine is a mining node.  If it weren't mining, I'd probably set the maxmempooltx to 10,000 or so.

Regular transactions are about 40% signature data, so they get an effective max block size of ~1.6MB.  P2SH transactions however, such as 8 of 15 multisig, are a much higher proportion of signature data, not sure exactly but well over 90%, so they get an effective max block size of over 4MB.  So a smart attacker can DoS the network with &gt;4MB of data, while we only get an effective block size increase to ~1.6-1.8MB.

@_date: 2016-01-06 06:48:31
Eh, it's really not that technical.  It's one line of code.  Hundreds of altcoins have implemented a higher effective block size with faster blocks, none of them have been attacked in the way the devs are worried about.  That's hundreds of coin-years worth of data on forks of bitcoin.  All would be much less risky and easier to pull off an attack against than bitcoin would be.  But it just hasn't happened.  Some (profitable mining) coins have a 2 second block time, orphan rates are 20% and they haven't been bandwidth attacked.
I don't think the devs are very interested in data.  If they were, they'd see that mining decentralization has *increased* over the past couple years despite block size doubling approximately every year.  Not decreased.  And orphan rate has stayed about the same since 2009.  The real world data is conclusive, bigger blocks are not a problem.  
I guess segwit is cool.  But it only increases tps by 1.6-1.8X.  That's less than the most conservative BIP, Garzik's 2MB proposal.  I still support it because I support anything that increases throughput, but segwit is the lamest increase ever.  And by the way, I don't think it should even be called a soft-fork, that seems like a technicality definition.  If full nodes are no longer able to validate transactions and must upgrade to do so then it should be considered a hard fork.

I'm glad you are at least thinking about the diminishing returns problem of mining, because it is a huge problem.  Not any time soon, but it needs to be solved at some point before block rewards are negligible.
The authors themselves say that having a persistent backlog doesn't solve the issue.


Moreover, it's impossible to have a persistent backlog.  Either it grows indefinitely or it clears occasionally.  Either there's 1 or more too many transactions or there's 1 or more too few.  The only way to thread that needle and get 0 transactions too many and 0 too few would be some crazy complex dynamic max block size.

I also know that miners would not be wise to mine a different chain than what exchanges and users are using.  Brian knows this, Emin knows this, you know this, and I know this.  It's a pointless and semantic debate.  No one controls bitcoin entirely.  We all have a say.  So absolutes like Brian said are incorrect and absolutes like Emin said are incorrect.

Either follow your own rules as they are written, or change them.  But don't remove stuff and ban people for reasons made up on the spot.  "Inconsistent enforcement" and "banning people with dissenting opinions" is not a gross mischaracterization.
You've also claimed that changing the default sort  is not meant to manipulate opinions but to keep personal attacks and misinformation from becoming the top comment.  However I've seen many instances where this was done simply to move someone's personal opinion as top comment.

These things make it clear that "manipulation of public perception through moderation" is not a gross mischaracterization.

Lightning network can't operate with constantly full blocks.  In order to be protected from someone stealing your money by broadcasting an old channel state, you need to be able to get your punishing transaction confirmed before the lock time ends of the old channel state transaction.  If blocks are constantly full you have no guarantee you will be able to do that.  You cannot change the fee that your punishing transaction pays without a signature from the other party, so RBF won't work either.  You could use CPFP to get it confirmed, but then so could the thieving party to get theirs confirmed instead (they spend the same utxos), and you could compete back and forth indefinitely, this just results in the miners getting the full balance of the channel.  You could have the punishing transaction pay a very large fee to begin with, but who knows when you might need it, the network fees are very unpredictable and rising constantly with full blocks.  Even if blocks aren't full, the thief can still just spam higher fee transactions than your punishing transaction to make sure it won't confirm during the lock time.  All this means that with full or nearly full blocks, lightning is almost useless except for very small value transactions.

@_date: 2016-03-05 05:03:41


It definitely doesn't scale linearly.  Rational miners will not choose to generate such large blocks.  For that to be profitable, transaction fees would need to approach infinity.  And yes, the model breaks down in that scenario.


A great point.  This is the so called "accidental selfish mining" right?  It favors you in the short term but not in the long term.


That's not right, it highly depends on transaction fees whether or not a miner would generate blocks that large.  I made this model into a python script  it would be really awesome if you played around with it.

The EB1 miners won't be building on top of the attack block, and once 11 blocks deep neither will the EB1.1 miners (edit:  assuming a 50/50 split between EB1 and EB1.1 miners hashpower of course).  So no, you can't orphan 11 blocks at once, just 6 or less (1.1 miners build 5 blocks on top of the attack block, 1.0 miners build 6 blocks on top of block prior to attack block, 13th block is found by 1.1 miners and locks in the attack block chain, orphaning 6 1.0 blocks).


I suppose it's possible.  But the 1.1 miners will have access to the same transaction pool as 1.0 miners and will be rejecting double-spend attempts, like always.  Hmm... I have to think about that one.


Any suggestions?

I think the old chain would persist in some capacity.  When dogecoin hard forked to implement AuxPoW some people continued mining on the old pre-AuxPoW chain.  Even today a year and a half later the branch isn't completely inactive.  It even caused an exchange to fail and people to lose money.  I can't remember the name of the exchange right now, but I can look into it if you want.  The exchange hadn't upgraded to the new fork, so they were accepting coins that were mined on the old fork for deposits.  Obviously these weren't valid post-AuxPoW.  And when people went to withdraw they were finding their withdraws weren't valid.  The exchange had mixed up old fork and new fork coins together.  They lost liquidity and the exchange collapsed.
Overall, the hard fork was very successful I'd say.  But there are risks, and with bitcoin's ecosystem being so much larger than dogecoin's, I'd be astonished if there weren't at least one guy out there that runs some fire and forget automated financial service that didn't upgrade, will accept coins mined on the 1MB branch, and cause problems.  I am in favor of a hard fork, but it does need to be done carefully and with a long activation period, giving plenty of time to upgrade.  (Dogecoin gave about a month iirc to upgrade, it was an emergency situation.  I think bitcoin's should be much longer than that).

I know we've had differences but I've always liked you :)  One thing that a certain side likes to say is "what keeps miners from just increasing the block reward to 10,000,000 BTC to favor them".  Well other miners and users keep that from happening.  A successful fork will be in the interest of all parties, users, exchanges, merchants, devs and miners.  Only when all parties, (or a majority of all parties) agree will the fork happen.  Anecdotal, but from what I've seen is all but the devs agree that a hard fork max block size increase must happen.

I don't know about all soft-forks (did BIP66 downgrade security of old nodes or did it upgrade security of updated nodes?)  But some certainly do, or can.  SegWit definitely does, really badly, old nodes would be completely unable to verify new transactions.  
I first said this as a joke but then found it is actually possible - that we could just move all transaction data into extension blocks linked to a merkle root in the coinbase of bitcoin blocks, similar to the segwit proposal.  Then we could have a soft-forked unlimited max block size.  Old nodes would just see empty bitcoin blocks aside from a coinbase that contains data they don't understand.  That would be technically a soft-fork but it would make old nodes useless.
So clearly not all soft-forks are created equal.

This is the inherent problem with sidechains.  You *will not* gain any traction from miners, because you cannot have an incentive to mine without creating more than 21 million bitcoins.  Sure, they could collect transaction fees, but they can already do that on bitcoin.  There is no reason to move bitcoin transactions onto sidechains if you want to scale.  Sidechains are not a scalability solution.
And the problem with Lightning is similar.  If we move bitcoin transactions onto the Lightning network, then we are essentially stealing those transaction fees from miners.  As bitcoin continues to halve its rewards miners will be left with little to no incentive to mine if 99%+ transactions have moved off-chain, transactions which they otherwise would have taken fees for.  This would have a far greater centralizing effect than simply raising the block size and using bitcoin traditionally.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:51:53
Yeah, long-term it is intended to transition to P2WPKH and P2WSH as outlined in BIP142.  These transactions actually take up a few bytes less than P2PKH and P2SH.  But it will *again* require all wallets and service providers to update their code to use them, after having already updated to use nested P2SH segwit.  The big downside to using them is that current wallets and services not upgraded to segwit will not know if someone sends you a payment coming from a P2WPKH address, it will be seen as non-standard and rejected.  So this rollout will take even longer than the (still incomplete) rollout of nested P2SH.
The spam blocks would take up storage for all time, not just during the attack, but yeah they only take up extra bandwidth for duration of the attack.  I don't see how the signature data affects the number of UTXOs.  A smart spammer won't use any UTXOs.  There's two main ways to spam, chain transactions together spending one after another, 1 input 1 output each time just paying a fee.  And the other is to start with 1 UTXO and split it into many, then reconsolidate them back into 1.  If a spammer is creating UTXOs then they are spending extra money on top of fees unnecessarily.
Segwit does not remove the quadratic sighashing attack vector, because old style transactions are still valid.  So an attacker can still use them.
I agree that segwit is good for second layer and other stuff like schnorr signatures, but there are also other ways to get those implemented besides segwit using a more elegant hard fork.

It's not that huge.  A modest 5Mbps upload connection (that hundreds of millions of people around the globe have access to) is capable of 1.62TB upload per month.  Most users aren't very concerned about upload bandwidth, the only time it comes into play is for video calls really.  Maybe some online games, but I do a lot of online gaming and run a bitcoin node and 3 altcoin nodes, a reddit bot, and dash and bitcoin p2pool nodes, while gaming and sometimes streaming on a 5Mbps upload connection and don't have any problem.  
And the vast majority of the world don't have data caps.
I use about 1TB total data (up and down) per month.
Edit:  Also, OP's node is a high capacity, well connected node.  There is no reason you couldn't reduce your maximum connections to, say, 10, and still run a useful node and contribute to the network meaningfully.
Edit 2:  Also, a constantly growing mempool is going to need to boot transactions.  Those transactions will be resent and re-relayed by nodes, multiple times.  Arguably, a policy of booting transactions from the mempool will mean higher bandwidth usage than increasing the max block size where transactions won't have to be booted and resent.

How were we tricked by any of those 3?  None of them have anything to do with BU development.  Yes, it sucks that there are bugs.  The block size is the most important issue in bitcoin though.  BU isn't even my preferred way of increasing it.  But I will always support any client that proposes to raise the block size limit over core, so long as core insists on staying at 1MB or activating segwit.
Before you say segwit is a block size increase, it has two huge flaws.  1 is that the nested P2SH way of doing txes that core implemented (and almost all other wallets) to maintain backwards compatibly is a less efficient use of block space, the transactions are around 11% larger than their equivalent P2PKH.  And 2 is that it opens up a spam attack to take up about 3.7MB of space, while only allowing 1.7MB-2MB of normal transactions.  That may be fine for now, because even 3.7MB blocks are something that nodes and miners can easily handle today.  But, once we run out of segwit space, a block size increase will have to happen.  If we double it, then we get ~4MB of normal transactions and 8MB potential spam attack blocks.  And so on for even bigger blocks.
Combined, these two things make segwit the opposite of scalability, they make bitcoin less scalable.
So that's why I still support any client that wants to raise the block size, and not core with segwit.

That doesn't look stable at all.


So you are saying you would like an infinite number of people to have to rebroadcast their transactions an infinite number of times and have an infinite number of unconfirmed transactions?  Because that's what grows indefinitely means.  Otherwise, you have a backlog which clears occasionally, and causes the mining centralization risks the authors were talking about.  There is surely a far more elegant solution to the problem than having a persistent backlog.  What if transaction fees were paid to block number n+1 instead of the current block?  I'd like to see the authors run the simulations on that.


Yes the tools exist.  Yet no one uses them, or very few do.  Why didn't you use it when block space was plenty and fees were cheap?


Do you know what that price is?  100GB of google drive costs $2 per month.  100GB on bitcoin would take 29 months *just to upload* assuming there are no other transactions.  Are you going to wait 2 and a half years to upload that?  29MB blocks would allow you to upload it in 1 month.  And we aren't even adding in costs assuming even minimal fees.  For example, dogecoin, one of the cheapest cryptos, has a feerate of 1 doge per kB of transactions.  Ignoring the fact that OP_RETURN can only do a max of 80 bytes and the rest of the transactions is around 300 bytes, let's just say it's a simple 1 doge per kB.  That's 100 million doge per 100GB, which is $238 dollars.  Or the same cost as 10 years of google drive storage (which will be even cheaper by the time that 10 years is up).  And this is the cheapest crypto there is, at least that I know of.  No one is going to do it, because it's stupid.  And it's stupid to think it will happen.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:53:51
Well the entire security model of bitcoin is dependant on 51% of miners being good and honest.  What you're describing is just another (worse) way to 51% attack bitcoin.  A better way for them to achieve the same thing today would be to just orphan everyone else's transactions, so this doesn't sound like a security hole that BU opens up, it already exists.

Probably poorly worded on my part.  "Low" is a subjective term.  What I meant is that 10k/kB is a normal-to-high fee transaction in the context of all bitcoin transactions.  Blocktrail.com right now estimates that a fee of 2500/kB has a 75% chance of getting included in the next block.  So I would consider that a normal-to-low fee.  Not sure why Rusty chose 10k/kB to analyze if he was trying to look at stuck transactions, those transactions don't have problems and no one said they did.

He missed the part about getting your private key.  To import to blockchain.info you will need your private key of your bitcoin address(es).  If your 1 bitcoin is in just 1 address then you just need that one, but if it is in multiple addresses you need all of their private keys.  To get the private keys from your client you will need to use the command `walletpassphrase YOURPASSWORD 300` (300 is the amount of seconds to stay unlocked, this command is only required if you have password protected your wallet) and then `dumpprivkey YOURADDRESS`. The console will give you the private key for that address, repeat as necessary for different addresses if you have them.  Then you can go to blockchain.info and import your wallet using the private key(s) as described.  You do not need to be synced up to do this.

Well, nodes by default drop transactions after 3 days.  But assuming you know how to continually rebroadcast it, a very long lock time would help, but that also means you freeze up your own funds for that long, what if you need to close the channel to access your funds more quickly than that?  Another reason that lightning will only be used for small amounts, no one is going to want to lock up a lot of funds for that long.
If you are both using CPFP, both the punishing transaction and the thieving transaction, then you get into a bidding war for fees.  If the thieving transaction pays more of a fee than you do, i.e. let's say the full balance of the channel, then miners end up playing a game of prisoner's dilemna.  If they all wait for the lock time duration to mine it, then they all have a chance at getting the large fees.  But if one defects and mines your punishing transaction, then that miner gets smaller fees, but is guaranteed them assuming other miners are cooperating and not defecting.  It's really a poor way to guarantee they mine your transaction, banking on one of them defecting (and also hoping they have enough hashpower to confirm it in time).

Here is what I could find of the miners who are explicitly supporting BU and not segwit.
[Antpool Will Not Run SegWit Without Bitcoin Block Size Increase Hard Fork](
[ViaBTC, currently representing some 8 percent of hash power on the Bitcoin network, has indicated it will not support SegWit activation. Instead, the mining pool favors a hard fork to remove the one megabyte block size limit, as proposed by Bitcoin Core fork Bitcoin Unlimited.](
BTC.top founder: [The market needs big blocks. If Core doesn’t want to (or can’t) give it, the market will take it by itself. No one can go against the market, unless he can show more money.](
GBminers founder:  [[segwit is a] “small to medium level increase in the network capacity.” In his view, Bitcoin Unlimited offers the best long-term scaling solution without altering how Bitcoin has worked in the past.](
[CANOE pool ultimately supports whichever solution will increase bitcoin’s capacity. While Bitcoin Unlimited is more favorable to the team right now, they are keeping a close eye on other scaling solutions. BU’s plan is not “the best” in their opinion, but the capacity increase is a solid suggestion](
And I think everyone knows how Roger Ver and his bitcoin.com mining pool feel about it.

@_date: 2017-03-09 22:59:45
Ah I see.  So the assumption is that there is wide diversity in miners' chosen EB.  I think the point of broadcasting EB/AD in the coinbase is so that miners can converge around an acceptable EB for everyone.  BU calls it emergent consensus, so they are assuming that everyone will agree on the EB.  I don't know which assumption is correct, but so far at least all the BU miners are broadcasting EB1/AD6, so it seems to be working so far.
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:50:16
If AD=12, then the EB=1 miners could only get 6 blocks orphaned, if they mine 7 or more blocks then they have built the longest chain and the "attack" block gets orphaned.  But yeah, I get your point about the potential of confirmed transactions disappearing and that would be inconvenient, but as long as a majority of miners aren't malicious they will confirm again.  It's arguably still a better user experience than transactions never confirming in the first place like we have now.
What's a sticky gate?
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:08:40
[parallel block validation]( sort of addresses the big blocks problem and the sighash problem (though I would prefer a sigop limit on transactions).  But as for the big blocks problem, miners set their Acceptance Depth (AD) to whatever they want.  So a block that is too large will have to have many blocks mined on top of it as well before it is accepted.  The only way that can happen is if a majority of miners agree that the block is not too large.
As for malleability, there is the [flextrans proposal]( but I don't know if it's under consideration by BU or not.  Segwit doesn't solve malleability once and for all either, because the old-style transactions are still valid, so exchanges and wallets and other software still need to take into account that it's possible in the way they program their software.
Not sure what the median EB attack is.

Not true.  Let's say the sidechain has 1MB blocks every 10 minutes, just like bitcoin.  Now we have a system where we can handle effective 2MB worth of transactions.  If this is almost no cost, then why don't we just raise the block size to 2MB rather than putting transactions on a sidechain?

Only if the network wants changes.  It facilitates changing the block size without everyone having to recompile a client.  But technically, the whole network can recompile a client with their preferred max block size today.  BU just makes it easier.  If the network doesn't want changes then they can set EB1/AD999999 and run with 1MB forever.

I don't feel like it's condescending, no worries lol.  I actually enjoy being able to debate this in for the first time ever (not sure what changed).  It's getting largely semantic though.  I don't think the 21 mil cap is set in stone, if the network thought it should be increased or decreased, it's within everyone's power to change it.  The only way we wouldn't have that power is if bitcoin were closed source.  And the only reason we don't change it is because it was in the whitepaper and everyone agreed to it when they joined the bitcoin network.  The block size limit though wasn't in the whitepaper, it was added to the client with no mention in the release notes at the time, and was controversial even then.  People only agreed because Satoshi assured everyone it would be easy to lift or increase the limit if needed.  So I feel like the block size limit is a violation of what everyone agreed on upon joining the network.  The 21 mil limit though is not so no one wants to change it.  Even if we had a BU type client with a user defined max coin limit, I'm pretty sure everyone would set it to 21 mil, so it's not controversial, and that's the reason it might as well be "set in stone".  The block size limit is different though.  And so here we are.

I think most nodes today are already businesses or datacenter nodes.  I run a home node.  Raspberry pi nodes are still possible properly configured.  About 10% of nodes were fire and forget, we saw them go down when the mempool got flooded with large transaction spam late last year.  I think datacenters and enthusiasts, like me, are the future, as satoshi did.  Pretty much no casual user runs a node, or even businesses - they use coinbase or bitpay nodes - even today.  In my opinion what's important is allowing people like me to run nodes.  People with laptops and tablets as their main devices will never run nodes anyway.  I have a 5820k, 32GB DDR4, GTX 970 btw.  Even from the very first satoshi node, it was designed so that the best computers could run a node.  Back then, mining wasn't decoupled from nodes yet.  Verification is very parallizable (I think the term is "embarrassingly parallelizable"), is it not possible to allocate that to the GPU?
Anyway, I do think Coinjoin, HD, libsecp256k1, Segwit, and confidential transactions are fantastic developments and am very grateful for those who contributed.  Sidechains I am not very optimistic about, I don't see how they could be secure.  They could be merge mined, but miners would have no incentive to mine them, no block reward, and they could offer transaction fees but so could bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:43:52
So two completely separate blockchains and networks, each with their own genesis block, are both bitcoin when it comes to sidechains, but a hard fork where the two chains share a common ancestry, one of those chains is an altcoin?  Madness and illogical.  I know you know better.  The two-way peg merely  ties bitcoin's value to an altcoin.  Bitcoin is a whole lot more than its value.
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:52:13
I'm not jumping from point to point, you are failing to see the big picture.  
- Sidechains cannot give a block reward without increasing 21 million bitcoins.  
- Miners will have no incentive to mine them.  
- Transaction fees are not enough of an incentive, unless you are willing to concede that transaction fees are enough of an incentive to increase the max block size, in which case why not do that instead?  
- They will be merge mined.  Almost any mining pool will be able to 51% attack the sidechain.  Even if by some miracle sidechains do gain 100% of bitcoin's hashing power (which will absolutely never happen), there will be a transition time where it has less and is vulnerable.
- Sidechains put the value of bitcoin onto an inherently less secure blockchain
Namecoin does not have an enormous hashrate, it is highly vulnerable to attack.  There are dozens of other merge mined alts that are even more vulnerable.  Sidechains would be even more vulnerable because they would have no block reward.  Namecoin does give almost no added value, but sidechains give literally 0 added value.
Proof of stake is not an option for sidechains, because that would mean more than 21 million bitcoins.

I wonder if you could implement CPFP on your end, so if a user sends too low of a fee you can still confirm it.  Yeah, you're basically eating the fee that the customer should have paid, but it may be cheaper than the time an employee spends dealing with the customer.  To avoid people taking advantage of it, you could display a minimum fee to include with their transaction on the conversion page, if they don't send with at least that much fee then don't CPFP it.

It only grants them the ability to easily change the size of blocks that they mine, which is an ability that they already have.  They can't make your BU node accept them, nor can they force other miners to accept them.  I'm not seeing either how a miner can accidentally participate in such an attack, as they only need to look at the blockchain to see that there is a minority of miners that are not accepting the blocks they mine or not producing the same sized blocks if they are accepting them.  And if 51% of the mining power were totally self-interested, they would be orphaning the blocks of the other 49% today, so it's a good thing they are not.  Their self-interest is in a healthy and successful bitcoin for their business to be predicable and sustainable, and the best way for them to facilitate that is to be good and honest and not malicious.

Malleability doesn't put the transaction at risk though.  All it does is change the txid of the transaction.  It cannot change the inputs or outputs of the transaction and it can't delete the transaction.  If your business is tracking transactions by their txid then yes, malleability is a pain.  But you should not be tracking them by txid, you should track them by outputs.

The blue line in the top graph here  shows the mempool (number of unconfirmed transactions) for that node.  Zoom out to desired timeframe, if you go far enough out you will plainly see when the various spam attacks, or stress tests took place.  Keep in mind mempools will vary between nodes depending on settings.  There is not a correct answer for "how many unconfirmed transactions are there", you can only answer that for an individual node not the whole network.  OP's link shows it for blockchain.info's node.

I agree it'd probably be helpful, but I'd prefer if testnet were attacked rather than an active altcoin, we've got I think 9.3 MB blocks there now and it'd be easy to increase that quickly by pointing a lot of hashpower at it briefly.  Jtoomin and Luke-Jr could collaborate on this.
P2pool is still tiny, and I think only the largest pools are using SPV mining (mainly F2Pool, they seem to generate more SPV blocks than anyone).  The relay network has helped a lot.
It might be semantic, but I don't think it's pointless because I think it's deceptive calling it a soft-fork to gain acceptance.  Technically we could do the same thing with transaction data itself, throw it all in an extension block linked to a merkle root in the coinbase.  Old nodes would still validate the coinbase-only bitcoin blocks but would be unaware of the real transaction data and that would be technically a "soft-fork" but old nodes would be rendered useless.  Just a more extreme version of soft-fork segwit but it illustrates the point.

Only in the absence of the AD parameter I think.  If it's AD 6 a single block won't do anything, you'd need 5 more on top of it.  Responsible miners would start signaling EB 1.1 but still mine blocks with a soft-limit of 1MB until their peers are signaling EB 1.1 as well (or else they run the risk of being orphaned).

This used to be true, but not anymore.  Look up compact blocks and XThin blocks, they reduce the data needed to transmit a block about 10-15 fold.


Not sure why that matters?  You might get the blocks a couple seconds later if you can't handle big bursts, but it won't impede your node function or the network.


I did, I assumed they used only 25% of their upstream.  In reality people could use far more than 25% (like 90%) and not notice a difference in their internet activities unless they are live streaming or face chatting.


Yes, but luckily these connections are still a minority in the 1st world, as bitcoin users and internet users in general we need to fight against these caps.


Compact blocks and XThin blocks go a long way towards decreasing this effect as well.  But ping time through the great firewall is the smallest of all the factors causing centralization in China.  They have some of the cheapest electricity, cheapest silicon manufacturing, cheapest warehouse/real estate, and cheapest labor in the world.  These are the real centralizing forces, not ping time through the great firewall.


Did you know segwit transactions, in the form of nested P2SH as implemented by core, are actually larger, not smaller than normal transactions?  They use more node resources, not less, that's the opposite of scalability, and changing the block size constant would be better scalability.
@_date: 2016-06-01 19:55:14
It's a nice thought experiment, but let's examine a more realistic scenario, after all if we have a &gt;50% miner we have bigger problems than small miners having a high orphan rate.  So let's look at F2Pool, which is currently around 30% hashrate, and let's pretend it's one large facility and not a pool.  
Side note: pooled mining is a completely different kind of centralization, and one that would almost certainly be helped by faster blocks - because the main incentive for people to join a pool is getting more consistent block rewards day by day (that's the reason they were invented in the first place), and faster blocks especially on the 1-20 second level means much more even reward distribution and so less reason to join a pool and pay the pool their ~1% cut.  No one really wants to contribute to pools' centralization, they just do it because that's how you get even rewards, they don't want to wait weeks or months to maybe get a payout or maybe not.
But let's say we have a 30% farm.  What's the difference in their revenue due to lower orphan rate of the 30% miner?  On average, there is less than 1 orphan block per day, but let's call it an even 1 per day.  So the 30% miner will have a revenue of 144 X 0.3 X 25 = 1080 BTC per day from 43.2 blocks and 0.3 of those blocks would be orphaned each day.  However, since she won't orphan her own blocks, only 0.3 - 0.3 X 0.3 = 0.21 of those blocks will be orphaned per day, an improvement of 0.09 X 25 = 2.25 BTC per day or ~$410,625 per year in added revenue due to her being a big miner not orphaning her own blocks.
How much is $410,625 per year for a 30% miner?  30% is ~420 PH/s.  If those are all Antminer S9's then she has 30,000 of them, an initial investment that cost $63 million dollars.  Her facility will use 41.25 MW of energy, which at a pretty cheap $0.05 per kWh will cost $18.07 million per year to power.  30,000 units packed together will take up a lot of land, I'm not really sure exactly how much, but let's say they each require half of a cubic meter of space?  A cheap warehouse rental in China is about $0.15 per cubic meter per month, so we're only looking at about $27,000 per year to house these machines, much less than I thought.  She'll probably need at least 60 employees working round the clock (is that enough, 1 employee per 500 machines?) which at factory worker wages in China of ~$2/hour is $1.05 million per year.
So initial investment is $63 million, and the yearly costs are  ~$19 million.  A gain of $410,625 per year (big miner bonus due to not orphaning own blocks) is 2.16% of the annual costs, and 0.5% of the annual cost + initial investment.  Her annual revenue as a 30% miner would be about 6 X 24h X 365d X 25btc X $500 X 30% = $197.1 million.  So the $410,625 is about ~~0.02%~~ 0.2% (edit: moved a decimal wrong) of the annual revenue.
Like I said, orphan rate risk is not a major driver of mining centralization.

Just to be clear, you think bitcoin should be an elite club of users, no more than 1800 people making transactions every 10min.

It's not a spam attack, it's a difficulty adjustment.  For weeks prior bitcoin's hashrate had been increasing, and as such blocks were found on average less than 10 minutes apart.  Which was good, because there were more transactions than 10 min blocks could handle.  But now difficulty has readjusted back to 10 min blocks, and there is just too many transactions to fit.

In terms of the total cost to running a node, this is nothing.  A 4TB hard drive costs ~$120 and worst case where every single block is full, it will store 19 years of 4MB blocks, and comes to an annual cost of $5 and change for blockchain storage.  And given that [hard drive capacity grows exponentially]( (increasing ~10X capacity every ~5 years) with no signs of slowing down, this cost will only decrease over time.
Although there have been improvements, initial sync time is still largely limited by CPU (a common 25Mbps down connection can download 270GB of data per day).  I think there are some improvements that could make this faster, as it should be highly parallelizable (could validation be done on a GPU?)

I knew you'd nitpick the exact numbers and miss the point - that the advantage a large miner gets from not orphaning their own blocks in an insignificant sum, not a large centralizing force, not nearly as large as other forces.
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:11:48
That's a dumbed down fact, but it's not entirely false.  If you are running an old, non-segwit compatible node (and segwit is a soft-fork remember) then you can still only accept a 1MB max block.  It's just that the signatures were removed from some transactions and appear as anyone-can-spend so that they are smaller.
If you run a segwit-compatible node, then yes, blocks are larger than 1MB.  However as implemented by core, nest P2SH segwit transactions are also larger than their standard transaction counterpart by about 5% or so.  So as compared to a regular old block size increase, segwit is less efficient on the disk space.  If you compare segwit as implemented's block size increase, segwit actually uses more disk space than the equivalent block size increase would.
Speaking of false facts, the pro-segwit people always seem to allude that segwit is an instantaneous block size increase.  Surprisingly few people know (or at least say) that users have to opt-in to using it, which means they have to move their funds before they can use segwit.
@_date: 2016-06-01 21:11:22
Ok, fixing orphan rate to 1% gives a 30% miner 0.1296 blocks per day advantage instead of 0.09.  Halving the reward to 12.5 BTC and adjusting the price from $500 to $280 that's $165,564 additional revenue per year for being a big miner.  And annual revenue gets adjusted down to $55.2 million per year.  That's a 0.3% advantage.  1.5 ~~orders of magnitude~~ times, not 2 orders of magnitude (edit: moved a decimal wrong above), but still insignificant.


Anyone no matter the size of the miner can blindly mine off of their stratum to get the same advantage.
@_date: 2016-06-01 06:20:15
You asked bitcoin unlimited devs to write a spec?
@_date: 2017-01-15 17:13:56
It's a good question.  The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, not every 5 minutes, and blocks are found on average every 10min, although this can vary considerably from ~30sec to ~2h or more, just due to luck.
Your questions is essentially, what are miners actually hashing?
Many things, all the data contained in the next block in the blockchain. Blocks contain transactions and block header data. When the miner's node receives new transactions from the network, the miner incorporates them into the next block's data and continues hashing.
Block headers contain 6 things:
1. The miner's client version. Pretty straight forward, the version number of the software the miner is using.
2. The hash of the previous block in the blockchain. This is what was calculated by the miners last time, and is now being calculated for the next block.
3. The Merkle root of all transactions on the block. This is confusing for some, but it is basically just the hashes of all transactions in the block in a special data object which allows an individual transaction to be confirmed as part of a block, without downloading all transactions in the block.
4. A timestamp.
5. The target difficulty of the network.
6. A nonce (random number).
All of that data is getting hashed through the SHA256 algorithm into a 256 bit number.
5 and 6 need more explaining. The difficulty is readjusted every 2016 blocks by the protocol, known as the re-targeting period. The reason for the difficulty field is to keep blocks being found on average every 10 minute, no matter how many miners there are. The more miners, the higher the difficulty. Miners are hashing trillions of numbers per second between 1 and 2^256. The resulting hash number that miners generate must be a number smaller than the target difficulty of the network to be valid, which is why all recent block hashes start with many leading 000000s. That's how the network keeps blocks being found every 10 min on average.
But if miners are calculating trillions of times per second (the whole network put together is about 2000 petahashes per second), and if the input data stays the same, won't miners just be calculating the same thing over and over again, until the timestamp changes or a new transaction comes in to change the input data? Good question, yes. That is what the nonce is for (number 6). The nonce is a random 32 bit number that miners insert into the block header. Even the smallest change in input data will completely change the output hash. So miners can add in random bits of data in the nonce so that they aren't calculating the same thing over and over, and have a new chance at finding a hash number lower than the target difficulty with every calculation.

Let's look at the numbers.  With a month of full 1MB blocks, you get 4.32GB worth of blocks.  To maintain a healthy network, each node should upload at least as much as it downloads, so it's getting 4.32GB it needs to upload at least that much to other nodes.  That works out to 13.3kbps upload needed during the month, which is less than dialup.  
Now obviously, this is bare minimum, and there will be some overhead as well, so let's call it 25kbps.  Also, let's say you want to upload to 8 times more than you download to be a truly good network participant, and only want to dedicate 25% of your upload bandwidth to running a node.  
Now to be a good node, you need 800kbps upload.  [According to this map]( only 6 countries have an average upload speed lower than that, Venezuela, Syria Guinea, Gambia, Burkina Faso, and Niger.
But that's with 1MB blocks, how about 4MB blocks?  Well now we'd need a minimum of 100kbps up, which still everyone can do easily.  And about 3.2Mbps up to be a good node uploading 8X as much as you download, and dedicating only 25% of your connection to bitcoin.  I counted 40 countries out of 144 that have less than 3.2Mbps average upload speed, and none of them what I'd call "first world".
So no, bandwidth isn't an issue.  Bandwidth caps might be though, but so far they are still in the minority in the first world.

Well quadratic sighashing isn't really a big problem, because you have to be a miner to perform the attack (because nodes won't relay transactions above 100kB).  And if we have miners attacking we have worse problems than quadratic sighashing.  And malleability isn't really a huge problem either, bitcoin has survived this long with it, and there are better ways to fix it than segwit, which don't result in 5% more node resources being used.

Do you have a source for that?  Of all the costs that go into operating a large, centralized mining facility, orphan rate risk is fairly minimal.  Additionally, internet is the one cost that doesn't get more expensive in a large mining farm, you can run petahashes of miners off of the same internet connection that you run gigahashes on.  All the other costs scale up the bigger you get, electricity, labor, real estate, equipment.  Internet does not, so orphan risk is the same whether you are a small miner or a large miner.

The conspiracy theories I know of, but what are the false-facts?
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:27:36
Because like I said in the original comment, people seem to think that segwit offers an immediate doubling of the max block size.  It's not immediate, and it's not double, it's about 70%.  There are 45 million utxos.  Obviously, some of those coins are lost, or otherwise not ever moving, but those all have to be moved to segwit addresses before we get to the 70% increase.  That's about 25GB worth of blockchain transactions before the whole network is fully upgraded.
Now, it's possible that only a few services like coinbase or satoshi dice are using 75%+ of the block space currently, and if those few upgrade to segwit we could see a big increase quickly.  But I don't know if that's the case or not, and I'm not sure anyone else does either.
@_date: 2016-06-01 00:20:17
Yep, I agree.  Shilling and astroturfing have been around for a long time, but it seems like it's getting worse across the internet (not just bitcoin) in recent years.  China hiring legions of pro-gov commenters, paid per comment.  Hillary Clinton super-PAC pays people to "correct" commenters online.  CIA and NSA have documents of how to use the internet to manipulate public opinion.  Mods custom sorrting this thread.
I don't think there is a real solution to stop them.  The solution would be for each individual to disregard hive mind opinion and form your own based on substance and facts of comments.  But the fact that the hive mind exists in the first place means that's not going to happen for a majority of people, they want someone to tell them what to think instead of thinking for themselves (probably mostly out of apathy and laziness, not necessarily stupidity - I do still have some faith in internet commentors).

Right, clearly you know what you're talking about, why did you lie and say it is the "same as today"?
I'm not against segwit, I'm actually for it.  Because despite the fact that the nested P2SH segwit transactions as implemented by core are 5% larger than standard transactions, and despite the fact that it discounts these types of spam attacks, I also know that our nodes are nowhere close to being resource limited.  So these are sacrifices that are worth it for segwit, although a simple block size increase would be superior for scalability because it doesn't have these drawbacks.  
There is a lot of misinformation and straight up lies about segwit though.

That may be true, but the keyword is cheap, bitcoin is the most expensive form of data storage in the world.  ~$0.60 per kB?  You can get 10TB cloud storage for about $1200 per year.  Or about $0.00000012 per kB per year.  Making bitcoin about 7 orders of magnitude more expensive than an average tier cloud storage option.
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:07:40
4X cheaper fees for a type of 15 of 15 multisig transaction that nobody actually has a use case for except for spamming the blockchain is not the same as today.
A hard fork would be simple if people like you agreed that it's objectively the best scalability option. The quadratic sighashing problem is easily fixed by a sigops limit, as implemented a year and a half ago by [the client that automod removes if it's mentioned].

Well, if you run a segwit node then the blocks are bigger.  If you run a non-segwit node then the blocks are still max 1MB but are able to squeeze in a bunch of smaller anyone-can-spend transactions.  So you and are both right, depending on what client you run.

Well doge and lite use Scrypt for mining, not SHA256, so bitcoin ASICs will not work to mine doge and lite.  Litecoin has ~95% of the Scrypt hashing power, so it is very difficult to 51% coming from another coin's miners.  Dogecoin is able to be merged mined with any Scrypt coin, not just litecoin, so people mining Worldcoin also can mine doge too.  Will be interesting to see when litecoin halves block rewards next week if doge actually gets a larger hashrate than litecoin due to litecoin miners switching to other coins but still merge mining doge
But yeah, much fewer nodes in doge and lite.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:10:57
How do bigger blocks make that problem worse though?  I would think trying to shut out small miners with big blocks would be harder to do with big blocks than with small blocks due to network propagation time.  Just cause small miners can't download the most recent block and work on top of it on the next one fast enough?  Doesn't SPV mining solve that problem, where you just get the headers and start working on the next block before you have the most recent one completely downloaded?

I don't really see the point of BIP100's miner voting on block size limit, miners can already set their own size limit on their own blocks, most are only mining max 750kb blocks right now, not 1mb.  Whats wrong with setting the protocol limit high and letting miners decide where to put their limit themselves individually?  That's essentially what BIP 101 does.
@_date: 2015-08-08 07:42:52
The old posts still exist in reddit's database.  If you have a link to them you can still view them.  If you know the title of them you can search for them and find them.  Unless OP or mods deleted them, then they aren't indexed at all, but reddit does still have a copy of them and if you know the link you can still view the comments section.  
What you can't do is browse through back in time more than 1000 entries.  What my script does is a sort of workaround, using reddit's timestamp search function to search through all posts at given timestamp intervals, like this   
The reason it's so slow is because reddit's search will only display 25 results on a page, so if you pick an interval too long and there are more than 25 posts in that time interval, you will miss some.  So have to be conservative with the interval to ensure I get them all.  Reddit's API allows 1 request every 2 seconds, so if I set the interval to 1 hour, I can go through an hour of posts every 2 seconds, so long as there aren't more than 25.

Man, I learn something new everyday in crypto.  Thanks, that's interesting.
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:28:45
Thanks, I hadn't read the white paper since it was first published, and my understanding of cryptocurrency wasn't very good back then.  I re-read section 3 now.  A couple questions:


and (b) a cryptographic proof that an output was created in one of the blocks in the list.
How is the list of blockheaders determined?  What address does the "special" output go to, and who owns the private keys to that address, if anyone?


period, then creates a transaction on the sidechain referencing this output, providing an SPV
proof that it was created and buried under sufficient work on the the parent chain.
How does a user create a transaction on the sidechain without first having coins to transact with, or is it just a sort of beacon dummy transaction that broadcasts to the network that "See my output on the parent chain was valid, give me my coins now".  And then, where do the sidechain coins come from?  Were they created when the "special" output was created on the parent chain, and unlocked after sufficient proof?


thing as the original transfer: send the coins on the sidechain to an SPV-locked output, produce a sufficient SPV proof that this was done, and use the proof to unlock a number of previously-locked
outputs with equal denomination on the parent chain.
So the user is not getting back the same bitcoins they put in, instead it is coming from a multitude of other locked outputs?  Again, curious who controls the addresses that the outputs are in?  What exactly makes them "locked", and by what mechanism are they unlocked when a user wants them back, the act of sending to a lockbox on the sidechain is what unlocks bitcoin outputs on the parent chain?
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:38:59
Possibly.  Is anyone still mining pre-BIP 50 bitcoin, or running those nodes?
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:49:32
There are two main arguments against BIP 101's 8MB blocks.  One goes that the network of full nodes won't have enough upload bandwidth to relay 8MB blocks.  Nodes with lower upload bandwidth will leech from the network, slowing the whole thing down.  At best this would centralize functional full nodes to data centers, at worst it would create a never ending loop where the block chain gets longer and longer and nodes are never able to catch up.
The other argument is that miners with lower bandwidth will see higher orphan rates due to not being able to propagate their new blocks in time before someone else finds it and propagates it.  I don't really see this one as much of a concern, because miners can manually set their block sizes to whatever they want on an individual basis.  Just because max size is 8MB, even if there are enough txs to take up 8MB, miners with low bandwidth can simply create 1MB blocks instead if they are worried about orphans.  For example, most miners are mining max 750kb block sizes now (which is the default setting in core) as we saw during the spam attacks.  So that's really a non-issue, imo.
So to the first concern, it may be valid, it may not be.  There's no real world data, at least not that I've seen, just simulations or Gavin's initial closed network test.  The dogecoin dev team is planning such a test this coming Sunday on the dogecoin testnet.  As you know, dogecoin has max 1MB blocks every 1min, so this test will have a throughput of 15 transactions per second sustained for 1 hour, which is not dogecoin's theoretical capacity, but it's still about 5 times higher than bitcoin's.  We'll be collecting data on orphan rates, block propagation time and bandwidth usage.  If the test goes well, we'll do a larger and higher throughput test in September.  The more testnet nodes we have during the test, the more representative of a real world network it will be, we need nodes with diverse hardware and bandwidth.  So, I'd like to invite to spin up a dogecoin testnet node and participate in the upcoming test this Sunday.  More info here 
Thank you :)

Hey nullc, maybe you can answer here 
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:45:59
Dogecoin has the same 1mb block size limit as bitcoin.  But dogecoin blocks are found every 1min instead of every 10min, giving it effectively 10X the capacity (would be the same if bitcoin moved to 10mb max block size)  So yeah, doge adds blocks to the blockchain faster than bitcoin, but bitcoin has more transactions so 1 bitcoin block is larger than 10 dogecoin blocks, so bitcoin's chain grows larger in total size faster.
In terms of how centralized or decentralized it is, I'm not really sure, what metric do you measure that by?

Well, let's assume big miners have infinite upload bandwidth, just insane speeds.  They still can't upload faster than other nodes can download.  Therefore, a small miner with decent internet will still be able to get their small block propagated throughout the network faster than a big miner with big blocks and fast internet.  So the small miner still wins against an attack from a large miner with arbitrarily fast internet and arbitrarily large blocks.

The difference is back then it was many individual people mining in the same pool, like Ghash, people could switch (and they did).  Back then, ASIC manufacturers actually sold their units to consumers at a price point where the consumer could break even or maybe even earn some profit.   Nowadays there is one major company that still sells its hardware (Bitmain), the rest of these mining "pools" aren't really pools at all, they are essentially a bunch of different ASIC manufacturers solo mining.

I'll start with the definition of Bitcoin, it's quite simple, Bitcoin is the longest chain.  That is the core tenet of the protocol.  Blocks get orphaned almost every day, we don't call these blocks Bitcoin because they are on a shorter chain.  Orphaned blocks and chains are the altcoins, and the longest chain is Bitcoin.  If a small percentage of miners (&lt;50%) were mining on an orphaned chain, they wouldn't be mining Bitcoin, right?  They'd be mining an altcoin.  Do we agree?  I assume so.
Now what is BIP 101, which is implemented in XT?  BIP 101 activates when 75% of miners are using it on their node to mine with, never before.  Until then, XT nodes and Core nodes are both operating on the same chain, and both are Bitcoin.  If the 75% value is reached, BIP 101 will activate, and after two weeks has passed, Bitcoin Core users and miners will be operating on a shorter chain.  We already agreed that Bitcoin is the longest chain.
There is only one way under these obvious definitions that Bitcoin XT/BIP 101 could be considered an altcoin.  And that is if it reaches the 75% threshold, activates, and then 1/3 or more of those BIP 101 miners go back to mining with Core.  Then the longest chain would be the Core chain, with 50% or more of the miners mining on it, and XT could be considered an altcoin, an orphaned chain.

So, send bitcoin to a lockbox (is this the same as proof of burn?  If not, who controls the lockbox address?).  Now sidechain coins appear in Alice's wallet.  Where do these coins come from, are they minted right there in a coinbase transaction or do they come from somewhere else?  Now Alice wants to change sidecoin back into bitcoin, so she sends to a sidechain lockbox.  Same question, is this proof of burn, if not, who controls the lockbox address?  And now she gets bitcoin in her address.  Same question, where do these bitcoins come from, are they minted there or are they the same bitcoins she put in the lockbox to begin with, or are they different bitcoins than the ones that she sent to the lockbox initially, if they are different, where did they come from?

Fee market solution worked for real users during the attack of fake spam transactions.  Some people seem to think it will also work when the network is flooded with real transactions.  It will not, when the blocks are at capacity, someone will always be left out.  In the recent case, increasing fees meant the attacker got left out. With real volume, real people will be getting left out, which is unacceptable.

He's not talking about zero fee dust transactions, he's talking about transactions that pay a normal fee and contain loads of small outputs.  You could have 100 outputs or 1 output and still pay the same fee / kb on the transaction.  He's talking about raising the fee for the 100 outputs (if the outputs are below a certain threshold) so that they pay more than the base transaction fee / kb.

Not really, then can just manually set their own block size limit to whatever their internet can handle.  They miss out on juicy fees from larger blocks with more transactions, which is an incentive to get better internet, but as fees are still a small portion of block rewards it's not really a problem (until block rewards halve to the point where fees are significant), each miner can determine their own optimal size of blocks/cost of internet ratio.
Bigger blocks will help miners with good internet, but it won't hurt miners with bad internet.

That doesn't really make any sense, as the probability of having a solution depends on the hashrate.  A CPU of 2009 has in the range of MH/s for hashrate.  And the 32 bit nonce has 4.3 billion different options available.  Every second the timestamp changes, so you'd need 4.3 GH/s to exhaust all the header nonce options before time ran out.   A good 3 orders of magnitude more than 2009 CPUs were capable of.

@_date: 2016-02-24 19:23:17
Not as bad as saying a fraction of a percent longer block propagation time for low bandwidth miners to mine 2MB blocks causes a fraction of a percent higher orphan rate and more centralization.  Especially when there are solutions for this, such as the relay network, thin block relay, SPV mining, and miners manually setting their `blockmaxsize`.  
The block propagation problem is a linear problem, with twice as big blocks propagation takes twice as long (without using any of those solutions mentioned).
The redundant transaction broadcasting problem is an exponential problem.  The more transactions that are sitting around unconfirmed the more they have to be resent.  Every day that there is an uncleared backlog it gets worse.  Now, there's a "solution" to that too, exponentially increasing transaction fees to kick people off the network, price them out of using bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-05 00:53:41


Why do you say that?  Won't Lightning network offer a better and cheaper transaction solution once it's available?  If so, users will naturally prefer that and we may never hit the max.
The point is that the second we go over the TPS max we make it exponentially harder to run a full node.  The network spams itself as you say exponentially more as soon as we are sustained over the TPS max.  We cannot hit the max or go over it for this reason, if we do it will be catastrophic for decentralization.
Hitting max TPS leads to the data center model.

No, Segwit calls for an increase to ~1.75MB, with a potential attack vector (many high sigop transactions) of up to 4MB.


What, no you can't.  The transaction would have to be resigned if it is changed, this is something only the sender can do.


Doesn't change anything, nodes will still be bombarded and their mempool will still fill up and eventually have to eject some which will have to be resent.

They pay miners for the extra bandwidth with fees, not nodes.  Nodes just have to suck it up with no compensation.  What you quoted specifically says it must pay for its own bandwidth in addition to the original transactions bandwidth.  How is that not increasing bandwidth requirements of the network?
@_date: 2016-02-01 22:34:45
Yeah, it's going up over time because blocks are filled up.  Counter intuitively, having blocks filled up actually uses more bandwidth than if we just raised the max block size and they didn't fill up.  Because as mempools drop transactions they need to be resent, so instead of just sending once they are sent multiple times.

I'm talking about a scenario where bitcoin is trying to handle 5 tps of real usage.  It clearly cannot be done, no amount of RBF or mempool ejection or fee market can change that.

There aren't actually, if we have more transactions to be included than we have space for, then the sort of exponential memory or bandwidth use of nodes I described is inevitable.  Now, if fees rise so high that people get priced out of using bitcoin so that we never actually hit the ever increasing backlog scenario, then we'll be ok.  If you consider pricing people out of the ability to use bitcoin to be ok.  Personally I don't, however it would be better than exponential resource use of nodes.  The obvious and easy fix though is to raise the max block size.
@_date: 2016-02-24 06:41:16
Yeah, I don't expect them to follow through either.  Likely just another delaying tactic to make miners think they are on board with a block size increase to maintain their support.  But many prominent devs did sign it, and that's what was referring to I think.

Yeah, if everyone had exactly the same mempool management rules that would be true.  But mempools are a user configurable property.  You can change `minrelaytxfee`, `mempoolexpiry` and `maxmempool`.  So you end up with some nodes on the network having the transactions and some don't.  The nodes which have it will ~~continually~~ repeatedly rebroadcast it to the ones that don't, eating up the one's that have it upload bandwidth and ones that don't download bandwidth (needlessly, because the ones that don't have it will just drop it as soon as they get it).

About half of those points listed for segwit are wrong or misleading:


No, old-style transactions are still valid, meaning exchanges and other bitcoin services still have to deal with malleability.  It fixes malleability for segwit transactions only, not "once and for all".


Again, only for segwit transactions, not old-style ones.  Meaning that the quadratic sighashing attack vector still exists, segwit does not fix the vulnerability.


It's about 3.7X the number of multisig transactions per block *if all the multisig transactions are 15 of 15*.  If they are 2 of 2 (like lightning), it's only about a 2X increase.  This is actually a downside to segwit, not an upside, as it opens up a spam attack vector for someone to fill 3.7MB of block space with 15 of 15 multisig transactions while only paying transaction fees equivalent to 1MB of block space.


The whole UTXO set is not kept in memory.  You choose how much of the UTXO set is in memory with the `dbcache` setting.  Also, the way it's thought that segwit will reduce growth of the UTXO set is by discounting the fee for inputs by discounting the fee paid for signatures, and thus incentivizing people to spend their existing UTXOs instead of creating new ones.  However, it will still be cheaper to create new UTXOs than to consolidate them.  So it's unclear exactly how much segwit will reduce UTXO growth, if at all.
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:23:41
Yes, but if those outputs are so small that they can't be spent by the receiver then I believe that's what coblee is defining as spam and proposing to raise the fees on.  Outputs that are smaller than the fees themselves.

Good explanation, best I've seen, thanks.  So, question.  When bitcoin was invented, the concept of an extra nonce didn't exist.  The 4 byte nonce in the header was more than enough entropy for those low hashrates.  Adding an extra nonce in the coinbase was sort of a hack workaround that ASICs had to do because they exhaust the 4 bytes in the header nonce too quickly.  Wouldn't simply adding a few more bytes to the header nonce field put all miners back on the same playing ground, and make ASICBOOST useless?

If he were concerned with bandwidth consumption for regular node users he would advocate increasing the max block size.

At today's transaction fees of ~40,000 satoshis per kB, we would need approximately ~16MB blocks to counter the effects of the 3rd halving 5 years from now.  Historically we've seen transaction volume double about every year.  If this continues, we're on pace for ~16MB blocks 5 years from now.  
With libsecp256k1 validation (available today) time for those will be equivalent to ~2-3MB blocks today.  With thin blocks (available today), block propagation time will be equivalent to ~1-5MB blocks today.
It is NOT necessary to introduce a fee market to continue paying miners, higher transaction volume at current fee rate will be just fine.

@_date: 2016-09-23 20:04:58


Upon activation, 5% of hashpower will be mining non-segwit.  These 5% can spend segwit transactions wherever and non-segwit nodes will believe them.  So even 1 confirmation isn't safe for an old node with segwit.  Even 2 confirmations isn't safe, since it's possible for a 5% miner to get two blocks in a row.  In fact, once activated, more than 5% of hashpower can switch back to non-segwit to do this attack.  I wouldn't even be comfortable accepting 10 confirmations with a non-segwit node.
Of course, miners always have the ability to make a bad block or two, the difference with segwit is that they can apparently steal money from segwit users and convince old nodes it's valid, right now miners can't do this, they can only get sneaky with their own money.

Visa does around 2000 transactions per second.

Yeah I know, but you are still using bandwidth to receive the transaction and then boot it.  And then receive it again and boot it again.  And again.  And the node(s) that's sending it is using bandwidth to resend over and over.  You can't say "never send me that transaction again".  They are periodically resent and dropped.  The more of them that there are the greater the bandwidth leakage.  Dropping stuff from the mempool is what causes the problem, not fixes it.

I upload around that much per month with my node too.  The point is that that is not required to run a fully validating node.  The -blockonly mode allows you to use minimal bandwidth and still fully validate.  If you are on an uncapped data connection, then you can easily upload tons to the rest of the network.

Previous soft-forks didn't turn transactions into anyone-can-spend.  Yes, miners are wasting money mining invalid blocks in previous soft-forks.  But with segwit, miners can generate 1 confirmation for a segwit transaction that pays themself, and in the same block spend that to, say, an exchange like shapeshift that accepts 1 confirmation (if shapeshift is not upgraded to a segwit node).  They lose 12.5 bitcoin on the block reward, but if someone makes a 20BTC transaction with segwit and the miner can successfully double-spend a 20BTC transaction against someone, then it's a net win for the miner.
As for SPV mining, the type of mining that miners were doing that cause the fork ~2 years ago was not SPV.  It was non-validating.  With SPV mining, they are validating the headers, which is better than the no validation at all that caused the fork.  If they were doing SPV mining the fork wouldn't have happened.

The often-repeated sentiment that all the different coins are competing with each other is misleading.  We aren't competitors, we are allies.  We all have the same ideals and all use the same basic decentralized codebase, and largely we all have the same goals.  Altcoins don't detract from bitcoin's value.  There is zero evidence of that (if anyone has any evidence to the contrary I'd love to see it).  They create their own value.  Just look at dogecoin, it brought in hundreds of thousands of people into crypto who never would have been interested otherwise.  Altcoins are GOOD for bitcoin.
Edit:  People look at litecoin's $50mil marketcap and seem to think, "damn what's the point, that money should just be in bitcoin, litecoin is dumb."  It doesn't work like that, that's the same logic the MPAA uses when they look at all the piracy going on and think "Man, if piracy didn't exist all those would be sales, we're losing so much money."

No, that's not an acceptable course of action because just because the hashpower turns off doesn't mean it stops existing.  The big miners will want to sell their useless unprofitable hardware for whatever they can get for it to the highest bidder.  The only entity that would want to buy up useless hardware is likely to be someone who would want to 51% attack.  The only chance bitcoin has at avoiding this is if transaction fees begin to cover the loss in mining revenue following the unrelenting halvings.

Creating artificially large but valid blocks is not an effective attack for 2 reasons.  1, it increases block propagation time through the network, increasing chance of orphan and decreasing profitability of the attacker.  2, the targets of the attack could just download the block headers and mine on top of them directly, making the attack completely pointless to do in the first place.
An attack where miners generate invalid large blocks is a different type of attack, but of course they are disincentivised to perform it because they'd be wasting PoW time on an invalid chain.

Pools generate a block template and send that to miners to hash on.  Miners add in their own nonce locally.  When they find a nonce value that makes the block of sufficient difficulty, they submit it to the pool.  Most of these are used as "shares" so the pool can keep track of how much work each miner is doing.  Most of the shares aren't high enough difficulty to be a bitcoin block.  When a share IS found that is high enough difficulty, the pool submits it to the network, other miners and nodes verify it, it becomes a bitcoin block, the coinbase pays the block reward to the pool and the pool distributes the block reward fairly to its miners (usually taking a fee, maybe 1% or so) by how many shares each miner worker had contributed to the pool during the round.  Does that answer your question?

Most people pay a fee of around 10,000 satoshis /kb right now and they weren't paying much less before we started having issues with block size.  Most miners do ignore less than 1000 satoshi/kb, but you're right, not all.  But your transaction will take a very long time to confirm.
I think more like 400X block size and $0.01 transactions would be the best case scenario.  If fees are too high there's simply no reason to use bitcoin over the establishment, nearly instant and nearly free transactions are the entire appeal.  So if we lose those we don't get mass adoption. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 22:08:57
Alright, you're still not getting what I'm saying, I'll start from the beginning.  With large blocks in BIP 101, some people are worried that small miners with little bandwidth could be attacked by a large miner with large bandwidth by creating a (valid) block that is artificially large, filling it up all the way with transactions to self.  This would force the small miner to download it, and while it's downloading small miner wouldn't be able to mine on the longest chain.  However, this attack is not viable due to the existence of SPV mining, since the small miner doesn't have to download the full block to continue mining on the longest chain.  Further, the existence of SPV mining actually disincentivises the attack because their artificially large block will take a much longer time to propagate through the network and is more likely to be orphaned.  So they would be increasing their orphan rate attempting an attack that doesn't work anyway.  Therefore, this hypothetical attack is not a viable strategy and shouldn't be used as an argument against BIP 101.
@_date: 2015-09-21 18:02:59
Yeah, basically we hope there's no collusion, that no malicious entity or group controls 51% or more of the hashpower, that there are lots of competing mining companies.  This is a very old concern that Satoshi talked about in the white paper itself.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:28:43
I'm not here to argue the benefits or disadvantages of altcoins, I'm here to argue the advantages of larger blocks as proposed by BIP 101.  You're saying 1mb blocks keep bitcoin resistant to regulation while somehow larger blocks don't.  And now we've come full circle.
@_date: 2015-09-03 19:39:51
Yes, I know almost no one wants to keep 1mb blocks.  The tiny minority happen to be the core devs apparently since they are rejecting every proposal to increase.
Lightning is far more centralized than bitcoin, at least it would be if it existed.  You have to have a huge amount of capital to run a payment hub, much more than running a bitcoin node (like orders of magnitude more).  Interestingly, increasing the cost of running a bitcoin node is one of the same arguments that some supporters of lightning use against the idea to increase block size.
Sidechains quite literally are altcoins with a 2-way peg to bitcoin's blockchain.  They are mined separately (unless auxpow is implemented), they have a separate blockchain and a separate network of nodes and potentially operate under separate rules for consensus.  The two way peg ties their value to bitcoin, but that is the only thing that makes them any different from an altcoin.  Someone very cleverly decided to name it a sidechain instead.
Edit: to be clear, I want lightning.  I want sidechains.  I want bigger blocks.  These things are all separate things, not mutually exclusive at all.

Why in the world would you SPV mine on top of an SPV block?  There's no advantage to doing that, an SPV block is tiny with one transaction and easily propagated, so no reason to SPV mine it, you get no advantage of faster download times.


Doing so means wasting precious PoW time to create an invalid chain, there is a financial incentive for large miner to mine the correct chain.

Sorry, to clarify, I wasn't suggesting small miners with low bandwidth should always use SPV mining, I was suggesting it as a strategy a small miner could use to continue mining valid blocks while under attack from a large miner generating artificially large blocks to try to force out small miners.  That SPV mining exists means the attack wouldn't work.
And yes, as block rewards get smaller and smaller transaction fees will have to make up a larger and larger portion of revenue.  I don't see how keeping blocks small would solve that problem, it makes it worse.  It either means far fewer fees or far larger fees, neither are good for the health of the ecosystem.  As halvings continue we must allow for more transactions to keep fees low and mining profitable or else we wind up with a lot of hashpower sitting around unused and stagnating development of more efficient ASICs.
Edit: clarify

If you're trying to bandwidth-DoS attack a node by sending transactions at it then you're doing it wrong.  Perhaps it would be an effective means to DoS the entire bitcoin network, but there are far better ways to target an individual node.  I think bandwidth "leak" would be a better term for what you describe than "attack".  Even that's sort of pushing it, it's more of a tradeoff, use more bandwidth in return for more free memory.

*  20% of miners can decrease the block size limit if they want and destroy bitcoin.  This introduces a vulnerability that didn't exist before.  51% can already destroy bitcoin, why lower that number to 21%?
*  it is NOT easy for anyone to buy an ASIC and participate. The best ASIC out is the antminer s7 and costs $2000, it has a 50% chance to find a single block in 1 year, and thus it can't meaningfully participate in voting.  It is prohibitively expensive for anyone except the ultra-wealthy to cast a vote on the blockchain, putting more power into their hands while taking it away from average users.  Bitcoin of course, promises to do the opposite.
*  Miners are not the only parties invested into bitcoin's success, in fact their business model is all about short term profit, they have to squeeze as much money out of their machines as possible before they go obsolete.  Do we really want businesses focused on short term profits to be able to decide any core part of the protocol?  Especially one that affects their business profitability directly?
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:20:06
Yes, you bring up a good point about the block reward.  I've seen the unrelenting halving schedule crush hashrate in dogecoin (77 day halvings) first hand.  The only solution to the problem I can see for bitcoin is mainstream adoption, many on-chain transactions to allow the miners some profit through fees.  Small blocks simply won't let the amount of transactions needed happen.  And the "solution" of increasing fees through a fee market is terrible.  It would destroy bitcoin if transactions cost $1 or more.  The entire point of bitcoin is that anyone can use it far more cheaply than banks/credit cards/paypal with their huge transaction fees.
And yes, I realize that SPV mining is not a real solution, but it is a solution if you are a small miner struggling to be profitable.  It will allow them to still find valid blocks under an attack from larger miners generating large blocks with fake transactions to force out small miners.  That SPV mining exists makes that attack vector for large miners to gain more control infeasible.
@_date: 2015-09-15 13:46:09
Even at $1 fee per transaction (ridiculously high fee, bitcoin is unusable for small transactions and worse than PayPal and visa for all but &gt;$200 transactions) miners would only be making about 25% more revenue than they are now with full 1MB blocks and $1 per transaction.  Miners need larger blocks too to be able to have more transactions rather than larger fees per transaction.


Miners can enforce a minimum fee by not including anything with less into the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:54:57
Actually it's not a fact, it's false.  As I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, if the problem is that miners don't have enough bandwidth to upload a larger block then they can simply not mine large blocks, they can set their own individual mining limit as most do now, most mine at 750kb blocks as that's the default soft-limit.  If the problem is that they don't have enough download bandwidth to get large blocks, they can simply download the headers and start mining on top of the latest large block before completing its full download, SPV mining exists.
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:40:21


There is no way governments can force that without 51% control of the miners.  Whether it's achieved through regulation or literally buying the miners is semantics.

By shorting bitcoin, do you mean selling all your holdings for USD or whatever fiat, attacking to cause FUD and hope that causes the price to drop, then buying up more bitcoin than you had to begin with your USD and hoping price recovers once you stop the attack?  If so, I feel like there are far better ways miners could create FUD by disrupting the network than making big blocks, such as confirming double spends and causing a temporary fork.  Or selfish mining and causing a temporary fork.  


Then they are creating blocks that they know will be orphaned, and as I mentioned there is already a financial disincentive to waste PoW time on an invalid chain (unless of course you own 51% of the mining power, in which case you are doing a 51% attack).  The attack you are describing is something that can be done today irrespective of bigger blocks, but it isn't done because of the financial disincentive.

You use that word fact but I don't think you know what it means.  Lightning network is trustless, yes, but that doesn't mean it's decentralized.  Payment hubs would need a large amount of capital, many orders of magnitude more than running a full node, to operate making them inherently centralized.
It is not a fact at all that the blockchain can't be scaled larger, it's never been tested, it's all theoretical and academic, the fact is that we don't know if it can or will scale because it is in the future and you can't predict the future.  Allowing larger blocks now will let us find out, if there are any problems we can always soft-fork lower which is far easier than hard-forking higher if there are problems with it being to high.

@_date: 2015-09-03 12:12:22
Me too.  To the criticism that large blocks could be made by big miners with high bandwidth to force small miners to download them, SPV mining exists, miners only need the block headers to mine on top of a block.  To the criticism that miners would need high upload bandwidth to get their blocks out on time, they could simply configure to mine smaller blocks at whatever individual limit they choose for their own operation.  To the criticism that nodes can't handle the bandwidth, we just had a stress test in dogecoin where we reached 30 transactions per second with absolutely no problem at all (doge has 1mb blocks every 1min).  Bitcoin can easily support much larger blocks.  To the criticism that 8GB is too high, well, it's better to shoot for too high and then soft-fork lower than it is to shoot too low and hard-fork higher, soft forks are much easier to pull off.

You don't own an address or hot wallet or anything, they keep track of your user account funds off chain.  If you sent the coins to the address they provided they have their own record of it.  You shouldn't expect coins to stay in there.
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:25:10


Adding a new address to watch-only requires a rescan, which can take a long time.  And you might not necessarily want to send payment to an address in your node's wallet with `getnewaddress` since keeping funds in a hot wallet like that generally isn't recommended.  One example of a merchant use for querying an address balance might be if they wanted to incorporate multisig for their customers, sort of like how openbazaar does.  Customer would create a 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 multisig with the merchant's pubkey and fund it, and merchant would `decodescript` to validate the redeemscript but merchant couldn't see when the address was funded without adding to watch-only and rescanning.  But yeah, in general it shouldn't be necessary for most use cases.

I think we can answer that question better with empirical data next summer after the next halving.  When we see how much hashrate decreases compared to however much block rewards are worth then.  A safe assumption is that miners will not continue to mine if they can't do it profitably.  With litecoin 3 weeks ago we got to watch their first halving.  To my surprise, their hashrate hardly decreased at all, 5% or less despite a fairly flat price of LTC.  I can only assume that means that mining litecoin is still profitable despite the reward halving (it must have been incredibly profitable before it).
I suspect bitcoin miners are operating on a much smaller profit margin and I think we'll be able to see exactly what that is after the halving.  Then the only unknown will be the pace of ASIC development.  If better ASICs keep getting made then we don't have much to worry about since the machines that get turned off after a halving will be obsolete.  
Sorry I'm sort of rambling.  To answer your question I don't think there should be a forced relationship between block size and transaction fees.  I think in an ideal world blocks are always as large as they need to be to process all transactions in 10min (like it has been for the previous 6 years)  And we have enough transactions that the minimum fee enforced by miners (at present 1000 satoshis, but they may very well make it higher) will be enough to make up for the loss of block rewards.  IF we have enough transactions (and it's a big if) then I think it will be very good for miners and for the health of bitcoin to have the majority of their income coming from fees.  Then they have the prospect of increasing rewards over time rather than halving block rewards, which I imagine would be very good for miners and ASIC development and spur more competition.
Ultimately though there's just not a precedent in cryptocurrency where we've seen high enough adoption for transaction fees to become a majority of miner revenue.  We have seen block reward halvings almost destroy a coin before without associated transaction fees (dogecoin had an accelerated halving schedule and it's being kept alive by 5 billion coin annual inflation and merge mining, neither are an option for bitcoin.)
Assuming we get a high enough adoption to have tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands in a block, the scary point will be the crossover point where fees become the majority of miner revenue.  I expect that point will be a very uncertain time for the mining industry and our hashrate will be the lowest then (or not lowest, but most decreasing, you know what I mean).

Ok, so long as you are summoning them.  My main concern with lightning is that is it not decentralized and it is offchain, not that it is not trustless.  That payment hubs will need a large amount of capital to handle a lot of transactions.  I also haven't heard exactly what a payment hub's incentive to run is, I presume they charge transaction fees?  I don't know.  I do wish nodes in bitcoin had some incentive to run, so it's not something I'm necessarily against.
ANYWAY, my concern is that if there are transaction fees in lightning, then it will take away from transaction fees for bitcoin miners.  Bitcoin will continue halving, that's a given.  The hope is that transaction fees one day will be enough to incentivize miners to mine so the hashrate doesn't drop dangerously low.  Lightning moving transactions offchain seems to take away those fees for miners.  Since only about 1% of bitcoins will be left to mine by 2030, we're gonna need some transaction fees to keep them going.

Not true.  Thought I explained why, but let me try again.  If we have 10,000 transactions with a fee of 10,000 satoshi each then we have 1 BTC worth of transaction fees.  A miner mines this.  Whoops!  The miner's block got orphaned, damn that sucks.  Oh, but the block that got accepted instead included those transactions and that miner reaped the fee.  We have still contributed 1 BTC to the mining industry.

I'm about to get off my PC, so I don't have a lot of time right now, but I'll respond to a few now.


It will be the limiting factor when demand for blockchain space exceeds space available too.  Unlike a spam attack, increased real transactions don't ever stop, so the potential is there for it to be much worse than a spam attack.  The only solution I've heard from 1MB proponents is to increase minrelaytxfee, thereby increasing fees and introducing a fee market.  Taking away potential revenue from miners and giving users who pay too little a very bad user experience, since their transaction will never confirm.  I really dislike the fee market solution.


~~Since nodes are limited by RAM, not bandwidth I believe increasing the max block size will help with decentralization in the case of limited block space, not hurt it.~~  edit:  just realized you were talking about mining centralization, not node centralization.  I think big blocks are great for mining decentralization because they are able to earn more in fees.  With 1MB blocks and no fee market (already explained why i dont like fee market) the block reward dwindles, miners will become more and more competitive for fewer and fewer profits.  Eventually only a lucky few due to geography and circumstance are able to mine profitably.  On the contrary, with BIP 101 miners are able to face the prospect of increasing rewards rather than constantly decreasing.  This would make more miners able to be profitable with the prospect of actually getting more rewards in the future rather than less for the first time ever.  And we would see much more decentralization in mining than ever before since the CPU/GPU days.


SPV mining led to a problem during a soft fork.  It happens all the time today, almost 10% of blocks are SPV mined.  Besides, I'm not advocating for its use, I'm just saying the fact that it exists means that attack vector isn't viable.


As far as I know, most of North America, Europe, East and Southeast Asia (excluding China and Australia) don't have bandwidth caps.  No idea about South America or Africa.  If you have some data on how many people in the world have data caps to their home connection I'd love to see it.

I have a beef with anyone who wants a fee market to force non-blockchain transactions, blockstream just happens to be leading the charge there.  Seriously, how does a fee market solve anything?  We have real users wanting to make real transactions who just can't.  The solution "just pay a higher fee" doesn't work for everyone, it can't when there isn't enough space to go around.  How is it ok that some people are priced out of using the blockchain?

Oh, we're talking about two different things.  I was saying optimistically that blockchain transactions would need more space on the block chain.  You're saying that technology won't be able to handle that, if true.  Please refer to point 2 in my OP.


If miners disliked BIP 101 after implementing that would mean that somehow they were less profitable under it.  I don't see how that would be the case.  But if it were, can you explain why miners would not support a soft-fork to a lower max block size limit?


Not sure why said that you support bigger blocks then, sounds like you support smaller blocks.


Setting a fee market when there are more real transactions than we have space for is not a viable growth solution.  Some people will get priced out of transaction no matter what with a fee market.  It inhibits bitcoin's growth, no two ways about it.  There are more transactions than can be included on the blockchain.  Miners should decide based on transaction fees what goes there and what doesn't.  Not nodes.

The bandwidth argument I made obviously made many assumptions.  The point of it isn't that literally 2 billion people could run a bitcoin full node with 90MB blocks.  The point is to show how little bandwidth is actually required.  The 1 peer model obviously wouldn't work in reality, there will be leechers (downloading more than they upload) and there will be seeders (uploading more than they download).  If all the kinks were worked out in terms of overhead (getting/sending the same transaction multiple times, relaying orphan blocks, handshakes with peers, no light clients etc..) then we get a global figure similar to what I showed.  Thought that was clear, sorry if it wasn't.  Anyway, how much of the world do we need to run nodes?  Clearly we don't need 2 billion nodes.  Would the top 0.01% of the world's best bandwidth connections with 200,000 nodes suffice or would that be too centralized?


Yes, down the road when transaction fees become significant that might seem to be a problem.  In the short term it is not a problem.  And in the long term, block rewards being mostly transaction fees in a growing economy will give miners the prospect of actually having increasing block rewards rather than constantly decreasing.  This will have a very strong decentralization effect.


My opinion is that if it pays a fee that miners are willing to mine, then it is not spam.  Bitcoin is decentralized and open, anyone can use it for whatever they want so long as they pay the fee like everyone else.  By any other definition, defining some transactions that miners are willing to mine are spam, and other transactions that miners are willing to mine are not spam is centralization.  Some other entity gets to decide whether my transaction is spam?  Leave it up to the miners, that is how the system is meant to work.


Many have much faster blocks which is why I said "effectively larger".  1MB blocks every 1min are basically the same thing as 10MB blocks every 10min.

The numbers I picked were made up of course.  I'll make up new numbers.  If 2,000 transactions pay 0.11 BTC each then miners get 222 BTC.  And if the 8000 transactions that couldn't be included were trying to pay 0.1 BTC each then miners miss out on 800 BTC.  A fee market cannot increase miner revenue.  I thought this was obvious, is this something a lot of the small block people think?

I'm being ridiculous on purpose to explain why sidechains are not bitcoin and are in fact altcoins.  When you are logical about it you realize that sidechains are a special type of altcoin that has its value pegged to bitcoin's.  If I created something, anything, say a fancy origami flower, and said "this will always be worth 1 bitcoin, I will always give you 1 bitcoin for it" would that mean it is the same thing as bitcoin?  If your answer is yes then I understand why you think sidechains are bitcoin.

Cutting the gas limit is a band-aid to a gaping wound.  The gaping wound is that certain CPU intensive transactions are possible that don't need to pay a higher fee.  That's what the attacker is exploiting.  The fix is to reject such transactions that don't pay a fair fee for the amount of resources they use.  Cutting the gas limit is not a fix, it's a band-aid until the real issue is resolved.
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:37:48
No fees do not become too low, as I explained earlier.  Including a transaction carries with it a risk of orphan.  If the loss of profit due to orphan risk is higher than the transaction fee paid, then the transaction will not be included.  This means there is an economical minimum fee that transactions must pay.
Now, how does mining 2,000 transactions generate more revenue than mining 10,000 transactions, given that there is a minimum transaction fee?

Woah.  Wait a minute, why is this not a thing?  Why couldn't miners submit the same work to multiple pools to get multiple shares for the same work?

I wasn't aware of that.  What does Luke propose then?  There are several devs (I won't name names) who have expressed opposition to all increase proposals.  Regardless, minimal increases like 17.7% per year, or 2MB once don't solve the problem, so I lump those in with small block proponents.


Core proposed a dynamic minrelaytxfee.  When network usage is high, minrelaytxfee will increase, and has a half-life for decrease once usage is normal again.  This is a good solution to spam attacks.  But it is not a solution to increased real demand for block space.  It creates a fee market for users.  When real demand for block space exceeds the available block space, a fee market is not a solution.  There is only so much block space to go around.  An individual user can increase their fees to get included, yes.  But another user gets left out in that scenario.  This is why I dislike a fee market.  Miners should decide what fee they are willing to include in a block, nobody else.


Totes, thanks


No, some users are getting priced out of creating a transaction necessarily because there is not enough room for everyone.  Miners are losing those fees.


Good question, thanks for asking.  By including a transaction in a block a miner is increasing their risk of orphan and therfore their revenue by some small percent.  If the transaction doesn't pay a large enough fee to overcome that loss incurred by propagating extra data, then the transaction will not be included.  This means there is a minimum fee a transaction must pay to get included in a block.  Infinite block size does not mean 0 transaction fee.  I would like to add, that just because a single miner's revenue might decrease from orphan rate of bigger blocks, that does not mean miners revenue as a whole decreases with bigger blocks, on the contrary.  A block gets orphaned because another miner took those fees, so they are not lost.


Granted I don't have proof, but when an industry is booming with increased revenue you have many more small players and start ups looking to take a cut of the pie.  When an industry is stagnant or decreasing the small guys get priced out by the behemoths.  But I'm not an economist.

A fee market where some some transactions are priced out decreases miner revenue, not increases it.  How could excluding some transactions possibly increase their revenue?  If some transactions don't pay a worthy fee then miners won't include them anyway

I really do get tired of all the analogies.  As a newbie they just confused me.  As a veteran they seem pointless.  Bitcoin is far easier to understand than any other currency, reserve, stock or commodity.  It only seems complex in comparison because we oversimplify these other things.  Just understand what a transaction is, how the blockchain works and how mining secures it and you understand bitcoin.  There's like a million layers to understanding our current system, fractional reserve banking, the federal reserve and debt limits, NYSE is run by closed source bots and 1ms less latency to the servers costs millions of dollars.  Although it seems complicated at first, bitcoin is an extremely simple and elegant solution to an otherwise convoluted monetary system.

Oh I think I see what you're saying.  That since there will be $500,000 fewer bitcoins being sold on the market everyday from miners, that the price should increase by $500,000 every day presuming the same number of buy orders?  It doesn't work like that.  The trade volume number is always in equilibrium.  You can't have a trade without a buyer and a seller.  And there are always far, far more buy orders and sell orders than $500,000 in any given day, the number of those is called the order depth of the market, it's not the same as the volume.  Volume refers to amount of buy/sell transactions only.

It's true that the model breaks down as the subsidy approaches 0.  That doesn't make it any less relevant when the subsidy is medium-large.
FWIW, 0 subsidy in a fee market with 1MB blocks (assuming mining is a zero-sum-game) would mean every transaction (average 500B) would have to pay ~$4 fee for miners to get the same revenue they do today.  That fee is obviously too large (maybe we can agree on that or maybe we can't), people won't be willing to pay it, so many miners will have to shut down which of course increases centralization.
Which kind of centralization is worse with 0 subsidy, unlimited blocks or 1MB blocks?  With 1MB blocks we would have to know what the average fee is people are willing to pay per transaction (average tx 500B).  So we can plug in some numbers.  If they only pay $1 instead of $4, then we get 4X more centralization than we have today.  With unlimited blocks, it's a lot harder to determine because the model breaks down at 0 subsidy.
If instead we assume that people will be willing to pay a 20,000 satoshi fee per kB regardless (maybe even make it a rule), as they do today, then we need 62.5MB blocks (full of transactions) to have miners make as much revenue as they do today.  My meager 5Mbps up internet connection can upload that in 39 seconds, I imagine in 2140 when the block subsidy reaches 0 we'll all have much faster internet.

The fee market already exists because miners will not include a transaction that pays a fee that is less than what they might lose due to orphan risk.
The risk of orphan does not decrease revenue for the mining industry because when a block gets orphaned another block is accepted.
Risk of orphan does not decrease mining revenue for the industry.   Risk of orphan does decrease mining revenue for an individual miner.  That's why there will always be a minimum transaction fee.  
Larger blocks will increase miner revenue if the demand for block space exists.  Smaller blocks will decrease miner revenue if the demand for block space exists.

I would personally be fine with a no cap proposal, but none have been written up or gained any following.  I believe the miners are capable of deciding what size blocks they want to mine.  They will mine larger blocks if the transaction fees they gain from it are greater than the loss of profit due to increased risk of orphan from propagating a large block.  Miners won't mine huge blocks if they have a disincentive to do so, and they will if they have an incentive.  And that's the way it should be, imo.

The definition of inflation according to a quick google search is:  


When we talk about it in terms of traditional economies, yes it is usually due to a government printing more money, but that's the cause of the inflation, not inflation itself.  Bitcoin is highly volatile,  increases and decreases in value are caused by far more factors than just how much of it is created, unlike the USD.

They are just priced out.  They can't participate.   If they could, then they could give more fees to miners.  But they can't.  If we had 5 transactions and only 4 could be included then it doesn't matter what fee those 4 pay, the fifth's can't be included.

Orphans are a reality, they are built in to the way the system works.  We aren't "using" them for anything.  They need not be pushed to the limit.  Miners will decide what size blocks they want to mine.  It is not a dangerous idea and it does not cause centralization.  If and when fees matter, miners will be facing the prospect of an increasing block reward rather than a constantly decreasing one which help with decentralization more than anything else.
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:09:50
Luke!  So glad you responded, thank you :)


You didn't explain why.


Funny how you make that argument with this soft fork and no other.  Something that miners agree is beneficial to them is bad for bitcoin.  Not sure I follow since bitcoin depends on miners.


Can you explain why every node in the network would have to upload every transaction and block 7 or 8 times?  Let's say we have 100 nodes.  Why would all 100 nodes need to upload 7 or 8 times more than they upload?  If a block of 10MB existed, uploading it 7.5 times would result in 7,500MB uploaded, while only 750MB were used by the network.  Wouldn't that be redundant?  We only need a 1:1 upload:download ratio to work, this is self evident.


SPV mining is a reality whether we like it or not.  What size blocks do you propose instead?


Thought I explained, this attack doesn't work and in fact is disincentivized due to the existance of SPV mining.


As I explained elsewhere, in response to eragmus I think, miners should be able to mine whatever they want.  If it pays a large enough transaction fee that it is profitable to mine, then it should be mined.  Saying otherwise is centralization, why should someone other than a miner get to say whether my transaction gets mined or not?  Yes, nodes are free to set their own policies, agree with you 100% there.


No, it would not break the network to the point of being unusable.  I can make claims without any evidence to back them up too!

Oh, thanks.  I believe that constantly falling mining revenue (due to halvings) will cause centralization.  With less and less revenue to be had, only the most efficient will be able to mine profitably.  If miners could have an increasing revenue through transaction fees I think we would see more miners able to be profitable and less centralization.

I agree, I think almost everyone acknowledges that max block size needs to be increased.  The small block camp I was referring to are the ones who don't acknowledge that who think there's nothing wrong with a fee market and tell node operators to set mintxrelayfee higher.  I also would think it was being disingenuous if it weren't multiple core developers saying it.
If 75% isn't enough for a hard fork, then how much is enough? 100% isn't possible, not in a decentralized environment, one person, any person, could say no, so that's akin to saying hard forks should never happen (should hard forks ever happen?).  85-99%, likewise, gives one person (a pool operator) the power to say no.  75% gives that veto power to 2 people instead, yay decentralization.  This is the bitcoin we have, like it or not.
As for urgency, we all have access to the same data so we can draw our own conclusions about when it's needed   I would prefer to fork before it's needed, but I understand that sometimes only a crisis can motivate a significant change.

What about in a year or so when transactions will always be occurring more quickly than they are being included in blocks?  This is being sold to us as a spam preventative measure today.

This is deeply related to the block size issue.

Looking forward to it.  I hope the BIP addresses what I see as a fundamental flaw in sidechains, that they transfer the value of a bitcoin to a blockchain that doesn't have the same security as Bitcoin's.

Namecoin has an incentive for miners to merge-mine it, and even it barely has a quarter of bitcoin's hashrate.

To clarify, soft fork segwit uses the coinbase field for the witness commitment, which is already used by miners as an extra nonce, as a place to signal who they are (I.e how we know which pool mined a given block), as a spot for AuxPoW proofs, and the location that satoshi famously wrote "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" in the genesis block.  It's used for many things already, and may have many more uses in the future.
Hard fork segwit creates a new field in the block header specifically for witness commitments so that it doesnt infringe on space already allocated as the coinbase.
Just for those who don't know what you were talking about, was quite vague.

In the military there's a saying "don't bring me a problem without also bringing a solution" with the connotation that unless there's something we can do about it then we don't care.  Peter Todd is just rehashing well known properties of SPV, everyone already knows they depend on full nodes being honest, he's not saying anything new.  He might as well say "Proof of work is vulnerable if 51% of the miners collude".  Yes, we know, not very helpful.

I was using maxconnections=2 since that's the only way we have to limit or control our bandwidth usage right now.  The top comment was asking for bandwidth control similar to bittorrent.  If we had that, we could have 50 connections and limit to 103.7GB and not be harming the network with 6MB blocks.  I already explained that, please don't dwell on the maxconnections hack.  
If there is significant overhead, give me an estimate.  Orphan blocks, duplicate transactions, pinging peers, and SPV wallets would all be pretty negligible I think.  
Orphan blocks might be an extra 2%, I don't know about duplicate transactions, pinging peers is nothing, SPV wallets are nothing since they only need 80 bytes per block.

If it's double the current average fee then miners gain no extra revenue from keeping blocks 1MB instead of mining 2MB blocks.
In fact, they will get less.  Because fewer people will be willing to transact with bitcoin with higher fees, or they will make fewer but larger transactions, so they lose potential transactions.
@_date: 2016-05-31 22:42:38
12% couldn't hurt.  It's only 12% because bitcoin blocks are constantly full and transaction relay overhead takes up a lot of bandwidth due to inefficiencies.  Transactions get rebroadcasted repeatedly if they have not been mined, whereas blocks are only ever relayed once (well, unless you are helping a new node get synced).
Giving manual control to node operators over bandwidth usage such as unlimited and xt 11e do is obviously the best solution, allot however much bandwidth you want/can afford to the client.  Like maybe lowering priority of transaction relay while increasing priority of block relay, so that you have analog control instead of just the binary option of -blocksonly or not.

That's the part I was asking about.  Surely it's not an infinite number since that would imply transactions are taking 0 bytes.

And if it doesn't, then presumably lightning network will have the same entry barrier to running a channel that running a bitcoin full node would have and therefore doesn't solve scalability or network centralization any more than increasing block size.

Why does everyone think block reward halving halves the supply on the market?  ~80,000 bitcoins are traded on markets every day (that's 80,000 being bought and 80,000 being sold).  About 3600 bitcoins are mined everyday (with 25btc block reward).  Let's assume 100% of those are sold on the market.  That's 4.5% of the market supply, which would get reduced to 2.25% of the market supply after halving.  So we can expect, mathematically, a maximum of 2.25% increase in market price, assuming exchange volume (demand) stays the same.
Before anyone says "that's 2.25% per day" - no it isn't.  Do that same calculation per hour, per week, per month, per year and it still comes out to 2.25%, it is not a per unit of time number.

Per any unit of time.  Over a year, if trading volume averages the same $61 million per day, and mining rewards obviously stay the same, then it's still 2% per year.  The time unit cancels out of the equation.  % is a unit-less number, since it's calculated by dividing two numbers with the same units by each other (in this case traded btc/day divided by mined btc/day)

Let's do the math.
* 2MB X 6blocks/h X 24h X 30d = 8.64GB per month.
* Since you'll need to download and upload that many transactions as well as their blocks, 8.64 X 4 = 34.56GB per month to not be a leech, to just be a neutral node (not helping, not hurting the network).
* You could add 4 connections to that to upload to for 2 X 8.64GB X 4 connections = 69.12GB per month.
* Running with `-maxconnections=5` will use 34.56GB + 69.12GB = 103.7GB per month.  
* If EVERY block was 2MB for the whole month you could still contribute 4X more to the network than you leech while using only 100GB of bandwidth.  
* With 6MB blocks you would use 6MB X 6blocks/h X 24h X 30d = 25.92GB.  You would need to download and upload the blocks and transactions at least once, so 25.92 X 4 = 103.7GB per month.  If we had full 6MB blocks you could run a "neutral" node with `maxconnections=2` that neither helps nor harms the network for 103.7GB per month in bandwidth.

I've addressed all of the parent's concerns elsewhere in this thread.
About Lightning.  Yes, I understand it.  Payment hubs will need a large reserve of bitcoin to function as a buffer.  That's centralization.  Yes, anyone can open a payment channel, but they still need btc.  Pure speculation on my part here:  Blockstream will choose default paths through lightning that use the oldest and most trusted hubs.  Sounds great.  But those hubs are sure to be owned by blockstream since they are developing it.  Lightning network will of course include fees through each channel a transaction travels, they've said so.  Bitcoin miners don't see any of this unless a fee market is enforced in which case ordinary users are being forced onto lightning instead of the blockchain because it is cheaper.

Huh?  We're using the term inflation loosely here, inflation refers to a decrease in ~~price~~ value of a currency.

Coins getting sold on the market can lead to a decrease in value and thus you have inflation.  What I'm saying is that the amount of mined bitcoins getting sold on the market is minuscule compared to total market trading activity, therefore fewer bitcoins being mined won't have a drastic effect on price.

How much exactly do you expect price to increase?  Today's mining reward for a block is 25 X 290 = $7250.  Do you expect 1 satoshi to be worth that in 2140?  If so, then bitcoin's market cap is 7250 X 21,000,000 X 100,000,000 = $15,225,000,000,000,000,000.  The wealth of everyone in the world combined today is ~241,000,000,000,000.  So about 6.2 million times what the entire earth's wealth is worth.
Basic arithmetic tells us even in a best case scenario if 100% the world's wealth were in bitcoin, then 1 bitcoin would be worth $11,500,000.  To keep today's same block reward at that price (with no transaction fees), miners would have to be mining at least 0.00063000 BTC per block, 63,000 satoshis.  Which gets us no further than halving 16 in 2072 in a best case scenario.

Hmm, well a couple extra seconds generating a new block template after a new block comes in means miners will be mining on the old invalid template for those couple seconds, right? If they find a block during that time it will be orphaned.  Maybe you're right it shouldn't affect orphan rate of blocks, but it would cause a higher rate of orphan shares in PPLNS pools.  Most I think are generating a new block template every 20-60sec or so, so a couple extra seconds distributing new work to miners causes more orphan shares.  Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.  Anyway long getblocktemplate latency is bad for miners haha.

Ignoring the obvious problem of computing all those keys, you would need to store 2^160 private keys, each are 256 bits of information.  That's 3.75 X 10^50 bits of info.  Or about 10^40 1TB hard drives.  Or, if you had a magical way of using 1 atom of iron to represent 1 bit of data it would require about 47 Pluto masses worth of iron to make a hard drive to store that many bits.  The word "astronomical" is not an exaggeration in this scenario.

The reason merchants use 3rd party services for payments is because they are easy.  Using bitcoin core for it is hard.
*  The various wrappers in different languages for the bitcoind API are often poorly documented.  And there are lots of different options to choose from and it's hard to know which one to pick.
* It's not immediately obvious how to link a shopping cart checkout page to your bitcoind instance without custom code.  Most merchants aren't programmers.
* Bitcoin core's RPC lacks some basic functionality, such as querying the balance of an address that is not in your wallet or on your watch-only list.
* When monitoring a large number of address (a couple hundred thousand either in your wallet or on your watch-only list) bitcoin core runs extremely sluggishly or just crashes.
* Also, obviously, bitcoin core does not have the ability to autoconvert payments to fiat, you'd have to write your own program hooking up to an exchange API to do that.
This is why serious payment processors developed their own full node client with enhanced capabilities (Coinbase uses Toshi, Bitpay uses Bitcore, for example).
But bitcore (not to be confused with bitcoin core) is open source and anyone can use that, which is what I'd recommend to merchants wanting to process their own transactions.

Please read what I wrote again.  I included the blocks and transactions in the calculation.  It's very simple math.  With your examples they wouldn't need to sacrafice 100%, they would need to sacrafice less than 3%.  Do I need to show my work there too?  I hope you can follow along.
5Mbps is capable of transferring 5Mbps / 8bits X 60sec X 60min X 24h = 450GB per day.  With full 8MB blocks, relaying transactions and blocks to 5 peers uses about 16MB X 5 peers X 6blocks/h X 24h = 11.52GB per day.  11.52/450 = 2.56% of your home connection.

A new point.  I guess.  I thought it was obvious.  If we have 10,000 transactions looking to get confirmed but only 2,000 can be included then miners are missing out on 8,000 transaction fees.  Let's say those 2,000 that they do include pay 0.1 BTC each.  Miners get 200 BTC worth of transaction fees.  Let's say the 8,000 they don't include were trying to pay 0.01 BTC each.  Miners are missing out on 80 BTC worth of transaction fees.

Fee market and block subsidy is something I've thought a lot about actually.  A cent or two extra won't do anything for miners with 1MB blocks.  If transactions were $1/kB they'd make an extra $1000 per block which by halving number 3 at 6.25BTC/block would be about 40% of their revenue (assuming constant BTC price of course), so that might be workable.  I know I definitely won't be using bitcoin if I have to pay a dollar for the privilege to write 1kB of data, would anyone?  Or would they just move to a cheaper network, like Visa, Paypal or Litecoin?  
Decentralization and scalability are important, but the MOST important thing of all is blockchain security.  There is only one solution to the problem of ever decreasing block rewards, and that is substantially increased number of transactions per block.  This is the main reason I am skeptical of Lightning, if no one is using the blockchain anymore mining incentive vanishes along with the halvings and then of course we have exahashes worth of useless equipment lying around that will get sold to the highest bidder.  By the way (not that you said this, but) it is a myth that price automatically doubles with halvings to make up for miners' lost revenue, I wrote a bit about that [here](
With 40MB blocks at the current standard fee of 10,000 satoshi (~$0.025) we allow for that same $1000 in fees per block.  From purely a mining and blockchain security persepective, I think a minimum block size of somewhere around 40MB is needed.  Obviously a couple extra cents in fees or whatever would make slightly lower workable too.  Although if it were larger it would be even healthier for the ecosystem, because then we might even see an *increasing* incentive to mine rather than a decreasing one.
I don't care what the final solution to the block size debate is so long as it gets us near 40MB blocks within a decade.  I find both BIP 101 and BIP 100 to be workable though each have drawbacks, but those are the only two acceptable solutions we have right now from my point of view.  Would love to hear more ideas.  Mine is a mashup of, I think it was Back's 2-4-8 and I think Pieter's adding on the 17% annual increase.  I'd like to see something like 4-8-16-32 every 2 years and then tacking on Pieter's 17% annual increase after that.

I think we're both wrong, it is the way it is because Satoshi assumed every node to be a miner when he made it that way.


I'm not exactly sure why it is that way, but running p2pool off of my node I have noticed it.  I assume there is logic in how getblocktemplate decides which transactions to include in the template.  A larger mempool means more transactions to sort through to decide which ones to include.  Try it yourself, do a getblocktemplate call with a 100,000 transaction mempool and one with a 2000 transaction mempool and there's a big difference, several seconds compared to nearly instant.

The parent comment was about bandwidth limiting.  If we had good control of our bandwidth on nodes, such as bittorrent clients provide, then we could have as many connections as we wanted and be able to define how much upload and download we want.
Setting maxconnections to a low number is not a good solution, but it is a solution we have now, ideally we could get some bandwidth control.
I don't know what crafty suppositions I made (I gave small blockers the benefit of the doubt by assuming every single block for the entire month is the maximum size), it's just basic arithmetic.  6MB blocks are doable without harming the network on just over 100GB of bandwidth per month.
@_date: 2015-10-21 17:09:12
I agree.  I assume this was merged in order to combat the tx spam attacks that have been occurring, which is fine.  However, once we have enough real demand for blockchain space, real users wanting to send transactions without enough space to fit into 1MB blocks, this merge turns into a fee market enforced not by miners but by the transaction relay rules of nodes.  Instead of low fee transactions getting mined eventually as the priority becomes higher, the network drops them altogether.  What's a user to do when their wallet thinks they've made a transaction yet the network has dropped it?  Double spend it with a higher fee?
@_date: 2015-10-21 22:59:55

Here's what i think has happened. Several weeks back a spammer hit the network hard with a couple hundred thousand ~15.5kB transactions that paid ~1000 satoshi fee each. 1000 satoshi is the default minrelaytxfee and 15kB is the default size of the "priority" transaction space set aside in a block. Priority transactions are very old transactions which miners will mine no matter the fee, so that they go out of the mempool eventually and this doesn't happen. However these transactions were over 15kB, so they don't fit in the default size priority space that miners give. So they never went away. In response, most miners have simply adjusted their minrelaytxfee so that their mempool doesn't fill up with these transactions and they never get mined. A large mempool has a very bad effect on the getblocktemplate latency for miners, so any miner who didn't reduce their mempool in this way would have a rather large (a couple percent extra?) orphan rate compared to those who did. Meanwhile, the transactions continue sitting idly in nodes' mempools getting rebroadcast occasionally by those of us who keep large mempool and default minrelaytxfee. But miners aren't mining them. With the possible exception of 21 Inc, I've noticed every block they mine is a full 1MB.

That's good evidence of votes coming from another source other than users then, if it's been crossposted to then it's a reasonable assumption that it's us.  Likewise with Out of curiosity, how many upvotes do those kinds of things usually get?

Well, the claim is that a fee market will allow miners to make more revenue compared to increasing the block size right?  Is there any work that shows or predicts that?


Surely there is some point where you realize that miners start shutting off in dangerous numbers if it is no longer profitable to mine.  I agree it's not 2016.  In 2030 only 1% of bitcoins will be left to mine.  Do you think we'll still have a secure coin then if price doesn't increase?  Miners will shut down after halvings if their revenue does not increase.  This will leave exahashes worth of useless equipment lying around waiting to be sold to the highest bidder.

the market availability isn't halved when the mining rewards halve though.  This is a common misconception, mining rewards make up only a small percentage of the daily exchange volume.  Halving is unlikely to have any effect on price outside of speculation that it will have an effect on price.  We saw bitcoin's first halving have barely any effect on price, then we saw dogecoin go through 6 halvings with no effect, then we saw litecoin's first halving with no effect on price.  With every one of them people thought price would go to the moon, and it happened with none of them.
@_date: 2015-10-12 20:29:45


I think you're misunderstanding the tx drops.  It's acceptable because the transaction doesn't drop from the entire network, only from your own node.  It can still be mined, even if a mining node drops a legit transaction other mining nodes will still have it.  And the transaction will be resent by nodes that still have it to nodes that don't periodically until it is mined.  So it doesn't really affect anything unless in the extremely unlikely scenario that it gets dropped by all 6000 nodes *simultaneously*.
Edit:  On the other hand, increasing the minrelaytxfee by default in all nodes makes bitcoin more expensive to use and sets a precedent for just simply increasing fees once we start to see real volume (non-spam volume) that small blocks can't keep up with.  This leads directly to a fee market, something I think we can agree the vast majority of bitcoin users do not want.

Great write up, but this assumption is false:


matter how small the fee (2), which would set the per-tx fee to ~1
satoshi (3). Rational miners will thus limit the number of txs they
accept (1) to ensure fees don't go to zero.
Blocks have basically been unlimited in practice for most of bitcoin's existence until recently and transaction fees weren't zero.  Including a transaction in a block carries with it an increased risk of orphan rate.  The minimum transaction fee a miner should be willing to include in a block is one that covers the expected loss due to increased orphan risk.  Transaction fees will never go to zero.

This policy excludes legit users who pay a small fee from even getting their transaction to a miner if the network happens to be have a high volume.  It's not left up to the miners to decide anymore whether they should include the transaction and reap their fees, it sets the default behavior of nodes to not even relay it to them to decide.  It deletes the transaction from the network depriving miners of their chance to earn fees, even if valid and not spam, and offers no solution to the user to fix it.  Before this PR, at least the transaction would persist and eventually get mined.  The only way now is for the user to double spend it.
Of course, luckily we do have enough XT nodes and older nodes that will keep the transaction in the mempool and re-transmit it occasionally so it will get mined eventually without the user needing to double spend.  
In my opinion this node behavior (were it universal) lets an attacker do much more damage since they can now forcibly omit all transactions not paying whatever transaction fee they decide.  The most fair way to omit spam is what XT does, which is drop transactions randomly from the mempool.  This way an attacker can't decide which transactions are relayed and which aren't.
Regardless, if blocks were larger it wouldn't be a problem anyway because spamming blocks full would be cost-prohibitive.  It's easy to disrupt now because there is only about 300-400 kB of transactions needed to create a queue.  With 8MB blocks the btc fee required to pull that off would increase ~25 fold and would disrupt business for a far shorter time.
A fee market allows an attacker to determine exactly how much it would cost to kick all transactions off the network.  Far from being the best and most fair way of dealing with the problem, it exacerbates the problem.  Again, luckily we have XT and older core nodes to make this attack vector infeasible.

By block 420k (projected July 28th, 2016 assuming 10min block average) there will be 15.75 million bitcoins in existence.  12.5 btc mined every 10 min works out to 657,000btc every year, which in the first year after reaching block 420k is 657,000/15,750,000 =  4.1% annual inflation in the first year after block 420k
Block 630k (projected at July 25th, 2020 assuming 10min block average) will put it at 1.9% annual inflation in the first year after.
But outside of any psychological effect investors invent to pump the price around a halving, it shouldn't affect price very much, especially if trade volume continues to increase.  Today for example, $61 million in btc was traded on exchanges, while only a little over $1 million worth of btc was mined in the same 24h.  So even if all miners dumped 100% for fiat, it wouldn't affect price more than 2% or so.
We saw all the halving dynamics play out in dogecoin already, just look at the price history there to see how little effect halvings had on price.  The first and second ones had an effect, but that was confounded by the initial hype, and the Josh Wise sponsorship, respectively.  None of the others had any effect whatsoever, because trade volume dwarfed the amount generated every day by mining.

And no, it doesn't justify downvoting everyone with a differing opinion.  But, this is reddit.  Try to express an opinion anywhere on reddit that the majority of redditors disagree with and you will get downvoted everytime.  Fact of life on reddit, and is no different.

Sidechain is a trick of words.  It has a separate blockchain, separate miners (unless namecoin or unobtanium also counts as bitcoin), a separate network and separate consensus rules.  It just has its value pegged to bitcoin's.  Litecoin also has its value pegged to bitcoin's, more or less.  Point is it's not bitcoin.

Sorry for wasting your morning.  The reason people recommend not carrying all your bitcoin around on your phone is because most people don't know how to do so securely, and it is bad advice for newbies.  Experienced bitcoiners are perfectly capable of doing so, however.  There's ~~3~~ 4 things you need to be able to do.  
.1. Backup your wallet to multiple, secure locations such as flash drives and know how to restore it on a new device.  2. Encrypt your wallet (before backing up) with a highly secure passphrase.  3. Don't get infected with a keylogger, or any other compromising virus.  4. Know the limitations of a lite wallet, and change the wallet file frequently enough that it isn't bogged down by huge numbers of transactions.
There are some new things like seed word phrases that make it a bit easier as well.

I'm not sure I understand.  Almost all bitcoin users use SPV clients, are you saying they should all run full nodes instead?


Mining is centralized in China who has very low labor, electricity and silicon production costs.  They also have very high internet costs.  Making decent bandwidth a requirement for miners in the short term will lead to decentralization since where it is centralized in now has very high bandwidth costs.


Growing block rewards would create room for competitors to be profitable.  Decreasing block rewards squeezes out competition.  Like any other industry.  When an industry is booming there are lots of start ups, when it is stagnant there is no chance for competition.


You don't have to pay a fee to send an email.  Weird comparison.


Obviously users wouldn't approve of miners being able to give themselves infinite rewards.  Even other miners wouldn't approve of that.  BIP 101 is something miners and users should both approve of and I've tried to outline why.

The whitepaper never mentioned a fee market, here's what it said:


less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
I wrote a bit about the mining incentive here:    tl;dr 32MB blocks by 2024 allow miners to make up for their lost revenue following halving number 4 with current standard transaction fees.
Do you have an estimate on how much more in fees we would have to pay if, say, there were 2MB worth of transactions vying for space in a 1MB block?

I did include transaction traffic if you read it again, not just block traffic.  I did not include SPV wallets (but I'd imagine that's pretty negligible - block headers are only 80 bytes), and yes I don't know about protocol traffic.  Bootstrapping traffic would be about (blockchain size / 8) which is somewhere around 7GB for you to sync up a node, since they get it from multiple peers.

If the cryptography was cracked we still wouldn't be able to reach consensus on what to switch to.  There would be people saying well, the paper was just published, it's all theoretical, no one has actually been able to crack it so we still have plenty of time.  Then there would be a dozen different proposals for other algorithms to switch to.  Then one of them would get implemented into a different client and it would be called contentious and an attack on bitcoin because there isn't consensus yet, maybe even labeled an altcoin.

6 years of data show that there is an ever increasing number of transactions.  It probably won't go on forever, but it is exponential right now.  Services like Coinbase and changetip absolutely do increase the number of on chain transactions.  Everything that uses bitcoin and makes it more useful does.
Forcing high fees per transaction is just a terrible idea and I don't even know why we are talking about it.  Who is going to use bitcoin if it has PayPal or higher level fees?  I certainly wouldn't.  Especially not when there are a multitude of altcoins that do the same thing as bitcoin for cheaper.  Having high fees will kill bitcoin for mass adoption, no one is going to pay $1 to send 250 bytes of data.

I'm sorry that response came across as hostile, I really didn't mean it to be.
If anyone is asking for votes either on their thread or another thread, yes that is against site-wide rules and we will remove it.  Simply cross posting though without saying "upvote for visibility!" or whatever isn't against the rules.
Yes there are site wide rules against vote brigades:  "Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user's posts, posts from a domain, etc."  Given subreddits like and and many more continue to exist, I'm not really sure what admins are looking for with this rule.  They've been asked for clarification on that many times and haven't given any.
Reddit admins have said they don't officially support the use of np. links to combat that specific problem, it's more of a reddit-wide mod agreement that it should be used and respected if requested.  The purpose of it is a CSS hack that when visitin an np. link the mods of that sub edit the np. subdomain's CSS to remove vote arrows and the comment reply button.
We'd be happy to enforce x-posts use the np. subdomain, it's an unwritten agreement among reddit mods that if asked for it's done.  Do you need help editing the CSS for np. links?  I've done it before, happy to help.
But yes, if there is any asking for votes anywhere, that will always be removed when we see it or if it gets reported.

Got upvotes everytime over there.  I don't think it's a lost cause.  But right now we have two working options.  We have XT/BIP 101 which it seems won't be the solution (although I'd like to wait until closer to Jan 11 to see what happens then).  And we have Core, which is 1MB blocks and clearly isn't a solution.  
I'm looking forward to seeing more options implemented into actual working clients.  However, too many and it will just split everyone even worse than it is now.  The developers really need to show some leadership here, figure it out, come to consensus and just implement it and tell us what to do.  Literally anything is better than staying at 1MB at this point, and I'm seriously getting worried that that is what will happen.

We have found that technology, SSDs.  HDD capacity seems to have hit a physical wall for 3.5 inch drives, and research and development money has gone into SSDs instead as they are the future.  We had SSDs in 2015 that can hold 16TB in a standard 3.5 inch bay (although they are like $10,000).  But the technology is still young, and costs are coming down dramatically and capacities are increasing.
Moore's Law is over for HDD, but it's just starting for SSDs.  It's also almost over for silicon chips like CPUs and GPUs, but people are already researching how to make chips on stuff other than silicon to keep it going.
But overall I think you are right, we shouldn't have to depend on future hardware improvements.  OP's 50 million transactions per day target puts us at ~173MB max block size in 5 years.  I do think that's a little ambitious, but I also think it will be possible if not in 5 years then probably in 10 or 15.  For today, we could go with something an order of magnitude smaller and still be fine with today's technology.
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:29:55


I dispute this.  If there are more transactions than can be confirmed, then nodes have to start dropping transactions to save RAM.  And the transactions that were dropped have to be resent at some point with a higher fee (assuming they aren't spam) either by the original sender or by a node that didn't drop it.  So you introduce redundant bandwidth usage.  Compact blocks and thin blocks gets rid of most of the block relay bandwidth, so transaction relay is all that's left.  When you have to send transactions twice with small blocks, you use more bandwidth than if you only had to send transactions once, with big enough blocks.  Not even getting into the obvious usability problem this introduces, it's simply untrue that larger max block sizes use more bandwidth for the same amount of transactions.
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:54:33
Yeah distributing the blockchain is an interesting idea.  I'm not quite sure how this would work though.  With today's method of pruning, I know you have to first get the whole chain before you can start to prune it.  So you would at least need the HDD capacity temporarily.  Is there a way of pruning so that you never have to grab the whole chain?
With random dropping, you have some non-zero risk that all nodes in the network drop the same block.  So of course you always have to have nodes with the whole blockchain on them.  How many we have to have is another one of those things people will debate about endlessly because there is no way to quantify the pros and cons of having a certain number.

I'm not understanding something then, because afaik you can't mine transactions with unconfirmed inputs (unless you are putting both transactions in the same block).
So let me restate my understanding.  You and I open a payment channel, we have a 2of2 multisig address, 3mno.
I send 1 BTC to 3mno.  The transaction is confirmed, and the channel is now open.  We generate a transaction together sending 1 BTC to my 1abc address and 0 BTC to your 1xyz address using my 1 BTC input from 3mno.  This transaction is time locked, so it won't be confirmed for 7 days (1008 blocks) after it was generated.
Now I send 0.2 BTC to you through the channel.  We both generate and sign a new transaction, spending 0.8 BTC to my 1abc address and 0.2 BTC to your 1xyz address from my 1 BTC input from 3mno.  This transaction reflects our current balance with each other.
Here's where I'm confused.  What does the anti-cheat transaction look like?  It can't be the 1 BTC original input being sent to your 1xyz address, why would I ever sign off my half of the 2 of 2 with that?  So it must be a transaction spending the 0.8 BTC input from my 1abc and the 0.2 BTC from your 1xyz with an output of 1 BTC to your 1xyz address, correct?
If so, now, I decide to cheat.  I am a miner (scratch my edit in the original comment, I do have to be a miner - because presumably the 0.8/0.2 BTC input transaction has a shorter lock time than the original 1 BTC transaction to me).  I do not broadcast the original transaction so you do not know I am trying to cheat.  However I add it to my block templates secretly nonetheless.  I mine it after the 7 day lock time is over.  Now your anti-cheat transaction is invalid, because its parent transaction (the one spending 0.8 BTC to me and 0.2 BTC to you) is invalid, because the input (my 1 BTC initial deposit to 3mno) no longer exists, it's been spent to myself.
What am I missing?

Hey, great explanation, thanks for the write up.  Maybe I'm not understanding something, but it seems like there is a glaring flaw in the anti-cheat mechanism if I am a miner.
If I am a miner, no matter my hash power, I can secretly mine the old "invalid" balance sheet transaction without broadcasting it to the network.  And in the same block, simultaneously I mine a transaction that spends the "anti-cheat" output to myself, making the anti-cheat transaction invalid on the network.  Can miners steal money from LN payment channels they are in?
~~Edit:  Come to think of it, I don't even need to be a miner, I just have to spend the output to myself with a higher fee than the anti-cheat transaction, right?~~

One question though, "the settlement transaction that a unilateral close commits to the blockchain has the funds either going to the initiating party (after the timeout) or the other party (if they have the revocationkey)".  I wasn't aware bitcoin scripting language had `if then` capability to send to one address if one requirement is filled, and another if not.  Do you mean that the output of the unilateral closing transaction can be spent by by the stealing party once timeout is done, and immediately by the victim?  In that case is it actually two blockchain transactions to close a channel unilaterally?

That might work if everyone on the network used the same mempool management configuration.  But as you know it's user configurable.  So while you can make your node relay less, that just puts the burden on the rest of the network instead.
And a while loop would work if you constantly increased fees (as the fee market is designed to do).  It's true that that system works fairly well for anti-spam measures, but we are talking about real users who want their transactions confirmed.

You're referring to patent-pending ASIC-boost technology, which has been licensed by Bitmain, the leading ASIC manufacturer.  Other hardware manufacturers can license ASIC-boost too, you know.  Bitmain does't have a particular inherent advantage, it's just that other ASIC manufacturers haven't licensed it (that we know of, at least haven't done so publicly).

If I sent you 1 BTC time locked to block  how much would you give me for it?

If bitcoin can't be used for payments then it has no value.  All of the other things that make it valuable are useless without the making payments part, the ability to send and receive.


Not everything scales linearly, but bitcoin does.  There have been tests on the testnet and in altcoins with larger block sizes that show this.


The UTXO set is one thing that will probably not grow linearly.  If it's 40million today with 1MB blocks, it's going to be less than 400 million with 10MB blocks.  Evidence for this is in altcoins, which have far fewer transactions than bitcoin (by a couple orders of magnitude) and yet the utxo sets, while smaller than bitcoin's are not orders of magnitude smaller like you would expect if utxo growth was linear with more transactions.
Edit: Segwit in a way incentivizes transactions with many inputs, because the signatures of all those inputs no longer need to be stored in the blockchain.  Today a transaction with 100 inputs and 1 output is far larger than a transaction with 1 input 100 outputs.  With segwit they should be about the same size I believe.


What happened during that fork was different that what Zander is proposing.  That fork happened because a miner (F2Pool) was mining using the block template from another pool.  They were not validating that template or its headers at all.  The miner was mining an old invalid version, one of the 5% that were still mining the old version after a soft-fork had activated.  Zander is proposing that miners DO validate the headers first, before they start mining on them.  If they were doing this that fork wouldn't have happened.


Yes, unlike the rest of the requirements for running a node (CPU,  RAM and bandwidth), we do need to depend on Moore's to increase hard drive capacity.  the historical trend has been that capacity increases [about an order of magnitude every 5 years]( and the trend shows no signs of slowing, yet.  So we can expect 20-40TB hard drives for around $100 in 5 years from now, and 200-400TB hard drives in a decade.

I assume you're talking about lightning network.  It requires the block chain.


Yes, but the fix for that is simple.  Don't allow transactions larger than 100kB.  Validating 10 100kB transactions is far faster than validating 1 1MB transaction.  Validation in this manner is highly parallelizable and does scale linearly.  Validating 1000 100kB transactions takes 10 times longer than validating 100 100kB transactions.


It is growing exponentially, but not in accordance with the number of transactions.  Plot the total number of transactions and since October 2011 we've had an 88 fold increase in transactions.  But in the same time period, utxo set has only grown 44 fold.  UTXO set growth rate is half that as number of transactions.  But anyway, right now people are disincentivized to decrease the utxo set.  It is much cheaper in terms of fees and tx size to break 1 input into 100 outputs than it is to consolidate 100 inputs into 1 output.  Segwit will fix this, and I'd expect utxo growth to slow or maybe even reverse because of it.


I don't think you understand.  That blockchain fork happened because miners weren't validating headers.  Zander is saying miners should validate headers.  But you still call it validation-less mining for some reason.  It's not.  If miners were validating the headers after that soft-fork as Zander suggest, the 6 block deep blockchain fork would not have happened.


Do you mean 13TB per year?  My modest home internet connection of 5Mbps can upload 20TB per year.  How fast is your upload?

So they wait until the time has passed to mine it.  I'm not saying they can bypass the time-lock, I'm saying they can wait until it is valid and then mine it without it ever having been broadcasted to the network so no chance was given to the user to broadcast the penalizing transaction.

LN would require each party to hold a minimum of 2 million transactions until the time of settlement in order to have a million payments between them.  They would also have to monitor the blockchain (or someone would) watching for each of those possible million transactions so that they can broadcast their anti-cheat transaction in the event that one party tries to settle an older transaction.


How is that butchering?  Oh no, you have to send 10 100kB transactions instead of 1 1MB one.  What's the big deal?  It makes no difference, either in terms of fees or blockspace, and 100kB can hold about 500 inputs.  Let me know the other examples of the system scalability that has an exponential characteristic.


As I explained, the utxo set doesn't grow as fast as the number of transactions grows.  Half a TB of utxos implies ~1 billion transactions with unspent outputs.  With 21 million bitcoins total, the average utxo value would have to be 0.021 BTC with that sized set.  Seems too small


Whatever, there's no validation, there's partial validation, and there's full validation.  What F2Pool did to cause the fork you used as an example was no validation.  Partial validation would not have caused that problem.


What are you talking about?  Yes, we do signal soft forks in the version field of the header, even after BIP9


Yes, a full node is already too difficult for any one except hardcore enthusiasts or businesses to run.  It can't be run on a cheap VPS anymore, because as you say 80GB is too much.  I agree that a 32TB blockchain is too much today, and will be too much in 5 years.  But I don't think it will too much in 10 years.  And I think it will be easy in 15-20 years.  As I discussed in another comment, storage increases by an order of magnitude every ~5 years.  A 100Mbps download connection can download 32TB in less than a month.


Not for SPV clients, only electrum/mycelium like clients that depend on centralized servers.

A stealing money transaction (broadcasting an earlier channel state) is a n-time-locked transaction, where n can be any amount of days.  When a user or monitoring service sees this stealing transaction broadcasted to the network, they have n-time to broadcast their penalizing transaction that will give them the full channel amount and nullify the stealing transaction.
This is first off assuming that the stealing transaction is broadcasted to the network in the first place, LN hubs or users could be miners themselves and silently mine it privately without ever broadcasting, or make a back-room deal with a miner to pass the transaction to them to silently mine it.
They could also DDOS you or your monitoring service so that you are unaware the stealing transaction was broadcasted.
Additionally, under current network conditions, fee requirements are constantly changing and trending upwards.  There could be such a case where a stealing transaction pays a higher fee than the penalizing transaction (due to varying network conditions at the time they are created) and it is in miners' best interest to confirm the stealing transaction instead of the penalizing one.  RBF will not help with this, because that would require a signature from the person you are stealing from.  CPFP could help with this, but it could help both sides equally until an fee war happens between the thief and victim and the miner ends up getting the majority of the money in the channel.
One more thing, the stealing party knows the fee paid by the penalizing transaction.  They could spam the network with transactions that pay a higher fee than it for the duration of the n-lock time to ensure the penalizing transaction doesn't confirm in time.  This will be cheaper to do during times where the network is already highly backlogged, so whether or not it makes economic sense to do this depends on the duration of the lock time, how high network fees are, and how many transactions will need to be spammed in order to prevent the penalizing transaction from confirming.
So there are in fact several ways a hub *could* steal money.  How likely they are is up to you to decide.
