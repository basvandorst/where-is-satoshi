So you're completely ignoring the fact that these tax cuts are not paid for in a reduction in government spending? The fact that these "cuts" will blow a gigantic hole in the budget remains. There is also very little evidence that supports the idea behind tax cuts paying for themselves with the creation of new wealth. What is pure fantasy is imagining that this will all "trickle down" somehow.
And yes, the rich are going to be paying less while the middle class takes it in the chops with a complete elimination of the SALT and child tax reductions. That is a taxation system that is more regressive than any in the last 100 years and borders on wealth redistribution.

Evidence of what? Trump's entire laughable misadventure is posted publicly on Twitter, including a direct line of contact from Russia and Wikileaks to the Trump campaign posted by his idiot son Don Jr. Just yesterday he was tweeting more attacks on the FBI and going after the deputy director McCabe...personally by name. Incredible. Why would an innocent man have anything to fear from this investigation? Why would an innocent man attempt to discredit the agency responsible for completely resolving him of any crime? Imagine if Obama had pulled one tenth of this crazy bullshit - he would have been hanging from a tree inside a week. 
You can't make this shit up. Truth really is stranger than fiction.

I agree with you on the take home part - I stand to see a substantial increase in my income as a result of the tax bill. The issue is the cost at which this increase comes.
Of course the budget and tax code are separate - the reason I bring up the hole in the budget now is that the same actors who claimed the Obama administration is passing on the costs of government debt to our grandchildren (and rightfully so) are the ones who are increasing the deficit by a trillion dollars and crossing their fingers that growth will increase because of this. Seems disingenuous at worst, absolutely dangerous and misguided at best.
SALT deductions exist because blue states subsidize red states. The majority of Federal income comes from the states that have state income tax. Now that this deduction is eliminated (which will NOT be offset by the doubling of the standard deduction - these filers itemize every year), those high earners in blue states are now subsidizing the lifestyles of others living in states that do not tax income at the state level. Wealth redistribution absolutely can happen by cutting taxes and it's happening in 2018.

LMAO, 2 Trump advisors are already behind bars for their party in the "collusion story" with more to follow. Are you not following the story? Trump is now actively attempting to silence witnesses (McCabe) into silence and is the first president ever to discredit his own fucking FBI and CIA. One more massive "first ever" for the worst president ever to set foot in the White House. You can attempt to paint a pretty picture of this presidency but the shit stink is everywhere.

Given how careful he's been (up until now) about his identity I agree, but I think his ego has taken over to some extent. I mean...going through the trouble of crafting emails with the subject line "please leak" to an in-the-know confidant about how he's "not bloody American" and how he is frustrated that the white paper isn't being attributed to him?
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:39:56
True. Also the fact that a lot of these supposed "smoking gun blog posts" were edited to show identifying information sometime around 2013 gives me the greatest pause. This means (supposedly) that he intentionally outed himself by way of unencrypted emails to-from a confidential source that he trusted  AND he decided to make his blog show information tying his identity to Nakamoto. Why would he throw away his anonymity in such a weird and sloppy way? I agree that it doesn't seem right. The only thing I can think of is perhaps Satoshi losing his mind and touch with reality?

Presidents do not control the stock market. Tax cuts will result in the largest redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the top 1% we've ever seen not to mention is guaranteed to blow a 1 Trillion hole in the budget. Worst approval rating of all time, constantly gets into petty Twitter spats like a child and denigrates the office of the Presidency to levels never seen before, constantly destroys the trust of the rest of the world had placed in the US, continually expresses his support for autocrats like Putin.

I think this is the key to "productive Satoshi unmasking and taking back his project" events. If the Bitcoin community just lets him do what he wants with impunity then there's a real danger of the entire idea of Bitcoin run via distributed consensus being trashed in favor of a "benevolent dictator" type scenario. 
With that said I do think you make good points in regards to how Bitcoin Core development could be improved with the creator onboard and a part of the decision making.
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:25:37
True, but most of those projects (perhaps BT aside) don't bill themselves as decentralized trustless ledger systems. How the core development of Bitcoin is performed is a lynchpin of the legitimacy of the currency. For the record I don't think Satoshi coming out of the shadows to lead the dev team would be a bad thing as long as he wasn't a dick about it and didn't try to exploit his gravitas for personal gain.
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:10:16

I disagree. 
As a Bitcoin holder and enthusiast, nothing terrifies me more than Satoshi being outed. If he's anonymous, he cannot be reached for comment and thus his opinion means nothing. We continue on our decentralized way and try to reach consensus the best way possible. 
However, if he is outed he has a tremendous amount of sway. Imagine he either takes a stance on Bitcoin that runs counter to the majority or is simply to enrich himself - he could single-handedly destroy the reputation (and thus overall success) of Bitcoin by uttering a few wrong words.

Yes, THIS time is different from all the other times a major exchange went down (Mt. Gox 2011, Mt. Gox 2012, Bitcoinica, BitFloor) and the end was neigh.  Clearly Bitcoin is dead THIS time.  


The safeguards Coinbase, Bitstamp and others have enacted are already miles ahead of Mt. Gox (required double-auth, most funds in cold storage, manual audits of funds, fast and efficient customer support).  In short, you'd be able to tell if an exchange was as bad or worse than Gox because their coins would already be gone.


That's why there's 2 Bitcoin ETFs and tremendous interest in BTC from Wall Street even after 4 years of volatility, right?  Bitcoin is high risk, high reward.  If you think the exchange with the worst reputation going under is going to sink Bitcoin, you weren't around when it was the only exchange and the price went sub $10.

How exactly is untraceable paper money viable if cash registers, wallets and large cash deposits keep getting stolen left and right?  
Same concept as above.  
When secured the right way (cold storage or brain wallet), Bitcoin is more secure than any governmentally-backed bank could ever hope to achieve. When trusted to a third-party like an exchange, Bitcoin is vulnerable to theft just like cash.  
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:11:30
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:43:05


Good point - most people deposit their money into a bank that accepts cash and converts it to numbers in a ledger database.  The bank then claims to be able to give you an equal amount of cash for your deposits, but have nowhere near equal amounts of total cash to total customer deposits. I'd trust money in a Bitcoin wallet over a fractional reserve bank any day of the week.


Not quite.  Bitcoins in cold storage are infinitely more secure and divisible than cash under a mattress, and are more easily recalled. I wouldn't look at cold storage as an archaic form of storage, it's the safest way to store a digital currency. 
Sure, you can have a hot wallet on a web site somewhere, but it should be treated like cash in your wallet - vulnerable and accessible to thieves. When you want to secure a large amount of cash, you deposit it in a bank.  When you want to secure a large amount of Bitcoin you send it to cold storage.  Bitcoin allows every person in the world to effectively be their own bank without the need for a third-party, which I think is one of its greatest selling points.

Strongly disagree.  If there were a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol, it would have died in 2009.


There's a greater chance somebody randomly digs up your "secure" jar of money than your Bitcoin wallet being compromised if you take the proper steps.


There are a lot of Bitcoin proponents who are stubbornly libertarian/anarcho-capitalists, but I am not one of them.  I think there's room for sensible Bitcoin government regulation that allows the crypto ecosystem to thrive.  I believe there's room for crypto to coexist along side fiat.  Governmental bodies are always behind the times though, so it may take some time for these frameworks you speak of to be implemented.  


You're right - Satoshi didn't release bitcoind 1.0 with all of these features.  However, I wouldn't say that's a bad thing.  The absence of these tools creates a space for entrepreneurs and developers to fill.


I want the same thing. I agree that we're very early on in the age of digital currency and another coin may come along and replace Bitcoin, but I think Bitcoin will last longer than you think and have a far bigger impact than you could have imagined on the world.  
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:25:47
I started by looking at the API page of Bitstamp and Gox (before the implosion) and taking a look at the resources they offered.  Most exchanges with an API give you the stub code in Java or Python to connect to their secure API layer using nonces and HMAC-encoded secret API keys.  
From there, the rest is up to you - but take a look on GitHub, a lot of programmers have open-sourced their trading bots. I think there are links to trading bots from the Bitstamp API page, but I can't recall.
Good luck!
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:48:18


No.  Just...no.  You're conflating the risk of dealing person-to-person with a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol?  So...you haven't heard of Bitcoin ATMs I take it?  I can walk up to a Bitcoin ATM and turn cash into Bitcoin.  Convenient, non-expensive, non-time-consuming, non-shady, high-tech and NOT weird, I might add. If you want to deal with a person to person transaction you can - and those risks are the same as buying or selling an item on Craigslist in person for cash.  Bitcoin has nothing to due with the "shady, weird" elements of personal dealings - those have been there since the beginning of time.


Considering 70% of people surveyed haven't heard of Bitcoin yet, I'm not too worried about consumer adoption being driven by merchant adoption.  Bitcoin is in its early stages.  The fact that so many merchants have come on board at this early time is actually a point counter to the one you're trying to make.  If merchants were concerned about low consumer adoption they wouldn't be accepting BTC in the first place.  You sound like Krugman talking about the internet being DOA, by the way.

It's not about making money as far as I'm concerned - its about the prestige of the entire human race.  But if you wanted to break it down into cost/profit margin, you can.  There's large deposits of gold, platinum and other precious metals in asteroids, comets and the crust of other planets - harvesting those resources and bringing them back to earth would put you in Rockefeller or Rothschild territory.

Fresh fellow CS graduate here. Just out of curiosity, where are you starting in the Bitcoin ecosystem?  I already have offers from companies to make decent money as a developer, but I also want to make the jump directly to Bitcoin if possible.
@_date: 2014-07-18 18:27:33
They are, not you.  Sorry, should have made that more clear.
It's weird, some people are so anti-bitcoin that they dismiss it out of hand without even taking a second to consider how useful it can be to society.

I know you're being facetious, but what is the alternative right now? An ACH transfer that will cost upwards of $40 and a wait time of a week or more? There's problems with BTC scaling (which should be fixed with the net few BIPs including seg wit), but I don't see any other viable alternative that makes me want to jump ship.

He has good otc ratings and a lot of posts on a Bitcoin forum, therefore he must be legit! I'll give him 10,000 BTC and make 3300% interest this year!  Cool!

People are panic selling because of BTCST going under. See you all at $8
@_date: 2012-08-03 19:29:40
I know, I just wanted to keep the toilet paper joke going a little longer.  Sorry. Carry on.
@_date: 2012-08-17 21:54:13
I know, seriously.  I'm sure a few people with 2000+ BTC to throw into a PPT will get out with their money and interest, but it depends on the bond holder.  Some (like Goat) are still waiting for pirate to release their funds on Monday, while others on bitcointalk claim they've already completely re-imbursed the shareholders and got out with profit themselves. I'm not holding my breath that pirate comes back on Monday and can miraculously pay all the principal back...*with interest up to the hour*, so he claims.
@_date: 2012-08-29 02:11:33
An anonymous person claimed he could generate 3300% annual interest on large BTC investments, pass-through bonds were set up with his account holders to accommodate small BTC investments, most intelligent people shouted "THIS IS A PONZI" to which the investors shouted "NO ITS NOT", anonymous pirate man declares his operation is ending, claims he can re-imburse everyone, ends up defaulting.  
@_date: 2012-08-17 18:47:50
I'm interested in this too.  Well a default usually means investors receive less money than they put in. Since he's giving all the money back with earned interest, they might say it "doesn't qualify" as a default.
@_date: 2012-08-17 17:43:43
More than r/atheism? Maybe. Just maybe.
@_date: 2012-08-13 19:24:18
I disagree.  I believe Keynesian economics have some merit.  I think Fisher's debt-deflation spiral and several Minksy moments have occurred in the global market at large.  The US in particular is suffering from a severe lack of demand, wouldn't you agree?  That's a basic tenet of Keynesian economics.
@_date: 2012-08-17 21:25:43
I think the credit crunch, housing bubble collapse and following recession had a lot to do with the tech bubble tapering off in '08.  Both bitcoin bubbles were caused by pure speculation, although this most current bubble collapse didn't have as many panic sellers who threw all of their coins on the market as last time.
@_date: 2012-08-29 19:36:52
You really think this is the actual Pirate? C'mon.  You either haven't been on reddit for very long or you're 12 years old.

God, I hope we're not heading for another May 2011.  On the flip-side, a market correction may be just what Bitcoin needs, even though some analysts say that Bitcoin is still *under*-valued.

A guy who was running a 7% weekly interest bond called Bitcoin Savings and Trust just stopped the operation.  Check out bitcointalk.org and search "pirateat40" or "Bitcoin Savings and Trust" for more info.
@_date: 2012-08-21 18:10:49
When you get stupid people to believe that a pyramid scam = "High-yield, high-risk Investment Program" you'll be able to sell them anything.  There's already a guy on bitcointalk offering high-interest Pirate-like bonds with the tagline "Miss Pirate dividend payments?  Get in on a 6% weekly interest investment!"
@_date: 2012-08-19 20:26:33

@_date: 2012-08-13 23:04:38
Agreed. Thanks for the polite discourse too, you'd be surprised how many political discussions turn into ugly, knock-down drag-out straw-man anecdotal freakshows here on the reddits.  
@_date: 2012-08-18 15:45:51
That's a possibility, actually. Some people were speculating that pirate himself was buying up the bonds before he shut down to keep the prices high on the PPT funds, since that was a big source of capital for the operation.  As far as anyone knows, the PPTs were run by verified 3rd parties (like Goat and others) but there's no way to know for sure.
@_date: 2012-08-18 15:12:10
Not everyone would convert to fiat, just some. And just the thought of other people selling their bitcoins probably led to a lot of people entering yesterday's sell-off, thanks to the psychology of a bank run, the "I gotta take advantage of this bubble" mentality and panic selling.  
@_date: 2012-09-09 17:54:05
No picture of the product, very little specs.  Nothing to see here.

Interesting point about the ASICs and the difficulty increase.  I never thought of the time gap between hashing speed increasing due to ASICs joining the network and the difficulty raising.  Its going to be dependent on how many ASICs BFL ships at once, I guess. If they ship out a few hundred, it might not make a difference.  If they ship out thousands at a time, you may be right.  
As for waiting for making an investment, have you seen glbse.com?  You can invest money in a mining company, who will use your money to upgrade their equipment and increase their hashing power.  You're essentially buying yourself a fraction of their overall hashing power without actually having to buy any equipment, and most of the bonds return a weekly dividend at pretty good rates.  If you're uncomfortable with the company's direction, you can always sell the bond.  Interesting stuff, it may be the way future Bitcoin traders invest so as to not get their "hands dirty" with ASICs and mining but still raking in a nice profit.
@_date: 2012-08-17 21:37:34
Yeah, its their fault for thinking a HYIP paying out 3300% yearly ever stood a chance of working beyond a few months, I know.  I'm just making the assumption that a lot of the big time investors will want to take their profits and convert to fiat (assuming pirate comes through) knowing that there aren't any more 7% weekly interest bonds available. 
@_date: 2012-09-13 17:34:29
I believe they nominated themselves when no alarms went off in their heads at 3300% interest per year.

Some of them are STILL defending pirate on the boards saying shit like this: "this was his plan all along, everyone who yelled 'PONZI!' were wrong". Hahah, oh dear God.  Too Big To Fail - now Bitcoin verified.
Yep, I think we'll head in a downward spiral to about $8 or $9 after all of this fully plays out.  Assuming pirate actually comes through with the rest of the money, you'll see people wanting to cash out to fiat. 
@_date: 2012-08-03 17:29:52

Well, we know that he provided 7% weekly interest on tens of thousands of bitcoins invested in his possession, maybe more.  We also know that buying PPT bonds ("pirate pass through") on GLBSE were popular since getting an account with his official "Bitcoin Savings and Trust" was by invite only. All of these bitcoins could have been provided by a few early adopters, but logic and Occam's Razor would have me believe that hundreds, maybe thousands of people had direct accounts with him.

Ah, that makes more sense.  Something told me retargeting wasn't a set static amount of time. It'll be interesting to see how price is affected if/when BFL starts shipping Jalapenos. If it drops, I have money waiting to buy some coins at a better price.

Right? This happens with every shooting. What's more likely, a) that the entire government and parts of the private sector are colluding to produce a "false flag" to take away all guns or b) a deranged lunatic shot up a school? I like how conspiracy theorists seem to be immune to Occam's Razor.

Facebook doesn't claim its stock to be a fungible, transmittable digital currency - its stock is merely a financial asset. I'm not sure that comparison works. 
If Facebook had "Facecoin" and pre-distributed billions of coins to shareholders, the programmers, Facebook employees and other random people on forums that happened to be posting at the right time pre-launch...that's a better comparison.

As a person sympathetic to libertarian beliefs who has proudly supported Bitcoin since early 2011, thank you for this thread OP.  I agree wholeheartedly that we need to remove these political sidebars.  
The bottom line for me is this - everyone here who supports Bitcoin wants more people to begin using and adopting Bitcoin, yet the very people they want to attract are being pushed away by political rhetoric that some in the community insist must be kept close at hand because it had a hand in creating the Bitcoin movement.  
You don't need to be a Libertarian to use Bitcoin, so why have on the sidebar?  There's no prerequisite for using Bitcoin, so why pretend like there's some invisible unspoken "anti-statist" barrier that everyone has to pass through to use Bitcoin?  Who the fuck cares if "evil statists" are using Bitcoin, isn't that the entire point?  Isn't Bitcoin supposed to be "non-political"?  Aren't we trying to attract as many people as possible to Bitcoin regardless of our own personal political philosophies? If these previous statements are true, then having political sidebars in doesn't make any sense.  
@_date: 2013-03-13 20:06:01
Actually yeah, it kind of does say it all.
@_date: 2013-05-21 03:20:07
Thanks!  I appreciate the response.  I'll make sure not to trust the safety of a virtual machine.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:11:08


I respectfully disagree.  I know it flies in the face of the more die-hard Libertarian/Crypto-anarchists and their goals in regard to the outcome of Bitcoin, but I fully believe that Bitcoin can work along side the US dollar and not pose a threat to it.  I believe that Bitcoin can increase the GDP of the US, decrease the middlemen (PayPal, Dwolla, etc.) in financial transactions and revolutionize the payment industry.  
Will this cause banks to collapse?  Possibly, I doubt it though.  In the same way other world currencies fluctuate compared to each other, so will the rate of USD/BTC, BTC/EU, and vice versa.  It's understandable that we'll be treading new ground because inflationary central reserve currencies will be competing with deflationary decentralized Bitcoin, but I don't see some mass exodus for a new internet-based currency happening any time soon.

@_date: 2013-11-19 19:57:12
Exactly this.  I'm really sick of anarcho-capitalists who try to sell Bitcoin as a tool to "bring down the government". I'm sick of anarcho-capitalists that claim Bitcoin as "theirs" and claim any deviation from the their view as "divide and conquer tactics". I'm really sick of it, because these people are hurting Bitcoin, not helping.
If you tell your average American that they should get into a super-cool new internet currency that has no transaction fees, they'll be interested in how it can improve their lives.
If you tell your average American that they should invest in Bitcoin to "completely collapse the central reserve banking system", they'll immediately discount Bitcoin as ludicrous.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:46:25
I've been in since 2011.  Enthusiasm waxes and wanes, I think.  It seems like every bubble brings a huge swell of super-excited people who sort of understand the currency and attempt to use it as a 'get rich quick' scheme, while every crash leads to those very people abandoning Bitcoin and calling it a 'scam that lost all their money'.  
Meanwhile, the true believers of Bitcoin are holding and using Bitcoin for real applicable uses besides speculation, which is sort of the entire point of the currency.  I use it everyday to access seedboxes and occasionally buy products.  
I wouldn't worry too much. Considering how much this community has grown in the last few months, we're heading for a bright future regardless of the price BTC can fetch in USD.
