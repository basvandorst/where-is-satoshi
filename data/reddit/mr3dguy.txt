Even for only it's practical usage gold would be way more valuable than copper, even if scarcity was the same. Which it isn't, there is a ton more copper than gold.

The guide is never RISK more than 2% into a single entity. That means, if bitcoin is at $100 and my total portfolio is $1000 I can invest $100 if the total fall I will allow price to go before selling is $20. I can invest $200 if the biggest fall is $10, $400 if it had really low volatility and the maximum fall was $5. In each case I would lose $20, or 2% of my portfolio. 40% is the maximum in any one market, or even market sector, so that if there was an entire collapse in metal prices, property, oil, stocks, you would only be down 40% and not lying in the gutter.

Yea, the bet isn't really about how much they will be worth, it's whether or not they will reach mainstream usage.

It's not like gold at all. Gold has valuable properties and uses, and scarcity. Like all metals gold is a commodity. Bitcoins are not.

The stockmarket is, at it's basic level, the combined value of all public listed companies. Companies create wealth, and pay dividends. The more wealth they create, the more demand there is to earn part of the payoff. If companies don't create wealth, they fall, but as they do new ones arise in new industries. Sometimes a recession occurs (1999,2007) and the value of them falls, usually these don't last more than 2 years. Prices will eventually create new highs, on very rare occasions we have a depression (1930s). However long term, the combined value of these companies always goes up. You could say this reflects humanities progress in productivity.

Look at any speculation mining stock, they all have the same pattern. A cliff wall climb followed by a fall to about 1/3 the price, then a slow downtrend for eternity.

The scarcity of bitcoins matters not if nobody wants them. Gold has the advantage of always having someone it will be useful to.
