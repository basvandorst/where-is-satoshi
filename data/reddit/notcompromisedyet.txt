Bitcoin doesn't require more computing power nor to consume more. The total energy consumption is rising because many people are involved in mining and keep adding new machines to their rig.
Its in their financial interest but it will just increase complexity... And not do anything regarding the ability to process transactions. The network will still work with less miners and if one day its not financially interesting to mine anymore, we'll have less miners and use less energy.

The French for keychain is "porte clefs" (port-clay). Literally translates as key-carrier.
Maybe I'll start refer to my ledger as a porte clefs now and not just "le bitcoin thingy"

You can try using shrimpy or hodlbot for rebalancing accross a few cryptos. It can yield positive results... Or you can loose money, but overall risk should be less than trading like a degenerate.

Less bitcoins are created to compensate for all the bitcoins that get burnt everyday because people forget their password. On the same time, demand keeps the same.

If you find a seller for this price, yes.
I would sell you a bitcoin but it would cost 2M€. Would you take the offer? No because market price let you buy for cheaper.
Same, nobody will sell you a btc for 4000 if they can market sell at 6300 and find a buyer.

Shittiest use case, who still used paid for wifi in 2019? I've been working at sales for a company that deploys wifi and hotpots, for the past three years we had just one customer who wanted the paid access. Everybody else just laughs at the idea of asking people to pay for wifi.
You don't make this profitable in the real world where people have 4g. You don't open your guest wifi for the money, you open it for the data and the analytics.

Depends of the country... Breaking the key here would maybe not be prosecutable in itself, but move my bitcoin and I can sue you for unauthorised access to an information system. Like if you stole my login credential to my bank account and moved funds out of it.

Just like any other art from fucking talented artist, you sell in galeries or fairs because there's where the money is. You just gotta find a buyer who accepts to use btc, but good luck for that (it would probably be seen as shady to ask for btc)

5G is a last mile radio standard for the Internet, not a backbone transmission medium you absolute moron. If you understand that you understand where the bottleneck would be for a decentralised system thus why you initial question is irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-04-18 06:04:00
This guy is right, you are not competent.
You do not take into account how the Internet works and only focus on last mile 3gpp data link standard.
Read about backbones and what they imply, read about top tier carriers, read about peering and all that shit. Hopefully you will understand the reactions to your message.
And before you give me a 5 years old reply about mirrors, I have two master degrees in telco and 10 years experience in networking of all sorts. Get competent and it will all be clear for you. In the meantime give me some of that weed you've been smoking, looks crazy strong.

No it's real news. The national Bank announcement is because some radio here (Europe 1) said there was an agreement but there's not. Because they don't need one to sell btc. Banque de France went public because they don't want to be associated with risky investments. 
Anyway wait and see

Hardly so since you still have to enter your pin and manually confirm the transaction on the device.
The only attack would be to execute arbitrary code on the ledger application processor over Bluetooth... Thus only possible if the attacker is paired to the device and the device is turned on. That's not exactly something easy to do.
Credit card payment terminals have had bluetooth for a long time.

Coinbase to your private wallet then to your online shop.
Make sure your wallet rotates addresses and that your online shop also does.

It's made using state of the art secure parts designed and integrated by smart people who know what they are doing and how things work in regard to security in the real money industry, and it's backed by ANSSI. 
Bluetooth payment terminals don't get hacked, the secure element on your credit card doesn't get hacked. This new nano probably won't get hacked.

Just write down the seed and hide the paper some place people never look and never steal.
The chances you mess up or forget your algorithm in 5 years are higher than the chance of somebody finding the paper hidden in plain sight under a magnet on your fridge, of that somebody steals your fridge.
Edit: just in case I'm compromised : my own paper wallet isn't on my fridge. It's somewhere at my office, plz don't raid home ^^ ^^
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:44:52
Two ledgers (both with same seed) in case one fails and I lose the paper seed for some reason. Or one ledger one trezor. Monthly check that both wallets work and that paper seed still exists.
If you just store and forget for years, forget the wallets just keep the seed on paper or engraved in metal.

As for taxes, your friend won't have to deal with them if he doesn't cash out. The government doesn't tax hodlers, only sellers. 
Bitcoin gains are a "revenu" this fall in the impôt sur le revenu category. Taxes will have to be paid by whoever changes the coins for euros, which I suppose would be you. .

I think it's a bad idea but not too bad if you indeed tend do loose things and if you trust your decryption key mental algorithm. 
If you do it, stuff some additional files in your encrypted zip file to increase its size and use a low-profile file name.
Instead of a few kb file named "seed" , your attacker will see a few megabytes file named "awesome kerbal moon rocket" and its much less likely to be a target.
