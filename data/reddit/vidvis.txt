From what you posted? You posted what you thought. I read what you thought, and thought otherwise. Therefore, you do not think what I think. It's not that complicated.

Fair enough. Sorry about being snarky. You know how the internets are. Hope you day goes well.

Provide research for someone named bitcoinalways who created their account two months ago? lol, ok. Try this thought experiment: for anyone who became wealthy with bitcoin, where did that money come from?

That was always a lie.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:43:32


You're right, but not in the way you think.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:56:41
Yeah, me too. I just stick with reading what people post.

Do people really believe this? I mean, anybody?
