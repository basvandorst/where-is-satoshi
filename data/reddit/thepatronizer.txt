“You could be wrong, I could be wrong”
First of all, I didn’t make a prediction, so how can I be wrong? And second, why even comment about the future value when you admit having no clue what it will be, especially when you offered such a wide range of possibilities:
Here how about this? I think BTC will be valued at somewhere between $0 and $1 billion USD per coin. Means nothing.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:31:03
Right, but if you believe in BTC then you aren’t banking on it only being worth $20k long term. Just because you get the BTC today doesn’t mean you are assuming it’s eventual value won’t increase. I felt that was implied, otherwise he wouldn’t be asking the question.
Hell if that’s the case, let me phrase it this way... “would you accept $20k to cut two years off your life?” Most would probably say no. It’s the prospect of BTC speculative value that’s makes the question interesting.

I’m leaning toward the stegosaurus pattern. Few more up and downs before we create the neck.
@_date: 2019-07-29 04:13:52
So you’re guessing value in the range of $100 million to $6 billion? Got it. And you’re comment will only be correct in 3 years if the value is $100 million or less, since you literally stated that “[your] guess is under $100 million”

Depends if you ask a 21 y/o or a 90 y/o. Me personally in my late 30s I’d say sure. The later years are terrible anyway. Ask my grandparents.

So they only wanted the equivalent of $1 USD? That’s some cheap labor.
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:45:28
It’s win-win for him. If it hits $8k then he “wins” and if it never drops to $8k again he still “wins” because he can keep spewing the non-sense he is spewing now. I’m not saying it’s impossible to go down to $8k but I am saying he has no clue just like the rest of us.

“Descending trend since beginning of July”
That’s adorable. You’re basing this “bear” market on a less-than-one-month trend? I personally think it may go down to $8k but will consolidate for a month or two before going up significantly in Q4.
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:11:44
You have no idea what I think BTC will do. When did I say it would go up or down long term? You’re the one on here making predictions, and the reality is you have no idea just like everyone else. You’re value range is laughable and offers no significant insight. And one doesn’t have to use BTC for anything beyond speculative store of value for it to satisfy its need.

The premise itself is asinine because it would hardly ever present itself as a likely scenario. But honestly, I can’t think of another risk I’d rather take, ESPECIALLY if someone was gifting me the funds anyway (like in this tweet).
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:22:31
You could say the same thing about any early investment. There is inherent risk. If everyone knew that Amazon was going to explode we’d all be rich. Also, you don’t have to “buy bitcoin for 10,000” if you buy small portions of it through DCA methodology and accumulate it.

The asset class is 10 years old. What do you think other charts look like in their infancy? With time comes reduced volatility. Store of value opportunity now becomes also a reliable currency in the future once fluctuations subside.

I agree with your sentiment about the merit of his post, which is utter nonsense, but I still don’t think length of reddit account has any relevance. It just happens to fit your argument in this specific case. I’ve seen absolutely profound posts from accounts that are a week old.

I have posted before, but you don’t have to wait for funds to clear and you don’t have to pay the high CB fee... read below.
Use the Coinbase app to transfer funds from your bank to USD Wallet (that is free and instant). Then pull those funds over from USD Wallet on Coinbase using Coinbase Pro (also free and instant). Then put in your buy order for BTC using the USD you just sent over there. Now you are purchasing BTC with a lower transaction fee (around 0.25% instead of at least 1.5%).
When doing this you avoid the up-to-a-week delay of depositing directly to Coinbase Pro, and you also avoid the fee associated with purchasing BTC directly from the Coinbase app.
This is information I wish I had when first starting out.
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:33:43
That’s the trick. Coinbase Pro is not available through any App Store. You have to access it through URL via desktop PC or laptop.

Get a nano or use something like BRD app

Told ya :) And it has nothing to do with account age. You must have had a misstep along the way.
Last time I posted this info I had other people saying it doesn’t work. It does work. And it’s valuable info to a lot of people out there. So please be sure you are doing it correctly before commenting. If anything, ask if you are doing wrong rather than saying it’s ineffective. I appreciate that you updated your comment though.
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:42:06
It works. I do it all the time. I actually can’t believe nobody recommended it before i did.

The wedge is tightening. Whether we go up or down is anyone’s guess, but it will be dramatic movement nonetheless.
@_date: 2019-08-16 23:18:05
It’s up over 4000 from 4 months ago
@_date: 2019-08-08 21:07:43
The amount of time someone has been on reddit does not equate to BTC experience/knowledge. My humble opinion of course.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:42:09
How do I send you all of my money?

You should know better than to eat breakfast first. That was your mistake.

This could be true, but shouldn’t affect many people. I always leave a little on the exchange.

From a fee perspective it will be same as linked bank account. The fee occurs when transferring from BTC Wallet to USD Wallet within Coinbase. It’s always free to transfer from USD Wallet to bank account. It will be the same for PayPal.
Beyond that, yes, adding PayPal as a withdrawal option is great progress.
