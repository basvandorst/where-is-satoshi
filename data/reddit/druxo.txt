The current theoretical maximum of Bitcoin's protocol is between 3 - 7 transactions per second at 1MB block size. 
That is between 259200 - 604800 transactions allowed per day.
Say the average person only uses 10 transactions a day, that means the currect chain can only allow 25,000 to 60,000 people to use the blockchain.  Let's just say from now on 50,000 people
If we want to scale it to 500,000 people that means we need to increase the block size to 10MB.
Now that is still not enough, we need to allow it for 5,000,000 people.  Okay so 100MB. 
Now we need it for 50,000,000 people.  1000MB block size.
Now we need it for 500,000,000 pople.  10000MB block size.
5 billion people 100000 MB.
That is insane.  Not only that, is that is still only allow 10 transtions per person per day.  What if we want to take it beyond that, what if we want to allow each person to make a transaction per second?  The blocks would be insane and impossible with block size increases.
So what happens when it takes more than 10 minutes to validate a block for most users because the block is too big for them?  Well they can't and only groups with massive infrastructure and computing power could do that, and thus Bitcoin becomes centralized to only the groups that can handle that kind of throughput.
What we need is a proper scaling solution that allows for transactions to be handled off-chain and then settled on-chain when required.  Allowing users to freely use their Bitcoin as they see fit.
So why don't we just increase the block size a bit right now? Because it is not the right solution for scaling.  All efforts needs to be put into the proper scaling solution.  A band-aid fix is a waste of time and sends the wrong message.  Creating a hard-fork is a contentious thing and it would be tough to get everyone on board, even if that happens and everyone in the entire world agrees that increasing the block size to 10 MB is the right thing to do right now, what if that immediately fills up, and we are back to square one.  Should we do it again? Okay crap, 10 MB wasn't enough, better go to 100 MB now... well that is a slippery slope, and a slippery slope that can't be undone.  The damage that could cause would be unfixable.  We need to focus on a proper scaling solution and not on bandaids.

A soft fork is a change to the protocol that doesn't require all previous versions of the code to be updated.  Previous versions and the new versions can still work together, but older versions won't be able to use the new code. An example of this is the SegWit soft-fork. Nodes and wallets that don't use the SegWit fork still function on the blockchain, but don't use the SegWit features.
A hard-fork means there is no compatibility with the new software and the old software.  Hard forks can be contentious or not.  Example of a contentious hard-fork would be the switch over to BCh.  That was a hard-fork. There are also hard-forks that are not contentious, but those don't make the news as much.

Because they are unrelated.  Solving the answer to a block is a different calculation to verifying transactions that get included in a block. 
They are basically picking random a number to try to hash that gives them the number of leading zeros required to match the difficulty.  If you're interested in how the mining procedure works you could look it up. A quick Google found [this]( maybe it's helpful to you.  But to answer your question again.  Reducing the number of transactions they include will not speed up their ability to solve the problem.  It's just a guess and check with a random nonce.  Which is why it's in their best interested to pick the transactions with the highest fees and include as many as possible.

Waves coffee actually had the first-ever Bitcoin ATM in the entire world. However, I don't think that is the original.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:28:41
They can't. The difficulty tries to adjust based one the current hashing power to keep block times around 10 min. If they could solve the blocks instantly of course they would but they can't the block size isn't related to the difficulty. They are different calculations.

First - what the article is talking about. Bitcoin Cash is trying to hijack Bitcoin's brand, trying to trick users into thinking it's the real Bitcoin when it's not.
Now it doesn't really matter what site of the fence you're on, this is shady as fuck. You had your fork, you called it Bitcoin Cash, fine. But trying to trick innocent people into thinking it's Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash, that's low.
Beyond that, if you actually want to compare the two technologies, that is a different more complex story that has been beaten to death.

Let's give him a call and see what he thinks
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:26:30
You're right, it's up to the individual - so why are they trying to trick users into thinking it's the same thing?  They would do so on their own merits, not by shady tactics of confusing new users who don't know any better.
It's the way it all played out. Bitcoin Cash created a hard fork, maybe it's better, maybe it's not but there wasn't consensus on the hard fork and so the two chains continued. Great, everything is fine. If you believe in one or the other, then support it. I have no problem with that.  The problem arises when they are deliberately trying to confuse users by saying "this is Bitcoin" when it's not, it's Bitcoin Cash.

Awesome, thank you for the thoughtful answer.
I'm not sure I agree 100% with the thought about everyone benefiting because there is more wealth in the world than before.  I believe bitcoin itself lends it self to the thought that wealth is relative to what you believe wealth is. Also it's not like everyone gained from ASICs I am sure lots of people have lost, especially if you look at things in a larger scope than just those invested in bitcoin.  It almost seems like Newton's third law that for every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction. Obviously that is physics but I believe a similar concept applies here.
I know you didn't mean everyone as the literal everyone, but yeah, I understand what you mean.
