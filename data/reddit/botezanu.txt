Every time someone tries to 'debunk' this, they pick on the argument as the dude above mentioned that 'there is no mention of  'what type of pollution'. Well, I understand it might not be 100% the same as what a car would do, but it's still fucking pollution.

I've been using blockchain.info since it first launched. I tried and tested every single fucking wallet out there and every time I went back to blockchain.info.
the only reason I ever tested others is due to the bad press on blockchain.info so I thought 'Might as well check, maybe it's a lot better out there and I don't even know it'.
Bullshit. I have all my damn Bitcoin with blockchain.info and nothing ever went even slightly wrong. As long as you aren't an idiot and enable email backups while having no 2FA anywhere, not on your email, not on your account, and do not login from a damn internet cafe, you'll be fine.
blockchain.info is secure and trustwhorthy. It's the masses of idiots who don't know what 'be your own bank' actually means, expecting bank-grade security without all the 'hassle' who are the problem.

You do realise more 'gasoline' (oil) goes into producing and maintaining the car, than what the car actually uses? What do you think the paint is made from, the electronics, the plastics, the tires themselves, plus all the oil being used to power the industries that create those things.
If you buy a car, buy it because you need it, not because it's electric - it won't make a difference to anyone or anything, not even if all the cars in the world would go electric.
Think about this: The worlds biggest 15 cargo ships create more pollution than all the cars in the world combined.

Well I did not expect that answer. Thank's for the information, I'll check out both suggestions (actually my question was directly prompted by me seeing the HiddenWallet thing going around the sub today).

Yeah. Noticed this as well. Worth a good read. I've since switched over to /v/bitcoin - using both at the moment and you can see a massive difference between them.
