Maybe, but she's Boring in bed.

I'm so, so sorry, but you're in my way.

I don't really *want* to host anything, but I haven't found another solution.

Non-hosted but off-chain? Sounds like I have to write it myself.

I was starting to wonder whether forking greenaddress might be the way to go, but this includes the source for the server.

I wanted to link to my [previous question about pocket-money]( which has now become: what can I use to do off-chain transactions on a non-hosted wallet? ie I want to have my multiple accounts for multiple users sharing a single wallet, which I will have to host myself.
Do I have to start with the Bitcoin API itself, or is some of this already written?

Thanks, but I want to include an 11 YO.

Their [terms]( don't seem to exclude anyone. Can I schedule payments with them?

This is very specific advice - do you know of anything else on github that uses these libraries?
@_date: 2015-08-04 22:11:25
I explained in the linked post (titled "Bitcoin pocket money (not coinbase)") why that was unacceptable.

That allows me to do off-chain transactions without the over 18 ToS, but not set them up on a schedule - I'd have to script that myself. BTW, I don't think there's a wallet either.
