 Regulation means acceptance, legal acceptance, by nation state governments. This is a good thing. 
Note: I haven't read the article yet.  If FUD, I'll edit this. 
Edit: just read it.. not even enough material to be considered FUD. Yes, dip off of high close to 20k... that's it. As for protecting their citizens.. yes .. do it.  And if regulation can do that.. correctly, then it legitimizes BTC as an accepted currency.  Basically.. keep it going

Ledger supports multiple currency.. so if that's not working, it's something their support should definitely help with.. that being said, I know they support eth.. no clue about bcash.
That being said, if you do not like it, get software wallets  for each on your computer or phone.. send them there.. keep your private keys safe.  You can sell your ledger.. DO NOT LEAVE COIN ON IT OF YOU SELL IT.  Reset it immediately *if you plan on selling it*.
I can tell you, I struggle with mine and mainly use another wallet.. but I can recover it into my ledger if needed. Doing this allows offline storage of funds.. which means little risk of someone stealing coin through compromise of your laptop or your phone.

 Gdax/CB holds it... if you read this sub, you will see countless complaints about their support. 
Ledger has more to it than a 5 dollar "usb stick". Small company... and support needs to grow.. mine has struggled many times. 
That being said.. there's no need to get angry at the bitcoin community in general.  A slight tone adjustment might make others help out a lot more. Also, you might find stuff on YouTube that can help. 
Through someone else's comment, I recognize you're a common poster on T_D. Although I disagree with nearly everything that goes on in that sub, your question here was clearly not related to that, but to bitcoin... you don't need to bring the same approach to communication here. We get enough of that from r/btc folk.

Hubs would only be subject to regulation and oversight in certain countries... right? Yes there's a risk of theft, but financial responsibility is part of what bitcoin is supposed to teach/instill already.
Also, banks charge monthly fees, overage fees and interest on loans to make money... backed by a proper initially unlimited supply of an inflationary currency. Bitcoin is still limited, the regulatory requirements for documentation can be automated and the network of hubs isn't necessarily a bad idea. The revolution is against the banks and centrally controlled fiat supplies, the lightning channels can be peer to peer or part of a larger network... and given the hubs would be in the same approach, these would be with individuals who already have a large supply, for example Satoshi if he/ she/ they were to return or Andreas ... or if Ver sees the light, him. 
I already maintain a balance in venmo and PayPal.. basically, I'm using a fiat implementation of lightning as described by this video... it works beautifully and yes, there's risk.. and ways to mitigate, like two factor, multi signature confirmation for sending value... it's about how it gets implemented.

^^ This... outbound you'll need to make sure you can reach other nodes... ISPs are notorious for not having all pets open, for example, you can't run an internet accessible mail server on a residential plan since it uses a port they might consider to be for "business".. or you can't connect directly to SMTP servers that don't belong to the ISP ... 
This might be their way to attempt to control what people do on their network. Inbound port forwarding is one thing, outbound port access is the other.

Although I disagree on hubs ending up regulated in practice, I see where you're coming from. 
As for the mempool, yes, backlogged.. but double spending can be attempted, not actually executed, right? The transactions would fail and not get confirmed.. as to it being full, with larger SegWit adoption, it should help reduce the backlog significantly.. this would be most beneficial if/ when all major exchanges implement SegWit and promote use of SegWit wallets to newcomers.

I would probably pick one up. Coinopoly could have it's own ledger that converts its fake  fiat into crypto during ownership of property and uses an accompanying mobile app... basically.. include a raspberry pi, or similar, with a very centralized ledger (one machine) that is reset for each game .. my brother collects monopoly games.. this would be a nice addition.

Although I can afford to lose what fiat value I put into BTC.... I would still prefer to survive in the world of fiat if necessary since I like my approach to life than fully lose any fiat equivalence of BTC. 
I'll be disappointed if it goes to 0.. but at last I know how the current corrupt system works, and I'll be able to monitor for changes (I.e. new US tax plan) in order to maximize my use of fiat in exchange for life comforts.

 "Receive" will provide you a wallet address... copy that one, go to gdax, then "send" .. or "withdraw" (I think that's the term they use).. to BTC address... paste the address.  Before clicking the confirmation button, confirm the address, the first 6 characters are the same... the last 6 characters are the same... chances are you're good... I'd toy want to verify all.. do it. Then click the confirmation... wait a bit.. then it's in  your wallet.

My dad asked me if it made sense to buy a full coin.. I said it could, but to be risk averse it wouldn't make sense. My brother is a finance guy and told him it was too risky.. my dad is almost retiring... so the risk is very high if there's a crash like 2013 where it takes years to recover, if at all. 
My dad talked to my brother at 16k... I told my dad about it at 8k and bought at 8900. 
I don't talk to my brother about finance because he is super smart in current market model... he's a tech person too and mathematician, but I don't think he's read the white paper, and I think he's been focused on work too much to dedicate time to understand the potential disruption... I may have dedicated too much time, including reading the white paper, articles, watching videos, debates, and watching the price changes. 
I'm hodling my dad's ... I'm hodling mine ... I started 2 months ago to learn and get in... I'm a relative noob but I feel like I understand not just the tech, but the goal. A year ago, I was too concerned about not understanding that I never bothered to learn. I kick myself every day for not dedicating the time before.. the three or four years ago when I heard about BTC...  
If it weren't for my two friends, I would have never gotten in. They hinted at but didn't push and allowed me to use the trust in them to build my own desire to learn. 
When my dad told my mom he invested, my mom said that it was risky.. and that maybe it's too late.. when my dad said it was 500 and when I said it was my fiat to minimize their risk.. she said "oh..I thought you had done a full coin".. needless to say they aren't as concerned now... although my mom keeps telling me to pull my initial investment and let the profits ride. I'm not ready for that due to taxes.. waiting on long term capital to rake effect.

Yea.. I bought my dad some at 8900... the fat it climbed up from 8k... I told him it was risky so I didn't take his cash but instead bought it for him. He's learning in his own and talks about it more than I do with his friends and co-workers. He sees everyone who is cautious about the "bubble"... I explained the deflationary concept, p2p trust model and approaches to maintaining a secure protocol through BIP and consensus... not to mention the concept of secure wallets.. And keeping keys. 
For now I'm holding his BTC, but will walk him through setting up a wallet at some point in the near future.  Yesterday: "So... if it hits a million, those 500 would be worth about 50k"... I replied in the affirmative but told him to not get his hopes up... I'm being overly cautious and risk averse with him on this... but for now.. he's enjoying it.

I hesitate with multisig for this because that's the initiation of the transfer... and that assumes an eBay wallet for each user or sale.

This might be more confusing.

I don't know necessarily.. but I would assume that the optimal level of decentralization would be the amount that would allow for the maximum amount of full nodes/miners without bogging down the underlying network to the point of introducing excessive lag and making the efficiency of the decentralized ledger impossible. The "underlying network" in this case being the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:28:09

@_date: 2017-12-30 20:16:48
If the underlying infrastructure supporting the system cannot hold it up, then yes.. it's too much.  Over time, the internet improves.. so the number for 'too much' gets higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:49:48
My thought is that if this happens, a network to translate between BTC and any state sponsored coin will be required. My thought is that it should actually go more granular... local financial jurisdictions that have city based currency to keep major networks from flooding with transactions. Escrow wallets will need to be available to convert between those to a global crypto currency, whatever that would be. 
A fork would give a ton of US sanctioned buying power to a lot of people outside of the country.. including a ton to China. I guess that doesn't change much from the dollar.

Unless they have their own "escrow wallet", in which case the buyer would need to confirm receipt of product, with acceptable condition, to release funds to seller.

Sure looks like a fear mongering title. Spear phishing.. means targeted, not everyone getting hit... and the targets are insiders in the crypto space. Keep your coin on your wallet, keep your keys secure and you have little chance of being targeted. 
If you're one of the targets, learn about security and keep your eye open for potential phishing emails.. you'll be safe. 
Most important: DON'T CLICK ON RANDOM LINKS!  Try to use your own bookmarks... verify links when in the address bar before putting in your authentication information, double check addresses when you copy paste to send and always check to make sure HTTPS is working.

Maybe because it seems like they are so it makes the question a dumb one.. but considering that Ver said the sports line multiple times and it feels like the same tone...

There's no "and co".. it's not outdated, it's building an infrastructure.  The OSI model approach may not apply.. but something similar could.. LN could be layer 2, something else could be.  25 years ago, we had ARPANet.. today we have the internet.  While it's not 1 to 1 as an example..I would closely relate network topology as the example, star topology, ring topology, etc. BIP ensures evolution into the best topology for the network, the best approach will be "discovered" "eventually" .. the best approach will change with the times and consensus will implement. 
The main difference with the internet and this specific "original implementation" of blockchain is that the internet didn't start with the thought to be secure.. while bitcoin was designed specifically to take the CIA triad into account. This is why I believe BTC has value.. paired with the decentralization factor and open source nature, which ensures no one person or organization has full control. 
Other coin, "alt coins" may have value too... this isn't winner take all.. this is "identify the right application for the technology" which means there may be multiple blockchain implementations cohabiting ... in different use cases.. BTC is had its design in store and transfer of value... other implementations have other use cases.. like eth for smart contracts. 
Just my opinion.

Global conspiracy for price manipulation? There are exchanges on almost every continent... I would understand some manipulation maybe... South Korea pays a premium right now, but they are ahead for adoption... 
The criminal piece also got me... the best thing for criminals would be cash... not something with an open ledger that has the ability to be easily tracked through exchanges and then to fiat accounts... to compare these would be to give the example of using cash and being able to compare the serial numbers and tie them directly to bank accounts.. but also knowing all the middle men between non bank transactions.

One of the first to bring up the fact that credit cards don't pay up immediately... so when I buy coffee with my card, the business owner still risks something with the transaction being canceled.  The 20 hour wait is still more reliable and as quick to use after that than cash, but available online without the need to deposit into a fiat bank... which then might take more time to confirm. 
Out also removes the risk of counterfeit bills, which when its 2 bucks for coffee, people might not check for regularly.

If they don't feel comfortable with it yet, direct them to "coin cast".. it's a French language crypto currency podcast that is relatively good at explaining crypto currency based out of Europe (I'm guessing Paris) , although a couple of stumbles to get on the same page.  It's a newer podcast, 2 episodes from October 24 and 31.
Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with that podcast, just to do my own research and learning, subscribed to a bunch of podcasts, this ones just happened to be in French, I just happened to speak the language.

I agree that herd mentality might impact this but I think people will be divided in this situation: those who understand the tech and maybe millennials on one side, and everyone else on the other. This may further push the crypto revolution if the former group ends up on top while the latter ends up on the bottom.. this could lead to a huge shift of wealth in this country and lead to a similar shift worldwide. 
These are just opinions, I'm not a futurist nor a historian, I'm just extrapolating what might happen based on my interpretation of herd mentality and risk aversion based on understanding if trends and technology.

I agree... and yes, rather interesting that she jumped into a risk to homeland security, when it's really not a physical risk to the homeland. It's a risk to the financial sector in this country, which is why other departments should get involved, and organizations like the fed. This may be a huge threat to our current financial infrastructure if not properly understood... that would eventually lead to a DHS concern, but that's not where they should jump to yet.

@_date: 2019-01-02 18:18:21


Yup... ethics and morals have changed depending on societal changes, usually getting better for the masses, but not always. I do not believe in an _objective morality._
A _fantastical claim_ isn't meant to make them seem bad or good..  simply saying that they are fantastical, in other words: claims that are beyond the natural and explicable through common understanding and science. 
As for morally wrong to kill someone, it impacts the value of the person being killed and the value of the killer in the community for the social species, making them less important, perhaps shunned, which could lead to less biological value for the continuation of the species. This is how a social species would react to this, although we also understand that human psyche is still interesting and we have a lot to learn to better understand why some potential mates are attracted to these outliers in society. Psychology as a science is sometimes ridiculed or misunderstood... the one thing it can help with is predictive behavior, this is why behavioral analytics can be used to study serial killers. 
That being said, with subjective morality, we deal with regular changes overall, hence a lot of people approving of the death penalty as a moral punishment for crimes perpetrated by the individual in question. Also, in times of sacrifices, it wasn't seen as immoral to kill someone for that purpose, I.e. old native cultures in central Mexico where humans were sacrificed to ensure the sun continued to rise. 
It's all subjective and culture based, designed to ensure our social species can continue to survive in an ever changing community that waxes and wanes in size and interaction with other communities while forming a larger community identity with better communication.

You either forgot the "/s" or assume a gender associated with "whom" while using "sir" and assuming a gender identity for me. Not sure which. 
Either way, I am biologically male and also happen to conform to that gender due to... wait for it, that just being what I identify as. 
So if a joke, fair enough... haha,  get your chuckle in.  If for real, let's calm down a bit... OP posted a joke and it was in the context of traditional binary gender identities, nothing wrong with that. Also, an ex of mine is well versed in the technology, I am well versed in the technology. Oh, and I am straight... so my ex is of the opposite gender. I know the joke from OP is just a joke. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 00:44:51
I disagree. Morality (morals) may have natural origins which can be analyzed through science. 
One _might_ say that... but it's closer to the following: 
Religion is to fantastical claims what science is to validation of data.
Edit: you changed morality to "Morals". I still disagree and my analogy still stands for my view on this. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:25:03
By taking their life, any potential future value becomes null... so it changes their value by default whether in a negative or positive way depending on the person and what they contribute to _society_... I'm not talking about value to an individual, but to the overall community.  
As for personal value as the killer, their perceived value wouldn't shift in regards to society of it isn't attributed to them, but by having killed, even if not caught, they have directly impacted the community by potentially cutting short a viable reproductive entity from the community. So, in that context, no, it would still not be moral. 
If you're trying to get me to say that murder is moral, you won't. If you're going to go through the self defense argument next, I would say that it's better to _not kill_ in self defense when possible, but it would be seen as justifiable if defending/protecting other lives. 
Honestly, I think this discussion might not belong on this sub, maybe try moving it to r/debateanatheist, r/debateachristian or r/atheism ... but if you continue to try to get me to validate morality of murder as a non believer, or get to get me to say it's always immoral and the only way for that to happen is through an objective morality sourced by a higher, supernatural power, you will not succeed.

It's usually the belief systems that align with the community values, not the other way around. As for value... I'm referring to value they provide to the ongoing survival of the species, through emotional support, procreation or any other intrinsic value we attribute to individuals. 
I reject stories with lack of evidence. It's not about "believing" in science... it's about confidence in results, trusting the method and the fact that science wants to be proven wrong... belief systems tend to place value on not being falsifiable. That's bad. Also, it's an _us vs them_ mindset often, which is counterproductive.  As for their fantastical claims, they wouldn't be fantastical if they could be reproduced, replicated, proven to be viable. Until we see a talking snake or a chariot levitating to the heavens from atop a mountain, they will be fantastical.

I don't disagree with your point on nihilism, but for morality, there's an argument to be made on its evolutionary origins, especially for social species. Religion has no claim to morality. 
Comprehending morality is a byproduct of our consciousness and self awareness paired with our lack of fully understanding the view point of times past, despite our empathy. 
I agree that religion is more than naive worship of a deity, many religions have multiple deities and many have none
