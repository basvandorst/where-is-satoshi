Yes to say your way is more accurate because 50 MA is faster and crosses the 200 MA not the other way around.

The first time I saw it I was pleasantly surprised. Now it is at many locations.

If I change the log scale to linear it will be more clear for last year's parabolic run. We dropped from $5000 to $3500 (approx) and then the bullish run started end of September
Here is the linear chart [

Logarithmic price scales tend to show less severe price increases or decreases than linear price scales. For example, if an asset price has collapsed from $100.00 to $10.00, the distance between each dollar would be very small on a linear price scale. Logarithmic price scales solve these problems by adjusting the prices based on the percent change. In other words, a significant percentage move will always correspond with a significant visual move on logarithmic price scales.

I don't think I understand your concern. It instantly converts fiat cash to bitcoin and transfers to your wallet.

Some do both ways but not the one in the picture.

Next major support is at $3000 (approx)

Yes I am speculating. I am also speculating when it starts to go up it will go beyond $100,000 but not this year although I would like to see that.
