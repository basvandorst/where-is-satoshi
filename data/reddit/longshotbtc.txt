I have many images of my early drives.  Unfortunately I did not keep all of them.  Regardless, there is still a good chance that wallet.dat will show up on one of them.  If I cannot easily find it, then I'll try file carving.
Thank you for your help.  If you find that another file name could hold the coins, then please let me know.  I'll also try searching for the scan tool that you point out.
Thanks again!

Hey, sorry for taking so long.
The updates so far:
* I have now found a total of 11 drives that could contain the wallet.
* I finally figured out how to physically access my old PATA drives and how to run pywallet on Windows.
* I have many image files to restore to a blank disc to look for the wallet.
* I'm using pywallet's command line interface to search for deleted keys on every drive and image.
This will probably take quite a while.  I'll update here what the results are.
Thanks again for your help!

I already know that, but don't want to get my hopes up too high.  I think that I ran it for at least 24 hours, but I just don't trust my memory.  
At this point, I need to worry more about if I still have access to them.
I kind of remember getting block solved results several times per minute.
None of my memory matters if I cannot find the results.
I'm working on finding them and will update this thread with what I find.

Thank you.
I've got 5 additional drives to search.  I'm trying to clone each one before searching, so this will take some time.
Thanks again for your help.  If I find an old wallet.dat file then I'll be back here asking for help for how to access it.  
Hopefully this isn't a "Turkey Hunt".
Once again, thank you for helping me.  I'll update this post in the next day or two with what I found.
