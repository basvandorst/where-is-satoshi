I think it has less to do with FUD and more to do with an arbitrage opportunity. If the futures are trading at a lower price than the spot market near expiry, people can simply buy on the futures market and sell at the spot market and they get a sure profit. The inverse is true if the futures are trading at a premium.

I'm assuming you meant bottom right corner. Those blue message boxes are notifications of liquidated positions entering the market.

Thanks for catching that error

It's pathetic how there are so many sites are trying to be act as reporters, but failing to such a miserable degree in doing so. It is such sites and their second-class interpretation of events that is leading to all that FUD.

I have read your entire comment five times now and I am still failing to understand what is it that you are trying to say.
@_date: 2018-09-01 03:22:11
I'm afraid my recent track records support your comment all too well...
But we all need some of that hope cocktail anyway

In retrospect, it was always all too obvious...

I'm still in university, and this is always my reaction when I ask my parents when they decline my advice of putting some money in bitcoin :(
Can't wait to get a job and earn some money to invest.

You've probably run out of money trying to buy those never-ending dips

\*ahem\* It's not 'investing' if you enter at the top.

Looks like your TA was spot on

Thanks for explaining your strategy! Greatly appreciated. However, allow me to explain mine:
I've noticed that BTC has always dropped right before the expiry of a futures contract (sometimes backwardation, sometimes for no apparent reason at all). The drops have varied in magnitude, but there always has been one. I was short at 7046, waiting for the futures to end trading. The plan was to cover my shorts and go long as soon as that happened. If you look at the chart, 9:45 am CT was the time when the charts of BTCQ2018 froze and BTC started moving upwards: that was the time when the futures stopped trading.
I was expecting that to happen at 4 pm CT, which is stated in CME's official website as the time when the futures stop trading. I'm not sure why it stopped so early, or if I have the wrong information.

You mean Australian srallod?

At least now it is known that shorting it before the dump will give you some good returns.

And I was just about to start margin trading monero on Poloniex. 
Glad I saw this post. Now I'm gonna give it a second thought.

Oh I'm telling you the guys at SEC are on shorts right now

The deadline for the decision on the VanEck SolidX ETF is the 30th of Sep. An announcement on the decision can be any day before that.

Uh that fucking dip to 6880 just triggered the stop-loss of my long position on BitMEX.
Life was already sucky, and something just had to make it suckier.
