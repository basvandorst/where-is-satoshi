If there ever was a moral high ground for DDoSing, this is it. If Coinbase down = Low tx fees for everyone.

This is a security flaw. They should really not place so much trust in central chinese mining pools. Even the hardware vendor, Bitmain is getting out of the country

The Roman coin - dēnārius was made up of ten assēs. Under Augustus, the Roman army was increased in size and promised more pay. However, when the time came and they demanded their wages, the emperor did not have enough in the treasury, so he ordered each coin to be reduced in weight, ie shaved of assēs.  
Moral of the story, don't join the army.

Yeah, that's one of the liberals fraiding in the citis. Real people freed from the routine explored the world with a smile and whistle, barely a bit to their name.

I always regret going back to 1998
