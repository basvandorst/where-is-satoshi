Stop, halt, do not continue.  Nobody do this.  This is absolutely idiotic.  cryptodude1 you should get a new username.
No scanner or camera is capable of taking the exact pixel-for-pixel same image of a document when you scan it twice.  If you have the slightest shift in any single area of your entire document (dimensions, cropping, colors, alignment) your cryptographic hash[1] will change.  At this point your image is just a not particularly great and very cumbersome source of entropy and does not solve the "Don't want to remember a long password?" question that you originally posed.
Please, for the love of Bitcoin Jesus, downvote this idiot.
[1] There are functions that can hash images and can deal with the noise you get from cameras and scanners.  The OP doesn't mention them (probably because he's an idiot) but I would still be reluctant to use them for private key material because of entropy and guessability concerns.

In the united states taxes are (for the most part) self-reported.  The burden of getting it right is on the taxpayer and the choice to evade taxes and not report anything at all is also available to the taxpayer.  The IRS only proves things in a tax court case where they can use their forensic accounting tools and traditional legal tools like subpoenas.  In that case they can get things that tie you to addresses and purchases and you're fucked. :)
So once again, bitcoin is exactly like everything else in the tax system.  You can throw up your hands and say "reporting cap gains on this stock is too hard, too many details" and if the IRS catches you they'll come down hard.  If you say "wallet was stolen" they still have those legal/accounting tools to charge you.

Your understanding of cap gains is incorrect.  Gold is personal property that has the special collectible classification - it is still personal property.  Bitcoin is also personal property.
Edit: the IRS' ruling today is consistent with their system.  Once again, if you were actually familiar with taxation today's ruling is not a surprise as its the logical and fair way to treat it (within the current system).

Putting this in my claim chowder file :)

Its not a minor and temporary problem, the entire security and merchant trust of the network relies on nobody being able to break 51%.
On top of that remember that rising difficulty and shrinking block reward means that miner revenues will always slowly shrink.  It could be possible for a "go hard, burn out the network and cash out when it goes up in flames" strategy to be more profitable if the present value of all those ever decreasing payouts is less than the kill the network profit.

I'm not sure what scenario you're talking about.  If you keep bitcoins in bitcoin (hid the keys) that is not taxable because you're not making any exchanges.  If you traded the bitcoins for a good or service the IRS can find about that in several ways (looking at fiat bank accounts, search warrants and the other forensic accounting tricks) and that counts as evidence.  If you went super sneaky and bought virtual services over tor they won't find it, but if you get unlucky and they do you're fucked beyond measure.  Generally most transactions are going to not be of the sneaky entirely virtual type so most btc tax evasion can be prosecuted.

You cash out along the way and obviously you get everything out before it hits zero.  I don't think it'll drop to zero in an instant and there will be plenty of time to exit your position.

I agree that the parent is retarded but its not that unheard of - social security is the largest holder of tbills...

Only it doesn't, as the person who hosts the servers can point them wherever they want.  A contract can't help you against a bad actor.

He's absolutely clueless, gold is personal property just like a bit coin is or a potato is.  This whole thread is being up voted by people with no understanding of the tax code.
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:08:16
So if you mine coins and say "whoops the keys are gone" you fall into the tor category I mentioned.  You can be sneaky but as soon as you cash out into tangible things you start creating a trail for forensic accountants.

Once again, did you read the article?  He's gone by Dorian Nakamoto for decades and even had a legal name change.
Edit: and that means a Google search for satoshi won't turn up anything obvs.

There's still no advantage and several disadvantages over using a RNG.  It doesn't solve the "Don't want to remember a long password?" question that he posed in his own post and misleads people into thinking it does.
If you used an RNG to crank out a few thousand bytes of entropy, ascii armored it and burned it to a CD/printed it out you'd get the same functionality in a more convenient process than  what OP is proposing.

No, because p2p pools still mine at a fixed proportion of the network hashrate.  For some small miners it already has put them out of mining on p2ppool and this problem will continue to grow as the network grows.
