Downloading pirated material off of the internet is also "banned", but enforcement is a whole other deal :)

I won't be wasting my bitcoin on any politician.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:59:17
Good :)
@_date: 2013-05-12 10:52:05
You can buy shares? How?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:36:25
Oh ok, thanks for the clarity. I was just a bit confused, because I've never had that happen to me before. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 00:39:32
I wish they did
@_date: 2013-05-12 00:11:51
Thanks for the clarity. Learning about bitcoin has its difficulties, but I would be completely lost without people like you :)
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:02:09
Hell yeah, I'm noticing!

I'm actually waiting on a pizzaforcoins order right now. This will be my second time using them. There was a slight issue with my first Oder with them, but I sent an email to support which was responded to immediately, and they even threw in a free soda for the mix up :) great service!
@_date: 2013-05-10 09:35:58
In my wallet please lol
@_date: 2013-05-10 03:00:26
Thank you for the tip BTW. It's helping me understand it a bit more. Now, is there a way that I could possibly use an address I already have instead of one that is automatically generated for me?

This approach is far to lax any person who actually cares about the protection of his/her bitcoins. If after following these steps a person manages to have their bitcoins stolen, they absolutely deserve it for doing so very little to protect them.

Sorry, but I believe that voting is an act of aggression, and I choose not to take any part of any political action (that I am not forced to at the tip of a gun). I understand that some may not agree, but I'm ok with that.
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:25:50
Thanks....although I am still a bit lost. Sometimes certain things take a while to sink in lol but I'll continue looking into it.
@_date: 2013-05-31 07:29:32
Of course they do, but they can't :) They can make things difficult, and I'm sure they will for a time, but in the end there's nothing they can do. MWAHAHAHA!!!!

I certainly will not be assisting any politician in any way, especially with my bitcoins.

This applies to debit also?
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:19:20
Uh....no. I'm not into bitcoin because I want to have to beg the government (in the form of payment) for permission. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 21:51:25
Agreed, but that doesn't help me right now while I'm stuck at my place of employment, plus there's a huge language barrier. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 00:00:24
Again, this does nothing for me today, and I'm sure busy business owners don't have time to wait while I attempt (poorly) to ask them to accept bitcoins in their native tongue. I think I'll attempt to learn mandarin anyway though.

I don't think it's unrealistic to expect not to pay taxes to people claiming to be government. I don't owe those people a thing. You may feel differently about yourself, but that's just you. ,Also I haven't paid a dime in taxes on any of the Bitcoin I've cashed out. I buy and sell person to person whenever possible. It's one thing to voluntarily agree to pay a company a fee for using their service that you've chosen, but it's a completely different story for some uninvited third party to claim any part of your personal property at the point of a gun for any reason. So, if being "treated like everyone else" is basically being treated like a slave, then I certainly do not want to be treated like everyone else, and have no intention of acting like everyone else.

Thanks for this :)
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:17:51
This is awesome! Continue spreading love :)

I just can't win today lol! I'm the only staff member on shift for the whole day :/
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:09:43
I would absolutely love this. Bitcointip is awesome, but I would like to be able to understand it a but better than I do currently, an I tend to learn better from people speaking plain English. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:56:14
That's really good work. I'm also learning blender, but it appears your learning method may be more effective than mine lol Any suggestions on learning resources? 
@_date: 2013-05-18 17:01:32
Right, why not just use the debit option for buying, and avoid credit fees? I'm sure there may be some sort of fee, but I assume less than credit. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 16:05:24
I don't want the government having anything to do with my money, and that's the whole reason I hold bitcoin. Ugh! Some people don't get it. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:22:07
I'd be very willing to pay a $5 fee to do this, but not more. If you're worried about making a profit, just offer the lowest price, and easiest service. The amount if business you get will make up for the low fee by a lot.
