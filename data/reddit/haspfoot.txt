I did read your post. My main point is that many regulations are designed for enforcement after the fact. If at some point in the future you get audited, or the government comes to learn about the transaction they've got an extra charge to slap onto a person. They may never find out, but if they do they've got something extra to use against you. 
For example a state passed a law requiring drug dealers to pay tax on the sales of illicit drugs. I think the tax stamps could be bought at the gov't office. So now when they catch a drug dealer they don't just charge them w the regular narco laws, they get to slap on some tax evasion. 
So you're right, so long as your use of crypto leaves behind no evidence you'll be fine. At the time of the transaction the government has no idea crypto was used. But if you get audited/investigated and your personal financial life doesn't seem to balance, you'll have some legal trouble.

While I think that drives some of the value statement crypto does have some other intrinsic value in regards to democratization of global financial transactions. With the decentralized nature people could transact with anyone in the world faster and potentialy cheaper than looping through the banks.

No sorta about it. You leverage arbitrage to get essentialy free mining hardware +  a little extra. The BTC plus the extra on resale payoff your capx.
Continued operation to stay competitive with difficulty and to maintain the same rate of profit requires a contant churn to newest hardware. So your profits are primarily tied to the hardware reseller market, not the solar part of the equation.

I think they mentioned diamonds in reference to psychology and its potential impact on the market. I think this comparison is a good one to illustrate the point. 
People are willing to pay a large sum for a stone of a certain size. And while we're all "in" on crypto currency we must remember there are people out there that just consider bitcoin an abstract computer thing and for them a bitcoin is equally as useless as a clear stone. 
So if people are willing to pay big money for a large rock (of little true value) they might do the same with a bitcoin. The key difference is a bitcoin has more intrinsic value than a clear stone and is truly scarce. This could lead to staggering prices. 
Tldr; Marketing made something worthless worth a bunch, imagine what it could do to something valuable.

Just to be clear. You bought the miner for apx 1200 usd and at the end you sell for apx 1500?
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:25:13
So 6,800 is the cost from the non miner infrasteucture? Thats still 400 days to break even at .007 BTC per day. How much do you buy one miner for and on average how much do you earn selling it used?

Tbh it sounds like the lion's share of profit is coming from flipping the mining hardware you preordered. It would be cool though if you could link a google sheet with the numbers you're talking about. Listing all the hardware, purchase price, operational costs, maintenance cost, and replacement schedules. Basically I'm keen to see your TCO on a per kwh basis. Could you show a complete cycle for a particular mining rig as well? So we can see how many btc were produced by each miner over x time? Or could you share your annual profit seperate from the sales of the unused miners?
When ever I've crunched the numbers for my capabilities I've always found it more cost effective, and quicker to profit, to just buy BTC on exchanges. It goes without saying that if a person's primary concern with BTC is anonymity then this isn't an option.  
My quick math estimate puts the payoff time of a mining station as stated above to be apx 420 days (at your 18 USD mined per day). In May 2016 the highest price for BTC was 550 usd (per investing.com). Today its apx 2400.  This represents a 336% profit.  So your 25 rigs represent 200,000 USD in upfront costs. Which if put straight into bitcoin would be worth 672,000 USD. 
It sounds like you're really into this, and you're exactly the kind of person that makes crypto great. We all have our own motivations and interests. We all are somewhere on the spectrum between hobbyists, business people, upto market level fx. Keep rockin! Would love to see your details.

I said Primarily tied to the profitable churn of mining hardware. Not exclusively tied to the hardware churn. 
To show the mining activity as a primary driver lay out what happens if you are no longer able to resell the used miners for more than you bought them.   So run us through your model numbers with the following assumptions: no new hardware, just mine with the rigs running right now. When taking difficulty into account, how many coins will you mine in the next 6 month, 1 year, 2 years?
Edit: so based on the number crunch in the child comment you earn about 25 pct profit for each hardware flip. You earn apx 4 pct vs your solar capx per hardware generation. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:35:04
Ok. So assume your arbitrage on hardware remains consistent for another year. What will be your ROI over this two years?

Didn't realize I lived in a police state. I've sold cars in two different states. They both were pretty similar. They required you to transfer the title of a car. It had a question on if it were a gift or sale. If it were a sale, you had to put in a dollar value. State then wanted the sales tax on that. If it was a gift you had to fill out an extra form stating it was a gift.  I once sold a car to a buddy for cheap and the state (TN) asked why the sale price was so low, so I had to fill out an addendum that the sale price was low due to extensive non-saftey repairs required.
I didn't say anything about submiting digital proof of anything. Just talking about a paper trail that would be created in most states.  
What state do you live in where there is no paper work required to transfer a vehicle to someone?
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:41:33
Are you? Based on your numbers you've spent 200,000 USD to get 25 mining rigs setup. Have you mined more than 83 btc in this time? Cause at current market rate thats how many you need to be close to break even. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:30:54
So the headline here is you leverage hardware cost arbiratge and use those profits to pay off solar capx and buy extra capacity to mine.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:05:27
Not forgetting any of that. 
Exclude the profit from flipping miners. That can be done without doing any actual mining.
Exclude possible future values of BTC. Base it on the price today, or the past month's average. We could all say we're profitable of we cherry pick some hypothetical future value.
Lets look at the 25 rigs you have hooked up to solar. What is your calculated cost per kwh over the lifetime of the solar rig and equipment? It looks like the startup cost is around 200,000 USD. Are you in posession of 83+ BTC? I ask because .007 BTC × 25 rigs is .175 BTC per day. So thats 420 days to break even. How much profit have you actualy made as of right now, excluding hardware flips? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:37:49
Wait so are you saying you buy a miner for apx 1200, use it for several weeks then sell it for 1500? If so then there is no question about making profit. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:56:34
Crunched it myself. A 4.7 TH miner will produce .12 BTC over the next 700 days. So the profit is low and limited. To sustain the growth you've got you *need* the hardware churn.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:59:12
So why don't you? Fill us in? Do I get to hand wave away my computer cost since I already own it and use it for seperate purposes? Also, my emplpyeer pays for my electricity. 
If it doesn't work out then I'll just pick a different hypothetical BTC value! Lol
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:21:48
I think people are incredulous due to lack of hard numbers, the poster mixing profits from hardware arbitrage, and the solar rig mining. Add in that profit also seems to take into account some future value of BTC. 
When asked to post numbers they refuse. The solar rig for 25 miners cost 200,000 USD. They need more than 83 BTC (or a mix of BTC and USD equivalent) to make a profit. At their claimed rate of .007 BTC/day per miner thats 420 days of mining to break even at today's BTC cost. 
If we mix in the resale of the used miners at 300 USD (per post) that still puts the cost at 192,500 USD. So being generous for the resale they still need to have produced 80 BTC to break even. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:33:59
Ok. So lay it on us. What's your ROI? That's what we're trying to figure out here. Just give us the headline if you want. Exclude money made by hardware arbitrage (for hardware that wasn't actually mining). From your start date what is your total USD cost, and as of now what is your USD + BTC gains?
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:44:50
Post the numbers! Your costs per your post are 200,000 USD. Do you have 83 or more BTC? Or have you actually earned more than 200,000 USD when you exclude the flipping of hardware? If so how much? What's the rate of return?
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:46:44
They don't need to stop it. Just criminalize it. You do the transaction. The part w the car creates a paper trail. Generally the sale amount in USD gets listed (depending on state). If the value written is below a threshold you may need to do some paperwork. Then some taxes might be owed on the sale. 
Eventually a big-data driven algo run by the government pings you for audit. Then they start turning you over and shaking you down. But now when they discover BTC is involved you get some extra trouble. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:13:58
Agreed! Pics of the farm and actual numbers to determine TCO please! The poster seems to be conflating making a profit via arbitrage of hardware with his solar mining rigs. They refuse to post numbers or sheets. It seems profit is based on hope of future value. 
Hey someday BTC is gonna be worth 1 million USD each, right? So that means my CPU minner is profitable!
