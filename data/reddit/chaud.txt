What advantage is there from investing in your fund vs [something like this](

Can you even use remote images in the CSS? I thought not, but I could be mistaken.

It is a joke to convert. Sell on mtgox, cash out through Dwolla, and have your money fairly quickly. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 02:18:53
I think you mean if, not when.

You can see the total number of shares in the current round on the site. It varies widely.

It's too bad they used MyBitcoin.
@_date: 2011-05-26 02:47:20
Someone bought (very roughly) 400k+ worth of btc which caused the original spikes.
@_date: 2011-05-11 14:30:54
It will give you that error when the user and pass is wrong as well.

Try Furmark and OCCT and other stressful things and see if they cause problems.

[MTRed]( has merged mining and PPS.

How do you see if overcoming the "chicken or the egg" problem and reaching any kind of useful critical mass ever?
@_date: 2011-07-06 00:50:45
So a pyramid scheme then.
@_date: 2011-05-22 04:45:34
No, subreddit custom CSS is limited in size and it would eventually become too much. 
@_date: 2011-05-27 11:49:54
Someone filling all of the sell orders up to that price all at once drove the price up.
@_date: 2011-05-18 20:50:08
Some pools are are free, some take fees (MTRed doesn't). Some are big, some are small, pools that are giant get more consistent payouts, smaller pools get more varied time between payouts. Both should be roughly equal over time.
@_date: 2011-06-03 15:14:35
Can we not post this several times a day. Everyone is able to go and look if they care about the price.

The username and password is per worker, not your site login.

They got hacked and MTRed hasn't so far!

-f 900 and up your voltage slightly, keep the card around 70c with manual fan control if necessary.

There were a few server hiccups and people are tired of this awfully long round.

Check back in a year.

What you really need right now is code to allow people to pay the current USD equivalent in bitcoins for goods and services and converts it back to USD instantly for the company. No sane company will want to hold on to bitcoins for any amount of time right now. Something easy to integrated for smaller companies that would let them accept bitcoins with little risk.
@_date: 2011-09-11 04:35:36


This seems very very unlikely. However, it is people like you keeping the system alive, so good on you!
@_date: 2011-05-20 04:30:13
If only reddit had a small pool in the sidebar that needed miners.
@_date: 2011-09-11 02:26:03
I would venture the guess that almost everyone involved with bitcoin just wants to make some money. The amount of actual trade is almost nothing because of the volatility. Add to that the fact that the USD is just fine for almost everyone and I can't see bitcoin taking off in any major way, ever. 
@_date: 2011-07-05 16:59:15
[GUIMiner]( finally has backup pool support.
@_date: 2011-09-11 02:48:59
I made some money off of it myself, that was the only thing that really interested me. Time enjoyed isn't wasted!
@_date: 2011-09-11 03:55:20
What do you think about  ?
@_date: 2011-07-08 04:36:57
Nope, someone came into the MTRed IRC channel with a keygen infected with a miner maybe a month ago and I am sure people had botnets mining before that.
@_date: 2011-05-12 05:03:55
@_date: 2011-09-11 04:07:23
Fair enough, but bitcoins are something that anyone who wants to make money will exchange for dollars, not so much the other way around. 
@_date: 2011-05-25 00:54:35
2 more days until it is 1.7x of what it is now! I hope all of the people who bought giant setups break even before the bubble pops.
@_date: 2011-05-18 20:47:44
As far as I know they work fine, I have been paid after block confirmations are done. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:08:55
There is already some malware attached to keygens that does this, pool hopping, and namecoin mining. It even uses mtred, deepbit, btcguild, btcmine, but not slush for some reason.
