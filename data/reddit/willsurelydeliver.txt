It's not the protocol, it's the wallet's implementation. 
If I am not mistaken the official client now preallocates 100 unused address and uses them whenever a clean one is needed, so you would need to do 100 transactions since your last backup to start using non backed up addresses.

No, you can mine whenever and however much you want. 
But these days the reward you can expect with a regular computer is very low, so don't expect much.

hah, blockchain.info isn't at the top of its game but blockexplorer found it: 
The private key would be much more difficult because large part of the data is missing so the error correction code should be used. The public key was easier because the right part of the code is unharmed.  I am not familiar with the encoding so won't start working on that now, but I am sure that a lot could be recovered. Both codes are generated using the most error-tolerating settings of the QR specs. And if only 30-40 bits are missing, that can be brute-forced knowing the public key.
Also the QR code is designed for any kind of binary data, but bitcoin addresses only use 58 characters, so "blindly" knowing that some characters are not possible probably also helps recovering with the help of the error correction codes.
btw, the QR code specification is a mess so I used the code of bitaddress.org to learn about the location of the characters.
Maybe if you send the reward here, I will some day also come up with some educational challenge :)

No, it's a hard-coded feature, independent of the blockchain. They can share the key with someone they trust though.

Everyone has a bunch of public/private keypairs to sign messages. With these messages they can sign "transactions", where they spend what they already have.
- First problem: how do we now that they have money to spend? They must reference a previous transaction where they were being paid. They create a transaction where they say which is the previous transaction where they got the money they want to spend, and what is the public key of the person they want to send it to, and then sign the entire thing with their of private key. The public key belonging to this private key must have been included in the previous transactions.
- Second problem: how do we know that the money from this previous transaction hasn't alrady been spent, and isn't this person reusing it again and again? For this we need a verifiable way to check whether a transaction has already been spent. Every ~10 minutes the transactions are collected into a so called "block", and these block are disemminated on the network. Having all these blocks, it's possible to check that they don't contain an earlier transaction spending the money that the payer is claiming to have.
- Third problem: How do we make sure that these "blocks" are not tempered with? All blocks have to reference the (hash of the) previous block, creating a chain: hence the name "blockchain". This blockchain is practically the database (or ledger) of all the transactions ever done. (there are some theoretical ways to get rid of the old, not anymore needed parts) So having a single block, you can check whether the earlier blocks are valid or not: if the hashes check out, the chain is valid.
- Fourth problem: How to prevent that someone replaces the last few blocks with some alternate blocks to change the recorded transactions (for their own interest, or due to some problems in network communication) and then convince the network that he has the right blockchain? Make the creating of blocks hard. Very hard. So hard that on average only a single node can be created every 10 minutes by the entire network. Require the block to have an extremely unlikely hash collision. This hash collision must be found and included in a block, otherwise the network won't accept it. The hash collision means that the hash of the block must be smaller than a given number.
- Fifth problem: How do determine the needed hash collision, when the network's size is constantly changing? A number called "difficulty" is introduced, and the required hash collision is that the hash of the block must be smaller than this number. (so in fact the smaller this number is, the more difficult to create a block) This difficulty number is readjusted approx once every two weeks, to make sure that the nodes of the network are only capable of finding one block approx once every 10 minutes.
- Sixth problem: Where does the money come from? If all transactions must refer to an earlier transaction, which one is the first? Solution: everyone who finds a block, gets a "bianco" transaction where money is "made from nothing". The probability of getting such a reward is proportional to the effort spent on finding the hash collision. This is called mining: new money is introduced for effort spent.
I assume that by "varying hashcash function" you meant the adjusting of difficulty. Hashcash is usually used as synonym of proof-of-work systems, but the term isn't really used in the bitcoin community.
The "initial number of zeros" is the "non-mathematical" way of saying that "hash(block+salt) &lt; Ndifficuly" must be true,
where Ndifficulty is a 256-bit number, and mining means trying to change "salt" until we manage this. And difficulty is readjusted based on the time it took to find the last 6 * 24 * 14 (two weeks worth of) blocks: if it took only one week, difficulty should double. (the target number should be halved)

I've seen it on a lot of places and if you read their topics on bitcointalk or their own forum they are heavily working on pushing it everywhere. On sites discussing alt-coins they got quite a lot of publicity.


And none of those improvements has ever been disclosed in more than a few words. Closed source + vague promises without technical details = not much confidence in it.
Also the client is a bunch of crap, it keeps crashing and throwing errors.

You have absolutely no assurance that they won't just take your money or run. Even if the people behind the companies reveal their identities, it may turn out that those are just carefully constructed fake identities, if they had been planning it from the start.
So be careful. It may be possible to find good investments, but the risks are huge, and scams are everywhere. (this not only goes for mining companies, but all kind of business shares)
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:14:47
I don't think it's just the lack of servers. I believe their infrastructure is completely misengineered, there is no reason for a trading engine to lag this badly at this transaction amounts.
A properly coded trading engine could handle this real-time with absolutely no problems, and from there it's only a matter of adding a few proxies/web-frontends to handle the user-facing connections.
This would be acceptable for a small shop, but not for a business with such revenues. I would gladly rewrite their engine for one week of their revenue :D

Then the file isn't referenced anymore in the file system's "table of content", but the data itself may still exist somewhere in some blocks. (probably does, unless a new file was saved to that exact location) 
As a last resort you could try and brute force all locations in the filesystem to see whether it contains (in MultiBit wallet's format) a private key giving 1Bndi... as public key.

Have you even sent any money to this wallet? The beginning of the public key seems to be 1KQJsq, (those characters are visible on the public QR code) but according to blockchain.info there isn't any address with such firstbits in the blockchain. 
Or I messed up the decoding.

Perhaps for some features, but the protocol is mostly written in stone, and can not be changed. All the proposed new features are just awkward hacks on top of the blockchain, a fundamental change would lead to a fork. (actually even quite simple ones can lead to that as we have seen earlier this week)

Could we stop calling the site "blockchain" and use its full name instead? It was confusing even for me when I first saw it, and I am pretty sure it messes with the mind of the new bitcoiners even more. What we call blockchain has never been offline.

Whoever controls the 1K3...LoCG address also controls this one:   
(it's also an input in the transaction spending the 1K3...LoCG amount)
You may be able to get some info on that address by contacting  someone who got money from that address. There is for example an address (15yw...) tied to a bitcointalk forum account (who was active today), you may ask that guy about that transaction.

The QR code contains the private key encrypted with a password. The encryption algorithm is deliberately designed to be slow: even if you know the right password, a computer will have to work a lot with the decryption. This makes it infeasible to try billions of passwords.
The standard also gives an option to create encrypted private keys without knowing the actual password: you keep your password, send some magic numbers to someone else, and that person will be able to create encrypted addresses for you. (and put them on physical coins, or print paper wallets for you, etc.) But that person won't be able to spend money from those addresses, only you.

Aren't you supposed to use their own messaging system for all communication? Then if the bitcoin address is exchanged there, they could check whether the transaction took place and part with seller or buyer accordingly. 
This of course requires them actively supporting the sale of bitcoins, so I wouldn't hold my breath yet....
