Don't have time for that, like I said they get frequently listed here on this sub, but they all more or less lead to me losing my entire investment which all things considered is a risk I'm willing to take. None of the cons seem to me as fundamentally fatal ones that can't be overcome, otherwise I wouldn't be here.

It's not just the end of the year, people have been saying for many months "why should I invest in something that has dropped x% in value since last month".

"No real company would accept fairy dust as payment" is what a troll responded to me just a few days ago in response to greenmangaming.com adding bitcoin to its payment options.

Nobody ever donates anything without some sort of a catch. I want to send Mozilla some bitcoin in exchange of making bitcoin marginally more accepted, but that won't happen if Mozilla is too ashamed to tell the world that they're accepting it.

Appreciate the warning but frankly anyone still falling for such an obvious phishing attempt is destined to lose his money sooner than later. No, nobody actually sent you $1000+ by accident.
  
I'm glad to see it's at least 0.001 BTC. A few of these and I can get myself a free cup of coffee.

Just to make sure, was your password something gibberish and nothing found in the dictionary, or if you use pass phrases (16 letters in kinda short for that) it's not a sentence that makes sense, or perhaps a line from a book or movie?

This is why bitcoin can't be stopped. The more countries and banks think about banning bitcoin, the more incentive others have to accept it.
@_date: 2014-12-13 10:41:08
Top post details a lot of good reasons. What it doesn't mention is that every time you buy something with a credit card, the bank is going to take a cut of the sale. With bitcoin, your money goes directly to the receiver without any middle men taking their cuts, apart from a meager transaction fee that is less than one cent regardless of purchase.
  
Why should you care if Microsoft saves money by eliminating credit card fees? Because if enough people buy with bitcoin, *theoretically* Microsoft can sell games for cheaper. Some stores already give discounts to bitcoin users, passing their savings directly to the customer.

This is a good conversation to have from time to time.
  
I ignore most of the criticism because there's nothing new in it. When I invested in bitcoin a while ago, I carefully evaluated all the pros and cons of the currency. I have no allegiance towards it other than believing that it can work.
  
I'll gladly read any new criticisms anyone might have, and if it can convince me then I'll certainly sell all I've got. But every time it's the same "ponzi scheme" or "tulip mania" arguments as if it's supposed to be some grand revelation and something that had never occurred to me before. It's condescending.
  
Following your CEO example, imagine if every few weeks somebody had called Steve Jobs and told him "don't you realize people will never buy your computers over Windows?". Do you think that he himself hadn't ever thought about their strengths and weaknesses? And how long do you think it would take for him to bet bored of the casual know-it-alls offering their "valuable information"?
@_date: 2014-12-06 15:45:05
Most obvious question is have you told anyone that you hold a large number of bitcoin? Any friends? Any online post that can be linked to you personally?
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:39:21
For a lot of things, visuals are an important part of the experience. But for managing your money, I'd say that a "boring" look is pretty much the only thing to go about it. This is one place where you really don't want to risk anything on behalf of good looks.
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:31:36
I'm very excited. I think people are (rightfully) more wary of going into a buying frenzy so we won't see those crazy +$100 in a day for a week movements any more. But there hasn't been any scandals lately, instead just a steady flow of good news. I definitely expect this to translate into the price sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:50:07
Charlie is guilty and deserves punishment. The magnitude of the punishment can be argued, 2 years is a long time but then again the US justice system is known to put people away for life for smoking weed, so in that sense I guess it could have been a lot worse.
  
This of course doesn't explain how so many corrupt bankers are not only walking fee, but actually being rewarded for breaking the law. But that's a separate discussion. Looking at bitcoin, for the legitimacy of the currency it's very important that bitcoin entrepreneurs follow the law, regardless of if they agree with it or not. In the eyes of the general public, we can't have convicted criminals running the show.
@_date: 2014-11-23 05:24:38
Top post in this thread deals with most of them. If you're interested in bitcoin I suggest you write a list of your own and go over each item by yourself rather than listening to any person on the Internet.

His emails are clear proof that he knew he was breaking the law and yet he did it anyway because it was profitable for him. Did he harm anyone? Well that depends on whether you think money laundering is a victimless crime or not. I don't. Money laundering allows violent criminals, arms dealers, dictators and other very bad people to go about their business.

They said in their blogpost that bitcoin for other countries was coming. Disappointed to see that it still hasn't because I'd love to show them some support!
@_date: 2014-12-31 12:54:38
People can look at pretty much any statistic and withdraw from that the evidence they need to make the conclusion they want.
  
But other than that, people have a natural tendency to look for patterns everywhere even when there aren't any, and they can typically only see the (very) short term. Therefore I'm not too surprised to see so many posts like "bitcoin has dropped since last month, why would anyone invest in a currency like that". They apparently haven't heard of Warren Buffett's advice to buy when others are selling, and to sell when others are buying.
@_date: 2014-12-09 07:18:48
Uhh, I'm actually not sure. I thought it was in response to the guy who lost his bitcoins because of a bug in their code.
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:22:55
No, I just don't care to waste any more of my time on Internet trolls on debates where there aren't any winners.
  
It's my money and if you think I'm going to throw tens of thousands of dollars on something just for the lulz and not bother to do any research, then, you go ahead and think whatever you want.
  
Should you wish to convince me otherwise, please tell me a fatal protocol flaw that I've missed. I'll give you a thousand dollar reward if you can actually tell me something that'll save my investment from a terrible mistake.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:41:37
Sorry but this sounds like a whole lot of bullshit, more lies to cover up previous lies. You don't think people would have noticed otherwise? You don't think you could have just told people if you wanted them to notice? You did not realize that trying to change history would look *extremely bad* on your part?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:49:56
He would have no motivation to crash the price though. He'd make more money if he sold them in tiny batches over a long period of time, and raise less eyebrows. Of course if he's greedy, he might.
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:39:57
Aren't you're overreacting a bit? Let's wait for the official announcement before we declare this thing a Gox 2.0. I'm betting that no one has lost anything, and if they have then it's only for new deposits so the losses can't be big Bitstamp should be able cover the losses.
  
Mistakes happen in code. The question is how quickly are they noticed and whether losses will be compensated. There was a problem with Blockchain recently and they handled both issues admirably.
@_date: 2015-01-06 04:24:48
If you aren't completely computer illiterate then learning about best bitcoin practices is probably faster than going to a bank to open an account.
  
And if you intend to invest large amounts of money, in the amounts of many thousands of dollars, then hopefully spending one afternoon on reading about bitcoin security isn't "too long didn't read".
  
edit: And if you just want to play around with a few tens of dollars worth then you likely don't need maximum security as long as you don't do anything too stupid, like access it on a virus-infested computer or store it online unencrypted.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:36:00
I agree but at least when bitcoin was still going up in value, I saw way too many posts of people trying to get casuals into bitcoin by promising tenfold, even hundredfold returns. It is no wonder if people labelled it as a ponzi scheme upon first impression as they've been correctly taught that anything that seems too good to be true probably is.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:38:28
You or Satoshi or anyone else hasn't lost anything until they've sold. Why is this so hard to understand? Satoshi has exactly the same amount of bitcoins he had the day before, therefore what has he lost?
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:30:25
Now that we've solved this... Why is rescanning necessary? Should I go rescan all my wallets just in case there's some coins lost in there that I haven't noticed were missing?

I think that's a bit prejudiced anyway. Slovenia is a fairly advanced country and I don't see any reason NOT to trust them. If it were Russia or Nigeria then I would feel different.

Every time somebody stops mining, it will increase profitability for those still mining. Therefore there will never be a situation where everyone stops mining. If enough companies stop mining, I'll start doing it myself.
  
Assuming centralization near 51% won't happen, then "this is actually good news" as we say around here. Increased profitability for miners will mean that they can keep more bitcoins to themselves instead of being forced to sell to cover costs, thus decreasing downwards pressure on the price.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:35:19
What? Please do explain, I'm sure many people want to hear this.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:51:23
Bitcoin dropping in value has become a self-fulfilling prophecy (the same but opposite thing that caused the insane price hike in 2013). The price is dropping because people think that the price is dropping. It will stop either when weak-minded people realize that they don't have to sell just because everyone else is selling, or when these weak hands are all out of coins.

Bitcoin had a terrific year in 2014 in all aspects except for the price. If you thought bitcoin was a good idea a year ago, then your conviction should only be much stronger now.
  
That's why I'm holding. I'm not going to say that price doesn't matter, but the price isn't all there is to it. Keep soldiering on and eventually all these good news will translate into the price.

Switching the licensing can easily be attributed to an error in judgment and quickly forgiven with an apology. However trying to fake your history and hoping nobody notices is much more serious than that. It is a clear-cut display of dishonesty and as such it's very difficult to trust anything these guys do or say from now on.

What a terrible way to fuck up a great product.

In SE Asia, many bars and restaurants and even some guest houses either don't accept credit cards at all, or they add a 3% fee on top of your bill. Can't really blame them, everything is already so cheap that the profit margins must be really low even without credit card fees.
@_date: 2015-01-31 05:12:25
You are still not giving a better alternative for the story. If that is not the case, please explain your decision in detail. To me it certainly appears that you really were that stupid, as no other explanation has been provided. If you simply wanted people to notice, this was by far the worst way to do that. **You could have just told us.**
  
It seems to me that you've done an incredibly stupid thing, and are trying to cover it up by saying "come on, we wouldn't do that" and hoping that nobody calls your bluff.

In addition to what others have said, they perhaps recognize a real innovation and understand that if they want to stay ahead of others they can't curb innovation just to protect what they have now.
  
Imagine if they had banned the use of Internet just to protect the US post industry.

To assume that the year of 2015 will be identical to 2011 is crazy.

You did it because it made you feel better about yourself. Perhaps you also told others about it in an effort to make you look better.
  
It's okay to be selfish, and the recipient doesn't really care what your motivations are. It's a win-win. This is why Mozilla trying to hide bitcoin donations seem very counter-productive. They want bitcoin but they don't want anyone to know that they took it.

This is a perfect opportunity for you to explain more about your decision that many people find very confusing. Instead you just said "we meant to do that" and offered no explanation beyond that.

According to everything we know about the situation, unless you have sent bitcoin to Bitstamp just now, your money hasn't been stolen.

I can't open a bank account because I don't have an address. I have enough money that I can travel the world, and for the past year I've just been staying at hotels and hostels in cheap countries, and occasionally at a friends place.
  
I do still have my previous bank account that's registered to the last address that I lived in that I can use. But I don't have any communications with that bank, and if they ever decide to investigate they'd easily conclude that my details aren't correct and likely would shut me down. Any physical mail they send me won't be read by me, but by somebody who now lives in that address who could probably steal my identity if he wanted to. If I want to do any changes to my bank account I have to physically fly there to do so in person. If I lost my credit card I imagine there would be no way for me to get a new one as they'd just send it to the address where I haven't lived in a year.
  
It's just a pain in the ass overall and a great example of how simple things have been made complicated because banks haven't adopted new radical ideas like the Internet. Why can't we communicate via email? I sent them a simple question from the other side of the world and they simply said that they can't discuss that unless I go to their office in person (I get that there's an identity theft concern and they're trying to protect me, but there ought to be several ways I could prove my identity over the Internet).

If I use Blockchain.info to see which IP first relayed my transaction, it has never been even close to my real location. Seems to me that at best they know which continent the transaction originated. My ISP knows that I'm connected to the bitcoin network, but I really doubt that they can see what transactions I have made.
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:59:37


  
A bit hyperbole, don't you think? Anyone who bought bitcoins 2 weeks ago and wants to spend today are already winning.

I'm not an American and I'm not rich. I'm staying at cheap countries where it's actually cheaper for me to stay in a hotel than pay rent and utilities in my native country. So no, I can't afford to pay for a shitbox of an apartment for a year just so that I could have an address to my name. That would increase my living expenses by something like 33% per month.
  
I get that very few people are in a similar situation than me, most people who don't have bank accounts are so because they can't afford them. I'm just pointing out that it's not just affecting poor 3rd world countries people.
  
The Internet is more than 20 years old by now. It's getting harder and harder to accept "infancy" excuses for companies and governments who are just too stupid or lazy to adapt.

You do understand that my comment reflects my own opinion, not the entire sub? And not everybody who uses bitcoin is a libertarian neckbeard? I don't have a problem with regulations and I actually prefer it over complete anarchy.
  
I'd rather they not ask that many questions, but the most important thing here is that the company works legally, otherwise exchanges would be coming and going every few months and there would be no reliable way to exchange coins at all. We can and should change the laws long-term, or we could set up exchanges in countries where the law isn't so strict. But in the meantime, Bitstamp is good enough.

I agree. Unless you know these people personally to be tech-enthusiast, they're probably not interested in the tech-babble, won't be able to understand it, and conclude that it's too difficult for them.
  
If somebody asks you how does bitcoin work, the best answer is "it's like email, you enter a recipient and then type your password and click 'send'". If they're not satisfied with that answer then you can go deeper into the specifics.

I imagine that most people who pay for porn are tech-illiterate middle-aged men who know only to go to porn.com and enter their credit card number.
  
People who know how to use bitcoin probably know how to download a porn torrent so they're not really the target audience for the porn industry.

Why not both?
@_date: 2015-02-25 13:31:01
Yeah but that's also my point. They'd rather have one clueless but well-paid guy paying $50 a month on his credit card rather than having several bitcoin users who drop a few dollars every now and then.
  
Maybe there is some niche demand but the traditional porn industry isn't interested in it. They want to be where the big bucks are.

I had never heard of Bter.com. Why did people use a lesser known exchange over well established ones like Bitstamp, Kraken or I guess Coinbase in the US?
  
Seems to me that a lesser known exchange is always riskier than well-known ones. I know Bitstamp was hacked as well but they caught it quickly and reimbursed everyone affected.
