Yes but you eventually have to sell it off.  What's the point if it is put in savings for ever? Eventually it must be sold otherwise you have 0 net gain. If you want to collect interest on the Bitcoin, that will be taxed. Either way, you will be paying tax on that

Fuck I hate this group.  Even though this video is pro encryption, their journalism is bad and constantly make mistakes on known facts. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:15:43
...what? So you would rather spite out the government and bankers than actually use the currency for the purpose it was made for?
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:02:17
But it still is a payment system. If you want wide adoption, you need people to be able to trade it.  Otherwise, it's just cool digits on a screen. 
Since there will trade, taxes will be involved.
You sound like a hardcore traditionalist, things change, society changes

Of course? It’s the best method for importing drugs and never getting caught. Australian Law Enforcement have 0 chance of identifying him and it’s all down to police at the other end.
I have been doing this shit for ages and have never lost a package.

Lmao. You’re a fucking 15 year old virgin. Get your head out of your ass.

The hypocrisy in your comment is unfathomable. Firstly, I’m not even America, I live in Australia with strict gun and drug laws.
You are saying that even though child porn is trafficked through crypto, you don’t want it to infringe on your liberty. Yet, you want to effect other people’s liberty for stricter gun laws? 
And gun laws don’t matter in this context, you’re doing so illegally anyway. Crypto just makes everything so much easier to buy. As I have previously said in this comment thread, I have bought drugs for years and never had a hiccup. 
Someone that I know buys through the same supplier and sells it on. He just gets it sent to an anonymous post box and there is 0 connection to him. The only way they catch him is him selling it on through cash. He has 0 chance of being caught through the process from his supplier to him.

It's called fraud forensics, there are literally computers monitoring transaction patterns on criminal's accounts and seeing where it goes. This is common knowledge.
I don't even like Obama, nor am I american. I am just unbiased enough to know when someone makes a good point about fiat, I don't act turn into a sheep like yourself.

It actually is. Talking to any LE's and they will say it's easier to catch crims with cash. I have been buying drugs off the same supplier for years and have never had any hiccups. It's just shit like weed and MD, but it could be actual deadly shit like heroin, passports etc. 
Once you know the owner of the key, it's hook, line and sinker. If you never find out, it's impossible. With fiat, you at least have openings. LE's catch crims all the time through monitoring banks and banks themselves monitor for fraudulent behaviour

He has a point though. It is easier than ever to buy drugs, child pornography, weapons etc with darknet markets. Before governments could track suspicious money transfers, but now they can't. I can literally go on the web right now and buy weapons and heroin with a good guarantee without being caught. Before governments could block transfers, subpoena banks and their clients details etc

You're not technically wrong, but the way you phrased "backed by oil" people can perceive as wrong.  USD is pegged to oil, so if oil goes up, USD goes up.  If it's backed, it means you can go to the government or banks and trade in your USD for oil as they are considered "the same." 
Basically it's different back in the old days when USD was actually hacked by gold. It's different than that with oil

Except we know what happens when there's deflation. Your currency needs inflation otherwise your economy crashes

How long does it take to be dropped and then what happens?
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:37:48
Ok, hopefully it will be confirmed when I wake up. I am in dying need of money atm and I don't want a tragic case of BTC crashing in a day and not being able to eat

An alternative where you can destroy the coin and not care about it plummeting is if the corrupt orgs/individuals have invested interests in other coins.
I haven't fully thought out the logistics yet, but in the future if crypto is more prevalent, you could think of a scenario where a competing coin(s), bribe or influence miners to rally and control 51%, destabilising it.  The price of the coin drops and being invested in other coins make you money.  Completely hypothetical and probably has it flaws, but a possibility.

Indirectly. On average, the bottom 10% of the wealth distribution are richer than 20 years ago despite the top 10% getting richer.
It's the neoliberalism effect. In another 10 years time, the bottom 10% will have more available services because of how cheap they become
