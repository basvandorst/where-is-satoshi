We need a HoneyBadger coin.
Oh wait, BTC is that.

remindme! 1000 years
I want to see if this thing actually reminds me in 1000 years. Tell my descendents. :)

Going to buy back in, waiting for a &lt;4300 price
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:01:01
I am ready to believe you.... for 1000 bux, I'll be your biggest cheerleader :) :) :)
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:34:06
No thanks. I'll HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:44:53
Ok, so I said WTH. Why not. I registered.
Not only no BTC, not even a confirmation email to set up.
Email harvest much?

I wish the Reminder bot could remind on price and not date. LOL
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:21:37
SO MUCH WIN

Not seeing where to do deposit/withdrawal option selection.

If you have no pants to wear, law enforcement will give you both a place to stay, and food to eat.
Just sayin....

Uh...  (rolls 2 10-sided dice) ... I successfully disbelieve.

My only regret is not understanding in early 2010.
I'd be a trillionaire. :)
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:38:50
You are wise. I shall not beat myself up.
However, I like to fantasize about putting 2000 into BTC in early 2010. :) :) :)
It's the same fantasy I have when I imagine winning MegaMillions Lotto. :) :) :)

Wake up.
It's already there.
RemindMe! 1 second "See?"
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:57:29
Ok, finally got the email, logged in and filled in personal info. Next steps?
You can look at me as your public 'test case'. :)
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:06:14
Point taken.
