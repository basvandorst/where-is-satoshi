I do. If the current state is not profitable/efficient for your company as a payment method, then you should collect the gains you’ve been making for years and move on to the more suitable alternative. That’s what I’d do, i wouldn’t be hanging out here telling people how worthless bitcoin is and how it should become bcash 2.0 or be doomed to fail its primary purpose

Buying and holding = Investing in a technology which is in its development phase. There are plenty already existing solutions to microtransactions with low to zero fees at this moment, and your fiat and debit card are the cheapest options. Are you really in deaperate need of a world-changing technological innovation to solve a non-existing problem? Bitcoin’s primary purpose was and still is to change the whole system, it’s a revolution which needs to be planned, developed and implemented with care and technical knowledge. Those who can’t see the bigger picture beyond the primitive, shouldn’t be here.

Being critical is when you make an effort to dive into the matter, investigate the history and the tech, its when you do an extensive research, check your sources, then double check to make sure there is no conflict of interest and people you interview don’t have a hidden agenda; yoy hear out different opinions, and you cover the full story. This is not being critical, this is speading disinformation, it’s slander/libel. If bitcoin was a brand/company, all of these contributors, including the news paper would get suied for defamation.

No thank god its not. But the defamation laws do apply to all legal entities, which can be human or non-human (businesses/corporations/firms/agencies etc). I do worry though, cause I think the only thing that can harm this great project is the mass hysteria, not the ‘slow’ development
