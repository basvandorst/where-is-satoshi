Your entire diagram assumes the lender is somehow able to have a USD balance without counterparty risk. That is the impossible claim here. There would need to be an exchange balance to hold the dollar balance. If you assume that then sure, it's possible. But that's not possible without counterparty risk. 


Realistically the only way to do a trust minimal CFD is with a Bitcoin multisig. You deposit 1 Bitcoin into Abra. Convert it to $100 by locking in a multisig with me. I take the other side of the bet with 1BTC. Price drops 50% and you want to withdraw $100 in Bitcoin. You need 2BTC, I lose everything.
If you wanted some multisig contract that synthetically represented USD, you would need another derivative bet going on in some fantastical way.

Think about how a CFD works. You have someone betting long, and another short. In the case of Abra, the customer pegging their value needs to be covered for a short position. If the price of Bitcoin goes down, they need more Bitcoin to cover their pegged value. If it goes up, they need less. The long term holder (Abra Lender) gets more Bitcoin if the price goes up, and they lose Bitcoin if the price goes down.
If a long term holder never entered a CFD their Bitcoin balance is only exposed to USD fluctuations, the amount of Bitcoin they hold would never change. Entering a CFD doubles down the long bet, when you win, you win more, but when you lose, you lose more (both loss in USD value and in Bitcoin holdings). 
Abra says that the lender cannot lose any Bitcoin no matter what happens to the price, and they make interest! This doesn't make sense. **Ask yourself: where does the extra Bitcoin come from to cover the customer in the case of a Bitcoin drop in value? Out of thin air?** He also claims also there is no counteryparty risk which inherently means a multisig, if there is an exchange involved there is counterparty risk. Listen to the podcast again closely.

If they actually do this they will need a nobel prize and this is just about the least interesting use case for it. They will change finance forever. It certainly would seem possible to create a derivative multisig contract that acts as synthetic USD on the blockchain, but to do so in a way that does not risk anyone losing money seems ridiculous.

Of course man, try and sign up for Abra and derive a key associated with your account from the backup mnemonic. You won't have any luck.

Yea, no accountability! 
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:00:18
I have tried repeatedly do use the 13 word BIP 39 mnemonic to generate the keys associated with the account, whatever derivation scheme they use is non standard, or in fact it is not associated with the keys on the account and is just some special Abra recovery seed. Once you deposit the funds the key associated with your deposit gets swept into another address with more Bitcoin (3 outputs, one with your deposit, another with an amount slightly above your deposit amount and then a larger output - the latter two outputs are associated with the same p2pkh address) where it sits until you either withdraw the Bitcoin or change currencies. There is no way to actually get the keys as far as I can tell. They do not cycle deposit addresses either.

Abra is running what is very likely a scam. They claim that depositors can peg their USD value to "synthetically" derived fiat value without counterparty risk. They claim to do this by creating financial products on the blockchain, like CFDs. CFDs require a counterparty to bet against you. 
In the traditional case of a depositor moving their funds from Bitocin to pegged USD, the depositor in effect wants a short position covered (drop in price). They could enter into a multisig CFD with a long term holder who thinks the price will go up (they both lock up xBTC in a 2of2 multisig they mutually control). They lock the coin for some predetermined time, at which the price of Bitcoin is relayed to the two counterparties. If it goes down after contract expires the long term holder (who Abra calls lenders) has to give up Bitcoin to cover the depositors dollar position (denominated in Bitcoin). Vice versa being true for the depositor. 
This is fine and good, however Bill (the CEO of Abra) claims that their lenders are not exposed to any fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin, can make interest on that Bitcoin and have absolutely no counterparty risk (because it all happens on chain). Meaning they get their principle back at the end of the contract plus interest. Also, it is claimed the depositor can leave the contract at any time to get their funds--that's not how these sort of derivative products work (otherwise they would just be gamed). 
This is an extraordinary claim that if true, would be a breakthrough in our basic understanding of financial engineering/economics. We as a Bitcoin community should demand an explanation for this perpetual motion machine before Abra makes the entire community look bad.

I've already asked him to comment, he just keeps saying it's a secret and it will be released eventually. Does he have the competency to even assess Bill's claim? I don't know.*
Is it an implied scam or is it a malicious one? That is hard to say, the line is blurry. 
Without the peg Abra is just a fancy localbitcoins.

Does not say that anywhere. 
I implore you to come up with a scheme that allows traders to earn interest on their Bitcoin with 0 counterparty risk while doing CFDs on the blockchain. Remember, the Lenders cannot be in a direct CFD with the abra customer because that would expose them to loss of their Bitcoin holdings. The CEO literally says they are not exposed to Bitcoin losses at all (as in, they will always have the amount of Bitcoin they put in plus interest, no matter what). Also it has to let the Abra customer exit this magical CFD at any time to wd their funds.
The only way I can conceive of such a scheme requires liquidity on exchanges which certainly has counterparty risk. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:42:43
They claim they have a mechanism by which they can peg your Bitcoin to fiat using a CFD. They have long term Bitcoin holders taking the other side of the trade who never let go of their keys and who make interest on their Bitcoin (they are magically not exposed to drops in price when the Abra customer needs to wd more Bitcoin then they deposited), all with no counterparty risk. You can exit the CFD at _any time_ to get your Bitcoin back. CFDs have expiries, they can not just be left at any time, or you would leave any time you're "in the money." Supposedly this all happens on chain with multisig (like Reggie Middleton's Ultracoin).
This sounds like a perpetual motion machine.
If they actually did get this sort of thing right they would deserve a nobel prize for changing finance forever. Abra would certainly not be the most lucrative use case of this game changing perpetual motion machine.

I read that whole article and was hoping to see some useful technical criticism, but all I saw was whining. 
Miners are of course self interested, but if there interests get too far out of line with improving the technical foundations of the protocol then I am not sure how we are supposed to be sympathetic to that.

Abra claims that the trader is not exposed to price fluctuations in Bitcoin (except their own long position), they can earn interest with no counterparty risk AND the Abra customer can exit the CFD at any time. This is a perpetual motion scam. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:26:09
No you are very confused. The long term bitcoin holder (lender) on the abra side cannot be in a raw CFD with the Abra customer. That means they would lose Bitcoin if the price went down. Bill claims that the Lender is not in any way exposed to this and will earn interest on their Bitcoin simultaneously with no counterparty risk. Also, CFDs require an expiry, Abra says you can pull your money out at any time. This is a perpetual motion scam.

A block like this would not be strategic for a miner if he is attempting to maximize his profits (via fees). It would be useful to them perhaps only as an attack block in a selfish mining strategy, but thanks to work done on improving signature hashing algorithm this block would not take as long to validate as a BIP 101/109 3.7MB block.

There are two phases, the first is "dumb" routing rollout, the second phase is the routing blend with rendevous, beacons and onion. 
Rushing is not in the interest of the developers or community. Tempered, secure development will carry us the long haul, everyone needs to be patient (and/or contribute development resources).

You can do your best to go in and correct people, but new batches of shill accounts crop up and it becomes exhausting after awhile. Takes way more effort to correct falsehoods then to spread them.
Timeline for production use depends on what sort of production use you are considering. If you know your counterparty and want a direct channel open with them and don't need to be multi hop routed, then LN will be likely be in 'production' by Spring of next year (that's my guesstimate from following the work being done).
Major exchanges like Coinbase and Bitstamp could open channels between one another and lower the daily network volume by massive amounts. That would be a huge win for everyone. As for when LN will be implemented in popular mobile and desktop wallets, I am not sure. I know the Lightning Network company is working on a desktop app as we speak.

I enjoy BU, but and did a poor job of framing the economic model behind the fee market which supports conservative on chain scaling.
's main premise is that raising the block size will necessarily and predictably lower fees. He also argues that a fixed block size with limited excess block space is a change of economics. Both of these premises are false. As and many others have logically observed, the only way to guarantee low fees and quick confirmations is to unbound the block size. It is not only impossible to predict transaction volume at any given time, but if you do increase supply of block space and by proxy lower fees, businesses will build processes/models/services which will naturally consume this space and thus force constant block size increases post hoc.* And that's without even touching on the technical constraints to scaling a consensus critical, decentralized financial system.
As for the second false premise, it couldn't be more wrong. By nature of consensus rules, supply of block space is limited. Just because it's highly sought after does not mean the economic rule of limited supply changes. While the flip is naturally true: a promise to keep fees low and confirmations quick by effectively unbounding the block size (aka unlimiting the supply) is a significant change in economics. Edit-- this is why it's important to use measurable technical limits as the leading indicator for choices around scaling the network. Securing the network should always be priority, any change to consensus code must be self limiting in that context. 
*For example, when you look at the S.DICE business model the advantages of utilizing underpriced block space are significant. Based on the logic of the dice rolls, not only did S.Dice not need to store customer deposits for any longer than it took to calculate the outcome of the bet, but they also devised their provably fair gambling scheme in such a way that there was no need for the hot wallet to interact with the consumer facing website. This allowed them to offload their risk management and security costs onto the Bitcoin network. However, they created a massive amount of blockchain and UTXO bloat we will have to deal with forever. So, coupled with the low fees, quick confirmations and extra block space at the time, there is a good argument to be made that this type of business thrives under the "single on chain transaction / bet" customer interaction model.

There are some NOP codes which can only be enabled via hard fork. The segwit versioning scheme allows them to be enabled via soft fork. Because this makes rolling out script upgrades infinitely easier, it greatly increases the attractiveness of working on such improvements.

Try rereading my post Charlie. Testing the effects of segwit from a game theoretic and fee market perspective can take 6 months at least. Arguably more. Segwit2x locks in the changes at the same time... what if we discover some issues and it becomes clear 8MB is no longer safe? (e.g. orphan rates skyrocket)

The 95% threshold was there from the Gavin days. Your original complaint is that the fees are too high, so allowing for lower probability thresholds (which that PR does) means that you will get lower estimates. Core's default fees are high because the target confirmation is quite low (6 blocks, used to be 2) and there are a lot of people in the mempool paying high fees. When lots of other garbage exchanges and wallets are using high fixed fees out there it naturally screws up these shorter estimates.
Calling Alex a yeoman is pretty funny. Your original post was self contradictory, you claim users just want quick confirmations. Core gives estimates which have a very high likelihood of confirming in the short default target window. These are naturally going to be high because of the high threshold. Alex is now giving more options to the users who want more granular choices and you are complaining that its not what you want (when it 
is exactly what you are asking for).
If you think the Core fees are too high for now, raise your target. 
Here you go, look at the estimates coming through on non conservative mode right now:

Rootstock and Ethereum are useless for reasons you don't seem to understand. Exposing your "smart contract" to the public (and subsequently having all that code stored forever) is silly. Any meatspace-based aspect of the smart contract has no use living in code on the blockchain. The code can be executed off blockchain and then be used to move funds on the chain itself. Or a proof that the code was executed can be used to move funds.

You're still confused. Any financial product that requires information from outside the blockhcain is a meatspace contract. You can do these very easily on the Bitcoin blockchain using LN and other multisig scripts (e.g. 
Try and read my reply more closely. What I am telling you is that there is _no reason_ to execute the entire logic of the meatspace aspect of the contract on chain. In the case of a financial derivative, it is gathering the price and then moving the funds based on the outcome. When you have information from outside the chain coming in, there is no real context. Thus there is no reason to do all the logic on the chain. This is why ETH is nothing more than a parlor trick; says it best: blockchains are for validation, not abstract computation. 
Doing the logic on the chain is bad for privacy, bad for scale and just doesn't make sense from an engineering standpoint. But again, with special SNARKs I can prove any computation was done and then use that to execute a REAL smart contract, which is just the movement of funds on the blockchain.
