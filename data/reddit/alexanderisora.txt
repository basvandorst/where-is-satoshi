According to the CoinMarketCap data, there are 1,618,090,823 USDT in circulation. This number has been doubled since December 2017.
Bitfinex is baking as much USDT as they want. I have a 
bad feeling about their passion for printing empty money.

Hey there. Thanks for the valuable additions. I did not know that.
I'm gonna dig those deeper. You will help me (and the others) if you provide some links proving your words.

I'm so tired to see the new generation so-called crypto influencers, the HODL and To the moon idiots and join-any-two-points on a graph pump and dump YouTubers. 
The scene has become a toxic shithole (granted it wasn't a pristine land before), but at least most of the folks on my list have some credibility and or real past.

Why can banks decide what to buy or what not to buy? And why do people agree with such a dictatorship?!
This makes me mad.

We - creators of Bitcoin core, blockchain apps, media, wallets. 
And we - consumers of all those products who can influence creators and encourage them to pay more attention to the problem.


The founders of exchanges, wallets, apps should hire UX masters to improve their products.
We should fight scammers. Maybe create a Chrome Extension that alerts phishing sites. I've heard there is already a solution against the endless Slack 'myehtervvaIlet.com' spam. Great!
Next, the idea of giving to people a full responsibility about their money (private key) is dead by design because most humans are naive and irresponsible. Btw, I think the niche of the centralized accountants will be taken by huge corporations like MS, Google and Apple.
We also need more newbie guides. A lot more.  is good, but it's $10/m. No one will pay $10 to get knowledge he will probably not use.
