you pay capital gains on profits. 
if you make $100 and lose $500, you're now at a $400 loss. You don't pay capital gains taxes because there weren't any gains.

At this point no one knows. We are truly and undoubtedly in uncharted territory. There is no way of knowing where we're headed. I think I'm done waiting on crashes and corrections. The type of volume and interest that exists now compared to the ones of the past make me think there won't be a serious correction/crash like we envision. This shit is skyrocketing and I'm 100% fine with latching on and riding it all the way.

Oh believe me, I’m gonna ride the wave. Not gonna be some big baby and panic.
Will. Not. Panic.

Hey man, that guy said he sent me my bitcoin two weeks ago! It’s Coinbase’s fault that I haven’t received it!

I get what you’re saying. Think the car example is a bad one simply because it can be used for practical purposes, day in and day out for quite some time. 
But don’t worry, I’m in either way. Hodl-ing
