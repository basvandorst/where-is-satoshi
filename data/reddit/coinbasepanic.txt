Yes, amazingly my bank was more available than coinbase on a holiday weekend no less. 
I had an email out to them 12 minutes after I was notified, hopefully I will get some response today.

UPDATE, looks like it's moved.

To their credit, Coinbase DOES require 2 factor authentication for logins.
Not for purchases/withdrawals, as has been mentioned elsewhere in the thread.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:21:24
I did not have API access enabled at any point.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:24:25
I'm not sure what happens. Coinbase will be able to see what happened with the login event and figure out what went on.
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:34:09
It's possible that one of my computers have been compromised. Physically, I can't imagine anyone with access to my computer who even know what bitcoin is.
I'm thinking digitally compromised.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:30:28
That's not exciting to hear. Do you have any examples of something like this happening with Bitinstant?
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:33:41
I don't think it's rooted, but I'm not sure. The 2FA I was using was where coinbase texted me.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:09:15
Hopefully they will be able to access whatever records and data necessary to clear me of any suspicion.
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:36:56
I will go in and do that now. It's a bit frustrating this is happening at work, I only have so much time to work with.
And on a damn holiday no less.

I went in an unlinked the account, thanks for the advice. Having someone talk me through this is keeping me level headed.
I also called the bank and froze the accounts, I'll deal with coinbase directly to remit payment to them for legitimate purchases that hadn't posted.
If that's been compromised, who knows what else, I've got to go change all passwords and reformat.
Any other advice? Do you think I'll be held liable for this?
Also, I see the BTC has been transferred to another address, minus .0001 BTC.
What's the deal with that?
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:29:49
I wouldn't expect them to eat the loss, that would be a suicidal act of charity. Hopefully we can meet at a reasonable point for the both of us.
I would hope that going forward there'd be some sort of secondary confirmation when maxing the limit on an account, or other suspicious behaviors.
I'm AMAZED that there's no balance check when buying BTC. Amazon and even retail stores (via Telecheck or similar) verify before allowing purchases.
But then again, that's what we're trying to get away from with Bitcoin.
I'll update this post when I get more info from them.
You've been a huge help for me.

Interesting perspective. Not sure if a reddit thread would be of any use in a legal application though.
I hope coinbase is able to tell what happened.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:27:02
I was using the 2FA where I get a coinbase text. Not sure if that's different form Authy.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:14:47
That's interesting to hear. Please be careful and review your settings.
@_date: 2013-09-02 16:19:59
I emailed coinbase about this, also. No response yet.

So far, I'm waiting to hear from Coinbase. The opinion of a redditor in another thread is that the account was compromised either physically (unlikely as it's my wife and my kids, aged 1 and 3, who are at home), or digitally through a computer I used to access coinbase prior.
There was no login SMS, so it wasn't just a email/password issue.
I emailed coinbase, they have no phone # to call.
It's been about 4 hours now, I don't think they have anyone working emails today.
I'm watching the BTC hop from address to address on blockchain, contemplating how screwed I am.
Called the bank, froze my accounts.
Unlinked my account from Coinbase to prevent more transactions.
I had legitimate purchases from Coinbase for about $450 that hadn't posted over the weekend, I'll have to arrange with them a remittance. 
I have no clue how this will turn out, but I can't imagine it's going to make my life any easier.
I'm surprised there wasn't a check for acct balance before letting the BTC fly off to the internet. I made less than 20k last year, no way I have 6600 USD in my account.
Will keep you updated. Talking about it keeps me from freaking out too bad.

Who the thief is stealing from is yet to be determined. 
If this happened at my bank, they'd be stealing from the bank and I'd be protected.
If it was Amazon, I'd do fraud report for my CC# and I'd be protected.
I can (and have) frozen my bank account, and will be remitting payment for some coins I legitimately bought on Friday through other means when I can get a response from them.
It remains to be seen how coinbase will respond to this. The problem is that neither party has the goods (in this case, BTC). It's a lose-lose.
I will update this thread as it progresses unless requested by coinbase to do otherwise.
@_date: 2013-09-03 20:50:39
It was, I just wanted to make sure I was giving them credit at least for forcing 2FA on login.
No update yet.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:26:20
Is that relevant? No offense.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:25:40
1) That's the possibility I'm leaning towards now, because:
2) I had the text message 2FA set up, so I don't think I have access to anything that would generate a code.
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:06:35
Doesn't look like it unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-09-02 16:26:24
I just had an issue with coinbase less than an hour ago. 
I'm not sure what happened, but I regret linking my main bank acct# to the service. 
It seems there's no check for balance done when coins are purchased.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:14:14
While that would be useful, I think at that point it becomes an exercise of  how much work are we really going to make coinbase do, not to mention the potential blowback when a user decides the limits they set are inconveniencing them. 
Do you allow them to change the limit to get the BTC instantly? If so, then it's useless.
But an optional time limit would be quite a commitment on the user's end to day they'll never need instant BTC.

I have a google voice, but it' not tied to my cell # at all, I just send spam there. Would that be enough to be a problem?
