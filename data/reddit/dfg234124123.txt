BCC doesn't have segwit and afaik currently has no alternative fix for transaction malleability.
Given that the next important phase of cryptocurrencies is likely to be the build out of the lightning network it's at a significant disadvantage.
I think the project is kindof a false flag to split the community and possibly the hash power to make sure that segwit2x fails.. or even if that isn't the intent, it will have this effect.
If say half the bitcoin hash power joins BCC after aug 1st, then it gives some time for the difficulty to readjust so when bitcoin fragments with segwit2x forking off it shouldn't harm the original bitcoin too much and might ensure that bitcoin retains the highest hash rate and the longest chain.
With the competition now split between two alternatives it makes them both less threatening.

Just thinking.. as the price gets high enough that people will give up on buying a whole BTC, it actually might help people psychologically allow the price to go much much higher.

worth it to avoid giving the banks 2.5%

There's also zyado.com and bitstamp.net and of course the ever reliable btc-e.com oh and itbit.com and gatecoin.com

open an account with  and transfer the funds via there.. while you're at it, open an account with  and  so you can also get funds back out again efficiently too.

apparently existing spv clients may join segwit2x if it has a longer chain.. this could be problematic.. and wouldn't work well/reliably since most nodes they connect too won't be segwit2x nodes but it could lead to confusion.

so everyone locks their BTC inside ViaBTC until Aug 1st - then they sell off your BTC and trigger a momentary price collapse by withdrawing support for segwit .. then they rebuy everyone's BTC in time for Aug 1st.

seems quite unlikely imo

sure, but by then the appetite for BCC may not exist

this is great.. the more hard forks there are the less legitimacy any of them will have.. so less threat to original bitcoin.

best option is probably kraken.com or bitstamp.net.. you can also open a fidorbank.uk account to send the funds inexpensively (they have good fx rates and £2.49 to send a SEPA transfer). Another option is to use fire.com  or bunq.com in conjunction with an fx service such as transferwise.com (forward money to fire EUR account via transferwise and then send to kraken/bitstamp).

are they allowed to use the $10K to shut down the company, re-open under a new name and reapply for the $10K or start accepting cash one more?
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:38:49
almost certainly none.. you'll probably have to consider what's most important and make some concessions.

probably because they're really easy to buy at any convenience store for cash with no id.. so lots of demand to pay that way.. and on the other hand they're risky since people can also buy them with stolen CC and charge back.. so sellers need to charge a high premium in order to not lose out to fraud and people are still willing to pay because it's so convenient.

Only do it if you're planning to run a node long term.. running it for 2 weeks is a waste of time. It could still be useful to block sybil attacks from segwit2x after the 90 day HF.
