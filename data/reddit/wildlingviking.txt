You should do some research before you get on here and ask such an obtuse question.

Wait, so trump can run around and do god knows what illegal activity and not pay taxes for 20 years. And just to see his returns the case is gonna have to go to the Supreme Court? But us? We have to open our laptops and phones, invite the officer into our home or business and let them look at whatever they want? And then if we don’t show up for deposition we are in contempt of court and will be thrown in jail. Seems totally fair.

So this is what the email from Coinbase was about. That site is the worst. The future MySpace of crypto.

Coinbase pro raised their fees last week. It was the last straw for me. I’m done with those greedy punks

Please stay OUT of bitcoin. The last thing we need is politicians getting involved. They fuck up anything they touch.

Where can you buy and sell bitcoin without paying such ridiculous fees at coinbase? i'm on their coinbase pro website and just do market buys and sells. I tried to set up a limit sell the other day at 10,005 and apparently that didn't work because i woke up this morning and still owned it at 9850. I'm so sick of giving this website cash hand over fist....is there any legit alternatives to what im doing??

The “absurd and outrageous,” label is trademarked by coinbase and their ridiculous fees.
