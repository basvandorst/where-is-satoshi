Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark just said this past week that lightning is NOT ready for mainnet. It is under development still and it is reckless to use on mainnet. Keep it on test net.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:10:54
It is multiplying a constant by two. There is nothing scary or unpredictable there. Bitcoin originally had no blocksize limit. If we tried large blocks and there was a problem, we could soft fork back to 1MB.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:16:38
No! Lightning isn't ready for the main net! Stark was just talking about this on Twitter...

Either you are trolling or you have eaten too much of the propaganda without understanding the tech. Segwit does not increase node storage requirements - it is a virtual blocksize increase. 
Even so, an actual blocksize increase of limited scope would be a great thing for the network, while having minimal costs for node maintainers: storage is cheap, the block chain can be pruned, and you can always run node software with bandwidth limits if that is a concern (it's what I do for my full nodes).

Pretty simple stuff.

I did too - I just waited for them to confirm. But you and me are power users. This is the same problem Coinbase has with their fee estimation: estimate too low and you get massive customer support burden from users wondering why their payment hasn't arrived. Good money says this is what Steam was dealing with when they finally decided to stop accepting bitcoin. It's really sad but this is the reality of the network right now. Power users like you and me can be smart, consolidate transactions and use segwit addresses, yielding relatively reasonable fees. But for the common user and the merchant, Bitcoin as a network has failed. 
We cannot proceed with how things are now, and we can't wait until Lightning is someday finally ready. Jeff G was unable to deliver on an effective and safe blocksize increase. We need core to coordinate a one time block size increase to buy us time for Lightning to mature. We have the public's attention now; we are going to lose their interest if we can't fix this soon.

Then you just change your direct deposit to deposit into another account. At some point you will need a government and debt collectors for credit to work. Crypto gives no advantage in the credit market; it only complicates things.

This. Core is best understood when thought of as an organization. While there may be a lot of developers that have committed a few lines here or there, most of the work is done by a small group of people that have control of the project. That small group has a specific vision for Bitcoin, and makes tactical decision based on this vision. 
The thing that made this most clear for me was during the 2X drama when they pushed an update to ban perfectly compliant nodes that signaled support for a fork that core did not like. They had a few technical excuses for why they did it, but not having the blacklist operate on a time delay was evidence of bad intentions. That blunder forced the 2X camp to stop signalling, which would have made the split even worse if it happened. 
The decision to politically censure and ban forking code is antithetical to open source culture. Core is best understood as a small, dedicated organization with specific goals.

A block is a section of data in the blockchain containing bitcoin transactions. Miners compete to mine blocks, and the miner that successfully mines a block gets the block reward and any transaction fees present in that block. Blocks have a fixed limit to their size, and can only fit so many transactions. Users incentivize miners to include their transactions into the block (making the transaction "confirmed") by offering a larger transaction fee. This forms what is called the fee market.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:30:27
It sounds frivolous when you put it like that, but small value transactions are critical to some of the third world markets that most need Bitcoin. Lightning has been perpetually "just around the corner" for years now; I'm excited about it, but we need solutions now while we have the world's attention or BTC will miss its chance.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:45:53
It wasn't subsidized by monetary inflation. It was low because of simple supply vs demand economics. Demand for block space has exploded and we have done nothing about supply.

Can I generate a segwit address in Bitcoin-qt yet or do I still have to use bitcoin-cli?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:08:08
That's true. Part of this is me being an early adopting curmudgeon that got into this as a peer to peer electronic cash, with lots of cool apps for contracts. I used to send people a couple bucks in bitcoin to get newbies into it. As of late I have soured on the bitcoin due to the current state of the network. I hope lightning can alleviate some of the congestion, but I would love to see a serious push for some level of on chain scaling. We don't need BCH 8MB blocks, but 2mb blocks - done right - would have been nice.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:13:01
What are you talking about? That was literally in the post explaining their reasoning. They may not pay them, but it looks bad for customers - they had an average fee of $20. 
The network is not working and we are losing adopters. We need to talk about solutions to this that are ready today.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:13:29
Edit: nvrm, I just saw you edited your post. Mine was in response to your original post, the final line here still stands though.
You are handwaving away the important detail here: how can a smart contract enforce non-payment of the loan? Unless you have some sort of crypto asset that could be used as collateral (which, if you did, why do you need a loan), you will still need a system of government to allow debt collection. So if it can't be trustless, decentralizatized, or anonymous, what possible advantage does crypto provide for loans?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:27:42
Currency generally implies it can be used to purchase goods.

Did you read the whitepaper?

Please link me to the license that you are saying applies.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:36:21
Also, core needs to let us generate segwit addresses by default in bitcoin-qt. It is silly that we have to use the command prompt to generate them by hand.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:09:30
It can also only adjust by 4x at a time, so in that scenario it would still take a while for difficulty to adjust.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:44:27
Not spoofed per say, but they can renege on any sort of signalling. It's the best estimate we have of miner support of proposals until we actually see where hashpower goes. 
Now, it would be interesting to see if it was possible to create a way where miners could signal support for proposals by committing a monetary stake into a type of smart contract. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:46:15
Alright, I thought you might be a troll before. Now I'm certain.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:47:22
Okay then. Tell me what license applies to Bitcoin? Give me a link. And no, the license for the reference client (bitcoin-core) doesn't count.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:44:12
Has Bitcoin-core even implemented it on the user interface yet? A couple weeks ago you had to use aconsole command to generate a Segwit address. . .
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:33:37
This. For all that we obsess over btc mooning, no one is talking about how unusable BTC will become if we reach 10x or 100x the value as the fees will scale with it. 2nd layer is nice, but we still need a layer one that won't have $50 fees.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:20:03
It's the reference implementation; it damn well should be a good basic wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:37:52
Your premise is flawed. There is no license behind bitcoin as a network. The existence of one would be counter to bitcoin's core ethos.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:35:47
User consensus cannot be measured in a trustless and decentralized way. Short of a some sort of smart contract requiring an investment of stake (maybe even a decentralized, trustless futures market), signaling is the best way of voting available.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:31:39
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I had to run addwitnessaddress in order to generate a Segwit address.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:20:49
What use cases exist for the regular user that are even remotely competitve with a $100 fee? I can understand that banks and large organizations might still find it useful, but I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be peer to peer electronic cash for the everyman. We have thousands of Venezuelans who make $30 a month relying on Bitcoin - their savings will be wiped with a single transaction fee!

No they aren't! They are constants defined in a header file for crying out loud: 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:08:48
I think moving to a single address before this split in particular is a good idea. If majority hashpower mines 2X, it is going to take a while for difficulty on the 1X to drop (will have to churn through 1152 blocks for diff adjustment). That could be weeks of congestion and high tx fees on the 1X chain. Having your coins in a single address will greatly reduce the fees necessary to get a tx through in order to safely split.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:38:24
The license surrounding the reference implementation is irrelevant. Btc-1 is free to fork off of bitcoin-core and refer to the crypto they support as Bitcoin. The MIT license prevents them from claiming their project is bitcoin-core. Consensus rules are not a legally binding contract. I don't understand where you're getting the idea that there is a legal issue with a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:23:24


LMFAO, now I have seen everything! Look at this asset: it's less liquid so it's obviously more valuable!
Bitcoin has lost so many really cool use cases due to high fees. I am excited about Lightning, but the main chain needs to usable. We can't afford for Bitcoin to moon right now - tx fees will scale with price; I can't afford to spend $50 everytime I want to have a transfer confirm in a timely manner. The chain is NOT ready for mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:24:42




Also correct, but irrelevant. This is comparing 10 to 1 vs 1 to 1.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:07:08
To a certain degree, but if there is a profit disparity between two larger than the cost of exchanging them, they generally mine the more profitable coin and then exchange for their desired coin.

I never agreed to any license when I aquired Bitcoin.

If a hard fork happens - which it is looking like it will - there will be two separate chains with a shared history. If you only care about coins on one chain, you don't have to do anything after the fork aside from making sure you are using the correct wallet. 
However if both coins have value, you will probably want to hodl both or cash one out for another. Because there is no replay protection in 2X (unlike bch fork), a malicious actor that you pay could "replay" your transactions to grab the coins you have on the other chain. 
For instance, say you don't want 2X coins and I do, so you sell them to me. I could replay that transaction to grab your coins on the non-2X (core) chain also. This is because a transaction on 2X is the same as a transaction on the core chain. BCH was different because it had replay protection, meaning they changed transactions so the two wouldn't be compatible.
You protect yourself from this by splitting: after the fork happens, you create a new wallet on both 2X and core. On each chain, use initiate a transfer of all funds from your old wallet to the new one. After all of your transactions have been confirmed, ditch your old wallet and spend coins on each chain using the new wallets. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:47:05
Why only soft? Is there no conceivable upgrade that we would ever want to make that would require modifying consensus rules?
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:27:35
As long as you have the private keys, it doesn't matter. You will need to split if you wish to use both.
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:26:34
I definitely support a blocksize increase - the nuance of my position centers around when 2X should be called "Bitcoin." 
Why do you dislike segwit? As far as a malleability fix, it works well - it just doesn't offer much in the form of on chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:38:46
You're spreading FUD. If you don't care about 2X, just don't interact with that chain. No one can steal your bitcoin. If you want to interact with both, do a split.
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:20:45
It's a complex situation. If you read up on the New York Agreement and the fight to get Segwit actvated, it gives some context. 
A bunch of people on this subreddit insist that it's being pushed by malicious actors. Whether or not that is the case, I think it's more useful to see the 2X fight as a philosophical battle on a number of issues including (but not limited to): node accessibility, on chain scaling, centralization of development, centralization of miners, and consensus. 
The whole thing is complicated, and there is a lot of misinformation being spread about both sides. I recommend you do research come up with your own opinions, but ultimately it will likely be decided by people with a much larger stake than you or I.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:20:41
If S2X becomes the dominant chain, and eventually becomes "Bitcoin", what - aside from pride - stops core devs from releasing a bitcoin-core reference client that has a 2mb blocksize?
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:12:18


 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:13:11
Thank you for your response - that's what I thought. No reason to assume 2X "winning" means core would stop developing. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:05:18
Simplest method: After the split, create a new wallet on each chain. Trade your bitcoin in each chain to its corresponding wallet. After both transactions are confirmed you are safe to use (or hodl) both coins independently. You should then avoid using your original wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:53:08
Only if you interact with the 2X chain without splitting.
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:35:14
How are people making $30 a month using bitcoin when the average transaction fee is over $3? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:19:51
Will it be easy? Maybe.
Simplest way to split is to just wait until after the fork and do a transfer from your old wallet onto a new wallet on each chain and wait for those to confirm.
If people are actively attacking by rebroadcasting all transactions on both chains, then you might not be able to get them split reliably on the forst attempt (instead of A-&gt;B on core and A-&gt;C on 2x, you may get them all moved on to either C or B on both chains). Not really a big deal if this happens, as you still control both wallets.
You can craft an advanced transaction based on nLockTime that takes advantage of the differing chain lengths to do a reliable split, but that's not as simple. Hopefully, if we do end up in a situation where both coins have lasting value, most wallet makers will add functionality to make this easy. 
I have seen this question come up a lot, and there is a lot of misinformation being spread about it. I might create a post detailing how to split safely using nLockTime.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:44:01
What do you care if they're rebroadcasted? If you want to hodl both coins, then split them. If you only care about BTC, do nothing. The existence of the fork doesn't let people steal your coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:07:15
I think you missed the qualifier in my question: in the event - however unlikely - that S2X does "win", why wouldn't core release a 2X reference client? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:22:44
Beyond just LN, fixing transaction malleability allows for lots more On-chain features of bitcoin like atomic swaps. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:21:51
Nlocktime is a way to leverage differing chain lengths to ensure the correct transaction is confirmed on each chain.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:14:20
And it should be. Even as someone who is generally in favor of on chain scaling, I think the fork should be called B2X/BT2/S2X unless it has a dominant market value for a prolonged period of time. I would even go as far to say that as long as the legacy chain maintains at least 20-40% value, it should keep the bitcoin name and ticker symbol. If S2X achieves a stable 80%+ market value then, and only then, can it be viewed as an upgrade - otherwise it should be labeled as an alt.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:35:33
The other difference will be in hash power. Use nlocktime to first transfer your coin on the longer chain. After that has confirmed, initiate a normal transfer to your new wallet on the slower chain.   
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:31:22
It's only a vulnerability if you accept the ridiculous premise that 2X is an attack. It is one of an infinite number of possible modifications to consensus rules. The only reason people are even talking about 2X is because a significant portion of hash power and exchanges are expected to support it. 
Anyone can make a fork off of the live blockchain with whatever modifications they wish. No one cares until you have people lined up to buy and mine your coin. 
2X won't have any impact on the current chain aside from miner attrition (which may end up being temporary as 2X futures don't seem to predict 2X mining to be very profitable). Because of this, fees and confirmation times will probably drastically increase for a while, but this still isn't an attack as miners have zero obligation to mine any coin.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:24:08
Can you link the source on the 10% not supporting 2X? Coin.dance still seems to suggest 93-94% hashpower support.
@_date: 2019-09-02 04:17:54
That's not at all how markets work.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:51:14


This is where you are mistaken - a lack of replay protection does not mean that any transaction will automatically be broadcast on both chains. After the split 2x and core nodes will ban each other (as they will see invalid blocks coming from each other) and the network will fork. Once the fork occurs, your transactions on one chain will not be rebroadcasted on the other unless you are being targeted by a replay attack.
In theory, yes, someone could replay your splitting transactions, but it won't do them any good, as you still control each wallet on each chain.  If that happens, you can simply split again until you get your coins confirmed in different wallets on different chains.
If someone is specifically targeting you and trying to prevent you from splitting your coins, you can craft a more advanced transaction that will take advanatage of differing chain length to split your coins.
But again, the existence of the fork does not allow someone to steal your coins. If you wish to ignore 2x, like many of the members of this sub, it won't affect your btc holdings. You only need to be careful if you wish to interact with both.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:41:15
Honestly curious - why do you think they wouldn't? As we saw with BCH, miners very quickly organized to mine whatever coin (BTC or BCH) that was more profitable at the time. Why do you think this wouldn't be the case for the 2X split?
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:27:10
I don't know of any that natively support both. You would probably have to use two separate wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:50:18
Thanks for the response. I hope we will be able to reduce transaction fees for people like that. A lot of redditors here are incredibly dismissive about the impact of current transaction fees. I'm glad that bitcoin is at least working for you as a store of value.
