Yes. I live on a combination of sheer will and cigarettes.

You're an illinformed moron.
What you see there are "Qualified Rates". It's one of the ways that credit card processors use to get more money out of you. They advertise those rates but those only qualify for certain cards in certain situations. For example, only a debit and pin transaction, only swiped, only from customers that use certain types of cards, and so forth.
That processor most likely charges up to 5-7% for "nonqualified" transactions processed through an internet merchant account. Nonqualified cards are basically everything. Business cards, prepaid cards, gift cards, cards which process through any but a specific network, and so forth. The average rate you end up paying is usually 4-5%. Up to double that if you're a high risk merchant, which being associated with Bitcoin probably makes you. Even more if your credit score isn't perfect. The list goes on.
Lets not forget that the $0.05 has it's own qualifications. There are gateway fees, interchange fees, processor fees. That will most likely end up being *at least* $0.30 or higher per transaction. Potentially higher if doing internet processing.

True. I think I might buy the TV :-)

A TV's value goes down by 30% a year. The dollar goes down by 10% per year. Bitcoin goes up by 5000% per year. Do you sell, buy a TV, or hold?

$0.001 as it has been attacked by a major private institution or government organization. If it even still exists at all.

This is an EXCELLENT idea. Why not become a Payday loan and/or check cashing place? Might get me out of the house more.

Is Silkroad bad for Bitcoin's image? Yes. But not because of Silkroad. Because of the publics perception of drugs.
Taking drugs is a personal choice. Choosing to do so is a stupid personal choice, but a personal choice regardless. The government has no right to say if you can or not so long as you aren't harming anyone other than yourself. The public opinion, because of government programs like DARE, the need to fill private prisons with slave work force, and other demonizations, is that drugs are bad. Therefore Bitcoin being tied to Silkroad is bad because it harms Bitcoin's image.
This is not Silkroad's fault. This is the government's fault, but the end result is still the same. Therefore either Bitcoin needs to gain more legitimate uses (as it's doing so every day), or Silkroad needs to go away. Noticed I said "or". The effect SR is having on Bitcoin's image is weaking every day. To be honest it's not that large of a detractor anymore.
Just my 2 satoshi.
