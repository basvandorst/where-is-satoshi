Coinbase.com is a good place to start

If you wanted to grow your investment, you could look at setting aside a portion of each paycheck to invest at times when the price drops. It will fluctuate a lot so try and be strategic when you buy. Don't invest more then you are willing to lose.

People are treating segwit2x like the end of Bitcoin which is a split that is happening in November. That is different from Segwit which is an upgrade that most of the community is excited about.

This is not the worst crash of bitcoins history by a long shot.

How is the market timetable? The reason why people say to HODL is because many have been burned under "expectation". Don't expect validation here.

Bitcoin is the safest bet but with $100, I wouldn't expect quick gains. If you are looking to take a risk and multiply that substantially then you want to buy newer, cheaper coins with a lot of potential. I would recommend doing your own research on which coins you believe have the most potential and are least likely to be a "scamcoin". 
Personally, I am interested in IOTA as an investment opportunity. The tech is exciting and the dev team seems pretty solid. Waltonchain has potential too but it is brand new and the dev team is not confirmed. Don't take my word for it. Read the whitepapers, read what people are saying on different communities and make up your own mind.

What is your basis for this?

coinbase.com is a great place to start. You can purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin with a debit card. They also have a great app with graphs and prices. I would put the bulk of your investment in Bitcoin if you plan on growing it over time. It is never a bad idea to diversify too. Bitcoin ETH and LTC are all great.

Is this because you are from the future? Or did you just read a Goldman Sachs prediction by chance?

I don't think we will. Or rather, I think the dip after 4900 was the crash. This is different from stocks as it is not tied to anything like the success or failure of a company. There is also a counter balance of long term hodlers who buy the dip causing it to rebound. I would be very surprised if it dropped below 4k ever again.

Fast debit card purchases

A large amount of bitcoin is sold by a single source in a short time. Fear takes hold and people panic sell. The price continues to drop and more sell or trade for other cryptos, not wanting to be left holding the bag. People lose faith in the currency and it crashes to oblivion. 
Im not saying this will happen and seems extremely unlikely, if not impossible, at this point. The more people that hold bitcoin, the more secure it becomes and there is a lot of infrastructure around bitcoin that is not around the other cryptos.

You should rethink your life.
