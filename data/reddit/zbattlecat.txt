yeah, I was actually surprised to see how well it works on my android, I just need to implement touch screen support which is about a day of work. will do this in the following weeks.
mobile app would be great, but won't have time to implement that in a close future, would be ok with outsourcing this to someone for a percentage of earnings, we'll see :D

I'm fairly confident it won't be a problem in the future. 
if playing for money you'd usually play a few games with a person, and introduce BTC if you have a similar skill and is fun, you also chat together. it would be tons of manual labor and technical knowledge to scam people with a bot.
the last resort would be some kind of trust/registration/ban/similar skill matching system.
visible win/lose statistics for everyone will be implemented soon.
lastly, a person with enough skill to manage to avoid many many ways to detect bots could earn way more using these skills differently.

allright people, it was a long day. need to go to sleep.
I got TONS of traffic suddenly, things held up ok, but there is some kind of a memory leak on the server, so the service will restart every once in a while :) I know - awful, everything is being logged though so I will be able to refund if anyone gets any btc issues.
errors are to be expected with a new service as complex as this, bare with me, nothing I can't handle, I'll polish everything up in the following days and weeks to come.
most of the feature requests and more are already on my todo list and will be implemented.

I think that automatic name generator might be more fun then the game itself

yeah it might be high, I'm totally open to lowering the rake, will experiment, maybe with taking a percentage only on withdrawals. 
I'd just like for the service to be able to support itself, all the BTC will go back in, if we get enough we'll be able to continue the development and expand.

hey ppl, game programmer here.
The site launched a few days ago, it was a lot of work and I'm super happy to see the interest. It's fairly stable but sometimes a bug turns up, bare with me, pls use the support form to submit it and it will be fixed quickly :)
I'm planning to implement a series of tournaments with BTC rewards in the close future as a promotion, follow our twitter/fb/whatever (links on the site) ( for anouncements.
love bomberman, played it a lot in the past and I really wanted to see a skill based game in which you can get BTC for winning. If this works, I plan to implement new games and expand the bomberman itself.
