Why would they shut off over night, exactly? Still looking for a shred of meaningful information from you.
Also, again, please disclose any financial conflicts of interest as well as if your employer gains from or plans to use "layering" in its business plan.

Or maybe no one wants rate limited Bitcoin with soft forked SW? Listing a bunch of crypto-politicians doesn't change results.

Look more closely at who is bankrolling developers and choose the obvious answer.

The problem is, even if you subscribe to a view that Bitcoin is "digital gold" and are willing to abandon the idea of it being a form of p2p electronic cash, it still falls short of being digital gold at 1MB blocks. 
Private transactions happen in gold all the time. If the Bitcoin network can't support more than 3 transactions per second natively, and we are only planning to increase this via L2 networks with unproven and highly suspect properties around decentralization, it seems that Bitcoin's future even as just "digital gold" is in jeopardy.
Bottom line, we need BIP101 or a flexible cap that raises the blocksize based on math, not (paid) developer sentiment. I am skeptical that BU will be accepted because there is a real risk with very large blocks of centralization. People "poo pooing" this risk are almost as deceptive and disingenuous as the people working for blockstream are about 1MB blocks. 
BU should go to market "as is", but use a default block size that increases at certain block depths to mirror BIP101. This way, miners and users can still change their settings, but the default that "ships" with the software mirrors Moore's Law - 10% per annum.
I think THAT would actually get majority support. Either BU with BIP101 defaults, or we need a 2MB hard fork with better support than the first time around. Anything else will be Classic 2.0, or a project that sacrifices chances of success for emotional reasons rather than pragmatism.
I also think Classic and BU need to join forces RIGHT NOW and agree to a conservative plan like I outlined above (BU with BIP101 defaults and a fast solution for quadratic hashing issues that is easier to implement than flexible transactions). We need a viable short term plan. And then we need some MAJOR community support for it.
This will either be successful on its own, or motivate the core team to listen more to user and community feedback. The inertia is a cost, just like taking risks in other areas. Every year we lose since 2014 is another year that crypto isn't changing the world for better.
If this community was actually on the up and up, core would be working on 2MB HF + SegWit as a hard fork RIGHT NOW. Not fussing about MAST, Lightning Networks, or whatever the latest panacea is today. We are not seeing practical planning to help bitcoin short term from core, and with the economic incentives / privatization of payroll, censorship here and elsewhere, well, it is creating a lot of mistrust.

Lightning isn't used by people in real life to move money around today and is still being alpha tested, so you don't know if it is centralized or not.
People (including me) who have reviewed the onion routing approach believe it will encourage bigger hubs with more connections that will lead to regulation.
It certainly does not have the same decentralized properties and careful design of full Bitcoin nodes.

Meh, yeah, I want off on a tangent, but it was in response to your post. Bits assumes that the value keeps going up, which we still thought would happen in 2014. That isn't likely to happen with perma-1MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-29 21:46:20
Have you read the code for onion routing? It clearly favors hubs with more connections and more bitcoin locked up. That's a force for centralization and KYC. 
"Layering" compromises privacy and decentralization. Saying that any increase to the maxblocksize "risks the security and decentralization of Bitcoin" is FUD. 
Prove it with data and cut out the FUD. Also, please disclose any financial conflicts of interest as well as if your employer gains from or plans to use "layering" in its business plan.
