I know you're not trolling, I'm not either.  I don't think LN is going to be a success; I too don't rely on trust--trustless was the magic of Bitcoin.
Regarding your first question: the auto-close n-locktime TX is what sets the channel-duration... Or at least as I understand it.  The subsequent broadcasts aren't done on-chain--broadcasting on-chain closes the channel.

Any how does 8mb block size increase centralization...? If your answer is just full nodes becoming too expensive then don't bother answering, since I literally run a full node and it's inconsequential, furthermore, the vast (vast) majority of people are using light wallets.  However, if you have another reason then I'd like to hear it, genuinely.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:12:18
I'm pretty sure you're misunderstanding the concept of the mempool... The mempool is just storing queued transactions, so emptying it every block means everyone's TX was included in that block.  I think what you're thinking of is an empty mempool AND no transactions are being queued into the network/mempool (which would mean BTC is dead, IMO).  Additionally, unless we're talking past the year 2140, miners are always incentivized to mine because they receive a block reward.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:51:50
It's less bad than that, but I believe the core problem is there, yes.  It's not a matter of "whoops you're disconnected", it's more, "whoops you're offline when the channel expired", so there's a bit of timing involved.  I posted a whole thread and got some feedback on the problem.  The tl;Dr of the thread is that: yes the problem exists, so only open channels to people you trust.
Here is the best reply I got from my thread:.

Okay, so I read the paper. Super interesting read.  However, their estimates for node dropoff can't be taken as fact.. they even say this on page 7:


tude of other factors influencing the capability of Bitcoin nodes that could not be assessed without a
large-scale modeling.
Also, it looks like they modelled a lot of these stats off just one node... Doesn't seem very thorough, but even if I give them the benefit of the doubt, then it's still not really enough to convince me it'd kill full nodes.  Here is my mindset:
Say we increase blocksize to 8MB. We're not automatically filling 8MB every block--today we'd be filling less than 2MB, but let's just say it's 2MB. Then go through their chart and look at the requirements for a 2MB node... It's well within reason for modern day. It's less than what people use in gaming machines.  Now, if we started filling 8MB immediately, then that'd be crazy (kind of in a cool way--it'd mean BTC is more active than PayPal), but it would also be the high end of what people could run at home, as your average layman.  But I think applying some foresight to this problem is important: forks are hard! Consensus is difficult. So let's take a 5 year plan approach to scaling and set it to 8MB and reevaluate as we go.
But honestly, thanks for sharing this thread and the paper.  I feel more informed by reading it--despite us drawing separate conclusions.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:47:59
My understanding is that this is correct.  However, it's not that you won't have your chain closed, it's that you won't be able to update it, which actually is a vulnerability since it gives the other end of the channel the ability to close out the channel with an old overwritten signature.
Example:  A and B have a channel.  1 BTC each. A sends B 0.5 BTC. B sends back 0.25 BTC. Balance should be A = 0.75, B = 0.25. If A gets disconnected, B can publish the first Tx where the balance was A = 0.5 and B = 0.5.  LN relies on timelocks ("publish no earlier than X") to secure the network, so it assumes each node will publish the newest Tx, but there is nothing enforcing it if the benefiting node is offline.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:33:58
Hey! Thanks for linking something interesting.  Give me a minute to read the paper (
I agree we need to validate the network with nodes, but it's not to the extent that people are expecting.  Even Satoshi said light wallets should be far more common than full node wallets.  Also, I don't care to discuss what the network looks like at 1GB blocks; I'm advocating for a reasonable increase for now.  Demonizing anything other than 1MB blocks will make an upgrade later (like the one necessary to scale LN) even harder--not to mention the fact that demonizing even 8MB blocks is just technically wrong (pending reading your paper).
I am curious about the claim of 60% of nodes, I'll be back.
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:30:59
False. Segwit transactions aren't smaller or compressed; they're "weighed" differently.  Which means that more TX are allowed in a block because they don't count the witness data as counting towards block size.  In the end, the amount of bytes in a block are still more than 1MB.
Look at one of the more recent blocks.  The total size in MB are larger than 1k:

You're not OP, nor are you bringing anything of value to this conversation.  You're just reaffirming that there's nothing supporting the centralization argument other than opinions I don't agree with (note: opinions, not facts).
8 times inconsequential is still inconsequential.  We're discussing a reasonable increase in block size.
Full nodes are only used to propagate transactions.  The current network is NOT too centralized.  Read the damn white paper if you're going to be advocating for shit, man.  If you care about the actual tech then research it instead of just parroting misinformation.

Bitcoin Cash is not a scam.  It's Bitcoin with an increased block size to allow 8 times the number of transactions per second.  Further proof of its legitimacy: you can buy it on Coinbase (which is arguably the most popular crypto exchange).
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:36:51
You are correct that the newest transaction always has the shortest n-locktime, however they're not "auto-closed"--so it's reliant on the benefitting party to broadcast the Tx on-chain to close it.  The only "auto-close" Tx is the initial one to open the channel.
If you know something I don't, then please link me the article/paper/video describing otherwise.  I'll admit that LN is tremendously complicated, so it's easy to get my understandings wrong (and for others to do the same).

"hostile takeover attempts".  Yeah, okay.  And how does one exactly perform a hostile action vs a distributed crypto?

Nothing.  The current meta is that everyone is boycotting non-segwit exchanges, when there aren't any reliable ones that offer it (no, Gemini does NOT support segwit).  Additionally, people got upset because coinbase opened BCH trading.  They're claiming it was insider-trading, but they announced they were implementing BCH support before the end of the year MULTIPLE times.  So, in the end, it's just people being angsty for childish reasons.

I appreciate this debate. Honestly.  Thanks for being a role model on this forum for how these debates should be had.  I respect you.
I think what we're concluding is that we have a different perspective on what is the right choice.  I supported Bitcoin Cash once Segwit2x was dropped.  I view bigger blocks to be less risky than the current situation, but I will say that in the end we'll just have to see how it ends.
I'm happy to debate more in the future with you. Happy New Year.

I hope you enjoyed venting, because your rant hasn't said anything of real substance.
I don't see how Ver has anything to do with this; he's just a dude that  I couldn't care less about.
There is no such thing as "stealing resources".  It's a democracy, so if people think the other tech is better, then they vote with their resources--it's not stealing; no one owes anyone anything.
Again, I don't care about Ver.  Bitcoin Cash is called Bitcoin Cash; it's terrifically hypocritical to be calling it "BCash" and then also bitch about Bitcoin Cash taking over the name "Bitcoin".
There is no such thing as a "hostile" takeover.  There is no army invading peoples' homes.  It's just voting, adoption, and tech.
I'm very well informed about what a 51% attack is, and I am also well informed about Big Blocks.  You should actually check out the research done by Stanford.  They got Gigabit blocks running in a distributed fashion on hardware that is no better than an average gaming computer.  Check it out if you're actually interested in learning.  It was Stanford research, not some guy in a basement.  I feel like that deserves some merit and respect.
Again, Ver.  I don't care.  You're calling things a scam that genuinely aren't, which dilutes the meaning of what a "scam" is.  It also makes you sound like a fearmonger and it makes you sound uninformed--relying too much on emotional arguments.
I already touched on the topic of "theft" or resources.  It's voting.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:01:56
is correct on this regard.  Think of LN as a prepaid giftcard: you load it with funds, then make multiple purchases with it over time to the same vendor.  The additional feature is that once you spend any amount of the money on your gift card, you can get a refund on the remaining amount back.  Additionally, if you don't use all of the funds on your prepaid giftcard after its expiration date, you get it the balance back as BTC.  (If you don't spend any money on your gift card, though, you won't be able to get any of it back until its expiration.)
However, while having its use-cases, LN is *NOT* going to resolve all of the TX Congestion.  The LN only mitigates repeat transactions to/from the same parties.  So if most of the transactions on the network are unique sender/receiver pairs, then the number of transactions is actually going to double if they used LN (one TX to open the channel, and one to close it).
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:09:18
I don't really support segwit, and currently, neither does the majority of the network. But I agree, if it reaches mass adoption then perhaps it will help resolve some of the current problems, but I don't think it will be enough by itself. In the end, your first point is still incorrect: Satoshi was NOT against larger blocks--he just wanted to wait until it was absolutely necessary.

However, if you're point is that ASICs are breaking decentralization, then I totally agree with you. If our PoW was something more memory intensive, like scrypt, then yeah: totally.  But I still don't know if I'd qualify that as claiming SHA256 is "broken".

Nice job spreading blatant lies. Bitcoin Cash is literally the same thing as Bitcoin Core except the block size is bigger and it doesn't have segwit. If you think 2MB blocks are too big and cause centralization then you should also be against segwit, because its effective on-disk size is almost the same. (1.8 MB vs 2 MB)
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:00:59
Checked out your link.  I can't follow the conclusion you're drawing.  Are you saying that because literally 2 people are paying 500 sat/B, 2 @ 550, and 2 at 600 are paying extra (read: not necessary)  fees, that BCH is a failed experiment?  I don't follow that logic at all.  Anyone can put in any fee they want.  For instance, when I sold some of my bitcoin a few weeks ago, I transferred 32 BTC with a fee of 815 sat/byte; why? Because the extra money simply wasn't worth the risk of not having my tx confirm.  Did I have to pay that much?  Nope.  My point is: just because high TX fees were paid, doesn't mean the the network is congested (or even that it was necessary).
In short: I'm not seeing what you're seeing.  6 x 500 sat/b TX does not congestion make.
Oh, also keep calling me a shill and also please keep assuming I make less than you.  It's really funny from my perspective (_Who's the Roger Ver, now?_).  The reality is that I have a lot of time and money invested in both BTC and BCH, so keeping myself educated and educating others is worth it to me.
Have a happy holiday.

Listen, I know the role of nodes. I literally run one. Google how to set up a full node on Debian and you'll find scripts that I personally wrote. I've been around Bitcoin since 2012.
Larger blocks do not make running full nodes inaccessible to the general public.  I'm repeating myself here, but ah well: segwit and BCH require almost the same disk space for a full node. About 63 GB / year for both. (1.8 MB / block vs 2 MB / block)
Secondly, we don't need a million full nodes.  Propagation throughout the network requires a lot fewer nodes than you think.  If you want my opinion on the real "danger" of centralization, then it's that ASICs became a thing, making local miners much less practical. But that's besides the point, and once again, has little to do with block size.
If you have more than a few thousand dollars invested in either branch then research more.  Otherwise, STFU and stop spreading misinformation to people who are trying to educate themselves.

That's congruent with a lot of the other BCH supporters.  The hate against BCH by BTC is very very silly, since they're almost completely the same thing, especially if you don't care about segwit (which has been proven that the added complexity and insecurity is not worth the (lack of) benefit).
Check out the BCH subreddits, and you'll see the conversation is much more mature than it is here... Unfortunately.

What I want: a block size upgrade like one that is talked about by Satoshi in the white paper, and also on the forums before he disappeared.  The same block size upgrade that a LOT of people wanted, like Segwit2X and even before that... I know you're going to respond with "but centralization!!!111", so don't bother: I'm yet to see any proof that larger blocks will have a negative affect, and any examples of proof to the contrary (like the success of Bitcoin Cash) are insufficient to convince you.  So let's just acknowledge the difference of opinion here. Stop playing coy by saying you do not "know what dissenters want".  We want larger blocks: we want Bitcoin to be a currency again.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:08:31
I've agreed with you in the past on some things, but I think you're not correct this time around.  The "network" component of LN is only practical if the intermediate nodes have exceptionally funded channels opened... which also means those intermediate nodes are okay with having those funds in escrow for the duration of the channel.  So, I don't believe your "network" understanding is really
 going to be practically used the way you're envisioning it.

I reread you post, and yeah, I didn't quite get your point originally. You're saying that things are fixed by segwit, and that a fork wasn't necessary because things are fixed if you use segwit.
My point is that if you have issues with segwit, then the problem isn't fixed. I can't say if service providers, like bitpay, aren't using segwit because they don't agree with it, or for other reasons. Wish I knew.

Oh, I think we were talking about slightly different things--and actually from your perspective, I think you are indeed correct: if there has been a transfer on the channel, then that channel can be published early.
To clarify the case I was talking about--and I could be wrong here--my understanding is that if there hasn't been any transfer on the channel, then the receiving party hasn't signed a transaction to "publish early". In that case, the initiator has funds locked up until the channel expiration. This understanding was derived from the presentation given by Core--which is why he was saying that the channel expiration time should be smaller than the one he listed in his example (which was a month).
But really: this is all terribly complicated, and I'll admit that I can have an incorrect understanding.

Curious about this.
It's my understanding that "getblocks" messages only returns blocks from the "best" chain as decided by the peer. So, you can invalidate a block, but unless the rest of world jumps ship, you'll only receive blockhashes that include that "invalid" block until a fork surpasses it.
Unless I'm mistaken, of course.

@_date: 2018-09-24 01:50:28
Thanks, man.  And yeah, that makes sense.  I was trying to validate my logic for `getblocks` was correct.  One thing that I currently lament about the current protocol is there isn't a way to request blocks for a particular chain.
Regarding the situation the (local) OP was referring to, if the exploit wasn't found until many blocks in the future of it being executed, a rollback would take the same amount of time for miners to fork and then overtake the invalid chain.  During that time, a node wouldn't be able to ask for blocks on the other chain.  So despite invalidating the block fork, other nodes wouldn't be able to see progress until the new chain completely overtook it.
_However_, after your reply and after thinking about it more, I think I was missing a key point to an "actual" scenario.  Ideally, a lot of nodes would invalidate the invalid block/fork--which would would (probably) cause them to no longer consider that chain valid at all, which would also affect their `inv` reply to `getblocks`.  So the nodes _would_ actually be receiving blocks before it overtook the longer chain due to the other nodes changing their concept of the "best" chain.
That sounds logical.  It also makes me lament the protocol's current inability to request abandoned blocks less than I used to.

Follow-up to both segments:
- That's a little disappointing. The longer the period, the longer my funds are locked up in the case of a refund. I know your example was an extreme, but in order to mitigate the scenario, I wouldn't receive a refund for up to 200 days... that's a long time. To be practical though 30 days can seem reasonable if I'm just buying a lot of coffees or something, but if I'm moving a significant value amount--say a Tesla--, then it doesn't seem like a good use case.
- But the transaction _was_ signed by both. This would just mean that it's important that both parties take special precaution to ensure the fees are the same for all "updates" to the TX. If left up to the persons themselves, then I can totally foresee people scamming grandma out of refunds because she failed to notice that subsequent fees are less valuable than the original. (All I'm saying is it gets complicated to use safely if this is true...)

Thanks for the reply. I don't think ur first point needs to be expanded further--if that's the assumption, then sure.
The second point: the exploit occurs if the first transaction has higher fees than the subsequent one. So, in the original example, the 0.2 to Bob is the first TX and assume it has a super high fee of 0.05 btc, the "refund" (or amendment) TX sets it to 0.1 to Bob, but this one has a reasonable fee of 0.001 (or whatever). Would miners not be incentivized to ignore the second/amended TX since its fee is lower--especially if broadcasted within a small time window of one another?
Still, very possible I'm misunderstanding the mechanic. Thanks for taking the time to reply.

I don't believe that's a feasible vector, here's why:  Say a mining pool generates transactions to itself, puts them in its mempool, but doesn't broadcast them.  The only way the mempool is evaluated is through `mempool` messages which [returns a list of transaction hashes in its pool](  Those transactions can be any size, so just counting the number of transactions returned by this message isn't enough--the fee-estimating node will have to request the txns via `getdata`.  If the malicious miner node chooses to not respond to the `getdata` message, then the transaction should not be recorded by the estimating node as being in the mempool (since the estimating node has no idea if that transaction hash points to a tx that is 65 bytes or 1,000,000 bytes--let alone if it's even a valid transaction and not just a nonsense hash).  If the malicious miner does respond to the `getdata` message, then it is effectively broadcasted to the network, meaning if any of the other 7 mining consortiums mine the next block, then the malicious miner will actually be paying the regular fees for that transaction to another miner and not to itself, causing it to lose money.  This observation is supported by the fact mining pools don't currently spam the network with transactions--it's too costly and their margins are low enough as it is.
Alternatively, the miner can choose to not expose its mempool at all and just create full blocks.  If the fee estimators are naively only using the metric of "was the last block full? then take the minimum fee included in that block and make that the new required fee", then sure, the estimators will have a poorly estimated fee.  However, by using this strategy, it costs the miners money due to opportunity cost: By filling their own blocks when there are other people willing to pay for that space, they are losing out on potential revenue.  It's a similar game-theory that discourages miners from simply mining empty blocks.  This case would be very similar to the mining node just setting its `feefilter` to something above average and refusing to mine any non-overly-expensive transactions.  Additionally, miners have a lot of infrastructure capital invested in the success of the network, so its success is inherently driven by people using and valuing their block reward; if the network isn't doing anything, then it's not going to be perceived as valuable.
Let me know if I'm not thinking of something that enables this attack vector.  I know you know I'm a dev "for the other team", but this discussion is completely devoid of any block-size controversy, so I hope we can instead begin to talk like colleagues trying to improve the world via cryptocurrencies, instead of two sects of the same religion threatening to blow one another up because we pray facing a different direction.

I'm a bitcoin developer (by that I mean that I'm implementing a bitcoin full node from scratch)... and after reading BIP70, I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.  I agree with you.  OP seems like a spam account fear-mongering and posting garbage.

So to be clear: there is not actual lawsuit.. this is an "article" about how people want one.  Fox News quality reporting.

Sounds more like misinformation to me.

Definitely possible. I thought it would be too at first, but then I saw the address starts with a 1 and then also doesn't use any characters outside of the Bas58 encoding... So who creates a stock photo of the malware and then is savvy enough to create an address that is a reasonable-looking address?
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:35:09
I don't believe so. The point of that address is that it's so specific that it's not practically possible to have the key. Thus why it's a bitcoin eater: no one can retrieve those coins.

Nice find. Yep, that seems to match the description, too. I'm surprised how many people paid.

You shouldn't use blur to hide sensitive information. It can be undone (to some extent). Congratulations on holding though.
