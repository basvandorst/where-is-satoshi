Just paid for an ad. Hopefully it won't take hours to confirm with this "stress test" happening right now.

Also check out CoinRebates.com, which launched last week. You can get cash back from travel sites like Expedia and Hotels.com, as well as popular retailers like Newegg and Walmart.

Waiting isn't a great option for us at the moment as our users are growing impatient, and we can't even provide a good estimate of how long the wait would take.
How would I go about re-broadcasting the transaction with a higher fee? We're using the JSON-RPC compatible API on blockchain.info.

Can you answer my question?
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:56:22
One suggestion. A useful feature would be the ability to target certain countries. I would pay extra to get traffic from the US for example.
@_date: 2015-07-12 10:10:43
Yeah we realized that too late. We just used the default provided by blockchain.info's API, and it's worked fine up until the recent "stress test".
I imagine there are many in our situation. Is there any way for us to resend these transactions with a higher fee?
@_date: 2015-07-13 01:48:15
Yes, I would be willing to pay for the certainty that a transaction will get confirmed. I actually sent wizkid057 an email but haven't received a response yet. If you could help with this, I would be willing to compensate for your time or make a donation to the Eligius pool.

Cool idea. I bet I could get a few friends to tip me for wearing one of those.

Thanks for your interest. 1 BTC is currently worth about $132 USD, so that makes 250 uBTC worth about 3 and a half cents.
You can sell bitcoins right from Coinbase, or there are many vendors where you can spend them. We wrote a blog article about some options here:

We're still paying at bitcoinget.com!

I propose the following renaming:
μBTC -&gt; bit,
satoshi -&gt; bitcent
1 million bits makes 1 bitcoin.

If you're willing to do a bit of work, popular "earn" sites can get you a lot more than the faucets. Have a look at the microtasks on [BitcoinGet]( for example.

Nice list! We're bitcoinget.com.

Unfortunately there are factors beyond my control. The advertiser tracks the activity and determines whether a view is qualified and ultimately paid. I agree the money you make from the site won't replace having an actual job, but hopefully it serves a purpose for those new to Bitcoin and wanting to earn a small amount to play with.

Yeah, seems people aren't too receptive of April Fool's shenanigans. I tried one too and didn't work too well. Here it is in case you're interested:
