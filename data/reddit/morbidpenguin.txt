Haven't watched the video; I'm not at home.
I'm guessing you buy them from the iBon kiosk? Can you scan the barcode of the wallet you want to send it to?
This seems pretty cool. Good on FamilyMart for doing it. 7-11 next.

Thanks. I usually hit up 7-11 out of convenience and habit, so I assumed they were all iBon-type things.
Watched the video. This looks pretty cool. Great way to get them quickly (Circle does accept US credit cards &amp; I have my US bank account hooked up), but this is definitely a good alternative for Taiwanese/foreigners/someone who doesn't want to go through the process of signing up for Circle.

Thanks for breaking down the different levels. Just getting into bitcoin, and this was definitely helpful for me!

The failed notification was on Circle or on your bank website?
It is still pending on Circle or on your bank website?

I'll order you two pizzas for 10,000 BTC.

Have you confirmed with your bank that the debit card was charged?
I've only bought Bitcoin twice with circle, both times with a credit card, not a debit. The Bitcoin was instantly credited to my account. Maybe the debit card needs the standard 4-5 days similar to a bank account for the deposit to go through.

I filled it out. Quick and easy.
Good luck to your girlfriend on her thesis.

Are you sure? Nothing in the App Store or on the Mycelium website. Last I heard they were updating it because of serious bugs with sending money.

That's one thing the dev can hopefully fix. I just realized that Mycelium on Android gives you a choice when you send. Normal is 100 bits, priority is 200 bits, and economic is 10 bits. Would be nice to have this option (rather than just on/off) in breadwallet.

I recently installed Lubuntu on an old Laptop (Dell Latitude M500, bought around 2003) and plan on using it as an offline wallet/paper wallet printer.
Would it be secure enough to install electrum as an offline wallet and run the paper wallet website from local files and have a strong password on the user account?
I would also perhaps want a password manager like Keepass using the database file and another strong password to store the seeds and keep it backed up on an additional flash drive.
This laptop is never going to touch the internet again, but I'm wondering if this is safe enough/not safe at all. Would it be better to run it off USB/flash media or run it off the hard drive and keep stuff backed up?

Read the FAQ: Do not mine. You will lose money. It is not worth it.
As for wallets that I use (and that seem to get recommended a lot here):
Windows: Electrum
Android: Mycelium
IOS: Breadwallet

This. Use bitcoinpaperwallet.com, download the zip file, open the webpage in your liveusb, and print it.

Welcome to Taiwan. The paperwork and red tape here can be frustrating at the best of times, especially for foreigners. You're very lucky to have a native girlfriend help you manage these things.
Hopefully, one day soon, Bitcoin in Taiwan will have real primary applications, not secondary uses like this. 加油!

Nice. Now Ruin will never be able to alter it.

Yes
