Ask your accountant!! It's their responsibility to know, they're meant to keep upto date with tax laws!! 
I should know, I am actually an accountant myself!

Hey, here's a little guide I put together that should help you out!

I'm an accountant specialising in personal tax etc. 
You won't have to pay any capital gains on profits in a year as long as your profits are below £11,300! 
Rule of thumb, if you want to cash out. Transfer coins to USD/EUR/GBP. Sell enough to make £11,300 profit a year. As a result you won't have to file a tax return, nor will you pay any taxes!
The tax free allowance changes each year in the budget. So bear that in mind!!

People should stop listening to an OAP. 
Doubt he even knows how to use a computer. We all know, anything that generation doesn't understand is rubbish in their eyes. 
Heck, I don't even know who Warren buffet is.

No offense taken! I'm fairly new to crypto. Waking up.

HMRCs rules wouldn't constitute buying and selling as a trade. Any profits made this way would be subject to capital gains tax. Sale of bitcoin would only be taxable upon conversion to fiat currently. 
So if you bought £200 bitcoin, made £200. Sold so your profit was £200 and balance £400. You then purchase Tron for £400 and make £2,000. So you have £2,400.
At this point you sell all your currency and withdraw to £. Your cost was £200. Therefore profit £2,200. This is your taxable amount on your return. 
The only time you would be classed a trader is if you mined the coins yourself.

In the UK, all crypto currencies are classed as assets. The only time a taxable event occurs is when you sell that asset for Fiat currency. 
So, in answer to the question. In the UK, that wouldn't be a taxable event. However, you would need to keep track of the profits you make. As on each sale, the profit is crystallised (carried forward). The entire profit that is made will be taxable upon sale for any type of currency.

Do you have a full time job? Or are you doing this as a 'job'?
Tax would only be applicable to realised profits. So if you never sell, you'd never have to pay. 
That's the way the ledgeslation works at the moment. I don't think there are any plans to change it in the near future!

You're wrong... And even if you were right. There's something called rollover relief which would cover it.

I'm thinking something similar to Sky News. On 24/7, can always tune in. Going through the most recent stories as they happen. Debunking FUD. 
Honestly, I like your idea. But it feels like you want to be paid for a 30 minute show, with no credibility. Which could be aired on YouTube or something similar. 
Also, if you're uploading weekly videos. Is the information going to be up to date or are we going to be a week behind?

There's a crypto currency called Lend that will do it! There are also other altcoins that are working on their own projects!! 
But seriously, are you guys into bitcoin?! If so, you should check out Enigma, I promise you. Read into it, you'll both love it. They're a fairly newish company with some amazing ideas! I've been following them since October and the price per coin has shot up to $8!! Currently stood at $5.6 but ready to shoot up at any moment!
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:14:10
Do it!! 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:10:18
Please could someone put together a decentralised news channel. 
Beginning to hate the media!

If the guy from bitcoin.com is saying sell. He's probably waiting to buy at the lowest point and trying to crash the market to take advantage... 
If he really was selling, he would be telling people to buy so he gets a better price.

Two days in a row though 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:16:38
No worries! Thanks for the heads-up, adjusted
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:11:51
I fear it could drop to atleast 13,000usd. I'm not a professional or anything though.
