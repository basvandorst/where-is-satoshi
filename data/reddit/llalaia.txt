How's so? Modern crypto technologies that were released after Bitcoin and provide innovative features do not inspire you at all?  Did you give a close look any of them?

I've notice their doesn't seem to be a lot of mobile apps for bitcoins besides wallets.
Gyft is also leading the charge of using bitcoins on apps, but its still slow to evolve onto mobile. Are Apple and Google responsible or am I missing something?

I was so  surprised how rumors can affect Bitcoin price. Doesn't it make Bitcoin to loose it's reputaion?

i think it calls time for a moriarty 'shoe on head' type of event to reveal himself publicly and self dox his identity. seeing as he supposedly has so much legit business.
does anyone of his customers know his true identity. and should we be trusting someone with 50 businesses to hide away?.. i think not

Well seeing as they haven't actually specified why the Willy report was taken down you can't really say it was or wasn't justified. If there is nothing else at play - ie no real breakage of the Wordpress TOS then I would be suspecting some kind of foul play, but realistically I'm not convinced of an affiliation between Gox and Wordpress. Much more likely something went wrong and they took it down.

Good joke! Doesn't this MtGox's advertisment tell about their incompetence even in hiring new staff?

damn it.  This doesn't work for me either at work!  Guess I'll have to give it a try later!  How many BTC can you win?
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:01:16
Sounds like it's not a hobby but a lifestyle ! You are bitcoin junkie !
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:44:27
What are you doing, PayPal?? Why?? That's not fair
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:33:47
Yup, well done. Bitcoinaverage has been my go-to site for a week now.
Would be even better if it included a chart though..

if engraving, do not use a remote bitcoin service for it. instead go to a local store in your town that engraves metal or glass and get them to do it. 
firstly due to the fact that he is less likely to even know what bitcoin is to even care what he is engraving, secondly you can be in more control of watching him to ensure he doesnt keep a copy. thirdly you know where he physically is and able to make a return visit to slap him with a wet fish if he did screw you

im starting to think that Dr Michael Moriarty. is a trendon shavers like guy with a pseaudonym hinting at his lack of morals.
EG pirate. known scallywag that steals from others in the international waters
moriarty. known criminal mastermind with a network of criminal activity he can access at any time.

The more people believe in bitcoin the more merchants accepts it as a payment option,they don't wanna loose costumer who uses bitcoin by not accepting bitcoin directly
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:38:40
Is this a joke? " I want gox to get up and running" - who is ever going to use MtGox after everything they have done to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-29 17:23:34
Facebook is used by pretty much anyone who has internet. Theoretically bitcoin can become just as popular but not more popular unless facebook nosedives. We can't have more users than "pretty much anyone who uses internet", can we?

In this case, when this forum is forum is a place for Mining Anonymous! We have lost our souls forever

Agreed. I also really liked the logic of this piece and I caught myself thinking about the fact that ‘Oh, my God! it is really easy to be tricked by the altcoins which promote that they are better than the previous coin in their marketing materials, while in reality the change is so minor that I hardly need to pay attention to it.
