Wait, what ?

What dip would it be if it wouldn't?

Scam implies an intent to fraud. They are just overwhelmed with the increase of requests, as is practically every other exchange. Just calm down, I'm sure they will fill your order.

Hope this doesnt trigger another crash :/ 
coinbase get your f*cking sh*t together

Best decision you'll ever make. Yes, all you need is the seed to access your funds. Best store it safely and in at least in two places. If your ledger is stolen it is worthless without a pin and will wipe itself when the pin is incorrect 3 times. Therefore never keep your ledger together with the pin written down.
Have fun in crypto, to the moon!

Ok I get you now. I predict an incoming dip to 11k.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:19
Everybody panic! Lol you guys, chill out
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:08:52
Complaining is okay, but to call someone a scammer is something entirely different.

Never had a  problemwith litebit , you probably didn't verify your bank account properly. Better pull this post before you get in legal trouble.

They won't become banks, but they are a vital part of bitcoins infrastructure, so they got a lot of power. But I don't see how they would profit buy messing with bcs traffic.
NO REGERTS!
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:55
Don't see no dip y'all
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:49:32
Ha? Why should it?
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:58:07

@_date: 2017-11-19 11:31:04

How do you like those headphones? Are they worth their money?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:43:40
Congrats, have fun

I rather have sustainable growth than a exponential explosion in price that will not only end in a crash, but may also destroy the whole crypto market once and for all. Aside from that a btc stagnation would strengthen its role as reliable store of value and would give other cryptos the possibility to step out of its shadow. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:55
Ze worst is over
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:56:55
Haha, good that this ended well ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:51
Lol keep cool
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:23:19
Everyone will give you a different answer and those who hold bitcoin are obviously incentivised to tell you to buy, but I for one would never ever buy something at its all time high - not stocks, not alts and bitcoin is no different. So if you really, really want to invest in bitcoin, wait for a healthy correction of at least 20%. My 2 Cents
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:03:45
What I really pray for is stabilization of btc price - ideally a stagnation for at least a year on this level.

Lol thought the same thing :D I guess that was quite the damp squid :P
