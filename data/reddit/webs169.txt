Wow this hurts.  Coinbase is how I first bought bitcoin.   Feeling of such betrayal and mocking it's hard to express.

Every single other exchange was like that at the end of last year.

Would it be using segwit or did I have to change something in options or something?

So I log in put my pin and see if my coins are in regular or legacy.  Ok thank you!

His intent was clearly to shame him there's no going back from that.

Why do you guys just assume this from coincidence?  Do yoh have any kind of source at all?  I thought the biggest demand has been in japan and south korea..

Ready and waiting to pull the trigger!  Just let us know, when and where :-)

I think  Bitcoin probably did today a liquidity Spike there was too much demand from buyers and there weren't enough sellers for a short time so with every sale it started to Skyrocket upwards then when people saw the price and began to sell it went right back down because the liquidity Spike ended and there was enough sellers for buyers

I have a trezor wallet, is there anything I need to do if I wanted to send to gemini for example or does the wallet do it for me?

What horror stories did you hear?  Genuinely curious.

If people short it but bitcoin goes up like it has been won't they just lose out?

He doesn't buy anything but neccessities, he has a different outlook on life and is a minimalist.  He even sold his house.  That said, he only takes payment in bitcoin and only uses bitcoin unless he simply can't.  Do you know something we don't or are you being misleading?   He is all in 100% bitcoin is what he stated publicly he just doesn't believe in materialism and therefore isn't looking for wealth.  But he is all in!
Edit:  This is so stupid, you say yourself he rarely uses fiat then how can he buy bitcoin if all he has is bitcoin!  Use your head, I'll give you a moment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:18:54
I thought he only accepts bitcoin as payment and doesnt use fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:06:16
Are you purposely being short sites?  Look at the adoption of gold or any other safe asset, how did they start out?  
Edit:  oh sorry, I miss understood!  I was referring to the 2008 crash and the white papers for bitcoin that then came out in 09.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:58:08
Incredible, you know better than smart money!  That makes you smarter than smart money?  Smarter than andreas antonopoulos,  than the hedge fund managers and the computer scientists, wow you're so smart you should create something amazing!  Best of luck!

A safe deflationary store pf value is a part of the technology isn't it?  It came about after the financial mess after all.

Congratulations,  you're an idiot.

So that's why china can't fees it's own people...oh wait...

To the writers defense you guys seem to miss the point entirely. He is right if someone had put money in to bitcoin as they were moving and plan to take it out the next few days or what have you they could have lost half their value in a matter of days and he's criticizing the use of it as money right now because it's so volatile and unstable.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:32:40
So when people could leave their savings in their bank account the world was in chaos and we are that much better off now with the debt we have and the things we consume?
I mean well before banks gave less than half a percent return.

If the miners are a centralized point of attack then either they have mass control over bch or the government can shut them down wherever they operate which brings Bch down.  The whole premise of Bitcoin was to avoid such centralization, read the white paper ;-)

If more money is printed to bail them out would that drive the price of bitcoin higher by inflating the dollar further?  In a hypothetical crash, would that in effect force more people into gold or bitcoin?   Sorry I'm a newb to this just asking if there is a silver lining?

It does not make it easier.  To the contrary,  if u catch a drug deal with cash you bust that one deal and maybe whats in his home.  If you catch it with bitcoin you potentially have a tracible ledger that is immutable, Gates clearly doesn't know what he's talking about.
