I guess I had only last looked at it when it was near 120 and then just now when it was near 114. I figured it had been dropping fast cause I hadn't been away for more than an hour.

Dwolla is Delaware based, that's the problem. Mtgox needs a money mover outside of the states.

Except the PayPal part. That company is known to suspend funds at a whim and then take weeks to sort out the details.

Some people think  that if they can't change btc to fiat easily then btc is worthless. So they are selling and trying to cut their losses, as they think btc is going to crash for good. Then when the price dropped a little, it confirmed this fear and others jumped onboard. The price spike will come in a week or so when all the people who sold are panicking to get their money out and they realize they may not be able to do it without using BTC, though for now I think only adding money to an account is prohibited.

I see, so this could affect more than dwolla and be even a bigger detriment to the usability of BTC.

It may be a lie but the thread was educational as a whole.

I'd just like to point out that even if you buy into BTC or LTC today then you'll still be an early adopter in a currency that will likely only increase in value over the coming decades.

At this rate it will take 27.62 weeks to break even on each 1BTC investment. That is much more impressive than the 2-3 years I was reading about with other dividend amounts. If they can keep this up then asicmining shares could indeed be a wise investment decision.

Do you use any BTC gambling services? Several, but not all, of the stolen funds cases I've seen have had that sort of thing in common.  It seems like you just stored funds on MTgox so I can't imagine where someone would have been able to pick you out as a target. Maybe it was someone from girlsgonebitcoin (doubt it)? Most likely it was a random attack....it does make me nervous however.

I agree, when you first make an account they should run users through a tutorial of sorts covering the importance of 2fa and yubikey.

It's not like fiat is backed by anything these days. It used to be that a dollar was worth a certain amount of gold which is where it's value came from but now it too is as good as Monopoly money. The biggest difference is that the USD is widely adopted and its value is protected by a very powerful and aggressive government,

I like how the absolute lowest estimate on this site has 1BTC priced just under $800,000 by 2025.
Oh never mind, my iPad was acting up. I can't even reproduce the number I saw.
Actual lowest is about $7.5k

Would not saving passwords in the browser's auto fill avoid this problem?

The originals were supposedly too hard to make and they might have been losing money on dud units. I heard that they raised the price to cover their losses and lowered the specs to match their true manufacturing capability.

You can exchange gold and silver for money too.

They could be if the account is seized. But for now I think they only have stopped transfers into the accounts and not out of. Also it is only through Dwolla, so you could just wire it in or out if you needed. Lastly I'm sure another company can step up and provide a similar service as Dwolla, if I'm not mistaken I think there are a few who already do.

I imagine it will become widely adopted by the global populace in the next decade but it probably won't be officially supported by most governments for a good while. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:21:04
There are several markets but I think they use MtGox.

You just have to keep reloading. Sometimes it also shows yubikey twice, at least on some mobile platforms. Adding authentication seems to fix the problem though.

Will someone please get this person's kind act some attention on r/bestof?
 If I wasn't confined to alien blue then I'd do it myself.

Yeah probably. But I'm betting that is why he said no on the contract, he probably thinks of BTC as a commodity.
