I don't think the 'it was obtained illegally' line of reasoning is very convincing, because there are too many counterexamples to point to--e.g., most leaks about the federal government. The reason for blocking the leaks should be the (potentially) personally identifying information.

I upvoted you both because it's difficult enough to get critical thinking about bitcoin on this sub anymore.

Got a link to back that claim up?

Basically if you are a node on the bitcoin network it's possible to take a transaction that just happened and try to append additional transactions to it that are invalid. The rest of the network shouldn't accept those other transactions as valid, but apparently Mt Gox did in the name of speediness. That's what they're blaming their troubles on, at least. 
(someone correct me if I'm wrong, I'm by no means an expert)

Doge has value because people just give it away--generosity is an intrinsic part of the community.
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:16:12


wow such condescending
It may be propaganda, but they have a point. Dogecoin is more approachable and fun, thus bringing in a larger demographic.

So sorry to hear about the landslide, here's a bit of help from a Seattleite.

I know that The Vera Project ( has done video game themed concerts, there was one last summer. There are other places too, but that one springs to mind.
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:48:33
I think I see your point, by analogy with gold--if it was free to mine gold from the ground in unlimited supply, them it would be basically worthless, right? But it would be a mistake to assume that everything as costly to mine as gold would be worth as much. The value we place in it is for other reasons.
@_date: 2013-09-02 16:52:56
So that would mean that if we start hitting the cap for blocks regularly, transactions without high enough fees will take a while to process, since blocks have a maximum number of transactions and there are a fixed number of blocks. What is the cap?

localbitcoins lets you buy in cash in person; I've never tried it but it's been around for a while. Coinbase is very well built and generally trusted, though you'll have to verify yourself in a bunch of ways, it's similar to paypal. I'd definitely start with coinbase first. Do note that the first bitcoin you buy will take a week or two to get to you before you've become verified.

Using the same logic, why would anyone buy a new computer when it'll be worth half as much in a year? Because you want a new damn computer.

Do you have a specific example you were thinking of? Not saying it hasn't happened, just curious if you were thinking of something else specifically.

If only grandma had invested in bitcoins like we told her, she'd still be able to afford food.

I think (though I could be wrong) that forks aren't only when there is a branch in the bitcoin blockchain, but also when the bitcoin software and blockchain is copied wholesale. Which would mean two bitcoin networks, and two places you can spend your coins now that they have doubled. I think that's the one is talking about. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:06:30
[The fork]( that happened in March forced miners (nodes) to choose between two conflicting ledgers. So the blockchain branched, and the network has to choose which branch is correct. 
If you set up some nodes to collectively decide on the *other* branch, even just a few, then you'd have yourself a (technically) successful fork, since people can now double spend their coins on both branches. So coins are doubled, if anybody bothered to use your network. The rest of the network would ignore you, but if you're facebook then maybe not. Still, why would any company want to fork the chain like this when they can create their own cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:34:21
Yeah, I don't think it's possible without changing the software somehow. Though I'd be surprised if a 51% attack could be pulled off without changing some code, too. But really, who cares even if someone does do this? This definitely wouldn't affect the rest of the network.
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:04:05
If you dig a hole, does that mean the hole has value? Not necessarily (it depends on the hole). Just because it takes work to make something doesn't necessarily give it value. The work that is done to mine bitcoins is a system set up to ensure that double-spending does not happen, to verify that users transferring bitcoins actually possess them, etc. 
Bitcoins have value because they are useful as money. Of course, massive speculation doesn't hurt either, nor does the fact that they are limited. But if bitcoin succeeds and gains real, mainstream traction, it'll be because it's more useful than other money services that currently exist.
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:20:03
Seems easier to just launch their own cryptocurrency at that point. At least then they don't have to deal with everyone who owns bitcoins now also owning them in the new facecoin ledger.
@_date: 2013-09-02 22:44:50
That's a great point, the bitcoin protocol is robust and can be adapted. So I guess the thinking is that this will almost certainly happen if (and, for some, when) bitcoin usage goes up by a few factors of ten. If that happens fast, we'll start to see more dedicated drives for the block chain. I wonder if it's even possible that block chain size growth outpaces Moore's law as it applies to memory? Because that could be bad.
@_date: 2013-09-02 03:46:26
What if the number of bitcoin transactions goes up drastically? That would mean the block chain would get larger at a much faster rate, right?

true, gold would not be worthless if we stopped using it as a store of value and its price only reflected its use as a commodity. but, the value would be much lower, maybe more like copper. gold's primary value comes from its use as a monetary exchange. so, similar, not identical.
also, you seem to be implying that bitcoins do not have scarcity...
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:53:23
at this rate, it won't take more than 3 more years for that to be a thing.

Haven't we had this for years, what with SSL and encrypted centralized buying / sellling online? This also describes PayPal, it's not exactly screaming Bitcoin.

So basically in your view, there is no good that could have come from this hearing because it is all a charade anyway. Great, good to know.

absolutely nothing, just like gold. gold has value primarily because we think it does.

I'd have to disagree. While the ipod, iphone, and (I think) ipad weren't the first of their kind, they were so vastly different than what had come before. It's The Apple Experience^TM. Remember when the iphone came out? People waited 20 hours in line for that shit. Part of that is their walled garden approach to apps, which is obviously not working out too great for bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:20:34
That's not what gives bitcoin its value, though.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:16:42
If it did happen, the entirety of the US supply of money as of 2012 could purchase ~10 mBTC.

Not necessarily. They're still nipping it in the bud, without suddenly declaring a bunch of assets to suddenly be worthless. Also leaving the door open for a more state-sanctioned approach in the future.
