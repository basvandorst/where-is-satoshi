Indeed, now it is working as the way your precised it, however it as not what I experienced at the time I posted my comment. 
Anyway, thx.

I would say because it is more than a current human life. And because it represents 3 generations (consider ~30y per generation).

Being European but getting paid in Chinese yuan (CNY), it's getting crazy. 4-5 years ago it was 1€ = 10-11¥ and now it is 1€ for 7.3¥. In my case for the same amount of CNY I receive 25℅ more euro after conversion than 4-5 years ago. Not very useful for now, but might be someday. 
However, IMHO, it will not continue to increase in such way otherwise China will not be competitive anymore in term of commerce (which already starts to be the case). I think that in the coming months, the conversion rate €-¥ will come back on a more "normal" rate. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-02-20 15:25:05
"None of these", probably include Bitcoin.

I'm using coinbase too. It takes 4 to 5 business days to load your wallet with fiat, but purchasing Bitcoin with it should only take few seconds.
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:53:10
So not 1 BTC ;)
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:41:16
agreed, this is what I would recommand, (TREZOR or other equivalent hardware wallet).

Thank you for this. :D :D
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:33:02
I would recommand to transfer regularly a fix amount of fiat in order to "always" have some already loaded into your fiat wallet. When you think it is a good moment to buy (price you are ready to pay for), simply proceed to the order.
If you want to avoid the swings, you can split the purchase to get a better average. For example, if you transfer 200 USD, you can purchase BTC once a week for 4 weeks for an equivalent of 50 USD. Sometime you will get a bit more BTC sometime a bit less.

How can mass people trust Bitcoin, when only 20k BTC can swing the price that much?
They must think, if 20k can do that, what can do 50k, 150k, 250k to my Bitcoin value.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:01:45
Just purchase some 3 days ago at $250... :(
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:07:27
Yes, probably won't have to wait that much time (it is already on the upward path). However it's pitty that I didn't not wait few more hours.... I would have been able to enjoy those even-cheaper coins. For the same amount of USD spent I would have get extra 0.35BTC.

News talking about bitcoin will certainly help the adoption, but it will be done smoothly, months after months, years after years. IMHO this is why it does not create spikes (or at least less important one).
More media are talking about it, educating people, less chances there is to see a spike. It will be a gradual and constant (overall) raise following adoption.
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:29:38

@_date: 2015-03-10 02:24:41
Pretty low, indeed 1 in 4.29 billion. However with the number of wallets increasing this probability is surely increasing as well.
I read on another thread that there is currently an estimated total of ~55 Milions bitcoin addresses; which is not that much, but with HD wallets, and the gain of popularity of bitcoin, this number will grow fast, increasing the chance of mistyping a valid address.
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:05:06
The thing is that most of Chinese people even don't know what is a VPN and dont really know there is internet website being blocked. (But it is changing slowly).

I confirmed, being in china, there is not a lot of things you can do so far with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-21 03:18:46
Withdrawal is working. This is the first thing I tested, once I reached the 1200 satochi limit. However, for the last 5 days I'm using it, I didn't do any additional withdraw. But it should still be working.
@_date: 2015-03-06 03:44:32
Was it not because of Willy? I think media coverage has not a lot to do with it. They just relay the information, and maybe it impacted the price a little,... but as you noticed, today bitcoin is all over mainstream news, and price stays "relatively" stable.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:14:15
so starting any minute soon, now :)
A link will be posted, or the interview notes will be posted here?

It worth answering the survey; so now I'm waiting to see the final report.

@_date: 2015-02-05 13:30:49
Nope, but it brings new people to the bitcoin community (so potentially increase a bit the demand). It will help, not only by spreading the word out, but actually to be in possession of bitcoin. From the neophyte point of view, I guess it can seem difficult to buy bitcoin online (registration; account verifications; money transfer...). 
By exchanging bitcoin a correct / current price, directly from person to person, it can definitely help help its propagation over new / scared people.

@_date: 2015-02-21 03:04:43
Using it.... So far so good. But in my opinion this is a scam based on ponzi scheme. 
Especially when you see that by investing 1BTC you can have much more in return. So far i m using it as a faucet, and don't plan to deposit any BTC. Gain will be lower, but risk to be scammed is also greatly lower.
I don't know what is the registration number, but I saw ~8000 when I started.... (Can't recall where I saw this number tho).
