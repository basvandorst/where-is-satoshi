When the fact of your parking confirmed millions of computers around the world, with the help of "smart contracts" between the parking and purse on your iPhone will be notified and will be given a choice: pay now or pay and receive a fine. To add this function to existing systems do not need to create a centralized management of parking lots, and do not need government regulation. All can work within the framework of existing laws, even in the Russian Federation ", - said Ivan Barinov.

During Bitcoin Conference Russia, which is now in Moscow, learned some details about the ban Cryptocurrency in Russia. Most likely, the bill will be in August this year.
In addition, the managing partner of the law firm "pusher and Partners" Artem Tolkachov demonstrated preliminary amount of penalties for the use, distribution, and creation of Cryptocurrency (money substitutes) in Russia.
Bitcoins per revolution or other Cryptocurrency for individuals provides for a fine of 5 to 20 thousand rubles. Legal entities will be fined in the amount of 500 thousand to 1 million rubles. Tolkachev also said that individuals should not be something to fear because "test purchases will not." But companies that want to work with Cryptocurrency, Tolkachev recommended "to leave the Russian jurisdiction."
Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia holds a softer view than his fellow officers, and believes that prohibit Cryptocurrency do not need, but bitcoin need competent regulation.
We also learned that the government will provide Roskomnadzor all the powers to make the information resources in the register of banned sites out of court, a spokesman Staff "Pirate Party of Russia" Artem Kozlyuk. It should be noted that this provision of the law conflicts with constitutional norms of Russia.
A bill to ban money substitutes (such as Bitcoin) will be adopted in August 2015. Meanwhile Bitcoin Conference Russia continues, but the editors ForkLog is a live broadcast from the event.

The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation plans to take all necessary measures for the introduction of penalties for the use of Cryptocurrency in the country.
This was recently said Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev. Recently, the situation around Bitcoin in Russia has deteriorated significantly, and if earlier statements by the authorities were more warning character, but now it turned quite differently.
POLICE WILL NOT objectionable tosses a bag with drugs, and flash cards with Bitcoin wallets
Especially for Forklog situation commented Artem Kozlyuk, one of the founders of the movement against censorship on the Internet:
"I suppose that this law, like all previous ones, aimed at state regulation of the network and interact in it will work in manual mode. I do not think that the CBR or some other agency will be downright spud Internet in search of those who use Cryptocurrency. But this law can touch the specific persons who have been instructed to "Bite!". That is introduced another virtual hatchet, which can fall on the head of anyone, but I do not think that all at the same time. "
It is likely that this law be limited to a point of law enforcement, and in conditions of Russian reality unscrupulous police will not objectionable toss a bag of drugs, and the stick-with Bitcoin wallet.
However, because of the specific technology Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency users in Russia will not disappear. And promising, albeit informal, the Russian market will get Western companies. A similar situation arose in connection with retaliatory sanctions from Russia to the Western countries: import substitution appeared a distant dream, but the lion's share of the liberated market is gradually coming under the influence of China. For example, the company recently Alibaba began working in Russia as a result of what to expect mass replacement of European goods to the Chinese, with complete lack of competitiveness of Russian products.
"The law on surrogate currencies put an end to the final desired different kinds of companies to accept Cryptocurrency. While this is just an undesirable factor, and after leading law already may suffer for them and direct punishment "- said Artem Kozlyuk.
States perceive this as a threat to its existence
Judging by the news of this year, a similar outcome for Bitcoins in Russia was obvious. One gets the impression that the Russian authorities are very consistent and warn of their intentions in advance. Since the beginning of this year there was a blokirovaka bitcoin resources, and some time later the deputy from the Liberal Democratic Party, which is implicitly considered the mouthpiece of the ruling party, said that bitcoin - a CIA plot against Russia.
"Yes, it's another step to regress and repressive measures on the web. This artificial inhibition of the progress of knowledge and active network of human interaction in different forms. State perceives this as a threat to its existence. That it is impossible to control and understand the official in his head - to forbid! "
