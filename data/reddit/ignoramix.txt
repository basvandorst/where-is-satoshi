I apologise on his behalf, we so sorry support 2x and spam the network, promise not to do it again, please forgive oh venerable BTC supporters
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:28:38
I think the latter. Spinning facts to fulfill wishes is scammy..

If bcash is 99&amp; bitcoin, then is it bitcoin too? i'm confused.  
Oh and if someone knows why this site 'you are doing that too much' make me wait like 5 min to submit post

Is there like a bitcoin laxative that eases congestion? Seems to me that could solve having to fiddle with fee settings all the time, really don't want to do that
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:36:26
Like for what? I thought it was mostly demo stores, hats and stickers
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:06:02
What's with the font dude
@_date: 2018-06-19 12:22:18
Just doing my part, every body be happy
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:00:20
Thanks, checked it out, they are using Stripe for payments. They abandoned Bitcoin earlier in the year, and now support credit cards only

How does interest rate manipulation become USD manipulation. Nice story bro..

Venezualans very lucky to be able to buy bitcoin, even if at 20K!  I would sell to them if I could
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:04:35
Can you provide some facts?
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:01:31
If a crypto is more transferablebe than BTC, e.g. more reliable confirm times for micro or large transactions, does that make it more perfect?
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:00:07
Thanks, I'll check out your links, looks interesting.  While time is subectively relative and elastic when subject to gravitational force, I will depart with the cheery thought - in the long term, we're all dead. Hope lightning delivers before then
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:32:51
So volume is low, what happens if volume picks up, or a large exchange decides to consolidate all their inputs?
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:36:26
I don't know, lightning looks great but it's a really loong time to get easy to use 
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:59:22
Yup, to the moon! 100k 2018!! Or I'll eat my dick
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:54:53
You make it sound like 6 months to Xmas (lightning) is longer than 6 months from launch. LoL 6 months is always 6 months
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:29:40
You know been hearing that all the way from 18K...
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:26:42
Wow core really saved all our asses and bitcoin!!
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:41:53
Make it a core technical lecture, teach those  kids something
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:25:39
Maybe BTC isn't the best choice for merchant transaction anyways. Lightning or bitcoin cash, whatever works best for you.  Then the address issue, what ever that is, if it exists, no explanation.. is solved
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:47:22
This is the SEC. Will you whiny $itches $ucking shut up. Nobody cares about what you want or your stinky shitcoin

@_date: 2018-07-11 16:48:18
With don't do evil Google selling out, and Edge Bing 2.0, that only leaves leaves Firefox and Brave, so a lot of room for new browsers. Native wallet integration a big plus, as long as not BTC only, as user want good, reliable shopping experience.  It's going to get interesting
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:27:22
LoL what a bunch of crock
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:27:08
Well he did drop his LTC bags on unsuspecting public. Is he pumping bitcoin for a repeat? talking about bitcoin core or cash?
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:27:49
Gold and bitcoin volatility very different, so not gold 2.0.  Besides why compare to something lesser unless unsure of the value proposition
