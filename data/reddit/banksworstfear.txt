@_date: 2014-08-28 01:27:46
great points. But I don't think people will reject free stuff here; especially after all the media attention and hype.
They will learn bitcoin. This will be a big step.

Create a video distribution website that does accept bitcoin and compete with them.
That will make them act faster.
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:30:26
next year they'll look at it completely different.
How can you tell when they're activated?
@_date: 2014-08-28 10:29:46
Its like letting someone use a new product. It helps promotion, name recognition and jumpstarts use. It's perfect for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:03:03

See the other 30 bitcoin conferences happening this year alone:
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:18:34
It could mean MORE. It's more likely they process payments worth more than their company.
For example visa is worth 131 billion market cap but transfers $3.5 Trillion in funds per year.
If we apply the same ratio to global payment network...they transfer $120 billion per year......that would be incredibly huge for bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:39:50
That doesn't make sense

@_date: 2014-08-06 20:06:43
from the company direct?
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:35:20
To advance bitcoin worldwide propagation. To test what would happen if a closeknit chunk of people could start transacting in bitcoin.
And think about a company that makes a product. People don't trust your product until real people test; to make that faster you give away 100 of them. Same kind of notion/benefit here.
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:22:55
Thanks for tip; will let them know
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:50:20
Okay, use google and amazon as comparison. Burgeoning new companies in a new sector that's untrusted. Housing sector WAS trusted by more everyday folks and look where that got 'em.

@_date: 2014-08-28 01:26:20
I assume they provide the education materials like they say first, people who want to learn learn, and everyone gets a message with the bitcoins. They reply to claim them. This will go MUCH better than the Auroracoin airdrop

Well it could be just a third party wallet or service that integrates transactions between bitcoin and an altcoin. An altcoin that's faster and with an improved blockchain; better for micro trans

why do they re-sent older coins first? jus becuz code was made that way?
@_date: 2014-08-30 01:16:28
Its the best scenario. If the island was smaller population people would be mor critical of the operation
if it was too big it would be less realistic
We're matching donations up to $1,000 donate here:
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:39:46
OH; u think people will buy coins to donate to the island?
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:20:37
lol where does that take place?
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:52:40
"the agency noted that the currencies are not backed by the government"
OH! glad they cleared that up...Yeah I knew already. But those thousands of people who think government issues bitcoins, they need to know! And I'm sure 'The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau' sent them a memo in the mail to make sure they know! or emergency broadcast on TV. That should penetrate abou 30% of people right away and the rest by word of mouth...

Coinapult is the oldest:
@_date: 2014-08-07 02:24:18
Exchanges are heavily regulated. My point is that this is doing the same as an exchange so its subject to the same laws hence not likely anyones going to do this specific service; should convince coinbase to do it

@_date: 2014-07-04 00:13:57
Oh, yes! It's like bitcoin except that you still have to deal with corporate megabanks, overdraft risks, loss of privacy, capital controls, other fees, risk of government confiscation if you're not a 'good citizen' and maybe even more!

@_date: 2014-07-06 02:37:48
Well an altcoin could provide the solution, couldn't it? The problem is really blockchain bulkiness. But it would be another thing for bitcoin to integrate; it's so far along its harder to make big changes.
