Chinese miners are seeking consensus. Do you agree with their attitude?
@_date: 2015-06-03 09:03:30
Hi vnkvci, we sent you the award. Please check. :)
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:51:51
I guess she must be attracted by your personal charm rather than Bitcoin. lol
@_date: 2015-06-25 09:52:37
That's why Huobi is calling for consensus together with other mining pools instead of making a change. It is actually important to express their views to the Core developers and get the feedback.Discussion is a good thing in many ways.
@_date: 2015-06-25 03:39:58
Great summary!
One more disadvantage: fee is relatively high to most users.

New York state's BitLicense has forced several companies to run their business “secretly”. Some even say that BitLicense is actually dangerous to consumers. What do you think of it? Do you believe in such thing as BitLicense?

Hi allinfinite, we sent you the award. Please check. :)

Haha... Maybe she is not the type of tech girl. :P
@_date: 2015-06-25 02:09:03
What about the fee? Do you think it's reasonable considering the transaction service and fiat to BTC then bact to fiat exchanges?
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:10:26
Wow. When and where did you buy it? I'm curious about how did you convince the merchant to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:34:42

Wow, so they are saving Bitcoins and USD instead of trading and paying? Impressive!
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:06:31
OK. Just had a look at it and quite doubt the satistics on it. It appears Asia has a few Bitcoins but apparently it's not the fact. If Arnhem really likes what the map shows, then Netherlands is definitely a strong Bitcoin market.
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:32:17
Hi coincrazyy, haha. Great explanation! Bitcoin somehow likes Internet. So it may goes the same way as Internet once have. Born in Silicon, thrive there and spread to the world from there!
@_date: 2015-05-26 10:29:20
Whoops. How are your friends now? Do they still believe Bitcoin will have a great future?
@_date: 2015-05-27 06:55:33
I see. Then you can restore some and wait until it worth a house. :D
@_date: 2015-05-27 03:58:41
Are your two best friends BTCer now? Bitcoin is still known by a minority of people all over the world now. The majority always begin to accept things when they are maturely developed,such as internet and e-commence. But success always belongs to those who have a long-term financial perspective.
@_date: 2015-05-27 03:47:41
I agree with you. The market now is better than the last half year of 2014. So it may be the best timing to invest.
@_date: 2015-05-11 11:28:13
What draws your attention to BTC for the 1st time?
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:07:59
Sorry and thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:26:18
Hi johnblanco, you're right! Strict goverment control will definitely push people to embrace Bitcoin. So what's the situation of current Bitcoin market in Argentina? Can you share more in details?
@_date: 2015-05-27 03:43:15
Do you think it's the best timing to recommend friends to use Bitcoin? Now the price is enough low and it has waited so long to burst out its potential.

In a positive sign for financial technology startups, a government inquiry has set the stage for the digital currency Bitcoin to be treated like a "national or foreign currency" in Australia.
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:51:22
We're building it up to break it back down. Is that what you mean?
@_date: 2015-08-19 04:01:57
Good point. Do you think studying digital currency would be narrow, but doing MS in Computer Science will give you more choices in the future?
@_date: 2015-08-24 06:54:29

@_date: 2015-09-15 07:35:06
Yes, then the bitcoin could be a solution for avoiding situations like that. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 07:12:17
but how much do you think that it could change the way the blockchain and bitcoin work?
@_date: 2015-11-11 06:48:51

@_date: 2015-11-10 07:33:21
I think always there is a reason
@_date: 2015-10-28 07:07:05
