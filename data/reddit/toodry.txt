A public ledger with transactions that don't require an identity attached. Cryptocurrency is by far one of the easiest ways to anonymously store and launder money. Accumulate large amount of bitcoin by buying in cash, I currently see people accepting up to £200,000 per transaction on Localbitcoins live right now and there are many more people offering similar anonymous services in cities around the world. From there you can either mix the coins, or buy alternative more anonymous cryptocurrency such as Dash (or DarkCoin as it used to be known that mixes coins with every transaction) then purchase stuff with that or just sit on the btc and sell it for cash when needed.
Note: I do not condone money laundering or tax avoidance and do not hold dash, I just think its naive to believe that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aren't very viable options for this.

Indeed, the government services it's debt through government bonds. Austerity attempts to reduce this public debt by cutting costs, thus reducing the amount of money in the private economy. However in order to ensure growth in the economy during this time usually requires an increase in private debt. [With the private debt to GDP rate rising rapidly from 2000-2008 in the UK and the Eurozone, giving rise to the boom in the economy at that time, and then in the years after the crash remaining stagnant as central banks introduced historically low interest rates in order to force growth and combat the crash.](  We can expect to see many problems arise in the near future as the level of private debt starts to rise again due to austerity and the inevitable rise of interest rates will only lead to many of these debts being defaulted upon leading to the burst of the debt bubble and a new crash.

I fell for it, wouldn't put it past the US govt to legislate such a ridiculous law.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:26:25
US federal law surrounding UIGEA, seems to be quite loose in order to account for indiviaual states highlighy amlipfied fears of consumer inawareness of the mathematical result of gamling against a house with 50%+ edge (a certain loss over a infinte time period) and to protect those who wish to be ignorant to that math.
I say despite my upmost misgivings, so as to create a 'fair and equal society', that it is against evolution and wrong for an outside indivual to enforce this law, as this restricts the likehood that individuals will learn about said mathematics and thus infilcts them to more indiret manipulation, thus it is neccesary to highly educate and encourage the individual to understand the intricacies of financial gambling and market mathematics.
As to the problem of the US and its attempted influence of power over other country's companies laws. I completely agree no company wants to fuck with the USA and its crazy laws so most poker sites wont actively participate in trying to obtain customers from there as long as these loose, intricate and longly surmountable federal and state regulations exist.

The main benefit to users if poker sites started accepting bitcoins is for those who wish to take advantage of the system not those who actually want to play poker. Anon payments allow for large scale [Sybil Attacks]( and of course the usual botting with less repurcussion (not that there is much, if any repurcussion for botters already on most large sites). 
Which is why you should only play the freerolls at [Seals with Clubs]( the large games are likely full with colluding bots.
If pokerstars or similar did start accepting bitcoin I don't think that the price would increase like you said, although Gambling is indeed a large factor in crypto currency price. As shown by the recent bubble in [Clam Coins]( that is due to the site [Just Dice]( previously one of the most popular bitcoin and other crypto dice sites (second highest on google search for 'bitcoin dice' after satoshi dice) recently re-opening only accepting currency in the form of CLAMS. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:28:22
Very true, am sorry I'm from the UK where almost all gambling is openly permitted, forgot that some of you yanks can't play poker legally.
Your right this is a major use case for bitcoin, in bypassing presumed consumer ignorance in regulatory laws. All the money is volume into bitcoin whether it be controlled by a botnet for profit or an individual, but for this very reason I see it unlikely that bitcoin will be introduced into many top poker sites that wish to attain a credible, supposebly 'cheat free' reputation, unless of course they introduce some form of direct consumer identification such as social security number.

I have since come to the conclusion that it is unlikely that Nash wrote the bitcoin code and white paper by himself due to his age, listening to his recent lectures today he outlines sound economic principles that the idea of bitcoin is based on yet he fails to show much of a sign of technical knowledge. It is probable that he never actively participated in its wiriting at all. It is more likely that Satoshi was a keen proponent of Nash's theories on sound money which leads me to the names Nick Sazbo and Wei Dai, that almost certainly have/had alot of contact with Satoshi if not more likely are more pseudonyms of the person or persons who created bitcoin.
Of course trying to figure out the identity of an expert cryptographer is like trying to fight a WBA boxing champ so I doubt this mystery will be solved easily.
Satoshi's satoshin email was supposedly hacked recently:
Seems like a dud though, is very unlikely that they would still be using the account.

To a measly 1.7mb if everyone uses it. It is not a long term on chain scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:50:41




No, absolutely not. There are more factors at play than a 50.1% vote this is not a double spend attack, this is consensus formation across the network to improve its scalability. If that occurs through vast node signalization &amp; important user acceptance then the miners will reflect that. This is a strong vote requiring acceptance from many parties; Exchanges, merchants, users and then miners (the very people who invest many millions into maintaining the network and almost solely profit from its increase in value) this is not an attack, we all want what is better for bitcoin, so why not signal for it?


If there is a hard fork it should have much greater support from users, merchants and exchanges and thus much greater hash power as it will be the more valuable network there may be others but they will either pump and dump or be crushed by a 51% merge mine double spend attack i.e an 'evil hard fork'.


This is the protocol. This is strength through consensus. Stop trying to hijack the protocol through soft fork to segwit and thus lightning, which will not solve the long term block size problem and will inevitably force much of the transactions that could easily scale on the bitcoin network, through the centralized lightning network. 
If we should hard fork the cap that was put in as an after thought to stop spam by Satoshi years ago and induct upon a hard fork that has occurred twice before in 2010 and the v0.7 incident in 2013, where the whole network quickly and easily achieved consensus. Then we should do it now before the stakes become too high and the powers that be try to control and limit this network to abuse it with off chain, centralized transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:33:47
Or accept that it would be much better for bitcoin to scale on chain first. 
I support segwit but it will never achieve the 95% necessary until the 1mb limit is removed for fear that the majority of transactions and thus the value of the network will be pushed off chain through centralized hubs.
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:37:08
One where all important nodes have transitioned over to the new software; all large exchanges, merchants and users once the large majority of them have signaled that they will relay larger blocks then the miners will start to mine larger blocks. As long as a large majority of users and important nodes agree to the increase then when the miner creates the first large block there will not be a problem.
As long as there is a vast enough majority of important users on the new chain there is no incentive to stay on the old chain.
Edit: I don't see it as reckless to encourage people to say they would be up for a bigger block size. Larger blocks wont be mined until it is safe to do so, there is great financial incentive for the miners not to.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:18:54

LN is not a centralized system itself as closing one LN would not endanger the network but from the node operator point of view some payment/money transfer are centralized through the node and that might come with consequences ie. more Regulation/KYC etc. decreasing fungibility.

I would happily debate the virtues of different digital currencies with you. However you seem to have reverted immediately to ad hominem attacks upon my character when you don't even know who I am. 
If your point was "Ethereum does not have a highly liquid ETH to USD" market then I would have agreed with you that is a drawback and sign of its immaturity. However you said it takes $30 to move the price 10%. This is provably incorrect.

Thanks, kudos to Cryptoconomy for taking the time to reply with clear and concise arguments. I will admit that I am not an expert in this very heated and complex debate.
Edit: Regardless of lightning I still think that if consensus can be formed the blocksize limit should definitely be raised.
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:53:28
No after the hard fork you will have the same amount of coins on both blockchains. However chances are that due to the block difficulty retargeting that takes place only every 2016 blocks the core chain with its distinct lack of hashing power is going to be taking along time to find blocks until they retarget. Transactions will take ages to confirm and value will transfer to the new unlimited chain.

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:52:45
The number of blocks mined is the product of price x difficulty. Thus because of EDA, BCH was extremely profitable to mine in short bursts. Now it is based on a trailing average it is profitable to mine to the proportion of its price vs other SHA-256 currencies. Currencies such as BTC might I add, that have a lot higher fees.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:42:15
No. Just no. After the next block is mined on BCH the algorithm will change to a trailing average difficulty of the last 144 blocks. Watch  as over the next 24 hours an amount of mining power equatable to the price of BCH goes back to mining it as the difficulty retargets. Also watch BTC's fees and mempool increase as it loses this hash power, be prepared for a long wait for transactions and sky high fees because the difficulty wont re-target for another 1500 blocks.
