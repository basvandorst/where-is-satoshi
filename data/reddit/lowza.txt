Not everyone needs to run a full node so that's not an issue.
How is btc going to have an impact on the lives of people living there when they cant afford the fees?

Doesn't need it.  32MB blocks equates to blockchain growth of 1642.5 GB per year, assuming every single block is completely full. There are 2TB HDDs on Amazon for $60. 4TB for less than $100. This cost will only decrease as time goes on. 
Adoption of merchants for btc has stopped, meanwhile 74 new merchants added to marco coino app in this last week alone a 5% increase, because it works just like btc did before the blocks filled.
What is btc being developed to be out of interest?

And if you say otherwise on this sub you get down voted or even banned. All we want is a currency that works well and is cheap to send. Currently raising the block size is the simplest solution to full blocks and would allow bitcoin to grow. "Bcash users" simply follow logic.

The point of bitcoin is to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. What has censorship got to do with this? 


No, it's quite cheap to run a full node and storage space will get cheaper and cheaper as time goes on.


It's needed right now, there's a reason merchant adoption has pretty much stopped on BTC, and many are now switching over to BCH because it works like BTC did before the blocks got filled.


BCH is cheap because the blocks are not full and this is intended. If the blocks ever fill up, the blocksize can be raised again. As far as I understand, miners will be rewarded from huge amounts of smaller fees, rather than small amounts of large fees. Price increases will also help with this as adoption increases. If the rewards are still too low then hash rate will drop which does make the network more vulnerable, but is not something i'm worried about.


Wasn't the chain rolled back not so long ago?  
If I were you I would be insanely cautious about storing any kind of value on such a unsecured blockchain. 
BCH has been attacked multiple times and has survived, again i'm not worried about this.


BCH is fast because the blocks are not full. If BCH is centralised then so is BTC, they operate on very similar models. People do use BCH and are itching to spend it. Merchant adoption is a slow process but is happening and once again BCH is cheap because the blocks are not full.

Not everyone in Africa has 1mb internet speeds they have fibre there too you know.
There are around 2000 billionaires in the world
There are about 16 million millionaires in the world
There are about 45000 stock listed companies in the world
There are about 3 billion middle class people in the world
Im sure whatever the storage cost... there will be plenty of parties that can afford to run a full node and keep the system well more than decentralized enough for it to prosper and be secure...

Indeed, everyone knows it's a store of value now and not a payment system.

If you do some research you will see scaling on chain does work. Can you tell me why it doesn't work?
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:45:32
Such a great store of value!
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:23:26
There are thousands of nodes verifying transactions for everybody. Individual users do not need to run a full node but they do have the option to.
If lightning grows to be big, the large lightning hubs will effectively become the banks of today. We need to scale on chain to keep it decentralised.
Since when did discussing bitcoin become trolling?
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:14:02
Lightning does not work in the real world. Scaling on chain works. Why not both on chain?

What am I making up exactly?

How can it work as a currency when the fees are so much? Bitcoin has tied it's own hands by not increasing the blocksize to allow more transactions on the network.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:21:47
I don't hold any BTC because I won't support something that doesn't work. I have made more than enough from crypto so i'm not angry about that, but I am angry that BTC is no longer going to be usable as peer to peer cash for everyone.
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:34:55
True, but not everyone needs to store the entire blockchain. You will be able to run nodes that only store the latest year of transactions for example. As long as we have multiple records of the entire blockchain stored by trusted parties, the smaller nodes can be verified by them.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:57:55
I used to believe in BTC, unfortunately you can't send a transaction right now without a $2.00 fee so it's unusable as a currency. Lightning is too complicated to ever work. And it's not a great store of value if it loses $3k in a day.

1. Still way too high to pay for a coffee
2. If I wanted to send a friend $1.00, I would pay more than that in fees. That is unusable as a currency
3. Can you tell me the process to send $1.00 to a friend via lightning?
4. It gained it's value from it's use, now that it is not really usable it's value may well go down in the long run.

Why should he accept bitcoin for pizza? I was told here it's just used as a store of value now??? What is your view on this and how can we pay with bitcoin in the long term without high fees?
