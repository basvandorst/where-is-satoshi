Yeah, mining is really hard.

Also, make xPub tracking automatic. I think that xPubs work by repeatedly hashing an address to get the next one. Simply do that in each address and see if a used address results. Di this about 25 times per address for good measure.
Edit: would you like me to code a function for you. I'm bot a good programmer, but I can do a few things.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:58:49
Oh, I'll sell stuff
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:23:18
Nvm. Just shop around for exchanges
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:17:37
Any word on the Ballance.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:34:55
Can you do this? Or can someone do this? Im curious to see if it does something.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:18:55
Coinbase if possible
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:29
There is no way to change the rate, but if you sent as much as there was in your address, you can send the same transaction with a higher fee. That one will get confirmed. Though most software doesn't allow that.
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:49:21
A private key
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:53:31
So I can buy shit I can buy using bitcoin. Duh.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:06:32
Use this item, and you will never have to invest in another cryptocurrency again!!!
Edit: Can someone please post this in r/technicallycorrect for me?

There is a possibility of paired electrons, which may completely disobey the speed of light.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:39:06
Yeah, that was just plain stupid.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:51:09
This is my fear. People bot using cryptocurrency for what it's meant for.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:53:48
Too late
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:32:11
Probably a better idea, but that will not make things consistent accost views, maybe there should be an option to do both.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:38:44
Idk, might as well.
Don't spend it on drugs
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:52:21
A cleaner GUI, and maybe a way to track xPubs.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:10:56
We don't know yet. The universe falls apart when it gets really small; gravity doesn't work with protons and stuff. The same might happen with communication. We haven't tested it with a distance above 11 feet, so we can't know for sure.

Lets have him loose more weight.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:12:08
I prefer bits, better style, and easier on computers die to less float variables
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:27:19
Also, turn transaction ids into 16 digit phonetic strings based on the hash; this will make the GUI cleaner.
This doesn't have to be made as a way to identify all transactions, just the ones you're looking at.
A way to do this: turn the hash into binary. For however many possible syllables, take the fist x bits of the transaction id where 2^x &gt;= the amount of possible syllables. Do this until you have 16 characters. Make sure to only use syllables of a character length that will leave you with the exact amount of characters you need.
I can make an algorithm if you like.
Reply with what you think.

How can they spam? Don't they have to pay a fee?
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:35:20
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:32:02
I thought that blockchain.info provided a view like that, but it's literally just the transaction.

Specifically Bitcoin? I feel like they would be more interested in Ether
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:43:26
Because they can't survive on their own.

Last year
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:53:34
Cant the blockchain handle that?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:05:26
Taxing Bitcoin is impossible. There is no feature for that, and there never will be.
Bitcoin, in the future, will have to be taxed like normal money; where businesses pay sales tax, and everyone reports their earnings and pays taxes that way.

What is S2x
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:58:34
How the fuck do you sens a transaction with no receive address?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:11:29
Yeah, the law just needs to be changed to: "no taxes" except on investments.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:54:11
Oooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... don't put it in the bank.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:48:58
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:51:31
Much like the government only taxes on the gain pf stocks, they would only charge you on the $500
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:55:14
The fact that making 100 $500 gifts does not make it untaxable.
Yes, gifts over $500 are up for taxing.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:10:23
Why the hell would you use a blockchain wallet, but not import it into the wallet and use the xpub? The hacker probably saw the private key lying around somewhere or stored on your computer.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:54:24
I think so. Bitcoin is not classifies as property, but as an investment.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:50:36
Keep your keys safe, then fight back if that happens
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:41:45
It's not. Bitcoin doesn't have a lot of stuff. Like contracts and tokens.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:44:46
Probably coinbase (coinbase.com). They allow for small purchases.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:53:12
Sort of. As long as the key isn't for some reason transmitted. Yes.
The public key is transmitted in most cases, but not the private one.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:49:37
Not use that exchange
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:48:47
Blockchain wallet
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:17:43
They use the price of popular exchanges.

The way a cryptocurrency will become the major currency is through 2 steps:
1: some sellers use services that allow the exchange of cryptocurrency and fiat.
2: the middle man will be cut out when the majority of sellers "accept" cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:07:23
I want there to be no taxes on transaction, but normal taxes like sales tax and income tax.
Nothing stopping the development of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:59:38
Sure. Do so
