It's just a digital copy of government controlled and taxed fiat. Now they get even more information on the purchases of private citizens.
Next, automated taxation.

Yupp. It would be very like China.

I am talking about the exchanges. And yes, for that they can force registered wallet payouts only.

But as you state.. it's China, they will try and it will affect Chinese exchanges and thereby the markets.

This paragraph from Bloomberg does not sound like the old sources. Too much detail.
"The ban will only apply to trading of cryptocurrencies on exchanges, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private. Authorities don’t have plans to stop over-the-counter transactions, the people said. China’s central bank said it couldn’t immediately comment."

Kind of hard if the exchange won't pay out to it....

BTC is not even a drop in the bucket for PBOC, they have better things to do than dabble in FUD. May be market manipulators but don't blame the government. 
I do believe there will be a temporary shutdown, they will launch an official Chinese wallet and require mandatory registration. Then exchanges will reopen. 2 problems fixed, corruption and missing out on tax revenues.

Risk to *their* money laundering

Surely you realize that it would affect liquidity and volume on all official Chinese exchanges and thus the markets we trade in... i couldn't give less of a flying f**** about China itself.
