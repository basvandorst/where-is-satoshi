Sorry about the loss man. Buy from me instead! I've started selling on Ebay and have yet to run into a bad apple, but I'd much rather sell to people that I know aren't going to do charge backs. I have a small group of return customers and get the BTC to you within the hour. If you want to talk about this msg me! I'd love to gain a customer. Also I should note I'm working my up to bigger transactions but right now I don't mess with anything over .1 BTC currently.

So they just made there own private blockchain/network/altcoin and just claimed it's done a transfer? Or did they use an already existing one?

Wow that is really sad, I am so sorry.

Why is this in r/ bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-03 01:38:32
What do you mean by online transfer?
@_date: 2016-01-03 02:53:15
Ah ok. I actually do online transactions with some people. You'd be surprised how many people just want someone to trust that will reliably sell bitcoin online to avoid providing there bank/credit card info. Just normal people that aren't terrorists or money launderers haha.

Yea that was my guess as to why it was posted here but the article doesn't even mention bitcoin at all. Either way though it's still fucked up lol.

Have you personally used Circle.com? I was reading some bad reviews and experiences people have had, but nothing that is recent.. It's all from 2014 mostly. It does seem to be used a lot though. I'm just not sure.

That's just your typical faucet site pretty much. Similar to Bitcoinbonus. If you have nothing better to do just collect from them daily. It's like finding change on the ground.

They didn't use the blockchain that bitcoin or any other altcoin uses. They made their own and traded on their own private blockchain. Not that impressive.

Wow awesome, I'm looking into it right now. Thanks for the response, I didn't even think to check if your company had a Reddit account!
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:01:46
Thanks so much for the recommendation dude. I signed up and like an hour later I'd already purchased some BTC. Super quick and reliable.

Just go get a new ID, lol.

The cool thing about the Ads, is that they are other bitcoin sites. They are extremely useful in building your network of sites that you can earn good chunks of reliable money. Now they all vary in quality but if you spend a couple hours doing research and just doing simple math to see which sites have higher payouts you can maximize the amount of bitcoin you can gather. I started very low but with common sense you can narrow down the sites you use so that you earn more money. It's seriously worth it. I compare it to walking around your town and picking up the change. Once you start paying attention to the change you're picking up you start to find more.

Yea, when you start out a lot of the beginning process is just passing captcha's. Once you start to understand and build your knowledge of bitcoin you start to find better sites to earn more coin. Over the past 3 days I've made about $15 just watching tv and claiming free fractions of bitcoins. It's as easy as just leaving your computer on. Seriously. It's worth noting that I spent absolutely $0 starting this process. It's very secure and you have absolutely nothing to worry about. It's great.

My point is that I made that money from nothing. That was my goal. That's just the first step. I'm not trying to explain what I am personally doing in detail. But dude maybe some kid that plays LoL or WoW all day, they might spend half their day waiting on friends or whatever. But instead they spend that time doing this and they can pay for their own subscriptions. I thought it was really obvious that it's not a replacement for a job by any means.

Google "how bitcoins faucet websites work". Coinbase.com is a website where you can set up a bitcoin (BTC) wallet [It's basically a super secure online wallet] so you can receive payment from these sites. Most sites do require you to earn a curtain amount before you can claim it, but this is far from inconvenient.
