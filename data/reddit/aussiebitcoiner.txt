Yes it is still small. But LN is live on mainnet and growing fast with real purchases being made, and it is under extensive testing on testnet. I would think extensive testing and mainnet activity especially would still be a long way off if not for the recent high fees. High fees have highlighted the scaling issues of the blockchain, resulting in a surge in the development of Lightning and pushing BTC ahead of where it would be otherwise.

My guess is bull, IMO there's too much support and positivity around for us to drop back below $10,000. But that could just be hopeful thinking on my part. Either way things should get exciting within the next 2-3 days, we're running out of space

@_date: 2018-01-11 05:35:35
Because in 1 month, the blockchain would be 7,470 GB big. in 6 months, 44,070 GB big. If you bring it back down to 1 MB after 6 months (after LN for example), that 44,070 GB will still be there, and will still have to be downloaded and stored.

It's a negative side affect but I wouldn't consider it as a problem which needs fixing. One of the key points of bitcoin is that whoever controls the private keys is the only one who can control the bitcoin. The consequence of that is that if that person looses those keys, then there is nothing anyone can do to get them back. Any fix to this consequence would involve removing the private key = sole ownership part of bitcoin.

This post is about letting a company handle your bitcoins and then loosing them. If anything it is another argument against organisations such as banks.

You don't need to invest in it. Drivechains would be a part of bitcoin, and their value would be pegged to bitcoin.

Will Internet download/upload speed and bandwidth get high enough? RAM? storage space? (and affordable for everyone?) Progress in these last 2 in particular seems to be slowing down. Going from a few MB to 1 TB is nearly 6 orders of magnitude, we may have achieved that in the past but it remains to be seen if it can be done in the near future.

If you send the bitcoin into your own wallet, for which only you have the private keys, then you and only you can access them, no organisation or government can get a hold of them or block a transaction. BUT if you keep your bitcoin with a company like Coinbase, you lose this advantage since you no longer have control of the private keys. 
The point is that you can take sole control of your own money, but if for some reason you don’t want the responsibility (or want to be able to trade back and forth) then you can use a company like Coinbase. 
Then there are many more arguments such as stripping away the govenment’s ability to decrease everyone’s net worth by creating money out of thin air with no limit, but I’m too tired.

You can certainly run a node on a remote server, if that is what you were thinking of. But it is far better to be running it yourself if you can. Nodes in data centres don't add to the decentralisation of the network, and you aren't in full control of the software being used.
It is pretty easy to set one up, and a bit of fun to have it running. Gives you a chance to learn a bit more about how it all works as well.

Yep, the bitcoin transaction fee applies when you shift bitcoin from 1 wallet to another. This depends on the current demand on the network and how quickly you want the transaction to be confirmed (though many exchanges make you pay a higher rate without giving you an option to lower it).
The fee doesn't depend on the amount of bitcoin. Buying in chunks in Coinbase won't affect the transaction fee when you want to withdraw, since bitcoin isn't actually moved when you make a purchase on an exchange. Your main concern would be coinbase's initial buying fee, if you are paying a % fee with each purchase there would be no difference there either.
Due to the demand these days, transactions with no fees don't usually make it into a block.
edit: just to be clear, the bitcoin transaction fee is different to the fees you pay Coinbase when buying BTC. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:48:50


The relative increase of future supply compared to existing supply is certainly important, and the capped final supply of bitcoin is one of it's key points. If that's what you were referring to then fair enough. 
I know many folks who have brought coins purely based on the number they are getting per $, so I have just grown weary of folks who only look at the absolute number of coins and nothing else. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:00:40
I have to say, the style of some of your posts seems familiar.
Anyway, I think the main thing folks had against [u/ghee99]( was the continuous non-stop stream of posts telling everyone else who posted that BTC was dead and going to zero, without much discussion about points raised on the other side of the coin.
The issue I guess is that many folks with various motives come here purely to mindlessly attack bitcoin, if this was allowed the sub would be a mess and no discussions could really happen. I'm sure negative opinions on here are welcomed by most if the discussions are more thoughtful and meaningful. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:03:10


You realise bitcoin has 2.1 quadrillion satoshis right?
I am by no means at all defending digibyte, but if you are placing any weight on the number of total coins when considering which currency has a bright future, I think you need to take some more time to learn about how  these decentralised currencies actually work.

The list of places accepting LN payments ( is growing quite quickly, despite LN still being in a testing phase. 
As well as increasing the number of high capacity routes, folks setting up big nodes are helping to test the LN in more demanding situations than most other users, so they are certainly helping its development.
@_date: 2018-09-28 11:03:42
yep you can do that. You have to download and validate each block, but you can set a limit to how much you want to store on disc. So that once it reaches that limit, it will start deleting old blocks as you download new ones.
You can specify the size of the stored chain yourself, the minimum size is 550 MB.
To do this, if using Bitcoin-Qt, you need to go to the bitcoin.conf file and add the line 'prune=550', then restart Bitcoin-Qt.

I'm sure that is obvious to everyone here. The ecosystem needs to develop further to the point where franchise expenses can be paid in BTC, before they are able to accept BTC directly. As the number of ways in which you can spend BTC increases, the use their employees have for BTC will increase, and eventually it will make sense for some companies to also pay employees in BTC.
It's a gradual process, not instant, as most critics of BTC seem to expect.
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:10:12
Difficulty re-adjusts every 2016 blocks to maintain 10 blocks per minute. In such a scenario, the hash rate would drop until mining becomes profitable again. Remember the network was working fine when BTC was $5.00.

Bitmain can control BCH but they can't stop decentralised money. If they managed to get BCH more valuable than bitcoin, BTC would still exist and be used by those who prefer decentralised money. If instead somehow they took control of BTC, those people would then move off on a new fork.

Also the psychology would depend on your buy-in point as well I think. For me my average buy-in was around $700 (with some brought around $1,000), I can imagine if I had brought everything near the start of that run, at say $200, my approach would have been a bit different.

The key here, you see, is the 'after'. This process will take some time. Folks jumping in with no understanding of what they're doing seem to expect everything to happen immediately. These same people would have declared BTC dead after the ordeal of the first bitcoin transaction for some pizza.

The people here who believe in bitcoin's future will tell you to buy (like me) and the haters will tell you not to.
spend some time and learn about why it was created and how it works, then you can decide for yourself if it is a good idea to get a hold of some, instead of relying on the opinions of others.
A good list of resources to get started is here: [
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:31:08
I would argue the line roughly connecting the last three major peaks is more indicative of breaking the down trend, at the moment that's sitting around $7,800 (prob be 7.6-7.7K by the time we get there).
But I hasten to add that I am talking shit.
@_date: 2018-08-14 08:06:49
Haha shamelessly admit to still playing that one every now and then.

coin map currently lists 13,071 venues which accept bitcoin
This includes the roughly 3,000 ATMs, so other venues would number at around 10,000. Also this isn't including online-only stores.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:21:55
this argument has been used up. As is pointed out every time, many of the largest wallets belong to exchanges, some of which have millions of customers. But you know that. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 06:53:00
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:12:28
I would, seeing as I'm effectively doing that now by converting what I can to BTC.
the volatility argument is a shorted sighted 'why isn't it ready NOW!' argument. bitcoin is volatile due to its small size (it is still smaller than many stocks). It had to start from zero remember. If we get to the stage of more wide spread adoption, the total valuation would be significantly higher and hence more stable.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:15:23
I wasn't following it too closely around that time due to other things going on and the general negativity around bitcoin (after getting in during the end 2013 run), but I think it was a very gradual transition. There was no point where you could really say a bull market was starting, things just gradually started getting more positive. You didn't know we had hit the bottom until well after the fact. It wasn't until we broke back through $1,000 that I really started to get more excited. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:13:56
The beauty about the blockchain is that you can actually see what is really happening. bitcoin has 12.9x more transactions than bch in the last 24 hours, remembering that this includes batched transactions in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:11:14
It kept crashing lower and lower from $1,000 to $100 gradually over 2 years, yet people now are calling the end above $6,000 (I suspect social attacks, but w/e). Folks need to put in some effort to learn what they got into before panicking.
@_date: 2018-08-03 03:56:54


no shit. every time it reached a peak we should have sold, every time it crashed we should have brought. We should all therefore be millionaires, living on private islands in the Caribbean. But we're not, because in real time no-one knows what the fuck is going to happen next.

Yes it needs to be much more widely adopted, but it is by no means at all abandoned. Right now, the larger effective blocks allowed by \~40% adoption are enough to keep the mempool mostly clear (1 sat/b transactions are going through) and LN is still in an exploration phase, so there is not a strong incentive atm for the more lazy, slow movers to come across.

instead of counting on other people's thoughts and news articles, I suggest you put in some time to study and learn what bitcoin is, how it works and why it was created. Then you can come to a more solid conclusion yourself about what you think the future of bitcoin is, and then decide what to do from there.
Good list of online resources (including a link to the original paper): [

what is peer-to-peer about a network where the peers can't validate transactions themselves?
Before you tell me anyone can download several GB every 10 minutes (which they can't), don't forget that a node also has to then upload those blocks to the other 7+ connected peers. And then they have to pass it on to their peers etc etc.
And before you attack LN, remember that all LN transactions are eventually validated through the blockchain as well, and that an LN node uses the blockchain to validate that all open channels are legitimate.
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:19:55
the point is to grow the bitcoin ecosystem, with the aim that eventually you wouldn't be dealing with fiat at all.

this is the first coin called Bitcoin Core.
the argument here is that, if your point of view is that decentralisation doesn't matter and people should trust others to run full nodes, then Bitcoin Core does a fair better job than Bitcoin Cash.
obviously for those who want to be able to validate things themselves, they wouldn't be using either.
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:28:04
'don't buy any until it's shooting up' is how you lose at bitcoin. we won't know it's bottomed out until it passes like $12,000. If you're planning on buying, holding off completely could be risky (as is going all-in now). 
@_date: 2018-08-08 10:24:51

@_date: 2018-08-21 03:49:36
Yes that's right, and this is repeated for every such story by folks who seem to expect the bitcoin economy to suddenly switch from 'off' to 'on'.
That isn't how it works, the economy needs to be built up gradually. Only when expenses can be paid in BTC will merchants be able to skip fiat completely. Steps like this, paying bills in BTC, are good steps forward towards that goal.

Believe it or not, when you submit a transaction, the average time before the next block will be 10 minutes no matter how recent the previous block was. The probability of finding a new block from each hash is independent from the number of previous unsuccessful hashes.

This right here is why a change in bitcoin's cap won't happen. Who would want to switch from a chain with fixed eventual supply to a fork where you lose a constant % of your value every year due to increasing supply, with no upper limit?

Bitcoin is a community project. It's direction is not chosen by a group of people who *feel* it should be working in a particular way. It's direction is chosen by the community majority. This is the whole idea of bitcoin.


Lightning is a peer to peer network which will be accessible wherever the underlaying blockchain is. Further, a farmhand would be more capable of running a lightning or bitcoin node than a node of a blockchain which has large blocks.

Plenty of trolls and negativity everywhere, the toxic infighting was starting as well which I took as a significant sign that BTC may not survive. was just getting a bit draining in the end.
the $1,000 mark was probably related to my break-even (\~$700), there was also a couple of false-hope recoveries during the crash so going all the way back up to that point showed that the chance of further growth was real.
It's hard to tell still this time around, I think the conditions are quite different and things seem generally more positive (remember as well that many, many people lost huge amounts of BTC in Mt Gox, which greatly increased the amount of negativity around the place) . I wouldn't be surprised at all if we continued down to significantly lower lows, but my general feeling is that we are near the low point now, and that we may just start to gradually creep up.

yes they would. I think the main issue arises when you go to spend them, if both addresses are used as inputs in the same transaction they will then be linked. but this should happen only of the send amount exceeds the balance in both addresses. Ledger (and probably others as well) makes this easier by giving you the option to create different accounts with different public addresses, and then only sending from 1 account.

services dealing with bitcoin can be governed, but no-one can regulate bitcoin itself (e.g. transactions, storage, issuance etc. ). There will be regulated services for those who can't deal with the responsibility, but those who want to remain in complete control can do so. Having the choice is the key. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:37:45
To create an inflationary bitcoin you would have to hard fork it. The 99% of people who didn't agree with the move would stay with the original chain, while the rich 1% would have no one left to take money off of through their inflating coin, defeating the purpose.

Yep. But, many seem to think bitcoiners all share the same opinions and use bitcoin for the same reason.
some use bitcoin for speculation, some for storage of value, some use it as a currency. As Lightning matures, the currency aspect will improve significantly. the choice is up to everyone individually, it can't be dictated to them.
if you have been out for that long, have a look into what's been happening with the Lightning network. Give it a go, even if only on a light LN wallet on your phone.

basically one of bitcoin's primary aims is to remain decentralised, which greatly restricts the number of transactions which can happen on-chain (otherwise resources needed for people to run a node become too great). Lightning is a second layer solution which allows for many transactions (with tiny fees) to occur off chain while keeping the number of on-chain transactions limited. 
BCH follows the idea that all transactions should happen on-chain and that people don't need to independently verify the blockchain and enforce consensus rules. This leads to cheaper on-chain txs, but takes you back to a centralised currency which many here don't want

blockchain.info (now blockchain.com) was pretty popular then for online bitcoin wallets. you should still be able to get to a wallet on there if you can log in.

you vote in bitcoin by choosing which implementation you run. If you want to make some changes, make a fork and if everyone prefers it, they will change their nodes to your implementation. there is no need to introduce some polling system.

Many people don't like the idea of everyone taking control of their own value. I wouldn't be surprised if these people have been doing a form of social attack to try and create the impression bitcoin has been and gone and has no future. I also wouldn't be shocked if people are trying to divide the movement, a group fighting amongst themselves is easier to take down.
when people stop attacking bitcoin, it will either truly be over, or it will be everywhere. Until then, widespread attacks show bitcoin is still posing a serious threat. why else spend so much time attacking something you supposedly *know* is going to fail?
and then there are the parroting shitcoiners who have no understanding of decentralisation or why bitcoin was created, and just want their favourite coins to overtake bitcoin so they can become rich af. There are so many of them now pushing so many different coins, they are doing a good job of showing everyone else how scammy most altcoins are, all by themselves.

some governments will for sure release their own cryptocurrencies (e.g. Venezuela's Petro). But they will fundamentally be no different from fiat, and will only shift the battle lines between fiat and bitcoin. 
Centralised cryptocurrencies are the same enemy in a different skin.

yea I would be shifting them into a wallet you have the seed for ASAP. Never know what can happen, maybe one gets wet, maybe a heavy object falls onto one and breaks it, maybe it gets lost as well. Maybe it has a hidden electrical/hardware fault and is about to fail. If you have a significant amount at stake, I wouldn't risk it for any length of time. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 09:32:30


shit they are. there's only what, 10 days or so with higher transaction counts then where it's at now
@_date: 2019-03-14 23:37:10
Yes could be. If you used blockchain.info you should have somewhere a long string of numbers, letters and dashes which is your wallet id (not your private key). If you don't, and if it is linked to your email, you should be able to request the wallet id here: 
but you will need to remember/guess your password, otherwise without the 12 word seed you won't be able to access it. 
edit: I should clarify, if you find a string of numbers and letters which dose not have any dashes, this could be your private key so do not enter it into blockchain.com. if you find such a string, download electrum and try sweeping it into there. Though if it starts with a 1 or 3 it will only be the public key

LN allows bitcoin's purpose to be maintained, by allowing bitcoin to remain decentralised. If you don't believe, start a bitcoin node and see how much bandwidth and memory it uses already, despite the block restrictions.

LN is a decentralised project, there are multiple groups working on it and no official roadmap.

this comes up every time someone accepts BTC via fiat trades. You can't transition to a bitcoin economy overnight with franchise bills and salaries all paid in bitcoin, you need stepping stones. Things like this are not ideal but they are stepping stones.
More places start to do this, more people would be able to spend in bitcoin, so then shops can begin paying more people in bitcoin, and so start accepting bitcoin directly from customers since they can cover some of their salaries with it. So on and so forth until the shop can pay all their bills in bitcoin, and no longer needs to convert any to fiat. But it all has to start somewhere
@_date: 2019-03-07 02:34:48

the market cap doesn't equal the amount of money which has gone in, it is just the last exchange price \* the number of coins.
You could for example have a coin with 1 billion units and you could have sold 1 for $100 giving you a market cap of $100 billion.
If someone then sells one for $1 (because no-one wanted to buy it at a higher price for whatever reason), the market cap for that coin has then suddenly lost $99 billion, even though only $1 was exchanged.
All in all the market cap isn't a very good metric, particularly when it comes to alt coins which have a huge fraction of their supply pre-mined and locked away from circulation, artificially raising their cap.
For watching the price Cryptowatch isn't bad: [

arbitragers are another source of block space demand. I agree it most likely isn't a significant amount, but taking it off chain into a faster network will be good for those folks (since their coins are already held by a third party anyway) and may leave a little more block space open (how ever little it may be). 
People have argued that arbitragers may be placing a large burden on the chain, but I don't think they've said it's a wrong thing to do.

Take a look at the current situation with WEX to see if allowing XMR and disabling BTC is a good thing ;)
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:13:21
yea it basically allows you to transfer your BTC over to a side chain which could for example be similar to ETH or Monero. You then have all the extra benefits of that chain but you're still effectively using the same currency, with the same value. When you're done you can then 'withdraw' it back onto the main chain.
So if e.g. you want to make more private transactions, transfer your BTC to a Monero-like side chain and then just send them on, no need to go to an exchange and buy a different coin.
The side chains would also be merge-mined with bitcoin so you also get the increased security from the bitcoin network.

No variable in the equation concerns the number of units traded:


last trade at $100 =&gt; market cap = 1 billion \* $100  = $100 billion.
last trade at $1 =&gt; market cap = 1 billion \* $1 = $1 billion.
market cap lost is therefore $99 billion, is what I was saying.

I'm beginning to think this as well. Alts can be replaced by newer alts at any time, but you can't replace the original, and you know for certain that the original will remain scarce.
And if Drivechains really take off and give BTC the ability to preform all these extra functions, you will be able to do the niche tasks you want without the risk of your coin being replaced and devalued by a new currency, and without the inflation created by new currencies.

BTC is a deflationary currency, but the addition of other cryptocurrencies causes inflation, since you can always create more of them. Maintaining the fixed supply cap and preventing inflation is one of the arguments in favour of building everything on top of a single network rather than creating a new currency for each use-case.

As the other dude/dudette said, still in testing/exploration phase but here is a list of places which are accepting Lightning payments right now:
No bitcoin hard fork was required. The change needed in bitcoin to accommodate the Lightning Network was Segwit, which was implemented through a soft fork last year.
Currently to run an LN node you need a computer running a bitcoin node, there are a few phone apps which can send LN payments but I don't think they can act as there own independent node which can receive and relay transactions at this stage.

Im not sure if it will help, but set txindex = 1 in the bitcoin.conf file (within the 'Bitcoin' folder who's location is given during the installation)  after installing but **before** downloading the blockchain. This option is needed for the lightning node to work. 
I changed this option after downloading the blockchain and it had to re-index the whole chain, which took a day, but I don't know if it still does this if you set it = 1 from the start.
Still early days so it's a bit of a pain but worth it IMO, if you have issues let me know

So the random nodes used here include those with a single channel which has a very small capacity? Could this take up the majority of the 52% failed routings? 
Edit: if so, would it be possible to get a similar graph leaving out starting (and ending?) nodes who’s capacity falls below the amount being looked at? since if someone intends to spend a certain amount, they would have opened a channel with enough capacity.

Bitcoin wasn't hacked, an exchange was hacked. If you hand over control of bitcoins to a third party, you are now placing trust in them to look after them and hand them back to you when you want them. If you hold the key securely yourself, nothing at all can happen to them. 
bitcoin was made to eliminate trust in third parties, people who hand control straight back to them by sending their coins into an exchange forfeit the extra security bitcoin provides.

Yes. But allowing for more transactions in the blockchain comes at the cost of more data requirements and more resources needed to run a full node. In order for bitcoin to remain decentralised, people need to be able to run their own full nodes to independently verify bitcoin transactions. This becomes much harder to do as you increase the amount of transactions (and hence data) in the blockchain, and almost impossible if you wanted to ultimately handle every transaction made by everybody in the world on the blockchain.
the approach currently accepted by the majority to solving this issue is to develop second layers on top of the blockchain, which allow for unlimited, near instantaneous payments while keeping the blockchain as small and as distributed as possible. The main development effort in this area is focused on the Lightning network.

the idea is that you can spend it right within the lightning network (which you can do instantly after receiving the payment) without having to broadcast it on the blockchain. To cash out through lightning, we need exchanges to accept lighting payments, I believe there is one already
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:08:23


why did so many people chose to keep running the bitcoin core implementation if everyone disagreed with the block size, when an alternative with larger blocks was available?'


if you cannot run your own node, you cannot use bitcoin as a peer-to-peer system of exchange.
With the number of transactions needed to ultimately be handled, a quick-fix increase from 1mb to 2mb does absolutely nothing except band-aid the problem, and create a slippery slope towards centralisation.

@_date: 2018-06-01 10:13:55
I think eventually the block size may be increased, but not before transactions are made to be as efficient as possible. 
Another thing being worked on at the moment are Schnorr signatures, which will reduce the number of signatures required in a transaction involving multiple addresses. This will further reduce the average size of transactions on the blockchain.

@_date: 2018-06-04 12:31:59
It's going to be interesting how it develops. 
Connecting to a large node through a single channel ensures you can find a path to where you want to go. But at the same time, if you have several channels from your own node you increase the chance of other people's transactions passing through you (particularly if you can find nodes which are distantly connected), from which you can collect fees and which can help with rebalancing your open channels (if I understand it right). This behaviour may help to create a network which is less dependent on central hubs. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:36:45
I'm still learning but in addition to the other person's answer, I believe that if a channel becomes overly lopsided, the fees to go through it in the other direction can (automatically??) be lowered or even become negative to encourage transactions from elsewhere in the network to pass through it in that direction. How effective this will be, I don't know. 
Otherwise yea with an unrestricted channel you could wake up one day and find out you can't pay for breakfast without funding a new channel.

yea no doubt some manipulation involved. One of the clearest ones is when someone makes the price break downwards through support, waits a few minutes for the shorts to increase (everyone thinks it's heading down further) then forces the price back up into the short liquidation points. You could see this downward spike just before the massive $1,000 upward surge in April.

Renaming bitcoin (BTC) as Bitcoin Core is part of their strategy to create confusion for new people such as yourself, along with taking over the bitcoin.com domain (the official bitcoin site has always been bitcoin.org). To make matters even worse, there is now a new coin which is actually called Bitcoin Core (BTCC), which was created mainly for all the shits and giggles.
There are also many other forks of bitcoin like bitcoin cash (e.g. bitcoin god, bitcoin private, bitcoin world etc etc etc), though no others are really trying to claim themselves as bitcoin.

the point of bitcoin is to have control of your own money.
If you put them in an exchange, you forfeit this benefit. You no longer have control.
You cannot blame bitcoin for your loss if you give up this control and hand the keys over to someone you have never met. You can only blame yourself, for your lack of understanding.
If you want to be in charge of your own money, you have to think for yourself, you have to understand what you are doing. There is no easy way around that.

I agree the current block size won't be enough eventually to support LN for reasons like this, but I believe the overall plan is to make transactions as efficient as possible first, after which the block size will be gradually increased. If we jumped straight into block increases now, instead of adopting new methods of transactions and second layer solutions people will just keep going for bigger blocks as required, leading to a far larger block size far sooner, which many people won't be able to keep up with using today's internet and hardware. By focusing on efficiency first, individuals can still run full nodes while the capacity increases.

yea that is what I am most worried about. In the big picture, the rise from the low $3Ks has been quite smooth. IMO there will be a proper extended pull back at some stage, but from where to where who knows. I've been expecting one since before $6K, but I'm glad (so far) that I decided then not to wait for it before making my last buy.
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:48:19
people wait for the longs or shorts to pile up then sell/buy just enough to start hitting the  liquidation prices of the longs/shorts, forcing people to sell/buy which pushes the price towards more people's liquidation point, triggering a cascade of sells/buys.

coins in exchanges aren't usually lost forever (i.e. don't become inaccessible by anyone), they are stolen by hackers or the people who run the exchange and remain accessible for their new owners.

so first, 2 nodes **1**(++++) and **2**(++++)       *( + = 0.25 BTC)*
open 0.5 BTC channels between 1 and 2:   **1**\++----**2**    and   **1**\----++**2**
open channels with A and B:  **A**\----++**1**    and    **2**\++----**B**
If I'm following you right, you would end up with the following situation:
(rest of LN) +++---++ **A** \----++ **1** \++---++ **2** \++---- **B** \++---+++ (rest of LN)
(combining the 2 middle channels into 1 to make it easier). But here you still have no inbound capacity external of your two nodes (nothing can go from A to 1 or from B to 2). to receive/relay payments from outside your 2 nodes, you need at least this
**A** \+----+ **1** \++---++ **2** \++---- **B**
i.e. when you open up the channels with A and B, you still need to shift some bitcoin to the other side of one of them.

which does depend on mining, because if hash rate is continually increasing, the average block time will be less than 10 minutes. Difficulty adjusts to 10 minute blocks, then new miners starting up over the next 2 weeks gradually increases the hash rate and lowers the average block time until the next difficulty adjustment brings it back up to 10 minutes. The average over that 2 weeks then would have been less than 10 minutes. The opposite will happen if there is a period of decreasing hash rate

this is what I was thinking would change, I would imagine if blocks were significantly larger, people would be inclined to make more on-chain transactions (rather than using second layers) so the network would be receiving more transactions per second.

at least one of your nodes needs to have inbound capacity before you can send to it. If you do, then yea you can send payments to yourself to manage your channels, but you need the inbound capacity to an external node somewhere first.
edit: if you meant channel balancing directly between your nodes, you still can't receive/relay anything from outside your 2 nodes without inbound capacity

@_date: 2019-06-05 21:28:15
yea thats the idea. Initially, with minimal usage, a large mining reward was needed to encourage enough people to mine. but as bitcoin usage increases, the amount of fees increases and the reliance on the reward decreases, until you get to the point where the fees themselves are enough to sustain miners without needing to create any more bitcoin, allowing you to gradually transition from an inflating currency to one with a fixed supply.

being a digital currency, if the situation got that extreme it would be possible to change the decimal place and reduce the size of the smallest unit. This would require a hard fork, but in such a situation consensus should be achievable.

there's been a few discussions. Not many (including me, at this stage) agree but there is a good argument
@_date: 2019-06-10 10:40:10
when you run your own node, you can verify independently, without trusting anyone else, that bitcoin sent to you is real bitcoin, and has been sent into a wallet only you control. So when 2 people who have their own nodes transact with each other, since they both can independently verify it, they can make the transaction with no third parties (peer-to-peer) and with no trust.
When you use a light/mobile wallet without a full node, you are trusting someone else to verify your bitcoin transactions and to tell you that it is real. And for exchanges, you are giving up control of your bitcoin entirely.

You have to push some bitcoin to the other end of the channel, to do that at the moment you either have to spend some within LN, or you can use a service such as  where you send them bitcoin on LN and they send them back to you in an on-chain transaction. 
There are also a few places which will open an inbound channel to you when you open a channel to them. And if you leave your node running long enough, people will also start opening inbound channels with you (though you may need more channels and/or capacity to attract other channels)

I really do not like the new definition. If you applied the IAU definition strictly, as written, you can make an argument that Jupiter is not a planet, because it hasn't cleared its orbit (the trojan asteroids orbit ahead and behind it). The definition also states a planet has to be orbiting the Sun (not just a star), which would mean no planets outside the solar system (most people have rightly ignored this). It was rushed and not thought out.
IMO bodies which are large enough to have pulled themselves into a spherical shape but too small to undergo nuclear fusion in their cores should all be classed as planets, with sub-classes depending on what context they are found in.

Not all, but many buy alts with the goal of increasing BTC. They look at their value in terms of BTC and think that is what they are really valued at.
But: the total market cap of the top 20 after BTC is 8.5 million bitcoins. If everyone wanted to convert to bitcoin, for the current price of their alts in bitcoin, they would need to find enough people to sell to them all 8.5 million bitcoins. But there would likely be far less bitcoin being sold for alts, which means if everyone tries to convert the ratios will plummet and the majority would end up with only a fraction of what their 'portfolio' was supposedly worth in bitcoin. 
If bitcoin goes on a big run and leaves the alts behind, the altcoin - bitcoin market will become a game of musical chairs.

@_date: 2019-06-05 09:49:42
yep. The reward is halved every 4 years, meaning the mining fees become more and more important as time goes on. eventually, no new bitcoin will be mined (21 million bitcoin cap) so the miner's entire revenue will come from the fees.

indeed, cheap instant transactions are what it's about, fees received are only a side thing. There seems to be a few who think the point of running a node is because of fees.

nice, that's good to hear
@_date: 2019-04-24 22:24:10




Both of those have the same transaction fee (5.1 sat/vB, which is reasonably low).
So someone (or a company) likely makes a bunch of transactions at a given fee, then once the mempool clears down to that fee level, all of them can be added into the next block.
you cannot hold a block for several hours. This would mean you would have to out-mine the rest of the network for several hours after that block in order for it to be considered as part of the longest chain
@_date: 2019-04-23 03:07:44
forgot about that site, looks good.
a good direct illustration of the mempool activity can be seen here - [
colour bands are fee levels, the downward spikes are the removal of transactions included in a new block. Gives you a good feel about what fee is needed to get in within a certain time. Zooming out shows the times when there is less traffic.
particularly the bottom graph can help in fee estimating. It displays the amount of MB in each fee band. When you place your mouse over a line, it shows you how many MB is above that point.
edit: I see the above site also has a similar graph with these bands
@_date: 2019-04-21 09:51:05
yea this is prob an attempt to pass through the talk-of-bitcoin-only rule and promote this random shit
@_date: 2019-04-26 07:35:35
yea looks like it. But if we were to adopt a system where we create new coins for each thing we do, we are going to end up with huge inflation of money supply, which is one of the things we were originally trying to get away from. Whereas if each use case can be dealt with using the same currency, you avoid that inflation and maintain the stronger security of a single network, instead of the weaker security of many different networks.
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:21:46


fixed at 21 million, as you can verify (and enforce) yourself if you set up a node.


If you are not running a node for a given currency, you are not making peer-to-peer transactions in that currency, you are trusting others. fiat works great already in this regard.
For a decentralised peer-to-peer solution, check out LN. it is awesome.

then go off and create a chain where these coins are removed, nobody is stopping you. See how many others follow you. 
I for one would never touch a chain where somebody has had their value taken away from them by the rest of the network.
no matter who you are, how much you have or what you are doing, your coins or transactions should never be censored by the bitcoin network. This is a truly fundamental point of bitcoin, and you should put in some more time to improve your understanding of why bitcoin exists at all.

@_date: 2019-04-02 03:16:37
will be interesting how it develops. I need to look into it more, but my initial understanding is that the payout received by alt blockchain miners using this system depends on how quickly the transaction gets confirmed. If the PoP transaction confirmation is delayed, they get no payout but still lose the bitcoin miner's fee. So they need to put in high fees in order to get confirmed asap, which leads to bigger losses if they don't get in, and so more urgency to get confirmed quickly. This will lead to an escalation in the fees required to get into the next block and will make Viriblock expensive to use.
edit - don't agree with this from their site:


since the blockchains using Veriblock are introducing new tokens (inflation)
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:00:34

@_date: 2019-04-24 08:16:06
interesting isn't it. It's also helpful to see why if you write a short program using a random number generator and a &lt;= selection threshold equivalent to the 1 block / 10 minutes probability at each time step. As you increase the simulation time, you can see the average time from any time step to the time of the next selection approaches 10 minutes.

There are traders, and then there are those who buy bitcoin then just leave it sitting on the exchange. If you actively trade, fair enough (at least until decentralised trading improves), but if you don't trade and don't plan to sell soon, you are putting yourself at risk for no reason by keeping them on there.

there is far more to it than just downloading the blockchain. You should start a full node with open ports and see how much data and resources is used by the current limit.

You have a bot which, say, buys when x conditions are met, where x is usually followed by an upward movement. You let other people use this bot. Now when x conditions are met, you have a whole pile of others also jumping in and buying at that moment, raising your own average buy-in point and altering the subsequent movement. When your bot goes to sell, everyone else sells too and your average sell price is lowered. Even if you don't give away the code, you would still end up making less money due to the trading actions of people using the same strategy as yourself.

Buying bitcoin depends on where you are, but there should be multiple services you can use to easily sign up, deposit money and by bitcoin.
For your personal wallet, only use a phone wallet if you're getting very small amounts, as they are less secure. A more secure option is the (free) desktop wallet [electrum]( If you are getting a significant amount, look at getting a hardware wallet like a  [ledger]( or [trezor]( which are the most secure options.
The most important thing with a bitcoin wallet is to safely store the 12 or 24 words given to you when you create it - these words allow you (or anyone else who can get them) to restore the wallet on another device if you lose access to your original wallet. don't store these words on your computer where others can see - write them down and keep them somewhere safe.
if you can, take some time to learn about how bitcoin works and why it was created, which will help you in deciding how much to put into it and what to do with it. A good place to start is here - [

the recommended fees don't guarantee you'l get in during that time, if there was an increase in traffic in the hour after posting the transaction there can be a rapid buildup of higher-fee transactions which will need to be processed first.

A network securing everyone's wealth, to which anyone can contribute, and which operates by consensus of users is completely different to a consumer product/platform where you are buying/using something made and sold to you by a closed business.
If the company/platform faces no competition, improvement stops, development stagnates and consumers are forced to use bad/old tech. In a decentralised currency, users don't have to rely on a company making improvements, they can contribute directly to it themselves or build on top of it, and together they can dictate what direction they want it to head in. if you don't agree with the direction the majority are heading or want to do something else, you can create a side chain, or if you're happy not to exchange with everyone else you are free to go off on a fork.
sure, there are some networks doing things which cannot currently be accomplished by the main network (e.g. the increased privacy of Monero, compromising scalability) and it's useful to explore different ideas. but creating more money to do things which could really be achieved with a single existing network (including side chains) harms everyone except the creators and compromises security for no reason.

If you can't control/access the private key or seed phrase, you are not in control of the bitcoin, and this software shouldn't be used.


It's standard practice to write down the seed phrase at the moment the private key is created. But if you just have the private key, you don't need the phrase to restore it in a wallet.


no private key becomes unusable. The older address formats are still valid.


You can send BTC between newer and older address formats. You only run into problems when sending to a new address format using wallet software which doesn't support it. If you have the private keys or phrase, just simply restore your keys in a new wallet which does support the new format (your bitcoin will still be in the old address, but you can now send to a new address format). You are never locked in, unless you don't actually control the private keys.

Yea yea I know, bad context. but it kind of ties in to your general question of why bitcoin has value at all in your top post. If you take away the belief / agreement / assumption / assertion that fiat is wealth, why would fiat be wealth? Why would your mate take $5 for a slice of cake?
bitcoin is wealth because people have agreed, independently from governments, that bitcoin is wealth. The lack of government enforcement (taxation) doesn't mean an agreement of what is wealth can't be made amongst a group of people. Some people specifically want to make an agreement which lacks government involvement, and which involves something far more practical and easier to get out of the country than gold. Others don't, which is fine.

the main argument is that this could lead to a slippery slope of ever increasing block size (being the 'easy' option) and increasing centralisation, and takes emphasis/urgency off efforts to increase efficiency. By focusing on efficiency first (and 2nd layer solutions like Lightning), the capacity can be increased while maintaining the current level of decentralisation, and the ultimate block size (after eventual size increases, which more people should be able to handle in the future) should be significantly smaller.

sounds great doesn't it.
But many others think it sounds fantastic as well. So they buy in, and when the fork happens they'll be selling to get that extra BTC. But in terms of BTC it's a zero-sum game, so if you don't get the timing right you could be in trouble quickly. As someone else noted, the drop may well happen before the fork if enough people want to take profits from the pre-fork rise and get out of there before it even happens. There will also be shenanigans going on between the creators trying to crash each other's chain.
You could certainly make money if you get it right, but there's a fair bit of risk involved.

while many other cryptocurrencies may be, bitcoin isn't a product, it is an agreed upon method of value storage and exchange, achieved through consensus of all users. It is fundamentally different to the majority of other cryptocurrencies.
one of bitcoin's main points is to be a decentralised currency which cannot be controlled or censored by any authority or group. it is easy to create a digital currency with fast payments and low fees, and which appear to fix shortcomings in bitcoin. You can find hundreds of such currencies now, and in fact methods using traditional government-controlled currencies do a reasonable job of it these days, if all you're interested in is convenience.
What isn't easy, is to do all this while maintaining decentralisation, with everyone independently verifying all transactions and enforcing consensus rules, with no central authority being able to dictate the rules or being able to censor any transactions. This is what bitcoin is aiming to do, and while it may be the oldest, it is continually improving through new developments such as the Lightning Network. Achieving this also requires a large distributed network to work and to maintain security, which is where being the oldest really comes into play. It's reliability has been proven over the last 10 years, and it has survived all forms of attacks.
Before falling for the hype of better-than-bitcoin alternatives, I would suggest taking a bit more time to understand why bitcoin was created in the first place.

did you write down the 24 words which would have been shown to you by the wallet when you created it? if so, all you need to do is to download Electrum, set up a new wallet and then sweep your old wallet into it [as described on electrum's site](
you don't need to offer $3,500 for this. If you have the 24 words (or private key), there is only a couple easy steps you need to do, if don't have the 24 words then there isn't much you can do. (though if you made a backup of your laptop the wallet.dat file could be on there)

*Grandpa:* See a 'Bitcoin', kids, is what they called a hundred million satoshis back in my day. Because a satoshi was so cheap back then, you see, that they grouped them together into these bitcoins. I had several of them! They were like nothing more than bits of candy. But I gave them all away. People haven't used that name for years now, because hardly anyone has that many satoshis any more.

Earlier versions of this map were more dominated by 2-3 large nodes which were clearly on another level compared to the rest. Now there is a flatter size distribution with plenty of medium-large sized nodes and no utterly dominating ones. The blurry mess in between them all highlights how interconnected they all are; you can delete the largest ones and still get to the majority of the network within 2-3 hops. 
So it's moving further away from a hub-and-spokes model and closer to a more decentralised mesh-like network. Which is pretty cool to watch, remembering that nobody is directing this. Still a few overly large ones but it should keep improving as the network grows.

basic: people want bitcoin to remain decentralised, but that puts a limit on the number of transactions the network can handle (otherwise too much resources would be required by people to independently store and verify the bitcoin blockchain). Also, each block of confirmed transactions occurs roughly every 10 minutes, which is too slow for every-day purposes.
the solution is to build a 2nd layer on top of bitcoin which allows many more transactions, each one confirmed within seconds, and with significantly lower fees; this layer is called the Lightning Network.
You first create an LN payment channel (with however much bitcoin you think you'll need) through an on-chain transaction, from there you can make as many transactions as you like to spend that bitcoin within the lightning network (or receive bitcoin from others if you have inbound capacity available). You can then close the channel to send your remaining bitcoin back to a normal wallet.

Turned out that people who couldn't agree with consensus can't agree with each other either. Certainly an interesting observation isn't it.
As far as I've gathered, one side wants to increase block size indefinitely with no alterations to the protocol while the other wants to try and implement some changes.
The first is called Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision ( lol I still can't get over it ) while the second is ABC.
The need to increase their capacity is urgent, as apparently the current block capacity being over 200x the current average block size is cutting it too fine.

people always use this Myspace example but it is fundamentally different. Myspace / Facebook are social networks where users have very little at stake, there is no personal wealth held or exchanged on there who's security and utility depends on the network, there is no cost to set up accounts on either platform, bugs/hacks/rule changes don't leave users without their life savings so there is no risk in going to a new platform with potential hidden flaws. How each one operates isn't decided by consensus of users, but is controlled by the companies that run the platforms, so you are at the mercy of what the company thinks a good platform is, if a better company comes up and the old one doesn't change everyone has no choice but to switch if they want the better experience, they cannot collectively improve the experience themselves.
switching social networks operated by different companies is inconsequential, and the only option if better ones come up. This is not the same for a global currency operating on consensus.

unlike most other digital currencies, bitcoin is decentralised which means people run their own nodes. the drawback of this is that on-chain transactions are slower and limited in number.
The solution to this issue is to introduce second layers built on top of bitcoin, the main one being the Lightning Network. Once an LN channel is open (using an on-chain transaction), the number of transactions you can make is unlimited, and the confirmation time is a couple of seconds.
give it a go! the easiest way to jump in is probably the eclair wallet on Android
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:50:49
from any point in time onwards, the average time until the next block is always 10 minutes (+- depending on hash rate and difficulty), because the time of each new block is independent of the time since the previous one.
A quicker time here may indicate hash rate increasing ahead of difficulty. That wasn't the case in November, where hash rate was falling, which is probably why there is a little jump back up there. (I assume that last label of 9.29 is for the last point)

when you go to open a channel, in Bitcoin Core go to help - Debug window -  Console and unlock your bitcoin core wallet with the passphrase, adding a time delay on the end, e.g. to unlock it for 30 seconds:

this should allow Eclair to make a transaction before the wallet is locked again.

I think there's a good argument for it. In running a node I've been surprised just how much data is used. Maintaining decentralisation has to be the first priority, as Luke says if you can't maintain decentralisation then there is no point in what we're doing here.
IMO there are currently bigger reasons than data/computer resources as to why many don't set up nodes, mainly that many just don't see/understand its importance. It can take time to really appreciate what a node does and how you need to be running one in order to be using bitcoin with no trust. But if chain growth continues to out-do tech growth, that side of it could certainly become more pressing in the future.
I don't think we could ever see a block size reduction now though, it would be almost impossible to achieve consensus on it unless the number of nodes gets dangerously low.

nothing is scrambled, there is no encryption in bitcoin. Bitcoin uses elliptic curve cryptography, basically you have a starting point on the curve (private key) and use a one-way function to get to another point on the curve (public key). You can derive the public key from the private key but not the other way around, which means you can share your public key without risking funds. Transactions from a public address are signed using the private key ([digital signature]( to show proof-of-ownership.
You are right that this itself is not what's valuable, it has been in use for a long time. The valuable thing it is used for here is that it allows people to have sole control of their bitcoin, and to send that bitcoin to someone else who can use the digital signature to independently verify that it is a valid transaction from the person who holds the private key, without needing to trust the sender or anyone else.

it is getting easier. eclair makes it simple to jump in and give it a go, but I don't think you can receive through that yet. more apps are being built (e.g. Zap (iOS and desktop), Joule (Chrome browser plug-in)) which makes using an LN node very simple, but setting up the node initially still requires a few steps.
People are aware of this, many developers are working on it and rapid progress is happening.
@_date: 2019-01-14 00:16:19
this is what most big-block supporters don't realise. You're not only downloading and storing the block, you also need to upload and propagate it to many peers, and on top of that you also need to download, verify and propagate all the new unconfirmed transactions coming in. And when a new peer connects to you, you have to help them get up to speed by uploading to them all the latest blocks. 
a small block limit uses a heck of allot of bandwidth

your computer also needs the memory and cpu to validate all the transactions and blocks coming in. you then need to upload them to your 8+ other peers, and help new peers get up to speed, so you end up uploading far more data than what you need to download.
Today my node has uploaded 52 times more data than it has downloaded.

the issue is that many smaller corrections also follow this pattern, up until they surpass the previous high, so you can't know if you are in a correction or a crash until it's too late. Then you have situations like 2013 where the first crash didn't really complete and was quickly followed by another massive run-up.
easy to see in hindsight but it can't be predicted, even if the pattern is following the same as a previous event.

you can only make money off a fork as long as someone else is willing to buy the fork coins off you. They are worthless unless significant numbers of people move across and start using it and accepting it. Initially there were many buying them off others out of speculation, but more people now are releasing that without the underlying network of bitcoin, they are useless.

many people look at how many bitcoins they can buy with x amount of money. They then look at things like ripple and see that each coin is really cheap, so they can buy thousands without spending ridiculous amounts of money. they equate more coins = better value, without realising that the 'coin', i.e. the fraction of the total supply which is considered to be 1 coin, is completely arbitrary and can be made as small as you want.
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:45:25
That’s right in a way. it isn’t the bitcoin itself which is valuable. The 1’s and 0’s of a bitcoin on its own means nothing, like the 1’s and 0’s representing amounts in a bank account means nothing. It’s the trustless system of storage and exchange which is valuable. Some people are willing to offer goods and services (or fiat) for a unit in this system-of-exchange, because they know that they can then use this system to exchange that unit for another good/service/fiat for themselves, from someone else who also uses the system of exchange. The more people which take part in it (speculation or otherwise), the higher the demand for the fixed amount of units is, and hence the higher the value of each unit.
That’s all it boils down to, an agreed-upon medium of wealth storage and exchange. Whether you value it (and hence offer goods/services for it) or not is up to you.

My housemate is similar. He brought xrp (quite a large amount) at around the same price because 'ripple was going to overtake bitcoin'. when I pressed him further about why he didn't like BTC and how XRP was better, he didn't know what a node was and had no idea that Lightning even existed, let alone anything else happening in bitcoin (or ripple). 
@_date: 2018-11-06 03:17:55
My guess is that a few people want 2 coins for the price of 1 (or anticipating that others will), hoping to sell both for more BTC.
but of course it is a zero-sum game in terms of BTC, so if this is true many will be in trouble once the fork happens.
Ver and Wright trying to crash the other's coin will be interesting to watch as well.
I hope those trying to play it do well, but I think I'll be sitting this one out.

The LTC/BTC ratio exploded during the November 2013 bubble. If you were able to catch it (I wasn't), you were gaining fiat value at an incredible rate. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:36:25
Seriously, we get it. You called "bubble" over and over until you were right, just like thousands of other armchair economists. We get that you think bitcoin is a ponzi or a pyramid scheme. We get that you think they're digital beanie babies, doomed to sit forever in someone's digital closet collecting dust. We get that you think a limited supply, decentralized, unregulated currency has no chance of ever succeeding.
So my question is - why are you still here? What are you hoping to accomplish by repeating the same arguments over and over? **We heard all the exact same shit in 2011, and here we are two years later, still trading at \~$70.** You aren't going to convince us that bitcoin is dead, or even dying, so why bother? What's your goal here? You won't rest until every poor sap has pulled all their dollars out of BTC so the world economy can get on with business as usual?
Why don't you just come back in two or three years when the next bubble inevitably pops and try to convince us again? **Third time's the charm, right? Will you be using the same arguments if it reaches a high of over $1000 and crashes back to a stable $250?**
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:56:12


I don't understand this argument. You folks want blocks too big for most users to run their own node today, yet claim BCH is more decentralised? In the meantime, the future of BCH today is now in the hands of a few people fighting in a dick waving competition and putting up silly comments and gifs on twitter.
You should try running a Lightning node on your computer, tied to a bitcoin node on your computer to see for yourself what decentralisation really means. Instead of parroting shills, export the LN map into something like Gephi and look at the network's structure. Delete the largest nodes and look at the resulting connectivity of the network, keeping in mind how early in development it still is.

Today bitcoin income would only be a small amount, so they would use fiat from the rest of their income. As the portion of their income from BTC grows, the ecosystem will be growing as well, giving you more ways to use the BTC without taking it out of the LN.
What many critics seem to miss is that things can expand and change with time. People were laughing at the celebrations of LN reaching a total capacity of 5 BTC, explaining how limited and useless the network is, and that it will never be adopted at any meaningful scale. Now it is over 440 BTC and the number of shops continues to grow, despite still being in an experimental phase. And of course we hear the same repetitive arguments from critics, and will no doubt continue to do so for a long time.

Being able to run your own node and verify everything yourself without needing to trust anyone else is one of the key points of bitcoin.

A large exchange was hacked (Bithump), shortly after there was a large number of transactions with extremely high fees, someone was wanting to move a lot of BTC fast (presumably Bithump making sure the rest of their BTC was safe). This had a knock-on effect for fee estimating wallets, which pushed the fees up even more. For a few hours afterwards, 1 sat/b transactions were clearing yet people were still unnecessarily sending transactions with high fees.

I don't understand this stability argument used specifically against bitcoin (in the context of eventual large scale adoption). A new currency which started from nothing is always going to be unstable to start with, no matter what it is. The only way you could avoid that would be to have a systematic national/global shift to the new currency on day 1. As the adaption and use of the new currency increases, stability would increase as well. Bit of a chicken-and-egg situation for sure, but it can keep growing as long as there are folks who value its properties.

Then in Preview I dropped the edge thickness to 0.1 and dropped the edges opacity to 0.30 (otherwise for me the edges would dominate in the exported pdf). Still playing around though, I'm sure there are better and quicker ways to do it.

We didn't approach the 2013 rate of increase before the $19K peak, so I was hesitant to call the top. part of the issue I think is that the last rise was much more drawn out compared to the ones in 2013.

blockchains aren't inherently secure, they are only secured by the computing power of the network. If there are many individual blockchains for each case with limited incentive for people to use resources to generate blocks on each one, they will be able to be easily altered by 51&amp; attacks.

Let the traders play their silly games with each other, they have no idea what is really going on here. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 22:16:34


to my **limited** understanding the person that receives the payment can't see which node it originated from, because they only know information from the last hop in the chain and can't see if the last node the payment passed through was the 1st, 2nd or 3rd (etc) node in the payment chain. The only case where they could identify the origin node is if you had a single channel connected directly to the person you are paying, so that no other payments could be routed through you to them (or if only 1 path involving the last node has enough capacity to handle your transaction, but I think this would improve once transactions can be split across different paths). 
I might set up a second node and see if this is the case or not. 
How do you believe the transaction can be traced back to the originating node (or is what I said not true)? (genuinely asking :) )
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:27:59
A lightning node running on your computer can list all the currently active nodes and connections in the network, so if you know the node id for a shop, you can see for yourself if it's active!
If you really want to, you can also output this into a graphing program such as Gephi to see a node's connections more clearly (and to see how well connected you/they are to the network, using the heat map tool)

It wouldn't surprise me at all if there is a social attack on bitcoin in an effort to prevent the rise of a decentralised, uncontrollable currency. Firstly to create an impression that it is a scam and ultimately doomed to fail, and secondly, since the strength of any truly decentralised currency depends on the size of the network and the number of people driving it forward, to split the movement into groups and create toxic infighting. Divide and conquer, as they say.  
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:05:20
No point at all. It's not about digital money, it's about decentralisation. People trying to do this (or any other controlled approach) have completely missed the whole point of cryptocurrency.

you can buy small fractions of a bitcoin. The definition of a whole coin in a digital currency is completely arbitrary. You can for example think of one bitcoin as being equal to 100 million satoshis, or 1 million bits.

Yea true, the pace of development is pretty exciting. My belief is that the requirement of a fee will be hard to overcome for a completely  decentralised coin but we'll see. I look forward to what crypto will look like in 10 years. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:54:58
Interesting idea. The top voted comments in these threads are also often attacking BTC or supportive of BCH, or pointing out how this is a petty attack (as is the case here). 
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:09:09
I think that's correct, no? If fees are too low, it would be easy to bring the network to a halt (e.g. the IOTA spam attack). There are very good reasons for the fee structure in BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:17:46

With BTC being consensus driven, that is up to all of us. Given that increasing the cap will decrease the value of everyone's coins, I don't think the majority would agree to it.

My understanding is that if you're trading back and forth between BTC and fiat, each trade into fiat is taxable, and therefore these folk end up with a large tax bill even if they have everything back in BTC at the time. To cover the cost, they then have to sell.

If a private blockchain isn't secured by a large network, someone could do a 51% attack to change the data couldn't they? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:22:45
For trades on an exchange, the transaction occurs between accounts on the trading exchange site, which is managed by the exchange and doesn't involve movement of actual bitcoins (which are all stored in a central wallet/s). Only when you deposit or withdraw BTC is a transaction made on the blockchain. (and also after you deposit into your account address, those BTC are moved into a central wallet almost straight away).
You can see this behaviour if you look up your exchange deposit address on the blockchain.

Not putting solid text boxes on top of the graphs may not have been too bad of an idea. 
I would think the network is still too small to start looking into the network structure. At the moment, I'd say people are joining in to try it out and to connect to and buy something from 1 or 2 stores, which likely leads to a less connected network. This dynamic would change as the network matures and the uses of lightning become more diversified.
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:27:04
Doesn't matter at all what the price is doing, for years people have seemingly gone right out of their way to attack bitcoin. Why search out forums specifically made for the community purely to attack it? Seems a bit odd no? Perhaps people really are just that hateful.

@_date: 2019-05-22 12:24:17
so your saying that miners who go for cheaper fees will find more blocks (up to a limit)?
I would think the fee market would re-adjust such that the fees in the lower tier would come up, since the cheaper transactions would be competing with each other for space within the block allocated to them, with the end result being that it would be no different than a straight increase in capacity. that's my thinking but could be wrong.

(among others) due to the restricted block size, you can run your own bitcoin node and independently verify that transactions sent to you are using real bitcoin following the consensus rules you agree with, and that the bitcoin is really located in a wallet in which only you control, without needing to trust anyone else. To compensate for the on-chain restriction, bitcoin is developing transaction capacity off-chain (e.g. Lightning network) to allow for unrestricted, cheap transactions which do not add more burden to full nodes. 
In BCH, the blocks (if used as intended) will be too big for most people to run their own nodes, meaning that they can no longer independently verify their transactions and will have to trust others. They also cannot verify if the consensus rules (e.g. 21million cap) are being followed.

setting up an additional 'decoy' wallet with a small fraction of your total holdings is something a few have suggested. Ledger for example allows an additional hidden passphrase which creates a second wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:21:27
you are independently verifying that the bitcoin sent to you is real bitcoin, is really in an address only you control, and follows the consensus rules. With a node, you do not need to trust anyone else. This is really the point of a node.
But you also help the network in a way by uploading blocks to people who are reconnecting, and by increasing paths for block and transaction propagation. More paths makes it harder to hinder propagation (but I believe there is a point after which additional nodes don’t make a difference here)

There is only 1 bitcoin, which has the symbol BTC.
The others are copies created either by people seeking to replace bitcoin with a version which they have full power over, or to play on bitcoin's name to push their own currency and profits. These forks employ aggressive marketing tactics to convince newcomers that their currency is the true or next bitcoin.
The purpose of bitcoin was to create a decentralised, peer-to-peer currency which cannot be censored or controlled by any entity or government. Many forks go against this principle, and are really not much different to the controlled currencies which we are trying to escape from.
To learn more about bitcoin and why it was created, this is a great starting point: [

r / btc has long been a sub for people who prioritise large blocks over network decentralisation (as that is the position of the people who own that sub). When the bitcoin community committed to small blocks and 2nd layer scaling (such as the lightning network) instead of large blocks, these people couldn't accept the majority consensus and went off and created their own fork called BCH. The same people also paid for control of the bitcoin twitter handle and bitcoin(dot)com, and continue to push their fork as being the real bitcoin.
Since then, they themselves have forked (people-who-can't-work-with-everyone-else-can't-work-with-each-other shocker) and ironically the minority fork is now trying to claim to be the real BCH

don't even need bitcoin core (though I always recommend to set up a full node ;) ). The hardware wallets have their own software you can download from their respective sites.
Set up (for Ledger at least) involves, setting a password for the device, downloading software on your computer, installing the bitcoin app on the ledger and, most crucially, writing down a set of words which is a backup for your wallet. These words are effectively the keys to your bitcoin so they must be stored somewhere safe.
hardware wallets (Ledger or Trezor) are very safe, provided you look after your words.

We heard this all when LN capacity was under 3 BTC. Today we are nearly at 500 BTC and it's just getting off the ground. You can now make bitcoin LN transactions straight from your phone and internet browser, just as fast or faster than any fiat card transaction and with fees around a few hundredths of a cent, all built on top of a decentralised blockchain which is small enough to be verified on a cheap laptop or even a raspberry pi.

For the current state of the network, paying $20 per transaction is silly. Transactions of 1 sat/b are still getting through within a few blocks most days, even just 3-4 sat/b often guarantees next block.
looking at the mempool - [ \- getting a $20 average would require some interesting accounting, not unexpected from a site partly ran by Roger Ver.
anyway it's great to see average costs (in terms of BTC) going down.

many people don't ever question fiat, how it is created or why it has any value (I didn't for a long time either). From when they are toddlers, they just accept that this is how things are and go about their lives trying to get as much of it as possible because thats what they are meant to do, so they can spend it on the things people convince them that they need (or that show others how 'successful' they are).
It will take time for this engrained way of looking at value to change. I've certainly noticed in the last few years more people around me seem to be waking up to this.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:30:13


they look like it exploded from nothing. I agree they shouldn't be used. 


didn't know, that is pretty bad. 
I agree folks often start in linear and learn log (many are quick to correct them if they post a linear chart), but I don't think everyone switched to log purely to create a nicer chart in the bear market. Though I guess with so many new people entering during the run up, many could have learnt that only after the spike. I would hope they wouldn't switch back if another run-up happens.

taking it into account doesn't necessarily offset the impact of a reduction in the amount of coins sold by miners every day, on top of the normal buy/sell behaviour. Creates a different dynamic in the market.

A gain or loss from any point along a chart onwards depends on the % gain, not the linear gain. The best way to present this information then is using a log chart, not a linear chart.
This is standard practice, not just in bitcoin.

That was a clear bug which created billions of bitcoins, fixed by a consensus rules update which rejected value overflow transactions. Everyone was more than welcome to keep building on the chain allowing overvalue transactions if they wanted unlimited bitcoin created at an unlimited rate. No change was forced on anyone. If that happened again, I'm sure everyone today would still be against unlimited bitcoin.


This is currently very costly to do (look at the recent failed attempt on BCH, who's network is much smaller), and would result in the miners losing their source of income (due to plummet in price) making all the mining equipment needed for a 51% attack useless.

if you want cheap transactions on chain you need far more than 32 MB blocks. Also don't forget a node not only needs to download and store the block, it has to validate all the transactions as they come through and pass them on, as well as pass on the completed blocks, to 8+ other peers (often a node is connected to over 50 peers).
many users running their own nodes may not be the priority for more central currencies, but for bitcoin it is absolutely essential in order to maintain decentralisation.

welcome to the party! 
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:10:22
the main point of hardware wallets is to not have any file containing private keys on a computer connect to the internet.
the software you download for the hardware wallet never sees the private key. It has to send the transaction details to the hardware wallet which then signs the transaction, after you enter a pin. So to spend from it, the device has to be physically connected to your computer, the pin has to be entered, and also the send address has to be confirmed on the device. A malware-infected computer or dodgy wallet software can't access the keys so poses no risk.
I mean bitcoin core with a strong password is probably fine. just pointing out the benefits of hardware wallets ;)

This is a great site for judging when to send a transaction and for how much:
The bands are in sats per byte. 1 sat/b corresponds to 250 satoshis total for a basic transaction which is \~250 bytes, will be a little more if you have multiple input addresses. y-axis is number of transactions waiting to be confirmed.
When a price band isn't getting rapidly eaten away by blocks, you can expect to wait a little longer for a transaction with that fee level to get through.
@_date: 2019-05-03 07:01:59

I accept there are people following the first point to play the game and gain fiat from the situation, and others who buy only in the hope that it will go up so they can sell higher. Many have been brought up just accepting that fiat = value and don't ever question it. I realise this was a big part in the recent explosion. 
I emphasise though, that no matter what those people are doing, there is a growing number of others who value it for the freedom it gives them. There was a healthy dark market working perfectly fine with &lt;$10 bitcoin before most of us here even found out about it. They wanted to do things they otherwise couldn't with any other medium of exchange, no matter how fast and sleek the fiat transactions were. 
We will have many ups and downs through speculations, but the eventual price will ultimately depend on how many people want the freedom of an immutable, decentralised currency which cannot be taken away from them, and which can't be manipulated through inflation of supply. I hope eventually enough people will realise how much they are being controlled to challenge the fiat system, but only time will tell. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 03:19:26
understandable. I would imagine mempool drops after a new block not matching block sizes/transaction counts would reveal such shenanigans pretty quickly, though it may be easy to get away with a small number of transactions applying a light but constant pressure on the fee market.

@_date: 2018-12-05 04:12:13
I don't think the top scenario could play out too dramatically. There is a gradual gradient in the profit points of different mining operators, some who switched off (or even still mining), still may not make a profit now (note the current estimate for the next adjustment is still negative) and so can't re-enter yet (or will have to leave), for others they may be back in the green and so will jump back in. The marginal ones will have to stop again if the difficulty goes back up too much but it won't be a dramatic fraction and the rest will keep going. The process would continue until equilibrium is reached.
Keep in mind as well that there is a maximum difficulty adjustment, so you can't jump from a situation where all miners are profitable to where all miners are not profitable.
miners who are not profitable now, may indeed hold on to more bitcoin to sell later, if they think the price can rise again and provided they can cover their costs.
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:53:23
another thing to keep in mind is that there is a large gradient in the profitability point of miners, depending on the setup and local energy cost. Those using excess energy from renewable energy plants for example could probably keep going for a long time.  It would take quite a large event for 90% to suddenly be forced to shut down.

Someone please correct me of I'm wrong. A wants to send 0.01 BTC to C (I will ignore the fees here):
A -&gt; B -&gt; C
A sends a payement to B, which has instructions to send 0.01 BTC to C.  but B cannot unlock those bitcoin sent from A without a secret which is only revealed to the final node in the route. When C receives and unwraps the payment from B, since they are the destination node they find the secret key. C has to send this key to B in order for C to unlock the bitcoins in the transaction from B. Since B now also has the key, B can unlock their transaction by sending the key to A.
i.e. C doesn't unlock bitcoin from B until B is able to unlock their payment from A.
Each payment has a time lock on it: if the secret is not received within 10 blocks, the bitcoin is returned to the sender e.g. if B doesn't get the secret from C, they get their coins back from C and A gets their coins back from B.

I've given up trying to time the low. When the money arrives I just hit buy and try to move on, no matter what happens next.
@_date: 2018-12-14 06:46:29
I had some, 2 weeks after launch. Kept them in an exchange. 
Such exit scam, much wow.

Users won't switch from a capped chain to an inflationary one. These miners who do switch would then be mining a chain nobody wants to use, meaning the coin they are mining will have no value.

525 BTC and counting in the Lightning Network.

Well I hope their recovery plan doesn't rely on a coin whose price is tied to the state and reliability of their exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:38:34
eclair. Been out for a while ;)
For iOS at the moment you can only use apps which connect to your Lightning node on your computer
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:40:39
Below LTC is precisely where they should be, given their relative decentralisation and utility. Manipulation is the only reason BCH/ABC/BSV were ever higher.

bitcoin cash? 
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:27:21
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:19:08
that doesn't matter, the whole network could work on less than 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:02:06
yep, spending too much energy regretting past missed opportunities results in missing the opportunities of today.

if you are really curious about what bitcoin is, there is a great compilation of resources here:  ;) 
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:15:12


you don't need an enforcer to allow people to develop their own agreed method of value exchange. 
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:04:14
nup, don't remember that one.
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:55:09
it isn't just code you need to copy. You would need to copy the entire global network securing the blockchain and validating transactions, which you cannot do.
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:43:29


they should be, yes. Are they though? In the end, Mt. Gox was operating on a false:real ratio of 3:1.
 you never know your BTC is real unless you hold the keys. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 08:32:27
ok great, thanks for the information
@_date: 2018-12-22 00:22:34
if they're worried, they shouldn't be in there to begin with.
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:21:21
was probably some TA dude/dudette "predicting" the latest price movement after it happened, would be my guess.
@_date: 2018-12-04 03:28:30
Think of a simple name. Any coin name, and google it. It will exist. Quite often with 'a good team' and/or 'great tech'.

Horse shit, bull shit, kangaroo shit, it's all there.

people are using the 10 year anniversary of bitcoin (3rd of Jan) to remind others why bitcoin was created at all - to give you full control of your own money. 
So many now just keep BTC on exchanges, even if not trading. If you hold coins in an exchange, you do not control them at all (and can't even be sure they really exist - see Mt. Gox for an example). encouraging people to withdraw is encouraging them to take control of their own bitcoin.

Third party service provides are often perfectly fine and trustworthy until one day you wake up and can't log in. then that's it, thanks for playing.
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:43:49


honestly I don't think trading is the right thing to do for that situation / mindset. You could easily end up in a far worse position. 
There is no magic technique to make quick money in trading, at least none that others will tell you about.

I would extremely seriously doubt that


I can't think of a situation where a house someone would be happy to live in would be worth $0. Maybe if a nuclear reactor melted down next door and you don't mind living in the extreme radiation?

thanks, many here have had a tough year.
may have to grab some green candles now ;)

To access bitcoins in a dat file you can download the bitcoin client Bitcoin Core from here: 
You have to download the entire block chain (over 200 GB) and your computer has to verify each block, the whole process can take a while. 
Once up and running, exit it, find and replace its wallet file with yours, then re-start. you may have to enter a password if your wallet file was encrypted with one.
I would recommend you make another copy of your BTCwallet file and put it on something else first, so if the shit hits the fan you still have a good copy
If you want to learn about what bitcoin is while you wait, a good list of resources can be found here: 
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:30:40
They're probably including the inflated Bitfinex price in their calculation
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:47:36
it's all going to come together beautifully IMO
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:10:56
welcome on board! 
don't be lulled into a false sense of security by the recent price action, there will be plenty of rough times and sharp drops ahead. It is the nature of the beast. 
and if you haven't already, take some time to learn a little about bitcoin itself [ and look at spinning up a full node

I watch birds and think they probably have a greater time on this planet in their short lives than what many people do over several decades

same with me. There's so many trolls I'm often mis-interpreting genuine comments

it is an awesome cross-stitch. but man I hate false set-ups

yep, which can be altered to any value for any currency, so no significance should be placed on the relative price of one coin of one currency to one coin of another currency
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:40:29
as others have said, allowing everyone to independently verify transactions with no trust comes at a cost. To mitigate this, second layer solutions like Lightning Network have been developed, allowing for very cheap bitcoin transactions with fees less than a cent.
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:39:37


fair enough, thanks for letting me know :)

peer-to-peer exchange software running on your own computer, no company, no central server, nobody else ever holds your funds. transfer of funds is only from one person to another


unless, are you saying people need to stop trading with others they don't know?

when old relatives are saying bitcoin is dead, it is time to go all in.

to have the highest level of security possible, in the most distributed network possible, and a capped monetary supply.
everything else can be done in side chains of the main network.

another month or 2 at this level may just allow me achieve a personal target I thought had slipped out of my reach

by taking them out of the picture

if it gets to 1 million, fiat currencies will be in some serious trouble.
selling into fiat then would be like riding a boat up to your destination, but just as you almost get there you decide to jump into the river and get carried back to where you started by the current.

this is a site ran by bcash proponents. accuracy is something which is only considered in passing. 
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:01:01
I have to thank them for that though (along with their BCH airdrop). I was able to hit a target I thought would forever be beyond my reach.
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:37:09
yet we do. Ask yourself, why? 
Or just continue on with life. Things should be nice and simple by the time you come back

The clowns next door trying to claim the title of 'Best Circus', selling bitcoin to prop up their own tent. The clown show puts others off this whole business and they pack it up. People on edge after breaking year-long $6K support panic and join in the selling. chuck in some apparently bad (but actually meaningless and expected) news and down we go.
my guess anyway
@_date: 2019-05-20 07:13:31
the post was updated. Originally, they had a picture showing only the peak mempool around the last ATH.

Geez. that should go up on a poster or something. 
They're more than welcome to create a centralised fork which follows their rules. Good luck getting everyone else to use it though.

Wait, please don't post a picture of the codes on the internet, someone will steal the coins instantly if you reveal the key. Anyone who has the key can take control of the bitcoin.
Describing the general format of any codes should be enough for someone to help.

buying bitcoin with cash, or selling bitcoin for cash
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:27:19
yea I agree there wasn't much impact on the market. The only thing that's happened is Bitfinex has gone \~$350 ahead of everyone else due to people exiting the exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:42:43
think we would need a stronger bounce to break this.
shorts are back up near ATHs, a quick spike up could spark something off
@_date: 2018-12-26 11:42:00
well I must be fucking ***nuts***. Quick, someone tie me up and send me to the funny farm  
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:20:20
I'm not sure if 'the cloud' is the best analogy. the bitcoin is still sitting in a wallet, except now it is tied up in a multi-signature contract between you and the person your channel is connected to. This contract is on the blockchain.
One quick overview is here: [
