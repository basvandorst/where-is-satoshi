If court decides that mtgox has to pay creditors with remaining funds, how would that process work? Specifically when it comes to bitcoins?
Will an arrangment be possible where anything above X amount on someones account is not refunded, and the rest is shared between creditors, or will everybody get the same percentage refunded regardless of amount of btc/usd?

Maybe somewhere in your post or the title of your post you could mention that this is only applicable to US citizens?
edit: maybe rename title to "I am a tax attorney, here is what the IRS notice means to US citizens"

I see your point. Although one counterargument is that the overall speed and quality of the internet connection also increases over time, both for wired and wireless connections. So maybe the block size limit could be increased over time as well, without cutting off to many people. Question is, will the avarage internet increase increase enough to keep increasing the blocksize limit wihout too many problems?

@_date: 2014-03-01 22:59:57
hmm yeah gone..? was wondering too, bitcoins are never gone :) but you can't see in the blockchain whether someone payed USD or EUR's for them, you only see transactions to other bitcoin adresses. Only the exchanges might have a chance to see if any of those transactions can be linked to one of their customers.

1) it's about how it's represented in shops and bitcoin wallets. Right now, if I use the bitcoin client it still counts my bitcoins in BTC, not in mBTC
2) I believe mBTC, or millibitcoins, is not exactly the most catchy short name possible. I think it might actually influence how soon people will accept bitcoins.

I hope this is not real either, if it is, very sorry to hear.
But 1. your name is bitcon, as mentioned easlier, 2. where is any evidence, like a police rapport (they don't mention names right)? and 3. it seems weird that this guy killed himself without even knowing for sure if his money is really gone. I mean the hopes are down, but if I had so much in mtgox, wouldn't it make more sense to first wait to see what happens, and/or try to get money back trough legal procedues... instead he just 'gives' up without even knowing for sure his money is gone and does something irreversible?
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:18:31
you're right ;) I will call it bitcoin from now on if that pleases you... but not really on topic though...
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:09:31
ok thanks for the information, just this morning i was wondering if you would be able to easily send bitcoins to a non-existing address (address that nobody has the private key for) by just typing in a random address, but a checksum would prevent that then I guess.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:27:14
Can you explain why this pisses miners off specifically?
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:28:51
and if you messed up your wallet, can you find all the adresses that were used before, by just using your private key? and how would that work?
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:43:09
I agree with what you say, but the technology that Bitcoin offers allows for an unlimited number of digital currencies... then why (as a society) choose for a currency for which 4% of all (possible) coins is already known to be in the hands of thieves? Do you think that bitcoin is already so far integrated that it will be the 'chosen one', despite this problem? Before the massive theft I thought: if any currency is going to be widely accepted it will be bitcoin, because it is the first, the name is most known, and because there is no good reason to abandon it and use one of the others... but now I have my doubts. There seems to a reason now to use choose for another currency over bitcoin, one that still feels 'fair' (even though that is not guaranteed to stay that way)... but we'll see what happens, I'm still rooting for bitcoin to make it as the main digital currency too, because I invested in it too, I'm on your side ;)
But if you are so sure that bitcoin will be the main digital currency, and not one of the others, what exactly are your arguments for that? the arguments in your post seem more like bitcoin being accepted vs bitcoin not being accepted, but I'm talking about bitcoin being accepted vs another digital currency being accepted...

@_date: 2014-03-05 13:47:08
I agree with this. What I worry about for bitcoin (the currency) is the massive amounts of stolen bitcoins. MISSING bitcoins is not such a problem, but stolen? Major investors probably will try to take a glimpse in the distant future when they are considering if bitcoin is going to be big. But the bigger it gets, the more stolen coins are going to be a problem. Mt.gox might have lost 850.000 to hackers. And the amount of new bitcoins is quite limited, and eventually capped at 21.000.000. So you really want to continue investing in a currency, for which we already know that 4% is in the hands of a few thieves (and probably more to follow), and we can't do anything about it?
Imagine if bitcoins were to represent all the world's wealth in the distant future, then 4% is extremely extreme, unacceptable. And it's not so much a problem that 4% of the wealth is stolen, but the fact it is probably in the hands of only one or a few shady individuals. 
Again, I believe in the future of Bitcoin, that is, the protocol, but it wouldn't surprise me if bitcoin the currency is not going to be the preferred currency in the long run, because of the massive amounts of stolen coins. Another currency might be become bigger, one which is  mined AFTER we learn (and by we I mean the whole world) how to use the new technology more safer and prevent massive theft.

I'd rather see them spent and flowing NOW, than much later (in 10 years). Once everything is flowing I trust the valuta more than when 5%+ of all coins are still in the hands of god knows who.

There is an obvious difference in that bitcoin is so new that the name people use for mBTC might still be able to change to something easier. Obviously this is not the case for the metric system, OBVIOUSLY... Don't attack peoples argument if yours is worse...
Why do you think they chose Euro as a name for currency and not A.G.E.M. Or some other abbreviation? Because euro is a very easy and recognizable word. I think you're too much in love with bitcoin that any comments that might in anyway be seen as negative sets you off... Loser.
And we use Cents, not centi-euro.... Because... Cents is easier...

To me he comes off as somewhat autistic, very smart on one side but unable to function well in complex social situations, and not able to understand the social implications of his actions. Being so excited about hacking a register to accept bitcoins when your multi million dollar website is offline seems like something that wouldnt happen to a 'normal' person who is fully socially functional.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:47:20
I think you are correct about this. If hackers got the bitcoins, this is exactly what they would do. Try to pin it on someone else and obfuscate, and since they have Mt.Gox code (it is believable that this is mtgox code i think) it would be smart to use the mtgox code for splitting so it would seem like mtgox is doing something with the bitcoins.
I do believe that the servers of mtgox were hacked, and hackers kept draining the BTC's from the hot wallet. Mr karpales was too busy playing with his other little project, and didn't really (want to) understand what was happening, just kept draining the cold wallets so he could put of dealing with the problem, until things got really bad. And he might have assumed it could have something to do with the malleability and just blamed it on that for convenience.

Could also be used by anyone who is not native English. I work at a university in my non-english country and most researchers, if you ask, probably KNOW that favour might be english writing and favor amarican, but they are both used equally, cause we don't really care that much about different versions English that much... so using the word favour might mean that you are NOT from the US, but it certainly does not mean that you have to be British person.

that's sad... the culture of trying to sue people for about anything is so weird. Luckily in my country there is no 'jury of your peers' (a.k.a. bunch of random, untrained in law, medium intelligent people) that lawyers can play with. I wonder how Americans think about this, do they question the fairness of such a system or do they believe it to be superior to other systems?

In my opinion, millibitcoins is just a bit too long for saying it out loud a lot, so we'd need better name for that. And I agree with you that it also could influence buying behavior. People would see the price of 1 bitcoin at 500$ or 1000$ and that might come off as way to expensive to start with, because they don't really realise that's it's OK to buy 0.1 bitcoins as well. It's just easier for people to accept if the value of a currency is somewhat comparable to what they are used to, at least not 500 or 1000 times more...

I'm still looking for a 'real' source on this 'will keep the last x printed pages in non-volatile memory'. I see some random articles on the internet that claim something similar to what you are saying, but they usually refer to network printers. None of them link to a source (preferably a manufacturer of printers for home-use) that show that it actually stores the x last pages that it printed.
Anyway, to say this is a 'very flawed' idea is much too strong I think. You just have to use some cheap offline printer to print your keys. Obviously the idea here is to do things 'offline' so that would include NOT connecting the printer you use(d) for printing keys to a computer which is connected to the internet. If that is mentioned clearly in the guide for this device, then the idea seems fine to me...
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:50:11
I agree with OP. Not saying that the US is not the biggest player with the largest influence on bitcoin (or maybe it isn't I don't know). Anyway, OP didn't say that US laws do not influence bitcoins, it just said that US laws are not applicable outside the US, and that is true. I was also about to post something about it too...
If you look at this post for example, which is now on top: 
I doesn't mention ANYTHING abuot only being applicable to US citizens. It's reported as if these laws are now the universal tax laws on bitcoins.
This happens often. For example, I'm in research myself and a lot of american researches tend to forget that outside the US things might be different. They costantly use US-only abbreviations, talk about laws and education-terms that are only used in the US as if they are universal... P.r.e.t.t.y. annoying... and a little arrogant, although I do not believe it's on purpose...

This is probably a very unpopular opinion, but I do want to see government regulated insured financial institutes which can hold and insure my Bitcoins... for a fee. If I take care of my own wealth in bitcoins, I will always have to be extremely careful to make no mistakes, and if one day I find all my bitcoins are gone, and I don't even know what happened, and there is nobody to go to (except for internet people who will tell me it's my own fault), and no way to get anything back... na I don't think that will be good for my peace of mind. For people who live in countries with very unstable governments and banking systems, I can imagine wanting to secure your own bitcoins, but not here in the Netherlands (or other 'stable' countries). I know that banks are not as secure as my feelings suggest, but still I'm very comfortable leaving my riches at my bank, and if someone hacks my computer and transfers my funds right now, I know that the bank will reimburse me (my aunt lost like 2500 euros and got it all back). I think most people want and need to trust a central government... life is just too complicated without government. I'm not saying this is true for everyone, probably not true for most of the people here, but true for me and true for many others. And yeah... if things go wrong in the whole country, and banks start to fall... well at least we all go down together and can try to find a solution together.

"It's an information network and it's called money, about which we have the most unbelievable superstitions and psychological blocks" 
I recognize this on a daily basis in the discussions on local news sites that report about bitcoin news. People try desperately to 'proof' things about bitcoin and cryptocurrency, by using current economic 'laws'. I can't seem to convince them that most of these 'laws' are only constructed for, and applicable in our current fiat currency situation, and that the fundamental differences between crypto currencies and fiat currencies may render some of these laws obsolete.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:40:26
Yeah I suppose the time and money already spent on bitcoins is incentive for a lot of people to promote, support and develop bitcoin further, which gives it an edge over other currencies. I absolutely agree with you that this new technology (or perhaps its a combination of existing technology that is put together in such a way that something completely new is possible) is extremely exciting, I'm following the developments very closely every day. Unfortunately people I know in real life do not understand or care for bitcoin... yet ;)
