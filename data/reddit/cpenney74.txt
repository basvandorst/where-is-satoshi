Wow. Tell us what else pissues u off. Must be one hell of a list

so.... is there any chance that the avg joe who holds x amount of btc (an controls their keys) could end up losing some / all of their BTC after all this shakes out?  I mean there will be so many people that have no clue about any of this

Why all this talk of selling. I thought bit coin was going to be the currency of the future  why would u sell it for fiat? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:54:32
But why would u sell at any price?
I thought bitcoin was the future?

Yes there definitely is a premium to buy BTC and ETH on Quadriga.  Of course selling is the opposite.
