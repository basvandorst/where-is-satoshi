He made his point in the first comment which is still there mate. Using third parties that convert bitcoin to fiat for retailers isn't independence from fiat at all. 
Whether Shillslayer is against bitcoin or not is irrelevant to the point he is making and you have still refused to address the point he made.

This is one of the most economically illiterate things I've read, I'm sorry. Thank you for writing this.

People here say funny shit and it attracts trolls. The people that almost daily explain using poor or no methodology how they know for certain that bitcoin is going to the moon are hilarious from the outside. The people in the same manner explaining how it will take over the world are hilarious. Then you've got the Internet libertarian factor and the reactions to price changes and people just say really dumb shit here all the time so it's a funny place for people that don't care about bitcoin to read.
EDIT: see comment for an example

But that's exactly what they're doing now

Expressing disagreement is contributing to a conversation and not trolling

But there's no reason for people to do that. Anarchism and anti state sentiment isn't a majority opinion 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:39:15
The end of the state is the topic of discussion and these people are saying that adopting bitcoin en masse is a way to theoretically end the state I think you missed the point.

If you want to get into a masters program use an A paper from your undergrad. I also notice that this doesn't have any academic references? Why is this? You're applying for a masters program you need to show that you have an understanding of the literature in whatever niche you are pursuing. You've just shown that you read bitcoin websites. This isn't a research paper either, you haven't added any new insights to the literature, you haven't conducted your own research. Why not follow a standard academic structure:
Literature Review
This reads like a high school paper I'm sorry but I will be suprised if you are let in to a graduate program with a paper in which you haven't actually done any original research. You've still got enough time to write an actual paper if you work on it everyday.

I edited my response to give you a better example of what I'm talking about. I'm not having a go at you this is just my honest advice. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:46:57
Any time you make a claim about something without stating that it is your opinion or inference from something that was just discussed or without it being your original research or without further explanation (with references) of the reasoning behind the statement you have to back up what you're saying with a reference. Your first paragraph on hyperinflation has no references for example while at the same time making claims about the causes and process of hyperinflation. 
EDIT: Sorry I meant second paragraph on hyperinflation, in that you use phrases like "corrupt" and "short sighted" these are value judgements inappropriate for an academic paper. I'm not sure what level you're at but I'd mark you down heavily for your use of phrasing like this. If you can prove that all actors using QE are objectively short sighted you can say that *with the reference*. If not then rephrase it in a way that gets rid of your baseless value judgement.

Hey mate you're missing a lot of references in this paper. Go back through it and check that you're not making unreferenced claims.
