Really showed me, hahaha!
I'm going to leave now. No point in arguing with a troll, be it you who is trolling or I who is trolling (right now, both).

Ignorance? What ignorance? If it isn't gambling, what are you investing in? What purpose does cryptocurrency **presently** serve? You can buy more things with a Wal-Mart gift card than you can Bitcoin, and that is the most popular among the currencies. So if it sucks as a currency, what is it good for?
So far in my research (which started in like 2012/2013 when it was all the rage among Ron Paul supporters) it hasn't come up as useful. There was a glimmer of hope when Overstock started accepting it, but then pretty much no progress. It is a vastly overinflated commodity, with no real value at all. Even if the USD fell and became worthless, you'd still have some paper to burn for heating. Bitcoin has no value at all, is backed by nothing (the USD has the productivity of the American workforce backing it), and can buy hardly anything with it.
It is, at best, an altruistic investment into something that could become great in the future, and at worst just gambling.
Edit: bolded the important bit.

Did your partner research the subject as it was becoming popular and continue to monitor it for 5 years, or you know, maybe she had neuro-psychology things to do instead?
Come on man, you can clearly, clearly! see that I am not claiming domain knowledge as a result of knowing advanced maths. I am claiming that the knowledge of cryptocurrency is not "beyond me", given I can clearly demonstrate capacities well beyond those necessary to understand cryptocurrency... be honest, are you Dan from HBO? Lol.
I bet you $1k that your partner, given she has demonstrated sufficient intellect by being a professor of neuro-psychology, could learn more about cryptocurrency than you if she had both the motivation and the time. This is because it isn't "beyond her". She just doesn't give a shit to learn about something so trivially obviously useless to her.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:40:56
Dude, you started it, lol! If you can't handle the heat, quit fanning the flame.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:55:42
You said:






So I responded with an obvious indication that no low-level subject like cryptocurrency is going to leave me inadequate to grasp. PDEs is a hell of a lot fuckin' harder to understand. Shit, some basic organic chemistry is harder to understand.
It's almost like you only need a middle school education to understand what a cryptocurrency is, a high school education to understand how it works, and a college education to understand why it would be important if it hit widespread use and is meaningless until then.
Anyone with a 5th grade reading comprehension could see clearly that I made no appeal to authority to establish my understanding of cryptocurrency (you on the otherhand have done so numerous times, oh wise one).
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:49:29
I asked you about what I am ignorant about and you said "you". That's a troll response. You tell me I am so ignorant, so lacking knowledge, but "don't care" and that I should remain ignorant. That is a troll response. Then to finish it off you throw some insults, snark, and proceed to tell me yet again that you have all this knowledge, but you won't share because you don't care. Won't even share where you're spending this bitcoin... trollolol.
Come on man. If you're not a troll, then you're truly completely out of sync with your own ego. You either care and will keep commenting, or you don't and will stop. Pick one, kid.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:35:48
Yeah, I did say that, and there is nothing "pointy-headed git" about it ya twit. I came here because it is fun to see the shitstorm as a fairly respected individual flicks a little shit at someone's beliefs, just as I do when John covers Trump and just as I did when he covered Drones. I was not disappointed with someone so fragile as you coming to the shitstorm, but I was quite surprised that so many people in this subreddit had some actual sanity and correctly gave credit that cryptocurrencies are not 'really' an investment in uncensorable, unprintable currency anymore, there is a ton of scams, and there is a large amount of gambling going on.


Did nothing of the sort.


I am very surprised. In other subreddits they correct you rather than just be a prick.


Don't worry, I know you can't cough up an explanation even if you wanted to.


Yes, you've only said that like a dozen times now. Are you concerned I didn't read it the first time?
Sheesh. I bet you're a ton of fun in the real world and if not a good person at least a decent one. But you gotta work on how you talk to people online, man. If you're not a troll, then I sincerely implore that you learn some etiquette. Right now you just sound like a troll, or maybe like someone who is scared they might have been scammed into gambling, I don't know. All I know is that you wouldn't pass for respectable anywhere around here, so I say again, if you're not trolling, learn to lighten up a bit gramps.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:44:55
Whatever, gramps, lol.
Might be a bit of a prick, but you're still a person. Hope you sleep well! :)
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:06:52
You must be 14.


I'm feckin' dead, bro. Did I accidentally comment in r/xboxlive?
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:40:59
Hahahaha! You're quoting an edit you made after I replied to you?
Nicely played trolling. I mean, seriously, that was almost slick.
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:14:32
Am only here to watch the shitstorm, honestly. Cryptocurrencies are definitely just gambling on humans for when they collectively see that cryptocurrency in the **present** state is worthless for enterprise purposes.
But hey, my mind might change on the matter and I'll invest in it. But until it looks like investment and not gambling, I'm keeping my pocketbook out of it.
Edit: To be entirely clear, I am not ignorant of cryptocurrency. I might have an incomplete understanding, just like an undergraduate student would have an incomplete understanding of a subject. If someone really truly believes Bitcoin is an investment, I am more than willing to hear them out. But I am with John on this one, it looks and smells an awwwful lot like gambling, not investing.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:39:29
I do laugh a lot. The absurdity of this conversation is tickling. I assure you, I am no more scared of you than I am of generic John Smith.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:41:46
Oh yeah, sure. Partial differential equations was easy compared to understanding Bitcoin. Uh-huh. Totally beyond my mental capacity, oh wise one.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:16:46
I want to leave, but you're comedy gold. LOL
You called me a pointy headed git over literally nothing, and I'm supposed to assume you're an adult? I guess not all people grow up to learn manners.
Let us not forget this all started because you wanted to make it onto r/iamverysmart (and I fucking hate that subreddit) by telling me I revel in my ignorance, and lording all this knowledge you don't have over me... pathetic man. Truly pathetic. I think I've said my piece, your trolling is getting weaker and this is losing its charm.
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:28:02


OH!? My bad, I didn't realize this obvious fucking fact. &gt;.&gt;
Go buy some groceries with it, directly, if it is "money".
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:28:07
You not understanding the difference between knowledge and intellect just pains me. There is a very big difference between "you don't know" and "you can't know", you claimed the latter and not the former when you said it was beyond my ability to grasp.
The only two ways I can contrive to disprove your claim is to demonstrate understanding of cryptocurrency, or to demonstrate significant ability to understand. I chose the latter, as it is easier.
Cryptocurrencies can be understood by high school students, as I said. High school students largely have no capacity to understand PDEs. If one can understand something that requires more mental capacity, such as PDEs, then they should have the capacity to understand something simple, like cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are simple (relatively speaking), so I clearly have the ability. I have not proven domain knowledge, I have merely proven the capacity for domain knowledge.

Just makes me think of the character from Remember the Titans. Pivotal individual to winning the game, so thanks? :P
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:51:39
So, rather than comment a store to put your money where your mouth is, you just claim I "know nothing about bitcoin"? Yeah, you totally showed me!
God, you guys are giving me such kicks! Hahaha
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:36:08
Right... what store?
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:27:03
My eyes cannot roll any harder.
There are less than 30 million users of Bitcoin world-wide, I *highly* doubt you can buy "anything". Can you pay your power bill in Bitcoin? Taxes? Mortgage? I'm not talking whether it is theoretically possible sometime in the future, I mean right now. Can you go to a car dealership and use Bitcoin?
This is the difference between a currency and not a currency. A currency can buy anything, because everyone accepts it. With less than 30 million users world-wide, significantly less than 10% of Americans have a wallet for you to make an exchange, so in the VAST majority of cases you will need to first convert your BTCs into FRNs.
A GOOD currency has many other properties, too. For instance, the value is nearly constant day to day. I don't have to worry that my $100 FRN will be worth less the next day. This is true for any realistic currency.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:31:02
How many times do I have to say that I do not think it is just gambling?
I swear to god, it's like people are reading my comments and overlaying comments of dissent from yesteryear that I am not making.
*At worst* it is just gambling. This is a fact. It is probably not just gambling, there are many potential uses for Bitcoin that I am excited for if it should finally get into the direct transaction market at major retailers (it is the basically the equivalent of credit cards that you can't use anywhere; eventually gonna be super awesome, but right now useless). A currency it is not, which is the supposed purpose of Bitcoin. Currently, it is a gambling market. The reason why all these offshoots came into existence is because Bitcoin has begun approaching convergence, so the risk of major losses is reduced but so is the possibility of major gains.
If you're putting money into Bitcoin on the hope it makes it to mass-market as an established currency, that is an investment. An incredibly risky investment, but an investment. If you're putting money into Bitcoin, hoping it will go up in value enough to trade it back more money than you put in, then you're just gambling. I contend that the latter is far more common than the former. That is all.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:20:02
Other than your first point, those sound less like purposes and more like features. Like, the FRN serves as a lightweight means of carrying value with you... that's a feature of the FRN, but the purpose is to make direct purchases and sales easier by exchanging it for perceived equivalent value in products and services. If Bitcoin were accepted everywhere, it would be a real currency.
*Presently*, Bitcoin can almost exclusively be exchanged for FRN or other currencies. It can't really be used as a currency itself except in very select cases, in which case you might as well call anything a currency, which defeats the purpose of having the descriptive term in the first place.
I feel like everyone here thinks I want Bitcoin to fail. I don't. I would love to see it be a wild success for a global currency. But to call it a currency right now, and to call it primarily an investment, is just silly. It is primarily a gambling market right now, and waaay overinflated considering its real purchasing power.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:11:11
I have a very fair understanding of what Bitcoin is, and no offense but your tiny little art sales accepting bitcoin hardly makes it a strong currency. It is factually primarily a gambling commodity right now.
I don't recall saying it was "*strictly*" gambling. What I said was that at worst it is just gambling.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:04:00


Ain't like you gave me much of an option as seen by the following quote, lol. ;)


Stay classy. Adios to you, self-proclaimed Mr. Super Old guy with kids older than myself, who, even though he's apparently an old guy, loves to lord his apparent superior knowledge over others by keeping it to himself. I will remember you as a lesson in how not to act. Toodles. :)
