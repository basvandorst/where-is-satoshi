Just a correcture due to the immense rise the last days. Ist was expectable and only natural :)

Thanks stranger xD Didn’t expect a tip for this comment but...yeah :)

In the past I heard that you can find interesting news and stuff about Bitcoin on this subreddit.
So that was a fucking lie
@_date: 2019-08-20 17:45:49
With quantum computers you can indeed encrypt the cryptography behind Bitcoin, however, then the cryotography can adapt to that and also uses quantum technology. Basically it’s just an update and there is now need to worry about

Also Bitcoin is one of the few coins which reached a true form of decentralization while many many altcoins dont have and idea how this could be achieved. And centralized coins are possible scams as you already mentioned

Damn, looks intense :D. Hope one day I‘ll get on your level.
Mine is pretty...basic ^^ But it works somehow
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:43:54
And you have to have in mind that Bitcoin has a far less risk than small altcoins

Yeah, I can put it on GitLab on Monday :)
It’s quite a simple one, and surely it’s not the cleanest code, but hey it’s a start :D
I did it in C# btw

What exactly do you mean with multiply? I can only think of mining, which isn’t profitable for the average person, and of Bitcoin lending, which still has some problems.
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:24:49
Oh yeah, had a mistake in my thinking. Thanks :)
(Just programmed my first Blockchain today, so I wasn’t sure right now how it’s handled ^^)
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:11:49
Interesting...Still have much to learn in the blockchain universe :) Thanks
I‘m planing on becoming a blockchain or dapp Developer in the future ^^ I‘m 17 right now so I hope in the next years I can learn as much about this topic as possible.

Btw, don’t share your transactions that publicly, it reveals what your public address is, and with that how much BTC you own. Kinda destroys an important detail of blockchain ^^
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:41:15
Your fee was 
0.00000472 BTC just as it’s written in the transaction
@_date: 2019-12-27 08:32:11
Good question, spending could be made possible via Lightning network, which is basically already happening to decrease transaction fees.
Mining is a bigger problem, that’s true. Right out of the head I don’t have a proper solution for it, but I‘m certain the community would find a way if it’s needed. I could imagine that you send the informations of one transaction to all devices near you (for example via bluetooth). These devices do the same until it finally reaches a miner, who then can confirm your transaction. However, this would be restricted due to the limited range of Bluetooth. Maybe in the future when there are more devices who can actively do all of this with peer to peer it could be possible.
However, as I already said I don’t think this scenario is likely. Most governments are pro Bitcoin anyway :)
@_date: 2019-12-28 08:21:59
Yeah I heard of that, did they actually finish the project? I‘m not up to date on that.

If the whole internet was shut down, you could keep the blockchain via peer to peer of digital devises.
If Bitcoin was declared as „illegal“ it would be really hard to actually do this. Ok, there are some ways to get to the identity of the wallet owner with assumptions or datas of centralized platforms. However, even if Bitcoin owners would be revealed, you could move to security token like Monero or Zcash and with that make it basically impossible to find out who’s behind the address.
Don’t worry to much about the security, as long as there are humans and computers who wants to keep Bitcoin alive the blockchain will survive.
