Do you own a CD payable in Obamascript? 
What's the  expected minimal loss, best case?
What's the worst case expected loss?

Best practice is a new public address for each transaction, no other user should have the address.

As Bitcoin is presented on each talk show an 'Oprah' approach would be possible. A special purpose fountain could make small payouts to staff and audience. 
A localbitcoins sponsored cash transaction with the host would be interesting.

"rewarded for bad decisions."
Bad banks , like BOA and The Fed, are simply large piles of bad decisions and bad bankers. 
All of their decisions are bad judged as a set of steps towards insolvency , the subset that could have saved the bank have no value for shareholders if the bank fails.

Current CD rates of -.6% (inflation and tax adjusted)  are too low for them to be a rational choice, you never know for a fact that you will not be using the funds early because the future is unknowable.

Decentralization, the network is P2P like bittorrent.
E-gold was a database entry listing who owned the gold in vaults, so once the Feds seized the servers and the gold that was the end.

That's a reply with no content, defending  an obsolete, underperforming, overmarketed,  pointless, returnless, obsolete and uninteresting financial instrument purchased by unthinking drones with no capacity to receive, discuss or give financial advice.

The reward is that bad executives at bad banks kept their jobs and their banks kept existing, making future bonuses possible.
Mtgox may never pay future bonuses, this is better because they were never well run. The average existing Bitcoin exchange is now better because we are deleting the worst.

Exchanges so far tend to loose about 1% of your coins per day, so no coins should ever be stored there for more than a 48 hours.
More advanced exchange technology based on multi-sig will eliminate coin storage as an exchange function.

CDs are a relic of previous times when banks paid significant interest. Taking the current risk of losing .6% of your money while holding Obamascript during this crisis is foolish.
Thinking you  "do know they won't be using the funds early" is hubris.
Remember we are in the bail-in era,  the NSA and the FDIC reserve the right to adjust you bank balances down as desired.

Who has less respect for the CD buyers than the taxpayer funded bank's marketing .05% to them as something they should be stupid enough to notice?
 I try but I'm not sure words can match that spittle-font offer.

No, they may have internal or external hackers looking over your files.

Each day your coin is on an external server you run a 1% risk of losing it, so don't leave them there for more than the few hours required for your transaction.
Here's how exchanges will work in the future...
