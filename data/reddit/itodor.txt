We need map which will show (BTC bought + sold) / (number of inhabitants per country). That would show the real acceptance of the BTC per country.

Do you really think that anyone who has not a bank account has a technology to securely use Bitcoin? This un-banked madness has to stop, it's not useful for the Bitcoin, it just makes people laugh at how detached from reality those who talked about it are.

I would love to see any explanation about this mysterious transactions, conspiracy theories included.
Also would be interesting to know the IP address of this new pool. It's hard to believe someone completely unknown quickly goes into double-digit network percentage territory at todays difficulty.

It may be surprising, but yes, it's more or less standardized, sha256(passphrase) is an entry point to ECDSA key generation. It's been suggested that using other algo, or more iterations of sha256, may be beneficial for additional security, but all public tools like brainwallet.org use one iteration of sha256.

Who says I'm not using that passphrase? I can not do anything with my wallet without it, whenever I want to send any transaction I must type it in the UI. I've typed it so many times that I'm almost certain I'll remember it any case but the late stage of the Alzheimers.

@_date: 2014-08-14 11:24:30
Yes, and that's good because "others" want to pay for good public transportation so there would be less traffic on the street, reduced pollution and overall nicer place to live in. Good public transportation can not be paid by those who actually use it, it's been tried million times and always ended as disaster which people use only if they absolutely have to and revert to individual transportation. The only rational solution that make everyone happy is that public transportation is paid by everyone, regardless if they use it or not, just to make their habitat better.

It's ignored because using it can be dangerous due to much lower entropy than any decent RNG. It's not obvious that it has claimed 66 bits of entropy, and even if it does I wonder why would anyone use this instead of good old RNG? You have to wright down the private key in both cases, and the other private key is obviously stronger.

There's one thing often neglected, bounty address can be compressed or (usually) uncompressed. You know that each passphrase generates two valid BTC addresses, right?
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:07:46
The OP is advertising the BIP0038, which is complicated scrypt protocol not allowing more then few tries a second. It is that protocol's main strength. In my book, it's lame to advertise it this way instead explaining to people why that option is better than regular brainwallet. BTW, all brainwallets, including BIP0038, are bad idea.
@_date: 2014-11-24 10:26:44
This is just a theory, if there would be a hint that successful attack on bitcoin public key exists the whole system would be in danger. I agree that exposing hash only instead of public key is safer, but exposing public key is indescribably safer than actually moving funds from one address to another.
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:17:29
The better term may be 'masking the passphrase' or even better 'mutating the passphrase'. Salt is usually expected to be exposed/public, for example the system that you try to login sends you the salt over communication channel and expects you to add that salt to your password, hash it, and send the resulting hash back to the system. It compares that hash with previously stored one and if it matches lets you log on the system. This way password never travels over communication channel and can not be intercepted. That's what geeks understand 'salt' to be.

It has nothing to do with science, it's common sense deeply embedded in people who live in the metric part of the globe (wast majority BTW). I can show you 1 meter with my hands with minimal error, few percentages at the most. Also when I walk from one place 1000 m (1 km) I can tell you roughly (with error, ofc) when I got there. Going to the other direction - anyone can draw you 1/1000 part of the meter (1 mm) with extreme accuracy. I bet bigger percentage of metric people can draw 1/1000 m on the paper with good accuracy than percentage of imperial unit people can draw accurately 1" on the paper.
Metric is easy, intuitive. Add/remove three zeros. Nothing to get confused about. Those eight zeroes Satoshi put in the BTC after decimal point are there for a reason. He would put more than eight there, but that would induce bigger headache implementing point calculations in the software, so he had to stop at eight. Please leave those zeroes alone.

Exactly, except you don't have to trust the persons you've emailed the wallet to, they can't use it without the passphrase. I've mailed my encrypted wallet to myself, so it's safe until Google Mail exists as a service, which should be very long time. I've seen people who claimed they've mailed it to Barack Obama, which is also a good option, it's in your Sent mail folder forever. This is infinitely more secure than any brainwallet or similar scheme people often use.

The answer is simple: Manufacturers can always sell the ASICs for more BTC than they can mine with them. People don't understand how diminishing returns work, and are willing to overpay for the miner. Why would manufacturers keep them in that situation?
@_date: 2014-01-22 13:46:12
It's selfish mining. They are finding a block but not publishing it immediately, it can be seen by the regularity in their block found times, there's no usual variance there. Maybe this will teach them it is not so successful tactics as they thought.

There's no need to double encrypt. Bitcoin-QT encryption is so strong nobody is even close to breaking it. Even if there would be some mysterious hackers in the future who would be able to do it, they would first have to get hold of my GMail account (2FA protected) and then get my encrypted wallet to try something on it. You'll agree it's extremely unlikely that all these conditions would be met. Security provided this way sure beats stupid brainwallets which many people use for reasons which I don't understand.

That library has x86 assembly code in it, so it won't work on RPi.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:12:20
Because printed wallets are bad idea. Prone to destruction, and easy to steal.If you make several copies to reduce accidental loss or destruction, you increase the chance someone can steal it from you. Go with encrypted digital wallets, keeping them in several places still makes them thief-safe.

Almost certain this is not one bot bug, most likely two bots got into some interlocked state regarding their algorithms. One of them will run out of BTC soon.

baillou2, stop using word 'salt' in this context, it pisses geeks so much because 'adding salt' in geekspeak means almost the opposite of what you've done. Adding salt always means changing the length of the passphrase by adding more characters, while you are not adding anything to it. There's no technical term for this kind of riddles because changing the passphrase this way is almost never used in everyday practice, it's hard to formalise the rules like yours. It's much easier to add salt, meaning adding another random string to existing passphrase.

The answer is easy: 123456 
Wallet encryption password is tied to an instance of the wallet.dat file. You can have 10 identical wallets regarding the Bitcoins they contain with 10 different encryption passwords, each copy of a file having it's own password.

I don't want to hide that my BTC wallet is there stored. I've said it publicly here, I've said it dozens of times on bitcointalk, people have my email address. Even if Google employee or some hacker that knows me get's my wallet he can not do anything with it, it's encrypted. That under assumption that Google has corrupt employees checking other people email for private agenda, which may not be true. That's the beauty of the system I propose, first Google protects you from the rest of the world with 2FA, and even if that fails (it won't), laws of math protect you with wallet encryption. Conclusion: there's no need for additional layer of encryption, one is enough.

I like your approach, that's why I think it makes sense you try compressed again with the dictionary before quitting. One other thing - only 3000 words added in last 30 years seams way to low, double check that. I would expect an order of magnitude more words added considering the changes in technology, etc.

I think he is anonymous to protect his baby, Bitcoin, and to protect his future wealth. By connecting S.N. to a real person Bitcoin gets a attack vector, discredit Satoshi and you've discredited the Bitcoin. This way it's safer, at least until Bitcoin passes a point of no return, when nothing can stop it.

Many people were wrong claiming the system would not work. If Satoshi haven't had the software already up and running, they might also have made him believe that ;)
