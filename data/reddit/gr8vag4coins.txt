Listen buddy, a true bitcoin believer would never sell bitcoins.  A  bitcoiner who truely believes bitcoin is the future will only earn income in bitcoins and trade bitcoins for goods/services.  
Protip: everyone here is a "believer" because they are crossing their fingers and hoping in the long term (3-5years), those coins will be worth wayyy more than the cost of aquiring them now.

Well I agree that bitcoin is probably not going to be the one currency to rule them all.  But there is an online need for a cash like instrument, and right now that is bitcoin.
To me, bitcoin is just a tool for transmitting money online, just like PayPal.  Bitcoin and paypal each have their own distinct advantages and will probably co-exist.  For example my last btc purchase was for a VPN service.  A prepaid debit card may have been able to do the same thing, but BTC was way more convenient and didn't even have to put pants on!  Paypal generally leans on the side of the buyer, and bitcoin is on the side of the seller.  Guess it just depends on if the product is a buyers or sellers market
The bonus part is that a lot of people use btc as an investment.  Personally I don't, that is not my intention.  However the btc that i do have may make me rich one day so no point in selling or donating it away.  The downside is your initial capital but with unlimited upside, and with the large amounts of bitcoin evangilists out there, a single individual does not really need to do anything.

I'd be very cautious before throwing money away on Xapo's insurance.  According to their faq, they are self insured.  Then they list other companies that are self insured (presumably to build rapport), but those other companies are nothing like Xapo.

Ship home, ship to work, ship to neighbors or shell businesses.  Since you're looking for high value easy to ship items, the vendor wouldn't really need to do this often. Only profit needs to be cashed out, the rest used to pay suppliers. 
Might be a better question to ask the pros on darknetmarkets.
Not saying it's a bad thing, I just believe the black markets are still a driving force behind our economy just as in the times of the silk road.

I wouldn't characterize it as a flashcrash.  Over the last month, the price of shares has been steadily declining.  I
I thought that the value at the IPO may have been a bit high for a company without any actual products yet, so i reasoned the steady decline in share value to be okay.  
The issue is not so much the price decline, but that trading has been halted due to "abnormal activity", and there hasn't been a response from Neo and Bee.  Please don't use the arguement that they are busy.  This is a big deal for them and even busy startups understand that companies with nothing to hide would educate the public immediately on what's going on

The story is his business is paying too much in paypal fees. However, instead of implementing bitcoin for the business paying too much fees, he's opened a new online sex shop and only accepts bitcoin.

What solution would you suggest?
Just because you borrow at 0%, doesn't mean you're going to lend at 0%..... revenue is needed to pay operating expenses and employees. 
I suppose you could nationalize these banks, and have a government agency administer, service, and originate loans.... but good luck getting support for nationalizing the industry.  We have enough headaches with the DMV as it is, not sure if we want to extend it any further.  
Another alternative could be to force companies in these industries to operate non-for-profit, with hard salary caps and transparent audits.  Hopefully this would force additional profit to be reinvested into better technology and infrastructure instead of paying for Jamie Dimon's next vacation home.

Classic guberment. 
Once bitcoin made a lot of people money besides a handful of neckbeards and when it went into the 200s, and then into 1k late last year, the regulators are trying to get their hands into our pockets. 
They claim it is for our saftey, and maybe it is. But the truth is scams happen with SEC approved investment funds to this day and we don't see the guberment covering our losses there. 
We did fine without regulation before and will continue to do our thing and use bitcoin for our purposes without it.

Obviously the idea is that paying through coinbase will appreciate the value of bitcoin. 
I  not sure if it true or not in practice.  Late adopters help early adopters by paying more for a bitcoin, so in return early adopters should be the ones paying the coinbase expense. This is how a fair world might work. However in the real world, late adopters get the short end of the stick and need to do both jobs.
Essentially, it is the duty of the latest purchaser to sell and promote the idea of bitcoin to the next new individual. The person before you sold you on the idea and brought a new person on board, so their job is done if they want. Now it is your responsibility to spread bitcoin and bring the next wave of adopters in. Some people believe coinbase and their repurchase program is one way of achieving this. Only time will tell if it works or not...

Last thanksgiving I tried to buy a flat screen TV online. The price was wayyy lower than everywhere else but the site looked mildly professional. I felt is was a 50 50 chance of scam, so I used my credit card.  
Received the order confirmation but after 2 weeks, there was still no tracking info and support wouldn't reply to emails. Called my credit card company and had the transaction reversed within minutes. 
In my opinion credit cards are really the only way to buy online without having to trust the merchant. Any other form of payment would have been irreversible and left me scammed.

Well, the acceptance of "bitcoin" by larger companies like newegg, dell, expedia, etc has been made possible by bitpay and coinbase. 
By using these payment processors, the individual bitcoiner is helping these companies profit and hopefully enable them to have the funds needed to sell more companies on bitcoin. 
Additionally, everyone knows the crux of coinbase's business is to act as a bitcoin broker. The other services such as repurchase, wallet, vault, etc were added later in response to user demand. 
I remember years ago one of the few ways to get bitcoins besides mining was to send a money order to an international address and cross your fingers hoping n you wouldn't get scammed. The only thing that helped you sleep at night were forum posts of anonymous users saying they didn't get scammed.  Recently coinbase came in and allowed US purchasers to have a reasonable assurance that they weren't being scammed. This has always been the flagship product of coinbase.  They are a bitcoin broker.

Why would hackers want to destroy bitcoin??  
Do you think all of the hacked bitcoins have been echanged for fiat?  Because if they haven't, the incentive to keep price up the bitcoins they've already stole, outweighs the potential gain of crashing bitcoin, and also somehow hacking the trading accounts of people that are shorting in order to withdraw the cash into their accounts. 
Anyways, stolen bitcoins equate to 100% profit so it doesn't matter what the price is.   If hacking thus far has been successful for those criminals, I don't see why they would dedicate the hard work and time into trying to destroy bitcoin.  If the community just keeps innovating and buying, all the hackers have to do is just keep stealing and selling slowly at a time.

I remember it from the terms of service agreement, although the language is not as obvious.  One thing to remember is that coinbase is not technically an exchange, but rather a bitcoin broker.

Baby steps.  It takes time to integrate into the supply chain.
Back when the silk road started out, vendors would also convert their btc to local currency on sale through mtgox.  After some time, some vendors would be able to keep a larger portion of their sales revenue in btc and pay their suppliers. The same idea applies to legal merchants like newegg... it's just that the vertical integration of btc may have been quicker for SR vendors.
The question is would you rather have merchants accept btc through bitpay or coinbase, or not have them at all?

With bitcoin you just feel more helpless when mistakenly being less secure online, even if  unknowingly one time, and a human on the other side of the planet pick pockets you.

It's a virus that encrypts files on the infected machine and as of right now, the only way to decrypt the hostaged data is by sending bitcoins to the address it tells you...
Even police departments have paid the ransom to get their data back, but to this day the origins of the virus and who is profiting is unknown. 
Btw, please don't say this can be done with cash too.
With the current system we already know who the crooks are, just can't do much about it. With bitcoin we're welcoming the unknown unknown

Here's a great idea honey, how about for our anniversary we travel to some 3rd world nation with economic sanctions from the US, where we can shit in holes in the ground and really spice up our relationship.
Not sure what an OFAC list is, but if you're on it then there's probably a good reason why.
The truth is bitcoin is solving a problem in the frontier markets but is far less needed in the developed world.  The majority of adoption is driven by the U.S. and Europe, and is seen as an investment product.

Fair enough, I can appreciate the laziness.  For the ultra lazy, look into free bill pay with your bank.
True story: The other day i owed money to a friend but was too lazy to hit up the ATM.  So instead i logged into Bank of America online account, entered by buddy's address, and the bank sent a printed check on my behalf directly to my buddy.  It took a few days to arrive in the mail, but there were no fees or postage.  Some may be put off by the time it took in transit, but the few days are no different than waiting for an exchange or broker like coinbase to transfer funds to your bank account.
In the past I have only used Bill Pay to legitimate bills.  One day, i tried it for rent to pay my landlord, and it worked!  Now i use Bill Pay for everything.  The longest part of the process is waiting for that damn 2FA text message...  Many banks even allow deposits to be done through apps on the phone so the receiver doesn't even have to get their lazy butts to the bank either!  
And get this, some banks even allow Bill Pay to send a check to the receiver's bank and auto deposit into their checking accounts.... no joke!  I usually do this to pick up all of those promotional deals like open a checking account and get free $200 or something like that.  They always require to set up direct deposit or bill pays or some combination of each to qualify, so i just have a bunch of linked scheduled bill pays from one account to another, and get all the promotional awards :).  By the way that last part was a protip so don't go around telling too many people.
Bill Pay is a great way to get around the fees bank charge for bank-to-bank transfers (usually charged when the sending and receiving banks are different firms).

Received a letter in the mail a month or 2 later from the credit card company saying the investigation is over and the credit was a done deal.  Didn't even have to talk to any real people.

But anyways like i said before i liked bitcoin because its a cash like instrument for the internet.

However thanks to the many btc evangelists, the value of my remaining coins now is far to great to be used for donating or buying stuff without immediately replacing.

I am still convinced that the majority of merchant purchases to places like Newegg and dell are placed by black market vendors as an alternative to cashing out. It is well known that large volume vendors have a tough time cashing out. 
It would be interesting to see a study comparing the number of new ebay listings for high value easy to ship items with the dates when Newegg, dell, and other merchants started accepting bitcoin. I am convinced that the bitcoiners with the most to gain from new merchants accepting bitcoin are the black market vendors.  With order books on current exchanges as thin as they are and the trend for AML/KYC policies, cashing out by reselling products seems to be one of the best alternatives to localbitcoin

The down sizing has already begun as many departments are moved to low cost centers (i.e. Utah, Buffalo, Florida, Bangalore).  By the end of the decade I think only investment banking and some sales &amp; trading will be left on wall street.  The rest will be given a choice to either move to a low cost center or a GTFO pink slip.
However I don't think it's driven by P2P finance but rather a lack of opportunities to exploit right now.  As the credit cycle shifts and we have to play defensive, jobs nationwide will be lost but i just don't understand how bitcoin fits in to "free" people.

Banks are not the only industy to consolidate.  There are plenty of examples but the first off the top of my head is the airline industry in recent years.
Essentially this is part of the business cycle.  Profit margins are squeezed tight and players either go bankrupt and get bought up, or simply merge with competitors.  As the industry  moves to consolidate (as seen in your chart), profit margins generally increase.  In terms of price collusion, it is much easier to have a price leader in an industry with fewer number of participants.  As profit margins rise, there is opportunity for new entrants..... and the cycle repeats.  One of the few things stopping complete consolidation into the hands of just one or two players are anti-trust laws.
In bitcoin's case, no regulation means only market forces drive participant's behavior.  Adjusting mining difficulty is a great mechanism, but unfortunately does not protect in all cases.  For example, a new mining operator with very deep pockets can enter the industry, and raise difficulty levels to a level where it is completely infeasible to run a profitable mining operation.  This new company will run in the red for as long as it takes until the other participants can no longer operate and drop out.  
This new monopolistic mining pool would have to operate in a country with no anti-trust laws.  I am not sure what exactly it would mean to have such a large player, or if a 51% attack could be made into a profit model, but it probably isn't good.

Obviously we can't be sure what their reason was... but doing business with someone like you exposes them to greater headline risk.  Cumulatively,  billions of dollars per year are spent on managing headline risk.
For example, a video of the CEO of Centerplate went viral recently showing a man kicking his dog in an elevator.  Although very messed up, the CEO thought he had privacy and did not imagine those actions having such an impact on the business.
I don't really understand what you're business is, but based on your website and comments here, the marginal headline risk from adding you as a customer might just not be worth it to them.

Cash for birthdays is generally considered thoughtless by our culture... but cash for weddings is actually becoming preferred by many couples. High end weddings for the middle class can cost around 50k, and the last thing couples need is another set of expensive wine glasses, etc.  
Many couples nowadays prefer cash to help them recoup wedding expenses or use as a down payment on their baby making house.
However bitcoins are not seen by many as a cash substitute,  but rather equivalent to a Walmart gift card with the added disadvantage of having to learn about how to use the darn things...

Technically Google is one of the most innovative and cash rich countries in the world... I'm sure they could monitor the ads if they needed

As a LBC merchant, I would be very interested in learning the details myself

Well I like it because it is online cash. It garantees no refunds so I use it when I want to sell something. Also use it to buy stuff when I do not trust the merchant with my personal info. These are the only times so far that I've had a real need for it, and use the cc for everyday purchases.

Sure, how about finally charging bitcoins for deepthroating?

The terminal is a pretty decent product, along with their excel Add-in.  Bloomberg covers a very broad range of financial products, pretty decent coverage, and has a strong network effect.  
Bloomberg isn't only for data either.  It has order management systems, individual security calculators, and most importantly a glorified instant messenger which is the industry standard for connecting the buy and sell sides.  Finally, Bloomberg also allows their customers to put up their own pages on the terminal which they can permission and charge for separately.
Essentially it is a jack of all trades, but its usually better to also get specialized tools for specific asset classes/purposes, in addition to bloomberg.  Btw 24k/year is nothing when you have to pay a 1st year analyst an average of 65k/year + bonus + payroll overhead, and that person is basically useless their first yto the team

I cannot envision a world where the finance sector is replaced by block chains... but can definitely see bitcoin and banks co existing as long as the consumer has the final choice

Some of us are using it as an asset class.  
OP, you are spending for our hodling sins.

Could you explain what is level one and 2 security?  Not really sure what is meant by this.
For instance, if I'm at work and an awesome deal comes up, is there a way to purchase with bitcoin, while still maintaining some security?  I'm thinking at least 1k need to bee ready for spending at any time
