why is everyone such an expert on this board?  It is hard to trust anybody's opinion at all.

Its friday.  what do you say?
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:33:40
Goodnight. God bless.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:41:55
what does this mean?
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:25:29
how is everyone so sure that that it is a good time to buy?  I may be uneducated but there is always a risk and you never hear about it here.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:50:29
Debit card.  Makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:03:47
is this going to go to $10,000 after the dip?
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:27:36
When do you check in on pricing usually?  It makes me feel bipolar given the dearth of info and volatility.  Its lil I have no control.
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:52:57
I dont understand how you know to trust comments on this board.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:24:47
Stupid. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:00:44
So wtf is an alternative for little fee? Geez.
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:21:58
I'm appreciative.  But, I thought it weird that people were buying on credit.  Its a hard notion to believe.  Leaps of faith are difficult.  Most people are conspiracy theorists and who wouldn't engender a thought that bankers wouldn't be able to shut it down.  Feels foolish to have spent weekends during the main crash watching prices and doing nothing.  Caution won me alot of downbites, then.
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:53:47
Is anyone reluctant?  
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:40:45
You only made money if you bought an extensive amount, though.

Sounds outrageous.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:01:59
This is ludicrous.  How does everyone here buy this info?
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:52:39
There are traders who still believe that the govt. Will not allow bitcoin to grow because I poses a risk to the world bank.  They always sing the same tune.

@_date: 2017-10-11 17:43:25
There's no way to make a quick buck, you are too late for that.  Weekends are volatile-if you time it right, you can take advantage of 200-400 dollar variances.   with the little you are paying in you'll only be making a few dollars.  Really you need to be trading with five thousand to make a few hundred.

I received BTC to post this!

Its very difficult to understand the instructions on how to do that.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:58:00

Well I am happy that is the case.  I thought FOMO was a bad thing.  I'm late, obviously.  Just was skiddish of all of the volatility.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:44:48
this is a dumb meme.
Anyway, I did purchase at 3500 but why was that considered a good move as the price can fall.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:09:00
Why?  If it goes to 10k in5 years he only made double profit.

What makes you so sure this isa good idea?
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:42:52
Yeah, I figured as much given your BK address.  I believe that stiff upper lip culture you mention can occasionally lead to an identity crisis.  I thought of the many cons of crypto first and foremost, which inhibited decision making.  Here we have the entire world running around promoting crypto and all I can think of is that someone will be left holding the bag.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:53:09
Yes.

Meaning what exactly?   early on it seems odd, but now we are past the threshold of pump and dump.  Yes, everyone acts as an expert which can be hard to fathom at times, but overall I'm ok w it, mostly.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:42:07
