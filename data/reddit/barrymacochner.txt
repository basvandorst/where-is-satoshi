The worst part for me, I don't get paid til friday and it will have probably recovered by then.

Thank you for answering another question I hadn't asked yet.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:42:37
tbh, most people, want to help other people.   don't hold the hate.   not everyone is out to hurt you.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:28:41
how do they figure in the value with as much variation as it has?  (btc and other crypto's)
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:46:55

It's not really horrible allocation of resources though, Not sure what's gonna work to get your desired result.  Brute force it with everything you got.  It's not like they're ever really held responsible for wasting time or money.

I wish I could afford to buy a couple, Where I live my power is included in my rent.  Even just letting 1 run would eventually be worth it.

I look at it as going out to dinner when I buy.   That’s money I’m not getting back.
If I can’t  afford to use that money to go out to eat I can’t afford to buy in at that time.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:33:54
Buy smaller, consider it spent like you went out for dinner.   Forget you have it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:56:02
Yay we’re down to 10.7k quick buy cheap.
If you wanted to buy the dip this is it.   Going up from here.

Pay her to ship it?
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:25:38
This is why dca is a good strategy, small amount often but still keep enough cash that you have it for emergencies.  
My 401k hasn’t done much lately so I dropped my contribution 5% and use that to buy btc every check.
I basically consider it spent when I buy, like if I’d gone out to dinner for an evening.  I’m not getting that money back.

When you sell for a profit it counts as capital gains.  Which you are taxed on.  
Unless you’re selling locally for cash it’s tracked on every exchange that operates in the US.  And transactions over 10k are required to be reported to the IRS.

Can we edit out my face?   I'd prefer no one know's I'm hodling anything.

And cap gains taxes are gonna screw him if he isn't careful or paying attention to it.
Oh that's why he pays a financial advisor you might say.   
Yeah, that's never fucked anyone over in the past.
