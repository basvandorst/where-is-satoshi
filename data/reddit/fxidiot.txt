Well I just bought some stuff from [Overstock with BTC](  You should buy something also and show everyone that this is a good thing.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:31:14


The minimum deposit is $10 USD worth of Bitcoins on Microsoft billing.  Right now that is about 0.03 BTC. 
For 12 Months worth of Xbox Live Gold, its about 0.17 BTC right now
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:10:41
Umm looks like a good way for them to sell your email and have tons of spam sent to you
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:53:51
Agreed, BTC.SX has the worst trading engine when it comes to Bitcoin. Although their support did reset my 2 factor auth when I ask them to.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:02:32
Hey thanks!! Its my first ever tip.  Im so happy :D

I'm buying some just because of the effort that community has put into this fun cryptocurrency.

Good news for BTCe

@_date: 2015-01-25 21:59:07
They got me
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:14:16
Also, I'm guessing that Coinbase is going to allow limit orders in 25 states in the USA.  Basically they will allow some trading on Coinbase for us citizens.  NOTE THIS IS MY GUESS BASED ON RUMORS
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:20:21
My target is $200 - $135.  This is my opinion. I'm going all in if we get this low
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:12:17
Dam, what is it?!
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:26:42
I never got a tip before.... :D  THANKS MAN  
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:08:20
Is the Tether crash causing this?
@_date: 2016-11-14 03:32:28
I sold one of mine on Ebay for $1800. [I still have one and I'm not going to get rid of it.](  I bet once BTC starts making new highs you will start seeing them online.

I turned my Raspberry Pi into a simple moving average crossover bot using Python.  [Here it is trading BTC/LTC on Poloniex](  I do not live trade with it because I prefer to have my bots running on server and not my home wifi.
@_date: 2017-04-18 17:53:57
That's what it looks like.  He will probably come up with some bs excuse saying he is testing them before shipping them out.  Only this test will last as long as it take to bring Segwit signaling down.
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:24:36
I've been using Coinbase since day 1 and the only issue I had was one of my bank transfers never went through and this was due to high traffic maintenance.  I was able to call them and talk to someone on the phone and they fixed my issue.  The last time I tired support I got a automated response that did not solve my issue.  They are way bigger now then they were in 2013 which is why I see some post complaining about customer service.  I also use their trading exchange Gdax and never had an issue.  I do recommend looking at Kraken and Gemini for trading because I enjoy trading there as well.  Realistically Coinbase makes everything very convenient when dealing with Bitcoin.  Before I had to go to Walmart and use a MoneyGram with Bitinstant just to purchase this cool new currency I just learned of.
@_date: 2017-04-09 19:52:19
Can someone link a eli5 on how to do this?

They convert the btc to cash via bitpay
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:26:20
Gdax was giving me bad/glitched data today.  I wrote a script that plots the bids, ask, and mean of the real-time price
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:51:34
Are you on a mobile device?  The link should work
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:24:14
~~No, but~~  ~~you can buy a Vive with Bitcoin on Steam.~~  Much better in my own opinion.
Edit: I forgot you can buy amazon giftcards with Bitcoin
Edit2:  I guess steam redirects you to its re sellers when buying the Vive.... You can still buy games with BTC. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 03:24:52
Thanks! Tired doing this myself recently and gave up...
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:00:24
Why do people flock to shady exchanges for crypto? Mtgox, Bitfinex, Binance....
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:09:13
Is Trezor just as good as Ledger in your opinion? I get worried because these devices are probably made in China and could have malicious hardware. [For example, Amazon's chips we're bugged](
@_date: 2018-12-25 02:30:51
Cool, did not know that!
@_date: 2018-12-22 19:24:10
Thanks for the explanation! 
@_date: 2017-07-13 02:42:29
Gdax was giving me bad data today. So I wrote a script that plots the streaming ticker data so it can be analyzed in real-time

@_date: 2013-03-30 04:17:32
Same here.  Have they not implement it yet?
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:43:50
Set up a website, sell things, and install Bitpay.  Buy your own products. :D
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:32:48

Thank you for the cheap coins!

They always seem overpriced? 
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:24:02
A 8-character code is visible on the hologram. This is the first eight characters of the Bitcoin address assigned specifically to the coin. You can verify the coin's balance on by typing this code into the blockchain. This coin uses uses the ["minikey“ private]( key format for legitimacy.  As far as the Casascius coin, Im not sure.  
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:50:29
I'm still open to ideas on how to make something useful for the Bitcoin community.  I am right now coding and testing a way users can tip each other instantly with Bitcoins.  kind of like the Bitcoin Tip bot here but more user friendly and faster 
@_date: 2013-03-03 04:02:17
This is something I have to experience 
@_date: 2013-07-27 13:37:42
I have bought Bitcoins through Campxb and Coinbase.  Coinbase has a wonderful website and a app on the android store that makes things simple.  Campxb is a really cheap way to purchase coins without high fees. Both have been responsive to customer support and active with their customers. I am seeing a huge improvement on these exchanges everyday.
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:42:42
I'm not sure yet.  Its still evolving....

Thanks! I'm trying to carry the brand fossil watches.  Its not easy because most brands require you to carry a decent inventory, have a physical store, and sell a certain amount each month. I will definitely include women's watches (or at least unisex) in the next couple of months.
@_date: 2013-08-14 22:57:16
Did anyone else pay with Bitcoin and not get a email with the codes?
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:07:22
Is this good or bad?
@_date: 2013-09-02 16:06:37
There is always a risk with any personal information being held by a company.  Coinbase is used by tons of people, including a few big companies.  A good example would be Humble Bundle which uses Coinbase as a payment processor.  I would not worry about Coinbase running off with all of your money or selling your information.  I had great success with Coinbase, and I am amazed that Bitcoin has come this far.  As a verified level 2 user I have never put any trust into any other exchange but Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-04-28 20:59:25
I just want to say, thank you.  I have been waiting for something like this forever! Looking forward to this taking off.
