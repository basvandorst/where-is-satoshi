@_date: 2018-01-05 07:36:03
You aren't wrong, but it's kind of a theoretical vs. practical thing.  Practically you are completely right, but theoretically that's how much money is there, or at least some indication of how much money or purchasing power is there.  Liquidity, time, velocity, etc. change that equation but with all else equal, you can at least compare two assets based on the market cap (again assuming all else equal / in theory).  I mean the dollar value isn't really real either given your explanation, because that's just another currency/asset.  So at least it gives us something to compare with since it's all relative anyway.

Bitcoin isn't just an investment to a lot of people.  You might see it as just another investment, but many here actually want Bitcoin to succeed.  On the other hand, when I invest in a company on the stock market, I couldn't give a fuck what happens to that company as long as I can make some money and get out at the right time.  Bitcoin is not that.

1. Fiat money is not backed by gold.  That's been the case for over 30 years.  I don't understand how people still think this.  Especially someone who is following Bitcoin and offering up his perspective on Bitcoin forums like he knows what's going on.
2. People have been warning about the lack of day to day currency usage with Bitcoin since it was created 10 years ago, and it keeps rising in value.  This  isn't the usage that matters, and it even puts downward pressure on the price, which would give Bitcoin less value.  Bitcoin's use as a store of value is what gives it the most value, and it's what makes it the most "useful".  It doesn't need to used as day to day currency to be useful and valuable.
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:00:04
It doesn't change the algorithm.  It would still be sha256.  This would just change the relationship between the pool operators and the people providing the hash power.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:10:31
Nope.  I said "for a lot of different reasons".  You have to look at the whole package. You can't isolate one attribute.  Other reasons include first mover advantage and the so called "Immaculate Conception" of Bitcoin that can never be reproduced.  Having another crypto that merely has an attribute that "holds the same" doesn't get it over the barrier of the network effects of Bitcoin.

That's not what people are talking about when they talk about immutability.  The immutability discussion is about central authorities making specific decisions about what to change.  It not about the chain self healing after a bug is fixed.
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:35:18
They don't have the power to flip a switch and roll back the chain.  What would happen is that they would fix the node software to fix the exploit, and then it would be up to everyone running nodes to update their node.  Those patched nodes would then define the chain differently by rejecting invalid blocks.  This is why it's important for everyone using Bitcoin to run a node.  The users decide what Bitcoin is.

Confirmation means it's added to the blockchain.  You seem to be talking about a transaction being added to the mempool before it gets confirmed.  This is what happens immediately when you press send in a wallet.  Not trying to be a dick.  Just wanted to let you know.

Segwit is on-chain scaling though!  We need to stop arguing that there is either "on chain scaling" OR "segwit".  It's wrong and confusing the "on chain scaling" people into thinking it's something else.

In a few (or several) years, we will have a much better idea about what can and should be done to increase capacity again, or even if we need to.  Jumping the gun now by just speculating about what Bitcoin technology will look like and what hardware and network capabilities will be prominent is dangerous.  SegWit sets up the technology much better for improvements down the line anyway, including some scaling improvements.  Let's not put the whole thing at risk now until we give the tech a chance to do it in a safer way than just making blocks bigger.
@_date: 2017-02-19 07:55:58
Exactly like any other non-segwit tx..  segwit just needs to be activated, and you need to spend from a segwit enabled wallet.  Otherwise it acts just like a current tx.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:58:18
SegWit literally makes on chain blocks bigger.  The more people opt in to it, the bigger they get...for every transaction.

That's not correct.  LN is enabled (at least in a cleaner way) by the malleability fix that SegWit transactions provide, but you don't need LN or any other payment channels for SegWit to fix malleability.

I've been using Jaxx with the Chrome extension and my Android phone.  It's pretty nice to have access to one wallet from both devices.
I've been wondering though, what's the difference between pairing devices through Jaxx and just importing the same seed to multiple devices?  When you pair a device through Jaxx, it just asks for the seed.  So is Jaxx really doing anything special here?

True, but it takes time to develop the tech to use the blockchain for various things.  There's no software to "back up my computer on the blockchain" yet, but if you make the blocks unlimited size, you can bet someone will make that.

Right, when it comes to changing consensus rules, it is convoluted (current situation is case in point).  POW is king when consensus rules are consistent.

There is definitely not certainty in BU's vision.  It's an extremely risky vision actually.  We really have no idea how it would pan out, but there's a pretty good chance giving all the power to the miners to set the block size at will, is not going to turn out well.  There even seems to be a highly risk tolerant attitude on the BU side that is pretty scary.

The white paper isn't a governing document.  It's a technical document that describes how the system works.
The whole point of Bitcoin is that people don't have to follow rules that are written in some paper because the system just works how it works.
The valid chain isn't valid because the white paper or people say it's valid.  The valid chain is determined by how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:28:00
You are really in the weeds with this comment.  The definition of money isn't what's important here.  There's over 100 devs on core and I'm sure they all have different understandings of money, and certainly the users of Bitcoin, and supporters of core, vary as well.  It's interesting to discuss, but not relevant to the core principals that make Bitcoin work.  Not least of which being decentralization and network stability.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:55:41
Then they can just try to fork later after trying SegWit out.  This argument makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:27:27
Why are you worried about this?  This should be left up to the people doing the actual engineering.  The vast majority of which seem to support soft forks.  This insistence on hard forks because it's "clean" seems OCD and strange from users who shouldn't even be bothered by this.  Protocols work best when they are stable and don't fuck people over.  Most successful protocols have lots of tech debt and it's fine.  Imagine changing TCP/IP to something incompatible tomorrow and bricking billions of dollars worth of networking hardware.  It's a stupid idea.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:36:25
There is no argument about if we should have a capacity increase or a malleability fix.  Everyone (mostly) wants both of those.  The argument is about how.
If you think forking to BU is breaking away from politics then I don't even know what to say.  There may be politics on both sides, but it's certainty not absent from the BU side.  You're just trading one dev team for another.
You misunderstand what it means to be decentralized.  First of all Core doesn't have a monopoly, and they don't decide anything except what code changes go into the software they are maintaining.  Other software, including BU have their own maintainers who decides what goes into their software.  Neither team can force anybody to run their software.  People choose to run it.  Currently people mostly choose to run the "Core" team's software even though there are many other options.

That's the conspiracy theory from the "other side", but there's never been any evidence of that.  Anyone can run a LN node, and they are even incentivized because they take fees to route the transactions.  People keep looking for ways to incentivize nodes, well this is it!
Plus, LN isn't "Core".  It's open software and has many different implementations from many different companies.

Preach.  Seriously though, I also hate that people think SegWit is somehow the end of the road.  Let it activate and improve things and enable new tech, making Bitcoin more capable along the way, and then we can revaluate in a year or so and decide what the next step is.

The question is why does this use case need its own coin?  What would this coin do that Bitcoin can't?  For Bitcoiners, the question always comes down to, why not just use Bitcoin?  Do we really want a world where we have all these different coins for different things?  I don't think we do.  One of the awesome things about Bitcoin is that's it's global and we can all speak the same financial language.  I think we already have your "tourism coin".
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:48:14
I'm so sick of hearing about the "HK Consensus".  It was irrelevant then, and it's irrelevant now.
I get your first point, but I find it really sad that all the other benefits of SegWit might be passed on.  Features that will fundamentally make Bitcoin better and more valuable.  There is no reason to think we can't hard fork later if we have to...If the devs can't think of any more tricks to optimize it further and we really need to fork, they would have no choice but to hardfork and I believe they would do it with full agreement.
We should avoid a hard fork as long as we can though, because a sound money doesn't change its rules out from under people.  Even if it's not perfect, stability is one of the most important things Bitcoin can provide to reach it's potential.  Otherwise I don't believe it will.
@_date: 2019-03-16 21:24:53

Yes!  It does help.  Nodes determine what blocks are valid.  If you believe your node is defining what bitcoin is the way you agree with (with segwit), then running your own node helps the network against nodes that are trying to define Bitcoin differently.
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:19:58
Not to mention all the human monitoring and interaction that the system would all of the sudden require.  I'd rather have a system I can rely on to not change out from under me when I'm not paying attention.  What if I go on vacation for a while?  I might be forked off the network when I come back?  Not cool.

People keep saying this, but as he said, facts are facts.  I withdrew coins from coinbase to my trezor, and guess what?  Trezor doesn't have bc1 receive addresses, but what do you know, the "from" address from coinbase and the change address back to them were both bc1 addresses.
@_date: 2019-03-20 20:47:14
Well, following the pattern, that would make it sound like another LN node implementation in Python, which isn't what this is.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:52:14
But the argument that core won't fork later is totally not logical.  Core won't fork now either, so what's the difference?  Why not activate SegWit and see where that gets us and then try to fork without core if it's still not good enough?  It's still a fork without core now or later, and maybe, just maybe, a fork with core later, which would be the best scenario.  Unless of course it actually isn't about the fear of core forking later and more just a play for power...*That* actually makes more sense.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:32:21
The difference is it has to follow the consensus rules that the users of the system agree on (mostly by what software/nodes they run).  You can't just code-away peoples' freedom to choose the rules they agree with.  Bitcoin has grown so far because people understood the rules and opted into using it based on that.  If the rules change, it's up to people to decide if that's what they want to use, and what they want to call "Bitcoin".

Kind of.  That's only part of it.  In the real world, people are going to choose whether they want to follow that chain or not.

The definition of currency is irrelevant.  The original argument is spending vs. holding as it relates to increasing value.   Holding clearly wins.  Gold is a hedge specifically because it holds value better than any "currency".
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:45:54
Yes it does.  Gold is rare, which makes it valuable, which makes people want to "hoard" it.  If it wasn't rare, all the other attributes of gold would be all well and good, but it wouldn't hold value because everyone could have as much as they want.  Things that are "used as a currency" don't hold/increase value.  Dollars, Euros, etc, are all terrible stores of value.  These all decrease in value over time.  Name me one "currency" under your definition that doesn't lose value over time.  You are right about diamonds, though it just further proves my point, not yours (scarcity creates value).

Yes. You can have redundant wallets.  When you set the first one up, you'll get a backup phrase (a set of random words) to write down and keep safe somewhere in case your device breaks or your house burns down.  You can reach restore your wallet with the backup on multiple devices if you want to though.  This goes for most hardware or software wallets.

I really think you have this wrong.  People only buy Bitcoin because they think it will go up in value or at the very least hold it's value better against other things they could be investing in.  Nobody would be buying it otherwise.  The currency argument seems to be that people are going to adopt it as currency because it's neat tech or something.  Nobody cares about replacing their currency just because the tech is cool, or it's decentralized, or censorship resistant, or any of that.  The "currency" head-to-head doesn't look good for Bitcoin against credit cards for example (no "Cash Back", no purchase protection, I have to handle my own security, etc.)  Good luck selling that to the masses.

Dude I don't disagree with you on any of that.  It doesn't change the fact that a Litecoin isn't a Bitcoin.  They compete for marketcap as separate assets.  There are 21M Bitcoins and 84M Litecoins, not 105M Litecoin\-Bitcoins.  If that were the case, you'd have Litecoin\-Bitcoins trading at $3000 or something instead of two different assets trading at different prices.  Bitcoin is clearly the better asset and that will become clearer to more people over time.  That's not the same thing as having 105M Bitcoins.

No one \*should\* value a currency because of its energy efficiency, but this is quickly becoming a concern for mainstream users.  I don't know if you've realized but "global warming" is a huge political concern for the average person out there (with a particular political leaning).  It would absolutely be a deal breaker for a lot of these people.  The argument needs to be made that this isn't the problem that it looks like on the surface.   It's not a argument now because Bitcoin is becoming irrelevant.  It's an argument now because Bitcoin is growing and reaching more people who care about this issue.

Well it's really hard to measure accurately.  I don't think anyone really knows the answer.  And it depends on what the scope is of what Bitcoin will replace.  Bitcoin might just replace the central banks, and maybe most of the retail banking industry stays intact.  On the other hand it might replace everything.  It's a super complicated question.  But, it's really easy to point at one simple system like Bitcoin, where the energy usage is relatively straight forward, and freak out about it, vs. looking at a really complicated system like the banking industry, where most of the energy consumption is hidden or not really thought about.

Right so the equipment gets more efficient, meaning we get closer and closer to a point where we are simply converting electricity into money/bitcoin with nothing lost in between.  This doesn't mean total energy consumption will go down though.  We will continue to use more and more.  Green energy, like solar, will continue to get cheaper though, so we'll get to a point where we keep using more and more energy, but affecting climate less and less.  The problem will just change to do we have enough metal, glass, and silicon to make enough solar panels.

The point is they are separate assets.  Altcoins might compete for a little bit of the entire market cap but they don't really delute Bitcoin.  There's no better coin for parking your value even if you move out of it for a transaction or two.  And I think people will end up not even bothering with Litecoin eventually because it won't end up offering any actual benefit once later 2s are mature.

Quebec can do what it wants. It does put it in perspective as a whole though.  I'm not worried.  Bitcoins hash rate is higher than it needs to be.  It probably won't drop, but it may flatten a bit and that's more than fine.  Anyways the demand will generate more supply, so who cares if it's more demand than what some city has at the moment?  They'll go somewhere else and/or create more supply.

When someone pays you, you have to look at the blockchain to see if the payment was made.  You get this information from a node (either your own or someone else's).  You keys don't help you know that a payment was made to you.  They only give you a way to move your coins to someone else.


No you can't.  Please tell me how you cryptographically confirm that a node is telling you something correct.  This is complete bullshit.  The ONLY way to verify it is to run the software that runs the rules of the network yourself.

This isn't correct.  What has driven the price/adoption of Bitcoin thus far is the store of value use\-case.  There's a limited amount and the price goes up because of that.  Very few people would be interested in buying Bitcoin if it was just supposed to be used as a currency and didn't appreciate in value over time.  The vast majority of people in the world think their national currency is just fine and couldn't care less about replacing it with something else.  The promise of their wealth increasing by holding Bitcoin is why people are buying it.

Yeah pretty much.  Neutrino will allow light wallets to send and receive on LN.  Some wallets will probably start to look into integrating LN.
But the end goal isn't to have LN as an option...it should be hidden from the user that they using lightning at all.  Many wallets will probably wait until the tech matures to that point.  That's when LN will really be usable for everyone.

1. It doesnt matter what Satoshi said.  It's how it works.
2. Forks and 51% attacks share fundamental ideas.  It's all based around how hash power and nakamoto consensus works.
3. I'm not making any moral judgment about whether alts should exist or trying to stop them because I said so.
An attack on a fork is a 51% attack on the fork.  If you don't understand that fundamental, I don't know what to tell you.

Patience man.  Yes, these problems are being worked on and it will continually improve.  I follow the developments closely and it's all moving very fast.
I have no doubt at all that it's all going to be very easy to use.  You won't need to worry about channels or think about you funds as being "locked up" or anything like that.   Downloading and using a lightning wallet will be just as easy as downloading and using a Bitcoin wallet today, except the experience will be even better because you can forget about waiting for confirmations.

Encryption is an application of cryptography.  They are not the same thing.  Nothing in the Bitcoin blockchain is really encrypted.  That would imply that there is hidden data, which there isn't.  The cryptography used in Bitcoin is more for authentication, meaning it just verifies that you have authority to move funds.  Nothing about the funds or the addresses is hidden/encrypted.
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:04:20
The thing is, Bitcoin was designed to be the only one.  This whole blockchain idea wasn't supposed to be multiple coins.  Satoshi didn't anticipate ASICs, and that's really what enables multiple coins.  If hardware wasn't locked to one algorithm, all altcoins would be a minority chain and be vulnerable to attack, and there would only be "Bitcoin" which would be the longest/most-work chain.
Now, the world we live in actually does have ASICs and allows us to lock hardware to a specific chain via the algorithm we choose.   But, if an altcoin decides to keep the algo of the majority chain it splits off of, well then, it's going to be vulnerable.  It's not PoW's fault.  It's exactly how PoW is supposed to work.  They are using it wrong because, if they really want a seperate chain/coin, they need to change the algorithm.
Of course the problem with that, is if there are not asics for it yet, it might be vulnerable to CPUs/GPUs if there is another CPU/GPU coin out there that people like more (so they want to attack the other one).  At the end of the day, the game theory discourages altcoins.  There is only supposed to be one chain.

It is secure for the majority chain.  Minority chains are not supposed to exist.  PoW works very well for securing Bitcoin, and it was designed to not allow 2 forks to continue.  It's working exactly how it was designed to work and is secure.  People just don't understand it and are using it wrong.

It doesn't have anything to do with being a business or not.  Your personal taxes are affected any time you make money from anything you sell/trade that has increased in value.  You are supposed to track everything.  If you sell your house and it's gone up in value, you pay capital gains tax on it.  If you sell your car and it's gone up in value, same thing.  Your collection of beenie babies... same thing.  Obviously, people don't pay taxes on everything the IRS says you should, but they don't distinguish between business use or not.

Yeah that's a big misconception.
Maybe this will help you: 
In short, the signatures are only segregated so they don't have to be validated by old nodes that don't accept bigger blocks (this is what makes it a soft fork).  For all updated software, the block are actually bigger.
Segwit doesn't compress the data or in any way make the transactions smaller or anything like that.

I agree 100%.  My point is without the devs we have nothing.  They are the ones who should be discussing these things and making the decisions.  It's not the users job to debate this shit and tell the developers what to do.  We should absolutely be deffering the final decision in the scaling debate to the devs.  We are using their software.  Can you imagine the public debating how to design the internet when that was in early stages? Or any other protocol?  It's a rediculous notion.  So for new people trying to wrap their head around these complicated issues, I think you shouldn't.  You'll only be swayed one way or another by some politically bullshit.  Just run Core and do business with companies that support core.  They are the developers that built the software that got us this far and will take us to the moon.  Bitcoin only needs to survive to succeed at this point.  And we need the devs to do it.  They are the most important piece.

@_date: 2018-04-02 05:00:49
I'm not sure where this idea came from that the point of bitcoin was too not pay taxes.  I admit it's been a while since I read the white paper, but I don't think taxes were mentioned, or at least weren't emphasised.  There's plenty of ways to hide your money from the tax man, but whether you use crypto currency or not, they will come after their cut.  But bitcoin provides many other benefits.
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:53:38
It kinda does have to be custodial.  Lightning transactions are interactive. Each tip would need a unique invoice generated from the receiver for the exact tip amount.  It doesn't work if the receiving wallet is offline.
Maybe there can be an online service that hosts wallets so you can receive payments from services like that, but it would have to control your keys.
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:46:46
"All network upgrades are based on consensus"
exactly, and there wasn't consensus for 2x period.  That's why it didn't happen.  Therefore, the "compromise" package deal was dead in the water and didn't have any effect.
Also, nothing was changed at the last minute.  The idea of segwit now, and 2x later was just the understanding that of course 2x would be considered down the line if/when segwit wasn't enough.  It was never going to be a guarantee, and there was never a timeline attached.  That wasn't about the Segwit2x "agreement".
And as you might recall, Segwit2x actually did actually go ahead, but crashed and burned on arrival.  So those people who felt disenfranchised, don't have anyone to blame but themselves for following the plan of incompetent people.
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:45:21

Sure, but how does being able to swap to another coin, give that coin value, when alternatively, you can just use Bitcoin?  I'm not even arguing that there won't be room for others, I just don't see why cross-chain payment would automatically make those other coins useful.

Right, but not just the miners.  The whole block needs to be transmitted to and downloaded by the nodes too.
Edit: Actually, in a Segwit world, there isn't an "actual block" vs. something else.  The actual block contains the sigs too.  They are only split they way they are in order for it to be backwards compatible with old node software.  With new software it's just "the block" with everything in it.

@_date: 2017-07-02 05:47:45
Because with a little bit of analysis it's pretty easy to tell that nodes are set up by the same person.  This discredits the whole thing because people can rightfully screem about Sybil attacks or whatever to say it's a joke.  And they are right.  One person's support is one person's support.  It doesn't matter how many nodes they set up.  Also it's not going to matter much unless they actually process transactions directly not just relaying them, because that's how more economic activity will be processed by the uasf chain and not the legacy chain.  Otherwise it's pointless.

If more people mined bitcoin, there would be more people making less money off of it.  There already is a balance that would work out close to your ideal of a billion people making 5 dollars a month.  Problem is, there are always people who will spend capital on something to get an advantage.  You can't force your ideal balance.  This whole view is based on a fictional view of how the world works.
If you have an actual/concrete idea of making it better, I'm sure people would be all ears.. but your idea of "it should just have these properties", isn't based on anything that would actually work.

I'm really confused by your thought process here.  If you are going to have a watch only wallet on your phone or computer, why would you print out any of the addresses on paper?  There's no reason to.  Then you're just back to having your back up seed on the paper and your (watch only) wallet on you phone/computer.  Again, your seed is not a wallet, it just allows you to restore your wallet on a device.  It may sound like I'm splitting hairs here, but I'm not. I'm sorry but you are wrong.  Paper wallet do only have one address and  private key.  That is what a paper wallet is.  Paper wallets (real paper wallets) are dangerous if you don't know the details of how they work, so we should be precise when talking about them.

It uses LND.  I don't think it supports others, but I could be wrong.  It's packaged with LND, so you can basically run it in the Zap software, or pair Zap with your own LND node.

The title is fine.  It's just a reading comprehension problem.
\*difficultly\* is down.  \*hashrate\* is ticking up.
That's what it says, and that is what is happening.

A lot of "business men" are trying to take over bitcoin, or at least heavily influence it, but bitcoin isn't about business. You are missing the point if you think it is.
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:15:32
Why do you care so much about how it increases?

Exactly.  He tried to bring political tactics into a technical discussion and got burned.

Bitcoin isn't a vision.  It's a project.  A software project, with code sitting on GitHub.  You can get to it right here:

A backup seed is not a paper wallet.  A paper wallet means that the piece of paper is the wallet and you can transfer funds to it because it has an address.  A backup seed allows you to restore a hot wallet, but it's not a wallet itself.

I know right, look at all the people using bch/sv because they have bigger blocks /s

There aren't many real viable use cases for ethereum, so I don't see RSK being super useful either.   I think native Bitcoin smart contracts with Simplicity is going to be much more useful.

Sure, democrats would love a universal world currency, as long as it's centrally controlled and incentivises or forces behavior that they agree with.
Of course, I don't mean to say this is exclusively democrats.

WTF are you talking about?  You might want to re-read this conversation.  Sorry, I don't have time to walk you through it.

Could you imagine if bitcoin was designed from the start as a compromise?
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:55:33
"With that said, it is exciting to think what would happen if Bitcoin were to be legalized in the US."
uhhhh what?
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:53:02
The price of bitcoin as no effect on anyone's ability to use it.

They would also have to increase the wegwit block wieght to 8 MB

Open source software typically isn't the product.  It's just the software that powers an actual business model.  The business is usually services or hardware that can actually be sold.

LN is succeeding.  There is massive progress happening.  Either you are not paying attention or you are willfully ignorant.  Maybe you missed the 2x debate?  This has been hashed and rehashed for far too long.  I really hope you find something better to do with your time.
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:08:06
"Because I'm guessing that number is way higher than 2mb"
I'd rather not guess and keep the block size as small as possible.  There is zero good reasons to increase the block size before seeing how good segwit does first.
This "compromise" doesn't make any sense.  It's just babies stuck on thier side that they've chosen, trying to save some face and get what they want.

It's going to be really good for everyone in this space when we see this play out and Bitcoin survives just fine.  The Lindy Effect in action.. One day we will run out of FUD that can attack Bitcoin and we'll all be better off.
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:19:55
Your are correct. Roger has just confused the shit out of people.
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:17:21
Well if you didn't let people bother you so much, maybe you could be more leveled headed about bitcoin itself.
