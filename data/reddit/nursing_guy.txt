Well then sorry for the overeaction response. Though while I agree that taxes may be a consideration of you are considering spending/cashing out bitcoin I feel personally the subject of taxes would taint the well water when trying to describe HODL as a philosophy
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:04:38
I don't think HODL means what you think it means
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:26:55
is pretty accurate in his response, but I would like to clarify 'honoring coins created before.' when the hard fork occurs these coins are essentially 'duplicated' so there is a brother and sister coin on each network that shares the same ledger history. They 'honor' the coins created before in the fact that every wallet on that network will have a spendable copy. If I have a prefork bitcoin there is a twin prefork bitcoin cash. I cannot spend the actual Bitcoin on the Bitcoin cash ledger though. I have to use the twin wallet
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:04:15
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:33:35
Uh, no. You pay taxes when you realize your gains if you live in the US or however it works wherever you live. If you are HODLing there are no taxes to pay.
If you are avoiding taxes the word for that is tax evasion. Not HODL
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:36:35
I'm going to end up turning this into an infographic someday. Poor newbies get so confused by this classic meme. Here is the original post where HODL originated.
 
To summarize-
-HODL is a drunken mispelling of HOLD
-HODL is an admission that 'I'm not smart enough to get rich by caling the highs and the lows. What the price of bitcoin is tomorrow is a mystery to me.'
-Philosophically it is antithesis of day trading as a method of speculation. Regardless of whether you think bitcoin is going up or down you don't sell. Not to support the price but because 'I don't want to have less bitcoin'
-Philosophically one doesn't try to time buys based on the market. They buy bitcoin because 'I want to have more bitcoin' regardless of price.
-It doesn't mean don't spend the bitcoin on things you want, it is a criticism of trying to time the market.
--It is important to note that people in this community are rarely HODL purists. HODL is not a religion. Especially when the price has made significant gains we see people talking about the wisdom of considering a 'profit taking' if you have a life changing amount of money in bitcoin. A person 'has found their moon' when they decide to take all or a portion of their bitcoin to pay off their mortgage or take their mother to disney world. HODL is not greater than LIFE.

Each coin has their own limit of 21 million. They are not the same coin anymore after a hard fork.  Ideally a hard fork is 'non-contentious' which means a majority of the network has agreed to a rule change (this is what is meant by consensus) and the old chain dies off because nobody is mining on that network. If a group continues to mine on that network and people continue to transact on that old network without the hard fork rule change there is effectively two separate sets of currencies with their own caps, their own rules, and incompatible with each other's networks. This is inevitable in a contentious hard fork where a group agrees to change the rules without majority support of the network.

I looked it up and you're right. That is confusing gosh dang it. 
I will not argue that I'm not a noob, but I would think this a rather esoteric part of the mining functionality that won't matter to most consumers, even educated ones. Most of us just call it the mining reward, unless I'm missing a conceptual difference between coinbase and mining reward?
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:39:13
I think that would qualify as a black swan event  
Basically something that we can only truly understand the mechanisms of how it came about in hindsight. 
It''s possible that the current consensus is on a contramarket track and that our current development track will lead us to obselescense. I feel though that bitcoins development is far stronger than alts and that users are experiencing a sort of 'time dilation' where we are just not realistically aware of just how fast we are moving. With 1000s of alts it seems like a new technology is being developed every day but in reality each alt is only making very specialized developments and are not moving all that much faster than bitcoin. If anything we are seeing people rush to be 'first to market' with an idea and then spending a lot of time fine tuning that development. Whereas bitcoin developers often fully develop something which needs minimal postmarked adjustment and then move on to the next major project (which everyone is aware of for years and thus we get 'we've been waiting on this feature forever')
Other markets often have the benefit of being less open source and thus able to control expectations.

Currently lightning network is kind of like your modem or your ISP (not in how the function but your relationship to them.) It's a frame work that your browser, your phone, your TV connect to and do all the complicated work for you.  If you are an advanced or even curious user you can access and use these frame works without an consumer level device.  The frame work is there that users can manipulate their wallets to use lightning network, but consumer level development hasn't been realized yet.
Ideally you wouldn't have to do anything to set up your wallet to be lightning network ready. Your wallet would have an option to send a transaction over lightning or directly to the ledger and would handle all the mumbo jumbo from there.
Just like we could use the internet before internet explorer and AOL. People like to talk about lightning striking, but exchanges, crypto bases services, and generally people who have some level of network development experience are the only ones who are going to be able to safely utilize the lightning network until wallet developers have figured out how to smooth out that experience for the consumer.

Price is the last price BTC sold at.
If you are up against a wall and all the buys are little buys then the price doesn't move. Blocks are green because price doesn't drop and are technically upward movement because they are buying out the current market which (eventually) eats the wall.
If someone needs to sell they can either sell at the wall price and wait their turn gambling that buys continue to come in at that price, or they can jump to the front by undercutting the current market price and sacrificing a very small amount of profit to instantly sell (because there are already buy orders waiting unless you are selling a large amount of btc.) 
All in all not very suspicious when volume is this low. Short-term Bears (long bulls) are not buying because they think the price will go lower ergo their market share isn't participating in driving the price up. Bulls don't have enough momentum/funds ready to enter the market either because they are timing the market for a lower price or there just isn't enough interest to overcome the bears. The bears creating the sell wall aren't panicing enough to drive the price down (gambling that the price will bounce again and they can maximize their profit/stoploss I.e. short-term bulls)

"I know that one thing which holds homeless people back, sometimes, is lack of a bank account."
A bank account serves many purposes that Bitcoin can't quite fulfill at this time. A bank account allows people a means to (usually) feelessly cash checks, issues legal checks, serves to prove income and holdings, and most importantly holds, secures, and acts as a record of fiat currency for tax purposes.
I think wide adoption of bitcoin would be amazing for the homeless, but doesn't currently have a whole lot of utility outside of a non-visible means to hold onto value (theft, especially by individuals in their immediate circle of trust who can manipulate them, is a huge problem in the homeless community)

Bitcoin divides into portions, I currently buy about 1% of a bitcoin at a time but a satoshi is 100 million the of a bitcoin and in the future software may calculate fractions even smaller. If you value a Crypto currency like bitcoin higher than your fiat it makes sense from a philosophical point of view to go ahead and start placing some money into it. Think of it as saving for a future bitcoin based purchase instead of having to convert all at once. If you are lucky the bitcoin will eventually value beyond your expectations. If not you still are saving your money in a system free of banks and centralized gov and will one day spend it on something of your choosing.

It is a level 2 solution, meaning it's an update or service involving bitcoin that doesn't affect or change how bitcoin works, you can still use bitcoin without ever involving LN, lightning is slightly more centralized (though devs have worked very hard to keep that at the very minimum needed for this development.) think of it as somewhere on the decentralized and of the spectrum between bitcoin on-chain transactions at the fully decentralized and using coinbase to transact between coinbase users (fee free but fully centralized off-chain) on the other end of the spectrum. All are legitimate uses of bitcoin, $)serving different needs.

Strange, I think that is the definition of fair. People who have reason to make their transaction priority can do so and those who don't need the money IMMEDIATELY RIGHT NOW can low ball the market and make room for others, and everyone else used a market standard rate. The part that is particularly fair about this is that everyone is participating in the same market without any favoritism that isn't purely math based. Yes the rich can move their money around faster but the mathematics makes no determination if your wealth is deserved or earned or more worthy than anyone else's. The market rules remain the same for everyone and everyone knows the rules.
Any solution that isn't tier 2 like LN doesn't scale well with decentralization. no matter how much support it may have the math doesn't care about politics. Yes it means that we have to wait for now. Thankfully that means the early adoption window is bigger for the rest of us. As great as bitcoin already is, it is still not finished growing yet. Those of us adopting now are betting on the potential of tier 2 solutions like LN and that the market timing won't be so poor that the market moves on without us. If you think the golden age of coin is now perhaps then an altcoin is right for you and you may end up winning. For now I see the strong demand for a solution like lighting network as a very good thing and I am glad they are taking their time to do it right and thoroughly.

For some this is all we can do. It is definitely advisable not to 'invest' more than you can afford to lose. From an investment standpoint this is a very volatile product. From the adoption standpoint if you believe that this is the future of currency there is nothing to stop you from moving all your funds into bitcoin and trying to live minimally and strictly in the bitcoin market a la Andreas Antonopolous. It is tough, but doable for the determined.

In the example you provided you are trusting that the bank will transact your funds, not deem your transaction innapropriate, charge reasonable fees, use and secure your data in a manner you would not find objectionable, as well as the myriad of trust involvement in just using fiat such as that the government will not print so much money that yours depreciates in value (it's depreciates 20% in my lifetime easily) and that the government will not invoke fiscal policy that affects your quality of life such as caps on savings in which any excess is taxed to meet national debts obligations (such as in Greece.) 
In exchange for mathematically secured monetary policy, security and privacy Bitcoin expects you to be a responsible steward of your finances. A chargeback was a solution to a problem that also produced another problem of chargeback scams. Chargebacks are strictly consumer friendly and may make sense to someone from a customer is always right perspective but it is a horrible nightmare for vendors (who are people too and whose livelihoods depend of that money as much as yours does.) 
Bitcoin is a level playing field. The government can't freeze your wallet. The bank cannot hold your funds for 5 days for processing and verification. And YOU have no right to control money after you spend it. Be vigilant in how you spend your funds, because it is more like cash in your pocket than a balance on your credit card.

This community is always going to recommend HODLing. I personally agree philosophically. You should evaluate your goals though any time you are considering selling. Are you investing for retirement? Could this money affect your life such as eradicating an lifestyle altering debt?
This community is strongly vested in bitcoin as a new means of money and often invest as a means of liberating themselves from fiat currency which includes features affecting your life and your community and your children's future. You may find after research that you too believe that the era of decentralized currency is coming.

1 btc =1 btc. 
I was explaining to someone the other night that bitcoin is probably undervalued if you are in Greece or Venezuela where bitcoins properties have a higher value compared to in the US where the dollar is currently better managed and banks are significantly less of a threat to your finances. Since it is a global market the price averages. I said overvalued to this person for the US (I was talking to an independently wealthy individual who wanted my thoughts on when Bitcoin was going to pop and was explaining why I felt the price was more secure than it appeared) but I believe it is certainly undervalued in the long term given the very solid technical foundation and it's potential for technological growth.

Just a note on people being 'in it for the money.' it reminds me of when people were concerned about the drug trade 'deligitimizing' bitcoin. As Andreas says Bitcoin and the blockchain doesn't differentiate between a 'legitimate and illegitimate' transaction just as it doesn't differentiate between a legitimate and illegitimate use. If someone uses bitcoin for investing against fiat and making money then that is a legitimate use. Bitcoin is currently growing into meeting this use and it's a little disruptive to the rest of us.  Everything will be fine and this too will pass.

Bitcoin does not equal coinbase. It would be a large suck on the market value but Bitcoin is antifragile for these scenarios. If you are particularly worried about your Bitcoin it is recommended you learned how to manage your own private keys whether you decide to go with a paper wallet or a cell phone app Wallet or even a PC wallet you may even run your own full node.

Consensus is a convention with lots of institutional interest. Over 4000 attendees over 250 speakers. Some people think that Consensus will spark another bull run. Some people have gone so far as to say 'price always goes up after Consensus'
These show how price has acted around the time of Consensus for the past three years (this is the fourth convention next week.) As the image shows, there is little historical evidence, which would have only been weak evidence anyways, that Consensus positively impacts price.

I think that is a philosophical issue, such a case may naturally evolve as the value of Bitcoin compared to other currencies begins to stabilize.
I would argue that everything is valued in comparison to other things we just tend to notice more when that value is volatile. Milk and gasoline have prices volatile enough to be the subject of dining room table discussion even though they are arguably more 'intrinsically' valuable objects than currency.
There are good arguments for why Bitcoin may not be Merchant ready yet as a Technology. There is also a lot of worry trolling, such as your post. Even with the neat developments in wallets these days the user experience for Bitcoin is still very much under developed which makes the explosion of developer interest in the past year very exciting in the space

I haven't done that yet at least since 2011 when I played around with this stuff on my laptop. I get the impression from the community that you would want to have a dedicated computer for it you would download Bitcoin core or compile it yourself from this code it will take a day possibly two to synchronize the blockchain since it will have to validate every transaction that has ever occurred. There are some very in-depth Guides and tutorials both video and text. I'd Google some and watch some read some anything that you download I would compare to the GitHub repository and make sure you have the legitimate Bitcoin core and nothing that's been altered

The kind of security you are trying to describe is called air gapping and I suggest you read up on stuxnet which showed how making a virus ubiquitous made it damn near impossible to secure.
Yes I still think a $30 burner phone from Walmart has a more secure operating system then your scenario and I make that claim and stand by it despite never auditing their system.
Though perhaps I could imagine matching that security if you added an analog printer or typewriter to your scenario, and compiling an old Light operating system yourself on the flash drive from an incomparable Source like a CD

 this is Andreas Antonopoulos on securing your Bitcoin. As he states in the video making a paper wallet is not highly recommended despite public sentiment about them. Making a paper wallet requires some expertise to do securely as every device involved needs to be secure it self and personal computers and printers are almost universally compromised. He makes several really good recommendations on cell phone wallets. And explains why cell phone wallets are the safest for many consumers at the public level of expertise. I personally like Samurai wallet, but I do not have the expertise to audit their security the way that Andreas does I know he follows Samurai on Twitter and retweets them a lot but I don't know what his stance is on their security

This technology is developing and evolving. Miner's and exchanges needed to know this if they wanted to be involved. Your arguments lend themselves to the notion that the tech is evolved all that it should have to, and that is simply not the case. Of you want to be part of the infrastructure in this space then you are committing yourself to writing lines of code and exploring security vulnerabilities so that your customer doesn't have to.
Part of that is deciding if segwit and other advances are right for your company. All bitcoin tech is opt-in From the bottom up. If you are making those kinds of decisions because it's too much work though, this might be the wrong market for you to be an early adopter at the infrastructure level.

Each word is essentially a numeric value. The words could have been completely different, what is important is that they are universally adopted and represent these numeric values across all programs.
Say you have a 12 word seed. Those words are essentially a 12 letter password, but the language they are written in has 2048 letters to choose from instead of 26 letters in the English alphabet, because there are 2048 bip 39 words.
These 2048 words were carefully chosen to be easy to memorize, by selecting words that were easily recognized, selecting common words that are unique and hard to confused, they are all short and unique after the first 3 characters. By eliminating words of a common theme such as 'woman and women' if you can't remember the word but can remember how the word starts or the theme of the word you reduce your chances of looking your seed.
This is all to bridge the gap between the complexity required for cryptographically secure seeds and our brain's insistence that life be made as simple and lazy as possible.

So, if I get this right, you are suggesting some kind of logic gateway for entering the mempool? Each device would only get to run the hash for the next block if they achieved some arbitrary function which exists solely to reduce power consumption?
My major hole to poke in this, other than there is no game theory explainable reason for consensus to adopt this protocol, is that energy consumption is part of the PoW feature, not a bug. All that new energy goes into providing security for the network, and because that energy is a cost sink for miner's there is strong economic incentive to use that energy as efficiently as possible.  Which is why there are arguments that Bitcoin is far more energy efficient than fiat systems and carries a smaller carbon footprint than other money transfer systems

Lightning network is a spiderweb of multisig transactions. If you were participating in LN and wanted to 'reverse' your balance back onto the 'legacy' network all you would have to do is broadcast the latest channel balance, which is just a regular transaction.
There is no single point of failure. Every transaction is in a format where every single participant can opt off of the network at any time by broadcasting a standard Bitcoin transaction.
Since segwit and LN are already functioning protocols I feel the point is moot. I think you may be confusing LN and segwit as services, like Google or Facebook, that need to be maintained and updated. These are protocols which are basically fancy instructions any person can follow to make their Bitcoin do something. Even if everyone stopped using the LN tomorrow because something new came along if two people wanted to run a LN transaction they wouldn't need anyone's help or for any pre-existing network except the regular Bitcoin network.

I like Andreas' take on this, but I find that I am not in a position to identify another block chain as valuable from my perspective. If there is another emerging crypto that will be valuable it is benefiting from the insane amount of trash coins out there obscuring it from the public.

This community is very focused on bitcoin. You will find a very strong preference for Bitcoin here.
A block chain, and by extension its tokens, are a means for exchanging value across a network and securing that network against a spectrum of attacks.
How you utilize that functionality is irrelevant to the network. Your posts suggests you have a new utility in mind that could respond to the presence or absence of a token. I might suggest the following questions to ask yourself:
1-could this be done buy an end-user product. Such as a program that manages it's own lightning node wallet and performs the desired function for a user that sends the specific value to a specific address. In this case you may be able to save yourself a massive amount of work.
2- Am I making an innovation that would benefit the network as a whole. Maybe you can put together a test net as a proof of concept or propose a BIP, or send a theoretical post out on the BTC Dev Linux mailing list to get feedback. Either way, your use for a token would benefit from Bitcoins 10 years of adoption growth rather than trying to start from scratch, and you will find this community a lot more welcoming to someone who tries to contribute to a better Bitcoin than someone who is trying to compete with Bitcoin.
And finally 3- Do you understand that you don't need permission. You can build on top of Bitcoin, beside bitcoin, away from Bitcoin. It doesn't matter. Your new token can be just something your friends use to reward beerpong wins and nobody can stop you.
This community is to rally around our champion and to witness what we truly believe is a revolution of technology. We welcome you to be part of it, but if it truly doesn't satisfy, go forth and be your own champion.

It allows us to confirm that the transaction is indeed in the mem pool and can confirm it even in our own memory pool, and allows us to see how much he tipped the network or more accurately how much cryptopia tip the network. We could even confirm if it became an invalid transaction somehow. In the end it's an easy way to pass on a lot of information and allows us to make some deductions like the fact that cryptopia hasn't presented a transaction ID at all would indicate that it hasn't been processed and sent to the network yet and that the slowness is on cryptopia part or that he sent a reasonable fee but the network might be a little backlogged with higher fees and he should expect it sometime and say the next 6 hours if conditions remain the same etc etc

This is where a large amount of security was gained for a small loss in transparency. The only thing gained from keeping C and A addresses the same is it makes the user feel more comfortable, which intelligently designed wallets already manage. In the actual transaction though every step is an added vulnerability. So in our current system we have:
User Spends A to wallet C &amp; B;
    If A=iA (what my ledger says the value of A is) then value is transferred to C &amp; B
    If A=/= iA then the transaction is invalid and rejected
    A now equals 0 and I now know A cannot be spent again and that there is a valid B &amp; C wallet (2 steps)
In the above proposed system:
    User spends &lt;A to B
    If A &lt; or = iA then transaction is valid
    A is now A-iA for my ledger
    If A  &gt; iA then transaction is invalid
    (2 or 3 steps, up to 33% more calculation, relevant. 
    because we are doing this thousands of times in 10 minutes)
Where this really applies is double spends, since I know when A became invalid I also know if A comes along with another transaction to D &amp; E that occured earlier than B &amp; C I can invalidate the C&amp;D block easily. Whereas if there is a running ledger in A I have to calculate A's past balance and recalculate not only the balance after D&amp;E to ensure there is enough left over but calculate a whole new balance for after B&amp;C.

A coil converts energy to heat more efficiently than a rig. Mining rigs lost heat is not sufficient to power energy conversion. For example someone made a hot tub using their rigs.

Because threats to the network are constantly evolving, those who take responsibility for resisting threats must constantly assess the nature of their threats and their responses within their sphere of responsibility. This effects everyone from the wallet owner to the developer to the advocate.
It's happened in the past that when prices skyrocketed, blocksize increase was discussed and many came to the conclusion that the nature of the blocks being full was artificially created and that blocksize increase should be rallied against. Next time all those factors might be in place, but other factors may be as well. More development may have occurred, other economic and political factors may be in place.
It will be discussed again, and even those who disagree that it is the best option may be convinced to support a strong consensus for blocksize increase.

This kind of talk happened all through the last bull run.


Why not? Cryptocurrency tokens can represent all kinds of ownership. A huge part of Crypto growing up IMO will be using Blockchain secured contracts in a legally binding transfer of assets on whole different scale of value.


Why would almost any current altcoin retain any value if it doesn't innovate in a valuable way? Any crypto currency that can't divest it's value away from Bitcoin or integrate a meaningful innovation into Bitcoin space isn't valuable.


It's not like they will go up 10 or times either. These gains on BTC's coat tails will be arbitrated away as the market becomes more efficient


No doubt. People buy crap all the time thinking they have and will retain equivalent value. It's like buying generic. Frequently it will do well enough for the purpose but the brand name is usually more valuable for good reason. Your knock off Gucci may do well enough for a purse but I'm not going to buy it off you when I'm shopping for Gucci.


Which is why they divide into 100 million Satoshi. Owning 1 BTC means absolutely jack squat. It is a decimal place.


Not just an eye sore. It's against the rules. There is plenty of forums where they would welcome this conversation. This is not one of them. This community is for Bitcoin, if  that is sour grapes for you I suggest you go looking around. Tons of communities for exclusive (insert token here) discussion. This is ours.


If something is inferior then there is no benefit to treating it as equivalent. In fact such a belief puts me a risk to be a victim of fraud. Knowing how much you value something in relation to other things is important.
As for all cryptocurrencies coexisting I recommend you look into something called Gresham's law. Eventually two currencies occupying the same space will result in a loser.

I can see how realism practiced in the earlier community prevented me from joining as a mop or sociopath. I often regret not becoming more active earlier when I encountered this technology in 2010 and recognize that it would be world-changing. The realistic point of view of the community "that it will moon or go to zero" became ingrained in me quickly and I was not ready to be a fanatic at that point in my life. It gave me time to digest and understand the technology, longer than I would have liked but when I came back I truly adored with the creators had done for us. 
I look around at all the price posts, especially those arguing that it should go down more and go up more for whatever fiscal sophistry reason and I recall my own post on bitcointalk in 2010. The difference now is we feel a lot safer from the boogeyman of zero. The price and the long history have made us forget that Bitcoin exists for the goal of being better money. No matter how hard we think it would be, no matter how unlikely in the face of our devotion, all Bitcoin has to do to fail is chase away the creators to other projects which in fact becomes the better money.

This is not a game. This is not Las Vegas. Bitcoin does not exist to entertain you, it exists to be better money. 
You are not entitled to profitable mining. In fact, if you can't innovate in some way to be competitive then the free market should specifically punish you. This would not change with a 10mb block, it change who gets punished and the color of their skin.

Also I lauded the creation of the daily discussion thread. It created a safe place for a lot of the off-topic yet interesting discussion surrounding the 2017 bull run. Now a year old though I realize that we have given low quality content a place of honor at the top of our community. As the first thing visitors see it sets the tone for the subreddit which in turn inspires the quality of content submitted.
Without a polarizing and overwhelming topic such as the bull run, a contentious hard fork, or popular emerging technology, the daily discussion thread becomes a festering sore of barely acceptable content which influences the rest of the community.
I don't want to chase away users like you to find joy in celebrating Bitcoin. The fact that we have this shared experience of celebrating Bitcoin this day &amp; age of its infancy is priceless  and I can certainly agree without reservation that is a priority and a responsibility of those most active in the community and it's moderators to preserve that spirit.
There are alternative approaches, I am certain, which will fertilize and water both the seeds of quality and celebration in equal measure elevating the community as a whole bringing more reason to celebrate for more people.

... there is no oil standard.
The dollar is backed "by the full faith and credit of the U.S. of A" there is no central oil repository for you to exchange your dollar for oil at a fixed rate (which is what 'backed by' means) if you want oil for your money you have to buy it on the free market where the price of oil vs dollar fluctuates with demand.

On chain has transaction fees which are governed by competitive free market. You select your fee (like a tip for whoever mines the block) and then miners put the transactions with the highest fee on the block.
Think of the block like a bus with limited seats. Instead of being first-come, first serve, those who pay the highest price get on the bus first. If you are in a hurry or have an emergency you pay to cut in front of the line. If you can wait you save money by catching the next bus when the line is shorter.
Lightning network doesn't have competition to get your transaction where it is going. The effect is something like scheduling all of your errands into one bus trip. It still happens 'on-chain' because you have to buy the bus ticket, but you were smart and did a month's worth of shopping and saved yourself 29 trips.
This is a very low level explanation but I hope it helps answer your question. I'm happy to help you understand how these networks do these things if you have any questions.

If Wal-mart started accepting bitcoin, I'd probably move more fiat into bitcoin (and be thriftier with my shopping, because I want to save my coin.) When services like tenx cards get some history of reliability I fully plan to live off bitcoin.
But the market and the technology isn't quite there yet.

I know what I believe and I believe in the technology, but that isn't a place where I can explain to you who wants to understand the price. I see a growing infrastructure superior to what came before and my estimation of what the price should end up as is just a deduction from how I value bitcoin's technology.

I know this is pretty redundant but what about a state blockchain? Instead of a global chain you could have local chains or maybe 'microchains' where 3 or more interested but trustless parties are reliant on accurate states could publish to the blockchain. It would provide the level of trustlessness required without requiring the global resources of a larger chain. I need to think on this because obviously a malicious party could 51% attack a smaller chain pretty easily. Really just throwing ideas into the wind here, I am not a developer
Edit: another idea, a redundancy hub, maybe run by an open source code on the ethereum or other Turing complete chain the simply records your latest state broadcast and will accurately transmit it for the fuel cost.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:21:47
Cash doesn't have chargeback/tx reversion.  Bitcoin was modeled in this way to ensure trustlessness.  Your observation is why some feel that bitcoin will not be the end of 'evil and corrupt banks' because centralized services still have a very real demand in this world.
Bitcoin can still be widely adopted IMO, because it meets a very specific demand. While it certainly cuts into the business of payment processors when adopted, it isn't even competing for some of those needs.

It's not a fast track, if you have the focus for learning programming from the basics up, but I found trying to turn a raspberry pi into a lightning node and troubleshooting the issues I come across myself is teaching me so much about programming and bitcoin programming. I am learning the value of digging through github documentation and getting practice some of the mechanics that I had trouble understanding with programming before.
My point is picking up a project and learning as you go is a lot more fun, and will help you get some specialized knowledge, rather than trying to learn a language from the bones up (which can spend a lot of time on redundant factors.)

I wasn't imagining that the lightning node would be dependent on the Dapp except during a database issue.

The problem as gathered by me is that the client side state data became corrupt, then the client used reloaded an outdated backup of state data. From the thread of comments I assume there are many methods by which this could occur including hardware failure.
The Dapp I suggest would be a means of essentially automatically backing up the state every time you broadcast a new state, which then could be recovered if all else fails, and hosted in a transparent/trustless way on the ethereum/turing complete blockchain.
I do agree that the most effective client side software would be one that was not vulnerable to this failure. Maybe it is a lack of imagination or education (which is fine, I'm not writing any of these programs, just pitching ideas) but I don't see a purely client side solution that reduces risk enough for me to be happy. Ideally if all my hardware crashes I want to be able to reinstate that same wallet on a new device. These states aren't the same as wallets were I can recover them algorithmically if I understand correctly.

I don't know when the market will restabilize. The basics I know say that the market will eventually go through another stable period, and will have other volatile periods which may be more or less volatile than this one, and this will occur for as long as enough people are trading the currency for it to be called a market.

Nobody wanting to *hold* USD would definitely crash the dollar.
People here want to *spend* BTC, they just want to spend BTC on things they actually need and want. Not just spending BTC for the sake of spending it. They also want to save BTC as money, even get paid in it when possible.
Savers entered the bitcoin market first because they were pushed out of the fiat market, because as you said it discourages saving as a principle. This didn't and doesn't hurt BTC, it just means liquid markets have to operate within the amount of BTC available to them, and it does. And at times people, often described as weak hands, stop saving BTC and sell or spend and that liquidity changes.

I'd argue that while this is a legitimate use of off the cuff probabilities though an amateurishly high number for a Beyesian probability. I doubt the statement 'Szabo is not Satoshi' is an extraordinary claim for him and thus wouldn't take extraorinary evidence implied by 90% confidence to adjust his belief.

My impression, with no evidence whatsoever, is that Russia must be interested in destablizing the area. Normally Trump is so friendly with despots, it's bizarre to me to see his administration embracing Guaido so something about it feels off.
Maduros people have arms and the current military. America is starting to send money to Giaido's people (about a billion/year in oil compensation) so now they will buy arms to secure their new government.
What happens do you think when you have 2 opposing leaders, 2 opposing causes, 2 opposing armies, and small theater like venezuala? 
I think supporting Guaido is the right move. I also think you can do the right thing the wrong way. I've not seen such an aggressive move of support for a foreign government in my life time, but I'm awfully young and have witnessed far fewer of my countries mistakes in real time.

Killing off the USD is exactly what you said. 
S&amp;P 500 is a 21 trillion dollar market. It's important to the conversation because it is one of the few things that demonstrates how 21 trillion dollars behaves in a market with other assets and currencies.
Crypto is not stocks, fiat or gold. It shares some qualities that can be compared to these when discussing the theoretical effects of crypto on the world, and we can only discuss these things in theory because something like Cryptocurrency has never happened before. There are no other quality data points to suggest how crypto MIGHT affect the world.
I still stand by post.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:14:55
The 10 minute block is somewhat arbitrary but represents the blance between a functional transaction speed and network security. Bock size has nothing to do with this btw. We are looking at hash difficulty. You could triple the block size without affecting the block discovery rate (theoretically anyways, not a direct correlation, more of a hardware, propagation of information affect. Think of larger webpages take up more bandwidth.)
Anyways if you cut hash difficulty in half you get block propagation in half the time. You also cut cryptographic security of the network down. I'd like to say in half, but I believe the reality is by factors. I'm sure someone more mathematically/cryptographically inclined could explain the mind boggling huge numbers of computers required to compromise the network right now.
Decrease difficulty=faster with less security=lower faith in the network=lower value as a technology
Increase difficulty=slower with more security=lower utility as a currency= lower value as a currency
Both these factors effect price and adoption. If blockchain is being used to secure say legal contracts or records, you could increase the hash and therefore security because speed of transaction is outweighed by security and 30 minute blocks are not problematic. If blockchain was being used to secure fiat currency (dollars) and there was a centralized authority (government) insuring value and going after bad actors in the network (such as secret services going after counterfeiters) then you could have a faster network because faster currencies are more competitive in the global market and security is externalized and risks insured (the government can always add more currency to the network) This is of course theoretical.
Bitcoin has no central authority so security cannot be externalized. Ergo 10 minute blocks

This is the only salient point you've made so far. Bitcoin is theoretically resilient against attacks and has done well against predicted attacks so far and adapted to surprises. Bitcoin has not experienced a coordinated attack by government yet. And as Andreas Antonopolous likes to say 'they will fight back, and if you don't think they will, you misunderstand what we are doing here.'

Appreciation in value is a phase. In the early days Bitcoin had a use case for 'illegitimate' transactions. Now not so much but the adoption for 'legitimate' transactions is increasing. The reason that people are so into investing in bitcoin right now is that people see that adoption would have an S-curve effect on the value. Eventually the curve should flatten out to where depreciation and adoption rate no longer massively effect the value and bitcoin will make a hard shift to currency. This is the theory anyways.

I don't think anyone expects indefinite exponential growth. It may be deflationary but, and I'm speaking theoretically mind you, deflation should decrease logarithmically until it reaches a value, where like inflation, the market finds acceptable tolerance. If bitcoin exists for long enough it is feasible that there is not significant amount of deflation for decades that isn't correlated with an equally significant value added to the market (such as another baby boom adding large amounts of labor or a the development of a whole new technology or industry sector)

-We are discussing consequences on a global quality of life scale
-Even when trying to give pessimistic estimations humans tend to undershoot the reality of the situation more than 50% of the time

Well there is also all the bitcoins seized through government forfeiture during criminal investigations that have made the news for all that they are worth.

7000/2000=0.35 or 35% or 65% loss
11,550/7000= 1.65 or 165% or 65% gain
In the first one it is a 65% loss calculated from 20,000.  Keep in mind that was a 13k loss. If we calculated that same loss from 7K it would be 13k/7k= 1.86 (rounded up) or 186% loss.
In the second one we are calculating from 7k. That is a gain of 4,550 dollars. If we calculate that same gain from 20K it would be 24,550/20k= 1.23 (rounded again) or 23% gain rather than 65%.

How do you expect them to enforce that? The network has no way of knowing if a transaction originated in Japan, America, UK, or Kenya.

Fiat punishes HODLers by reducing buying power over time. Bitcoin doesn't judge or punish. If HODling was so damaging then those million or so bitcoin in dead end accounts from Bitcoins genesis days would be a real problem. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, limited only by software settings that don't even require a fork to change. Theoretically if there was only 1 Bitcoin in circulation it could serve all the financial needs of earth's population.
Also, on a more basic level. If nobody HODLs during this early period of adoption then it won't keep enough value to gain traction as a medium of exchange. People have to want bitcoin in order for them to accept it in exchange for goods and services. If nobody wants to HODL then who is accepting Bitcoin who isn't just going to sell it on an exchange right away.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:46:33
Rephrased without HODL, with saver, that is exactly what happens. The difference between modest and extreme inflation is just a question of how much punishment/motivation the governing body wants to provide.
One may not need more than 6 months savings in an efficient budget, ( I'm not even going to argue about whether that is true for everyone, it's irrelevant) but my money is not yours to decide how much I should save. Some people are saving for a new car, some are saving for retirement, some are saving to start a business, some are saving because they want to leave everything they possibly can to their offspring. The market exists to accomodate them all. No one saves USD because they believe in its future potential as a technology, but if they did they would be free to, if they wanted to, at a rate of 2% loss buying power per year. Whatever.
People did spend gold when it was deflationary as long as the deflation was reasonable (obviously bitcoin isn't reasonable yet.) At some point you find your moon and you spend. There is something you can buy that you want and you have the security of a paycheck coming next week to replace the spent currency. If you are secure enough that there is always food in your pantry and the bills are paid on time you even splurge from time to time. 
Yes with deflation investments have to have the potential to outpace deflation to be interesting to a significant amount of investors. It is definitely a different system and nobody knows how every little bug in the system is going to work out. Some bugs may even be permanent house guests and have special names like the Byzantine Generals Bug. Someone clever might someday find a fix for the bug maybe not. New clever people are being born every day. Both systems have their faults. Fiat was not designed to be perfect, and the government's didn't care if fiat lasted forever when they implemented it. Fiat is a solution to old bugs that had to be fixed. Bitcoin is trying to solve some other ones.

Surprisingly we didn't adopt the euro as a global currency even when it was 2x the USD.

Math. A lot of people, especially in this community, believe Bitcoin is a product and service which will have a global demand and widespread utility. If that is the case then the current value is exponentially lower than it's value at maturity.  This is because of very basic undisputed principles of economics.
People don't argue over whether a global product and service in demand with high utility and limited supply would have a mindboggling large value. It's mathematically certain. The debate lies in the question "Does Bitcoin fulfill this description?"  Either Bitcoin does and is horrendously undervalued in historical terms, or Bitcoin does not and has no essential value as a monetary product anyways.
There are some very real monetary needs, on the global scale, that bitcoin is on track to fulfill. These can be hard to see if you live in a first world country with comparatively well managed treasury, so I recommend watching any Andreas Antonopolous video where he speaks on the Greek collapse and Venezuelan inflation crisis.
So either Bitcoin has value, in which case these are the very early years, or this is all an illusion and we are playing internet monopoly.

I'll reiterate my earlier points now though in a way I will hope is more clear.
I never said the sky is falling on USD. The analogy of punishing USD savers vs investors literally came out of my economics class in college. You are attacking this idea because of the source (a bitcoiner) and the context (a bitcoin forum.) I can see that I am an enemy to you and this is my home turf or whatever analogy for conflict you want.
bitcoin isn't gold and it isn't fiat. It shares some properties of both and comparisons only serve academic and theoretical discussion at this point. It won't eliminate either one on the global market, but has the potential to compete for use cases on a global scale.
This is just my opinion, someone smarter than me may find a way for it to work and end up making a lot of money, but traditional loans are a horrible use case for bitcoin.

To build on this, properly executed paper wallets are the most secure but as Andreas Antonopolous points out they are terrible if you don't have the most rigorous security measures when making one, so they are not recommended because of the high barrier.
Coinbase is a mile high wall. All the security is automatically done for you but they are a big target that every bad actor would love to crack. There is no insurance in bitcoin.
A phone wallet is more secure than a computer. For reasons why and sound advice securing your phone wallet I recommend listening to Andreas Antonopolous' video on the subject of securing your wallet

I'd compare him more to natural flora of your skin or gut. He's not lethal to the ecosystem, in fact the system is supposed to be resilient to the reality of his greed. Since he is taking up space doing his self-serving greedy thing, viral entities have to compete with him and those like him for resources, or expend resources removing him from the ecosystem.
Yeah it sucks if you think your beneficial/symbiotic goals would fair better without his competition, but his role in the immune system wards off life or death threats. Whereas the benefits of a higher price are more like good skin or pretty hair. Yeah it makes the host (Bitcoin) more attractive but that stuff is going wrinkle and Gray eventually anyways.

As I've seen quoted elsewhere, "compared to what?"  Bitcoin has a smaller carbon footprint than what the United States Federal Reserve *admits* too and that is just one currency.
Bitcoin also has economic incentive to always seeks the best power/work ratio. Technology is pushed to be more efficient. Fiat doesn't have that since everything can be subsidized due to a monopoly.


I'm not sure what you are referencing here but as a general rule of thumb, opinions exist independently of facts. An opinion may be provable or not (in the former it becomes a fact, but opinions can be stated prior to evidence) I don't know what you are getting at though.
As for the premise of your post, regarding a fossil fuel conspiracy. It's not impossible, by that I don't mean to give the idea any credit. I just mean there is no law of physics or reality preventing such a scenario.
Without at least some minimal evidence it's not even worth considering. Literally a waste of brain power and time.  Add to that, a conspiracy to increase power usage would likely have had the predictable outcome of massive power consumption. 
8 years ago when this project started you could run Bitcoin on a laptop, and no one was building Bitcoin farms.  That is innovation by the free market, and like most cases of innovation they are beyond the original vision.

For me it's because people argue over what the 'acronym' means, some of the acronyms seem like they are meant as semi-serious advice. Also some people point at HODL like it's some serious flaw in the way pro-bitcoin people think. Once you know the truth and the humor behind it, you are liberated to enjoy the acronyms in the same light heart as the original meme. They can be enjoyed in their own without any serious weight. 
HODL differentiates day trayders from well, HODLers. We can say day trading is not for us, that we can't thrive in that space like some others seem to, and we can say it in a one word joke.

I'm a reader not a video person, so I googled it.
Ouroboros Genesis is only recently revealed, so while it may be peer-reviewed, it's not tested. So far it's a research paper, not yet implemented that I can see. It hasn't been published long enough for any public detractions of any quality.
I'll keep an eye on this, I haven't seen anything to get me interested in an alt-coin (you can only dumpster-dive so many times before you get sick of trying to gold in the trash.) I don't really know anything about Cardano. I was surprised to not find a lot of detractors in the comments of the youtube video you posted. Mostly people complaining about the UI in the wallet. Just going off my gut, it looks like the developers are more focused on technology than user experience right now (this is a plus IMO)

You could potentially make a scheme with more entropy but there would always be a way to create more. Every wallet uses SOME scheme to create a wallet even if you don't see it.

No. You could have them give you a regular public address from their lightning wallet, but the funds would not be hash-time-locked until they used those coin to open a lightning channel. You would be paying a full on-network fee, and if the service you are trying to access is automated with lightning network your recipient may be unwilling because that defeats the whole purpose of them adopting LN.






I joined these two together because my point with them is mostly the same. Everyone in Bitcoin supports layer 1 transactions 'right now' because at this time nobody has really done anything that leverages the benefits of a new tech. It is programmable money though, and just because you don't need or want any of these creative new developments quite yet, the fact remains that they let services be developed that can't be implemented or are inconvenient with the limitations of an on-chain transaction. New technology unlocks new doors for creative people and one day you may have need of one of these doors. And thanks to submarine swaps you won't have to mapped the territory yourself before you go through. Submarine swaps are particularly helpful for the people like you who don't feel the need to do more that a level 1 transaction because from your end that is all a submarine swap is. You aren't locked out of part of the economy just because you didn't foresee adopting one of the 8000 things being developed right at this moment or the 20000 things people think of tomorrow.

It is from the days when people could come up with stupid names for shit like murder of crows and pride of lions. Someone said there are seven continents and here they are.

Oh. If you need to access the lightning network once (and don't foresee using it regularly) or from another currency or need transactions to be negotiated in 2 currencies or need to onboard to the lightning network relatively quickly (like in 1 block or 1day) this significantly reduces the amount of technology you need to adopt because you can outsource the adoption to an interested third party while still enforcing trustlessness between all parties involved.

Obligatory I'm not an expert and not qualified to give financial advice.
Don't stop there and I'm not just talking about Bitcoin. Investing at this time in your life is extremely low risk high reward compared to pretty much the rest of your life. If you make losing bets on stocks or commodities with Christmas and birthday or chore money it costs you literally nothing. You aren't placing the roof over your head or a meal for your kids at risk. You aren't even placing a vacation fund at risk where you might have to explain to kids there won't be a trip to Disney land. You are investing money you likely would have spent frivolously anyways. You are missing out on a video game and a half. Amazon was like 25$ when I graduated high school and I knew it was a steal then and I didn't do anything, instead I bought drugs (7 years sober) I discovered bitcoin right after I got sober and knew it was going to change the world, and I didn't do anything (granted, I DID need to focus on my sobriety and it was one he'll of a distraction) now I'm 31 and buying a little bitcoin here and there and investigating investment fund performance metrics and keeping a close eye on 1 or 2 stocks I like. 
I have 3 kids, a mortgage, and a slew of adult responsibilities. I'm ecstatic when I put in 100$ in one go. Even if I had been wrong about AMZN and BTC I feel confident now in hindsight that investing in a way that is concious of what your risks are (and at 14 you really don't have any) is not something you are truly ever going to regret. Never invest what you can't afford to lose, and to understand that really ask yourself what you can do without.

This is actually a really good question. Your UXTO that isn't committed to a lightning network channel should be no different than any other UXTO. When committed to a channel then that coin is exposed to risk of the peer transmitting an old channel state which might not be in your favor. The coin in the LN UXTO is secured by dual signtature rather than just your own private key

Why thank you! My first LN tip, I look forward to getting my node online and paying it forward.

I had to double check, mostly because Pluto isn't a planet anymore so who knows what they did to continents. Also I want to talk to your grade school/grammar school/whatever you call it teacher.

At one point in the LN node set up you point it to an index of the blockchain. Ideally this is your own node's index. So your BTC full node and your LN node are pulling the state of the blockchain from the same source. AFAIK that is the only interaction between the two. LN node broadcasts BTC transactions when you open and close a channel to the network, but blocks are verified and stored by your BTC full node.
The LN node might verify blocks (and may be capable of downloading and verifying the blockchain itself) I haven't seen anything that explicitly says the LN node doesn't have that capability, but everything I've seen recommends downloading and verifying it on a BTC node so this is an assumption.

The price not changing with halvening is an unprecedented prior but not impossible. The total income for miners would reduce by 50% I doubt many of any miners are currently getting greater than 100% turn around.
The rest of your question is dictated by the variables. How much hashing power leaves the chain determines what the new hash rate will be. 
As a hypothetical I find these questions unhelpful d/t being unrealistic. Market is extremely flexible and any chain significantly more profitable than Bitcoin it's going to experience an arbitrage in both cryptocurrency markets and hashrate distribution making the effort of changing chains worth the opportunity cost of the work put into it profitable only for the earliest movers who made the right calls out of thousands of potential altcoins. Halvening is huge upward pressure on the market d/t market fundamentals of supply and demand and would require a very interesting loss of demand event to even keep the price stable.

Even with a 51% attack you can't change the rules or you end up forking and instead of having 51% of BTC hashpower you have 100% of Shit coin (STC) hashpower while the other 49% go along their merry way and double their share of the BTC hashpower.
All you can legitimately do with a 51% attack is mine empty blocks or prioritize only the transactions you like while censoring transactions you don't.

Thank you for the article! That actually makes sense, and I agree it is probably superior to Sub-swaps for topping off a channel.








I don't care if they do, it doesn't mean that HTTPS isn't clearly valuable for the great majority of people.
I don't see that those are extraordinary claims but we are delving into purely opinion now and I concede there is certainly an limit to how useful/informative this piece may be.
That said I still don't think that sub swaps are as useless as you may think, in fact I don't think it is even something new, just a trick that you can do with you wallet, like everything else on the network.

Except then there would be some certainties about Satoshi such as there is SOMEONE alive with the private keys. Security through obscurity may not be a fantastic method for a persisting organization, but for an entity that plans to disappear the more questions the better and right now everything's coming up question mark

I've not heard of this functionality, and I have doubts it exists unless you have been looking at something I haven't, topping off your channel is done through rebalancing tricks AFAIK.


You are making my point for me. You can technically do lightning network 'by hand' so to say by doing all the steps in the lightning protocol manually. Doesn't make it useful. Just like you could theoretically submit all the verification information and interact with your bank over IP manually, doesn't mean it's useful or that they bank is going to accomodate you abandoning HTTPS.


The article explains how they work and some of the potential use for the submarine swaps. They don't make any extraordinary claims for you to doubt. This is a case of "This exists and this is what it does." not "Buy into this amazing new technology today before supplies run out!"

If you want to play around with LN you can build a testnet node and buy blockachinos at starblocks. I think there are some other testnet applications such as a forum where posting and commenting cost testnet satoshis etc. You can get free testnet bitcoin from a fountain with no probs.
