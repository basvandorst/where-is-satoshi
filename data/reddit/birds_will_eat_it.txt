I wanted to ask, is that small transaction some sort of malicious act?  Or just a random glitch?  
@_date: 2014-09-23 06:44:25
Thanks for trying, I appreciate the help.  There is no double spending, everything was confirmed before I sent.  I am completely stumped on this one, wow.
@_date: 2014-09-23 06:57:15
I know it's not a wallet, but it is not reflecting reality, if bitpay says I have coin, where is it? 
@_date: 2014-09-25 09:17:26
Is there a way I run a scan to make sure that is the one and only problem?  I am not confident enough to try building a raw transaction yet, do you think I should transfer the 0.12 BTC and 0.1BTC inputs out of that wallet and just leave the rest?   
@_date: 2014-09-23 10:05:49
You are a true genius my friend, if I just sit and wait I will get it back.  I was already gathering info to try to write a raw tx!  I still might try it for fun.  I also found a thread where other people document my same issue happening sometimes when they bet on satoshi dice, they confirm the coin does get returned!

Hey! No response from bc.i yet,  where do you see them attempting to propagate this?  Can they keep doing it forever?
@_date: 2014-09-23 05:58:31
It has been 5 hours, and I cannot achieve any Network Propagation even after re-pushing the raw transaction again.  I am completely stumped and need help, I do not create reddit posts for things I can learn by reading.

I found the part of the transaction that is failing, its only 0.0047 BTC.  Is there a way to remove the bad part when my coins come back?
@_date: 2014-09-23 09:25:12
Your idea sounds great, but I can't craft raw TX, I just copied and pasted the hex.  Can you tell me the steps or point me to a tutorial?  I generally catch on quickly to stuff like this.
@_date: 2014-09-23 06:34:23
I'm confused, bitpay is showing a balance in my wallet, I'm looking at my wallet now and it shows no balance (20 cents worth of BTC). Is something going to happen? Did I make a bet?  How do I access the coin? 
@_date: 2014-09-23 11:12:31
Hey!  I found the part that is failing to confirm, its 1 small piece, 0.0047 BTC !  Here is the hex for the failed part of the transaction:

What did you do?
@_date: 2014-09-26 16:15:50
Wow, that puts a big kink in my "sit and wait" plan.  I doubt ill get an email response from them at this point, is there anything else that can be done?
 
@_date: 2014-09-23 05:55:34
That is the first thing I tried, I get the response "Transaction already exists"
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:10:00
Thank you, I just sent them an email.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:22:43
Hey there!   I just wanted to update you, bc.i fixed everything up and I was able to transfer everything out to a new wallet.  Thanks for all your help, you have taught me alot! 
@_date: 2014-09-23 10:47:28
Between three days and one week from what I am reading.
@_date: 2014-09-23 06:09:01
Thats the second thing I did!  Comes back with the response "There was an error pushing your transaction to network!
Did you sign your transaction? Is this double spend? Have you already sent this transaction?"
argh lol

I think he is saying he wishes bitcoins value was more stable, it's difficult for outsiders to put trust in a currency which fluctuates so much.
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:38:47
Why was the bitcoin i traded for stuff i want or need worth 4x less than it was last year at this time? I don't understand this computer stuff... I am scared... is this face books fault? time to blame the government and trade it for gold. lol.  I think you forget just how dumb the average person is.
@_date: 2016-10-25 16:56:24
With the fees it costs to buy Bitcoin with USD, then the fees to transfer Bitcoin back into spendable currency it will cost more than just using cash.  That is what keeps me from using it.

When I am traveling the only time I need a data connection have no convenient access to one is when I am driving, usually on a highway.  The need may be there, but it is too random and brief to support your expertise.  The user group would be a niche market and probably wouldn't pull much data.  It also has no room to grow at this point in time, I can only imagine the user base getting smaller in the future.  Honestly your talents are better used elsewhere.

When traveling people normally stay in hotels or houses with WiFi , or can easily stop into a Starbucks or MacDonald which also have free WiFi access.  I love the Idea, it would have been a god send back in 2007.  I agree with I_RAPE_ANTS openbazaar would probably love to have you on the team.
