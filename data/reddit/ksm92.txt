Well I need to be prepared for scammers if I'm getting into this I guess:)) If the internet loses scammers, it would be internet anymore:)) Got scammed twice in the past, not regarding bitcoins, but in one case what I lost was small and in the other I recovered. So my trust index in people on the internet I don't know it's between 0 - 0.01 on a scale from 0 to 10:D

Thanks sir for your answer. I feel it is a honest one. You presses the "feels" button right there. That's what I wanted to hear by posting here. You pointed very well with your 2nd reply, I can't imagine myself investing huge amounts of money but maybe, as you said, a small one to feed my couriosity wouldn't hurt. Thanks again.

I understand, good point. Thanks. Now if I think better, time is the one "resource" you need to fully be sorry for, I mean you can't trade it as bitcoins, lol:d
I will start making some more research, I'll start with the links posted arouns here cause the begginer bitcoin thread it's kind of dead. Thanks again to all of you who postes here !
