This is the biggest puzzle to me so far in the Bitcoin game.  Why isn't China cracking down on Bitcoin?  "We crack down on everything, but it's cool if you want to use an anonymous cryptocurrency that is 100% out of our control".  
If/when they attempt to ban bitcoin I can see that as a major crash inducing event based on the number of coins currently being purchased in China.

unless you purchase something just before it goes down in value - then you came out ahead on the deal.  There is no asset that goes up and up forever.  There will be swings both up and down.  What if "now" is the top and you buy something for half the price it will be next week?  Just can't count on it either way.  Buy what you need, save the rest - just like real money!

Sorry black friday retailers - you just sold everything for hundreds of dollars less than your cost.  Here is where the "hold forever" neckbeards with hundreds of free coins meet the reality of hard-working people who have to buy their merchandise with real borrowed money and are ruined by the volatility of these coins.  Freefall continues - currently chewing through 850 on Gox like it's nothing.

ok and another update a few minutes later - large buy orders coming in - whipsaw back and forth.  doesn't seem like it's going to hold - still lower highs.   - fun to watch, this is pure madness.

just playing devils advocate, but what if we switch and bitcoin crashes back down...  maybe it would be better to wait to see what sticks as far as price goes?

Same here.  Order of alt-coin put my bitcoin into black hole - no open orders, no bitcoin balance.  A bit disconcerting but just waiting for it to reappear.  
I have a feeling all these orders are going to make the alt-coins go nuts when they finally execute (assuming they haven't already)

Here's why it does matter though.  A bunch of retailers just sold their goods for bitcoins.  Imagine you sold someone an 1250 computer for 1 bit coin.  Your cost as a retailer was 1000 (that is a generous markup!).  You go to cash out your bitcoin and find that your 1250 is now worth 800.  You just lost 200 on that sale.  Rinse and repeat for all retailers who participated in Bitcoin black friday and you have a disaster of epic proportions for Bitcoin.

Agreed - I only follow the actual trend - in this case the trend is down.  Something "might" be happening right now but we won't know until the trend reverses.  There is cash on the sidelines but nobody wants to try to catch a falling knife.  We may have found the low at 955 on Gox.

Alright good points there - read the article - certainly trying to make my own luck - proactively learning, trying out mining.  still can't help but thinking this will crash now that i'm in though.  have to work on that one a bit!
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:10:02
This is turning into a correction.  Lower lows and lower highs.    If this "was" the stockmarket, this would be called a major trend reversal and you wouldn't want to hold through this.  I'm interested to see what kind of support there is at the 1000 level on Mtgox.  Ok, as I typed this we are at 1000 - it's make ore break time.  1000 holding on high sell volume.... Good luck everyone!

when i get to 1 whole coin i will start putting out better vibes.  So far my luck has not been great.  Starting GPU mining altcoins and melted my computer in the first night.  I'm the only person actually negative in profit on bitcoins so far.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:12:53
Update after 30 second - tore through support and down to 950 on HUGE volume.  This is not going to end well.

Huge risk for businesses here.  For example when merchants sell in bitcoin they could be devastated if bitcoin drops 20%-40% that day.  Not good advertising for bitcoin as a means of exchange if businesses lose money.  Predictable margins are essential for most merchandisers.  Hope the exchanges go up that day.

thanks bovineeye - it's .1 more than i had before.  I actually had $.03 cents worth from the trybitcoin site, so now this is certainly more interesting to watch the fluctuations over and under $100 in real time!  
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:30:46
We could be at the top (or not).  I don't see the upside at this level, but certainly after a parabolic move there is a ton of downside.  I think after cyber monday retailers are going to start cashing in their coins - could make for an interesting drop if others start locking in profits as well.  This weekend is not the time to buy (probably?).

ha - maybe someday .1 will be worth something.  thought i would feel better having at least some stake in the future.
