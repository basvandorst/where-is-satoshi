Wasn't Max coin just a joke?
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:43:36
Eh true, maybe it will help adoption slightly
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:13:49
As I said the weight is currently 4MB and yet the fees are not enough of an incentive for everyone to adopt. Why do you think raising the weight further would all the sudden change decisions for those that are choosing not to adopt the last raise?
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:27:42
I've noticed sentinel sometimes takes a bit to update after recent transactions just in case you guys didn't know. Otherwise it's straight to the point :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:46:35
It has been increased to a 4MB weight.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:48:38
Here is an estimate of the total Bitcoin nodes, whether listening or not. 
That ethereum chart is listening + non listening as far as I know. Plus the resources required to run a full ethereum node are steep.

care to enlighten us all?
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:55:12
I am sure. Lightning is source routed. A middle hop can choose to not send something where it is told (same effect as just being offline), but they can not make a decision about which route to take, they don't even have that full information. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:11:50
It would be great but I haven't heard any ideas there, for any blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:14:24
The commit counts from the forks are way off though, because the vast majority of the commits in the forks are just Bitcoin Core commits that are cherry picked over. Those should be stripped out and then the fork "activity" would look very poor.
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:34:23
this one has some serious suspense :)
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:03:44
They cannot control routing decisions.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:26:01
Of course each hop "shares a channel with the hop immediately before and after" that is what a channel is...
Sounds like your trying to spread FUD. If not then please read the spec/code because like I said the source fully chooses the routing, and the hops do not know the full routing and cannot change it. A hop can just not send it on, or go offline etc but that is all.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:01:06
So if I have it straight, they buy in so they can create the sell wall with 20% or so of the amount they really want to buy. Considering even that initial amount is a lot, how do they make that purchase without causing the price to go up? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:51:57
Either they are trying to hurt Bitcoin, or the fees are not incentive enough for them to save money by adopting. So what would increasing the block weight further do at the moment, besides harm decentralization?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:05:53
You could use purse.io to buy a trezor from amazon.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:41:27
I'm all to familiar an interface not fitting needs and needing some custom work, but not using it at all on such a critical piece of crypto related infrastructure?
Is it known for sure they don't use core?
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:58:42
Source for their supporting segwit deposits?
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:30:04
Not even whatever fees coinbase is paying is enough for them to make their segwit integration a priority (which is a real increase of blocksize to ~2MB, 4MB block**weight**), where is your proof businesses will not fill up any remaining block space for their benefit? I would recommend sending exchanges messages to prioritize implementing their end of segwit!
The average blocksize is still over a meg. The mempool might rise and fall due to surges in demand or just spam, but blocks stay full regardless.
The block**weight** must be capped to maintain the properties of the network that we are all here for, and the most respected engineers in the space have determined that a 4MB block weight does not sacrifice them.
We have to keep in mind that while 4MB might not sound like much, it effects everything. Everything in bitcoin land is massively copied, including potential transactions. We cannot risk losing nodes, or centralizing miners more. The very last concern is disk space...
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:28:57
In that case you risked 100 dollars for a 30x rise. You can put the same in Bitcoin and make the same if it rises the same percentage. It is less likely some would say to rise that much, and equally less likely to fall that much... That's risk.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:42:54
These posts daily are a great service to keep everyone aware of the current state to guide decisions, +1!
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:31:39
Yes the fees are currently high (also many are overpaying), there are many people working to improve in the short term and long term, without bad consequences.
But a donation to a musician can certainly take a day, and at 111 sat/b with 1 input and 2 outputs (non segwit, so better with segwit) that would be $3.24.
I'd rather see correct numbers so people get correct ideas.

@_date: 2017-12-23 04:41:11
If it proceeds with its features, once it gets trezor support, combining that with being able to peg to your own full node and select coins etc it will be pretty slick!
It's nice to see a wallet that is implementing things like BIP126.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:40:35
Ah coinbase, if your going to use coinbase transfer to gdax first and withdrawal.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:52:41
For Satoshi's sake, I hope that phrase catches on!
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:34:46
And Visa beats ethereum for ease of use and fees as well. It's outlook for decentralization is poor, as well as scaling issues and security. Were is the value proposition that is causing you to expect 30x?
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:36:43
You misinformed or purposely spreading FUD. Lighting is running now in testnet with at least 3 implementation that are largely complete.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:55:59
This can be done transparently in the wallet, no barrier there. Plus lightning has its own onion routing even if your not on tor, nothing regulators can do.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:52:51
Is there some way to see out of all the transactions over 24hours or so, what the breakdown is of exchanges use of blockspace?
I'd like to know who our top offenders are that we can put pressure on, because just USD volume doesn't have anything to do with block space used.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:31:42
Keep in mind it is a fee market. The tradeoffs that constrain the system, why a fee market is needed, are all very well justified, but you are free to research them. Other blockchains, given the same demand, will have the same issues or face the effects from the different tradeoffs made, such as centralization.
As others mentioned, the responsible devs are working on great solutions coming soon that do not make other aspects worse. Lightning, schnorr, mast, rsk or other side chains and more! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:15:16
A little extra complexity to make it a soft fork, which was worth it. Incentivizes miners to take advantage of what? What is the incentive?
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:37:50
Core is an open source project.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:19:19
This is a false narrative. The only way to take advantage of the "spendable by anyone" output, would be by a sustained 51% attack in which case the miners could steal any coin they wished or change anything at all!
The same information is validated now just as before segwit, but with a different format (so txid is non-malleable). Each block has a hash (which contains the previous blocks hash) and the witness merkle root hash is in the output of the coinbase transaction, which affects the block hash. So it is still a blockchain of signatures, but with non-malleable txids.
So it sounds like you are just spreading FUD...
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:49:08
I would expect anyone that knows anything about Bitcoin and mining to question that it could be "backed" by those things.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:36:38
I run a full node, and anyone else that does is a normal peer on the Bitcoin network. That is what makes up the network, so your choice of software for your full node can be something you got from the core repo and built (or verified the hash) or something you wrote and ran yourself, as long as it obeyes the rules.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:32:40
Anyone know if this happened?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:38:00
100 Satoshi per byte at the moment for a lowish priority tx should cost you 3 dollars. Why did you pay 20 bucks?
Lightning, schnorr, mast etc are coming, which doesn't sacrifice decentralization.. so the future is bright. For the interim just use lower priority fees.
Also you didn't have a credit card that would allow an international payment? I just bought a trezor from their site without issue.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:43:58
Keep in mind the repo is just a repo, where open source devs who choose to work on bitcoin (what "core" really means) choose to gather and develop. The running network "is" bitcoin. The codebase can be removed/moved etc and it doesn't give anyone power of any kind over the network. Core is a great bunch of devs and if they ever put out bad code, the community would be the first to point it out and just run better software on the same network.
@_date: 2018-09-21 16:33:31
You can buy almost any fraction of a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:35
Over the long haul as fees become a higher percentage of the reward because of halvings, this will become unprofitable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:24:53
You can create another transaction with a sufficient fee and send wherever you'd like..
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:01:19
That link just mentions withdrawal to p2wsh which everyone has. Question is do they have segwit deposit addresses?
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:44:42
Nothing ever stays "distributed equally" even if some regime starts it out that way. It will reach some kind of natural equilibrium and that's just fine.
However no one holding any of it, whether deep or small pockets will be able to print more and use it before prices adjust, as the oligarchs/govs of the major nations do today.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:12:58
You could instead just send a very low fee one, and then use RBF to make it actually go in. You'll get full validation that way. A bit round about though!
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:47:46
10 dollars would currently be overpaying a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:58:11
It's not 2mb every 10 minutes, block and transaction propagation is ongoing. Do you run a full node? The bandwidth is not insignificant for most home connections. Plus it can't eat up the whole connection or you can't use it for other things. It also would reduce many light client possibilities. Then there is the latency concern which also increases centralization. Add on top of that the possibility that spam just fills it up anyways and it should all be clear why we need to put pressure to adopt segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:22:41
Perhaps they should contribute to core.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:37:29
I think sidechains have a lot of promise too, anyone know how rootstock is going?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:48:24
Basically you got screwed over by coinbase, not Bitcoin. Email coinbase please and let them know you'd like them to adopt segwit. Next time use a different exchange, or even bisq.
Sorry bud sometimes stuff happens but don't be discouraged, this is an amazing thing to be a part of!
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:46:18

@_date: 2017-12-31 20:33:43
can we make the exchange list all the known statuses? That will keep pressure on all of them since everyone deals with different exchanges, not just the chosen ones in this list.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:46:34
bitcoin is always someones, it's either yours or it was mined in a block and is someone elses. At no point is it in a grey area.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:05:59
There is no magic bullet there at scale despite what other coins claim. You need innovation like what the Bitcoin devs provide. Either shrink stuff on chain with things like schnorr, or do intelligent things at another layer like lightning, or fragmenting things like sidechains. Anyone aware of other techniques?

@_date: 2018-08-05 18:00:28
There will always be custodians and paper multiples out there, that can't be stopped. However the difference is that actual Bitcoin can't be controlled or printed. So for example gold had paper multiples, but now most of that is in the hands of central banks which can't go bankrupt effectively. If company lends to many multiples of Bitcoin and it has to stop withdrawals or something, that will be found out.
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:43:48
Heavy regulation might prevent monopolies but with bad side effects, but could monopolies exist without capturing regulation to keep the monopoly?

There are many indirect benefits they get from the Fed, such as regulatory capture. Even just the creation of its existing infrastructure (and ability the sell it) came from Fed money, a large advantage.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:11:09
I don't know why anyone uses coinbase over gdax. Gdax has the lowest fee around for withdrawal, free I believe, and 0 trade fees if you use limit orders. Also lots of volume and a good interface. Kraken for example has much higher withdrawal fees, trade fees and their site crashes more.
I would also recommend not keeping money on the exchange unless your actively making a currency swap. Regular Bitcoin use doesn't need exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:56:08
As far as I understand, if you keep receiving funds into the channel via lightning, it can keep going forever if you wish.
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:58:26
I would highly suggest watching some intro videos about how it works since you might be getting more confused. 
But in short, you have a private key (just a big secret number), you sign a transaction (ideally offline) with the private key, you broadcast the transaction to the network, it gets picked up by a miner and put in a block (of transactions), broadcast again and the rest of the network validates it and only then has it moved.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:56:47
What exactly has you confused?
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:58:51
People lose confidence if they think a fork that isn't offering some new great bit of technology can move value of what they thought was a good store of value or network of the future 
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:12:34
The whole point is to use it, go for it! Just replace the Bitcoin you spent after by exchanging some fiat.
It won't affect what you have on the other side of the fork if you care about that.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:31:08
Ok I'll definitely mention the fees for immediate benefit, but what about to get them interested in the whole idea in case they don't care about a little extra savings on fees?

Extremely well done
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:11:27
Purse.io is nice. But going to places that accept directly is best. Remember to replace what you spent with more Bitcoin.

Perhaps we should be asking why people buy houses with loans instead of savings. I would guess that they feel (even if not always true) that it is the best investment to make before other investments.
If house prices came down and represented the price to buy a depreciating item (more like a car) for the sole purpose to live in, perhaps people wouldn't be so comfortable with such a huge debt.
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:06:39
To be clear the Bitcoin don't move until it's in a new block. It's not sitting somewhere "risky" while it's waiting for a miner to include it.
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:21:43
This video apparently explains nice and simply, something that seems to make sense in terms of long standing human incentives as demonstrated with fractional reserve plus debasing money for hundreds of years. But is the video fully accurate or does it leave out any critical piece?
I am most interested in the truth, based on reason/science/fact/history if anyone can shed light.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:29:28
How so?
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:06:44
No only bank transfer, however you can move instantly from a coinbase account. There is a delay for bank transfer, but that is the only advantage a credit card would give you is speed, fees are huge though for credit card deposit anywhere.. best avoided.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:36:03
We should be using it to encourage more merchants to take it! When you spend it just immediately exchange some more fiat to replace the same amount and there is no loss.

I am wondering whether or not PoS being a tautology is still true after a blockchain already has established value, and instead of locking up coins you prove that you burned them ahead of time?

Many ways to verify. You can verify bootloader, or firmware and can open and verify hardware. I'd also like someone to write a third-party thing to exercise hardware in a way that could likely show fake hardware.
Beauty of Trezor being fully open is that it is just up to you how deep you want to check.

I'm curious why clearly so many companies focus on offering so many cryptos when the vast majority are basically scams and even second or third in volume are not well decentralized. Bitcoin is what you need, what purpose do the other's solve for you?
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:32:40
Just but more btc as soon as you spend it why would you wait?
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:21:31
Dash is not negatively correlated with Bitcoin on any time scale (prove it, if you can). Sure you could cherry pick just some specific range, but you could do that with any currency too. Also dash is crap :-)

Maybe a way to crowd fund it with some kind of assurance as to how it gets used?
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:52:07
interesting, so where does a company that offers an etf fit in, they have to maintain the correlation so that requires buys by the company right?
On the futures exchange wiki, it mentions "By netting off the different positions traded, a smaller amount of capital is required as security to cover the trades." which implies these aren't direct handoffs between buys/sellers?
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:55:59
It could not because the difficulty is set by measuring what happened over the last two weeks.

Clearly if it's free you need a miner that has the best hah rate per miner cost, including psu.

What is the issue with the distribution when a larger pile in bitcoin doesn't give you a way to game the system?
In the fiat system a huge amount of regular individuals' output ends up right back into the financial system when you take into account government/central banks and the class of people allowed to operate with them. It is basically a giant theft.
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:16:13
This is important, what are good communities to do this in? What is the recommended way for family for example, tell them if they can setup a wallet and give you an address, you'll send them a millibit?
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:13:54
Saying the signatures are separated just means they are formatted/handled differently in the transaction (block weight and tx hash). They are still in the blocks just as before.

As far as I can tell Asics are an inevitability no matter the algorithm. What we need are competing Asics built and sold. I'm guessing they are too profitable to sell when you can just mine.. so the question is why does bitmain sell them?
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:09:53
I would recommend and stick to bip39 seeds as its at least adhering to a cross implementation standard.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:18:49
Everyone should just keep one running on their laptop, when it's powered up.
Remember, it can be set to prune and also use less bandwidth with the bitcoin.conf, so there really is no excuse!
Join us node runners! As a bonus you can route lite wallets through your node, such as samurai wallet and have total financial sovereignty. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:51:30
Whatever you were going to do with the cash, just do it with Bitcoin directly. Sometimes it's a bit roundabout but it can be done with most things. This is one of the goals for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:20:15
But would you say that with normal investing of the same amount on the stock market or something similar for 30 years on margin wouldn't yield the same amount or more as a house? Then you just buy it with cash if you want. Also if you factor in moving 2 or 3 times doesn't that lose quite a bit?
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:02:04
Why would it not be permanent demand increase?
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:49:41
Perfect, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:30:08
Well they (old nodes) will download the block, but I am not sure whether they store anything they don't understand... I'd have to check the code. 
Remember basically all the mining nodes are segwit because of the high threshold when it was activated and any full nodes that's been upgraded will be validating.
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:36:59
There point is convenient spending. Your right that does not ease your burden of backing up your seed securely.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:04:19
Fantastic! I also applaud you guys for doing the backend in golang :)
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:28:59
I just booted a 0.15 node up too! Pruned blockchain size to 100GB and upload bandwidth a bit. Anyone that can do this should, and when you make a transaction for anything, use the node or a mobile client that can point to the node.

Prepaid debit card with Bitcoin and pay from that?
Does bitwala require I'd?
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:42:32
You just need to read/watch an intro thing about how it works. All of that will be explained.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:42:53
But keep in mind OP that there are trade offs that each altcoin makes from Bitcoin, usually bad... There are many examples but two of the biggest ones would be more centralization or more scaling hurdles.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:56:44
They are just different, not better on the whole. Take monero, it fixes the fungibility but increases scaling issues. Ethereum has other issues that Bitcoin doesn't have etc. Bitcoin strikes the right balance for something that really could go mainstream. Then add lightning, and then base layer scaling like MAST and it gets better and better.
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:59:48
What I like about proof of work is the time element.  A certain amount of computation is done, which takes known amount of time. Time to build machines and run them. Also buy and sell them as well as time to break even. Doesn't that lack of time in proof of stake have an effect?
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:10:34
You joke but when out climbing, false peaks often feel like this, you can't see over lots of the time.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:05:00
Please keep in mind, without replay protection this won't solve anything as they both get moved. These forks are such scams.. :(

What's the password risk if it's a full node with no coins?
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:42:33
Yes in 30 years, and then if it didn't appreciate past the mortgage your left with having made a bad investment for 30 years no?
Seems like the same thing as margin investing in a single house.
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:13:13
Hm so what does everyone think a minimum safe amount in one address where it won't become 2x a dust amount?
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:56:31
It's healthy to sell for products when you want to further adoption, just buy the same amount right after and your position is the same. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:02:47
But they buy the etf, not Bitcoin. Seems like the only Bitcoin buying might be through whoever hosts the etf, but do they have to?
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:38:23
Ever? I guess with market orders if the best price volume gets eaten up they just match the next price.. is it not in the exchanges interest to ever provide liquidity in slow periods?
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:33:39
I see the volumes, but would be great if someone could keep a running graph :) But I can do that.
I see the rulebook and products on LedgerX's site but I'm not a professional trader so please excuse my ignorance if it is in there (I didn't see it). How do we verify that the rules are adhered to? More specifically proving reserves matching the open contracts?
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:09:21
even better to just go to  at the bottom and hit "check node"
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:26:29
What he meant is someone can't just pull money out of your account like in fiat. That is a feature, and other rules with contracts can be used to do it in a safe way.  This is why people say if you build a system with the hard guarantees at the bottom you can always build on top in a more open way but not the other way around.
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:47:14
I don't know, we all get the impression in the usa that after you get out of school the next thing to do is get a house, and then kid etc. It's part of the culture. But once people start going through the exercise of loans and such, surely people think whether a 30 (!) year loan is smart? Maybe I am overestimating the average Joe..
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:36:26
I still see very in depth activity on the Bitcoin dev mailing list but being that I am not sure...
@_date: 2019-09-25 19:56:27
So for both examples if the strike went over the sold calls, then you lose bitcoin and get usd in return worth less. I am assuming you aren't concerened with losing the upside considering the amounts here? :D Also I am curious how you have the confidence for the relatively close strikes in the first example, and on the bet that the price will go down so you can reverse your position in the second example?
I very much appreciate the examples.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:53:15
Not badly written but you should mention lightning. Also fungibility really could be fixed in the base later at some point.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:43:51
Is there anything else besides antminers available now, that would be profitable?
@_date: 2017-09-27 02:22:48

I didn't, pretty slick :-)
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:34:55
I would love to see more development on shamir39 as well, more implementations and an accepted BIP.
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:14:30
I am curious for anyone knowledge to explain how it is good for Bitcoin in general as well as Bitcoin's price?
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:27:46
Both of these answers are in the book, The Bitcoin Standard, which I can't recommend enough.
But to perhaps give short answers:
* People want to hold it now because the price likely goes up, but as adoption increases and people have more of it or start earning it, they will spend it because they need things, but it will change their time preference of spending choices, and smart saving/spending is better for a population than the faulty notion that spending is all that matters. There is evidence presented in The Bitcoin Standard.
* Just because alternative currencies exist does not mean the properties of Bitcoin change. Just as with other precious metals to gold, your likely to hold value in gold just because it will have more limited production. Bitcoin is as limited as it gets. Combine that with the fact that money tends towards one. Networks tend towards one too, at least for similar use cases, look at tcp/ip, there is value to being compatible with the biggest network. So there might always be other chains, but there will always be a largest, probably with the others showing a power law relationship.
Again, evidence in The Bitcoin Standard.
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:39:14
Fees are not required to be that high, even without lightning at the moment. Choose a better wallet that allows custom fees.
But do use it when you can to further the ecosystem, just replenish your btc after.
@_date: 2018-07-20 15:50:47
He does a good job here about the payment part, and lightly mentions corrupt countries, but doesn't mention the trustless sound money aspect.
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:36:22
Price is my guess.

Hardware wallets are best with passphrased seeds stored on paper offline and redundant.
However if your going to do a paper wallet, make it an HD wallet wallet. Generate a seed on an air gapped computer using a downloaded version of  Also save some of the first 50 or so addresses so your can send Bitcoin there anytime from an exchange or from someone else. To spend from the wallet though, you should use the air gapped computer and sign a transaction offline using electrum or other wallet and broadcast online.
Again use hardware wallet :) or just mobile wallet for small amounts.
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:40:37
Certainly helps the regular network more, but if you don't have a machine with the space, at least you can run a pruning node.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:37:36
why would you consider ltc? It's literally a bitcoin clone with a few constants changed... and those constants are set to something more realistic for large use in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:25:17
This is a common misconception. Utxo(s) are created when you make a transaction regardless of whether the address is reused or not.
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:04:01
How is that any different than other hodled Bitcoin, which does affect price. It isn't paper Bitcoin, they are custodians of withdrawable Bitcoin right?
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:36:16
Lnd did recently remove the restriction that the full node lnd connects to had to be not pruning, made it easier for laptops and such.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:55:28
Nodes relay "valid" transactions, that they themselves validate.
