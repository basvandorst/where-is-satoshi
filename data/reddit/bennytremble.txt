If google endorsed bitcoin it would be huge.

This card is such a huge step forward in getting people to understand bitcoin and recognise it's power and value. Even if the majority of the population does become completely enthralled by coinbase and never understands what bitcoin is that's good for "US, it's not like all other avenues for bitcoin are being cut off. This is just one more road that leads to roam". They are being compensated for people's ignorance. As soon as people catch on that visa and coinbase arnt necessary for the trasaction, they can easily just transfer bitcoin p2p then the jig is up. But this step and shift card is one of the biggest steps forward, and a great solution to the problem of people not so sure of bitcoins legitimacy. Also I can dump more money into coins and not have to worry about how long it will take to use them or convert them back should I need more fiat currency for daily transaction. I applaud shift card.

This is where we are at in the song. 
She said la la la la she said I love you back.
Back within my arms,
And I'm so scared.... that I can't do nothing about this.
And I'm afraid I might be wrong oh,
I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid now.. 
I might be nothing else but wrong... 
yeah I'm so wrong about you
Reach within myheArt tell you what do I feel, can we make it through the night, is this story for real? 
Take time from the other side I'm alive,
I'm alive oh,
As long as you stay by my side...
Aaaaaand that's about as far as I've gotten with the song. I hope she's okay, we fell asleep on the phone together. 
Ps I was diagnosed  7 years ago or so thanks to  and her loving family thanks to these ties that bind. Love always  (put em together yourself) tremble. 
And special thanks to roger ver for being our "Jesus"

Is this good for bitcoin or bad?

Sorry lol I was making a joke, acting like I considered his point to be rational, therefore I'm not in denial, meaning we arnt in the bull trap lol. Considering the events of today, breaking below 600 usd isn't fun and I'm starting to believe I may be wrong. I do know what trends you're talking about though. They look almost Identical to eachother.

What if it's just the market traders predicting a 40%+ percent before the usd traders can? Wild speculation but, wouldnt people not thinking bitcoin will climb, only hold usd during a moment like this(halving)? So I could be possible right?

I'd be a customer

All great points, yes. The hunt is on!

I totally agree and actually took advantage of it (sorry I didn't stay HODL!). I looked at how the spikes always did that in 2013 and late 2016 and thought since it'd be a bigger spike, it'd happen at a higher price. I predict around a 5000 dollar high, which puts our bear trap right where it should be. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:49:36
I guess time will tell.
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:45:39
Well... I guess that's a good point... so check denial of the list woo!
