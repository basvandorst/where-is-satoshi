Not to mention the time spent *checking* bills. It may seem like only a few seconds but when multiplied across the nation over a few years, that's a quantifiable loss of productivity.

It was more just pointing out additional things that fiat currencies fail at. One would never have to spend the time discerning whether or not a bitcoin was counterfeit. Get it?

Maybe I'm oversimplifying things... But wouldn't *not* having to check bills regularly over a long enough timeline be *more* efficient?  
EDIT: I see where the confusion is coming from here. I should have said *checking the authenticity* of bills, not just checking *all* bills (to determine their denomination).

Except for those using it as an actual currency. The spread of use leads to the spread of acceptance, adding further value to the currency by bolstering consumer confidence.

Yeah, we prefer tight butthole around here.

Do u mean for tax purposes? Then of course not.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I consider it greater effort to spend bitcoins than the USD.

This. The reason credit card transactions cost what they do is in part dependent on the costs of dealing with charge backs. Ain't nothing free.

Well, they haven't yet. I have heard bitcoin millionaire several times however.

Not that Lincoln wasn't against slavery, but he was most loyal above all things to the presidency. His chief interest was in preserving the union. He determined that the easiest way to crush the southern economy was to free all *southern* slaves. So yes, he was hardly a tyrant but neither was he the idealized moral champion that many accept without hesitation.

3% may seem small and insignificant but multiply it over a long enough timeline and it becomes rather significant for larger merchants. Why throw away any amount of money?

It's not just the size of the US economy but that fact that the USD is the de facto global reserve currency.

If you get scammed in a deal involving *cash*, is it the cash's fault?

I agree with u to a point but u are dead wrong about gold. Gold is valuable because it is precious (rare), easily divisible, and impossible to duplicate. These are also what give bitcoin *some* of its value.

I could see how that's confusing.

This reminds me of when Berkeley closed down their ethics dept. to increase the size of their business dept.

Don't forgot that the chief purpose of currency is to act as a stand-in for what would otherwise be bartering. Coins were much easier to carry, manage, and transact with than say, 12 pigs for instance.

Haven't checked it out since first purchasing my bitcoins but CampBX.com accepts Dwolla.

The difference is that the USD is ubiquitous to the point of doubling as the world reserve currency. Bitcoin on the other hand continues to increase in value such that if u spend them today u may miss out on profit opportunities in the future. Yeah it's a bit of a stretch but they're not the same right now.

It certainly is *not* unprecedented. Several states have experienced hyperinflation and it tends to occur quite rapidly. The hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic's currency mostly occurred within a yearlong period.
