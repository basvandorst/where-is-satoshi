remember that some wall street dude bought a future contract that is essentially a one million dollar bet that bitcoin will be worth 50k by the end of 2018.
you only should put it what you can afford to lose.  its not guaranteed money.  chill and hold ok?

@_date: 2017-12-15 12:25:52
we hit 19k last week on some exchanges so 20k is the next milestone. =)
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:07:46

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:31:52
do not be confused by the lightning network and the recent fork called bitcoin lightning. two totally different things. research.

bch, bitcoin cash is a hard fork that happened on aug 1 which has bigger blocks and much lower tx fees. btg is bitcoin gold which hardforked around thanksgiving. you get an equal amount of each for each btc you own. so congrats! 
im curious to know which wallet you are using. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:29:13

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:43:15
im sorry i did not know that cex was awarding hardforks. thats awesome! and yes you can definitely keep them there. i would do some research on cex though if i were you. ive heard of some ppl getting their withdrawals stuck on cex. if you trust them then yeah it should be fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:32:32
i made the same mistake in DECEMBER of 2016.  bought a little ranging from 700-900 and sold it all at the end of january.  i forgot about bitcoin cuz i just wanted to put some bets on ufc and ncaa.  its up to you bro.  just saying.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:33:25
i see. thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:00:20

bitcoin was at 11500 just 10 days ago and now its at 17500.  why put your bitcoin somewhere else? i made the same mistake with a hyip.  most likely its a scam. and most likely you are gonna make more just holding.  i learned my lesson.  the .04613 btc i put in a hyip folded.  and it was 261 then its like 600 now.  just hold buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:01:23
abra is a wallet you can download from the apple store. you can use your bank or a credit card. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:25:21
Fork yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:33:08
one time thing. coinbase is supposedly awarding for bch in january. i personally wish i had everything in exodus. its a wallet that supports many coins and  allows you to exchange from one coin to another. i dont know much about cex but ive been told over and over that if you dont hold your private keys you dont own your coins. 
this is why you got your bch and btg in your wallet and not your cex account. 
sorry to press but im very curious which wllet gave you the bch and btg if you dont mind. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:21:43
firstly bitcoin is definitely not a scam. thousands of people have millions of dollars safely stored in bitcoin. i am happy to help you. just dont give me any private information. 
my first question is: do you know how bitcoin works?
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:51:52
alternate solution: move to california. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:08:29
GDAX for sure
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:26:42
blockchain.info can tell you what the balance if your wallet is and all transactions sent to that address. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:02
you won your dollar sir
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:00:23
i didnt know that ledger and blockchain were the same company.  is this what you are saying?  please clarify.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:26:07
you just bought bitcoin at a 85% discount.  congrats. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:28:26
great question. the co founder of the lightning network will be on bloomberg today. maybe she will anser that. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:45:33

@_date: 2017-12-20 15:36:44

one thing he doesnt like is being criticized for talking about things other than bitcoin. i remember him saying that trying to direct his tweets is an instaban. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:11:58
this might sound completely crazy but this is bullish. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:36:23
click and read ffs
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:52:36
ask for proof 
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:13:39
the bottom line is that all markets are manipulated.  the market cap for crypto is small compared to gold and gold itself is being held down by central banks so just imagine what btc is subject to.  hey i dont know anything for sure but with a market cap as small as btc and with futures options you gotta believe that it is manipulated.  however, the technology can become a mainstream currency and with adoption (not mania that we saw in nov/dec) btc can rise astronomically.  so as a little shit I HODL and buy in a little more as i can afford.
