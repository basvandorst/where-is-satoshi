 That awkward feeling when the exchange you have chosen is not that reliable.

Serial Entrepreneur is the best. It’s so accurate for me that I even can’t decide: to cry or to laugh at first :D Will check my LinkedIn profile and erase all info about business, blockchain, crypto, and ICO. Don’t want to be a meme hero.

We accustom to admit what say authoritative people (whether it politicians or popular artists) and tend to believe them. Pro-Bitcoin officials in the government are great signs that can encourage others to evaluate the benefits of Bitcoin. However, the question of whether bitcoin is manipulated is very vague. BTW, the only statement of the official that bitcoin is not manipulable by any government can raise the price of bitcoin.

Well, I very doubt that such exchanges even exist. At least, among the exchanges I used, I didn't find such one.Every cryptocurrency exchange has a commission. And they vary from one company to another. For example, CEX charges 2,99% for depositing and withdrawing, and 0,25%-0,10% of trading fees, [ has also very low fees. So, you just need to do a little research on this topic and compare the exchange between them.

Bitcoin ATMs are good for adoption of btc. First, this is a habitual way for people to deal with exchanging physical money to digital ones. And second, the more people see it around, the more inquisitive they will get. However, fees for buying bitcoin via ATM are extremely high. So you should consider whether you are ready to overpay for the service which allows you to buy anonymously. There are many online platforms which don’t require to verify your ID and charges smaller fees.

Did you try Trading on CEX.IO? It charges just 2,99% for depositing and withdrawing, and 0,25%-0,10% of trading fees. If no, visit their website,  and explore it.

 Some exchanges provide a cold storage for your funds which is a safe and convenient option. Perfect for both holding and using for trading. As far as I know, CEX has such an option. You should verify your account and set up 2fa – that's all you need to use a cold storage safely. This option is less expensive than buying a hardware wallet.

 I would advise you getting a basic understanding of crypto first. After learning, choose the coins you consider to be promising for trading. It is generally better to start with the largest and most popular ones. Then, you must select the exchange that fit all your requirements, as there are a lot of them. Now, about trading. No one will provide you with a ready-made successful strategy for trading. You can use someone’s strategy but there is no guarantee that it will work for you. Trading requires skills, experience, and knowledge. Again, you should read articles on trading, master your skills, and gain experience in free trading simulators.

 That's because people see the potential rise in the price of bitcoin. More people realize that bitcoin won’t burst like a bubble, so they don’t want to be outsiders. Holding is considered to be the most promising activity to make profits from investment.

 Bitcoin has been showing low volatility for almost half a year. But institutional investors don’t hurry to enter the market. It is a standstill in the crypto world, and nobody knows what to expect next. I think $6,5k is not a price limit for bitcoin and it hasn’t yet become a stable coin. People just started to use it more as a store of value. I believe Bitcoin will rise in price.
