Your computer alone can't mine bitcoin you need costly mining hardware. You say you don't pay for the electricity but is likely someone is and will be alerted to the massive amounts of electricity required to mine

Does anyone here think there could be any future implications to using bitcoin mixers? When using a bitcoin mixers are you bitcoins really 'clean' or could the decision to use a bitcoin mixer possibly 'muddy' your bitcoin and  have future regulatory implications?

Coinbase is a great entery level for bitcoin users when I was struggling to get verified everywhere else because I hadn't updated my id licence photo for 10 years. I was buying through coinbase almost instantly. (With limits) And to even think about crying over a 3% fee being too much when I was buying bitcoin under $1000 is hilarious. Coinbase was my entery point into bitcoin and many other do and will onboard through coinbase.

Atm I'm incinded to trust ledger and their reputation not to release something damaging and unsafe. Any keyboard warrior can tell you Bluetooth can be hacked as an argument if that's what your looking for. But until someone actually proves that this can be hacked or even can begins to explain exactly how. I'm trusting ledger to know what they are doing.  I don't know anything about the technical side of this like many others. But it is common sense ledger is not going to risk everything over adding some you ease of use feature unless they were sure and confident of what they are doing.

hackers are not by far the only threat. As I've seen more people want to let the world know they are HODLr such as apparel or bitcoin stickers. You are a easy target for criminal gangs that will be looking out for these signs they need no hacking skills and don't require any to separate there victims from their cypto just physical presence and a weapon
