no.. you needed it to see a correlation between futures and the price action.
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:17:15
Hell Yea.. Take Bob's advice. He knows a thing or 2.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:54:29
All in good time!
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:57:46
I dream of the day we can all stop watching the daily price action.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:22:19
I wonder, how many cringe worthy appearances these 2 can make before the crypto community turns is back completely on the Bitcoin cash project. I saw a best of Roger Ver moments video on youtube, from mt gox, to past forks of bitcoin and onto the present. But for some reason him and fake satoshi appear to walk upright and unscathed by any of that.

this one is priceless though... * cough cough scumbag
@_date: 2018-05-26 14:53:58
looks like a decent news site.
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:01:57
I wonder when we can expect to see some usable Lightning network integration.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:10:42
Reddit too
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:52:43
The tech seems to be as good as any alt coinon the market, but it is specifically confusing because Roger took the name and shills it out to major media outlets as the true BTC. Its worth making that distinction IMO.
@_date: 2018-05-30 02:06:23
Substratum project
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:04:00
This is fantastic news! Round of applause.
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:31:03
More like before smart phone.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:21:39
Futures contracts \+ price manipulation
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:53:54
I don't think that at all. I do think he is a bad actor in the space unfortunately with a significant following.
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:11:38
Thats one.. not the one I originally saw which was actually a bit better. I link it too if I can find that one.
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:10:49
Pretty much sums it up
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:30:27
Totally agree.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:55:08
Idk what happened. Girls used to like me.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:09:33
I can see why he's partnered with Roger Ver. They seem perfect for each other.
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:37:09
Bitcoin lives on.. like the marines. From now in every holder of bitcoin is your brother. We will all die someday. That's what we do! But bitcoin lives for- ev -er!! 
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:31:12
that was a really short story lol.
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:45:29
Yea spending btc ad money.
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:52:43
Nice. This is the best TA I've seen yet.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:01:28
These BCH supporters seem to put a lot of blind faith behind a man with no programming experience and very little technical background. Historically, this is how folks lose their money, but I guess only time will tell. At this point that conversation falls on deaf ears.
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:05:12
This is just the beginning. It's starting get exciting now. Looking forward to 2018-2020
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:32:07
That's interesting... do you have any proof this is taking place ?
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:55:55
Is it just me or does Andreas come off as unusually giddy in the particular talk?
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:34:04
Im fucking buying!!
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:51:31
Looks about right.. after we bottom out it will be a gradual move back up as innovation catches up with the market hype. I feel like this isn't such a bad thing as it removes a lot of the scams and short term traders for longer term value investors. Let's hope.
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:47:29
I saw some BCH holders in r/btc claiming they are buying dinners and items in airports so sounds like some businesses are supporting crypto. Imo were still in the "pizza" phase where its impossible to tell the true long term price based on market discovery. Though depending on when you bought, if you've already made millions life is short. Go hard while you can.
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:39:32
The BCH guys claim to have a fast workaround, but Im waiting skeptically for any ease of transaction. Not that I plan on using it at the moment. In all honesty, I just don't think were there yet and maybe just maybe thats not a bad thing either. Rome wasn't built in a day.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:10:44
Im buying
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:52:52
He's a great spokesperson for this space actually. Hope this works out.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:15:38
This runs contrary to what they are claiming over in the r/ btc forum , but for some reason the lightning scaling solution seems like it's going to make more sense in the long term. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:48:07
Actually I find watching JB helps reaffirm my faith in BTC. Im also always slightly unnerved by how caviler he comes off considering he made his initial millions essentially robbing people of their life savings. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:56:03
Wait didn't he used to warn against the use of bitcoin? I cant keep up with you Snowden!
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:54:58
Wolf of wall street likely posted this. I hope it goes under 1k. I'll buy 3x more. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:55:57
Yay satoshi!!
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:46:16
Its happening. Now is a buy zone... oh and Jordan (wolf of wallstreet) Bellfort disagrees fyi.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:48:56
no doubt. He has an "i told you it was a bubble and its going to zero, get out now " video. Why people believe anything that dude says ever is beyond me.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:02:07
2 things seem to be in the works right now.. sec regulation and institutional investment platforms buying up huge amounts of crypto on OTC. Both seem likely to be the catalyst for the next price spike. When that happens is anyone's guess, but once it does I do not believe we ever see these price levels again.
