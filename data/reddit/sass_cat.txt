in the context of their database being stolen, he says get 2fa to make sure if somebody steals your password your account is still secure.  At minimum it's an implication (will to accept that it may have been a misstatement or taken of context/misunderstood by the reporter), or even just a statement.  that's why I asked if it was clear text and didn't say it absolutely was, because who knows?

WTF, are you  telling me that the password in the database  is clear text? Is this the 90s?  One way hash user name and password then save it in the DB.  you can verify the right password, but no one can just get access to the db to know what it is.  Please tell me the implication that, if the database had been stolen, the passwords would have been compromised is wrong.  Yes 2FA is great, but basic security measures should still be respected in the data store.

I agree a lot with what you are saying here in principal.  I am no fan of Luke-Jr.  Though, I would add one caveat.  Not all people agree that this isn't fair game and most people have a breaking point, at which they stop caring about being nice to everyone.  Luke has a particular set of skills, socially, that place him in the path of this over zealous train.  So, on one hand, I agree with you, on the other hand,  I have very little sympathy for someone that has little regard for social decency and report then gets a bit of backlash for it.
I have, on occasion, lost patience with his abrasive nature and my own cool, albeit, in a much less public manner and on individual threads.  You asshat about long enough and you'll reap ire.  There is no way around it and he's been fueling the train for quite sometime.

The dumbest part of this is it really isn't anonymous, except in the sense of arbitrary inspection of the public ledger.  The people I pay for goods know who I am in order to ship items to me, but it's MY choice to trust them and purchase from them.  MC's model is fuck you consumer we force you to trust us in order to be able to do business online.  And your data? That's ours too and we'll give it anybody who gives us money or thinks you might be doing something they don't like.  They make a living selling people as a commodity.  It's why they lobby to erode our privacy rights and, imo, are the enemies of freedom and privacy.
  We can argue about the anonymity of VPN and Darknet/TOR, but if SR and DPR proved anything it's that in a pure digital existence true anonymity is all but impossible to actually achieve.  All that bitcoin gives us in practicality is a modicum of choice in who gets to know who we are.  In theory, we should have freedom and privacy until law enforcement PROVES we are not entitled to it due to illegal activities (i.e. innocent until proven guilty).  It's their (law enforcement's) job to define, research and identify what activities are illegal.  "But it's so hard to do" doesn't qualify as a legitimate reason to take my freedom of choice away.  If some of these 3 letter agencies and MC/Visa had their way, we'd all be chipped and branded cattle so they could farm, sell and enforce their beliefs on everyone by knowing every detail of your life. . . Then they'd get hacked and your entire life would be free for the taking.
He got one thing right.  The whole point is trust, but not the way he thinks of it.  I shouldn't have to "trust" anyone with my life/data, except myself and who I choose to share it with.
As far as crime enforcement/illegal activity goes,  having built several databases using bitcoin blockchain data.  It isn't hard to trace the network of people/addresses that interact with each other, once you crack one criminal, you can trace every single interaction he/she's had and take down massive networks of people (again see SR/SR 2).  You don't get sympathy from me because you have to do actual detective work instead of just calling MC/Visa/Prism and raping all of society's data to catch a handful of people.
This is just MC realizing how royally fucked they are and not wanting to adapt.  If they had half a brain, instead of fighting this, they would leverage it to dominate the market and provide a frictionless fungible bridge between all world currencies and their credit system.  Instead of sitting on an outdated financial system that's rotting at it's core, they could be an early, dominate globalized institution that not only profits but brings much needed services to a world that has a desperate need to freely trade and end the economic isolation of third world countries.  
TLDR; Fuck you Mastercard I'm not your property.  You could be a good force in the world, if you only stopped being dicks.

You have to understand the metaphor and the history of the internet.  First, nobody is claiming bitcoin is literally the internet on a protocol level.  So, lets just move past that.
The internet was classified by a lot of mainstream people as "nerdy", "nefarious", and "Wild West".  The technology was clunky and not user friendly.  The connectivity was spotty and slow.  Many people view a world wide network too fragile and unsustainable.  These are the parallels being drawn, none of them meant to be taken literally, but more so as a pattern of behavior exhibited by emergent technologies.
It's not so much a lazy sales pitch, as it is a nod to those of us who recognize the rhetoric from our experience of raising the internet from a bunch of flashing web pages to a replacement for brick and mortar businesses.  All things we were told were impossible.
As a layman explanation, it helps the uninitiated to associate the same convenience they experience with instantaneous world wide content to the convenience of instant (ish) world wide money transfer.  Along with unifying effect the internet had of information sharing being associated with the friction-less globalization of monies and remittances.
Edit: Source: many years of arguing with family members and peers, back in the day, about the viability of the internet, along with yelling at news reporters on TV about their lack of understanding/facts on how it worked.

There are several solutions.  At this point we are no where near hitting that cap, but you are correct that if a large retailer came online we'd have to make an adjustment.  Currently we can do about 600k tranactions an hour (@ 7 tps). we could increase the block size and/or increase the block frequency.  
The block size is the easiest  one and would most likely be the initial solution.  The limitation there would be physical memory on the servers constructing blocks (mining pools, etc).  currently I believe the block size is a 1 MB, so we got plenty of wiggle room on that front.  My server runs 32 GB of ram with room to upgrade.
The next solution would be the block frequency.  This would require lowering difficulty adjusting the reward so the payout is the same (25 btc per 6 minutes on average).  This solution would be a bit more work, but wouldn't require major overhauls to the protocol or the data structure and would most likely be the second course of action.  Assuming competence in the code, we should easily be able to break the 500 - 2000 TPS.
Lastly, would be parallel processing of the block chain and, most likely, wouldn't be utilized until we hit the practical limits of commodity hardware.  This would be the most "expensive" change to the code base.  We would have to switch from a "Chain" (basically a linked list, currently we link the next block to the previous block via the hash) to a tree structure and partition the data processing so that each branch handles a range of transaction by hash signature.  Due to random nature of hashing algorithms, this would create an overall even distribution of transactions across multiple branches of a tree.  This technique of branching would allow each branch to be processed in parallel and scale the network in a N-Tier style.  The limits here would be bandwidth and storage and far beyond even what credit card companies have ever seen.  Done properly, we could achieve tens of thousands of transactions per second.
I'm sure there are other "creative" solutions available out there, but this is how I personally would scale the network, if left up to me.  I hope this helps easy any anxiety about the scalability of the blockchain.  If you have any questions/need me to simplify/breakdown any of the concepts feel free to ask/reply.

Ok here's the basics on how hash rate secures the network.
First a little background/set up.  Each block is a list of transaction combined using a [merkle tree]( This ensures that every transaction is permanently secured into the block using a [hash]( and can not be altered.  A merkle tree has a "top hash" that is combined with a numerical [Nonce]( (a one time use number that is incremented to change the hash in the next step).  
This is where the process commonly called mining (or "Proof of Work") begins.  The header (nonce + top hash + previous block hash &amp; incidental data) is then repetitively hashed, while incrementing the nonce to created different results each attempt, until it satisfies requirements of difficulty.  You can think of difficulty as requiring X number of zeros at the front of the hash to satisfy the proof of work requirement.  Due to the uniqueness of the header and randomness of sha256 hashing, this hashing overall guarantees that, on average, you will have to perform the required amount of effort to create a block acceptable by the network.  The network regulates the difficulty in order to target a block every 600 seconds (10 minutes).  This insures that the release schedule of the 21 million bitcoins happens as outlined by Satoshi.  This is a basic "Fly By" of how mining/network works.
***Ok, with that bit of background, lets talk about how the hash rate secures the network.***  Since difficulty guarantees that you must do certain amount of hashes (on average) to get a block accepted by the network,  it requires that a certain amount of hashing power to control the network, due to the time frame (600 seconds) before the network solves it.  This creates a race between all the miners.  The race happens because of the way consensus on the network works.
The "official" version of the block chain is longest version, that's how we determine who wins a block, if two blocks are submitted at the same time.  The winning chain in the P2P network is the one that meets all the requirements (hash, difficulty, valid transactions, etc) and is the longest.  To be the longest, the chain that is adopted, obviously, has to be built faster than any other competing chains on the network.
All that being said,  a bad actor would have to have more power and be able to create valid blocks faster than the rest of the network (commonly referred to as a "51% attack").  The more powerful the network is the more cost prohibitive this becomes.   As of this moment, the network runs at 264,807,622 gh/s.  If you were able to somehow get enough asics at, for the sake of discussion, lets say $0.50 a gh, it would cost about 132 million USD to do the attack.  This cost barrier protects the network from attack. 
Not only would you have to take the network over, but find a way to profit from it in a negative way.  This is essentially why the hashing power is said to secure the network.
There's a lot more detail to this, but my best effort to concisely explain why gh/s secures the network.
Edit: feel free to ask if you want me to elaborate on any of this or have another question

I put a modest investment into bitcoin for this reason.  Instead of bitching about it, these people should be slowly accumulating a small high risk (in their opinion) cache of bitcoin.  If it succeeds, it will dwarf everything else in a portfolio. If it fails, then your other investments should cover it in the spread.  I think that's what keeps people from completely burying/illegalizing bitcoin.  How many more times can the DOW double every decade?  It's disruption or we stagnate in the same tired policies.

Just as a general practice, you should never setup your network on ISP provided routers. A secondary router should sufficiently buffer your home network from isp routers and DMZ you from any vulnerabilities.
@_date: 2015-05-06 13:41:31
On the hardware side, most importantly you want to differently branded/chip/firmware systems that don't have vulnerabilities that align.  that way malicious code gets isolated on public facing router.  Without a host computer in the DMZ it will have difficulty bridging the two privately networked routers (there are exceptions to this, but it's all about prohibitive cost to target and not being the lowest hanging fruit on the tree).  Hackers are more likely to spam easy attacks on scale than to spend time noodling with a particular target.  Again, if your target value goes up (i.e. you start storing something of real value on your network), you will want to spend more securing it.

"Don't work" or "Aren't Possible" if you are proposing they aren't possible, then I can retort.  by imposing identity reporting requirements on businesses they can in fact find out who does what with which wallets.  So, unless you never get products sent to you, they can in fact know who, what, when and where.  Businesses will never rebel because they carried scaled risk vs. individual risk. so unless you never spend money on anything (which makes your wallet just a file you really enjoy having), then you will be known and taxed as an individual.

The first bank that integrates bitcoin exchange with your bank account wins, imo, with a reasonable cost, of course.  Western Union and such will be absorbed into standard banking in the future digital currency world.  Combined with self-banking, cold storage and wallets.  Minimum, it has to happen during a transitory period between old world and new world banking/asset management.  NYSE desperately needs it for transparent asset management (their current system is smoke and mirrors).  In the end, the global economy can't exist without everyone getting on board with a tech that no one can own.  So if some bank somewhere and some current stock exchanges want to get in on this, it can do nothing but serve humanity for the better.  . . imo

Sorry man is correct. a us citizen who does that is knowingly circumventing the law and can go to jail.  Which is fine, if you are some bat shit revolutionary, but not everyone in bitcoin is, some people just want to legally use it within their country.  You can't expect everybody to do politics or risk their person because  you believe in something they do not.  So go on, blaze your trail, but do it honestly and don't expect that every single other person is willing to follow at the same speed.  Bitcoin isn't political, Bitcoin is code.  It's a tool for some people to be political, and that is fine.  But your right to tell anybody they must be political with their bitcoin is no more valid the government intrusion you so adamantly despise.  Most of us will comply, because we see a middle ground.  We see a peaceful means to accomplish our own beliefs.  So blaze on trail blazer.  I'm going to ride a this slow ass pony I enjoy.

now I question what the btc effect will be too (the greek catch 22 of there only being the cash they have in  hand to trade for anything, btc included), but I do know one thing.  bitcoin as a technology and community has done some surprising stuff with something that in the beginning very few people took serious.  When it first came out, I mean real early on, I ran the client a few days (I was working at a rewards/cc alternative startup at the time) and thought to myself now that is interesting, but it had no real life value assigned to it.  That lil' tech kept at it.  BTC is as relentless and persistent as the community that drives it (or because the community that drives it is).  It kept going and going.  If there is a way for btc to help with uncontrolled (non-governement) liquidity and safe storage of value, it will find a way and persist until it achieves it.  Right now, imo, it boils down to two questions  is there enough cash on hand to do so? and Is there enough understanding/trust in BTC for it to be embraced?  I'm not sure both answers are yes, but I will enjoy finding out and the popcorn is delicious (not to belittle greece's strife, but in a pure intellectual sense.)

Blockchain voting would be trustworthy.  Especially considering how completely screwed security on the US voting machines are currently.  The voter could be issued and registered with a public key and verify his/her votes were counted in the election.  Anyone could verify the tally and validate the chain.  people attempting to use "unregistered" keys would be ignored and black listed.  I personally hope this one day becomes the way it's done.

The thing that pisses me off most about him is he uses those beliefs and, apparently, the exuberant amounts of free time he has, as a giant hammer to relentlessly disrupt the cognitive and thoughtful discussions of others.  
I have no problem with people disagreeing or rational discussion.  The poisonous aspect of luke-jr, imo, is that he will circle jerk his own ideals until no one else gets an opinion.  Any idea not in alignment with his gets pummeled until people start throwing up there hands and walking away.
This is what makes him toxic as a community leader/resident.  A complete lack of social skills, inability to logically/neutrally discuss concepts and ideas, and an OCD level of insistence that everyone not only accept his ideas, but must see his "truth" as being the correct way to think.
He is smart, but he's not the only smart person out there and has real problems accepting alternatives to his way of thinking, especially when it comes to code.  some of the early debates between kano, luke and gmaxwell (around stratum, GetWork, and GBT) are perfect examples of how toxic and disruptive conversations/disagreements with him can be.  Everyone would have gotten to the solution and probably faster without this obsessive need to prove not only his own correctness, but how wrong everyone else's approach was (which it was not).

I personally think that it's about profit opportunity and globalization.  Two things rich influential people really love.  There are parts of it the gov doesn't like, but they do love making money and exercising power, two things of which bitcoin can give them on a global scale.  The buy in is so cheap for bitcoin right now, for people who have that much wealth, that it's almost zero risk.  So, failure being an option, it really doesn't frighten them as much as we think.  The more they get to understand the blockchain, the less scared they will be.  After all the gov calmed down a lot when they realized that silk road basically gave them the entire client list on the blockchain as public record.  now if they find a key they have cryptographic proof of criminal activity.

I hear you peter, but 2 years ago I offered to diagram the entire code base (on bitcointalk), only asking for a simple explanation of how the code is segregated and where the entry points are for different aspects of the system.  I got summarily dismissed and even accused that I wanted information to make another alt coin.  It was so rude, that I just walked away.
The reason we are short on peer review, imo, is that the code base lacks decent commenting and/or documentation.  Project setup, dependencies, diagrams, etc would go a long way towards bringing in more help for peer review, coding contributions and general understanding of the code base.  A bit of investment in this from the core group would pay off a hundred fold in the long run, as the help they need would be more readily available. It is time for documentation and code base to grow up to the degree that is representative of the 4.1 billion in assets it protects.
I have been paid 100s of thousands of dollars for similar documentation by companies, so asking for a bit of time and few pointers from the core devs didn't seem unreasonable to get the ball rolling. (Yes, this peeved me off a bit)  Needless to say, the core dev was the least welcoming opensource community I've experienced.
Each time I hear the core devs complain (not saying you are complaining, but there have been complaints) about not having enough developers, peer review, or open source involvement from the user base, I think of this.  Imagine the documentation, code, and wiki I we could have created by now, if someone had just gotten off their secretive, boys club, high horse for a moment and answered a few questions.
I love bitcoin and wanted to be involved with the code base, but there are other things I can spend my time on and it's the same for many other people.  It would go a long way, if someone in core dev spent a bit of time making a basic how to set up a dev environment in eclipse CDT and what dependencies/source files are needed. I personally would do it with eclipse/ubuntu, as that has the broadest non-windows reach.  It could be as simple as a wiki page.
Anyhow, that's my feedback and personal experience. It's up to you guys, if you want to make participation something that is inviting, or leaving it the way it is.  I suggest the former, otherwise it may be a long wait before help arrives.
I mean this to be as constructive as possible and I hope you guys pay attention.

It does to some degree.  An organization has to hire, provide vision and set goals for developers who are motivate by money.  Open source lives on self motivated individuals that are inspired by the project itself and develop due to self motivation, so such management isn't necessary.  There are developers such as these available, if the platform and the code base itself were more friendly to new talent.  
Not that financially motivated development group couldn't move the project forward or wouldn't be useful, but with all that we lose some agility and centralize decision making.  Not necessarily bad, but it can complicate open source.  See MySQL, cedaga, etc.
Bottom line being, to support for profit development, you need management teams and the overhead becomes expensive.

After the first partial spend, the refund transaction would no longer be valid.  Couldn't Bob hold the remainder hostage at that point?  would you have to create a new one for the change each time?

reposted my thoughts up here for the op:
This is entire thought line is straw man bs. Mostly because the users don't "need" the miners, but the miners need the users. Ask the hundreds of alt coins out there. you make some crap move like "I here by declare miners get more bitcoin." No matter what the reason, users could easily change the hash mechanism and leave the miners standing in the cold.
Even today, there are 10s of thousands of people that would fill that mining vacuum near instantly. In fact there are quite a few people who'd love to see this happen. Why don't the users/miners do this? Because the users are happy with the level of security and service the miners are providing.
If any shenanigans were to ensue on the mining side, we'd quickly and deftly kick them off our chain. The users own the money, the users create the value, and the miners service the users. The miners have huge expenses and investments in gear. They would never jeopardize this with stupidity.
Edit: [Context]( if you would like to read along, we're getting into the protocol itself and why a miner's hashrate has nothing to do with block acceptance.

@_date: 2015-02-24 15:17:30
It's ok man, just trying to help you understand.  
The only impact they can have with their hashrate is to do the infamous "51% attack", which would entail creating a hidden "longer" blockchain, a double spend, be obviously identifiable and has limited application.
The "miners" being replaced are hardware, not entities.  Yes, the mining companies will be swapping their aging hardware with new more efficient asics.  Some of the companies will go out of business due to mismanagement, some will continue on.  The mismanaged companies will be in no position to even do a 51% attack, due to the nature of their mismanagement.  Those who weren't mismanaged have no motivation to do so.
Either way, and regardless of your feelings on the control/ownship of the network, the full network nodes do in fact control consensus and consensus does decide block validity.  Any user can, in fact, run a full node.

@_date: 2015-02-24 14:44:09
No sir, I believe you misunderstand the underlying protocol.  Firstly, the miners can't just declare a protocol change based on their hash rate.  The hash rate allows them to construct and secure blocks that are compliant to the rules of the network.  The majority of network nodes still have to accept these blocks, network nodes are completely separate from hashing of blocks.  All the full node wallets and services establish that consensus, not he who has the most hash power.  This is a common misconception of the protocol.  Miners do not control all things with hashing power, they only secure the blocks.  
What the op was proposing is that some black hat group ("This group makes up 95% of the hashing power on the network. ") would seek to change the rules of game.  Firstly, hashing power alone would not give them this power, secondly if they tried some other means, they would be promptly and unceremoniously removed from the network.  
The private keys (that anyone being responsible with their bitcoins, should be holding themselves)   lock the ownership of the existing bitcoins to the user.   
The full nodes prevent abhorrent blocks from being committed to the chain. (This is why people post things like "I'm running a new full node")  The rules for block acceptance live with the full nodes, not the miners hashrate.  The miners would have to have more nodes than all the wallets, services, and users combined to change the rules of block acceptance and validation.
This is nothing like the gubmint dropping the backing of the dollar.  This is the insurance that allows us "owners of bitcoin" to maintain control and enforce the rules of the game.  Consensus is what democratizes the currency, not hash rate.  You need not even own a large amount or any bitcoins to participate in this consensus.  
The consensus is the only attack vector that would allow these rule manipulations to occur.  And if somebody tried, there would more nodes popping up in a  matter of minutes.  It would be so costly that it's nearly unfeasible, especially as bitcoin grows.

The day might very well come where machines pay us to service, extend function, and code for them. These profit machines would be driven by the need to sell more services to meet market needs.  It's even been tossed around that the data focused versions could live in the "Cloud" and hire coders to expand it's services based on user demand.  In turn selling those services to the user, paying for it's own distributed hosting services, and self scale based on use.  Where there is a profit center, colored coins could be used to self issue stocks for others to invest in the bot itself.  Essentially creating a company that is run by nothing more than demand, lives outside of real world borders and continually evolves by leveraging human resources for evolving/creating services.  
Not sure if it's a good or bad scenario, but it is a possibility.
