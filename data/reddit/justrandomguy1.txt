Im in it since August so Im riding this wave from 10k(highest price that I bought) so Im untouchable right now, bullets cant hit me, I mastered the Matrix basicly. Avg buying price is about 8k now.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:53:18
You can watch from sidelines bruh. I can tell you dont really understand what you are getting into...so educate yourself first then get some satoshis.

I was catching bad vibes from a few channels I came across when I was learning about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:21:53
Every time I buy, the next day price drops holy shit

Will this current global financial system collapse happen in our lifetime is the real question
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:26:14
Okay, I take back this question. My intentions were not to expose, dox anyone. My bad I will delete this when I come home. 
I was trying to get some insight on what this community is all about, does it believe in bitcoin or is it ride to some x price where they would be "rich" in fiat money and the dip out. 
Age question is cuz I keep seeing kinda childish posts. Some cringy meme posts, talking about price of bitcoin all the time. Idk.. I didnt imagine "revolution" to look like this, I guess this is new age revolution like bitcoin is.
