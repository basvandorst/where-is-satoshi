The guy you replied to is clearly an idiot who would probably shoot anyone as soon as they looked at him funny. I agree that a gun would have only made this situation worse than it was. I feel sorry for anyone who is around this fool when he's in possesion of a firearm

Are you just reposting the comments from this thread?

I've heard that electrum seeds work with electrum wallets only though. But isn't it open source  so the software will always be around anyway?

IIRC you can try resending the coins with a high transaction fee and that should take care of it "child pays for parent"
Look at bitcoinfees.21.co for an idea of what fee to use

You could probably check the PGP signature of your wallet using GnuPG. If the signature matches what you see on electrum.org you should be fine

Wow I didn't know that specifically about 0 fee transactions. Guess his best bet is just to wait for the tx to eventually confirm or be refunded back to his wallet
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:20:00
That's exactly what happened and he's doing it to other comments on this thread for some reason
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:28:43
Awesome, see you guys there if anything

Is it necessary to register on the site? I might be close by with some friends who are considering buying BTC

Hey, not to sound like a shill or anything but I'm pretty new to bitcoin and I made my first coin purchase through coinbase. I received my coins 2 days later through bank exchange payment and transferred the coins later to my electrum wallet. The txs went through in about 30 minutes to an hour each and they covered the fees. I guess my question is, are they really that bad? My experience with then has been good so far, but have I just been lucky and it's only a matter of time? I also have an account on local bitcoins but it seems the prices there are way above what I find online elsewhere.

You make a good point. When I sent coin from coinbase to my electrum wallet, both transactions took about 30 minutes to an hour long each. I guess like anything else, it depends on fees and the load to the network. The txs went through quicker than I expected.

Pretty sure he means malicious extensions will try and change the receiving address so that you end up sending your coins to some scammer instead of your wallet without your consent/knowledge
@_date: 2017-01-29 03:40:29
Ah I see. My experience is limited since the few transactions I've made with then have been relatively quick. But I see what you mean. Results will vary I guess

Pretty sure the guy is trolling but I'll entertain his point. Like you mentioned, the risk here is no different than with regular fiat and tolerance for people can vary. Isn't he also assuming that every single person:
1. Has and uses a bank account
2. Keep no cash and/or gold stashed away in their houses or other location
Those are pretty big assumptions to make since he states "nobody keeps stash of cash and gold in the house". Yet people get robbed or burglarized for those things probably on a daily basis (house or not). I agree with the part that if you transfer btc to a wallet controlled by a robber, you're pretty much SOL. Unless maybe the robber is dumb enough to let you use a very low fee; buying you enough time to replace by fee or something to a wallet you control.

Get out of here with the crappy shilling. Old account with no comments for a year until now to promote a shitty alt.

I think your biggest problem is the fact that btc isn't insured by any government entity. It is up to you to take the precautions to secure your coin if theft is really a concern for you. Your logic is that this is more difficult and you can't be bothered to set up an extra wallet with a few bits in it in the event you're robbed.
How is it too difficult to do that? Also, there already exists bitcoin debit cards so your argument of convenience in that regard doesn't hold up much here. You can easily be robbed at gunpoint or have your account passwords stolen and taken for all the cash in your account(s) but the government can bail you out right? Bitcoin was always about 'being your own bank' to minimize central authority. It's understandable though if that is too much responsibility for you to handle.
As for hacking, really any account of yours online can be hacked. This is no different. That's why people here always urge so strongly moving your coins to an offline wallet you control. Again, it is up to you to make sure you're taking enough precautions to avoid all of this 'headache'.

You could just buy some more but buy in fewer increments/amounts. There's an economic principle behind this tactic (forgot the name) but it's spreading out your costs and is better in the long run. Then just HODL.

There we go, thanks for the reminder

Pretty much the exact case I've been using them for. Buy and immediate transfer to electrum PC wallet.

Yes thanks man
