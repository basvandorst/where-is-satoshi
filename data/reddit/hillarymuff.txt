I believe there are many ways to look at this. So for example, say you bought 4 BTC, 1 for $10, another for $15, 1 for $20, and the last for $30. Then you sold 1 BTC for $50. You have several ways to calculate your gain on the sale: 
1) If you choose to apply the First in First Out (FIFO) basis of costing, then you would recognize a $40 gain, as FIFO would indicate that you sold the 1BTC you acquired first (for $10).
2) Conversely, if you chose to use the Last in First Out (LIFO) form of cost relief, then you would recognize a $20 gain (Last BTC purchased for $30). 
3) You could also average the cost of all of your purchases, $18.75 ($75/4) to recognize a gain of $31.25
4) You could also specifically identify any particular cost lot at your choosing. So you can choose to liquidate the $20 cost BTC and recognize a $30 gain.
5) I believe the last way to look at it would be to relieve lots on a high cost or low cost basis. Ie, choosing to liquidate the highest cost lots ($30 in our case) first, or the lowest cost lots first. 
I believe you can you choose any method of lot relief, but as you go back and forth, your personal record keeping may get more complicated. 
It sounds as though you have the information you need to calculate cost at any point in time. 
The above is how I plan on looking at it, but it may all be different if the IRS comes out with rules specific to BTC. For example, I imagine mined BTC would be taxed as ordinary income, while purchased/sold BTC would receive capital gains treatment.
Of course, you should always consult your tax professional, as this is not tax advice, etc etc.

Did Fred from Coinbase just defend and justify the massive cost of BSA, AML rules? Was that just because Coinbase is exceedingly funded and he can afford to protect his market position from startups that can't manage costs of compliance?

Yes, kind of disappointing to hear from the largest player in the US market.

Whether or not there ends up being significant downward pressure on the price, I think this will be very important in the long run. The community is constantly battling uninformed skeptics in addition to regulatory ambiguity. Now we will have an important precedent. The FBI selling seized BTC to the public confirms BTC as a legitimate store of value. Further, the federal government selling BTC publicly should hopefully encourage the government to regulate cautiously. An excessive future regulation which hinders BTC would be a significant PR issue for the feds if they had profited from it handsomely in the past. 
But that's just my .00002 BTC
