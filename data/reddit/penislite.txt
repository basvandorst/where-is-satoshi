This guy gets it.

This is the correct answer.  He was previously CEO of Doge, so he has experience driving multi-billion dollar coins.

I didn't think he was being rude.  And I appreciated his comment, because I actually didn't know what word you meant.
You shouldn't take offense to having your grammar/spelling corrected, because it will help you learn.  Btw, your English seems pretty great to me otherwise.

Can't you use the same private key for both?  In other words, if you import your BTC private key into a BCH wallet, you should have access to those BCH he sent you.

Inb4 the "that's old," "they're dumb," and "their loss" posts. Everyone forgets that Piratebay don't give no fucks. They have all the "fuck you" (or, in this case, "LOL") money anyone could need.

Dude be all like:
"Team, what's the exact opposite of a solid privacy coin like Monero?"
"*A complete lack of privacy where anyone can see everything about a particular purchase.*"
"I love it. Now, let's take it a step further."
"*Instead of a public ledger, only we can see it?*"
"*Instead of being immutable, it's fully editable, but only by us?*"
"Keep fucking going."
"*And then we can manipulate everything, sell all the data, and then pretend it's not a big deal when we're caught, thus making the world a little worse off and making us rich in the process?*"
"Motherfucking bingo. Get on it."

Assuming that there aren't any other issues with the person that ODs on heroin (HIV, Hepatitis, other blood-borne pathogens, or something that would specifically damage a kidney besides the heroine itself), is a kidney from a heroine-overdosed individual all that bad?

The only way it would work is if you can get the government to insure it like they do with banks.  I don't see that happening soon, but maybe one day.  However, then you start losing some of the value that bitcoin inherently provides, i.e. you are your own bank.

NEO is probably my favorite, but it's a little too centralized for some peoples taste.  Kucoin Shares pay out a portion of trade fees, but then you're betting that Kucoin is going to stay relevant, which may or may not be the case in the future with decentralized exchanges.  COSS is similar.  ARK supposedly has some sort of passive income, as well, but I haven't read up on it.  Then there are an abundance of masternode coins.  There's a bunch; I'd recommend Googling "passive income crypto" or something similar and reading some comparison-type articles.

Maybe by hosting a lightning node?  Otherwise, there are some alts that offer passive income.
