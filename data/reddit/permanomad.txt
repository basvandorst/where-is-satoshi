I don't doubt all of that, but if you look closely at what you wrote, you were more insulting to me than 'to Bitcoin'. 
I mean, in all honesty neither Bitcoin nor I are really gonna care all that much about what you think, or the labels you dish out so long as the technology works and adoption spreads, but its the level of respect you show other humans and the assumptions by which you judge them that really affect their reactions. Especially when we don't communicate face to face.
Which is why a lot of your viewpoints come across as FUD and casually stating you know what you know because of "subjective unprovable evidence X and appeal to ridicule Y". Well... pull the other one son, its got bells on.

But there has to be a sell order comparable to the liquidity offered in order for the price to remain static. 
The Marshalls essentially received the coins they have for nothing and are asking at market price, off-exchange. The profit they make is going directly to an independent actor, not the thousands of Silk Road users. Imo, the market already built in that selling price drop when Silk Road was seized back in october.
And yes, conjecture aside its the opportunity of a lifetime for the concerted coin fiend.

If you've been trolling: good for you, you did pretty well ;) If not:






I'm gonna go so far as to say you have figuratively created a new logical fallacy: the Entrenchment Fallacy.
Besides loading your argument with invective and hoping that it scares the reader into submission, there really isn't much to go on. Maybe that kind of talk would work on a trade floor or over the phone to a potential layman investor, but you gotta bring something else to the table here buddy.
Maybe you really do operate in a high tech industry of fast returns and quick decisions, but human society doesn't work like that. Culturally people are wary to take on new unprecedented ideas until the herd has decided collectively it is safe. Don't ask me why we are like that. The more widespread the change it can effect, the slower the onset of that concept, IMO.
So yes its early days, but appealing to ridicule won't make the fiat money system any less ridiculous. Sound money should be worth supporting.

What does that have to do with anything? And does domestic violence not count if there are legal intoxicants involved?
I understand you were maybe trying to be funny, but it always strikes me as odd how other people are quick to jump on the 'drugs make people violent' bandwagon when the most listings on SR are always by far and away for 
1. Prescription drugs
2. Cannabis
3. Psychedelics
in that order. Not what you would call anger-inducing substances. We have laws for violence against others, drugs should come with a warning on how to use them and then sold legally, just the same as we do with alcohol.

You have climbed a tree and are trading money for products with 5 of your friends in different trees via snapchat. Pigeons are delivering the goods, no one is hurting anyone, the trees are yours, and so is the money.
Suddenly a huge jock appears with 50 equal sized men, all of them with baseball bats and shotguns. They shoot the pigeons, take the money and say "All this is ours now, if you want the money we took, you are free to come and get it within the next 3 days." You climb down, alone, from your tree and watch the gang recede into the distance.

Hence if we extend the chain then it would take longer before it gets exchanged, so the real thing we need is not so much adoption but education. And we all know that most people need a few attempts to hear something and understand it before the idea takes root.
I really believe that in future it won't be exchanged by anyone, but how long this takes, nobody knows. Seems I've been hodling for the longest time.

I guess I misunderstood what you meant when you said 'booth babes'. This is something we don't really have so much in Scandinavia, but I think I understand now.
My point (which is now probably not related to yours any more) is that some women choose to look at other women flaunting themselves and say 'why do they not have more self respect?' rather than merely 'that human is choosing to expose themselves'.

Welcome to Keynesian economics 101.


Although this may be true for a fiat currency, time and again this argument has not been proven correct in the case of Bitcoin. In any case, an economy needs a level of saving in order for the purchase of big ticket items. Constant spending and an endless credit supply exacerbate the fundamental problem over the long run: that you cannot artificially create markets and hope to retain the balance for ever.

I'm with you in theory, but its a very radical (and somewhat unrealistic) stance to assume a completely all-or-nothing end scenario.
For a long time bitcoin has occupied a niche in the black market, and it has been growing at a steady pace. Seeing as the cryptography is secure and the ecosystem overall is growing, without all out banning from most governments that growth can still carry on, but there is still value to it being transacted in the way it was in the first few years: through Silkroad and the darknet (and who knows, that could even grow exponentially too in time through OpenBazaar). This is the niche I am talking about, and it will still be a multi billion $ market.
So to say the acceptance from the mainstream economy is needed is false imo, as a currency like bitcoin will exist and thrive quite easily in either one or both.

1. The USD is not the only currency in circulation. Arbitrage is in my view a legitimate way to make money.
2. The price of bitcoin is a market function, in that the protocol itself is stable, and thats all that matters. Billions of people around the world can benefit from this, not just the west.
3. The fact that many businesses are thriving right now using bitcoin, and there is an entire black market supported by it, shows that people are willing to spend.
We seem to lose sight of the fact that for almost the entirety of recorded history until the 20th century, people could not simply create money and give it value out of thin air. Saving was commonplace and the way to buy larger ticket items. 
THIS is what really creates stability in an economy, not simply that a large central institution (or cabal of them) places a big rubber stamp on a vast pile of electronic numbers, then points a gun at the populace and says "trust us, its worth something".

Its not that paying the money out of *choice* is a bad thing, its just that there is a monopoly on the institution that spends it, and that its involuntary. Its good that the Swedish State appears to be doing a good job so far with the funds it takes, but a free market in public services with competition would be even better: you would find that prices for the consumer drop down as efficiency improves. Again, something that Bitcoin would make easy.
Just for the record, I live in Scandinavia too and would have no qualms paying for public services in a free market.

But if it is designed to draw from a lower potential, it will draw more current, and the fuses in Europe will be set to a lower current. Chances are thought that depending on the house the mains should be able to take it.

I went to take a screenshot of the addresses and then get another one with the same address on the blockchain, but for some reason my wallet has deleted all the extra pockets I created. All gone. Even after I restored from seed, then it seemed to delete even more.
I'm not making this stuff up... why would I? They even say when you try it, this is alpha and use it at your own risk.
My only hope is my experience helps the devs to get it sorted so others dont experience what happened to me. But also yes, if any dev knows how to fix it that would be great too!

That would need the network to revert to that coin, which after the massive inflow of capital into the infrastructure would need bitcoin to have a serious fundamental flaw or catastrophic failure of some kind. Theres not enough incentive otherwise.
The rewards are good enough with bitcoin as the price rises. Sidechains also could solve a lot of technical issues.

The interval period between news and price jumping can be longer than you think.. not everyone is sitting at their computers with their fingers on the buy button, and those making the decision still have to weigh in on whether they want to research into btc first. Those who do decide to buy still have to sort the transfer out, which entails the usual waiting period on fiat movements. 
It could be a week or two before the real action begins.

There is currently a low evolutionary filter for douchebags operating within this ecosystem. We as the herd have to co-evolve our ways of interacting with the (potential) predators, like developing multisig kickstarter systems etc. Seeing as how bitcoin was designed to be trustless, there is no reason why its infrastructure has to conform completely to that of the dinosaurs.

I live in Denmark.
It is fair to say that the government here is definitely interested in bitcoin. Some big decision makers for the central bank, tax authority and others sat down with Lasse (the fellow from Coinify and Bitcoin Nordic in the article) in 2013 to discuss policy towards bitcoin. Dont forget also that earlier this year the Liberal Alliance party experimented in blockchain technology when holding their own internal elections, so all in all its fair to say there is a definitively positive attitude towards the new cryptocurrencies and the technology behind them.
Although I'm an ancap myself, its difficult often to comprehend just how liberal the state is here. Still, getting pretty tired of naysayers spouting off by default without understanding the facts on the ground. Guess it shows how divisive of a topic this is.
@_date: 2014-01-21 08:17:36
I think you might be right, but at the same time thats a bit of a generalisation. There are plenty of people out there who are saving, but we don't exactly teach children that virtue as a culture, so its kinda hard to tell. I remember my mother telling me to save the loose pennies for a rainy day, and I basically ignored her advice until bitcoin came along.

I have to disagree. Only on the peripheral areas since the crisis (Greece, Portugal etc) has there been any kind of economic impact that would render the average citizen in danger of not having credit available. Sure, Hungary and Serbia had some levels of inflation at one stage but that doesn't even register on the radar compared to other places.
Most of the social infrastructure is still in place throughout the continent such as roads, healthcare, education, and to a widespread degree, available credit. Even austerity is being fought tooth and nail by the populaces. They dont have to face life without money, credit cards, banks or support like the majority of the people in the world have to.

IMO its too early for the full story. Too bad markets react so fast to news like this, I would have given it a little bit more time before writing off Neo &amp; Bee completely. They seemed like they had good intentions.
And lets bear in mind that it wouldn't take a lot for someone with a vested interest and plenty of reseources to cripple a new bitcoin startup, especially one which competed directly with the legacy banking sector, and so soon after MtGox and all the FUD that followed.

Interesting. Its a very good point, and as devil's advocate I'm finding it hard to come up with counter arguments!
So basically, the market regulates itself regardless. But wouldn't the companies facing recriminations only be forced to action because they would be facing opposition ultimately from the state? Which then itself has to provide a semblance of action against descriminatory firms to avoid social upheaval? And the influence of technology?
Its probably very difficult to quantify how much these varying anecdotal scenarios have an effect through time on a market.
Edit: just for the record, I'm an ancap. Supply and demand should completely drive the market!

You cant pay people with something you dont have. If you have the coins, they can be given to the employees. If not, well it makes sense to lower prices for their products in order to earn more.
People will come around. There is already a black market running on bitcoin, so its not like there is zero adoption. Its mainly just the price fluctuation which puts people off right now, other than that its a superb way of doing business.

That process has nothing to do with bitcoin itself. If you have bitcoin, good for you, go ahead and enjoy the benefits. It is voluntary after all. Your argument works simply because of the exclusionary nature of our current banking system.

Couldn't agree more. One utopian (read: 'perhaps naïve') vision I have in the future is a world of self-governing communities based around what our biology can deal with naturally (150-200 individuals) that are self-sufficient and trade with those next to them in a decentralised federation style-situation. Fuck knows getting to that point would involve a lot of bloodshed though, but it would be vastly more profitable and peaceful I think than these overgrown monstrosities that squat and milk the herds like cattle.

Shouldnt BCC start from 0 then move up from there? Seems wrong to designate an arbitrary value for the coin from nothing at all then sell it afterwards.

Thats ok, you are forgiven, and this is true until you consider that that last 8,000 years (post-agricultural revolution) is less than 5% of our total history as a species. So one could be forgiven for believing that the standard narrative of 'Kings Landing cut-and-dagger greed' might not be what we evolved for. Plus theres the fact that for a long time, we were a lot weaker than our mesolithic ancestors - sure, a lot of them died, but mainly *as a direct result of* the diseases borne of agriculture and civilised communities when humans grouped together in dirty, stressful conditions without the varied diet and routine of a hunter gatherer.
You could summarize my argument with an example of when anthropologists bring endigenous people from hunter gatherer communities to urban connurbations to observe their reactions, almost unanimously it is one of amusement and gentle horror. "Sure, you have more things," they say, "but look at the price you pay; you work 60-80 hours a week, you dont know you're neighbours and hardly spend time with your families, and the stress of it all is often completely unbearable. You dont seem any happier - is it worth it?"

The narrative at the time was that the bail ins in Cyprus forced people to flee with their money to bitcoin, causing an unprecedented rise in price. 
The reality is that the main exchange, Mt. Gox, had a bot running (later named Willy) which 'bought' bitcoins at a very fast rate for several months, thus creating artificial demand which helped the price to rise. The same happened in November of that year with the run up to $1200.

2. Set precedent for sovereign governments to take on vast private debts.
3. System crashes once said sovereign entities themselves become insolvent.
4. Buy stocks and bonds for pennies on the dollar.
5. See no. 1. above.

But it *is* the value amount, as banks don't need to send lots of small transactions to each other, they settle their accounts in the billions of $.
Those 'blockchains' they are developing are private, and so are not really any different from what they do right now. They'd still have to issue contracts for who got to use them, so it would still take time for money to move between members. Trustless networks are faster :)

The individual transactions can be as large as you want. The largest btc transaction was in the region of hundreds of millions of dollars - perfect for inter-bank settlements. Sure theres some issue with the blocksize now but it doesnt have to be perfect right this minute. Even if an international money transfer between banks had to wait its turn going through the bitcoin network, on average it would still be so much faster than the monetary transfer system in place right now.
[This post]( was quite insightful as to how bitcoin makes sense for banks to use, considering the difficulties of transferring money between different institutions :)

I think anarchism is a perfectly natural political function of the human organism, but that our current cultural systems inherently disenfranchise any true autonomy of the self.

Thats all fine, but we should be aware that demographics of voting populations have had a major part to play in our drug policies in the last 60 years.
The Silent Generation is almost gone now, and as the Baby Boomers die off and Generation X and the Millennials come to dominate politics over the next 30 years, we will see a very radical shift in the way societies in the west (and probably the wider world) view personal freedoms, human rights and the myriad of socio-political effects that arise from international and domestic drug policies. The internet and the increasing momentum of the Open Source Revolution will enable this change in a powerful way.

Ok a lot of points worth going into here and I hope this will make sense as several will be rather abstract.


I dont despise fiat currency - its a viable medium of exchange - I despise the people fucking with it. 
This is simply the way I see it:
Gold has been a traditional store of value and as an exchange medium, granted, but we dont know how much there is of it still in the earth, and we have at best a vague idea of how much could be being held in various places at any one time (if you go by the figures quoted recently from various sources). If you have it in your hands, good for you, but try to move it around over the earths surface in any amount and you run into problems. Even governments are prone to stealing from people in order to increase their supply.
With bitcoin things are different. The currency is basically a reward for how much energy you spend 'mining' it, or essentially how much heat you are willing to produce through your processing power in solving the complex algorithms that provide you with Btc, (and also your own manpower to a small extent). That energy may come from fossil fuels, nuclear, renewable and so on, so there are plenty of options available over the next 4 years, but once we convert that energy to heat it is very difficult to convert back. The currency itself is cryptographically created which means it is virtually impossible to hack, subvert etc. A limit is set on it to avoid inflation and hold its value. Transactions are anonymous and instantaneous. 
So here we have a currency that is created through the entropic processes of the universe, is decentralized and has a definable, limited supply, and is also very secure and relatively easy to use for the end user (provided they have an web connection). Transactions are fast and free. Call me a crazy person, but I'd prefer to use something like this rather than go back to the gold standard. To me, it seems to fill the requirements as a secure method of exchange and store of wealth *once it finishes fluctuating in price.* What is limiting this right now is open for debate, possibly the limited awareness and/or skepticism of the general public.
With regards to your point on beneficial economics in the future, 'proof of work' is the concept driving Btc creation now, but isnt conserving a rainforest or lowering carbon emissions more useful to a society than just the amount of fuel burned? It could also be this kind of 'work' that could get rewarded. IMO that would be a way forward for a society that wanted to make a difference, and backing a cryptocurrency with these values makes sense in the long term considering the problems we face globally. I cant imagine elephant poachers, illegal loggers or polluting companies continuing what they do if they saw their money directly going down in value as a result.


The inflation during the Gold Standard which I believe you are addressing (and admittedly I am not an expert on by a long shot) came at a time of great socio-political change during the early 20th century. The Federal Reserve was set up in 1913 also, which has interesting consequences for the market fluctuations in the 20s and 30s. It has been said they were the ones who inflated the money supply too, but again I wouldnt know so much about that. My guess is that the nature of the gold supply lead inflation to occur along with interesting antics at the young Fed.


I do agree with you here and we could talk about the rise of the petrodollar as the world reserve currency for hours probably, but at the end of it we wouldnt find a solution for the struggling average american. Its their purchasing power that is eroded over time, as is the ability for their kids to have the same standard of living their parents or grandparents did.
I think the overall result of the deregulation and fiscal policy has led to people to find solutions that put the money back into the hands of the people again, solutions like bitcoin. So legislation and regulation have everything to do with the monetary policy, it seems to me. Sure, one can get rich quick, but *wealth* will transfer itself between mediums in order to perpetuate. So we will see big money move into bitcoin, but when the supply is reached, things could begin to move around. Hell, even before that probably. Who knows, if btc is the new gold, we might get another cryptocurrency more like silver that we can also trade with.
Edit: thanks for putting up with the wall of text. I appreciate the discussion a lot.

Totally agree. Law and order is something we need: authorities we can rely on to mediate in disputes who aren't corrupt or working against our interests.
I think we can agree that the main problem is that wasteful state institutions don't have an *incentive* to be more efficient. After all, there is no competition, is there? In a free market scenario, companies work damn hard to secure capital from their customer base, the State doesn't need to do that as they just throw you in jail if you don't pay your taxes :)

Thanks for your patience. What I got from that is this:
My blockchain funds got accessed by my QT wallet in order to obfuscate funds being sent in the blockchain. QT accessed the online wallet as I accidentally imported the private key (when experimenting noob-style) into both wallets. It sent the finds to itself to a 'change' address which is in QT but is not shown. I would have to go through a relatively elaborate process right now to actually access said funds but if I choose to sit tight, at some point a correction to QT coding will return the funds safely to my QT wallet at some unspecified point in the future.

Tbh, its a fair assumption to suggest that the government/tax man will want to get their hands on what they think they're owed, but the question is how? Right now btc is in its infancy, so maybe it makes more sense to tax the big businesses and not the small people. How do you strong arm 50,000 people at once, for example, when its just easier to tax the transactions going through a large company, then that company puts a commission onto their rates.

Honestly, money has no business in politics. Once our politicians are free to do politics instead of fundraising and gerrymandering, maybe something can get done. Then just maybe there might not have to be actors and spindoctors flooding governments everywhere.
I like the look of Lawrence Lessig's political kickstarter project idea. If we could crowdfund the politicians we wanted and their actions, it would only be a matter of time before the system changed for the better. Of course in my view the better option would be a direct democracy, but baby steps.

Thats a load of golden bollocks, there are plenty of people who would pay to support their communities, we just have to devolve power down to a more local level so they can see where their money is going... create a community spirit. Instead your solution to changing the uncompromising lumbering bureaucratic system is to use the very same one that got us to this point? That doesnt make much sense... 
Democracy as it stands seems to me to be a collective cop-out, and a representative system it certainly is not - its merely rigged to favour rich-upper middle class white boys with connections. As if they want to change things at that level? 
People who argue in favour of a statist solution are blind to the writing on the wall. They dont want to look after you when they voted get in, and theres not even consequences for going back on election promises. I'd rather vote with my feet and not vote.

And so it was the young troll witcoins, leaving home for the first time, set off for the fertile plains of Bitcoinia. He had been cast out form the other lands, but he had heard this one was tolerant enough to allow his kind to enter and dick around wasting everybody's time. 
He knew his journey would be an arduous one, fraught with difficult interactions and dangerous encounters along the way, as the land was filled with all kinds of strong and brave people, a lot of them dedicated to spreading truth and innovation. Part of him was jealous that they could speak amongst one another with such friendliness and confidence, using all manner of speech that he couldn't understand quite just yet.
'Freedom, heh', witcoins snorted in disgust as he hefted his little crypto-club, vowing never to allow this to happen. So what if they laughed at him, he thought, as a dribble of snot dangled slowly from his left nostril, he would show them! They would all be feeding him their lubbly-jubblies eventually. He farted gently, standing perfectly still for a second. Then he picked up his sack of failed arguments and headed off for the plains, its forums gleaming in the distance.

Definitely behind ending lobbying; the problem is, will it ever happen? And what then? How do we keep the money out of politics once its out? A problem half solved is sometimes a problem doubled imo.
The real issue in my view is the existence of the government itself. The way that the State legitimates itself and its actions is the reason things have got this far anyway, and there doesn't seem to be a reliable method of changing things unless revolution is on the cards, and that won't be nice for anyone unless we can avoid violence (but something the state has proved they are *more* than willing to engage in, as proved during the Occupy movement).
People say to me, "just move to a new country". Great. Not like all the land is taken already by the various thieving governments. Seasteading might be the best option in international waters, but you let me know when they have a giant floating city capable of supporting itself ready to set sail and I'll put my name on the waiting list.

*Explain it like I'm 5.*
 
 heres the thing:
Aside from taxation, governments issue bonds - IOUs - to raise money. They have many different ones which range from the short term (eg. 2 year bonds) to the long term (eg. 50 year bonds). At the end of this period they have to pay their debt to the holder, including the interest.
In this way, governments are like companies that people can invest in. We call it 'government paper' and the financial arena in which they are traded is the 'bond market'. The interest rates on the various types of bonds fluctuate according to how the market sees the desirability of those bonds, so the less a government is perceived to be able to pay the interest on a loan, the higher the interest goes up on the bond rate in order to be more enticing to speculators.
The market threw a recent violent temper tantrum within the last month following Ben Bernanke's announcement (Whoops! Take-backs? No keepsies Benny-Boy!) of tapering the Quantitative Easing policy which has been liquidating the struggling financial markets for the last 4 years.  This has led to what many have called a pretty decisive end to the last 30 year bull market (a positive market where returns are likely) in bonds. On an even scarier note, it has proved that we are a lot closer to the brink of collapse than a lot of people thought...
Hold on to your hats, fellers, cos this ride is gonna get more than a little hairy.

I never said it would prevent stuff happening, its merely a safeguard. Bitcoin is a protocol, not a legal system.

Straw man fallacy. I didnt say money wasnt evolving into an intangible entity (which is good in the case of Bitcoin), and you can argue as much as you like but this isnt in itself related to how much people understand the workings of money. It simply represents (in the case of fiat) that there is a group of people willing to circumvent democracy, derailing the hard fact that capital's value is linked to the entropic forces of the physical universe, thereby profiting forthwith. 
To my mind Bitcoin is a departure from this awful state of affairs as its security and survival is dependent upon a certain collectively supervised energy consumption, which if were removed would mean its demise. Once a person understands this basic premise, which is simple if explained correctly, its almost as if some natural propensity for the comprehension of value comes online, like a light. I've seen this happen many times in person!
And for the record, I dont believe in gold as a store of value either, but others do and I was outlining the fact that humans seem to have an inherent ability to determine value for themselves. If this means we are culturally hardwired for this kind of knowledge, I dont know. I was simply theorising.

Once again, more assumptions. In the city where I live (not in UK and I wont say where), for example, if you asked most people they would say they are happy paying their taxes. Theres no need to romanticise the 'country bumpkin' scenario. Of course, as you say *too* big and people lose contact to one another. But I would argue its doable up to 200k-300k. The population size of Iceland, for example.

I feel the problem more lies in the fact that feel so apathetic towards the system, and that there is no real representation. The system should be a representation of us, not us trying to slot into the system, wouldn't you say? As a believer in the positive sides to humans, I think when we give people responsibility to take decision for themselves, quite often we get a positive outcome. The question is really taking that step to give people more choice in the matter, not spurring them on to greater efforts in pointlessness. And yeah, opening the culture up somehow to more creative efforts in daily life, but as always theres no magic bullet or overarching parent that is around to help us. The only real way I believe is to turn our backs on it. We have to get on and do it, stop voting, start doing.

Anthropological evidence from recent years is tending to suggest that these 'small communities' you describe are far more egalitarian than western culture would have you believe. In small communities, people who cheat, steal, or don't share are very quickly identified by the group. Cooperation within small communities far outweighs the benefits of one-upmanship through cheating or stealing.
Don't think modern western culture is the pinnacle of our evolutionary social standards - its been going this way for only roughly 5,000 years of our 120,000 year existence as a species!

If what you say is correct, the funds are in QT and theres no problem. The real issue that has been bugging me is one of security. My blockchain wallet is linked to my phone with google authenticator etc, so its a pain in the ass if I have to get a new one (or is it, probably not lol), but my blockchain about is empty and it will stay that way for now. Technically is there a chance this will happen again? Is there a way to remove an address (the annoying double-imported one specifically) from either QT or the blockchain wallet?

Yes but the entire economy runs very much on petroleum. There are alternatives to this as an energy source but nothing that will unilaterally make things as simple and as easy as oil.
Sure, renewables are becoming far more viable on the household scale, but a society-wide revolution in green energy is not on the cards for the US just yet. Europe, maybe if they get their act together, but the political and economic climate is not one that aids green energy expansion in the America right now.

firepacket didnt say that currency has to be completely stable, but that it *should not inflate*. These things are completely different.
Your argument that spending is good for the economy is also a libertarian concept believe it or not, but you still hinge it all on the redundant precept of 'growth', which provides 'jobs', which in turn relies on positive interest, or inflation, being a major part of the economy. 
Sick and tired of your dollars being worth less land less as the years go by? Theres nothing wrong with a simple life of peace and prosperity: we dont have to become Soviet Russia, and we dont have to all turn into neoliberal yuppies either.
Look up the idea of the Gift Economy. [Sacred Economics]( by Charles Eisenstein is a great free ebook which details many of the ways we can have our monetary system work for us and the positive things we wish to achieve on this earth.

Peter has been around a long time in the financial markets and has made a lot of money in exactly the field that bitcoin is entering into. I think this is why his points are simultaneously so salient yet so biased.
I think he underestimates the technical wizardry of this open source, decentralised, disruptive movement. The bitcoin devs and community have at their core a group of people who not only want to profit, but are determined to uphold freedoms for everyday people at all costs. In my opinion, the contemporary money markets as we know them very much lack the latter. Could this be the deciding factor in bitcoin's success compared to precious metals?

Forgive me my friend, sometimes my negative side can get the better of me unwillingly after a long day. By the looks of things I've been upvoting you a lot more than anything else... but anyway.
Listen, when I try to explain things the way I see them and provide a theory as a future solution, I'd expect apathy and a certain level of derision in certainly to a high degree and in a few other places depending on the subscribed readership. Places it may be received well could be and perhaps even here, after all cryptocurrency is changing the world, albeit slowly.
Its not you I'm upset over personally. Its just the level of 'we dont get a say in anything and thats the way its gonna always be' fucking hopelessness swamping a lot of the world lately that makes me want to literally *puke blood* sometimes that it hurts. And thats not a personal opinion as such, thats more of a widespread zeitgeist on a cultural level. I hear it from my friends, I hear it from my parents etc, etc.
So forgive me for being a little rude, its not your fault. I can pull a  spiky one with my own opinions sometimes. Thats a personal fault and I'm working on it. Perhaps its just cause I view bitcoin and perhaps even this sub (somewhat naïvely perhaps) as a small bastion of like minded people when it comes to economic freedoms and how we can work on them. The internet, bitcoin, a mind full of hope and ideas - these things are all game changers. We were made for so much more than this lazy, uninspiring, wage slavery uselessness. Being sarcastic and combative isnt gonna help, and you're right, so... my apologies. Lets keep fighting that good fight in some other way. All power to you.

Paul Krugman entered the bathroom and looked in the mirror, placing his flowery embroidered briefcase on the floor.
Reaching up and pulling off the mask, a triumphant Max Keiser stood gazing back, a cavalier expression of mischievousness pasted upon his dishevelled visage.
Taking the mask, he levered a seemingly innocent looking toothbrush in a holder, and a section of the wall slid away smoothly, dry ice flowing around the edges. 
He walked up to the wall and hung the mask on a hook next to several others. The faces of Christine LaGuard, Vladimir Putin, Rush Limbaugh, Edward Snowden, Carrot Top, Carl Sagan, and others were all neatly arranged on the wall. In the gloom behind were what looked like stasis tanks filled with humanoid figures. Machines hummed quietly, little lights blinking.
He walked out again, loosening his tie, and joined Stacy Herbert in the kitchen downstairs, the door sliding back into place with a click.
"Looks like some more cheap coins for Christmas, baby," he said, grinning roguishly, slapping a copy of the New York Times on the counter.
"Fantastic. Oh honey, could you feed the [tapirs]( she said, opening a bottle of champagne, "I think they look hungry."
Max turned to her.
"Let them eat cake."

Then the price will go down, allowing people with a stock up to buy on the cheap. Its a cycle that will eventually right itself. 
When people realise how stable cryptocurrencies can be in the *long term*, things will settle into business as usual. They have to. You may be looking at this like fiat currencies may be around for ever, but looking at it logically the centralised and heavily inflated currencies of governments around the globe are on borrowed time. Add this to a switch over to milliBitcoins when the time arises, and I think you've got the recipe for Bitcoin's success on a day to day basis.

On the one hand; the libertarian nature of it is appealing, as is the utility of it; on the other hand, the disruption to the old order will bring a giant pain in the ass for his business in the future.

@_date: 2013-12-12 11:46:01
Yeah, and I agree with you there to an extent. I think that we haven't... whats the word... 'devolved' our ideas again? In the past we might have needed that territory or private property *as a group* or in interconnected kinship groups for survival. Far better to share resources you don't need through altruism.
How long does it take for the memes to spread that we live in post-abundance? Too much inequality for that to happen right now. Best stick to free market principles until we're ready to take it to the next level. All I can see is theft on a grand scale if we choose otherwise.
But cheers MFA, I will definitely check out the audiobook :)
Edit: you might also want to check out this free ebook by Charles Eisenstein called [Sacred Economics]( It deals with more or less the same issues, gift economies, and how we can tailor the current money supply in our favour. I tried to convince him of the benefits of Bitcoin when I met him at a conference, but he was skeptical. I think we can marry a lot of his ideas to cryptocurrency in the future.

My guess is there needs to be some kind of user friendly application before more widespread adoption takes place. I'm thinking a cheaper, easy to use hardware wallet (like Trezor, but cheaper) which integrates easily with various media and consumer interfaces, a rethink of the address system perhaps to make them easier to use/remember for the average user, or Coinkite-style cards without the fairly high fees etc. 
There are so many ideas that could be implemented, it could be one of the major early corporate adopters that develop them (or at least move serious funds behind them). Humans move slowly though. My guess is 2015-16 before the really high prices arrive.

This video is like a chapter from a Keynesian economics text book. What it fails to point out is that the banks and financial industry had much bigger part to play in the crisis than human nature. It was *them* that lobbied for the important regulations to be removed, *them* that preyed upon people for predatory loans and it was *their people* who got the CDOs all classed AAA when they knew they were complete junk. To downplay or ignore their role is disengenuous at best and beneficial to their continuing cronyism and corrupt practices at worst.

This, many times over. If you look at it, *everything* is by default a store of value and therefore *also* a means of exchange. its just a question of how fast the universe degrades it naturally. With Btc though, that issue is circumvented... until further notice.
It will take some big money investment and a lot of organic growth for the majority of businesses to make the switch. What is needed is educating people about how awesome this whole thing is. Imagine a government going all in...

Money or a means of exchange that holds it value is crucial to any society; the corrupt industry and the major players that have grown fat via the fiat fiasco we have now are not as 'immensely productive and important' as you might think.

Well your scenario would be true if it weren't for the two things;
* A free society would have 'private law' based around on contracts derived from private property. This includes the goods and services that companies provide. If a company withheld these, they would quickly be held to account through breach of contract. The market would also provide arbitration services that would act as third parties in these disputes. Again, these would be private companies seeking to maximise their efficiency and competitiveness through providing a fair service.
* Running a monopoly in a free market is *incredibly costly*: so costly in  fact as to be not profitable. We must remember that a free market is very good for competition, as that is what drives its efficiency. To obtain a monopoly, one must have an incredible amount of luck and help from an entity that makes the laws and thus keeps competition to a minimum... yup, you guessed it: the State! Either way, private enterprises that operate with foul play in mind quickly gain a reputations for this and find themselves pushed out of the market.
In both cases we see (indeed, it is empirically *provable*) that in a scenario of market anarchy, it is far more profitable to simply cooperate and behave appropriately, as society has far more wealth to spread around owing to the lack of taxes.

Yeah thats the lie of the land as it stands currently, but thats not to say that we couldnt change the rules. Unfortunately it would take plenty of people to pay attention for once rather than give in to convenient distractions. The way I see it, distributed networks have far more power than old school centralised ones. Good old human ingenuity should trump corruption eventually given a good enough system. It stands to reason - the internet can help change all this.
@_date: 2013-08-25 06:00:03
I'm not sure I'd say I am a 'true blue' anarchist as such, as I think a lot of the time people see anarchism as a state whereby people govern themselves, whereas I feel the power of distributed networks trumps any vague assumption that humans can overcome their biology and destructive tendencies as individuals. Perhaps this is possible in the far future, but I feel its better to keep our feet on the ground and realise that the more we distribute regulation and decentralise power the more prosperous and healthy human society can become. I'm not sure if this fully equates with the definition of anarchy as some would have it.

But cant you see that we are a product of our environment... throughout history in various times and locations, the specific definition of 'human nature' would have been totally different depending on who you spoke to. All systems that exist (ecosystems, economic systems, biospheres, political spheres, cultural areas etc) mould the behaviour of the organisms within it.


There is an inherent danger is putting too faith in external phenomena and thus disenfranchising oneself from the power we have as individuals and communities - by that I mean saying 'thats just the way it is' is NOT GOOD ENOUGH. The human being is an animal capable of dealing with a wide range of sociological wetware, using multiple languages at once, mastering tool craft and complex problem solving, whilst at the same time remaining maleable in its cultural plasticity - and this is the normal state of affairs we were evolved for. 
Try and deny it: go to India or other places and see how they cope with 4 languages, several religions, dangerous animals and deadly natural environmental disasters all within a 10 mile radius of their home. You say a lot of people may be useless 'eaters' or whatnot, I say no they are just not fulfilling their full biological and mental potential just yet. There need to be more challenges to life, perhaps becoming more politically autonomous (ie being allowed to finally *grow the fuck up* by the 'authorities') could be the one for our generation.


Well if you look around you, people seem to be getting pretty upset about the shit thats going down in plenty of different countries. I dont think I should need to provide anyone around here with a list.


Yeah and thats fine and dandy, but pretty soon they might be in a minority. I dont know the time frame on it, but when the financial system brings everything to a head in the near future - and it will - the people who just sat around believing it would go on forever are probably gonna be wondering what the fuck happened.

Not when the risk is conveyed to anyone other than the investor. Thats the point he's making: right now we're socialising the costs of banking risks and this is undemocratic and fraudulent. Capitalism should be about shouldering your own burdens when you make mistakes, just like what happens in small businesses. When they go bust, they dont get bailed out  by the government - why should it be any different for banks who did very fraudulent activities?

Yes and I think this is a phenomenon confined to the early years. People can spend their Btc now, but its just getting started for the average joe in many ways. I think when the wave breaks a few years from now, Btc will stabilize and be the most valuable cryptocurrency out of a handful of several, then perhaps another contender will appear backed by a different value (implemented green innovation for example, or environmental conservation - the challenge here is quantification/verification) which society might get behind. It would depend on the values being aspired to, but again this is just my speculation on the future in a decade or so.
So... given your stance on the gold standard, what do you make of the increasing fiat craziness since 1971? Inflating an unbacked money supply whilst not allowing wages to go up seems a little silly, no? It seems like its the rampant inflation thats the problem, not the saving. These days the banks want to transfer all the risks to the customer and avoid any ramifications themselves.

Again, you'll have to forgive me my friend but you must be more specific. The government system we have is a majority agreeing upon who should be in control of taking money from people.
Its better to say that individuals will always govern *themselves*. Its not like a human being shuts down or goes insane when they are left alone somewhere with no one to tell them what to do - they look after themselves; they will build, forage, breed, and do pretty much everything without someone else telling them what to do. 
Its actually the ones who don't want to be productive and would rather take things without asking that tend to want to reinforce the idea of the need for rule, not that we automatically create class systems and rulers. How lucky for them that the State apparatus already exists! ;)

I'm not saying I disagree, but we should be clear right now that this whole argument was the driving force behind a lot of the economic woes we face today.
In the west - and especially America - the notion that everyone can be a homeowner is prevalent. This, added to the widespread predatory lending following the immense asset bubble that was/is the housing market... you see where I'm going with this.
We can look back in history and see that it wasnt always this skewed in terms of values - people *did* rent a lot more. In and around the 19th and early 20th centuries, sometimes multiple families lived together until they had *saved* enough to head off alone. The problem we have with this concept today is that 1) peoples perceptions of private ownership are very different today, and they wish to have a lot more for themselves a lot quicker and; 2) for those who understand economics a little better, when asset and commodity index prices - in other words, the *real* rate of inflation - increase faster than the official rate of inflation, it makes no sense to save for too long in that currency. Indeed, it might be impossible anyway as the prices needed for everyday living with energy/food etc eat into any savings that might be a benefit someday. Then theres the whole de-regulation of the market, the added worry of a crash if one invests at the height of an asset bubble... and dont even get me started on the interest rates.
So you see, in a perfect world - yes, investing is better than renting by a long shot, but we're faced with a situation where the market in terms of prices is not a true reflection of reality. Until it settles down and capitalism reasserts itself, or we have a restructuring of the system or whatever, I believe *healthy* investment is just not going to happen - period.

Its not the idea of taxes that grind my gears; I'm more than happy to pay for peoples education and healhcare alongside civil services that we need in society (and would be greatly willing to provide this freely if taxes did become somehow voluntary). 
But the idea of *having* to pay money to a sprawling, overgrown bureaucratic machine that cares more for its own members than those that feed it, whilst spawning awful wars and destruction without democratic process from the people - and the threat of violence ever present if I didn't - well, no.

Thats the slower option, which could effectively take years for it to spread organically in a physical sense. People in this day and age dont want to spend that long doing stuff. 
I think its more likely that the black market (SR for example or an equivalent) would start selling bitcoins in the physical world, locally to the supply, for fiat. Professional launderers will know how to get rid of their fiat. The layperson by that stage will just want to get a hold of btc.

What I'm describing here [\(and it wasn't me that came up with this, just so you know\)]( is literally just a case of contracts between individuals based around their private property. This could be a person, a community, a company etc. Whenever there is a dispute over breach of contract then the case is settled in a private court.
We don't need force, violence or coercion to live in a peaceful society. A free society stands to gain much more in terms of prosperity than its statist neighbours. Indeed, it would be so prosperous, particularly as a trade partner, that its neighbours would even fight to defend it!

Definitely. Right now that capital created in the awful liquidity trap is sloshing around trying to find returns on investment. If it can't, which it won't, then it will enter stores of value before the market crashes. We've already doubled many of the western nations balance sheets since the crash, and India is the latest in what many believe will be an ever-increasing list of nations that join in beggaring-their-neighbour through QE. Equities are fucked, as are bonds, and september is upon us. Pass me the popcorn.

Humans have a tendency to organise themselves socially with the goal of order and cooperation in mind. What they won't tend to do is automatically form two classes; one which parasitises the other and holds a monopoly on violence and coercion, the other which simply agrees without a fight.

Personally, I never really understood what money was until bitcoin came along. Never saved, never thought about what I was doing.

Well, technically the artificial boom in prices *forced* prospective home owners to invest, thus providing the banks with a reason to inflate the economy.
