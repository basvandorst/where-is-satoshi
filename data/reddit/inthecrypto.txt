Sell your bitcoin for litecoin now and be glad you did when litecoin goes to $1000+ :)

I believe it.  US allies believe it. Every single US intelligence agency, comprised of thousands and thousands of hardworking data analysts and security professionals believe it.
It’s pretty much just Trump and dumb fucking boot lickers like yourself that don’t believe it.

Seems doubtful to me that the BTC community would be able to find consensus on implementing something like this.

And now litecoin devs will implement mimblewimble &amp; bulletproofs, stifling most privacy coins and relieving litecoin of the self inflicted "silver" pigeonholing.  The gold/silver analogy means nothing now.

my prediction is the opposite.  I think youre looking at the situation with rose colored glasses because you have some bitcoin.  Bitcoin forking again into 3 different currencies will only create confusion and hurt adoption.

I think Musk has said a few times now that he doesn’t own any crypto. Of course, there’s no way to know if that’s true - and he might not even know that he owns any lol

I should have realized the mods in here would be too stupid to see how the biggest names in this space being far right radicals is related to bitcoin.
Be careful what you idiots wish for. The more you have people running around talking about how great it is that Gab can collect bitcoin so Nazis can frolic on their network, the more you damage this scene.
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:02:33
Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:47:16
Fuck you, fuck gab and fuck anybody else trying to push this line of shit as a defense for it.  No.  lol
Gab is a platform that was made for and by radical right wing asshats who want to masquerade as "libertarians".
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:04:02
No it’s just me calling out a very toxic and pathetic section of this community because most of you numb nuts are too pussy to do so

Anybody that touts Gab accepting bitcoin and litecoin as a good thing and a good look for crypto is probably a far right Gab user.  I mean yeah it is a sign that its becoming easier for companies to accept crypto, but that is it.
A heads up for anyone, regardless of your political leanings: coopting and a social network used by actual fucking nazis who literally go and perpetuate mass murder or cheer it on, is not a good look.  
Yes, we have a wannabe-nazi in chief  for president right now and his admin probably wont crack down on bitcoin, but what about the next person to assume the office?  Don't give them any more reasons to do so.
Remove your heads from your asses.

Okeedokeee bro. The shooter in Pittsburgh and hundreds (maybe thousands?) of other people who identify as Nazis and with anti Semitic views and causes use gab every day.  Keep telling yourself that it’s purpose isn’t for exactly that. 
I don’t give a fuck if twitter or Facebook or stripe of any other services choose to ban them. Or if any bank or exchange decides to not accept their crypto to fiat exchanges.
Fuck them.
If they want to encourage the and proliferate the messages of hate groups, maybe they should get a little smarter and make a hidden service on the dark net like real low lives
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:11:02
Yeah and gab will never serve billions. Let alone 5 million. Lol.

No, you’re not. Szabo is a complete and utter piece of shit
