It's not hard. This rubbish comes from bcashers all the time, it's like they think internet is scarce. If you're in the middle of the ocean, you've got a problem. But generally in civilisation we have access to internet.

You mean like ones where 60% of hashrate is controlled by a single group?

But it's proven to help, as shown by the emptying of the mempool when coinbase (biggest non-segwit exchange) went down.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:50:23
Surely this particular FUD will affect bcash equally though.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:34:32
"supposedly" is the most important word in your question.
BTC is becoming a very attractive store of value, and has resisted many attacks, be it FUD, hard forks, Chinese regulation, or aggressively marketed copycat coins. Confidence has remained strong among investors through some very tough situations (which ultimately leads to stabler price) - alt coins have not been similarly tested.
So while you may want to speculate with a little bit of money here or there with alts, "just in case", it's more of a lottery ticket. Most investors would feel less at risk putting larger sums into BTC.

Have you ever zoomed in on older sections of the BTC graph? 
@_date: 2019-07-28 05:55:40
Absolutely.  
And when people are paid in fiat, and exchange it for food and toothpaste, they are paying the supermarket a premium to convert that fiat into the useable items they actually want. It's another middleman.  
So following this to it's logical conclusion, we should really only celebrate once we've returned to a barter economy of exchanging work for food and other things.  
See the issue?
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:41:37
Oh dear. You'll get there, it's just basic comprehension.
@_date: 2019-07-28 05:58:36
They don't even accept fiat. They accept the goods and services they actually want through a fiat-to-goods payment processor, at a significant markup (e.g. a supermarket).
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:48:17
Food is certainly a greater and more universal store of value. If some electromagnetic event occurs that takes the world offline, tins of beans will be worth far more than either bitcoins or dollars.
This is the point, there is no true store of value outside food. In China they put citizens to work on building empty cities for the future workforce to live in, as in theory building that infrastructure has stored the value; however, once the economy slows, and the unused buildings decay, that value decreases or becomes irrelevant.
Since the dawn of time it's been about food, and it will remain so until the last human - the rest is basically an illusion. The moment food gets scarce, all other value is meaningless. You can't say this about any other store of value.

It's equivalent to "hey, get online on Skype so that I can send you a file that's too big for e-mail". I do that kind of thing all the time. It's not a farfetched request for 2 parties to be online for a transfer.

That's because the bull run through 2017 was unprecedented. You would not change TA methods to accommodate it, as it is an extremely rare occurrence on any market.  
So by using TA methods that *do work*, aiming past those tops on BTC in 2017 would have been a straight up gamble, not a reasoned trade. Even if you won.

You didn't mention that. Tell me more about the guy and the things!

True. This is a sub for people who want to get rich without working for it. Not many actual traders here.

People on this sub don't understand TA.  
They also likely believe that card counters always lose at blackjack, because "the house always wins".

And as a maths-orientated guy, he will also know that with a flat universal income, there would be massive administrative savings for social security, given that nothing would need to be means-tested any more.
He will also know that trying to build yourself up from nothing is a thousand times harder than getting into work with the support of society.  
He will also know that working conditions will necessarily rise as people can't be bullied into zero-wage jobs.
It's a more efficient allocation of resources whichever way you look at it.

Bullish if true.

I have no idea, I didn't actually use it. They have electricity bills and mall real estate rent to pay, imaginably, so the exchange rate would always be far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  
I'm from the UK and have never seen one before, so I thought I'd just enjoy sharing the novelty of seeing one in the flesh!
@_date: 2018-06-30 09:04:56
Well, every trend change starts with a retracement I suppose. We can only talk in probabilities, and in those terms the TA should be right more often than it is wrong (even if not by much!)
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:27:38
You got it. Markets are made of people, and people are irrational.  
Even on major currency pairs, any "news" you're told has caused a move has been made up after the fact, to sound nice. At the moment the price moves, I can guarantee that the trader moving it is not considering that news, only ticks on a chart.

I had a friend who started buying at £13k in 2017, and his mum bullied him into buying all the way up to £18k. He since panic sold at £3k.  
This swings both ways.

It's a website about bitcoin.  
However, bitcoin is decentralised, has no owner or manager, and cannot endorse a person or website.  
It's an accurate website now, but if it isn't in future then it won't be. Nothing is trustworthy by default.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:07:13


I would suggest, as a forex trader, that buying something to sell it later for a higher price is a pretty sound investment. I suppose it depends what you're doing it for.

Sure, in the same way that I have the right to call my car a bitcoin, it doesn't make it true.
Logically speaking, the fork with the larger hashrate is bitcoin, and the other is not.
I guess the point is that whether or not the other sub was called btc originally, it does not seem to be about BTC. *Even if* I was of the disposition that bcash was the real bitcoin, r/btc is still the wrong sub, as I wouldn't consider btc to be bitcoin.
See what I'm saying?
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:25:13
But then people wouldn't buy it.

Ah that makes sense. Even so, that disagreement is what led to the creation of BCH, so there is some clear equivalence. In a chicken and egg kind of way.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:35:22
From what I gathered, people started pushing BCH as "the real bitcoin" on the Bitcoin sub, got banned for essentially trying to defraud people, and then made a sub called BTC which is ironically about BCH.
Like I say in there, if BCH is good enough to stand up on its' own merit, why try to obfuscate by using a BTC sub?

I've asked why it's not called r/bch a few times, and they never really have an answer other than "you clearly don't understand the history".
Got to shake your head. It's like having a sub about pounds sterling and calling it r/usd. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:23:12
Again, that's wonderful and all, but at the end of the day it's a community that is aggressively anti-btc, and they are based on a sub called r/btc. There's some serious cognitive dissonance going on over there.
