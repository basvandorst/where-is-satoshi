Yeah, which often takes 20-30 years for two people to pay off. It's still a substantial amount. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:28:10
I pretty much did the same. But I can't consciously buy into an alt that has zero utility other than to see gains anymore. 
That probably makes me a poor investor but I didn't get into crypto for that anyway. 
And remember that the BTC run over the past month has inflated every single alt so far.

Wealth, and the potential of increased wealth.

Their fiat holdings are covered to a point. I'm fairly sure their cryptocurrencies are not fully insured.
Useful information for many people though.

Easy, just download the Bitcoin Cash wallet and restore your original BTC wallet.
Make a backup of your existing wallet, then move your BTC to another wallet first as a precaution. After that you can import your backup into the Bitcoin Cash wallet.
Enjoy. Are you going to sell your BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:20:01
Yes, you still pay tax on the gains.

I've used a Ledger for a couple of weeks and it's a breeze. Great wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:06:50
This, however once fees become more acceptable, create a new wallet and send your funds there. Importing your private keys from an existing wallet defeats the purpose of the hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:34:53
Awesome collection, and best of luck with the venture.
The current rally has made everyone question just about everything they do other than buy BTC, but there's more life experience to be had in what you've done with an independent business than watching the charts all day.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:38:23
Move your BTC to a new wallet, preferably on a PC. Wait for confirmations. Install Electron Cash and import your pre-August keys. Send your BCash to an exchange and sell for BTC.
Edit: Run a backup of your app and export, then follow this tutorial (read under protobuf wallet format):

It's about time the general mood here picked up.

I don't think we're equating andreas success purely with wealth here.

You wouldn't download a car.

Thanks. What's the worst case scenario if the first transaction of BTC fails and you then send the BCH? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:26:41
The analogy is the same of converting fiat to bitcoin. You would need an intermediatry.

I used them recently for a bit of xrp and it went through, but something seems really off about that exchange in general. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:10:44
Sold 75% of my BCH last night on the pump about 8pm, I absolutely did not think Coinbase would ever open BCH buys. How wrong I was. I'll review this evening and see if I made the right decision.

Provided you create a brand new seed, I don't think you have anything to worry about. 
If the seller attempted to modify the firmware, Ledger claim that you'd be alerted to it: 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:16:38
It works when you can both buy/sell with Bitcoin. At this point, if you use an exchange then they are going to share your details anyway.

As far as I know there's no simple implementation for BitPay with squarespace. However if you want to stick with a hosted solution then you could look into Shopify etc.
There's a full list of integrations here:
I feel though the bigger question is whether your customers are likely to actively use bitcoin for purchases? Personally I'd recommend moving over to Stripe and also accepting btc for the best of both worlds. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:53:45
BitPay hasn't delivered the way I imagined it would back in 2013. In the UK at least, they've stood still since 2015 for merchant uptake.

What cabs do you have op? I bought a blast city a couple years back and got into the whole retro arcade thing for a while. Aside from the huge amount of space needed for a good collection, it's fun, tons of holy grail cabs out there to find and some very knowledgeable people.

It's a particularly festive year.

There has been development on decentralised P2P exchanges for cryptocurrencies, but unfortunately converting to fiat will require a centralised service for the foreseeable future unless you're fine trading directly with individuals. 
The goal has always been to not need to convert back to fiat to use profit from bitcoin, and despite the past few months it's something that will continue to improve over time, and widespread adoption will help that. Still, it's a shame that ecommerce adoption hasn't really improved in the past couple of years. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:08
It will be delicious.

This might not be the current consensus, and no doubt there is a lot of money to be made, but I'm done with alts for now. Most offer no new solutions, many have tacked on a token to a product that doesn't otherwise need it, and the hysteria about what will be the next coin to go big on Coinbase is getting really stupid. I'm discounting Eth for this because it's served a good purpose to minimise fees and a few spin off projects have actually begun to demonstrate some utility for it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:54:34
Possibly find another exchange if you're in a hurry. They've coped fairly well with the surge considering it's Coinbase, but the service is patchy at best and they will likely take a while to respond. I've had a couple of transactions put into pending for 72 hours for no reason recently, which I haven't had otherwise in 3 years.

Go GDAX to Ledger and they'll eat the fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:02:11
It's been ages since I've used multibit so I can't remember the layout but it's the txid for the transaction. Multibit will have set a ridiculously (relative to current events) low fee that may never get confirmed. There are a few ways to push it through, were you using multibit classic or HD?

At 900 you'd currently be looking at 10-360 minutes.

Unless you want to put everything on black, don't take the risk. Holding has been a successful enough strategy so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:17:28
Because the keys were stored in a place where there is the potential for them to be compromised (even if it is unlikely with blockchain.info). 
You have to ask yourself whether you trust blockchain.info as much as a hardware wallet.

No need for guilt if you're hodling. You know you're going to profit in the long run.

Don't forget that in the UK if you opt out of their TV services you'll essentially be harassed in your own home by 'enforcement officers' until you buy a licence or let them in to look around your property (and then receive threatening letters ad nauseum). 
BBC is beyond a joke and I hope I see it fall one day.
