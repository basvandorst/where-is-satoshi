nifty. it's a good start. Bitrated has a system worth copying more me thinks. the LBC system was always crippled, why would they leave it anon like that and encourage scamming? I never got that and with everyone begging them to change it... 
awesome there is some real completion now to level out the playing field.
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:14:56
Race conditions are something everyone should look into as I've seen this happen over and over. It is the web app layer "double spend" , sums it up pretty well.

try making a buy offer on paxful.com and localbitcoins
Some dude from Australia sold me some btc on pax after an hour after i put up my buy offer, I am in the us.
First dude i chatted with was from korea on pax so he may see your offer.
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:34:54
1st step dive into the space as a "commoner"
Best way to do this is to begin trading, that way you see all the common problems people are having. it can lead you to an awesome idea or people.
just make an account on paxful localbitcoins bitwallet
These 3 sites let you buy and sell bitcoin with ordinary folks.
@_date: 2015-05-20 16:07:54
yup! needs to be an open and free market. this is core
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:32:44

@_date: 2015-05-16 21:08:27

@_date: 2015-08-22 16:25:48

@_date: 2015-08-11 00:05:03
Dudes will go far. 
Cuz I'm They give a damn.
@_date: 2015-08-28 23:58:26
did you even try it? it passes a token to their wallet and auto sends out. alot more than a link.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:10:55
Really like this article. Very good point.. How can any startup ok any new feature??
@_date: 2015-08-22 00:03:13
wild troll on the loose has hardon for paxful
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:58:33
check out paxful too. less scammers.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:29:02
love your note books bro!!!
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:28:51
yup, just read bout it.
Seems bp is using the visa processor of their Dutch parent company. some wild stories in that article. apparently it was like a zoo for them doing all those calls.
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:01:23
i got scammed twice on local bitcoins like this. they don't care as long as they get the fees...
beware anyone with bank of America.. cash deposits can be reversed the same biz day if they present the receipt!!!
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:17:30
biggest story going on now and all i see is jokes about escorts.
these guys need to put out a video. pref with big booty girls. 
go pax!
@_date: 2015-08-29 15:33:20
try paxful.com or localbitcoins.com
paxful has a few prepaid debit dealers. not always online tho but the bitcoin is available instantly when u do the trade.
@_date: 2015-07-10 22:10:02
did five sales for over $100 for a few of them. $5 ain't worth it for me for bank deposit. glad someone is walking them through it tho. Must be maddening after a while with total newbies?
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:48:25
Skip the slides and GIVE 5 people a bucks worth of bitcoin right away
most important thing is to GET them some bitcoin asap even a dollars worth so they can use it and SEE. 
the wallet doesn't matter but bread wallet, pheva and airbitz are the simplest.
Tell them to hit up some of the paypal sellers on paxful and buy some bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:56:13
she pronounces escrow kinda funny but she is hot and i like it! rock on paxful!
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:23:16
these guys just launched a few weeks ago. i got an invite from a friend. they actually listen to us, which is cool.
@_date: 2015-08-17 22:14:19
that wording there is insane. this is all the proof you need.
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:41:18
Same troll from before. Nuthin better to fo huh?
@_date: 2015-08-22 00:02:47
get a life dude
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:34:56
there are tons of ladies on paxful like that. they don't seem to care. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:24:43
wow... so you guys have been handling alot of ladies of night eh? you just noticed like that when they stopped coming? interesting points by Sarah, I think more and more smaller cliques will join the bitcoin economy slowly. we need to be ready for them.
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:08:02
awesome write up.
May wanna add paxful.com ( i sell bitcoin there) a peer to peer site )
and gocelery.com another site like circle or coinbase but which i use more.
paxful gives 1 on one support and you can find selelrs who don't ask for id and take gift cards etc.. best way to buy.
celery gives the best rates but u gotta link a bank account and give id.
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:14:48
do not feed the Buttcoin trolls!
lots of people feared this day, when bitcoin really gets out to the public. just keep truckin.. and sendin me folks to help ;)
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:46:00
Yup, they asked for experienced ones only all caps etc.
Dont feed the trolls.
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:12:19
don't forget pax they are the shiny new deal. they actually implemented a suggestion I gave them in their whatsapp pro trader group. bout time LBC had some competition! hoping for a fee price war :)
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:03:01
nice guide, but change  to tell them about the sellers fee.
So people know that we make a profit off each sale. so if they pay $50 they get like $45 in bitcoin or whatever.
the more people that see this the better. I have like 20 repeat buyers already!
@_date: 2015-07-25 03:43:19
yeah, noticed this. u got slammed pretty damn hard to zero. whats up? any idea whose comin down on you?
@_date: 2015-07-23 20:40:06
nice stats for a new site in beta and all but nothing compared to any established exchange. 
Still this is amazing, you guys are taking charge in the biggest thing to happen to bitcoin in a long while, maybe ever I agree. This bp thing is HUGE for bitcoin. props!
would tip u but i lost my changetip email :/
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:55:01
nice. a good place to buy and sell is paxful.
alot more user friendly than local bitcoins and less scams.
check out my offers. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 00:05:01
coinbase is instant once u verify your credit card. etc..
alot of folks have debit. also turning on instant takes a few days. so for first time buyers it is never instant. u ever try it?
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:31:34
Add 
they are already helping those folks out.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:57:39
this works!
i buy with liberty x and resell on paxful now. works like a charm!!!
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:50:52
you guys need to put out some videos proving your call story. of course i beleive you because i got a ton of trades from total newbies on paxful and had to walk them thru the simplest stuff but yeah. shut the haters up!
go go paxful
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:16:59
try getting a giftcard and swapping it for btc from tolan77
He helps alot of folks and doesn't need id.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:42:27
looks like they hired someone to design the site who wasn't blind for one. a step in the right direction. basically the same service tho, they gotta a ways to go before they are something "different" still don't need to be that different to be something new, just one thing is enough usually. all bout how they take care of their customers. my 2 cents
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:39:00
They think that a p2p tech like btc and p2p stuff like open bazaar goes well together with p2p markets to give people coins instead of centralized sources. according to the 1st paragraph anyways. heh.
they have a good lil marketplace going, lbc needs some competition badly. i think they are getting them to move their ass.
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:59:26
these guys got plenty of big traders doing big deals on there. I brought over a few of my steadies. I think they need traders to do small amts now and customer support, not my bag, but good luck to em. someone has to help these backpagers.
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:48:25
how much is it to brigade?
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:17:22
liberty x works! gets my vote! and FAST
@_date: 2015-08-06 00:23:34
always thought bitcoin could help farmers immensely.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:49:02
will be watching bitsquare.io 
curious as to when we can give it a shot? 1 month? 6 months?
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:00:05
scams on LBC are almost always from the buyer. i got scammed there a few times and then my rep got destroyed by the scammer neg anon feedback.. ugh.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:28:41
Got two of these Baron Figs... best damn notebooks. betetr than moleskin.
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:36:54
This is a job in and of itself. They need to control the ways users come in without throttling the flow of real buyers. This is a huge huge job. These guys seem great at product and marketing and they seem to care alot but not sure a small 2 man team can do this now....
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:19:56
check out my paypal offer here 
I get alot of trades there and release fast, 10 minutes or less.
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:26:09
yeah, u need bigger quality jpegs... seriously tho. lots of people will see this so make it quality, still awesome work tho!
mad props to PAXFUL!
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:00:03
rock on! hire some support staff and take some videos this time. Lets doc history.
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:33:48
I'm in the early progra, got 2 ppmc offers going and done a few trades. pretty slick, like the messaging. should open up full on private messaging too.
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:45:47
hmm... sounds like stackoverflow's tag system. if so very smart. we need some real innovation here and a team who still stay ontop of stuff and give the power traders the stuff we want. just make sure your hot wallet is locked down or it could all go up in smoke.
really lookin' forward to this. site looks good!
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:20:14
very awesome video.
I joined the paxful site. they let me join their invite only peer to peer market beta. like local bitcoins but bette rui to help folks buy bitcoins instantly. good to see developers also showing the more human side of bitcoin. mad props to andrew. will make a fat donation once i do another pp mc trade eheheh
@_date: 2015-09-19 14:44:46
this is a huge red flag.... makes me think all kinds of tin foil hat stuff....
@_date: 2015-09-19 14:43:38
check out paxful.com and localbitcoins.com
Paxful is more user friendly but localbitcoins has more sellers.
Had good experiences on both. Paxful support seems geared especially for newbies check out their back page effect video. bonus, paxful has debit card sellers, did not try them but curious as to how the sellers avoid being scammed.
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:11:34
I process alot of One Vanilla cards on paxful.
Localbitcoins and paxful are the only places to buy btc with prepaid debit. Scammers do try and peep in but I've gotten pretty good at sniffin em out.
@_date: 2015-10-13 06:49:03
I sell BTC for onevanilla prepaid debit cards. I give like 0.72 on the dollar.
You can get rates around there
