Likewise. I'm in the United Kingdom. Why don't Circle want me to use their app? They let me use their website. Frustratingly stupid.

Don't forget that the donor pays the transaction fee, not the recipient. So the Foundation should only worry about the processing costs. I suspect also that Coinbase/Bitpay/etc will be keen to offer very reasonable rates indeed to bring someone like Wikipedia onboard.

It'll be interesting to hear the details about their free insurance. To be able to import my bitcoin and keep it there in a "hot" wallet ready for instant access, but know it's insured, would be pretty cool.

"No real reason"? You gave your resources to a noble project.

They were probably the second largest computer company in the world through the seventies. They made Multics, the predecessor of Unix.

Indeed. Yet strangely, the platform then lets me place a buy order significantly in excess of that CAD1000!. :)

The answer is simple: VAT (sales tax). They're "selling" a virtual good, not trading currency, in the eyes of HMRC and thus are subject to 20% tax once the business turns over more than the VAT threshold (which is approx £75000). This is totally uncompetitive with other exchanges!

How did they get your email address? I'd assume that they have a bitcoin related list from a hacked site...

Their API seems to still be up and serving ticker information - [here's an example]( So it seems that their core engine is still OK. Worrying though.

I must admit I knew it was 95% a scam. But didn't have quite enough time to check for sure. In hindsight...

I thought blockchain pulled BTC purchasing because they were required to pay VAT? Did they discuss this anywhere? 
They had a great service, I bought £500 worth so easily...

Chrome bookmarks for a man with a 5 day old baby probably shouldn't include "free porn" ;-)

Have bought twice via bank transfer and BTC arrived both times within 30 mins. You're probably just unlucky but I don't know what the next steps are....

Back to reality, with a bump. This is healthier in the long term - and let's hope it stays stable now.

"£22.69 shipping via FedEx" doesn't sound free to me. UK definitely not included!

A fair point. It's common due to crypt, but this is a legacy approach taken for the clock speeds of decades ago - and therefore provides weaker security.

A maximum character limit for passwords probably means they aren't hashing them (pardon the pun). This means they are probably extreme amateurs.

This used to be correct but is not true today. Gmail implemented total SSL for a 1% increase in the total CPU load. 
...the more you know :-)

Surely VAT is a big issue too? Blockchain was selling a digital service, not exchanging money, from the HMRC point of view. So they should have been paying 20% VAT on "sales".
Not saying it's right, but that would be my worry...
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:35:35
HMRC doesn't see Bitcoin as a currency. Therefore UK exchanges are just selling a good, and must pay VAT on Bitcoin "sales". Hence there are no good UK exchanges. Sad but that's how it is right now.

What answer did they give?

Wait until august and you'll be bust... I got nothing...

They say they've shipped: 
I guess they could be buying time - but in a few more days we'll see if anyone receives one.
