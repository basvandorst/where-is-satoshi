I disagree.. it's a simple argument.. more blocks can sustain more pools. I don't really think anyone can dispute this (although clearly noone wants to admit one of the parameters chosen by satoshi might have been less than optimal). P2pool could fix bitcoin by eliminating pools but so far it seems to have gained little traction.

so maybe dogecoin is the solution with even more blocks :p I don't really disagree with your points, however even delaying the problem seems like a good idea.. if bitcoin can sustain say 2 or 3 large top tier pools, having 4x as many - say 4-12 instead seems like at least a small step in the right direction.

Probably because it would be dangerous if bitcoin were actually decentralized.. it would be impossible to make any changes anymore because of too many zombies who never upgrade.

uk bank transfers are (usually) instant and free.. there are other 3rd party transfer companies (some people use pingit or neteller or even paypal) but they only work if both parties have them.. everyone has bank transfers but if you want some other payment method you're limiting who you can deal with. Also none of that really protects you from receiving funds from hacked accounts.. even with e-transfers they are reversible in the case of fraud.

The pools have almost no chance of being found out if they did something.. also they're run by people who could easily be kidnapped and tortured or perhaps bribed or blackmailed; so even if they are entirely altruistic there's really no way you can trust them.
P2pool is essentially solo-mining where people send each other proof that they included a payout to someone in return for reciprocity. There's no one entity in control of the payouts.. each miner can decide who to include or exclude and (perhaps more importantly) what other (non-coinbase) transactions to include or exclude. It's just solo mining where everyone puts everyone else's payout into the coinbase of their solo mined blocks.. they also send each other the blocks they find at a lower than necessary difficulty as proof that they are including each other's payment addresses. Then when someone actually finds one with a good enough difficulty then everyone they included gets paid.

If you can justify 'No it doesn't' I'd be interested in hearing it.. but I doubt that you can. More blocks can sustain more top tier pools. I take your point about sub-leasing, but such slave pools have almost no independence being reliant as they are on their masters to assign their work. Sure they could switch to one of the other 2 or 3 top tier pools, but firstly that isn't much choice and secondly it's probably not possible for them to determine whether they should switch or not.. if one of the top tier pools processes a doublespend they will surely release it through tor or another IP so that noone can tell it was them.. the slave pools could only catch that if they are paying very close attention to the work they are assigned which I very much doubt they would do - there's no particular profit motive in it for them and it would be a lot of work.

I think it's a reasonable explanation.. maybe it's not reasonable as a reason to not build p2pool into bitcoind, but plenty of things aren't reasonable.

this nicely demonstrates one advantage of litecoin - more blocks can sustain more pools.

I agree that having too many blocks could cause problems as well.. I think it can be safely increased over where it is in bitcoin as has been shown by other altcoins.
I also agree that 4x as many blocks might not lead to 4x as many pools.. but it would probably allow for some more.. 144blocks/day could sustain 25 pools if they were evenly distributed but as you know that's not what happens. Unless p2pool gets rolled out bticoin will probably always be dominated by 2 or 3 pools.. which makes a joke out of the whole 'distributed' concept really - and what's the point of burning all that electricity if it just hands the power to two or three individuals anyway?
@_date: 2014-01-01 20:33:12
Indeed.. I wonder if many people do that with the existing pools? Presumably it would be easy to mine on all pools simultaneously and collect payouts from each of them?
