Well it shows that a decentralized coin with a random group of devs for an open source problem has the same problems like Linux had once and has today.
It's hard to say but it seems like strict controlled coins will win the race. Centralized solutions like Ripple and kinda Stellar too. Ethereum DAO-Hacked and chain reversed. People and shills have to learn the hard way.

i totally agree with that market share stuff. Most people don't see that. Even my friends doing crypto now for 1 year still don't understand what I am talking about when I try to explain it to them

Why people who run a full node don't receive any incentive like miners get with the tx fee? That would be something very useful.

and what if you are wrong? You really think that BTC is forever unbeatable?
MySpace also thought so ;) But serious, there are already very good techs outside. IOTA, Pascal and Monero for example.
But I agree partly that most coins are just a cheap copy with a big media mashine in the back making only the devs rich.

This flip flop behavior will end up in just more losses. I dont understand why ppl. never follow AT LEAST the basic rules in trading:
Make a plan!
When to buy. What you expect. What to do if the not expected happens.
Very easy.
Trading is nothing bad. I increased my BTC Portfolio about 10x with altcoin trading. I'll never understand that ppl. dont understand that they NEVER hit the bottom and top of a currency. Why ppl. cannot be just patient and expect to get rich from yesterday to tomorrow?
Oh dear..

Who are you?
Who has control of the wallet?
Why not just donating it.
Why collecting more bitcoins? Why not motivate others to just donate, why it should go thorugh your wallet?
The page is anonym, you are anonym. "You" could be just a pump group attracting people by putting a huge amount of Bitcoins into an account, make a nice page, play the good guy and just go on with more bitcoin in the end. Would not be the first time.
Sorry, for me it looks like a smart scam.
Downvotes make me confident it's a scam by a group.

@_date: 2017-12-03 17:46:06
Actually not. 
ETH is more a contract plattform than a currency. The fanboys and investors say it's both (ofc they say everything in hope that the price spikes ;))
So if my company wants to use the blockchain to keep contracts cheap connected I can migrate the Database to the blockchain. No need here for the public ETH chain.
But if my company wants to offer customers a payment solution based on blockchain they can either go for an own blockchain (which lacks of adoption) or they can just integrate bitcoin and participate at the whole network effect of BTC.

Show us one real contract made by AXA in the public chain. There is none. AXA is working on the testnet to make use of the tech. But they'll not use the public chain by the reason I mentioned above. No CTO will ever make their business dependend on an expensive tech when they can host it inhouse for free.

One user claimed it has been spent 86 millions. It's wrong, right?
I saw that some money went somewhere. 2 Million in BTC are like 125 BTC...easy to gather around the community by acting like its a charity which people can join.

it was not the bug, it was the NO GO, that Vitalik and the miners just "resetted" the blockchain after the DAO Hack. Imagine you are an insurance company, running plenty of contracts in the public chain and some idiots come accross and just reset the blockchain and everything is lost.
Thats why every company, really every, in the EEA said, they'll never use the public chain. Beside the hack it's just cheaper to create an own blockchain based on the code of ETH which is public. Why buy one ETH for x $ when companies can just create their own one. But ofc the little investor in ETH doesn't want to hear that

@_date: 2017-12-14 04:31:41
what claims and why?
I am very sceptical about the reasons I gave. They say it's a legit charity. In the US and also Europe a charity has to be registered and is not allowed to by anonym exactly because of that reasons that money can just "disappear"
That 2 million were sent doesn't convince me that this project is legit. Its only 125 BTC which is fast re-collected by advertise how good it is to join a charity project, like it is done here.
Still, why announce it that big? Why not just donating? Too many questions I can bring in that direction which makes it looking fishy. That shouldn't be like this.

If BTC goes up I still have 50%. I bought at 300$ and increased my deposit with altcoin trading. No matter in which direction BTC goes, I am happy with what I have :) No matter how high BTC will go.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:37:31
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:42:10
I agree. But BTC as a currency is atm not ideal. I found 2 yesterday morning, transfered them with a fee of 5$ and they are still unconfirmed. BTC has a scalabilty problem at the moment. Its sometimes too slow and too expensive. In Europe for example I can transfer for 0€ in between 1-24 hours. Was in Thailand recently and could even withdraw/exchange for free EUR/Baht. So for me it's atm cheaper and more comfortable to just use Euro. (Despite I am totally for crypto and against GOV printing money) 
So I see BTC more as a very good store of value even when prices a highly volatile.

I also sold 50% of my coins few hours ago. I have my own thoughts about that, but I don't want to share them. Why? because BTC and the community made it possible that today I am a very wealthy man. I want to give other people also the chance to make profits like I did. So no FUD. 
p.s. if BTC comes back to 5k, I'll buy back xD

He is talking about Bitcoin as money. But I dont know, I recently paid minimum fee for a transaction and it was 1,80$
In Europe money transfer is free. So in that matter Bitcoin is not a competitor. For me Bitcoin is more close to a store of value instead. Unfortuneately.

I have a trading volume &gt; 500.000 but i only trade with less than 40.000 ... like 20 times sell and buy with 40k makes 500k. Moreover I trade since the middle of 2016...i still have more than 3 years to make by tax declaration so it cannot be a penalty due to taxes? And why should they come with the police.

ah cmon. r/btc is influenced and under control of the Ethereum marketing mafia. 80% of the posts there are against Bitcoin (any future of it) and pro Ethereum. That sub is only to make noobs buying Ethereum and push its price. And its Ethereum only. What you guys think? Its a MULTI BILLION Dollar market. And unregulated. Hire some cheap people, make them writing pro Ethereum 24/7 and imply that Ethereum is the one and only. And all "legally". Crypto is already a marketing war zone.

Its a funny thing. As soon as you have enough money and actually the freedom to do what you want, you (sometimes) recognize that you are already doing what you want :)
I like my work, I like my regular day. It just makes things easier. If my work would stress me, i would just quit and look for another one. But i really dont feel the need to buy things and show "i made it"...maybe it is because I am a girl (no man bashing) 
I feel happy do have my little flat, my dog, my friends and that I am healthy. It is just a nice feeling to have a big buffer for "bad times" :) I also thought about buying a house...but it is to much work for me and I dont want to have other people in my house cleaning it :D

Wie will man das denn nachweisen? Das ist ja nicht wie bei Aktien mit festen Wertpapiernummern. Ich habe bisher immer BTC auf bitcoin.de gekauft, diese dann alle an Polo gesendet und auch dort vermehrt :) 
Dann ab und an wieder coins von Polo and bitcoin.de zurück. Das ich mal mit mehr als 12500 gehandelt habe kam die letzten 4 jahre vielleicht 4-5x vor...sonst viele kleine Trades wenn BTC mal wieder crashte. Ich mein ich habe ja keine 100.000 Euro oder so, bei weitem nicht. Wenn ich 2x für 12.500 kaufe und 2x für 12.5000 verkaufe, habe ich ja keine 50.000EUR. Aber genau so haben die Experten hier vorhin mit ihren Listen rumgefuchtelt. Die haben einfach das komplette Volumen genommen. So nach dem Motto "Sie haben 1x mehr als 12.500 gehandelt, deshalb haben wir das Recht alle Transaktionen zu bewerten" Naja, werde die Woche ein Termin beim Anwalt machen!

This is actually not an issue, at least not for me. I trade with an app and these strong volatilities is what gave me huge profits.
I think people have to accept that crypto is not stock market. Its something new and people should not be afraid of 80% losses. 
Because you can also win 80% in one day (not with BTC but with some alts for example)
It seem to be unfair that the rich could be in control of the coins but dont forget, also the rich fight against each other. It is just about being smart in that period and go with the flow :)
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:08:39

The demand of BTC will be so much bigger in the future. So if i can live my life in 10 years with only 1 bitcoin, why the hell should i sell any of it today? I have enough money already to have a healthy life. So what. Ok buy your lambo but in 10 years youÄll be poor again. And your lambo is worth a shit ;)

" not developed enough "  
I would say "too young" instead. How many currencies crashed in the last 500 years? A lot. Many of them are gone. The paper was not worth it. But Bitcoin is, like gold, something different. I think, when its not Bitcoin itself, the tech will 100% stay. And personally I am also convinced Bitcoin will stay.

r/btc is a fake sub mostly in hands of an ETH Mafia. I chose this word intended and I mean it like this. Crypto is a multi billion dollar market and they are organized groups who pump and push their currency. Be careful.
