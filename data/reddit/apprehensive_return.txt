I haven't bought any bitcoins since 2015 and I'm seriously considering buying more at this point. My most expensive coins were under $600 but now I'm thinking $6000 is a damn good deal.

This guy is also wrong more often than he's right. The only reason people pay attention to him is because he's a billionaire who made a very lucky bet on Ethereum a couple of years ago and turned a $500k investment into a couple hundred million. As far as I know, he hasn't made any successful trades since then. He makes a lot of outrageous predictions that never come true though!

Wow, that's a recipe for disaster. Make sure you check EVERY character in the address after pasting. Not just the first few and last few characters.
There is malware out there that will make an address that looks very similar to the one you copied and tons of people have made the mistake of not checking every character and losing some money.
So yes it can go very very wrong.

Huh? What's that matter?
The US population is very well armed but there are still tons of robberies and home invasions. Sometimes the robbers get shot. People still get robbed.
How could you think that guns are a deterrent to robberies if they still happen all the time anyway?

And people still upvote it like crazy. That tells you a lot about the bitcoin market.

What a dumb tautology. Just because it has value to you doesn't mean it has value to anyone else. And if it doesn't have value to anyone else then how can you possibly value it?

No that is the original meaning of "tube steak"
