1dollar = 1 coffee. 1 BTC needs to be 10.000.000 Dollars for a coffee to be 10 satoshi's. A more realistic number would be 1 BTC= 200.000 in 2025, that would make 1 coffee of 1 dollar 500 satoshi's (gas excluded)

You are one of the reasons bitcoin is not growing to its full potential. If you like bitcoin and would like to make it grow faster you should use it more often. If the stores you use bitcoin at see an increase in use it will only give us a better name. If you and everyone just decides to hold it nothing will ever happen. And bitcoin is meant as a currency not sure why you would say its primary use is as a store of value?
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:43:27
Deposit a small amount of BTC to it and then go on the BTC adres and sent the BTC back with the private key. If it works you know the private key is legit.

It will probably go like this.
CIA/FBI/White house: From our extensive researched we where able to follow the money from ISIS go to .... then to this country and then to Bitcoin and that is where it got lost. These terrorists shouldn't be able to launder there money this way and we should do something about it right now! And then you have the uneducated people agreeing with it and you will start getting called a ISIS funder by your friends and family that don't understand bitcoin. But this will all end when enough people that do get it start investing in Bitcoin so it become's too big to fail.

I don't agree with you at all, especially not the last point you made.
''What Bitcoin is trying to achieve is not something you can simply teach, you need the person to understand how everything works, otherwise it's useless.''
No one can fully understand how something works, that is why you have to teach and learn. Otherwise schools would be useless and teachers would say, science is too hard and I won't teach it because you can't fully understand. This is completely false and kids have an easier time learning then adults. Teaching your kid how bitcoin works at a young age can't hurt him, it's not like ha has a 200MB brain that can't handle it.

Actually none if you send money through bank wire/SEPA and then transfer your money from coinbase to their exchange GDAX and then place a buy order there. So if you send over 1000$ you will be able to buy 1000$ of BTC without fees.
If you buy directly on coinbase you do have to pay fees. 
I know it sounds a bit complicated but it is not, I suggest watching a youtube video on it and sending the money from coinbase to gdax is instant and it will save you some money, especially if you are going to buy more BTC in the future.

Because you got a lot of rich people that don't understand the blockchain and would love to approach a bank and have them buy it for them (kind of like a hedgefund) but easier.

30.000 in a hot wallet for Binance is normal, as they have lot's of people on their platform. And you don't know the system so who knows why it works and how it's not hacked yet.

Don't try and argue with a moron that got into this sub just to argue with idiotic statements. If someone really thinks the government will somehow use a kill switch to turn off the internet just to be able to stop bitcoin he is retarded and doesn't understand that the internet is needed at 99% of the company's in the world and almost all communication is done through them. 
What would happen if you would kill the internet in 2017?
1. No one would have acces to his money that is saved in the bank
2. Bankers would need to do everything manually and everything would take a couple of days or weeks to avoid someone withdrawing money at 2 banks he doesn't really have.
3. Most if not all companies would collapse
4. Chaos because almost every human being in the world needs the internet as a form of communication
5. You really think the police and military would defend some people that are trying to destroy the country when almost 100% of the world is suffering? including the family members of the policeman and woman.
There are a thousand more things that would happen within the first day and it would probably be up and running within 2 days if it did happen.
But someone that can't even think 1 step ahead is too stupid to think 1000.

Would you like to explain why there is no way to ban exchanges?
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:29:21
1 - Multisig doesn't work for hot wallets especially not for hot wallets on an exchange that has 50.000 BTC volume daily for only BTC pairs.
2 - Biggest exchange based on users signed up and approved and volume in the last month (excluding today, because of the server update)
3 - You are certain they don't, well aren't you the smart boy here, why don't you go ahead and breach their unsafe system or why hasn't anyone else done it this far?
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:36:21
Because bitcoin can't do what Ethereum is doing right now. And there are many other alt coins that have their own real world usage. Bitcoin is just bitcoin, crypto gold as some call it. If bitcoin somehow develops to be able to do everything every other alt does then indeed there is no reason for alt coins to exist.
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:35:26

Teaching your kids about bitcoin without teaching them first some fundamental steps about economics and the internet is indeed a big leap. But crypto is going mainstream and it can't hurt if you teach your kid about it and give them an edge over others when it comes to this topic.

They can't because the Ledger generates a new wallet and private key that have never been used before. If someone where to make a fake ledger they could have the inside be something simple with preloaded adreses where the hackers know the private keys off, but this would not work as the ledger would not communicate with the App.

Multisignature (multisig) refers to requiring more than one key to authorize a Bitcoin transaction. It is generally used to divide up responsibility for possession of bitcoins.
Even if they had multisig you still wouldn't know. And multisig it meant for cold wallets and for corporations to hold their coins not for hot wallets that send coins every second of the day.
And this is one source claiming that it's the largest, many more to be found online. 
And you say why don't any other exchanges use it? Well look at Bittrex and their hot wallet containing 1.5 billion in USD worth of alt coins.
There are many exchanges that have done this for years and of course everything can be breached, but they are not stupid and if they where stupid they wouldn't have made it this far.
