how about building mobile apps faster because you are reusing components on a huge toolbox instead of starting from scratch?
btw, are you a dev?

They are going to be distributed by mining and in software development bounties. As for now only in bounties, mining has not started yet.

Have you read the white paper? What are your thoughts on it?

have tried submitting a PR with a fix? it is open source

I wouldn't say bye bye to everyone, but a healthy p2p alternative is always good, specially if it reduces the cost for end users of the system in transactions that otherwise have a middleman.

Did anyone here read the white paper? it is here:

where does it say that is gets micro-payments on all transactions? "Each level is then translated into the amount of fermats a component collects per month as micro-­use licenses." . It looks like a software license at a component level to me.

In the future predictions,  one thing haven't been taken into account: innovation. There are still a lot of clever minds that haven't stepped in yet with their new ideas and concepts,  and from those new concepts the adoption, and the way it occurs, could change radically at any moment. Predicting the future of bitcoin adoption based only in what is available now is not realistic in my opinion.

As far as I know,  when you submit the doc to proof of existence,  you are not sending the doc but a hash of it. In that way,  nobody knows which evidence you have.

Is this the setup you would recommend if you were to hold A LOT of bitcoins? How would you improve it for such a case?

Where the exploits removed from the open source OS after the revelations?

Very interesting. In practice how did you do this? with a software? which one?

Fermat is a framework for developing mobile apps out of reusable components. The system automatically collects monthly micro-payments to components developers. It also has a p2p network for interconnecting end user devices. This enables to run mobile p2p apps without going through web servers infrastructure. What Gaby is building is a general purpose mobile p2p taxi platform that later can be niched very easily by anyone, since the reusable components are already there. You will be able to replace the GUI and have your own p2p "uber" like app for your own city with very little amount of work, and the system will still honor original component authors with their monthly micro-payments. Today if you build open source and someone forks you, you get nothing, even if the whole world uses that fork. Fermat helps monetize open source in a fair way.

Is this the first bitcoin APP to charge a fee in BTC? How did the others did?
