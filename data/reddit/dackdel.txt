right. ok. I ment this “I’m worried about it and there’s a big debate in the Bitcoin community about how are we going to do this,” says Andresen. His favored solution is to increase the size of the “blocks” of transactions that get confirmed by the network of bitcoin miners every 10 minutes. If that doesn’t happen, then getting a transaction processed promptly will require paying a significant transaction fee to promote it ahead of others, he says. Not everyone agrees with Andresen’s proposed fix. Some opponents argue it would make Bitcoin more centralized. Larger blocks would make mining the currency so computationally intensive that only major corporations could do it, they say, giving them a kind of centralized power over the currency’s use. Andresen underlines his own position using the Bitcoin version of scripture. “If you read Satoshi’s writings, it’s obvious he intended it as a day-to-day transaction network for everybody,” he says.
and the para before and after this one.

@_date: 2015-05-14 05:04:25
hmm. what about etherium or something similar. someone somewhere must be working on a fix for this? 
@_date: 2015-05-21 08:23:04
have you or do you know someone who has recreated factom using the source code?
@_date: 2015-05-12 05:57:30
something like this then  this isnt currency but is a different use of the blockchain to validate documents. 
I was refering to the whole article but in the last paragraph he talking about expanding bitcoin to increase transaction per second.

Could I ask what is your day job? What about countries like Iceland adopting the digital currency and Estonia offering e-residency. I agree and ive sort of lost the idea that bitcoin could be that currency but I still believe that the blockchain could work if it is pays back the people who are spending electricity/internet to keep it running. Will etherium work?
