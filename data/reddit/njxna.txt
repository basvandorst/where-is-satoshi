Buy a crystal ball. Use it. Cry when it goes up 5% the moment you sell

If you use the combo SEPA transfer + GDAX for exchange on limit order + Hardware wallet transfer it comes with pretty much 0 fees from purchase to your personal storage.

Chinese people believing in Bitcoin are likely to hold their coins in hardware wallets. The panic is for people new to the market, big guns capitalised on the increased attention that the 5k roof generated. This is still the aftermath, unless a seasoned trader, I would sit aside and wait for September to be over.

That's because sale is over.

Can drop tomorrow. Can surge tomorrow. You should buy now (golden rule, spend as much you are ready to lose).

As I type now 1 BTC is valued USD 5700.
In 30 minutes might be 5500 or 6000.
You will need to convert it once the job is delivered if you charge him in USD. Otherwise decide a Bitcoin fixed price now (would suggest 0.25 BTC at this stage). In the meantime, if you plan to keep doing this and keep your coins buy a hardware wallet. It will generate the address you need to share to receive the payment.

You can use Coinbase if European (id's for verification) and have a SEPA account for transfers. You can also use local cards if willing to pay the extortionate fees they charge. If not, mycelium app will show you traders in the area  willing to sell you coins.

A. MtGox should have thought a lesson to people leaving coins on exchanges. 
B. BCH fork shows how you don't have control over your coins as they still hold them for their customers. 
C. They are pro S2X so despite their announcements anything can happen to your BTC if and when the fork happens.
