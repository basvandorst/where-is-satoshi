Unless the system administrators and company executives were completely incompetent this was some kind of inside job. They had over 60 million USD in Bitcoin on one fucking address and someone with malicious intent got the key. That's all it took, a 60 million dollar payout for stealing one key some idiot could've had in a text document on their desktop.
People in other comments are saying that their withdrawals for the hours leading up to the site going down weren't going through, and the site was down for hours before the bitcoin was transferred and the company made a statement. This absolutely reeks of an inside job.

People will see "60 million in bitcoins hacked" and then panic thinking that their assets can get hacked and sell. I'm very surprised that Bitcoin didn't get at a dip because of this, it really cemented for me the strength of Bitcoin as an investment

It is never too late. I was iffy about buying a week ago and it has risen almost 50% since. One fucking week and I could've made 500 bucks on my 1000.

It makes it much harder. We know exactly how much they stole and we will know when and where they try to cash out. Every single action they take is on the blockchain, so for them to actually cash this bitcoin out into legal tender without getting caught would be very difficult and expensive for them. It is an absolute shame that people think they can steal from others knowing that they will lose most of it in the process. I don't think they will get even a quarter of the bitcoin they stole transferred into actual money. They took 100 bucks out of our pockets to put 25 into theirs
