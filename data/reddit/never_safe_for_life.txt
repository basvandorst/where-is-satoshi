Yes? Should I be worried posting under a pseudonym on an anonymous forum? I'm aware IPs can be traced down under certain circumstances, and there may be monetary incentive for law enforcement to do so. But tracking down somebody who expressed a sentiment towards committing a crime that doesn't exist yet is quite a stretch.

I would agree it’s rude to make fun of somebody’s opinion, but not their prediction. Predicting the price of any asset is nigh impossible let alone a volatile cryptocurrency. Giving people who post long and convoluted predictions based on nothing a little ribbing is a way of saying “yeah right.”

They got pretty far with the covert surveillance before Snowden blew the whistle, like a fully operational system.

Right? The NSA has pulled off some ridiculously impressive feats. This line of “government isn’t smart enough to pull off an attack” is not sound.

What do you imagine they would be hacking? PCs? Would nobody notice their CPU being maxed out? How long before an antivirus company blocks them?
IoT devices, like webcams, smart sockets, etc? There’s very little power in those to crack ASICS. 
Ultimately I think it’s a theoretical botnet versus an actual net of specialized hardware. I doubt it could win

Remember bitcoin is a speculative bubble right now, it’s value contingent on the technology being proven. If a large unknown attacker disrupted it multiple times in a week, that could very well crash its value.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:51:07
Ha. A politician can get money for any pet project they want using the the age old tactic of trading policy. Problem was the republicans torpedoed every deal because they knew they would be trading real policy wins for an illusory one. 
Dems offered them $25 billion in exchange for amnesty for dreamers. Republicans shot it down. They knew that would lead to a net increase in what they considered immigrants, because the wall would do absolutely nothing to lower border crossings.
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:48:50


That's very interesting to hear. If bitcoin does get attacked and manages to recover, it would increase trust dramatically. I'm curious to hear how this is possible. Andreas' idea that the "good" miners fork the code and write out the "bad" miners is not really viable. Suddenly a trustless network has to trust a handful of humans. What else can they do?
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:12:05
If/when that technology comes to fruition crypto is going to change a lot. However “build a quantum computer” is like saying “build a transporter”
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:54:25
Well, the US government could spend $100 billion per year indefinitely if they so chose. That's just a fraction of their security budget. I'm not sure why they would, but by no means would a state level attacker be bankrupted by such an attack. 
I would propose that an attacker does not need to attack the network forever. If they successfully achieve a 51% attack once or twice something big will happen. One possibility is that bitcoin thwarts it, the attacker is out billions, and trust in the network grows significantly. The other is that they can't overcome it and the whole concept of "trustless, distributed ledger" is proven ineffective. Investors flee as their worst fears are confirmed and the "experiment that is bitcoin" goes down in flames. A few dedicated techies stick around to continue research and some future iteration finds a foothold.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:45:35
Yes, in this scenario the attacker’s is willingly spending money to destroy bitcoin.

Not even close. Nobody can steal your stock shares, transferring them to a random SHA256 hash that no financial regulator can track. Bitcoin is unique in its complete lack of regulation and associated risks you take on owning it.

You see, 1 is a number. One dollar. And a bitcoin is one hundred million satoshis. Therefore soon 1 == 1 is undeniable!
Oh wait, I forgot I meant 1 nickel. Your prediction is off by a factor of 20.

Trustless custodian of your bitcoin via blockchain technology. You can't get it out before 10 years, neither can your relatives suing you, a corrupt money manager, etc. I agree it's a very cool idea and I'm maybe just a tad surprised nobody is talking about it. Only a bit, because people like to have access to their money.

Easiest way to start is to use an exchange like Coinbase.

Well if it’s already been adopted then there’s not much further room for growth, eh? The whole point of this post was we’ve barely scratched the surface in terms of global adoption.

I can't find the article right now, but a researcher asked people of all means how much "enough" would be, and they almost universally said "about double what I have." Didn't matter if they had $100k or $100 million. Seriously, people with a hundred million feel like they could really "live the life" if they just had $200 million. Then those two hundred millionaires start looking at the billionaires...
I actually met a guy who sold his company for $50 million. He said "I'm not rich. Those guys who write NFL player checks for $8 million, those guys are rich." We were sitting on the porch of his multi-million dollar home/estate at the time.
Point is, this is a human thing and you would do well to look at it seriously now. I'm concerned when you say you've "spared every penny" to feed your sense of enough. Are you putting too many eggs in one basket? Do you have a diversified portfolio?
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:19:11
No, you don’t understand. Nobody else is focused on earning dollars. This is the perfect scam, a totally blue ocean concept. Sure to work!

Why not think on that timescale? My private key is mine for as long as the bitcoin network exists. As long as that doesn’t go away that’s forever. Sure it’s overkill, but it’s also good to start thinking on timescales longer that we’re used to.
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:09:00
When there are no more bitcoins to mine nodes will start charging a bigger transaction fee to cover their costs and turn a profit. This was the plan all along and will not come as a surprise to the miners.
Mining has more to do with the need to distribute initial currency than rewarding miners. It's counter-intuitive, but when you start a new currency you start by handing out notes "for free". How else do people start circulating it? Since bitcoin has no central authority there was nobody to handle this transfer. Satoshi had a genius idea of rewarding node owners with coins in exchange for running the network.
@_date: 2019-08-19 06:36:53
You can absolutely generate a private key using a coin. It’s more or less flip it 160 times.

Much less regulation for one. I would hack a few of the top bitcoin addresses and stash the money in a random address then take my time figuring out how to get it anonymously. Hacking a bank, you’ve got the FBI all over you.

If people think bitcoin is a more useful currency with inflation it will go up in value, not down.
That aside, basically yes the protocol could be changed. It would take a quorum of node operators so one individual can’t make the call. If they try, their chain will fork and become a joke like Bitcoin Cash. I’m curious to see in the future if the bitcoin community decides to go this way.

That would dampen people's ability to buy bitcoin. It would also open up a HUGE market opportunity for, say, American Express. 
Drugs are illegal but you can still get them. A secondary market of dealers provides them for cash. Bitcoin won't become illegal, so maybe just just have to go down to your local convenience store and pay cash for bitcoin and pay a fee.

I’m with the previous guy in that I can’t understand what you’re saying, but not in a bad way. More like you are throwing coded jargon out at a lightning fast pace and I am missing a lot of context. I would appreciate if you could explain in a bit more depth. Something about banks funneling money through bitcoin and it’s gonna crash.

Set up a bureaucracy that tracks bank transfers to Facebook or whoever their payment gateway is. Order those transfers to be blocked. I think it would be pretty easy. Sort of like how the US could block Coinbase and that would severely dampen the flow of USD in and out (while not touching the underlying blockchain)

If the number of transactions were truly zero there would not be any miner rewards. The reward comes from successfully adding the next block to the chain, and a block is comprised of transactions. It would become the worlds largest engine idling, burning “gas” but getting nowhere. 
But the author probably doesn’t mean that, more that transaction volume goes down to a very low value. In that case, the argument he’s making is that since bitcoin is worth $10k with a supply of 17 million, what’s it worth next year when there are 18 million? 
Less. However I don’t agree that the price would go to zero. There are only 4 million bitcoin left to mine, about a quarter of what exists, so that means the price should drop by 20%.

Sounds like one of the core developers found this exploit and has instructed everybody to update their software. There’s no indication from the article that would be thieves found the unnamed exploit. This is about as best case as these things go.
