You'll find that car regulations have their basis in horse regulations :-)

They can and do violate regulations and often get away with a little pat on the wrist. Cough HSBC cough.

I would not entirely disagree on that one. Lol.

That deadline is only for exchanging at the central bank which does not have many branches.

Well I wish I could be as diplomatic as you :-)

The issue is that Bitcoin is getting centralised in one location. This is what the article is about, it is not dissing China as you seem to want to make it into. Quite the opposite the article states that it is now Chinese who have to take the lead to transform the future of Bitcoin and if there is indeed a showdown on east/west, it will be the Chinese who wield significant power considering they process up to 90% of all transactions. 
Possibly it suits your agenda to claim everything that discusses China is Xenophobic. The Article also states quite clearly that Chinese sensitivities should be taken into account in discussions.

If you have noticed the article is about how it is, not what it will turn into if someone follows your advice. Currently the situation is such that a Chinese government action can impact Bitcoin. For a country which imposes serious control over every aspect of life, people who invest in Bitcoin should be aware of the situation. No need to shoot the messenger if you don't like the message.

As I have said the article is about the possible ramifications of having so much mining infrastructure in one state that has a strong central government that could if it wants shut down everything. If they pull the plug the ramifications on bitcoin would be severe. It is not that they will but this is a concern for all nations if such concentration was to occur elsewhere as well. There is China bashing agenda here. Just stating of obvious concerns.

China ≠ Bad. All the Bitcoin in one place = Bad

Chinese dissidents are more likely to read foreign media and be aware of what is going around them than Chinese CCP supporters. Agreed. Your point is...?
