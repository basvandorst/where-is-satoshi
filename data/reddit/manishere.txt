There is a version of Multibit classic that lets u set the transaction fee with a slider bar..(i had this exact same problem). even if ur transaction gets stuck u can double spend the balance with a new fee.

Create a new segwit wallet in electrum, new seed etc., send funds there.  Or buy a ledger nano s / trezor etc.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:02:33
not sure what the latest one is tbh, 6 months ago i had the same problem as you, upgraded to the latest version of classic, set the slider to max and sent it to electrum.  You can oftern get transactions through by waiting a day or two at 50 satoshi, check out morning breif with tone vays and jimmy song on youtube, jimmy does a "transaction cost forcast" each day and will let you know when 50 satoshi per byte will get you thru.

Although i am pretty bias towards bitcoin, and it will possibly have a big run in 2018 to 40k, but in that time, i am pretty certain some alts will go up 10,000%.
I personally found out about Bitcoin through Max Kieser on YouTube, you will find the "next big coin" being pumped on various YouTube channels, if you get in early there are massive gains but they are essentially pump and dumps imo, but that could be my bitcoin bias speaking. 
I'd like to say that bitcoin will remain king but we really just dont know that, and at the minute BTC is in a really precarious stage, at a critical price point that will probably dictate at least the next several weeks of price action depending on how the next day or two plays out but to me it doesnt look good.
I wouldnt feel bad about missing out, i got in fall of 2013 and i still feel fomo towards things like Ethereum and dozens of alts i thought looked good but never invested in.
You can never win in this space unless you put $10 on every coin out there haha.  I've heard stories of people putting a few thousand $$ on random alts near the bottom of the coin market cap list before christmas and have cashed out $1mil in january.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:44
you should be selling a percentage of your bitcoin during pullbacks and buying back on the bounces, its been good lately because bounces have been pretty immediate.  I mean im all for the hodlin--when its rising.  When the market turns tho dont ride this down 80% like I did in 2014, worst mistake I ever made.  It is going to feel really sick if it gets to say 20k then pulls back to 5k (or lower) and I didnt sell again and reload lower.  You should be trying to increase your btc holdings and during pullbacks are the easiest time imo.

Yeah just had my worst trading day all year, so my trading style isnt working anymore meaning this could be a real trend change. Should have just sold at 16k and just left it for a few days after that crazy 20k blow-off-top head and shoulders pattern played out, oh well hindsight is a bitch. Too difficult to sell now gone down too much. RSI's are already reaching oversold, felt like bitcoin was in a slow death today which is probably a good sign as unless some whales start dumping huge volumes im hoping for a turn around soon.  Also not sure if the Korea ban is true but that might play out more significantly in the coming days.

bitfinexed on twitter might need your help lol.  Tho seriously I can see this being an issue with a small number of people, it sucks but there will be other opportunities as the world swaps to the blockchain revolution so anyone thinking you've missed out dont.  I had 5mil earthcoins that I lost in Crypsy, they'll probably end up being nothing but I also had thousands of vertcoin and dash (before the rename) so we're all probably going to miss out on millions at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:25:40
both futures are cash settled will not directly effect price but what is likely to happen is that big players will put a large bet on the price going up or down and then buy or sell bitcoin to make that happen.  Maybe a bigger whale will try to wipe them out tho.

I don't see why you cant do both, keep $1,000,000+ safe from governments and fiat devaluation as well as pay for a cup of coffee.  Thats what I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be but now small transactions are being priced out it seems--some in the community have adopted the "we didnt want those transactions anyway" attitude wtf?  We're giving up on international remittance markets too by all accounts, which is a huge "industry".  Lets concentrate on going for international bank settlements then eh, all global oil settled in Bitcoin? $1mil per bitcoin, why not?  Except its 99% probably never going to happen.

I dont think that calculation of 12% (now 6%) includes Bitcoins transaction fee income, just block rewards... although im also not sure if that 6% includes how fast they are finding blocks either so the profitability could be much higher.  If they continue to mine blocks at this speed, in around 30 weeks BCash block reward halves to 6.25 so that's going to certainly effect profitability unless the coin doubles in price of course which is questionable with 9000 coins being produced every day at around $650 each, unless they are all holding them, and I doubt that.

@_date: 2017-08-18 13:47:14
Yeah i'm pretty worried about this also, while r/bitcoin posts memes all day I've been thinking about this a lot lately... 
There is a potential disaster in the works here with Bitcoin coming up, personally i'm 50/50 on buying into bitcoin cash right now even tho its gone up 70% today already, and im pretty die hard on bitcoin and have been for years so this doesn't come lightly.
Reason is that the mining parity between the chains is nearly even, its been like 50% more profitable to mine Bitcoin up till today but with the drop in difficulty on Bitcoin cash and the price rise its down to 2% as of writing this 
When bcash goes above bitcoin on mining profitability, even if 10% of the network swaps to BCash then Bitcoin could be in trouble as it takes 2 weeks for bitcoins difficulty to adjust but BCash made it so the difficulty can drop down alot faster if needed.  So soon there is a possibility nobody is going to be able to send anything on bitcoin as blocks could take an hr to find and blocks are already jam packed as it is, which will probably cause a massive sell off and make BCash even more profitable to mine, not to mention as the hash power moves to bcash the price should go up in correlation.
Bothering me this, just generally the weaknesses in the system, how easy it is to game the system with whales and miners in china etc.  If I wanted to destroy bitcoin, this is the way I would do it, divide and conquer the shit out of it.  
Let me know if i've gotten anything wrong here about the potential of this happening.  I wonder if this will even get near the first page or be down voted into oblivion.
Also Bcash JUST became 2% more profitable to mine than bitcoin...

@_date: 2017-08-24 17:20:14
BCash is currently finding blocks on average every 1-2 minutes so they are going to half block rewards within a year or so, thats going to really hurt the profitability as they have no fee income atm, unless the price rises a hell of a lot or loads of people start using it for transactions, like double or more bitcoins daily transactions today.  So within a year or two it may not even be worth mining.

As an experiment I asked about 25 random people I come across in daily life (barbers, store clerks, mechanics, cab drivers, bar maids etc.) if they had heard of bitcoin and 100% said no, we truly are in the infancy of this revolution even with how far its come already.  But in my work, most of them know I invested in 2013, gasped when it hit $1100 and laughed when it dropped in 2014, now a lot of them ask me to recommend investments in alt coins, thinking that they missed the boat on Bitcoin.

Ok from 2014-2017 I'd say i've been pretty much out of the crypto space, left my BTC in cold storage and forgot about them pretty much so I dont know the political ins and outs + developments that have happened in this industry exactly so there's a few things I'd like to clarify from the community if you can help.
I know Roger Ver as "bitcoin jesus" from the early days of bitcoin he spent alot of time and money promoting its adoption, everybody loved him.  Then I come back in 2017 and he's one of the most hated people, I wasnt exactly sure why but that it was something to do with him wanting bigger blocks and throwing a spanner in the works at every opportunity, or is there something else as well?
I've watched this video and I have to say, if what he says is true, I have a hard time disagreeing with him - why exactly has bitcoin taken this course?  I had absolutely NO idea that the devs working on bitcoin had made those comments layed down in that video.  WHY exactly do the devs think higher fees and long transaction times are good for bitcoin?  And are any of the devs from 2009-2014 still working on the coin?  I know Gavin Andreason left, i know he met with CIA or whatever, i have no idea if the two are related but are there any other original "core" devs working on bitcoin right now?
Please explain why higher fees and slow transaction times are good? Genuine question.. because I thought the devs were working on a solution to the blocks being full and transaction fees being high, not that they liked it, wtf?
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:22:05
Segwit was priced in ages ago, ppl assuming as soon as it activates we'd hit 5000? lol.  "Buy the rumor, sell the fact."
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:40:35
So BCash's blocks are ALWAYS 8mb never any different size?  I ask because this website  shows the size on the right and they never get to 8mb so that makes me think that even though they have an 8mb block size its not actually growing the chain by 8mb per block, making me think issues around having bigger blocks are not so bad in terms of storage and internet connection speed.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:18:57
It was worth sharing, i did something similar in the 2013 "bubble", not anywhere near as much money tho, i bet a lot of people have.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:08:13
It "should" go up again soon but extended periods of stagnation like now usually leads to a huge sell off, so be careful what you wish for.  I bet if it wasnt for Bcash we'd be alot closer to 5000 right now.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:30:47
But I thought the only way to get the miners to support segwit was with the NYA right?  Because they wanted the 2x part and a compromise was made, i.e you agree to segwit and we'll agree to increase the blocks by 2x?  If not what the hell was the point of the NYA?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:57:23

95% of the hashrate is not going to do this long term, just the reality of the situation.  Are you still going to do this if BCH reaches hashrate parity with Bitcoin?  What about if the price between the coins meets at the middle at $2000?  Its going to be a mad one this but either way im going to try and make the most of it by trading both coins against each other.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:15:11
Segwit has already been priced in tho, that was the run to 4500.  Personally because of the BCash/S2x/BitPay etc. FUD i'm not really bullish on BTC anymore, it should have hit near 5,000 but attacks and FUD have destroyed that chance imo.

50% reduction in a year or two? Bitcoin will be in trouble by then with something like a $40 fee to send $100, 20% market share, a million unconfirmed transactions etc.  2x obviously needed now if its going to take a year or two to sort out these high fees and unconfirmed transactions we already have now if Segwit is going to be such a slow burner.  And forget Lightning Network, I had a look at it and it seems overly complicated.  People who have never used Bitcoin struggle using the current wallet system as it is, never mind LN payment channels etc.

When you say nodes being cheap i assume your talking about HDD space, bigger blocks need bigger HDD's?  What are we at like 150gb right now?  Even with an 2-4mb block or even 8mb I find it hard to see that pricing decentralized nodes run by average people out of the system, a 2-4tb HDD is not that expensive and they get cheaper all the time.  Or do you mean internet connection, bigger blocks would require a more expensive internet connection?

I think 90+% of the hashrate of BCH is from one or two unknown actors at the minute too.  Remember when a mining pool got near 50% of the BTC hashrate and everyone moved to other pools? Well BCH has 90%+ hashrate by probably one pool.

Remember we went from like 3000 to 1800 in the month before the fork, this time we have gone from 5000 to 7000 in the month before the fork.  The difference being the first fork had a large degree of uncertainty, this time people know its just free money.  Smart money will most likely be cashing out this time leading into the fork, we could see 5000 very quickly after the fork.

not really up to the core devs, they could change the hashing algo but i'd suggest they didnt as it would cause chaos, and companies would not commit resources to something that might change at any time with billions of capital invested i.e. mining manufacturers.  What needs to happen is a more varied group of manufacturers of mining equipment, more competition in the market will help better than an algo change imo.

I agree, bitcoins governance structure is flawed and im not saying bitcoin cash is any better, but for a start, people shouldnt have been banned from r/bitcoin, and high fees issue should have been addressed more seriously to reflect users and businesses concerns earleir. Maybe then we wouldnt have such a split in the community, essentially fighting each other for dominance.

This was technically the easiest trade in history because everybody knew that 5000 was going to be a huge psychological level similar to 3000 but worse, i even called 4950 and im not a good trader at all, it was just obvious. The way i look at it is that:- on the way up your increasing your fiat position so hodling works, on the way down tho you should be trying to increase your bitcoin position.  Easier said than done I know but thats why I say that 5000 barrier was an obvious high risk pop location so selling around 5000 was less risky than selling, for example, when it hit 3950 and kept going.  If we ever get close to $10,000 selling at 9900-9950 is a potential low risk high reward trade that may only come around once in a blue moon but I believe worth risking bitcoin capital to find out.

The most likely outcome is that Catalonia's leaders will be arrested, parliament dissolved and i wouldn't be surprised to see some sort of reconquest/martial law in the region by the military as a show as force from Madrid. Spain cant afford to let Catalonia leave or Spain, and the Euro/EU are in trouble.  If Catalonia is allowed to leave Spain it might be the catalyst that causes a economic domino effect and global recession.

i lost like a combined 21btc in the 2013 altcoin bubble (inc 5btc in cryptsy), made some, but ended up losing in the end, but 2017 alt bubble ive hardly touched alts and if i do im literally in it for a few minutes, less than an hr anyway then back to bitcoin for a quick profit, just dont be greedy with the alts and end up being a bag holder.  I defo would have been better off just hodling at the end of the day.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:19:15
no your probably right, events like this fork are kind of a given, the whole market expects bitcoin to sell off after or around the fork and alt coins to get a boost so the chance of that trade going badly are less.  The difference is that you dont hodl alts for months and months because against bitcoin they often dont go well, some will but 95% probably wont.  So when your alts go up 10-20% after the fork make sure you take those profits, thats where most of us went wrong and how we lost money, we assumed that cos we bought alts at like 10,000 satoshi we got in early enough to be millionaires if we just hodl long enough, 3 months later they are 1,000 satoshi etc.

@_date: 2017-10-23 05:07:34
look into reading charts, technical analysis, and especially Fibonacci retracements, which bitcoin is quite well correlated to.  One of the best indicators for bitcoin is the 4hr RSI, it almost always sells off when it hits over 70 and bounces when it hits 30 and even tho i dont usually take those trades cos im not watching 24/7, I do sometimes sell when the indicator goes way above 70 indicating an incoming big sell off.

It was a local vulnerability calm ya tits, and its been patched now anyway.  The "thief" needed physical access to the trezor to steal the coins so the trezor's security was essentially downgraded to that of holding gold in a safe in your house, i.e. someone could have come into your house and stole the safe to open it later and retrieve the gold.  Still pretty secure tho.

Its assumed a lower supply = higher price i.e. supply &amp; demand, thats also assuming adoption continues to grow which is likely... halving will spark a new bull wave for sure, if we stay in this bear market until 6-12 months before the next halving the bull run will probably be massive.  Tho I'm expecting weekly RSI to get oversold at some point before the next real bull run begins, so until then we should all be just quick flipping crypto, using stop losses if ur long to protect capital.

I'm pretty sure we will hit 5.5k (and/or lower) at some point so just set ur buy orders and leave them, i wouldn't fomo back in at this point.
Before you guys who always sell at the bottom consider selling, check the charts, look specifically at the Relative Strength Index, is the 1hr, 4hr and daily charts RSI below 30, mid 20's or in the teens? - Yes?  Then dont sell!  If any of you want to sell 7500 is probably all were getting before another pull back, maybe 7800 if were lucky, if we retest 6000-6500 it probably wont hold this time imo.

Difficult with $100 but..
Maybe ***
Stratis, (similar to Ethereum using Microsoft tech)
EOS, (probably going to drop slowly until 2018 if not summer 2018, could be big)
Factom (less likely to be huge price but useful)
Litecoin (one of the oldest, Trusted dev/creator)
Ethereum (if it gets cheap enough)
Dash (untraceable, seem a good dev team and roadmap for future)
NEM (not done enuf research, cheap but lots of coins tho)
IOTA (not done enuf research cheap but lots of coins tho))
Moneroo (similar to dash)
TenX (debit card for crypto's)
Monaco (similar to tenx)...
I'm sure there are quite a few others but havent researched them all, need to do your own research. Search for "upcoming ICO's" too, maybe you will find something that appeals to you.
Good luck.

@_date: 2017-07-16 17:52:35
God knows, all speculation, maybe $700 (oversold) to $1000 but even i cant see it going below a $1000 anytime soon... I know a few that have buy orders around $1300-$1500, if it gets there or not is another matter.  It has, in the past, crashed down to the spike from previous high... so summer 2013 went to $266... October $1100... slow decline... late 2014 $200.... this time it went to nearly $3000... trend would suggest around $1100, its previous high from 2013.  Fibonacci retracement lines work amazingly well with bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:11:05
Don't invest until you have done your research... though you could invest that $100 into BTC (when ready) then buy one of the other cheaper potentially good coins for the future, leave it for 5 years and pay off your student loans when the time is right, like a lot of the Ethereum students investors did this year.

Wouldnt a correction be a short term thing? not every day lower lows and lower highs... June 11 to 15th was a genuine correction/profit taking imo... at what point does it stop being called a correction?  I think everyone is waiting to see what happens with the forking, it could possibly be the case that everything works out great but investors don't come back in until certain price points are reached in this new bear market.  Eg. after the fork, everything is fine, but price still drops, then the real panic will begin and smart money whales probably know this and exploit it.

With a name like supreme-n00b why am i not surprised. Never do this... like people who mortgage their house to buy into bitcoin at the top, its not smart imo.  There is a reason why people say "invest only what you can afford to lose". Instead of buying cigarettes, pot, alcohol or buying that new shiny car, use the money that would have gone on those things on BTC instead.  I know a few people who invest 10% of their disposable income into Bitcoin each month, which is a fairly sensible investment strategy imo.

Bitcoin Cash support seems to be from the people who were pushing for Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin ABC etc. (which failed).  
Imo its mainly just pissed off large holders (early adopters) of Bitcoin who disagree with the direction the Bitcoin dev team are taking us, plus they believe they are moving too slow.
This is mostly because alt coins have captured some of Bitcoins thunder recently.
It all basically comes down to scaling the bitcoin network to potentially handle transaction volumes higher than a company such as Visa or MasterCard etc. (tho we are a long way off that yet).
It also comes down to speed of adoption, large holders get richer the faster bitcoin spreads around the world and generally the more people use it the higher the price goes.
Currently only 10-20mil people I believe use bitcoin (though it is probably less due to people having multiple wallets etc.) and the price is already nearing $3,000, imagine the price if the billions of un-banked (the poor) people started using bitcoin.
They believe that a 1mb block size is too small to achieve mass adoption on that level before Bitcoin is replaced by an alt coin competitor.
1mb block size also results in high transaction fees as more people use Bitcoin, which is pricing bitcoin out of growth in large population areas of the world, i.e. the poor, who are completely un-banked, such as people in places like India, Africa, China etc. 
This is evident with the recent announcement of some company using IOTA as a replacement for Bitcoin in international remittances due to IOTA having "zero" transaction fees.
So BCC will fork from BTC and launch with a 8mb block size instead of BTC's 1mb, this potentially means that BCC can handle a lot more transactions per block, also making the transaction fees a lot cheaper, so more un-banked people around the world will use it.
Its important to note that the BTC dev team are working on a path to this solution and the first step is Segwit and then Lightning Network, they just cant wait I guess.

No coinbase is just a trusted on and off ramp, like people have not had problem withdrawing FIAT from them, same with Bitstamp in for Europe (ive used them).  Coinbase only trade Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin I believe (ive never used them they are for US customers tbh), you could try Kraken another US exchange that trades more currencies, but I dont know if they have problems withdrawing fiat currencies or not, i think Bitfinex is another US site, i use them sometimes.  I think Polinex is pretty much the biggest, I think they trade the most varied currency pairs but have heard bad things about them (never used them btw) when trying to withdraw funds, including bitcoin so be careful.   rule NEVER LEAVE COINS ON EXCHANGES!  Get in, get out or risk losing your money to 3rd party risk.
Coinbase are going a bit insane at the minute, they are being political and halting withdrawals because of segwit, you need to hurry or wait until after august because all exchanges will halt trading around august due to potential fork.
You can see a list of markets here: 
This site is very useful, though you should already know about it.
You really need to play with this technology before you commit anything major, send $5, buy 0.01 or whatever, transfer it to an Electrum wallet on your desktop, learn how to use it, send funds from your desktop to another wallet on your phone, just to work out how it all works.  Just remember as we get closer to august the risk of problems grows, most people will have all their BTC off exchanges in private wallets and will not be sending funds anywhere around August 1st until the dust settles and we know whats happening.

Can someone please answer this valid question I have about the funding of bitcoin, I love the concept of this but i cant grasp how it gets its value so high, $9 billion or so?  Has bitcoin actually accumulated that much?  Because the way I see it, there is probably only 10% of that (probably less) in the system spread among all the exchanges, it kind of seems like a ponzi scheme because the people who mined all those bitcoins never put any cash into the system but they are selling out at the expense of new investors coming in?  Is this not a valid point and a problem for the future?  Or am i missing something?  Such as everybody hording them? (probably).

@_date: 2013-12-06 20:00:23
I agree apart from a few things... I traded and lost a 1/2 of my btc while the thing was rising out of control, you sell out at the high (or what you think is the high) and then suddenly its 100 bucks higher, not good.  Now the price has sort of stabilized to a 1200 psychological barrier it makes it easier to trade, especially on a downswing, I sold and traded at this level and with other currencies, ive made my btc back. i also cashed out my original investment so I dont have to stress about loosing anything.  Now i keep 25% of my btc in cash ready to buy at times like these.  Trading isnt as bad as it seems, its just kind of overly stressful and has an expensive learning curve (at least for me), but yeah if you wana save yourself alot of stress just leave them.  I did find that i could relax alot more if i had cash laying around to buy on the lows instead of just watching my btc loose value.
