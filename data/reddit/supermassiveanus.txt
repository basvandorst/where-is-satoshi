The news is usually just articles overhyping things

Also with manipulating atoms we can possibly create gold cheaply in the future

Would it get confirmed if it was no fee?

Like lightning network and opening payment channels

Why would stocks and metals necessarily increase? technology progresses exponentially and with growing self ownership, self reliance that tech provides why wouldnt there be a chance the only asset is time and ability

The address balances should show up in any block explorer

True, true. Let's not forget the most valuable asset, time. With time you can do/create anything you decide to.

Existence is worthless too

Humanity progresses to the point ai takes over and investing is moot.
If everything becomes based on logic, then humans will be primitive

Not that fascinating

Bcash is the best day trade there is. Why ho when you can get in on original BTC volatility like BCH has

Check out the sub and see for yourself. It's Bitcoin fundamentals. Not spamming alt coins as you said it was for
@_date: 2018-04-14 13:26:12
Always HODL
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:12:16
As it should

Judging by how r/btc is anything but endless forks I'd say your statement is inaccurate
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:29:24
He thinks he's about to make it
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:10:34
Not paid but the returns feel nice so far XD
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:16:48
r/btc was formed for a reason and before Bitcoin cash. Do you remember why r/btc was originally formed? Don't be afraid of digging deeper. The truth will set you free.

Well maybe there are overly exuberant redditors here and there but some of the supporter were die hard BTC supporters not cuz of the name but because of what it stood for. The saying goes, you only own what is on chain.
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:26:23
The other forks can't be compared to this one. Just look at the BCH community. It's not just a get rich scheme the people around it are more a kin to the BTC supporters of the past
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:06:47
It's not crazy tricks. The community split and each side is a chain from the Genesis block. Of course there is drama on who is more legit. BCH believes big blocks and on chain for now. BTC wants sidechains asap. It may be that BCH will require off chain scaling too but the way BTC developers didn't want to make cheap on chain transactions available while still possible is why the split occured. BTC seems to justify this off chain system as "planning ahead". BCH will adjust when it has to through community agreement
