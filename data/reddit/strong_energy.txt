If it was that easy lol. the thing with the stock market and cryto currencies and among other stuff, is that is is unpredictable. if you actually came up with a formula or trend on the market you would be a rich. I think as you think...that btc will surpass the highest price, but we dont know when. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:59:25
it peeked at about 3.5k
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:12:19
thanks will look into it.

dollar falling because of potential use mx border closure? 
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:06:56
or last even a couple hours. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:10:25
well I bought BTC for 2 reasons. An alternative to regular money. and reason 2 for investment.
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:28:01
Lmfao that thing is good though.
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:47:03
too good to be true.
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:56:18
we are on free fall.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:44:21
true. I think that for now I'm just going to buy more. but not as aggressive. I really hope bitcoin becomes more stable. reason being. more people and business would be glad to accept such currency. no one would want to buy a currency that at any given point it might just free fall over night.

perfect example to lose 150 M
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:06:29
I bought at around 3k. I'm relatively new to the BTC market. I have seen it spike up and only last a couple of days.
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:01:38
My bad it was 5.3k
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:55:48
Bet on 9k then drop to free fall 
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:41:40
this is a good time to buy again. I bought at 3.9k
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:11:47
it is estimated that bitcoins will ran out in more than 100 years from now. my predictions is that btc value will be high and stable. it will be like having gold but with the ability to be used everywhere as a payment.
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:28:23
Actually I think its making it go down.
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:53:16
it should work if you have US dollar currency.
@_date: 2019-05-02 23:02:13
this one Trezor Model T &amp; Cryptosteel Mnemonic Bundle? from Amazon.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:29:53
Lmfao. We going at a good pace at the moment. this rocket is comfy.
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:46:18
from the resent hack. I heard Binance will give the money back to the affected customers.(I think Binance had some kind of insurance). But who knows how long it will take for them to get their btc back in their accounts(which that is a lose in profit considering that btc is now at 6.2k lol . in contrast if someone hacks your private wallet and somehow gets your keys, then you are pretty much done. both have their downfalls.
@_date: 2019-05-08 23:39:20
well a counter argument can be that in Ponzi schemes chains most people get there money back plus profit, no profit if the business doesn't work. Now in the case of bitcoin, I would say it is more of a gamble. it is more of a winners and losers game.
@_date: 2019-05-05 21:18:04
best place to buy bitcoins? I want to avoid Coinbase fees.
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:21:28
well selling before it hit 6k? hope you don't regret it when it hits 10k
@_date: 2019-05-02 15:14:37
Bears are about to wake up at 6k
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:41:05
you have to download an app called Flexa. I don't know if you can use it already but that's the app advertising that whole foods Starbucks take bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:59:05
do it now bro. BTC hitting 7k soon.
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:15:49
I heard Binance had an insurance and customers didn't get affected only the company?
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:52:18
yo what is going on tonight? 7k tonight or what?
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:39:04
Yeah free money for the hackers, but the funny part is that they actually know when they move the bitcoin around. Eventually someone will get caught.

Who would want to sell while  aboard the space ship?
