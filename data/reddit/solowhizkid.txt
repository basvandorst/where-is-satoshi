The boys from bitcoin uncensored are a bunch of morans who actually need to go back to first grade and learn English and maths and by the way learn to speak to people correctly

trust me i get to vote and i aint that weatlhy, its just that i bought into the currency at the right time and invested savings into a masternode. We've actually voted on proposals to improve the coins since 2014 to where it is now, thats from $0 &gt; $200 - i'd  call that a huge improvement.

I can tell you whats good!
1. Instant Transactions, no waiting around like bitcoin or other alts from hours to mins to confirm a transaction has gone through
2. Decentralised DAO - Something the other coins lack
3. Bugdgeting system whereby the coin pays for itself to be constantly improved - This is currenlty about $1 million + dollars a month
4. An incentivised network - where users get paid for services they provide to the network (Miners,Masternodes &amp; treasury)
5. Buidling &amp; release of Evolution - soon to be released
7. The first in providing unique features such as:
   - Decentralised API (DAPI) - No more downloading of huge blockchains
   - 2nd Tier network (Masternodes)
   - Instant send
   - Private send (Privacy is an option)
   - Paypal like experience (no more long cryptographic addresses) - So even your mother could use it
   - Vault Accounts
   - ISA like savings accounts
   - Real UI friendly experience wallet (due to be released soon)
   - An effective Governance model
   - and this list goes on and on!
I emplore you to research more yourself
