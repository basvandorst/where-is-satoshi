Isn’t this more of a government issue than a currency issue?

I’m gonna keep an eye out for these now...

So you’d rather have like a $0.40 mininimum wage?

Wouldn’t this effect the dollar’s value?  A lot of US currency out in the world, is currency that will never renter the US again, so in essence, it’s money that helps increase the value of the US dollar.  Criminal organizations around the world essentially give the US gov a loan that will never be collected in.  If these organizations switch to crypto, then wouldn’t this essentially hurt the US?

But why?  Seriously?  With a global currency like this, there would be no way to have any local adjustments.  It’s crazy.  A hot dog in new York might cost the same as a whole cow in Africa.

It’s a crash for anyone that bought  well above $6,000, or you can call it a correction if you like.

I Just don’t understand how any nation would give up control of their currency.   You’d have no control over inflation or deflation.

It’s not a security, it’s a commodity.

But gold has a lot of uses.  What are bit coin’s other uses?
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:58:16
Like gold but with no practical use?

How is this not going to creat a huge problem for Nigeria?

It will be if you bought at $220k...
