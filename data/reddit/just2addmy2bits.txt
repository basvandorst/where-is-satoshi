Building new sites, based solely on a new currency, isn't going to work.  Your competition are the established players in the same space.  If they implement bitcoins on their site, your site is toast.  of course, if you're up against slow competition (eg. a service provided by say, the government) then, you're free and clear.  I don't think this site b-lancer.com is it.

"Criminals" are only defined as such, by arbitrary rules set by their own governments.  I actually think most drug dealers just want to provide a good at the highest price, while minimizing their own costs.  I think 51% of the network would be honest in their handling of BTC, and only look to break the law where there was "honorable" financial motivation for doing so. ie, evading government, by staying anonymous.

@_date: 2013-04-16 12:51:31
Understood.  Except d = f(rate of adoption).  The more adoption, the more deflation.  This forces lenders to consider the rate of adoption while setting interest rates.  But the act of a loan, is in fact adoption, which forces the rate of deflation higher.
Maybe there is one more conclusion needed.  Either adoption is impossible, or lenders will get screwed.

@_date: 2013-04-03 15:16:36
That's a good answer - except it assumes zero-panic. Human emotion makes markets more volatile than they otherwise should be.  So, the act of the fed bidding a BTC from $140 to $300, the market takes it to $500, but then it naturally starts to crash back to say $250.  Now the fed can take it lower than $140.  How much lower? Depends on liquidity.

Your problem, and why you feel trolled, is because you're using the wrong terminology and these sticklers aren't pointing that out.
You're using the words like efficient, fair, and markup incorrectly, given that the discussion has turned highly academic.
Your last sentence, is still not correct.
In economic geek speek...
The **efficiency** of a market refers to how quickly that market responds to new information. It does not attempt to quantify if a given markup is reasonable. 
The **markup** of price refers to profit margin added, to the cost of goods sold, required for accepting a level of risk to participate in a supply chain.  While you may believe that a 30% markup on a financial transaction is absurd, the seller clearly feels otherwise.  After all, this person has the risk of meeting all kinds of risky/dodgy characters, in person, with cash.  He has to deal with no-shows.  He has to deal with costs of gas.  If 9 out of 10 appointments don't show, and he has to drive an average of 15 minutes per appointment, and his average transaction is 3BTC, and most of them are criminals, I would say a 30% mark-up is reasonable given the risks.
A **fair market price** is the price at which two parties will trade for a given asset.  It does not attempt to quantify consumer-surplus or producer surplus.  If you want the benefit of anonymous BTC, and you could buy BTC anonymously at $102 USD, your consumer surplus might be on the order of what? $10? $20? $35?  Only the buyer can determine this, as this is up to the individual.

Sorry, when I said "backed by assets", I meant to write, "backed by a going concern".  
Calling the total outstanding bitcoins, the "stock" of bitcoins, is a correct use.  But in the context above, we were using the word "stock", to reference the share of a company. 
You can calculate the fair market value of a share in a company.
You can not calculate the fair market value of a USD, CAD or BTC.
A currency is the unit of fair market value.
Comparing Bitcoins to shares of a company, is as dumb as comparing mph to a car, or say, comparing USD to a car.

At first I thought that it was wallets, but the data is actually addresses. I too quickly jumped to the conclusion that there was only 1 wallet, per person.  In reality, the # of wallets per person would be &gt;1.  
Anyway, what went through my brain, was that the majority of people, all creating this buzz over BTC, were all users with less than $100 on the line.
The reality is, the average user probably own a single wallet with &gt; 1 BTC and 3 or 4 addresses with  &lt; 1 BTC in them.

So - almost 10% of the current supply, might be "lost". Forever, possibly.
Huh. Wow.

Double spending would be the same as creating coins out of thin air, is it not?

So far you've said literally nothing to try to correct anything I've said. All you've done is called me wrong. 
Below is a link to a report I publish on an adhoc basis, from the data dump that comes from what my automated trading strategy uses.
My point is that I have a fairly decent grasps of markets, and the FED could do this.
Either way, good luck, Try HARDER.
Edit: to add.
Edit 2: to add link to the report I publish.

There are often times many arb opportunities.

This is interesting.

Yah, I agree that the maximum upper bound is orders of magnitude higher. It's just, not a useful number.
And, I don't think the minimum of the lower bound has to be zero.  At least, with the addition of one more assumption, it wouldn't be zero.
That assumption woud be:
Criminals will always exist and want to move money between borders.

I signed up on two separate exchanges, when the price was in the 90s.  The coins are now in my wallet, I paid an effective $99USD for them.

Vote with your wallet people.  Plenty of other exchanges, other than Mt. Gox. If you're in north america, or europe, there are tons of other options to fund an account at another exchange.

We should plan a $200-crossing party, on and all vote up the "Krugman was wrong about bitcoins in 2011 post."

To compare, how do you think it will feel when a new person buys a coin for $1056 in 2015, right before it crashes back to $320?

You think FB could buy every BTC?  That would be 10% of their cash - if every single BTC was on offer.  That CFO, and half the board, would all lose their job.
Unless BTC crashes in the next few days, there is no stopping this thing.

I'm saying it would make a ton of sense for it to try to grab a slice of the payment processing industry.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:47:56
The same could be said for your reply.  Which statement exactly wasn't based on logic?

It's definately has enough attention, for the underground economy to keep it propped up.

What do we do, if they say merchants who accept it, will be fined proportional to their sales?
