Yup, aware of Lineage OS being based on AOSP. Android is a great OS, just like Windows is a great OS; the problem, like I said, is that in order to use a Google-variant of Android, you have Google Play Services so deeply-tied into the OS, that you can't really get rid of it, short of building a new "distro" based on AOSP. I would want to use an AOSP version of the OS because Google is coming to a point of having so much information about people that it's actually very scary from a privacy standpoint. Even if Google is completely altruistic, there are legal requirements that might necessitate them opening up a LOT of information about people.
I don't have a problem with AOSP-based OSes, but I really have had a different experience than you in getting an OS loaded. Locked bootloaders, caveats about various parts of the hardware not running, having to tether and run things in debug mode on the phone, having to dig through hundreds of different ROMs to find one that matches your device...none of that is a reasonable expectation of a normal user.
I do wish either Ubuntu or Firefox's OS would have succeeded. They would have provided a great alternative to the options available presently.

Actually, I'm more frustrated with the mobile landscape. If you want to use Linux on a desktop, it's never been easier. I split my desktop time in roughly quarters (Windows 10, Mac OS, Ubuntu, Chrome OS). I think Linux is going to have a hard time making inroads on the desktop/laptop at this point simply because it's a market that isn't growing (and is probably shrinking). Linux isn't going to take over in most workplaces (bleeding-edge tech companies like Google notwithstanding), the only place left is consumers, and they're shifting away from the desktop.
So back to my original point, if you want to use a "free" operating system on mobile, it's practically impossible. I know that the immediate response is likely "But Android is Linux!", but unfortunately Google has their services so intertwined with Android that it becomes practically unusable without them.
Obviously the next answer is "Well just use Lineage OS then"; so I did. And you know what? Installing it was a living nightmare. Linux on desktop has gotten to the point of just popping in a USB drive with the image, clicking through a few steps, and you have Linux. I *really* know a lot about software, installing OSes, etc. I'm very comfortable with it, and trying to take an Android phone, even one with high compatibility with Lineage OS, over to Lineage was a truly awful experience. That's not a knock at all on the developers/maintainers of that ROM, it's an honest assessment of the mobile landscape. Driver support is terrible, hardware is incredibly closed, standards are followed a lot more loosely, it's just not good.
So the point here is that more and more users are making mobile their main/only computing experience, and yet from an open-source OS platform standpoint, it feels like all the gains on Linux have been lost, and I'm back to trying to install Redhat 6.0 in the late 90s...except maybe even worse, because there isn't nearly the "we need to support/embrace open hardware/software" community. It's more like the community just accepts that it sucks. It's a real bummer.

Hi this is fascinating. Good on you!
I see you donated to the EFF, which is fantastic. In light of the awfulness of what the ISPs are doing to Net Neutrality, one way to combat them is via municipal broadband efforts. I put exactly 3 minutes of research into a non-profit to support that, so please do more due-diligence than that, but here's an option:
Unlike the bigger charities, I bet some of these smaller charities could really appreciate even a smaller donation.
Also, a financial question: I'm hoping you've talked to a financial person (and not just your local branch guy, go to some NYC hot-shot) about creating a fund for yourself where you're not just donating off of your principal. It might not be as flashy, but take that $86m, put it in a safe, low-interest fund, and make it last forever. 3% of $80m is about $2.5m a year for the rest of time.
Whatever you do, you're being an awesome person, cheers and happy holidays to you!

Not a bad idea, ethical concerns aside. Also, you accidentally used the word "Timestomp", but I desperately want that to be a real word that has applicability in life situations.

That's the whole point, make it so attractive that your excitement overrides your senses. Something like $4m in BTC would probably be a great way to do that, plus it sort of self-selects people that are tech-savvy enough to know what a bitcoin is, and so they're probably more likely to be accessing technical data on a regular basis.

This is exactly what I was going to say. when you start working with the drive, make sure:
1. It's not on a computer with any sensitive data on it.
2. It's on a computer not connected to the internet.
Paranoid? Possibly. But attacks have happened in the past by labeling hard drives with information that would be interesting/attractive to targets.

When you change your mind not because you acquired new information and grew as a person, but instead because you wanted to try to kill an idea that you have no control over, in an attempt to inject a different idea that you have more control over, it doesn't mean you changed your opinion, it means you're an asshole.

Reminds me of this (just replace doorknobs and fire extinguishers for your list).

My favorite stat is social security. "Don't worry, Social Security is in great shape, and won't have solvency problems until 2037, or roughly when the middle of Gen-X is getting ready to retire..."

Don't forget being born in a time where there were 5 computers in the world, and retiring at a time when the computer in their pockets is 1,000,000x more powerful than those 5 computers combined.

They also likely would have diluted his shares down to nothing, as is tradition.

Maybe try saving it locally? I don't think there are player controls in the link. I could be wrong though, I didn't try it.

The government cares about NASA, it's part of their international marketing package. But they only care insofar as NASA is " That's why, ever since winning the space race, it's been used more as a political tool. If/when China passes NASA's accomplishments, NASA will be given a bigger budget and a focused mission.
Hopefully SpaceX can disrupt that short-sighted process.
