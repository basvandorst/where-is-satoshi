Hey guys, I was just an observer.  I'm pretty new to bitcoin myself.
This is exactly what happened.  And there was a group meeting there tonight and all but one person still thought the place had been hacked!
I'll try to change the title of the post to reflect the new insights.
So gruff, dude.  Buy a Bitcoin!  :)!!!

[WHAT REALLY HAPPENED] Ok, so I stopped back into the bookstore this evening to get some sunglasses I left there last night.  Here's the full story.
THE BITCOIN WAS NOT HACKED.  When I left last night that was the consensus.  It took a while longer to figure out what had happened.
I spoke with the owner of the bookstore, and it turns out the whole (resolved) situation was caused by 1) the owner; 2) the customer; and 3) the Coinbase app and website.
It all began with a guy going, "I'd like to buy that for $2 in Bitcoin."  So he gets a soda, pulls out his phone, and tries to pay with his Coinbase app.  Somehow the QR code read 2btc and not $2.  They all blame the app for this part.
The guy was frantic.  He said, "Stop the meeting, there's been a mistake!"  He was telling us the bookstore had sent someone else 2btc instead of charging them $2.  It made no sense, but he was upset, and the whole thing was off to a confusing start.  It was at this point I left, with about 7 people standing around the register and a guy going, "I think it's a hack.  I've heard of this happening."  Everyone looked very demoralized.
In about 20 minutes the bookstore realized they'd received 2btc.  So at this point everybody knew where it was and what had happened.  The guy goes, "I want you to deposit the money back into my Coinbase wallet."  So they pull up his Coinbase account on he computer and copy and paste the address into their merchant client or whatever.  At this point the money disappeared down a black hole.
I guess it was suspected at this point the first time visitor to the meetup was running a scam, which was odd considering he'd brought everyone sandwiches.
HOWEVER, it turns out the built in Coinbase copy and paste feature on the website had not worked.  Somehow the owner of the bookstore had copied his own Bitcoin wallet address into the refund and he now had the money.  But he didn't know.  They blame the website here.
Another 20 mins later they finally found the money, with some accusing the bookstore owner of running a scam on top of a scam.  Jokingly, I'm sure.
That's the sordid tale, guys.  I told the owner and founder of the bookstore about the concern pouring out on this subreddit, and he was really moved.  He's very embarrassed about the whole thing, and I promised to treat him kindly in the retelling.
There you go.

Take a chill pill, man.  I'm younger and better looking than you.  Is that a crime?  😚
