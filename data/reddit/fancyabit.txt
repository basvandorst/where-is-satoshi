I've also used justcoin.com in the past also but much prefer bitstamp.

Cheers cowboy for the welcome message :)
I've ran this software after I tried out armory and as it doesn't download the blockchain I had it up and running pretty much straight away which was terrific, however, I was a little concerned about not having a wallet file thus not knowing where my coins would be held so didn't pursue it further.

Yip, bitstamp.net

.ch (so buy Chinese twat?)
I actually like the name and didn't realise .ch was even an extension

I probably would too. Out of interest though, what other features would you hope to see in it? 
If it was linked to xe.com and worked out equivalent in euros and had other exchanges, then I'd definitely pay for it but rather than eat my battery I'd also like a website linked to my account/settings so you wouldn't need to have it connected all the time.

Isn't this proof that blockchain.info is secure then? Lock it down to ip if you have a fixed ip address and enable second 'spending/withdrawl' password. 
I have some on it and Im very very satisfied with the service.

I know that but I've a mate who gambles and when i tell him about bitcoin it would be good to have a rough guess on the odds of 'a big winner' so to speak

Cool, I wrote the exact same thing last week but for bitstamp but its on my local network. Good luck with the site, I would have used it if I didn't have my own

Actually, yeah i need to do this for my bitstamp account as it has google authenticator running. Thanks for the reminder
