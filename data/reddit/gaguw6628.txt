Node count != decentralisation. Eth has greater pool centralisation.
Sha256d is already well understood and is already in silicon. Short of shrinking die size, optimisations are limited.
"ASIC-resistant" algos are open to endless secret optimisations favouring those in the know.
You do realise ethash was supposed to be ASIC-resistant? It was secretly ASIC-mined.. with publicly available miners only now coming to market. These memory-hard ethash ASIC miners have significantly higher capex... resulting in even higher centralisation.
It is a bunch of nonsense. GPUs are good for bootstrapping a new coin... but it pointless long term.

Batching is what permits miners to agree on *order*. Order is required to solve the double-spend problem.
Nodes are distributed throughout the world and they receive broadcasted transactions at *different times* relative to each other. How are they supposed to agree on order without batching?
POW introduces a poisson process that breaks up the processing of transactions into intervals. *This is the invention* that is Bitcoin. Blocks are part of the solution. Block propagation issues are the trade-off of the design.

Nakamoto consensus enables decentralised consensus in an *automated* fashion. This lowers cost and counterparty risk. This is why rolling-checkpoints are so very wrong. Honest miners can never automatically converge back to the longer honest-chain post attack.
Ultimately people own the currency and network however. A chain rollback due to the 184 Billion bitcoin bug had overwhelming human consensus. Probably nothing since has gained as wide spread support. The very existence of the currency itself was threatened. There was the Berkeley DB fork.. but even that caused differing opinions.

In the context of the internet (as mentioned by the article), Bitcoin did first provide the first practical solution.
The PBFT solution cited below is not applicable to unreliable networks such as the internet. PBFT is very comminication-heavy and possibly more reliant on some trust models (as I understand it). PBFT also does not stand up well to overwhelming Sybil attacks.. which is extremely easy to perform over the internet.
It is also important to note that nobody truly 'solved' anything. In fact, I believe the two generals and wider Byzantine problems have been proven to be unsolvable. The 'practical' in PBFT is just that - a practical solution for distributed systems. In the case of Bitcoin, PoW makes it prohibitively expensive to be a bad general.

SHA256d miners have a huge supply chain that has taken years to be built. No other coin other than BCH uses it.
Other SHA256d coins were 51% attacked into oblivion. BCH survives because it has second-strike capability... there are heavy BCH holders who also mine BTC.
As a result, BTC is by far the most secure decentralised network. GPU-POW is fragmented into a thousand coins.. none of which are secure with the exception of eth, but more centralised than btc.

How does GPU-mining favour the lower class?

Correct. CPUs.. then secret GPU/FPGA mining.. then public GPU mining for us mere plebeians... then secret ASICs.. then eventually (thankfully) public ASICs... and out of the bootstrapping phase. Now hopefully in a maturing supply chain phase.

"Instead of PoW, we need a different system to guarantee network security that doesn’t cost that much energy. In addition, the number of transactions to be processed must be drastically increased in order to bring down the price of a transaction."
POW does not need to change. Tying POW to the creation of the native token is the brilliant invention.
The price of a transaction is not block-value / tx-count. The (current) primary purpose of mining a block is to release the block rewards (from miner's perspective). Transactions are secondary, but also necessary to enable circulation. Without circulation, I doubt there would be value. Fees will need to play a bigger role in future.

You require blocks or intervals... as it permits miners to agree on *order*. Order is required to solve the double-spend problem.
Nodes are distributed throughout the world and they receive broadcasted transactions at *different times* relative to each other. How are they supposed to agree on order without batching? Further, nodes may not have the same transactions as each other in their mempool.

"To scale systems like Bitcoin to 10-100x its current size, the authors propose a novel PoW algorithm, Optical Proof of Work (oPoW).."
PoW has little to do with scaling transaction throughput. Orphan rates and verification overheads dominate this area of research.
There is no way to bootstrap CAPEX-focused PoW. SHA256d succeeded because it enabled *anyone* with a GPU to initially mine.
Who will initially build the oPoW miners? Who will be able to afford them?
Isn't power consumption also relative? If oPoW miners dominated the market, CAPEX costs would come down.. with electricity eventually becoming the dominating metric for profitability.
Electricity is in abundance worldwide. Geography is not a huge issue for bitcoin. Unmanned mining shipping containers can be sent anywhere in the world, chasing inexpensive/renewable/stranded electricity.
Simple/cheap POW ASICs (not encumbered by patents) offer the best model for acheiving high levels of security and decentralisation. The ecosystem around SHA256d and its supply chain has taken years to build and mature.
I suspect many let their social/green conscience cloud their view of POW, lowering their security standards. POW favours the entrepreneur and 'disruption'. Miners chase block value, and thus cheap power. Governments don't like miners leaching subsidised power and it will be interesting to see how far miners will go and innovate to find that source of stable/cheap power.
Interesting research nonetheless.

Andreas is right and wrong here.
He is most likely correct that no government has to ability to pull off a covert operation to take over Bitcoin. However, he is wrong when he says "we are all going to stay on the old fork".
The whitepaper says "nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone."
There is no "old fork" in this scenario. "Fedcoin" would be the chaintip with the most work. If the rest of the network hacked the client to "ignore" the fedcoin chaintip.. the fedcoin could just rinse and repeat, causing multiple forks.
*This is the invention of Bitcoin*. The *assumption* that no single entity could sustain this attack indefinately.
His argument stating inefficiencies of government was enough. Staying on a minority fork against a more powerful attacker is just fantasy. If this happened, Bitcoin would be broken. This is a real concern with Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash can be attacked at anytime with hash from Bitcoin. BCH implemented "rolling checkpointing" nonsense, which is akin to what Andreas is suggesting here.

Mining rewards the entrepreneur, the prospector. A degree is not required. It does help if you have money, but even that is not enough. Many people have been taken for a ride buying unprofitable hardware. Mining can also reward the unscrupulous (subsidized/stolen electricity etc), which is unfortunate.

No a 'segwit' block has witnesses in a separate data structure. This is how an old node can verify the block hash without downloading and parsing the witness data structure.
I can literally give you the block header and the transaction merkle tree only. You can then verify the POW and re-calculate the block hash. The separate segwit data structure is not required.
Some conflate the above by saying a segwit UTXO is not a 'chain of digital signatures'. It still is. It is now a majority consensus rule to parse and verify the separate witness data structure. Without doing so .. a miner is effectively SPV mining.
The serialization of transaction/block data for transmission between old/new nodes is a separate matter.

The "big four" (banks) have enormous reach here.
People think their bank deposits have a government guarantee of up to $250,000. Little do they realise this guarantee is per ADI ("authorised deposit taking institution"). The big 4 own virtually all of the major players. E.g., "Ubank" is owned by NAB. So if you have $500,000 spread over both banks, there is only one parent (NAB).. so you are only protected once.
Further, each ADI would only receive a capped provision of $20 billion in guarantees should it fail. NAB has $300 billion in deposits. CBA has $600 billion! 3% on the dollar guaranteed? Any further bailout would need to be debated and authorised by government.

The purpose was not to be more 'efficient', but rather separate the signatures from the transaction data. Signatures are malleable, meaning the resulting transaction hash can be changed by a third party. While the malleated transaction is still valid, the change makes it more difficult keep track of payments and smart contracts.
In terms of implementation.. the devs wanted to avoid hardforks. Therefore, LukeJr suggested a method by using existing anyone-can-spend type transactions (much like P2SH did) and implement the change via soft fork. Such soft forks work if only miner majority honor the new segwit rules.
The implementation uses a secondary 'witness' merkel root embedded in the coinbase transaction. The majority of miners now recognise this new witness merkle root and go fetch the witness data which is in a *separate data structure*. It is worth noting that any alteration made to the witness structure will alter the witness merkle root hash, subsequently having a flow on effect of changing the primary block hash itself.
In short, everything is linked/contained at an individual block level. A side effect was that it indirectly lead to a block size increase.. as signatures take up approximately 1/3 of the median transaction size.

The talent pool of people who work on cryptographic protocols is incredibly small. Usage vs funding is often ridiculously asymmetric. It took Heartbleed to occur before the giants of tech threw a bone to OpenSSL's tiny crew.
I believe Schnorr multisig is also very sensitive to implementation and initial participants setup.

Not to criticize your work, but doesn't the security of the system ultimately come down to your interpretation of it? It is secure as long as you say it is and no one has cracked it? Is the timelock similar to game copy protection schemes of the 90s?

"important for network security"
Do you mean for the good of decentralized censorship-resistant network resiliency? Hosting on Digital Ocean won't help. DO, Azure, EC2.. they all have plenty of full nodes within their IP spaces... and they are controlled under the potential banhammer of each respective company.
BTW a $10/month VM would probably be fine with regards to technical requirements.

Google would also have to sybill attack the network as nodes would reject the blocks due to network-adjusted time being off &gt; 2 hours. Either that, or Google honours network time and accepts the 2016-block difficulty adjustments after the quantum mining... which would likely push out the "2 seconds" statement a little.

There is no expectation for "gainz" on "pegged" coins.. therefore no speculative trading, which leaves real economic activity driving any trading imbalances? How much real activity is there on Lightning? Liquid is federated and used for a very specific function.
When I said the pegged coin may trade lower.. I meant due to perceived lower security profile of the pegged coin. SPV proofs can be faked in the short term, especially if the winfall motivates the miners enough.

Bitcoins being moved into a sidechain is fairly straight forward. The sidechain can implicitly trust the coins coming "from" Bitcoin.
Getting coins back out from the sidechain in a secure manner is the difficult part. It has been proposed for Bitcoin to use SPV proofs of the sidechain. However, amongst other issues, a sidechain is unlikely to ever be as secure as Bitcoin (especially since it won't have 100% of Bitcoin miners merge-mining it). A sidechain SPV proof is inferior to a Bitcoin SPV proof for example.
If a sidechain is not as secure as Bitcoin.. then a bitcoin leaving a sidechain can never be as "secure" as a bitcoin going in. Therefore, a 2-way peg cannot work as a sidechain coin will trade at a discount.. which begs the question.. is a sidechain coin really a "bitcoin"?
