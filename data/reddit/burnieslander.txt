Agreed. PayPal is agile AF, they could accept BTC payments tomorrow if they wanted to

Buying and selling crypto on an exchange like coinbase is hardly anonymous.

You mean those ones that have been getting hacked?

I would ask.. why the fuck are you giving your bits to microsoft?

Having been raised Catholic, I should let you know that Je-Zeus rose on the 3rd day.. soooo this doesn’t make sense

Agreed. In my own experience I've seen the Chinese gov issue a series of "decrees" (so to speak) that were aimed at protecting the intellectual property rights of Chinese digital media and gaming companies. The amount of content (e.g. hacked/modded versions of Super Mario Run) that disappeared from the internet was impressive.

It will be stable after it reaches tipping point AKA “goes mainstream”. That will only happen when demand reaches a critical mass where a significant portion of consumer spending is happening via Bitcoin AND goods and service providers start seeing evidence of consumers favoring providers accepting BTC as payment over those who do not. 
IMO we’ll see a form of punctuated evolution where things ebb and flow while generally trending upwards, but then experience explosive growth in a relatively short period of time. 
That said, at this point in history , “reliable” kinda depends on what you buy in at. I’m feeling really good about the 2K I bought at 7100.. Not so much about the 2K I bought at 13000

Interesting info but I’m not sure what the ultimate point is- are you making a case for decentralization or something else?

I’m trying to understand this whole situation.. are you saying that your BTC was converted to BCH without your authorization?

Hearing about price jumps on Reddit is so much more satisfying than checking Coinbase, especially when a good meme is involved.

Stop bullshitting people. None of what you say makes any sense. Financial system does not "date back to the Medici". Knights Templar were making loans 200 years before the Medici, and your Terminator analogy is nonsensical.

Because BTC held on Coinbase doesn’t actually belong to you. You don’t have private keys=you don’t own it.

I just use Coinbase to check price, nothing more ;-j
