I tell you what, you and everyone else agree on the price you will all collusively set and I give you my word I'll follow with the coins I hold.
Promise.

The document is an obvious fake, but that doesn't seem to matter to many in the community.

That's reddit for you.

Never forget that equilibrium is determined both by supply and demand, and that both are likely shifting at the moment, so the ceteris paribus argument of a decrease in supply leading to an increase in price is not appropriate.

The notion of the exchange being enforcement for clearing of the agreements is what you missed. Without this there is nothing to stop one part from reneging.

As long as the price of Bitcoin is positive and you have sufficiently recent technology doing your mining, then there is a positive expected value per hash, and therefore there is inherent value in mining.

Yea but these kind of policing and enforcement costs...for that many transactions a day...let's get real here...
Waiting for someone to come up with a tech fix to eliminate this problem though!

Well if it's that easy and viable I look forward to bringing my coins to your exchange :).

That's a moot point though given for any currency or near-currency to have a fixed value it would require an active central bank to maintain the peg. Bitcoin obviously doesn't have an active central bank.
