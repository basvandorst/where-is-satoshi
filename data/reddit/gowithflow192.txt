Interesting stats but what does market penetration mean? 97% of adults in rural areas do not own a phone.
Gov stats say 47% use in rural areas end of last year. I can't believe that more than doubled in a jumpeto 97% in less than a year:

Young people don't even take out wallets anymore. They don't need to. China developed at the right time and bypassed debit/credit card payment for the most part. Most people jumped straight from cash to wechat/alipay.
Chinese gov is having to clamp down on vendors who refuse cash because they don't want the hassle.
Having said that this is mostly in the big cities. In rural parts of China (half the country, it is nowhere near as widespread, many still don't have cellphones let alone pay electronically).
@_date: 2018-09-11 05:37:42
Not every village though and not everyone. Particularly the elderly (in comparison to the west).
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:55:39
Yes I am glad that Xi Jinping want to raise the rural out of poverty. What a powerhouse China will become even more in future years! Thanks for the info on the different situations with phones and wechat.

When a solid company or entity (maybe a trust) starts issuing its own paper (backed by promise like fiat but with no multiplier of owner bitcoin) this will be the real revolution.

There are hardly any programs paying out in crypto. Ironic considering it is supposed to increase trust. I think being outside the regular financial system actually decreases trust. 
Also gambling affiliate programs are always a hard sell for affiliates. Not many places they can still promote it.

The days of bitcoin for in-person transactions in a store are over. BCH is better for that and we all know it. Too many limitations with BTC. BTC is not for small change.
@_date: 2019-11-25 10:56:10
I think this is great. As someone who bought and sold (at a loss) bitcoin at 5 bucks, 200 bucks, I'm not in it for the long term. This is a great opportunity to buy on the dip. I managed to quickly get rid of some panic thought that entered my brain for a second. Don't panic and make the historical mistakes I did!
Now my question is, when to buy? Could it go down further? How long to wait to buy? Wait for a rebound of $300?
@_date: 2019-11-25 11:05:52
What does that mean? When someone sells bitcoin, the other side of the transaction buys it.
If they mean from their customer perspective, not sure if that proves anything. Are coinbase customers the oracle on the market?

The 'halvening' is no guarantee of a big price hike.
Price in a market represents aggregate opinion. If everyone thought the halvening would give a price hike then we would already be there (and maybe we are).
i.e. price today reflects expectation of price in the future more or less (there can be slight differences due to the time factor but they are minimal).
@_date: 2019-10-18 17:59:30
OK let me me more precise. Currency was only ever meant as a short term holder of value, at least that's all people expect.
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:20:20
A lot of bullet points look impressive but at least some of your points are really wide of the mark.
China does not face 'fiscal oblivion', in fact they prefer to play the long game and internally there is pressure not to cooperate with the US on the trade deal.
Also, Hong Kong is not 'fucked', whatever you mean by that.
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:22:08
But it's priced in already. Not just this halvening but also future ones.

But there is a higher chance of a bitcoin wallet being hacked than an alipay/wechat linked bank account (even if the latter, I'll bet there's legal protection).
@_date: 2019-10-11 15:20:24
Not really.
Alipay and wechat are linked to a Chinese bank account. Unlike bitcoin, your money isn't easily stolen.
The QR codes on alipay/wechat work much the same way as a mobile wallet.
But confirmation is almost instantaneous. With bitcoin you need to pay significantly more for fast confirmation.

Basic economics my friend
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:39:09
When will you buy or sell?
Buy 8.7
Sell 7.6

The idea is to have an emergency fund at least (instead of in bitcoin).
@_date: 2019-10-02 08:39:34
So is it turning the corner and up and up from now on?
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:21:02
It's a good point. Ink on paper can fade or wear out in a matter of months, the former even when stored in apparently 'safe' conditions.
@_date: 2019-10-11 09:11:36
If bitcoin or some other coin can become as easy and safe to use as wechat/alipay in China, then it will surpass cash.
In China, due to delayed development, they went straight from cash to wechat/alipay (QR codes linked to bank account) and never really embraced credit cards in a big way.
Youngsters don't even bother with a wallet. They just take their phone with them when they go out.
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:41:50
That last part about inflation, I mean all currencies inflate, they are not supposed to be holders of value.
I think bitcoin is an asset, a holder of value, that like gold is not as liquid as cash in my hand but nevertheless can still be used to transact with.
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:47:55
Nothing is guaranteed to go up.
Current price reflects future price expectation.
If the whole market believed the price would eventually go up, then the price today would reflect that.
Could be the long term stable value is 100 bucks for all we know.
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:19:24
Interesting from that chart, there is no correlation between halvening dates and price. But the general trend over the years is up.
Too many people around here who think that 'the halvening'=instant money.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:05:44
The problem is it is very easy for men to get carried away on hair-brained money making ideas.
They think that bitcoin is the latest one.
There's no convincing them, try to keep it quiet in future.
Also, there's no guarantee of anything, don't put everything into it.

I was going to mention his videos, but you already saw them. Great guy.
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:17:41
He said in his videos what I remember is that almost everyone has to have some kind of side income in order to survive.
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:49:20
Can’t just blame the banks. Irresponsible people who took on too much debt they couldn’t afford to service for the long terms are just as responsible. It’s so easy to just ‘blame the bankers’. This widely held viewpoint is symptomatic of people finding solace in being the victim which is widespread in western society sadly.
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:21:40
Haha. Well it remains to be seen if bitcoin will remain the primary crypto currency like the usd is to fiat. Could be that ethereum trumps it one day, for example.
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:09:52
The article headline is misleading. She didn’t say bitcoin, she said crypto currencies in general and the tech behind them.
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:23:41
Predatory? Nobody forced at gunpoint someone signing up for a mortgage they would never be able to afford.
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:41:26
I think she was talking more about distributed ledger and transparency. Banks are not going to use bitcoin to assist with settlement.
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:56:24
Well simply have to agree to disagree. This is a very polarized debate, politics I suppose. But, trust me, I’m not trolling. We will probably never agree on this but that doesn’t make it trolling.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:58:07
Indeed the government is as much to blame. They should never have bailed the banks out. If you look at Iceland they did not bail out. The result was a stronger financial system and people still eventually got most of their money back. They are all stronger for it.

Anyone know any others? I mean non sexual services.

Strange, I always thought that foreign exchange (I hate that term 'forex') was the only unregulated financial market.
I wonder how it is easily regulated when there is no central exchange, no central registry etc. Derivatives are a different bag though.
