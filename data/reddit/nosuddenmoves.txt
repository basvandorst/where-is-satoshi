I just sent 100k in us dollars to the prince of kenya so the bank will release his 100 billion.  No way I'm going to spend the 20 million dollars he promised me on bitcoin now. Thanks for the warning kenya!

Seems like all anyone focuses on is the problems...
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:54:56
That would require a real investigation, not a coverup.

If it's good news does this mean its actually bad for bitcoin?

MK is a sociopath.  "Hackers" and "Transaction Maliability" talk is to fool the ignorant masses.  He's ready to launder the coins he did get away with on his new servers and no one will stop him.  All his twitter bs is just to rub it in so he can get off after he robs you. I'm sure Karpeles is an active member of r/bitcoin. He's most likely fapping to this thread right now and using his sock accounts to troll. He has the time.

So you contributed nothing to bitcoin and you didn't get rich quick in under a year and now you're divesting? Fuck off. I'm saving this post so I can repost it in a year and everyone can laugh at you.
I only wish you had slunk away silently rather than choosing to spread your ignorance before you left.
r/buttcoin calls you.

I think you meant a concentrated dose of 180,000 satoshis.  Do you even bitcoin?

He always blames someone else for his failures too.

Bitcoin may not be for you, you might want to check out doge.

So far my favorite part is when her boss said that they're trying to change but things at the fed move slow, like the titanic.

Andreas needs some sleep, look at the bags under those eyes.

what i find amazing is that r/bitcoin has become sentient and u/tetondon can communicate with it.
@_date: 2014-09-10 21:17:55
I hope it's better than the [bitcoin burning man camp](
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:18:40
Can we please just call them the fraudulent bitcoin foundation from now on?

I ordered the first day and still waiting on mine. How did you get yours so fast?
@_date: 2014-10-02 03:03:24
Who exactly are you even addressing? If anything complain about the recent deluge of circle jerk shill articles and you might get my upvotes.

He has no sense of shame, merely an inflated self value with no substance to back it up.

It's people like shooter and not the bitcoin foundation that will eventually send bitcoin to the moon.

If I hear he "lost" the coins again I'm going to throw up. Right now karpeles and the bitcoin foundation are dumping gox coins for fiat on btc-e nonstop.  Roget Ver is full of shit about stopping hackers, he backed karpeles and to this day I've never heard him say anything about a gox reward. All this bs is just a well played smokescreen.
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:54:04
Duh, Bitcoin is a pump and dump scheme.  Having bought some to hodl at every price drop has taught me this. I fell for it every time and will probably continue to fall for it until bitcoin goes to zero and I can just own the entire network that's left for nothing.

who wouldn't expect jigsaw to come through with the bits? at least op survived and overcame his inner flaws/fears thus gaining a new perspective and appreciation of life.

I heard he actually has to steal from someone to maintain an erection, otherwise it shrinks back to an innie.

The government agencies that run tor don't recommend it because they can't monitor your activities as easily on the nodes they possess.

It would take a CIA operation in conjunction with the FBI, INTERPOL and big banks, not gonna happen.

And how many houses could I have invested in if I didn't put all the money into that one? what happens when the value of the house drops out and the market goes bad? There are some rewards but most investors don't think it's worth the risk when the bank can take most of it for you and you can put more of your own money somewhere else important.

People who work in the art industry don't even keep 30% portfolio in art, dude was just making some shit up.  Also the art world can get really dirty with fakes, war crimes, money laundering, theft etc.  At the high end art is a thrill investment for the super rich that probably doesn't even equal 1% of what they actually own. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:00:47
the Tesla isn't as bad as you think after gas savings and a decent resale value, you could do a lot worse throwing money around on a vehicle.  the art idea is so dumb though.
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:06:17
I occasionally buy things at auctions and repo'd estates to resell or hodl and there is no end to $5k-20K art pieces with receipts that go for less than $1k sometimes tens of dollars.  Gold and silver coins sell ABOVE value at the same auctions due to the demand, I've never seen them go for a reasonable price.  Sometimes the art and the amount spent on it is so audacious it makes me wonder what the people did for a living and how they came across money in the first place before they lost it.
