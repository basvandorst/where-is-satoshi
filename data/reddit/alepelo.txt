Yes, this is indeed a bubble popping. Just look at the chart and compare it too other bubbles

It means to bet against the price of bitcoin. I will make money if bitcoin goes down. It is very useful if you want to keep the value of your assets constant, for example in the case of Soy or Corn futures. But it is also used for speculative purposes, for example, if you believe BTC is a bubble, you will look for ways to short BTC in order to profit massively when it pops, some people did exactly that with the real state market bubble.

Yeap, sounds about the right valuation for a Bitcoin. It is so fun to see all you guys going bankrupt ������

A little known fact about Isaac Newton is that he lost $2.72 million USD in today's money due to speculation in The South Sea Company stock in the 1720s.  As a result of this crisis, he stated "I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people."

Yeah, because bitcoin is not investing, it's speculation.

To the MOON!!!!! Just HODL!... Jesus fucking Christ... I remember so many hodlers repeating like parrots... Yeah, it will go to 100K by the end of the year!.... well, welcome to reality. The bubble just burst.

Not only that, there is no underlying value behind it. This is exactly the same case as with any other craze. You really believe this growth will continue forever?

$500? That is a lot!

Yeah, now it is entering a bearish trend. I believe BTC will be around 200 USD by the end of 2017.

It's regression to the mean. Bitcoin is being traded very much like a penny stock, right now the price is being pumped, eventually it will be dumped and go back to 2013 levels.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:27:29
I don't think it will be worth zero, however, the values we are seeing are just crazy, bitcoin resembles the behaviour of a penny stock pump and dump scheme. I would say 250 dollars by the end of the year. But who knows, no one has a crystal ball.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:20:28
strong? or pumped? A very dangerous difference.

Historically all governments control their currency, eventually they will declare Bitcoin illegal as part of their war against terrorism and drugs money laundry. They may not be able to crack down on the network itself, but they will definitively go for the exchanges and prevent any conversion from BTC to fiat.

Come on, one bitcoin will be worth millions of dollars and you will not have to work ever again in your life! 
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:31:47
I think the price is going back to where it should be, around 250 dollars. The bubble is popping. Time to short BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:17:52
As I said, no one has the crystal ball, time will tell.
