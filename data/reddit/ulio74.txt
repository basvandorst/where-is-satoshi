Only that it doesn't have anything to do with money laundering.  
But more about TAX and Control.

If you ask me, it's more than Cash alone. In my country ( Western Europe ) we have a lot of digital surveillance all around the place. In fact the authorities can follow me from the minute I leave my home to where I go.  Every vehicle that enters my city is scanned. You also get scanned the minute you get on the highway and where you get off again.
If you go by public transport you must get a card that can be tracked. Even if it's an anonymous card. Because you will have to upgrade the card in one or another way. And also if you pay with cash, the ticket machine has a camera that takes a picture of your face. Everywhere you go there are camera's. When you're at the gates to go to the public transport, you scan your card and a camera is recording you scanning. It's  easy to connect your card number to your face. And your face is scanned everywhere, if you've ever used an ATM, they have your face. Everything you do can be recorded/ tracked these days. Unless you live in remote area's.
To make it even more fun, most of those camera's are controlled by some soft of AI with face recognition and best of all, " action recognition " In some area's if you make certain gestures the AI will send a police unit at you to see what you're doing.
My country has quietly turned into a surveillance state and their argument is for the safety of peoples. It is a dangerous development. I mean you just have to trust they don't use that data in a bad way or that they don't get hacked. I don't trust things I can't control.

Yeah, well that is because most results are from American based websites because Americans have a Libertarian party. So the word is associated because Americans use it a lot in that context. 
That is the reason why I provided a link to a **dictionary** so you can look up the meaning of the word. Not how it's widely used / abused.

I'm not talking about Libertarian as in political view. For me all political views are just nonsense anyway.I'm talking about Libertarian as in **Freedom.**
Bitcoin was created because of the financial theft we see everyday. If you don't know what I mean than just look it up and try to understand how fiat money works. And better yet, find out who "OWNS" all our money and why we all have debts. Even when you think you don't have debts.
Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of Bitcoin died a long time ago!  By the way.. But the idea still lives among some peoples like my self. It's not without a reason that "no one" knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is.

He pays in Euro's ;)
So maybe he did mean a political view, and maybe not. 
Anyway, at the end of the day it's all about context.
At least I know that  a word can have different meanings on different continents.

I agree, I didn't know that there was a strong political association with Libertarians in the US. And I also don't like that political association with Bitcoin either because that's far from the truth. But nonetheless I've learned a lot again. I thank you for this enlightening discussion!

Maybe Libertarianism is a political philosophy to your understanding but the word Libertarian doesn't have to mean something political per se. I think the misconception here is that you think I mean political views. But I don't mean politics. 
I'm not American, so maybe that's the reason why you think Libertarian only means a political view or party. 
For me Liber = Free, Libertarian = Someone who loves to be free

What he's talking about is the "real" bitcoin vision. Or better said the entire reason Bitcoin exists in the first place.
