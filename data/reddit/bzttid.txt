No, of course not. No one has ever even claimed that is a thing. Stop being intentionally dumb.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:23:12
not that it matters
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:41:22
Guess so. Just think it's important to mention that there are girls on (a) the internet and (b) the crypto community.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:47:56
I disagree, he is implying it. Not that it matters, because you'll never agree on that fact.
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:44:08
But.. why? Wouldn't it make more sense to just *buy* some? You're losing money on power
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:55:01


 
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:23:56
but women can choose to grow beards, they could just take testosterone. And he was talking about the Bill Nye segment. Have you seen the Bill Nye segment? It's talking about transgender people.
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:40:08
Still means you made a good amount tho
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:20:32
How much did you invest originally? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:59:00


I see you've never taken a science class.


No one thinks it's your decision. Who the *fuck* would *choose* to be something that a huge majority of people *hate*? It's nonsensical to think that anyone would choose to *be* transgender/intersex. Most people just wish that they were normal.
Bill Nye (though his segment is cringy as fuck) isn't wrong- gender identity/transgender people are a real thing based in biological origin. 
Here, don't argue with me, argue with Harvard:


with transgender people being about .6% of society and LGB people being &lt;3%, why.. do you care? What sort of issues do you have that this makes you want to *vomit*? 
If anyone is a freak of nature, it's probably people like you who care waaaayy too much about other people's lives.
Also, that youtube video you posted is from a channel that is *legit* nuts. Like Alex Jones nuts. Like for anyone else wondering how fucking off the deep end nuts it is check it out for funsies here:

Forking the code means you've created your own copy, and is essentially meaningless. Forking the chain, afaik, means you've created your own block chain and all the transactions have been copied over. You can have all of the code for Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean you have a functioning copy of Bitcoin.   
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:41:55
There isn't any, really outside the "ohhh we know how much money you have!!!" People are just excessively paranoid.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:57:49
Did you just try to prove your racism with the scientific method? And beyond that, that really *isn't* literally the scientific method you fucking dingus.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:09:51




Right, because some scammers are Indian. Have you seen "The Good Place"? That show literally makes fun of white people scammers. We laugh because it's true. Cause people in general scam other people.


So they obviously don't like scammers.


You're narrowing your context from "scammers are Indian" to "most phone scams are Indian". I think even you know you're wrong.


You're the one who doesn't know what the scientific method is. Maybe you need to grow up, cause I learned that shit in 6th grade so you clearly aren't at that level yet.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:48:06
Congrats, you were writing C++ and Java like every other nerdy 16 year old.  What you did back coding-wise then is irrelevant, I promise you that you did some stupid shit that the entire internet could flame you for, and you wouldn't deserve it. That was the point of my comment.
Did she do something wrong? Probably. She should have claimed involvement rather than responsibility, I'm not *denying* that what happened here wasn't great. But if you think this was entirely her fault and she wasn't taken advantage of then you're a moron. She does not deserve the brunt force of the entire internet shitting on her. She literally didn't steal anything- she was offered to work on a project then given full credit for it for the sake of **marketing** and **$$$ for a company**. That's fucked up, and that's the real issue here, but instead people are like "YO FUCK THOSE LADY INDIAN DEVELOPERS RITE". One of the top comments when I first showed up was basically saying that all Indian women developers steal code, and the last thing us software developers need is more issues with sexism.
I'm saying that the issue here is that a corporation attempted to use race and gender as a way to gain $$$. Fuck that, that's what we should be focusing on. Not creating a hate fueled racism thread.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:37:00
5$ says you did stupid shit when you were 16 too, some of us were just lucky not to have the internet so we didn't have 15000 neckbeards screaming in our faces about how the reason we suck is that we're women and not because we're Young and make mistakes and were taken advantage of by a big corporation.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:25:14


Oh hey, there's that gaslighting I was talking about.


Then why don't you explain the pertinence of the concept if I need to learn it so bad? I would *love* to hear your logic.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:37:53
80%? Where are you pulling that statistic from?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:27:57
No, it's women's fault because women are evil, duh. This one time when I was 16 this girl rejected me when I asked her to the school dance because she said I was "fugly" and that just proves that all women are evil and I've hated them ever since. Christina you bitch!
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:30:40
People are doing it with race and gender, so why not add age to this discrimination blend too!
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:01:11
I know, but that doesn't stop the fact that racism needs to be called out and shown to be completely unreasonable to all the eyes that are watching.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:31:23
Ohhh nooo imagine your poor ego. Seriously? This is why you're upset? Because it hurts your feelings? Jfc
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:41:23
Just get to your low iq point, dude.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:02:27
How.. is this reality? Do you have quantifiable data of the ethnicity of all scammers? Or are you just doing the *extremely scientific* thing of going entirely off your own bias?
You'd make such a good anthropologist. /s
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:02:48
Literally not the scientific method.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:32:03
Completely misrepresented or misunderstood what I said, but alright.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:10:26
So white people don't do phone scams? Like every single call saying I win a free cruise has been a white (sounding) lady.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:59:15
American isn't a race, can't be racist by calling Americans racist. (And sidenote: I am american)
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:25:24
If you actually think this is a logical way of thinking then you belong in Fuck
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:05:35
And amazingly, there's a lot of scammers of various ethnicities here, too. Hell, how many nerdy white dudes have stolen or scammed Bitcoin? It's like y'all being racist are screaming at Indian people for being scammers when there's like 40 billion shitcoins trying to con you, yet the only scammers are clearly Indian people. Jfc
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:05:27
Right? Like so many Kickstarter "games" are bullshit. Just blows my mind that somehow all of a sudden all scammers are Indian in people's mind.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:35:01
Where did you do your research? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:45:11


But you didn't say "there are a lot of x scammers", you said:




@_date: 2018-02-05 16:29:22
Can take a small amount of time to catch them though. If you're constantly refreshing (as I imagine a lot of people would be) you may see it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:37:30
Literally no. Because genetically they have black hair.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:04:46


I mean, white supremacy was the only real next step in this conversation for you. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:11:10
\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;**do background research**&lt;&lt;&lt;
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:03:52
First, telemarketers aren't scammers. Second, you can't just give examples and say "see?!? All scammers are Indian!!"
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:18:50
I think it's ultimately this attitude that will kill Bitcoin. It's not the currency itself that sucks, it's just so many of the people.
I've been involved in crypto since 2012 and I've seen it go from nerdy people/people who hate banks/people who want change in the way we transact with money, to ultra bro-ish wannabe "investors" who act like they know what they're talking about because they read a wikiHow on investing but have no fucking idea what they're doing. The community around crypto fucking sucks, and it drives people away faster than any price dip.
It's so fucking pompous to be like "Well you shouldn't have invested more than you could handle ��" to someone who is like "this sucks, I lost money". Y'all were screaming "BUY BUY BUY" and "MILLION DOLLAR BTC!!!" in December and a lot of people bought into the hype. Now you're shaming them for that?
You want adopters? Stop being dicks. Bitcoin isn't an investment platform, it's a new currency. Treating it solely like an investment, HODL-ing, and not using it to buy and sell goods is what will kill it. The greed and want to "get rich quick" will kill it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:05:13


I wouldn't exactly call this a shocking revelation, though. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:17:48
What a weird defense for racism. 
The dude is saying that a large amount of scammers are Indian. Hes also responding to a super racist comment against Indians. Yeah, it's his experience, and that's exactly the problem and stupidity of racism. "A lot of people with a certain color skin have done a bad thing to me, so all people with that color skin must be bad (despite the reality that many people of many skin colors do the same shitty thing).". He's encountered *plenty* of scams done by white people (he's part of the crypto community, I mean, come on) yet he's saying the only scams he's encountered are indian people? Come on.
Im a sjw for calling out racism? Lol, fuck off you gaslighting douche. I bet you invested in bitconnect.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:06:23
Oh, then totally with you. It's a huge issue.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:46:07
I'm not, but also imagine being a software company and using a 16 year old as a marketing ploy to make your app popular.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:40:31
You're so desperate for an answer, I can only assume that this will lead to more of you spewing racist nonsense.
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:10:27
I've been involved in bitcoin since 2011, so..
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:35:26


As a trans person this is how I'll refer to my transition from now on.
