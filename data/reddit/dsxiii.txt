So sell all crypto? Buy on cards for rewards points, then pay it off? Rinse and repeat?

I'm a little confused. No fees will be great, but is it strictly for investment? I don't see anywhere that you'll be able to spend it.

From what I remember, I think it went really high really fast as it got closer and closer and then dropped shortly after, before trending upwards steadily over time and going even higher. So like up down up up. This is not professional advice.

This looks great! I've always hated the stream delays on twitch and can't wait to give this a shot.

Cloudbet pays out really fast! They also offer a deposit bonus, which I don't believe Nitrogen does. I also use directbet.eu for quick single bets because the bet is immediate wihout needing for deposits to clear first.

Rewards though. Like buying w/ a small discount.

I'm sure it's been said here before, but beyond hodling people should also set up recurring buys at amounts they're comfortable with. Just set it up and let it work. It beats the nearly nonexistant interest that banks pay you while hodling your cash.

That you're supposed to sell it all everytime the value goes up.

Damn, I always wondered how many Kia Sorentos I could have bought. The regret is real.

This should be the hodler's anthem.
