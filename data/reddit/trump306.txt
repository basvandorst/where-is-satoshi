Because they're not socialist. It's mostly made of capitalist economies with social programs and policies. Scandinavian countries are not seizing the means of production like Venezuela is or has.
Also I wouldn't say Scandinavia is "thriving" a lot of countries like Sweden have gone backwards, I wouldn't live in a city like Malmo if you paid me...

Never insulted him, his record shows incompetence, someone who only put the country backwards. So yeah you're salty. I'm neutral really...

Socialism has never worked man, throughout history, it's failed at every step. Just from the Soviet Union and Communist China alone, socialism has killed 138 million people through starvation and regimes.
Try and spin it how you want, but it's fundamentally never worked and never will. I'm sorry if that offends you or anyone else, but facts are facts.
The very essence of socialism is the collection and centralisation of power, so of course that power will be abused, leading always to Authoritarianism. It's human nature.
History is repeating itself

I can: socialism.

I could care less what the fake news media think, they are left leaning, if not socialists themselves, at the very least cultural marxists. So I've done the research on my own, indeed these regimes are authoritarian socialist regimes, usually marxist regimes, or Stalinist regimes. I came to this conclusion on my own.

I think you're deluded if you don't realise this is what socialism is really like...
Socialism has killed more people than anything else ever in recorded history.
I will concede and say capitalism isn't perfect, but nothing really is... 
It's merely best to compare the living standards of almost any western capitalist country, compared to socialist countries throughout history.

I'm just telling you what he said on his AMA. I'd link it but it's on T_D and people get triggered if you link to that sub.

Obama wasn't a socialist. He was just incompetent.

Nope, the very essence of capitalism is the free market, as in competition. Rather than centralising wealth in one business owned by the state, it is spread amongst multiple companies and businesses.
The problem with countries like the United States is that Governments have put their tentacles out and created "Reserve Banks" or "National Banks" which control and centralise the currency. Hence it is the antithesis of capitalism, the definition of capitalism is "an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state." The state centralising the currency means they can essentially own part of and control the flow of trade and industry.
The state and Governments have encroached on capitalism when really private banks/companies purchase in return for what they value and decentralised currencies such as Bitcoin would rule the free market. Hell, even trading and bartering is part of the capitalist system.
Problem isn't capitalism, the problem is reserve banks, centralised currencies and federal reserves.
Furthermore, in the U.S people keep to their partisan politics and keep electing certain officials to seats where they continue to abuse power and accumulate wealth in return for favors and donations. Capitalism isn't inherently the problem in such a case, the problem is the people who keep electing officials who are willing to sell out their country.

They are probably well fed and receive an inflated pay.

Population of the United States of America (estimated): 323.1 million
Population of Sweden (estimated): 9.908 million
So the USA has 32x the population, with guns rampant everywhere, yet it only has 4x the murder rate of Sweden (if your stats are correct). Not bad really... Considering the distribution of the population, that's actually lower than you'd expect.

I remember this Venezuelan guy doing a AMA and he said for people to send him crypto like Ethereum cause it was his only way of having money for food to eat. He also described people playing Runescape and selling gold in order to just get by.

Arguable. [According to the HDI, the U.S is currently ranked higher than Sweden.](
