He dreamed big and was able to admit his losses. So few individuals can actually be honest about their successes AND failures. I commend him for being true to himself and merit you for illuminating the community. Keep your head up

sent you some bitcoin directly from my wallet. May I please have a copy of your art?
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:55:06
I've only just started getting into Bitcoin. It's not that prevalent here in London or England for that matter but we're in an bitcoin race with New York and I only hope that the adoption spreads. It's great to see the blockchain being utilized for purposes such as art and the suchlike. It is literally connecting people in a way that most of us cannot even fathom. 
Kind Regards,
Frank Alphonse

To be perfectly honest, I have never held any Bitcoins on any major exchanges such as Bitstamp or Bitfinex, but to my knowledge CEX.IO is actually based back here in London with solid volume trade in the US, Europe and South America.  Bittrex and Yobit are prime examples of exchanges which like to boost emerging altcoins through Initial coin offerings which in itself is a risk as the majority of them are created for the sheer purpose of pumping and dumping. 
It is how an exchange stores and diversifies their holdings, the way they market themselves (any indication of additional services such as shares or discounts are red flags) and how loyal their employees are that determines how solvent they are. In an ideal world, you'd like to think that most exchanges are run by professional people but it is not the first time we have seen an exchange become the victim of embezzlement and all it takes is one insider to make the house of cards fall. 
If you have to trade on an exchange, as soon as you have closed your positions, withdraw your coins back to your cold wallet as there are no excuses for leaving your coins on there as sitting ducks. Until you know any more information about who works there or what's behind their model, stay clear.

I think they're long gone by now but this protocol needs to be exercised more. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

that's kind of you :)

I'm glad there are people who don't hide behind the shadows. I'm sure there are plenty more who have made mistakes but are too afraid to come forward or refuse to swallow their pride. That's why these examples are vital for the community. I know they'll find their worth back to you.

Do Circle and Coinbase ask you for full verification? I only ask because I use Uphold which allows you to withdraw to your bank account from the respective country you apply from.

I have nobody to blame but myself. From its inception, there have been a library of resources both online and hardbook that document all the positive and negative characteristics of Bitcoin. I was too lazy to educate myself on what precautions should be taken but now I have the vigilance to protect myself and others.

People wouldn't be willing to come up with elaborate schemes if they didn't think the coins were worth something. 
Trying to build my stash is more expensive than it was back then but I have learnt that holding your hands out under faucets and playing High Yield Investment programmes are susceptible to greed. 
For the everyday man, they must be EARNT by hard work but most importantly, as the end of the year has shown us, patience also rewards those who sow their seeds organically.

I joined cloudminr.io two years ago and naievly deposited 14 BTC there as my eyes lit at the prospect of earning 1 BTC a week. Sadly, I didn't do my homework and If I had joined at the conception of the ponzi I might have been lucky to ROI with other people's deposits. A month later, they collapsed the website and made an announcement that they had been hacked.
 It only took a week before they put the entire database up for sale for a measly BTC which perfectly summarizes the lengths people will go to to misappropriate and the judge of characters that make it uncomfortable for those looking from the outside in the cryptocurrency microcosm. 
 Hashes have a very short life expectancy and the amount you would have to purchase to accommodate the rate difficulty could be used to purchase BTC directly. Don't fund a cloud miner's account to fund their account...I hope you learn from my mistake.

You're absolutely right. I should know better as an Englishman lol

To my understanding, the community is categorized between Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Unlimited proposes a hard fork to increase the current blocksize which may or may not have implications on the functionality of the network.  
On the contrary, Bitcoin Core suggests Segwit as an alternative which essentially increases the blocksize with an accounting trick that doesn't count part of the data against it AND without having to create two chains on which coins can be spent.
Please pardon me for me waffling. I hope that either of the links can provide you with some closure.

Uphold does require photo ID, your bank details and proof of address. Frustratingly, it doesn't offer UK bank transfers for depositing on the platform anymore. 
However, if you transfer your Bitcoins to your uphold address, you can transfer them to your GBP card. The fee is 0.75% for the conversion so PROVIDED you're willing to accept that much windfall, you can then transfer from your GBP card to your bank account which is free of charge taking between one to three days. 
In short, depositing and withdrawing to and from platforms will always incur some kind of fee but as far as liquidity is concerned, uphold is the one that works for me as a Brit.

I personally think that both teams should reach a consensus as attempting to centralize the network by allowing people to vote via nodes will only end in tears. I imagine if the block tries to fill more transactions than it can accommodate they will not be processed properly. If the network is fractured, it may create more work for the miners which eventually will become frustrated and ultimately could compromise the value we have accumulated over time. 
It's a very extreme example but I believe that whether we work towards a temporary (CORE) or permanent (UL) increase, developers will want their solutions to be rolled out in anticipation for the next halving and I am confident that it will not take four years for this to materialize.

You're good people for giving them a heads up and reinforcing it here. Some of the best advice we have is practically buried.

This will not distract developing countries and people who have HODL'd to see it reach its peak. Be like Bill

I have lost bitcoins to cloudmining/HYIPs, selling and rebuying at higher prices during Mike hearn's exit and Bitmain gate (Asic boost), trying to accumulate more and failing miserably by catching dips and selling tops wayyy off and investing in ICOs. I can honestly say in these last three years the only thing more depressing than seeing blood on the streets is the ghost of the coins I worked for to purchase. Please don't sell them unless you need them for an emergency
