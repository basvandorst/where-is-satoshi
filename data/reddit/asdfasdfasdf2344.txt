Well the $100 note is the hardest note to counterfeit with all the security measures. So if you can counterfeit the $100 with near perfect perfection then counterfeiting a $20 or $50 should be super simple.

True but eventually the community would suspect something is fishy going on.
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:38:51
how many people have they scammed?

I'm sure those types will be weeded out since society in general is against exploitation of children, even in underground communities like TOR. I know it exists on TOR services but I haven't seen it myself. If anything, it is a very fringe group of people overall even in TOR.


A solution could be developed to prevent this from happening. My guess is so sort of robust feedback engine. The more feedback a person has the more likely they are to be legit.
Even if that is not the case, some sort of solution will be developed by the community.

and the irony of the situation is just imagine how many Bolivians are reading this article and saying, "what is bitcoin?"
Often times trying to ban something actually has the reverse effect.

Couldn't someone just copycat the site and put it on tor?
@_date: 2014-06-11 05:57:23
and vending machines for sure

Almost a laughable statistic but I guess I'll read the report on it.

You can use it to buy drugs on tor black markets.

How many? Statistics are important here.

Well on the bright side, if bitcoin doesn't go anywhere you can just default on the debt and keep the bitcoins.

and scammers, definitely reverse payment scammers for sure!

[Wait until you read this](
Basically, the article is saying that foreign governments might be printing super high quality fake $100 bills. These notes are so good that only a highly trained person can detect them. Right now it seems the notes are just being used for basic simple corruption but they could also be used for economic warfare. If they wanted to, they could flood the world with these notes and almost everyone (except the secret service) would have no idea on how to detect real from fake. Then simple supply and demand takes place as the value of USD plummets.

Site seems to be down even if you click on it through the google ad 
@_date: 2014-06-20 07:22:37
They probably only get charged for one click since same IP.
@_date: 2014-06-20 05:05:41
Good enough for me!
@_date: 2014-06-21 03:32:25
but if you ask adsense that technically can't happen because your competitors would be click spamming you all day long...
