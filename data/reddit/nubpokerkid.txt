Yes, hard to think straight when you tilt.

It is very obvious that you need to pay taxes on your profits. You need to pay taxes of ANY income that you earn except if it is tax exempt. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:08:12
Probably because of lack of proper tech in the exchange and lots of internal transaction and non batching of transactions. Unlike coinbase there's no concept of sending within the network.

Daily volume BTC in the last 24 hours on koinex - 200, zebpay - 300, GDAX - 19000. How is this 17%?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:24:58
lol, TA :D
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:46:44
Bitcoin China LMAO :D
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:51:04
Umm so why doesn't everyone do this? That guy just got away with including 1 transaction and getting 12.5 btc as reward for it?

Congrats on spending a futuristic asset to buy a puppy that must've been bred and thus supports a shitty industry of breeding dogs for human pleasure. There are plenty of dogs out there who need humans and who wouldn't "cost" this much.

Is it a single transaction that you sent from a wallet or is the transaction sent from an exchange? If it’s sent from an exchange I don’t think you can do anything since they’ve decided fees. 
In case you sent it from a wallet I’ve read that there are sites from where you can bump your transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:06:47
Also koinex.

What does "SPV mined" mean?
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:00:58
Same here. A big hunch that the price is going to tank. But not able to pull the trigger on selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:49:13
Pray for you dude. Hopefully this is just a bad Phase. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:57:31
Sorry. when you buy from a dealer, you support the dealer and his practices. If no one was buying there wouldn't be this industry. Pretending to nice and caring and giving no regard to how you got there, is hypocrisy at best. Feel free to hold different opinions though. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:54:35
The mempool is really clogged right now and if you used anything less than 900 sat/byte as fees its not going to get picked up.

i can't think why any European bank or American bank would let me open a bank account there without me studying or working in that country.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:23:48
Lmao.

I totally feel you. I think people don’t give him enough credit when they say he lost his private keys. Excuse me, he fucking invented the whole thing and that’s what you think? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:16:38
To be able to buy at dips. Zebpay doesn’t fluctuate with real prices, fast enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:04:40
It’s very disheartening to see that exchanges in India are a joke. 10 percent premium and 20 btc trading volumes a day. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:08:05
good point. going to delete this. the shop is useful. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:02:41
Asking a friend would be quite problematic because of all the tax issues. Plus I would have to pay him somehow. 
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:34:08
Should probably just leave this and check back in 2 years. This is so fucked up.

Biggest exchange in India does 50 btc per day trade volume :P
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:49:33
Zebpay probably has the highest fees (trading, withdrawal) amongst the top 50 exchanges in the world. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:38:15
Meanwhile crypto has robbed people anywhere between 60-90%. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:09:28
Any experience in this?
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:14:57
Saw that figure 2.x on zebpay and realized I had 33 rs in my account. FML. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:10:20
yeah they all fucking do this whenever they can.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:24:15
I'm in charge of my destiny. I'm important. I matter. There is no such thing as manipulation. /s
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:17:44
Yes, what did it say?
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:53:07
Yeah the other cryptos are so much full of shit except a few. Everyone has forgotten what crypto currencies are all about and are chasing stupid gains from penny coins or buying centralized shitcoins which are premined and a get rich scheme for founders. 
It's alright, there would be a cleanse and people would flock to bitcoin when it's too late and then again post regretful posts of not buying in when it was sub 10k. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:17:24
Hence the question.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:28:30
This is amazing.
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:23:05
It’s cool man. It’ll always be like this. People who sell now would think why didn’t they hold it till it went to 200k. It’s always gamble and hindsight is 20/20. If you had fun while doing it there’s nothing you have to regret about :)
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:49:48
You need to buy BNB first so that you don't get dust and are able to buy and sell full coins. Then the difference has to be greater than .1% for it to make a profit because of fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:17:30
You need a pan card for all the online exchanges. 
You can buy on localbitcoins if you want to buy with cash. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:40:12
Probably some exchange consolidating. It's full of 100 sat/byte transactions. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:35:48
Can you tell me how to get initiated into looking at charts and blocks and prices? TIA. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:14:30
Yes, why not. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:19:45
of course you would not be able to get away without paying taxes. when you exchange it for anything you materialize it for profit and need to pay taxes whether in fiat or bitcoin. Think.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:39:12
I am not from the US.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:37:47
Seems legit. I see people who’ve done 100+ or 1000+ trades so it should be legit. Also localbitcoins has an escrow service as well to facilitate transaction. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:09:25
This is already illegal. Bitcoin is not legal tender in India so you cannot pay or receive btc against services.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:28:03
RBI LOGIC: Let's create FUD every 2 months and fill our bags. I think they are smarter than they let go. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:26:48
Come on man it's NOT FUD. /s
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:11:58
And the govt wants to release it's own coin while having no clue about what bitcoin stands for. What are you Venezuela? They've been trying to understand this technology for 1.5 years now and they come up with "We will create our own coin" LMAO. Dear government, you already have FIAT. Why do you need a coin?
Anyway, Indian govt is hopeless.
