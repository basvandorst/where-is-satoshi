I'm really sorry to hear that you're having such a rough time getting verified. Please PM me your support ticket number and I'll make sure that we're doing everything we can to help get this resolved. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:32:40
Sorry we didn't get back to you yet. Our client engagement team is slammed. Your BTC will probably be sent very soon (within 24 hrs from when you requested your withdrawal). 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:28:23
Withdrawals are processing normally. As a protection measure, 24 hr holds are sometimes placed on withdrawals which are deemed higher risk. If your withdrawal was held for this reason, it should be sent automatically within 24 hrs of the time requested. Apologies for the inconvenience. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:22:38
The 24 hr hold is a result of you attempting to send to a brand new address plus other risk factors. You should be fine if you send to an older address.

Kraken should work great for you. We offer CAD trading and funding (Interac or EFT) to Canadians. Let us know if you have questions or need any help at all.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:07:35
Kraken offers totally fair market conditions. If any frontrunning was happening, quants would certainly be digging up evidence and voicing substantive complaints.
As suggested elsewhere, you may be suffering from a confirmation bias, trading on stale order book data, and mischaracterizing the behaviour of sophisticated trading bots which are playing by the rules.
If you have any questions about your trades, please feel free to get in touch with us directly via our support channel at 
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:14:51
Interac deposit fees for Kraken and Quadriga are the same at 1.5% ($5 min). Cavirtex charges at least 2.5% ($25 on the max deposit amount of $1,000). With Kraken your Interac deposits are credited immediately so you can start trading right away. EFT deposits and withdrawals (takes 3-5 days) are free with Quadriga right now. Cavirtex charges a flat $7.5 for deposits, $10 for withdrawals. Kraken charges 1.5% for deposits, 1% for withdrawals (max $75).
Kraken trading fees are by far the lowest:
Kraken 0.1% to 0.35%
Quadriga 0.5%
Cavirtex 0.3% to 0.8%
It depends on your trading style which exchange is the best in terms of fees. Active traders who typically trade the funds in their account many times over before withdrawing will do better with Kraken because of the much lower trading fees.
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:41:01
Good point. It's true that you could reduce your rollover fees a bit by being able to choose which position to close, but FIFO isn't a scam because an exchange can't control whether the second position is opened at a higher or lower price and if it is opened at a lower price then FIFO would reduce your rollover fees. 
At some point we may offer the option where you can choose which position you want to close, but if so it would not be implemented anytime soon. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:53:16
Our support response times are very slow right now and we're working around the clock to get on top of things. We'd like to sincerely apologize to anyone who is stuck waiting for a response. We will get back to everyone, but it might take a few days longer than it normally would.
@_date: 2016-03-14 00:31:24
Whenever you email us via our support channel a support ticket is created. You have a ticket number currently but there's no need to dig it up. You should expect an email response from our specialists tomorrow.

I'm actually Jesse's colleague and just speaking on behalf of the company here. Apologies if that wasn't clear. Your older support tickets were actually closed quite awhile ago. Sorry if things weren't properly resolved at that time. We'll get you a reply on your new tickets as soon as we can.
@_date: 2016-01-28 02:39:58
Cavirtex accounts will be transferred over and you will keep an equivalent verification level on Kraken. There should be no need to provide ID again. However, CAD funding will need to be re-activated on your account. Please contact us through our support channel if you have any questions at all about your account: 
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:58:18
An email will be going out very shortly.
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:59:49
The migration of Coinsetter and Cavirtex accounts has begun, and all users will soon receive an email from Kraken with instructions on how to log in to their accounts on Kraken.com. If you have any questions about your own account, please don’t hesitate to contact our support team at 
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:17:00
Cavirtex deposits which were completing during the migration period will be credited to corresponding new Kraken accounts. It'll take some time to process these transactions so funds may not be in your account yet when you first log in.
@_date: 2016-03-18 16:12:44
Our support team have been overburdened lately due to a massive influx of new clients. However, we're still responding to everyone within a few days. You should never have had to wait so long for a response. I can't explain why it is that we haven't replied to you yet, but I promise to get to the bottom of this ASAP. Please let me know your support ticket number via PM. We're very sorry for the bad experience. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:35:50
Apologies for the late reply on this. Please PM me your ticket number and I'll make sure our support team is looking in to this for you.
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:21:20
If you had an account with Coinsetter, then your account has been converted to a Kraken account. And don't worry, you're not at risk of losing your funds despite having two accounts registered with the same username and email. Our support team can get the situation sorted out for you. Feel free to PM me your ticket number and I'll make sure you're on the right track to accessing your funds ASAP.
@_date: 2016-01-28 00:43:30
Good point and we appreciate your feedback. An email would've been a good idea and we'll try to prioritize that more highly next time.
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:20:24
I wish I could help via reddit but we need to address this sort of thing thru our support channel. PM me your support ticket number if you like and I'll make sure you are not lost in the shuffle.

Please get in touch if ever you have any trouble at all with your account:

Our FAQs should be updated shortly, thanks. The withdrawal lock will be in effect for 3 days following the completed migration of each account.

Please open a support ticket here:  Our client engagement team will be happy to look into this for you.

With Kraken you can fund with CAD, trade CAD for bitcoins, and then trade other markets like bitcoin/USD.
On a sidenote, CAD volume and liquidity are really picking up lately and spreads are a much tighter than they used to be. Spread is $3 CAD as I type this, check it out here: 
@_date: 2016-06-15 14:51:41
We're sorry to hear that you're having trouble getting your Kraken account set up for CAD funding. To enable CAD funding, we must get your account approved by our funding partner, Vogogo, and this can sometimes cause extra delays. Please PM me your support ticket number and I'll make sure our team is doing everything we can to resolve this for you ASAP.
@_date: 2016-06-13 01:41:19
Everything is at Kraken.com.
Please feel free to get in touch with our team if you have any questions at all or want some help getting set up:  We acquired CaVirtex, so if you had an account with them it has already been converted into a Kraken account.

For Tier 2, you need only provide a few pieces of personal info incl. name and address. If you're a US resident in 1 of 38 states we service, then you'd need to get verified to Tier 3 to enable USD funding. For Tier 3, we require a copy of an ID + bill/statement showing your address.

Our team is looking into this for you. It seems the underlying issue is that you deposited a currency which we do not accept. It doesn't help that it took us so many days to respond. We're really sorry about that. Our support team is seeing a huge volume of requests right now, so things are indeed a lot slower than normal. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 19:39:58
I'm really sorry to hear that. Feel free to PM me your ticket number(s). I'll make sure we have a look thru them to see how we might serve you better moving forward. I want to make sure you start having good experiences with us from now on.

Glad to see this is resolved.

Actually, the pace of new interest in crypto overall has been skyrocketing all year and it's been challenging for our support team to keep up. We're totally committed to delivering world-class customer service and we'd like to sincerely apologize to everyone who's had a poor support experience lately. We're hiring and training new staff right now and you should see marked improvements in the weeks to come.

We've been delivering slower than normal support lately and we'd like to apologize to you for that. The crypto space is blowing up and we've seen a lot more interest than was anticipated.

Some bitcoin transactions were delayed but the issue has been resolved. Sorry for the inconvenience.
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:51:04
If you were verified with Cavirtex, then your verification will have carried over. However, we'd still need to get your account activated for CAD funding via Vogogo (funding activation is a separate process). Let me know your ticket number if you like and I'll make sure that you're on the right track. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 05:05:46
Sorry for the delay in responding to your support ticket, but we unfortunately have a large backlog of tickets right now. 
There is no hold or freeze on your account. You have two open orders in your account, one to sell your entire bitcoin balance and the other to buy with all of your cash balance. These orders are tying up your funds and must be cancelled to free the funds. Cancel these orders and you should be able to withdraw your funds or create other trades. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:26:18
It seems like you had some bad luck and got hit with a bunch of issues in a row relating to your account verification and funding limits. While we of course must abide by strict compliance standards, it does sound like you may have had a generally poor support experience in addition to your verifications related issues. The truth is that our team is extremely busy lately and this has caused delays. However we're still striving to deliver top-notch support and it strikes me that maybe you were given the runaround here. We'd like to apologize for not providing better support. There isn't much I can discuss with regard to your account verification here on reddit, so please PM me your support ticket number. I'll make sure things are being sorted out for you.

Thanks for the feedback - we are working on an improved UI for trading. We also plan to do another audit in the future (one that improves on what we did before), but infrastructure upgrades are the top priority right now.

We did have some site performance issues earlier today which were resolved a few hours ago. Things are humming along now: 
@_date: 2016-06-28 21:13:44
Thanks for the honest feedback. I'm happy to tell you that we can offer much higher CAD funding limits these days. We're also working on major UI improvements for the long term. Our site and API services were indeed significantly degraded for a few hours while news of the recent DAO hacking incident was spreading. We received huge record-breaking levels of traffic during that time. We're truly sorry for that or for any other past bad experience you've had with Kraken. Unfortunately, some risk of downtime will always be present. Even [NASDAQ breaks occasionally] ( for technical reasons. We're investing *heavily* in our tech in order to keep any downtime risk to an absolute minimum, but there will still be some risk. Monitor 24/7 how our services are doing here:

Things are indeed slow in support at Kraken currently. We are very sorry for the substandard service lately. There is so much new interest in the bitcoin space that it has been difficult to keep pace. Response times should improve significantly as soon as our current hiring blitz is completed and new hires are trained. Check out this page for support status announcements: 
@_date: 2016-06-27 13:33:02
It sounds like you understand leverage. It can be a great way to amplify your gains, but of course your risk is multiplied. Leverage is not yet available to residents of the US. We're hoping to enable that soon. Another possible reason for the greyed out leverage buttons could be that you're trading a pair on which leverage is not enabled.
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:38:18
We didn't mean to say it's not our fault. There shouldn't be a backlog in the first place, so it's not an excuse. We mention the backlog just so people know we aren't ignoring their ticket, but rather haven't had a chance to address it yet. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 04:37:12


Thanks for understanding ;) We are indeed sorting it all out.
@_date: 2016-02-05 06:50:59
I'm sorry to hear that. Make sure to enter your login 2FA code if you had one set previously (and to leave the 2FA field blank otherwise). We'll get back to you over our support channel ASAP. Response times are unfortunately still slower than normal due to a high volume of requests.

We had an issue with website connectivity earlier today. Service was fully restored about 10 hrs ago. Thanks for hoping that we get things sorted out.
@_date: 2016-02-05 04:17:59
The issue caused our clients to experience intermittent site and api connectivity, so could've impeded access to any page on the site (not just withdrawals). Service was fully restored around 7 hours ago.

You must be referring to threads on our subreddit about some recent site/api connectivity issues. I just wanted to add that EUR funding was never offline, just inaccessible temporarily for some clients while our service was being restored. There are no issues currently with the site or with EUR funding.

We agree that an exchange site should be fully functional 24/7. It's our mission to provide this to the Bitcoin community. We've fallen short on occasion in the past, but we wanted to make sure you guys know that we're investing heavily in our tech infrastructure. Expect major improvements in the weeks to come.
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:04:58
Admittedly, there was an administrative oversight on our part in the CloudFlare case you're referring to. But there were also some serious mischaracterizations of events, so we published clarifications here:
@_date: 2016-02-05 04:58:22
We have been DDOS'd occasionally, but this most recent issue was related to a technical problem our CAD funding partner Vogogo had. It should have only affected our interface with this funding partner, but unfortunately it affected other systems as well. We've made the necessary adjustment so other systems are no longer affected, but CAD funding through Vogogo will be offline until the technical problems are fixed on their end. (Funding in all other currencies is operating smoothly.)
@_date: 2016-02-05 04:34:05
Sounds like you might have got our mass email from support about the delays. Yeah, we got blasted with support requests after the Coinsetter/Cavirtex migration. The migration had to happen in stages over a period of time, so we can totally see why people had so many questions and frustrations. And there were definitely a few hiccups. Support response times are still slower than normal, but we've got a handle by now on the common issues/questions clients tend to have, so things should be starting to speed up.
@_date: 2016-02-16 23:46:24
We'll try to improve on that. Thanks a lot for the feedback.
@_date: 2016-02-05 07:00:30
The problem was intermittent site and api connectivity, not a withdrawals issue. Service was fully restored about 10 hrs ago. Apologies for the connectivity problems earlier and for posting so late here. Details on the issue:

As already mentioned, watermarks can be a problem if they obstruct our evaluation of the documents. We appreciate everyone raising this issue though and will certainly examine our policy around watermarks and see if we can be more lenient about allowing them so long as it doesn't undermine the evaluation of the documents. 
But I'd like to stress that we take the security of documents and other personal information that our clients provide very seriously. As already mentioned, we do apply our own watermarks to documents. Also, note from our security page that "all sensitive account information, including verification documents, is encrypted and access to multiple highly secure systems is required to decrypt it" (from

We don't censor our subreddit and 2 or 3 users have been spamming by repeating the same issues over and over again. We're considering tougher moderation.
We've also gathered a ton of feedback from traders and have started work on some big UI improvements. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 23:40:46
We normally aim to always respond in under 24 hrs and we often respond in just minutes. However our support team is currently overburdened and we're missing our targets by 2-3 days. So, if you've been waiting 1-2 days already, you may actually have to wait another 1-2 days for a response. The increased volume of support requests is mostly due to our recent acquisition of Coinsetter/Cavirtex and our simultaneous expansion into the US.
The good news is that ticket volumes are dropping back closer to normal. Plus our team is adjusting really well to the new types of inquiries/issues we're seeing. I can't say anything definitive, but we're hopeful response times will be back under 24 hrs within a week or so. Please accept our sincere apologies for these delays. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 17:26:27
An issue with our site was causing some related problems earlier today, but it's been resolved. Sorry for the trouble.

Yes, we accept wires in many currencies. Feel free to get in touch with our team to discuss details: 
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:52:53
We're already setting up with a new CAD funding partner. The integration has taken a bit longer than we'd hoped, but Interac and EFT depositing will be live soon. 
@_date: 2016-09-02 12:57:44
As is stated in the email, there will be no interruption in CAD funding service. We have a new payment provider that we are integrating with and it will take several weeks to complete this integration. However, while the integration is being completed, Canadian clients can still withdraw CAD by domestic EFT transfer and deposit CAD by international wire. So it is absolutely false to say that "No cash can come in or go out for weeks."
@_date: 2016-09-12 19:20:07
We are still accepting CAD deposits with no deposit fee on our end. The only issue is that deposits currently require an international wire. We've partnered with another payment provider similar to Vogogo and will be offering domestic CAD deposits again as soon as the integration is finished (expected to take a few weeks). We do have 2fa - for most people enabling 2fa for login is all you need. However, if you decide to enable 2fa for funding or trading, these must be used together with the settings lock in order to be effective. Here's some info about our security settings from the support center:

We're continually seeking out newer and better fiat funding options, but I don't have any special news re: GBP processing at this time.
Sorry your friend wasn't able to send that wire. That's not a typical experience. I hope the situation was fully explained by our staff, and please let me know if that's not the case. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:10:57
No problem! Look out for our upcoming announcement.

Sorry you had such a long wait. If you like, please PM me your ticket number and I'll make double sure we're doing everything we can to ensure smoother funding for you in the future. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:37:39
CAD EFT withdrawals are up and running but processing slower than expected while we work out some kinks with the new integration.
@_date: 2016-09-09 19:17:28
We're sorry that your friend's account was compromised. We offer a lot options and flexibility for setting up different account security options and some are more secure than others. A downside of offering all the options and flexibility is that it increases the chance that some clients might make certain choices without fully understanding the consequences. We are considering ways that we can simplify the options and make things more intuitive. Your friend did not have a very secure setup because he was using a static password for the login 2fa. While this does add some security, it's essentially just like having a longer account password. It's more vulnerable than using a one-time password (OTP) for the 2fa because you enter the same password every time you login. With an OTP for the login 2fa, you enter a different password every time you login, so it's much more secure. 
@_date: 2016-09-02 17:50:46
OP conveniently left out the second half of the email that goes on to explain that while the integration is being finished Canadian clients will still have access to CAD funding as follows:
Deposits: Free CAD deposits by international wire (no charge on our side but any banking fees are your responsibility). 
Withdrawals: $10 flat fee ETF withdrawals (same fee as with Vogogo). 
@_date: 2016-09-28 20:26:37
The app was removed a few weeks back. We're hoping to have it back up soon.

We are indeed partnered with Fidor. German Kraken clients who are also Fidor clients can perform easy direct EUR transfers. And all of our European clients have the advantage of fast SEPA EUR transfers.
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:02:49
I think we could have been more helpful in the ticket instead of just saying, "see this security page," but if you read the security page you will see that "all sensitive account information, including verification documents, is encrypted and access to multiple highly secure systems is required to decrypt it." So we secure your personal information very well, but of course even high security could possibly be compromised.

We use Vogogo, but we have additional CAD funding options in the works. No interruption in CAD funding service is expected.
@_date: 2016-07-25 20:10:16
If you haven't enabled your global settings lock and your login credentials were hacked, then the attacker would be able to remove your funding 2FA. This is why it's so important to enable login 2FA. And for extra security, you can enable global settings lock to work in conjunction with funding 2FA.
@_date: 2016-07-26 07:05:26
Just pointing out that we have 2fa for login as well, since your earlier comment seemed to suggest that you thought we only offer 2fa for funding. 2fa for funding is meant to be used with the settings lock in which case you cannot turn it off without removing the settings lock. This definitely needs to be made clearer though and we will also look at a redesign so it's more intuitive.

We're working on additional CAD funding methods and do not expect any interruption in service. That's all I can say for right now. We'll make an announcement when more details are settled.
