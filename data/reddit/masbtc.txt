@_date: 2018-01-07 17:15:14
you are ignorant. violating TOS doesnt give them right to free money, *lmao*
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:28:15
I think its explicitly obvious what banning unregulated trading accounts mean. checkmate

Increasing segwit adoption = decreasing fees. Quick maths
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:57:54
I'm pretty sure its closer to ~~5.5 billion.~~ 50k*11000~
EDIT: 550 MILLION
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:00:27
Its a receive address...
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:20:02
What what you suggest be the alternative to decentralization? Is there any coin out there that doesn't have a "leader", a lot of adoption, etc. Obviously no coin has "a lot" of adoption, but I think bitcoin does the best for security, besides Monero for privacy.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:44:54
aka centralized
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:24:55
I don't think you know how transaction fees work
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:47:34
Oh no only 1000% returns in 12 months?? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO I CANT BUY ANYTHING WITH 10X
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:36:36
Your feeling is irrelevant, hes getting his money back from coinbase, a reputable company. The money doesnt just fall into a blackhole. Ive been scammed before through a debit card purchase, and all that was necessary was a phone call to the bank file a claim, money was returned, and was up to the merchant to file if he felt wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:05:38
Why would you count the block reward in calculating each tx fee? This doesn't make sense to me, and yes, I like BTC and other alts more than BCH.
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:15:51
Neither can any other top tier coin. :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:19:44
The 1000$ investment across the board sounds like an interesting and fun idea, I may have to throw 1k$ into that from my trading stack of coins and try it out.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:27:43
Have Fun.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:43:34
So, centralization. Yes its possible though.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:22:35
Their roadmap is changing one line in code to up blocksize as they please.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:26:43
Wrong, plenty of people made 1000% gains on here. Sounds like you didnt though. Get in now or whenever you think the bottom is.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:00:44
Same idea, different bot and on LN
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:37:56
I mean there's always the fact that it's the most decentralized. That is important to a lot of people.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:36:32
I mean the bank for a claim if he deposited through a bank would be the first logical step, I dont see how you can believe his money is just gone. Thats fraud, which is obviously illegal, not sure if you know that either.

How can I set an icon to a numeric value? I was looking for a complete redesign of the screen in which the time was smaller and the counters the main part, but I will use this method if it works until someone can figure this out, if possible.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:39:20
How do I "claim" or sell my Diamond or Gold or at what date should I have had BTC in order to receive these alts?
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:46:29
Tell them its up 700% in a year.
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:39:44
Uh, you mean 10sats/byte? How does that equal 15$ unless you have an ~~assload~~ shitassload in of inputs before sending one transaction
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:43:48
Features? Blockchain Tech
Secure? Yes
Fast? Improbable but obviously 1000000x faster than ACH &amp; Wire Transfers
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:05:34
Lol... BTC has so much more security than a bank. AKA your own wallet that you control. Even with that one point banks control your account.

Your counter argument, sir? Oh wait, you are full of asshole shit
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:37:46
Ah yes, why don't we change our roadmap to:
1) Go to line 5
2) Go to word "blocksize"
3) Change value to "1 terabyte"
4) Profit???

@_date: 2018-01-22 03:35:55
So what your saying is lightning is the future, but way too confusing, which is why we need this all in back end and have a super clean front end that is basically a wallet. No average person is going to do all that work and research, we need clean GUIs soon.

Of course, the big titles are just misleading to create just this. Fake news across the board for the most part. They just want names attached to the trading accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:41:04

That's true, smart of the hackers actually. I wonder if ransomware takes data from your computer even if you pay to get your computer back? I don't know much about malware besides they "lock" your files kinda and pay you to recover it.

its not

$1,000 today is obviously $1,000, but who says it won't have less buying power. 1 BTC today will be 1 BTC tomorrow, but who says its buying power will be the same tomorrow. You can't compare USD to USD if you also compare USD to BTC, it's just ignorant.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:26:51
Well ofc if you were really paranoid about ledger or trezor, u can see their code online, and check on ur device when you receive it. Any way,  the key is made when you set up the device, not at the factory.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:18:56
Ah yes my glorious comment karma. First off read my comment again. And again, think.
Why copy ~~it~~ **LN** to other coin if it works perfectly fine on BTC. Everyone will use BTC if it works well. If it doesn't work well, why would BCH or anyone else want to use it.
That dumb it down enough for you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:06:16
Who is that?
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:12:36
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:49:19
thanks for the generous offer!
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:07:02
Yes also this works too. Generally setting up it with the seed it creates for you is easier and can be safer
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:45:19
When in doubt, zoom out. Sure it was 30% more, but 80%+ is unsustainable. Surely you cant be serious about 50% gains being bad. That is stupid good for ANY investment. Also it has not been "still" dropping. Check the charts.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:51:05
What is the difference if someone buys a contract to buy a coin at a fixed price in the future vs. someone who just buys it now and sells it in the future? Both ways lead to them selling it in the future at the higher (or lower) price that it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:09:01
Sort of like a paper wallet but in your brain. Take your 12 word phrase and memorize it with mnemonics. Most secure yet could be forgotten if not practiced enough. Sort of interesting that you can store value in your own brain, I bet I could test it with like 50$ or something would be a cool experiment.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:55:39
Pull over with your hazards on the highway :P
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:58:05

So what's your portfolio like right now
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:24
I'm not disagreeing that the current state is very hard to use, but you think after 9 years of only up, from $.008 to near $20k, it's going to deflate nearly 17000% (this figure may be off, someone correct my math) in such a short time?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:02:21
So I can get anything at the dollar store for free? :D
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:49:07
Then dont pay that much. That is unnecessarily unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:07:46
Use segwit, 20$ and 5 minutes. Sure it's still a lot, but I just sent a quick .1 btc to binance to test some stuff and it was quick.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:47:21
Looks like you didnt look at the picture

Let me rephrase. Data is great; great for analyzing and reviewing, and showing trends that *have* happened. It can be used to show what **may** come in the future, but we can't be certain of anything.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:47
So you are holding 0 of any crypto
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:09
I get that, but you are wanting to buy bitcoin near zero? So near 1$? That's just outrageous no matter what crypto you like the most.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:38:55
BUT I WANNA SEE EVERYONES BITCOIN ART
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:09:42
So theres no like by hand decryption I could do? Like what the hash function does by not through an electronic.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:04:28
One could say that about each previous correction when those happened aswell.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:39:16
They wont use BTC because it has LN. They will use BTC because it is fast (if it is of course.)
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:46:12
To be fair, he did create a currency that ***CAN*** buy coffee as of today, just not very efficiently yet at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:36:21
Nearly 20% but yes
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:44:28
Obviously, because they dont sell fake rolexes aka fraud
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:07:37
No, because its less than that. Yes, they will cover any transaction cost.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:12:07
ltc-&gt;btc is down 7%~ today
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:40:18
Sure if BCH becomes the biggest crypto in terms of value and use, it will be come what BTC is right now. Lots of people sending txn at once = higher fees.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:37:52
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:09
buy buy buy! I think 16k or 15k will be the lowest so Im getting in rn hopefully
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:11:22
Ah yes the +50% in 4 weeks bag that we all hate.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:24:05
yes lol not tryna give out my ledger seed words
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:35:52
Well it will because its declined almost 100% in the last century, people agree with that.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:48:38

lmao, but both will be released at the same time
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:46
It was 14000!! When I went away for 30 minutes!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:01:40
Does this mean LN for LTC is also released at the same time or is it separate things?
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:57:16


Oh yes, let me just paste my key that is implying to be kept to myself, aka a  ***private*** key into a ***non private*** site
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:48:14
There will be no point to copy it... If it works well they will use that, if it doesn't why copy a broken project. Think.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:19:15
It's just a receive address on the card
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:52:26
Yea! And then make sure to show everyone a picture of it on reddit
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:03:00

50% is 50% no matter the cap, this is healthy for the entire asset class.

In exchanges that rape you sure, but actual sending fees from wallet to wallet is not by any means.

you don't lose shit if you don't sell shit. you don't lose shit if you realize you lost it when you put it in. you don't lose shit if you put it what you can afford to have lost already. you don't lose if you didn't buy at fucking 20k. lmao have a good day
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:06:48
eh, you should never have it online or on electronics like your phone notepad, email, etc. It is the safest on a paper wallet either laminated or something like engraved into metal. I'd take it off immediately.
