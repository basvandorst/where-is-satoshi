Hmm. So who decides what the actual current value of Bitcoin is? It varies widely on the different exchanges.
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:48:45
Hmm, have they been hacked? I'm getting a 500 Internal Server Error when I go to their page.
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:46:17
Don't, I lost money with them.
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:48:57
What do you think cash is, other than an "I OWE YOU"?

Something is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it.

There's nothing to prevent the government from confiscating ANYTHING you have if they really wanted to.
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:02:02
Tell that to Silk Road
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:08:03
They'll be paying us to take their bitcoins! :P
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:41:52
My shop is on there! 
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:37:19
Yeah I joined their group! :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:37:31
$84 and falling...
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:40:55
Oh you mean those gold foil wrapped chocolates?
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:50:42
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:35:34
That's why money is so dirty these days.
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:13:02
What's with the random *italics* and **bold?**
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:55:19
For that I'd recommend looking up Shapeways

Can you please tell us, will they ever find Bigfoot in the future?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:27:28
If they haven't bought in yet, how could they be a big buyer?
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:49:36
Personally I think you'd be better just buying BTC with the money. The price is increasing pretty rapidly and you'll have missed out on that by the time you ever get the actual hardware.
@_date: 2013-03-25 01:01:48
Ok, thanks
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:36:35
Thanks, I didn't know it existed.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:40:57
Keep dreaming. Coinbase almost never had BTC to sell even before this bubble burst.
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:39:42
What-what the hell is a gigawatt?
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:00:06
I can't even get the site to load...
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:36:57
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:22:28
Could somebody explain how to get this to run in Mac OSX? Thanks
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:42:29
They are fine with it. They still charge the seller fees based on the price in USD. And it costs $0.20 to list an item. So Etsy still gets their money.
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:04:48
Gold pressed latinum FTW!
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:23:34
I used it today with absolutely no problems. My deposit showed up in my account in less than 10 minutes.
