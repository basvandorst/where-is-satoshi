Hope you didn't buy 2nd hand at a discount or EBAY for that matter.

Just moved to Dallas a few months ago... seems about right.

If Bitcoin became mainstream and a huge success, Trump will certainly say he invented it and it's doing so well because of him. And his supporters will eat that shit up.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:19:34
Hialeah and bitcoin could be dangerous! ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:42:45
Fake news anyone.

@_date: 2017-12-05 14:12:26

When I dip you dip we dip 
You put your hand upon my hip 
When you dip I dip we dip
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:41:59
This is a dip....? I need moar!!! I'm hodling for bigger dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:57:11
Yea man I fully expect a significant dip between now and Jan. 1.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:11:12
Yes a shit metric ton of people are talking about it. But that doesn't mean they know shit. 
Everybody and their grandmother is talking about it but one of the 1st comments they say is "man I wish I would have know about this sooner, $10k for one bitcoin is too much I'll never buy any now."
MUAHHAHHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAH!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:37:17
Yea I bought a few satoshi when a long time ago (last week) $10k was all the rage. I was pissed I didn't unload when it was $10k due to the recent skyrocket in value.
But I'm am overly confident we'll see some insane dips between now and Jan 1. 
I plan to go big during the dip, hodl on those coins until the next insane value increase, then cash in a portion of those earning, and finally whatever I decide to leave in BTC I'll hodl for the very long run. 
Merry Xmas Bitcoin Buddies. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:20:56
$10k...  seems so long ago already
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:10:49
Hey man if acquiring some satoshi is this mind blowing stressful you're probably better off just hanging with the r/wallstreetbets goons.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:13:04
Lmao if you think about it this is fuckin hilarious. Someone is in a bind and needs money asap and they're last resort is cashing their bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:43:49
Lmao I've never seen any of these movies but the post Xmas dump face fits.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:50:02
Tell me about it.... I did a small amount to buy in, and I wanted the money to clear in Coinbase before doing a much larger deposit. And the value was &lt; $10k at this point too. Now this shit is $15k... with so much speculation that BTC will dip over the next 2-3 I have to hodl before buying more. (PISSED)
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:01:45
NOW! Satoshi is on holiday, when he gets back he'll push the button ending the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:43:00
I can only imagine in my wildest dreams the bitcoin scams we'll read about over the yrs. 
I mean grandma sends $50,000 to Billy Bob when he's in jail in Uganda and that's cash money. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:10:04
Ok Trump (sarcasm).
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:36:29
Yea man, hold tight. Way back, a long time ago when BTC broke $10k I got in for the 1st time and bought some coin via Coinbase. JUST this morning I got an alert from Coinbase that BTC broke $15k (who wouldve thunk it). And my deposit in Coinbase had cleeared. It was withdrawn a week ago from my bank.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:54:40
Police will have a laughing feat over this while chowing down on some donuts. 
But on the flip side you might get the 1st ever police report for stolen bitcoin, that would be cool. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:45:19
Miamiblue, you called for me?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:15:03
My body is reggie.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:18:10
Hodl until the 10th and/or 18th. The dip is coming hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:19:02
TL:DW - HODL
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:57:08
I want a bigger dip. ��
