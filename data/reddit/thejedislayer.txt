I think you're missing my point. At least, that is how I am seeing it. What I say that people believe/think taxation is theft, they are coming from backgrounds in political philosophy that do not support the notion of taxation or very limited forms of taxation, such as you would expect to find in libertarian circles. When you make the statement that and I quote, "By virtue of living in the US, residents have tacitly agreed to abide by the laws of the country, including the laws regarding taxation," I disagree here. While I recognize where you are coming from with this statement, it doesn't take away from my earlier statement that all property, rather it be private or public, is subjective to the whims of everyone. In other words, simply living within an established boundary that a country calls its own does not suddenly make everything that country, its government, does as right by every individual within that country's borders, even if a majority of the populace views such things as taxation as right and just. To go further with this, there are only two ways to enforce property rights: Mass acceptance that what is mine is mine and what is yours is yours (first dibs) or the use of force.
People can believe/think whatever they want when it comes to property - One can't force them to accept a certain claim to property by others, they have to agree to accept it. The only reason why we don't have to have a police man on every street to defend someone's property is due to mass acceptance of property claims here in America and a respect for the laws that govern this nation. To bring it home, taxation is property being moved from one group to another, and that property is subjective by the individuals involved. You may see taxation as just and right in America, but another individual may not see it as such. Laws, too, are all subjective, which is why laws must be enforced when a person "violates" a law.

He said that taxation is necessary and that Theselusperse needed to come back down to reality. It is his argument, but it still stands that he makes the claim there is no other solution. I'm not sure why you think I'm advocating or saying there are any "realistic alternatives to taxation." Does that mean none exist, who knows.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:30:15
I really dislike what you've said here. Basically, what you've told Theseusperse is that there is no other solution besides taxation, as taxation is "necessary." Necessary to whom - apparently in "countless" areas of our lives. You're right, there is a difference between making a stand for something one believes in, then just throwing blanket statements out there to quell the opposition.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:20:05
Within some political ideologies, such as Anarcho-Capitalism, taxation is considered theft. In other realms, such as a democratic system governed by the people who participate in it, taxes are not largely considered theft. We could get into it about what constitutes just taxation and what doesn't, but it's easier to just end it by saying that all property, including what's "owed" to the government, is subjective to the whims of those who participate. In other words, you may not think taxation is theft, but some do regardless of any "evidence" you or others claim to the contrary.

While not exactly technical advice, I went through a similar experience when I first cashed in my Bitcoins for money then transferred. Needless to say, everything turned out alright. Give it some time.

I was wondering why the price kept going up and down rapidly. I sold my bitcoins, luckily, at $9.30, the afternoon following the night the market hitting upwards of $9.49.

I have a question for you in that regard then. I went over to this website here  which is offering a low-power consumption FPGA for around 832 M/hash. From what it appears, I would have to flash the chip myself in order to make it mine for Bitcoins, correct? If so, can you explain how hard this would be? For 599 dollars a piece, I could buy two of these for 1200 bucks and get more power than I could for 1000 bucks for one regular GPU mining setup machine.
Thank you for your time.

Not everyone knows about virtual machines, and there's no guarantee a virtual machine won't get infected. I'd say the SAFEST way to eliminate any potential risk is to use a two factor login to MtGox, a virtual machine where the OS reverts to a previous saved, clean state every time, not just where the user left off.

@_date: 2012-04-13 18:17:45
FPGA looks intriguing; however, from my quick researching of it, it looks like you have to program it to do Bitcoining, and that some FPGAs only do a few hundred hashes per second. While it might save on electricity cost, the price tag seems a bit steep for only a few hundred M/hashes. 
If I am wrong, could you please elaborate further on the technology and why you support it? It looks interesting, but idk if it's practical in producing G/hashes I would need without breaking the bank.
@_date: 2012-11-28 15:46:11

Thank you very much. I just hope it doesn't actually take me 13 weeks, as some have reported, to get my first one from ordering tomorrow. 
@_date: 2012-04-17 17:58:06
The whole problem with Bitcoin mining is that it'll continue to get harder and harder to mine and the Bitcoin handout will dwindle down; however, there are new things emerging like FPGAs, which can lower power consumption while still putting out high performance in M/hash rates. The other thing you'd want to do is try to form a local team to join a mining pool with, and split the profits as your team sees fit. In this way, you don't have to bare the burden of hardware/electricity cost alone, and everyone can make more Bitcoins by pulling resources together.

Even if he reformatted, it doesn't mean he can't get reinfected as soon as he visits whatever site or downloads whatever program infected him in the first place. What OP should do is run security scans from programs like Super Anti-Spyware and Malwarebytes, and delete any bad entries. Finally, he should use a good browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, install Web of Trust, No Script, etc, and double check before he re-downloads programs and visits websites.
Reformatting should be a last ditch effort to clean an infected machine.

This is truly scary and astounding to watch unfold. Scary because the price is rising so high, one has to wonder win the bubble is going to burst. Astounding because Bitcoin is doing well. :}
@_date: 2012-06-17 19:09:26
That's pretty much how I pegged it, too. Someone told me months ago they were halving bitcoin blocks in half from 50 to 25, yet the only think I thought about was, "Wouldn't that increase market price per bitcoin?" I can only see this working out for the miners, so long as the buyers continue to believe the money they're putting into the bitcoin buying is worth it.

Why are regulations a good thing, honestly? Are property rights not enough to stop trash companies from creating landfill dumps next to JPMorgan? When was the last time you saw Wal-Mart and Meijer employees duke it out in a turf war? Does capitalism not help provide for millions of people, thereby helping the "overall good" you speak about? I'm just confused what exactly is so great about regulations beyond theft, breach of contract and fraud?

Considering that the Android Market allows developers to come in and set the price of their software, sell whatever software they want (mostly), I think it would be great to allow developers to also accept Bitcoin as a form of payment through Google. I think that it will be a few years before we see something like this go mainstream, and that's being optimistic about Bitcoin's future. I want Bitcoin to succeed every bit as much as everyone else here does, but I feel we're still in the birthing pains of this new currency.
@_date: 2013-02-20 14:21:38
If Bitcoin somehow becomes such a success, even if it only reaches that supposed "$55,000" mark a blog article was talking about, I would give a significant portion of it to my parents. I want them to be secured in their retirement. Here's to hoping for something wild to happen.

This kinda brings home the point. Regulators try to regulate what people do, and people find ways around such regulations. I'm not saying this is good or bad, but showing just how stupid it really all does become at the end of the day.

I, too, recently got my coins to their final destination. At any rate, I don't know if I'm going to use Coinbase or not.

I'd also say it was a better route for the government to take not to try and shut Bitcoin down. It is a fight they are ill prepared for every second more people join in on the network.

How about getting the shit sued out of them? I don't need regulators to regulate me making sure I don't kill my customers. I have an incentive to make sure I don't get sued or go to jail for my products.
And for the sake of the argument. Say I could murder my customers, you think I'd be in business for very long? I can't see many people coming back, can you?
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:27:30
I won't sell because I fully expect the price to rise again. People come on here and act like the end of the world just happened when there is a bust. It's beyond me why one would invest in something so new and shaky, that they put way too much in that they cannot afford to personally lose. I'll be honest, I wish I had sold at 48$ when it was falling down to as low as 34$, so that I could buy even more Bitcoins, but because of the way the Bitcoin market is, I knew the price could shoot right back up and screw me over. I played this bust very conservatively because I knew the price was going to make a rebound. I guessed it actually pretty close, too, where its falling point would be.
As of right now, the price was at a low of 34$ last time I checked and is now at 39.78$ to show you just how volatile this all really is. I'm in this for the long haul, and everyone needs to decide if you're a trader/speculator or a saver.
@_date: 2013-03-20 01:32:12
**Wait, let me get this straight. You want government to use force against an employer to compensate their employees with benefits and "livable" wages.**


Sure they will. If I dump toxic radiation into a river, you think the state is going to permit that for very long when other people are being affected by it? Granted, it happens all the time and it shouldn't, but this falls into a property rights issue.


You said the government needs to regulate the economy to stop war in your very first post. If that's true, the only way I can see that you mean by "war" is two companies going head to head with briefcases.


Yes, because thankfully we have big government that comes in, bails out banks that make bad decisions, and end up creating moral hazard. Life is so much better under a regulated market where Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are propped up to give low-interest loans to those that don't qualify for loans because "everyone deserves a home" according to the U.S. government.

If I got rich of off Bitcoins, I would invest all of it into a savings account and allow it to grow over my lifetime. When my parents reached retirement age, I would surprise them with a significant sum of money for their retirement. I would not blow it on cars, houses, etc, as the money would probably be a once in a lifetime event/deal.

I am no way an expert, only an opinion.
For me, I'd rather have my holdings in Bitcoin. While Bitcoin isn't popular yet in mainstream society, it has several things that make it a big plus for me. I don't have to carry it around, except on a USB flash drive. I don't have to hire security to protect it (beyond my own self-defense) and I can create a secure wallet/password that will make it so that only I can ever "unlock" my Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:25:06


I entirely disagree with your idea about what employers should be made to do. This isn't some altruistic country where employers are treated like second class citizens because they opened up a business. If you willingly go and apply and get hired by a store owner, the benefits and pay you receive should be negotiated between you and your employer, but not by force with government. You and anyone else are free to reject the offer your potential employer offers you and find work someplace else.


I'm not too sure what you're saying here? The simple fact that waste is dumped into rivers, etc, proves that regulation doesn't work because the government doesn't enforce it.


Sure it is. When the Deep Sea Horizon oil spill happened, BP paid billions to affected businesses and home owners. Even if government wasn't involved, legal action by those affected by BP would have been brought to court, and BP would have been sued to oblivion.


You should clarify because you've got several other people here wondering what you mean when corporations start wars.


I entirely, again, disagree with you here. It was regulation in the first place by the government that gave people home loans they couldn't afford. As far as I understand it, no one was turned away. How do you make "tougher" regulations when the U.S. government's actions were, "Here, take this free money and buy a home. We don't care if you can't afford to pay us back, just take it. If you default, oh well!"
In capitalism, some people fail and some succeed. Not everyone deserves a home because not everyone has made the right financial choices with their life. Wall Street should never have been bailed out for their bad decisions but they were.

I am sorry for your loss. I often have feared such a thing happening to me as well. If I can make a recommendation, you should make an offline storage of your Bitcoins. E.g. Using an external HDD with Bitcoin wallet installed on it and placing your Bitcoins there. In that way, you aren't having to trust a third party and it is impossible to get your Bitcoins stolen while they're offline (unless someone physically steals your external HDD)
I would say the main risk is a HDD failure, but that can be remedied simply by backing up your Bitcoins to another offline media (storage)

No one deserves anything. Let me ask you something very serious. Do you think you have a right to other people's sweat? Do you believe you have ownership over their labor and body? Food, housing, medicines, etc, are created by people who give up their time and labor to produce these things, yet from what I am getting from you is that everyone has a "right" to these things, even for nothing at all on their part. To drive the point home, is it right that I go work at a job all day producing something only for my labor in what I produced, whatever it is, to be given to someone that is "needy" because it is their right?
In nature, there is no such thing as a right to shelter, food and medicine. A man has a natural right to own his life and by that extension to create and produce things with his hands and mind to better himself, but he doesn't have a "right" to any other man's labor. If a man wants to give his labor or the fruits of his labor to the "needy," he may do so of his own free will. I entirely disagree with you, and I'm sorry that you don't wish to further this discussion because you are insulted that I don't believe in stealing.

It'll probably collapse to around 38$ before holding there for awhile and slowly climbing up and past 50$ for the first time. I'm floating this of course, but I don't see this going much lower than 35$.
