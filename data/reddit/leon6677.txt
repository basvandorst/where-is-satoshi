@_date: 2015-06-08 23:20:33
I would agree
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:40:19
that is the beauty of bitcoin it allows us to have some skin in the game for a change. Isn't this how the world works except the average person is usually locked out....
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:07:24
Is this accessible in US markets ?
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:50:19
the average person can buy bitcoin what is so delusional about that. The average person could not buy fitbit before it went public or uber or anu other technology for that matter. WIth bitcoin the public does not have to wait they can invest in it now before it goes mainstream

Hopefully this signals the death of altcoins

and this exactly how I know it is going higher. The world would never let a guy like that be right in the long term.
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:40:22
When things like this happen it strengthens and makes people understand the relevance of btc 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:46:46
that is true. But long term it is going up and it will have a buy side imbalance again soon.....

They are using the 2 weeks to fix the software and to replace BTC that was stolen imho. I believe the software is fixed and now they are buying on gox and selling on bitstamp to replace the stolen coins and get the balance sheet in good working order. They they will announcing they are opening back up. There will be a run on their deposits for a while and then once everyone sees things are going through it will settle down. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:05:35
just be patient MT GOx will get fixed
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:06:13
it is possible. Gets BTC China out of China.

@_date: 2014-02-24 13:43:04
Yes I am pretty sure it is all cleaned up now. Now it is making sense. Gox did lose coins to they imho. They are now good and then some. They manipulated the market for 2 weeks that is why they said nothing. Why would they say what they were doing. Now btc will slowly climb. Thais is crazy
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:13:00
bitcoin will play out like nature. Survival of the fittest. This is the only way it should play out. Otherwise we would have a false system instead of a true market system. Bitcoin will be a world market and not manipulated like fiat. Look people just accept it crypto currency is not going away. The genie is out of the bottle. Embrace and try to understand it our get out of the way. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:16:21

Dear Secretary Lew, Chairwoman Yellen, Commissioner Curry, Acting Chairman Wetjen, Chairman Gruenberg, Chairwoman White:
I write today to express my concerns about Cash. This paper currency is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly unstable and disruptive to our economy. For the reasons outlined below, I urge regulators to take appropriate action to limit the abilities of this highly unstable currency.
By way of background, Cash is a currency that has gained notoriety in recent months due to its relation to illegal transactions. Each Cash is defined by a paper bill, which allows for anonymous and irreversible transactions. The very features that make Cash attractive to some also attract criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement. Due to Cash’s anonymity, the market has been extremely susceptible to muggers and scam artists stealing millions from Cash users. Anonymity combined with Cash’s ability to finalize transactions quickly, makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse fraudulent transactions.
Cash has also become a haven for individuals to buy black market items. Individuals are able to anonymously purchase items such as drugs and weapons illegally. The clear ends of Cash for either transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling make me weary of its use. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued a report just this month stating, “There is widespread concern about the Cash’s possible impact on national currencies, its potential for criminal misuse, and the implications of its use for taxation.” Before the U.S. gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.

The hack on Target is only going to happen more often. At some point retail will say no to credit cards because of the theft. Target was worried about going out of business do to the theft. This is getting serious. If target used the bitcoin blockchain to facilitate a money transfer instead of the cc companies the risk would be very different and more manageable. Target would only need to secure its BTC not every customers financial identity.

@_date: 2014-06-07 13:08:35

Miners need to hold. Stop selling. Miners should only sell to pay for their fixed expenses in the mining operation. The whole world is now watching bitcoin. The next time it breaks (1200+) out the world is going to panic because they don't own it and the train is leaving the station.

This reminds me of 5 years ago when I told a young attorney to specialize in the medical marijuana industry because it would be one the fastest growing sectors of our economy for 20 years...... No I would say the same about Bitcoin. It will be one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy for the next 20 years. Be glad the other attorneys think your crazy. You get to grab all their market share. Then you can take that to the blockchain....

Very smart businessmen have went bankrupt and have come back. Those same people will say they learned a tremendous amount through that process. Look at the positives and move forward. Decide if you still believe in btc and pick your self up. I believe this invention will change the world. It will not be easy there will be up and downs but it will move forward. Seriously did we really think it would go straight up ? Has it in the past ? No

any one that left their money in gox did not read r/bitcoin. I came into btc in October and by Jan it was obvious gox was bad. All you had to do was look at the price discrepancy in lat jan. to figure that out. If you did not see the signs then you should not be investing in btc until it stabilizes and becomes a world currency. Stay in fiat sit back and watch it.

@_date: 2014-02-27 23:43:50
It was more than an educated guess sorry. Once I read " the reason BTC is higher on mt gox than any other exchange is because no one sells there. They cant get their money out so there is an imbalance on the exchange. (more buyers than sellers.  The only way to get out was to transfer btc out) Once you think about that you realized the exchange price was telling us all something. That made me realize it was a serious problem. So don't tell me it was a guess. I have the email to family and friends to prove it. The email was date Jan 26th as follows
Rumor has it the bitcoin exchange Mtgox.com is going out of business. if anyone has coins there get them out.

Dear Senator Manchin,
I have always admired your bipartisan leadership. However, your recent open letter in opposition to Bitcoin struck me as extremely uninformed and full of mistaken assumptions. Bitcoin and other digital currencies can help millions of Americans make payments without being beholden to high credit card fees. It is actually less anonymous than using cash for transactions; cash will always be an easier way to launder money. In addition, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who I believe have helped fund some of your past campaigns, are pouring money into developing companies and applications which provide a trustworthy infrastructure for digital payment systems built around Bitcoin. There is more Silicon Valley investment Bitcoin companies right now than almost any other segment of technology. By opposing this innovation, you are mistakenly going to cost jobs and tax revenue for millions of law abiding Americans in West Virginia and other states. State regulators in NY and throughout the country are hard at work developing common sense regulations to prevent money-laundering through digital currencies, so this will not be an issue when the new regulations come out. Please reconsider your ill-advised stance and announce that you (like Senator Tom Carper of Delaware) are eager to see what innovations Bitcoin can bring. It can be a force for good in the world. --Sincerely, _____

Can't have a secure blockchain without a valued bitcoin

I have a skyhook machine for sale. I have never been able to get it to work. However I never really put much time into it. I no longer have a retail establishement to place it at so it just sits here in my office. First 3 BTC takes it. I will pay shipping. Nexus 7 works fine. Power works fine. Dollar bill read boots up. The skyhook software needs to be updated it is still at .76.  $750.00

The more these players fragment the market the better it will be for bitcoin because it is universal.

I'm pretty sure there were two leaders of this country that argued your exact point and one died in a shoot out. Seriously I'm going to look it up.
I'm pretty sure I read about it in the book creature of jekyll island were Alexander Hamilton and James burr have two different beliefs in banking . These were founding fathers of our banking system as we know it today.

And this is exactly what the average joe can not understand. Well said. I have been trying to tell my associates however they fail to comprehend. &gt;Spoken like someone who has never been a part of a start up from the inside. This kind of growth is normal, you just aren't use to seeing it publicly.

Apple wont support it because miners don't run on Macs correct me if I'm wrong but all mining rigs are pc based? This has the potential to hurt Apple does it not. They are probably working on an Apple Currency as we speak. That can only be ran on Macs.

What happened today was the opposite of a melt down. BTC melted up in the usa. There was more demand than the market and current infrastructure could support. It's really amazing and tells me you better get in. This will not end soon but it will be very volatile.

Now and later scale into it. As a veteran stock broker from the internetwork era no one has any idea were it's going. Its all emotion. However if it works it's going a lot higger.

There is also per pressure such an example would be legalizing marijuana. If you hold your people back to much you will suffer in the long run. Say what you want but the internet brought down the bs we were feed about Marijuana and it will bring down many other things. The government is not changing marijuana prohibition the people are. There is a change going on right now with internet and peoples privacy that the government can not stop. It is evolving as we speak.
