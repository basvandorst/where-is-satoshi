7.5 Communication with Issuers
By electing to use Google Mobile Wallet, you authorize GPC, directly or through the Google Mobile Wallet to communicate with the issuer of your Funding Account, Payment Instrument, or Wallet Object item, to provide or obtain any information required by that issuer. An issuer that provides this information does not endorse and is not responsible for Google Mobile Wallet.
7.6 Third Party Providers
GPC may have arranged for third party providers to provide products or services to you through the Google Mobile Wallet ("Third Party Providers"). In order to use these products or services, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions from those Third Party Providers, and may be subject to additional requirements of the Third Party Provider. By agreeing to these Terms of Service or continuing to use the Google Mobile Wallet, you hereby agree to any Third Party Provider terms that apply to your use of such products and services through Google Mobile Wallet which may be updated from time to time. For avoidance of doubt, these Third Party Provider terms are between you and the applicable Third Party Provider, not GPC.
7.7 Advertising
Some of the features of Google Mobile Wallet may be supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions. In consideration for GPC granting you access to and use of Google Mobile Wallet, you agree that GPC may place such advertising. In addition, you may have the choice to opt-in to allowing information from Google Mobile Wallet to be used by GPC and Google, in order to present you with more relevant advertising, as well as more relevant items for you to store and/or redeem as Wallet Objects.

None of the Google Wallet Virtual Card nor the Google Wallet Online Card is a credit card, and GPC and Bancorp are not extending credit in connection with your use of the Google Wallet Virtual Card or the Google Wallet Online Card.
7.10 No Relationship with Issuer of Payment Instruments
Use of the Google Mobile Wallet Service is not approved by, or offered in conjunction with the issuer of your Funding Account or Payment Instrument.

6 - Google Wallet Balance, Peer to Peer Payments and the Google Wallet Card
6.1 Google Wallet Balance
(a) Creating Google Wallet Balance. You may maintain funds in your Google Wallet Account, and such funds will be known as your Google Wallet Balance. To create a Google Wallet Balance, you will first be asked to provide certain registration information, as described in Section 2 above.
Funds can be accumulated in your Google Wallet Balance by means of: (i) a transfer of funds from a Funding Account; (ii) funds received from a Sender; and / or, (iii) a credit issued to you in accordance with the terms of the Google Wallet Balance Customer Service and Error Resolution Policy, or as a courtesy by GPC or Google. We can institute limits on amounts you can add to your Wallet Balance using your Funding Accounts in our discretion and without notice. GPC will use commercially reasonable efforts to make funds available to you no later than three (3) business days after GPC receives final settlement of the funding transaction.
For any transfer from a Funding Account which is a credit card, if your credit card issuer deems your addition of funds to your Google Wallet Balance to be a cash advance transaction or a similar non-purchase transaction, you may incur cash advance or similar fees assessed by your credit card issuer. Please refer to your agreement with your Funding Account provider for information on whether cash advance fees may be incurred.
All Google Wallet Balances will be maintained in a deposit account at a Partner Bank. GPC is not a bank and does not accept deposits or maintain deposit obligations for you. Funds held by GPC or its service providers, including Google Wallet Balances and other funds relating to the P2P service, are not deposit obligations of users and are not insured for the benefit of users by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") or any other governmental agency.
(b) Withdrawal of Google Wallet Balances. You may register an ACH-enabled checking or savings account as the Funding Account for your Google Wallet Balance in order to withdraw funds from your Google Wallet Balance. If you are permitted by GPC to withdraw funds to a bank account, you must be the named account-holder of both the Google Wallet Balance and the bank account to which funds are withdrawn, or the withdrawal will not be processed. You can also withdraw funds in the form of cash at certain automatic teller machines, via over the counter transactions, and via point of sale transactions with the use of the Google Wallet Card. Withdrawals may be processed in part by third parties (such as your account-holding bank). We are not responsible for withdrawn funds once provided to the third party for delivery to you at your request or upon distribution of your Google Wallet Balance to you in cash. You are solely responsible for any fees that may be charged to you by a third party for processing a withdrawal. GPC will not be responsible for withdrawals provided to the wrong party or account, or where you provided incorrect withdrawal account details to GPC.
(c) Use of Google Wallet Balances. You may use your available Google Wallet Balance for P2P Payments, Payment Transactions on Google Play, in-store payments using the Google Mobile Wallet, to make point of sale transactions using a Google Wallet Card or the Google Wallet application if you have mobile device with an NFC chip, and withdrawals as described in Section 6.1(b) above.
(d) Limits. No transaction using your Google Wallet Balance, including with your Google Wallet Card or any P2P transfer, may exceed Ten-Thousand Dollars ($10,000) as an individual transaction or Fifty-Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in aggregate transactions over five (5) days. The Google Wallet Card has a maximum spending limit of $5,000 per 24 hour period, and a cash withdrawal limit at ATMs which you can see in your Google Wallet application. GPC or the Partner Bank may impose additional limitations on the dollar amount or frequency of any withdrawals permitted; these limitations are subject to change.
(e) No Interest On Google Wallet Balances. GPC and the Partner Bank do not pay interest to you on Google Wallet Balances or any other funds. You assign to GPC the right to earn interest on funds in the deposit account of the Partner Bank, in consideration of your use of the Service.
(f) Negative Google Wallet Balances. If for any reason, your Google Wallet Balance becomes negative, you authorize GPC to:
i. Initiate a debit or charge to your Funding Accounts in your Google Wallet Account to bring your Google Wallet Balance to $0 and / or
ii. Use a third party to recover funds from you to bring your Google Wallet Balance to $0.
Your authorizations under this Section 6.1(f) remain in effect while you are a Customer and for a period of ninety (90) days following termination or cancellation of the Services.
(g) Liability for Failure to Make Transactions. We may restrict access to your Google Wallet Balance, including transactions using your Google Wallet Card, Google Wallet Virtual Card, or Google Wallet Online Cards, temporarily or permanently, if we notice suspicious activity in connection with your Google Wallet Balance account. We have no liability for restricting access to the Google Wallet Balance because of suspected suspicious activity. If we do not complete a transaction using your Google Wallet Balance on time or in the correct amount according to our Agreement with you (other than for restrictions because of suspicious activity), we will be liable for the correct amount of the transfer. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:
•	If through no fault of ours, a merchant refuses to honor a transaction using your Google Wallet Balance;
•	If through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money available in your Google Wallet Balance to make a purchase;
•	If the terminal or system was not working properly;
•	If the transaction information supplied by you or a third party is incorrect or untimely;
•	If circumstances beyond our control (such as flood or fire) prevent a transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken; or The merchant authorizes an amount greater than the purchase amount.
In addition, we will also not be liable for Google Wallet Card transactions in the following circumstances:
•	If the Google Wallet Card is expired, damaged or revoked; or
•	If the Google Wallet Card has been reported lost or stolen, or we have reason to believe that the Google Wallet Card has been stolen.
There may be other applicable exceptions as otherwise provided by state or federal laws.

7 . Use of Services
7.1 Limitations
Notwithstanding any limitations described elsewhere in this Agreement, we may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Services, including without limitation individual or aggregate transaction limits on the dollar amount or number of transactions during any specified time period(s). We reserve the right to change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time, including hours of operation or availability of the Services or any Service feature, without notice and without liability. We also reserve the right to impose limits on certain Service features or restrict access to some or all of the Services without notice and without liability. We may decline to process any transaction without prior notice to you.
GPC may delay, hold, cancel or reverse processing of any transaction if:
(a) a Sender makes a claim to GPC for a refund or other reversal, or
(b) GPC, in its sole discretion, believes that the transaction is invalid, suspicious, involves misconduct or fraud, or otherwise violates Applicable Law, this Agreement, or any applicable GPC or Google policies.
Buyer authorizes the charge or debit to Buyer's Payment Instrument, by GPC as agent of the Seller, as necessary to complete processing of a Payment Transaction. Buyer also authorizes the crediting or debiting, as applicable, to Buyer's Payment Instrument, by GPC as agent of the Seller, in connection with chargebacks, reversals, refunds, or adjustments through the Service by a Seller.
We may limit or suspend your use of one or more Services at any time, in our sole and absolute discretion. If we suspend your use of a Service, we will attempt to notify you by electronic mail. Suspension of your use of a Service will not affect your rights and obligations pursuant to these Terms of Service arising before or after such suspension or with respect to any non-terminated Services.
The Google Mobile Wallet is intended for use on mobile devices, Android operating systems, or other devices or operating systems approved by Google, as provided to you directly by Google or your mobile carrier. You are strictly prohibited from using the Google Mobile Wallet on a mobile device or Android operating system, or other device or operating system approved by Google, that has been modified or customized in any way. You bear sole responsibility for such unauthorized use of the Google Mobile Wallet on a modified mobile device, Android operating system, or other device or operating system approved by Google.
7.2 Fraud
If you believe your Google Wallet Account has been opened or used in an unauthorized manner, please see our fraud protection process. Also, please see our Help Center for more information on how GPC protects you from fraud.
7.3 Unclaimed Property
If GPC is holding funds due to you arising from a Payment Transaction processed using any service described herein, and GPC is unable to contact you and has no record of your use of the service for several years, Applicable Law may require GPC to report these funds as unclaimed property. If this occurs, GPC will try to locate you at the address shown in our records, but if GPC is unable to locate you, it may be required to deliver any such funds to the applicable state as unclaimed property. GPC reserves the right to deduct a dormancy fee or other administrative charges from such unclaimed funds, as permitted by Applicable Law.
7.4 GPC Not a Banking Institution, Issuer, or Processor
GPC is not a bank or other chartered depository institution. GPC is not an issuer of any Funding Account, Payment Instrument or other item stored as a Wallet Object, unless expressly stated otherwise. With respect to Google Mobile Wallet transactions, all payment processing is handled solely by the merchant, and GPC is not involved in the merchant's processing of the payment. For Payment Transactions facilitated with the Google Wallet Virtual Card or the Google Wallet Online Cards that do not involve the Wallet Balance, GPC handles the payment to the merchant and the charging of your registered credit or debit card to conduct your payment for the purchase.
With respect to the Processing Service, GPC processes Payment Transactions through the Processing Service as an agent of and on behalf of Sellers. Funds held by GPC or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of Payment Transactions are not deposit obligations of Buyer and are not insured for the benefit of Buyer by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.
These Terms of Service do not amend or otherwise modify your agreement with the issuer of your Funding Account or Payment Instrument or redeemable Wallet Object item, and you are responsible for ensuring your use of the Google Wallet complies with such agreements. You also are responsible for all charges and/or debits to your Funding Account or Payment Instrument resulting from purchases of Products or redemptions of items stored as Wallet Objects using the Google Mobile Wallet, in accordance with such agreements. In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms of Service and your agreement with the issuer of your Funding Account, Payment Instrument or redeemable Wallet Object item, these Terms of Service govern the relationship between you and GPC solely with respect to Google Wallet, and your agreement with the issuer of your Funding Account, Payment Instrument or Wallet Object item governs the relationship between you and the issuer of such item. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the Funding Account Payment Instrument or Wallet Object item, and any other information you enter or otherwise store in the Google Mobile Wallet. GPC is not responsible for the accuracy or availability of any information you enter or otherwise store in with Google Wallet, including, without limitation, whether such information is current and up-to-date.

this might be helpful in making some questions: 
few questions:
-- What was the first car purchased with BTC?
-- Why should you keep your bitcoins in cold storage?
And one for the long term experts:
If Amy had 5 bitcoins and Jerry had 900000 Dogecoins, how many ounces of black tar heroine could they have purchased one week prior to the fed shutdown of Silk Road?

The P2P Service is currently available only to Senders and Recipients who are U.S. residents and who otherwise meet the requirements of these Terms of Service.

(i) For a P2P Payment made from your Google Wallet Balance, debit funds in the P2P Payment amount from your Google Wallet Balance;
(ii) For a Funding Account that is credit or debit card, initiate a charge through the applicable payment network in the P2P Payment amount; and,
(iii) For a Funding Account that is an ACH-enabled checking or savings account, initiate a debit through the ACH Network in the P2P Payment amount; and
(iv) Initiate any subsequent credit, debit or charge to your Funding Account or Google Wallet Balance in order to process a return, chargeback, reversal, refund, adjustment or rejection, to correct an error relating to, or to resubmit a P2P Payment.

6.3 Processing of P2P Payments
(a) You may send a P2P Payment to any other person who is a resident of the United States with a valid email address who otherwise meets the requirements of the Google Wallet Terms of Service to receive such P2P Payment. You must select the Funding Account or your Google Wallet Balance from which your P2P Payment will be sent at the time you initiate the P2P Payment.
(b) In the event you initiate a P2P Payment from your Google Wallet Balance and there are insufficient funds for the P2P Payment, your Google Wallet Balance may be debited in the amount of the insufficient funds. In the event your Google Wallet Balance incurs a negative balance as a result of this debit, your Funding Accounts will be debited in the order listed in your Google Wallet Account to bring your Google Wallet Balance to $0 (as described in Section 6.2(a) above).
(c) In the event your credit card issuer deems your P2P Payment to be a cash advance transaction or a similar non-purchase transaction, you may incur cash advance or similar fees assessed by your credit card issuer. Please refer to your agreement with your Funding Account provider for information on whether cash advance fees may be incurred.
(d) GPC will hold funds debited from a Sender's Funding Account or Google Wallet Balance pending transfer to the Recipient. You will not have access to funds in the process of transmission to the Recipient.

(f) The Recipient must either have or create a Google Wallet Account AND complete the steps required to hold a Google Wallet Balance in order for the funds to become available to him or her. A Recipient may be required to take certain actions, such as providing Google Wallet with additional registration information, or accepting the Google Wallet Terms of Service, prior to the funds becoming available. GPC is not responsible if the intended Recipient does not have or create such accounts to receive a P2P Payment.
(g) A requested P2P Payment is complete when funds are credited to the Recipient's Google Wallet Balance and are available for use or withdrawal by the Recipient. The Sender may request that GPC cancel the P2P Payment prior to GPC making the funds available to the Recipient in the Recipient's Google Wallet Balance, as described in our Customer Service &amp; Error Resolution Policy. The Sender may request cancellation of the P2P Payment by calling GPC at 1-855-492-5538. GPC will use commercially reasonable efforts to cancel the P2P Payment upon request by the Sender. In the event that GPC is able to cancel the P2P Payment, the funds will be credited to the Sender's Funding Account, or Google Wallet Balance, that was used to fund the P2P Payment. GPC may deduct applicable fees from the returned funds, to the extent permitted by applicable law. P2P Payments that have been completed (funds have been credited to the Recipient's Google Wallet Balance and are available for use or withdrawal by the Recipient) are ineligible for cancellation.
(h) GPC reserves the right (but is not obligated) to make funds available to a Recipient before GPC receives final settlement of the Sender's funding transaction.

6.4 Using Gmail to Initiate P2P Payments
If you have a Gmail account as part of your Google Account, you may initiate a P2P Payment through the Gmail account interface. However, although you are using Gmail to access your Google Wallet Account, you may be asked to provide login information for Google Wallet in order to initiate such P2P Payment.
To access the Google Wallet P2P Payment feature from Gmail, you must click on the $ icon in the Gmail email message. You must follow the steps in the Google Wallet/Gmail interface to identify the email address of the Recipient, the P2P Payment amount, and the Google Wallet Balance or the Funding Account for the P2P Payment. You may enter only one Recipient email address as the Recipient of the P2P Payment. You will also have the option to enter a "memo" or note for the P2P Payment, which may be retained by GPC as part of the P2P Payment record.
Upon confirmation of the P2P Payment by you, the P2P Payment will be processed by Google Wallet, and the Recipient will receive the email message you sent via Gmail, providing information to him or her about the P2P Payment. P2P Payments initiated through Gmail are subject to the same terms of this agreement as all other P2P Payments, and the Recipient must take the same steps to access the funds as for any other P2P Payment.
In the event that you have created a Google+ profile that includes your photo(s), such photo(s) may be visible to Senders and Recipients and included in your email message. You may limit the sharing of your photos by changing the settings of your Google+ profile in your Google+ account.
The text of Gmail email messages for P2P Payments, any accompanying photo(s), and any other attachments, data, or information included in such messages (other than that discussed above), are not considered part of P2P Payments processed by GPC. Your use of Gmail and Google+ are subject to the terms of service and policies of those individual products.
P2P Payments initiated through Gmail are offered as part of Google Wallet by GPC under the terms of this agreement. Gmail and Google+ are offered under the terms of your agreement for those services with Google Inc.

6.5 Google Wallet Card
(a) Issuance of the Google Wallet Card. GPC may arrange for Bancorp to provide you with access to a MasterCard branded physical debit payment card, the Google Wallet Card. By using the Google Wallet Card, you also agree to the Google Wallet Card Terms of Use, which may be updated from time to time. For avoidance of doubt, the Google Wallet Card Terms of Use are between you and Bancorp, not Google or GPC.
(b) Using the Google Wallet Card. The Google Wallet Card is a debit card that can be used to make purchases with a merchant or cash withdrawals, in each case, using any available amounts in your Google Wallet Balance.
(c) Payment Transaction Limits. You can only make transactions using the Google Wallet Card to the extent that you have Google Wallet Balance to support those transactions. Therefore, you should know the amount available in your Google Wallet Balance to use the Google Wallet Card. You agree not to make a purchase or other transaction in excess of your Google Wallet Balance. If you do make a purchase or other transaction that exceeds the balance available in your Google Wallet Balance, you agree that we can recover any negative balance incurred as indicated in Section 6.1(f).
If you have zero or negative Google Wallet Balance, any subsequent transaction authorizations using your Google Wallet Balance will be declined. Any transaction attempted for more than the amount available in your Google Wallet Balance may be declined if that merchant does not accept more than one form of payment. Certain merchants, such as restaurants and hotels, may factor in a tip of 20% or more on your purchase amount when authorizing a transaction. If your bill plus the factored tip is greater than your Google Wallet Balance, then your purchase will be declined. This factored tip will be held against your Google Wallet Balance until the actual purchase and tip amount posts to your Google Wallet Balance account. In addition, the transaction limits set forth in Section 6.1(d) also apply to your use of the Google Wallet Card. GPC may also set forth addition limits on your use of the Google Wallet Card from time to time. Further, there are limits to the amounts that you may withdraw at an ATM, a point of sale cash withdrawal, or over the counter. Please review the limits communicated to you in your Google Wallet application or in your account online.
(d) ATM Access. You can set a PIN number for the Google Wallet Card using your Google Wallet application. You may use your Card and PIN to access cash via a participating Automatic Teller Machine ("ATM"). Do not write or keep your PIN with your Google Wallet Card. If you believe your PIN has been compromised, please immediately contact the Customer Service Number. To get cash, use the "withdrawal from checking" option at an ATM. Acceptance within ATM Networks may change at any time. Use of the Card at ATMs is subject to all applicable fees, surcharges, rules and customs of any clearinghouse, ATM network, or other institution or association involved with the transaction. We may impose a fee each time a Card is used to obtain cash or any other services from an ATM, as set forth in the Section 6.7. The owner of the ATM may impose a fee in addition to any fee charged by us. The ATM owner must disclose any fee(s) they charge prior to your confirming the transaction.
(e) No Cash Value. The Google Wallet Card is not redeemable for cash or other cards, and cannot be resold, exchanged or transferred for value, except as required by law. GPC disclaims all express or implied warranties as to the physical Google Wallet Card. Except as otherwise set forth herein or required by applicable law, GPC is not responsible if your Google Wallet Card is lost, stolen, destroyed, or used without your permission.
(f) Illegal Activity. The Google Wallet Card may not be used for any illegal activity. You agree not to use the Google Wallet Card for Internet gambling, whether or not internet gambling is illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located. You are liable for transactions you initiate by the use of the Card, whether deemed legal or illegal.
(g) No Right to Stop Payment. You do not have the right to stop payment on a transaction originated with the Google Wallet Card. You are responsible for all authorized transactions initiated by use of the Google Wallet Card.
6.6 Transaction Records, Customer Service and Error Resolution Policy
Records of your P2P Payments through the P2P Service, transactions using your Google Wallet Card and your other Google Wallet Balance transactions (together, your "Google Wallet Balance Transactions") will be reflected in your transaction history in your Google Wallet Account. In addition, you will be provided with a monthly statement of your Google Wallet Balance Transactions in your Google Wallet Account.

Take a look at the code here...
I'm uncertain on how to do it with a Google Doc... but you can use Excel and run it via VBA.  Look on the github in "Main Code" under Sub ReadSite()...  I was pulling my price from bitcoinity and looking for what they labeled in the HTML code as "last_price".
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:53:59
Wow, so cool :) 
@_date: 2016-06-06 16:15:36
here's the github code to the original excel:

Everyone talked about it over Thanksgiving and now the purchases are happening 
@_date: 2016-05-30 11:25:18
Wow... Looks like someone took my BTCalc spreadsheet and ran with it :) nice to see 
@_date: 2016-05-30 16:14:50
The original used vba to pull it from bitcoinity and updated the price as requested by the user or on a specified time interval. It also had price alerts and it would send a text message if the price hit the high or low a user specified. You had to keep the spreadsheet open and have outlook setup to have that function work. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:28:42
**NOTE!! When you click on the link, DOWNLOAD the sheet.**
*It has VBA built-in and will not work with google sheets.*  
     
      
I received multiple messages requesting I release this again so I figured I'd put it back out there with the minor improvements I've made.  If you wish to donate to motivate further updates, I've included a BTC address in the spreadsheet.  If not, simply enjoy it.
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:24:15
You can reset it but it takes 24 hrs and you get a series of 4 text messages and emails to make sure you agreed to it. I had to do it recently.

I'll step in and cover the additional cost of shipping so it stays at $15.  Want to help her out since she just quit her nasty corporate job a few weeks back and is trying to get into something she loves.
Just added international shipping to the website! :) Thanks!

If you want to order with bitcoin, just mark your payment choice to other and a request for funds will be sent to your email.  Pretty exciting stuff! She just got her first bitcoin sale not too long ago... Hope you guys like her stuff!

oh.... yikes didn't know that.  I wanted to let people know about the 25% off deal for bitcoin cyber monday. :/  I also wanted to give her shop some attention because she recently quit her crappy corporate job and is putting her heart into something she loves.  I'm sorry I didn't see that statement and will no longer post these.  I just got caught up in the sale frenzy and wanted to bring a smile to my wife's face by helping her out.
FYI - note to future bitcoin businesses: i'm trying to get posts like this one a home, lets post them to Also, for those redditors looking for 100% serious bitcoin news, I came across You can avoid all the memes and price alerts there.  It's nice for those serious business times.

Moved to text thread: 
Right now its set up for bitstamp, but I can add additional exchanges if the demand is there. 
**Latest version: [BTCalc v13.12.6.6](
13.12.6.6 - Removed all security now fully open source and updated calculator (done for tonight, will update if there are more requests)
13.12.6.5 - Removed the security on the visual basic code per popular demand. Enjoy!
13.12.6.4 - Opened up window size modification that was accidentally locked down as pointed out by 13.12.6.3 - finished current value override as requested by 13.12.6.2 - Added adjustable sell for % and override for current value (in calculator only right now, will add override functionality for full spreadsheet as well) requested by 13.12.6 - Allowed override to coinbase fee and the bank fee (in case these don't apply)

i've opened up the VBA code... download the latest version and check it out... i ran around the internet to get it to work... it was exhausting, but totally worth it. :)

Keep working on this! I think it's pretty neat and could be a very useful tool!

it would be nice to have a subreddit for those... something like or something more creative
haha... i just realized that is already a subreddit. cool.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:10:08
Also, you might want to consider an easier to use sorting method...  the search bar is nice, but maybe have the vendors select a business type when they submit, then use a drop down or something.
p.s. your downvote button is a thumbs up (i'm sure you're aware of that) also it would be nice to be able to edit postings by owner or report broken links.
I'm passing your site onto other vendors that I know.

is there a quick way to upload an excel file?  I'm too busy at the moment to fully dive into github, but i'm trying to get it up there.  Should I just post the vba code?  Cause it utilizes the spreadsheet capabilities that excel offers.

oh $1 in BTC... not 1 BTC. :) you confused me there.  I even typed it the same but still was thinking a full bitcoin per share.

I just found this: 
it's a new resource being worked on by a fellow redditor.
also, $1BTC per share?  wow... 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:10:22
ok, i got the current value part all integrated

I hope with all this hype, everyone is keeping their head on straight! Don't think of this as a get rich quick scheme! Don't overextend yourself on the hopes that you'll make it rich, but, if you can afford to collect some of this limited resource, buy with your heart... This is the future!  It'll likely bring its reward in wealth, but it's also going to strike some change... It's going to be an interesting ride fellas! As McDonald's would say... I'm lovin' it!
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:31:27
The only way I found was to set the payment options to other. I then send a pay request using coinbase to the provided email address. Wish it was incorporated into etsy, but at least we can accept bitcoin this way

yeah, i didn't notice that clause was over there... This will be my last post of this nature.  I didn't intend to annoy, but rather just announce an even deeper sale than was done on friday.  I was trying to further reward and share a bitcoin vendor's excitement... That and be a hero to my wife.

reading it... thank you! I think this would be great modified into a sidebar link... also a brief write up on cold non-paper storage (essentially the steps listed in this tutorial but instead of printing, you keep it on a computer disconnected from the internet).  I assume posts like this one will start showing up a lot and it'd be nice to direct everyone to the sidebar.
Thanks again!

@_date: 2013-12-02 19:49:58
yeah, this will be my last post to this regard... I've discussed with others and will be pushing vendors to post their offerings in that way it allows a place for posts like these if people are interested, yet it keeps it out of the bitcoin mainstream... 
also, if you want a place thats 100% serious bitcoin, I suggest checking out I like it when I want to avoid the memes and price alerts that tend to frequent here.

@_date: 2013-12-06 21:29:26
the calculator is used when purchasing... basically i set it up so i could see if i bought at 800 what i'd need to sell at to pay the coinbase and bank fees to get the money i put in.  The sell for 20% gain is based off the price you bought it at... 
i can set up another calculator that is based off your current stash of bitcoins and allows you to determine what i think you're looking for.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:38:01
Yeah the one with your wallet is probably the best :) maybe swap out the O for the moon guy...
