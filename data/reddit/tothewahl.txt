Keep an eye on Charity Water. 100% of donations go straight to creating wells for those drinking swampy green water in Africa to drink clean fresh water. The charity is well managed and worth taking a look into!

Though this is a seemingly advanced and secure setup, it doesn't sound like something that would help newcomers, just confuses them more.

That's good marketing though, think about Sam's Club, Costco, or most bug businesses like Uber... they all give free samples in hopes to bring in customers and remember drug pushers were the first to use bitcoin so does that make bitcoin bad?

It's made for accredited investors ($200,000 p/ETF) where Winklevoss was for retail investors ($20-25 p/ETF). That's just one point though, there are a couple others that I don't remember atm.

As good of a time as any. HODL for lyfe
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:24:17
Around popular prices ie, 1000, 4000, 5000, and this time $10,000 many people will try and sell their bitcoin for whatever reason. All the accumulated sells at a certain price point, if there's enough, create a sell wall where the price is held constant until there are enough people to buy through the wall.

That's likely regarding the top of your peers. At my college campus you'll see these things are still going on.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:28:53
This just happened to me, how do we make sure we're secure and clean out the virus?
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:02:17
Shouldn't those who visited the site get a percentage of the mined coin. Even if it's .007? Otherwise wouldn't that be stealing
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:21:53
Thanks for the help and it was half a bitcoin worth, luckily I have some stored on a hardware wallet! I'm in college so while it's a lot for me it's still recoverable and nothing compared to other stories I've heard.

This just happened to me as well, how did you clean out the virus and get things back to normal?
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:37:26
It doesn't which is what sucks.

I bought when it hit ATH of 3100 then crashed in low 2's. What I learned: dont buy into alts off of what anyone says, I have figured that it takes a good 4-6 months of being deep in the crypto space to start understanding things at that level. Best bet is to buy and HODL, then buy some more.
@_date: 2018-11-11 00:26:00
And the other 2% is made up 100% of the time.
