I'm developing a code that can learn the cryptography of lost and inactive keys and "mine" the coin that's in them....I just need $1,000,000 to build my team and start my work, so feel free to donate to my ICO I'm launching soon.

Binance mainly. That and Tether

Considering almost everyone has a FB....yes, they're in fact all "dumb fucks"

I think the announcement of Libra was timed with the Tether news which might alleviate some of the movement should a collapse ensue. We’ll see once we find out which exchanges won’t trade it.

which makes 6 easier to implement.

Maybe this is all just a ploy to try and widdle the real Satoshi out of hiding......or just a ploy to widdle money out of the uneducated hopefuls.

A lot of profits were taken at the last ATH. This was built over a long while from a dedicated core base, many of which who missed the previous ATH, and now it was their turn to cash in. This upcoming ATH will contain all of them, plus all those new FOMO buyers, plus the immense ICO bubblers, and plus LARGE institutional backing. Not too mention, another halving on the horizon. I don't think we're going to see 18k for very long, and a much more explosive boom seems more imminent. Imagine the amount of wealth some of these whales will accumulate once we see those types of prices.
