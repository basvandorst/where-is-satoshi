People said the same about MtGox months before it collapsed.  The majority never listens to the minority.

I've considered becoming a cash trader on LBC.  My one problem is that I'm fairly nervous about meeting someone to complete a cash transaction.  Do you ever have these concerns?
If you do, how do you mitigate them?  
Please feel free to respond in PM if necessary.

Thank you!  Nitrogen Sports has Belmont wagering.

I'm going to be in Greece at the end of August.  Is this deal still available?

This is not the case at all. I am the assistant controller for a large hospitality management company and these costs are not built into the food prices. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:23:23
You mean my personal experience with many companies. I didnt just get here by accident. These costs don't factor into pricing as much as you would think. Additionally, there is no reason for management to build it into price. It's not a cost against revenue. Tips Payable are a liability.

Thanks. I hope it comes up soon.

This one is much better than Google Finance as I can add API for ShareBuilder and it updates all my holdings and positions automatically.

Yes. We did have a phone call and the bitcoin was paid out. 
Everyone works hard. Well, most of us do. I completely understand if you needed a weekend off. What angered me was that you lied about turning on my miner. You know the stakes in this business.  If you were up front and honest from the beginning, we wouldn't be where we are now. 
Thankfully, you do care about your business and reputation.  I am happy that you have been communicative and are interested in making things right.  I await my miner and I belive it will arrive on time as you have said. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:17:48
Agreed!  I got into BTC during the November rise and I already heard rumblings about staying away from Gox. I just can't understand why folks continued to put their money into that exchange when others were complaining they couldn't get it out.

ZoomHash was shady to me the other day as well. I ordered on of the 28.4 MH A2 miners. After being assured it would ship on Friday, I received a phone call from Mike, claiming to be the owner of ZoomHash. 
Mike said he was concerned about delays during Memorial Day weekend with USPS and instead offered to turn my miner on and point it at my pool for the weekend.  This was Friday and he said he "would turn it on tomorrow."  He would then ship it on Tuesday.  I thought this was a great solution. 
On Saturday, my pool still did not show the additional hash. Additionally, I called Mike early on Saturday to ask when it would be hooked up.  He said he would turn it on later when he got to work. At 8pm on Saturday, after a full 24 hours from the original phone call, my miner was still not on. Mike, the purported CEO had lied. 
I called him up, livid, and after calling him out for lying, he put .3 BTC in my wallet for the hashing power lost over the weekend. I could have probably asked for more, but once I receive this miner, I'm done buying miners for a while.

I'm happy this guy is invested in bitcoin, but the article is poorly written. He goes off on tangents in some parts, and there are grammatical errors all over.

Unless the miners support the SegWit USAF this will not end well.

Correct, but that requires your merchants accepting BTC as well.
I work for a large hospitality management company, and while I want to approach our superior to suggest accepting BTC for our Coffee Shop concept, it does not yet seem viable.  The biggest hurdles I can see are:
* Cash Flow for restaurants/food service needs to be extremely fluid.  
* If you are an established business, you are paying vendors weekly and we cannot afford to have our money tied up in pending btc --&gt; usd transactions
* Same applies for employee payroll.

Why do you say that?  Fingerprints have been touted for years as unique secure identifiers.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:47:28
Here's an example, I want to send my BTC to someone else using my mobile wallet.  In order to authorize the transaction, I have to hold my fingerprint and then swipe in a particular gesture I set.  The transaction cannot be sent otherwise.  
Can you explain to me the flaws in this level of security?  You seem to know how broken fingerprint security is, but you don't provide any backup and/or examples.  I'm not saying you're wrong, I just want to know why you're right.

I had this same idea walking through target yesterday!!  I wanted a bottle of water whilr shopping and wondered to myself how great it would be if I could scan a QR on the bottle and purchase it right off the shelf.

The nore hands BTC gets in, the faster it will stabilize. The market fluctuated because the majority of large BTC holders saw an opportunity to get rich quick. Now even if somone sells off 1000 BTC ($1,000,000) it will not have as much an effect on the price as it would have when BTC was at $30 or $140. 
This post is one of the most sensical things I've read in a while, but the assumption that the chinese are not speculative is questionable. If, like OP says, the chinese, who apparently hold a lot of BTC, reach a greater threshold, they may sell off a lot of coins, which will cause the market price to fluctuate. 
The upside is that as the price grows before this bubble pops, the BTC will see more buyers and that will get it into the hands of more people. This is exactly the scenario we want if the bubble should pop, because then more people will buy in at the drop, expanding BTC popularity and use. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:08:04
I think the power in "buying in" now is that in the future when BTC has greater spending power, your dollars today will go farther as BTCs tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:04:02
But this requires the thief to be in the same room as you.  Same security level as paper wallet.  I'm concerned about remote theft.  If I lose my phone with my BTC info on it, that's on me.

I bought at 700 and 1000. I'm still confident I made the right decision.

What about loading the machine? The insurance for the armored trucks and the cash deliveries must be paid. Additionally, doesn't the owner of the ATM have to guarantee the funding of the ATM.  OP didn't really think this through.

Where do you exchange your $20 for BTC?  At small increments like that, Coinbase inflates the BTC price to cover the bank tx fee.

Avoiding tax is illegal and most businesses would not risk their livelihood for any minimal tax savings.  Plus, it's incredibly hard to get away with it.  
Running most businesses requires a steady cash flow. If you are accepting btc for some of your transactions, you're going to have to eventually convert those btc into USD in order to deal with other merchants. The govt is going to ask where that extra cash is coming from. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:48:08
I'm not talking about income tax.  I'm talking about sales and use tax.  In NY, restaurant businesses must pay sales and use tax on a monthly basis.  This number is based on your total sales for the month.  You cannot hide them from the POS system if you are accepting sales via Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:44:08
Fair enough.  But now we are back at the original problem, being the security of the mobile wallet.  Unless there is a foolproof way of securing someone's bitcoins, it makes bitcoins far less liquid than claimed.
