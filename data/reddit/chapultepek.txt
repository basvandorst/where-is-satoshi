I do seriously suspect BitPay is moving towards this, and may even call it "bitcoin." If so, they're bad actors and the sooner we amputate the better. Losing BitPay is going to set back "merchant adoption" tremendously.
And KFC doesn't know the difference between bitcoin, bcash and other bjokes.

Multiple times in the past two weeks I was sent to BitPay to pay an invoice. In the past this meant I got an address, an amount of bitcoins to send to that address, and a timer.  These recent times I instead got a url like
where the randomcode is not a bitcoin address. There was a link with a question like, "how do I pay this when there is no address?" I followed the link and it said I needed to use a special kind of wallet, like the one provided by BitPay. One of those times it was for a payment over $150. In every case I gave up and contacted the vendor to cancel the purchase.
The good news is that one of those vendors added an alternative way to pay in bitcoin (or other alts) using a different payment processor to BitPay, so not only are there alternatives to BitPay ("coingate" in this case), BitPay is helping drive business to those alternatives.
I do suspect there will be a lot of confusion if BitPay starts using Bcash instead of Bitcoin, and calling Bcash Bitcoin. And I strongly suspect that's where we're heading. Same with Coinbase. It's better if the Bitcoin community shuns those companies in advance.

Thanks for pointing this out. I'm wondering why there's not more discussion of the fact that bitcoin payments via BitPay are impossible from traditional bitcoin wallets.
For those who haven't experience it, in the past BitPay gave a bitcoin address, an amount to pay and a stress inducing timer. Now they give an indecipherable code, along with a link that says "hey, if you don't know how to pay this, you should switch to using our wallet."
Something's going on with BitPay, but I guess most people want to ignore it for now.

It's BitPay. They barely accept Bitcoin now (you have to pay with their wallet software), and they probably won't accept Bitcoin much longer.

Many bitcoiners have been surprised to learn that Bitcoin has a president, at least in its Unlimited variety. Upon learning this, many have assumed that president must be Roger Ver. In fact, the President of Bitcoin is Andrew Clifford. You can learn more about him in the following interview:
In short, Andrew Clifford is a supporter of Hard Buxit, and adamant that *Buxit means Buxit*. He will Make Bitcoin Buggy Again.

Nice reference.
There really does seem to be some phenomenon where "fringe" groups at first have a common enemy, then disagree on some point, and ultimately split with a lot of animosity.
In 1980, the Libertarian Party in the US had their best results ever. By 1984, two factions of the party fought so hard there was a split. The party basically never recovered. What's happening to Bitcoin now reminds me a lot of that.

I disagree with Olivier about Bitcoin, but you might be making a mistake by pushing this quote out. Roughly speaking there are two kinds of people: (A) pro-Islam and (B) anti-Islam. Your quote will cause the people in group (A) to dislike Olivier, but it may make those in group (B) sympathetic to Olivier. The trouble is, most people in group (B) are largely forced to pretend in public to belong to group (A). People openly in group (B) get demonized, fired and sometimes even arrested or murdered. It makes me glad I'm in group (A). *Long live Mohammed! Behead the kartoonist kuffar!*
Prediction: viajero_loco's comment is acceptable, but my comment isn't. Even though mine actually *mentions* bitcoin. Why? My comment will be deemed insufficiently group (A)ish.

Not quite, but racism is an example of something someone would need to lie about in today's society (unless it's racism against white people, of course). Since Islam is a belief system, not a race, the word "racism" doesn't apply. Belief systems can be good, bad or (most common) a mixture of both. Islam is good, obviously, as can be seen by all the good it has brought to the world. National Socialism is a belief system that's bad, obviously, as can be seen from all the bad it has brought to the world. Communism is an example of a belief system that's a mixture: on the one hand it led to the oppression and systematic murder of tens of millions of people worldwide; on the other hand the Communists solved the gender wage gap.
I don't think we disagree though. We seem to be on the same page about how Europe will be better after Sharia Law is implemented and people like Olivier are exterminated. In fact, I suspect we're both looking forward to it, right?

I agree, but there seems to be a double standard. In recent threads about John McAfee numerous comments were made about his sexual orientation/activities (which were talked about in a documentary about him). What's the difference between the Ver case and the McAfee case?
I get the feeling that all sexual orientations are equal, but some are more equal than others.

Serge Kovaleski is a reporter for the New York Times. He's "disabled" in the sense that he has some condition making his right hand unusable. At some point the press was calling Trump a liar about something he said. Trump found an article from years ago where Kovaleski made a similar claim. Kovaleski and the press tried to whitewash it, of course, saying the claim really wasn't so similar. In a speech, Trump was moving his hands around (as he often does) while mocking the press for pretending like they hadn't reported what they reported.
The press decided this incident was Trump mocking Serge Kovaleski's disabled hand, rather than mocking the press's disabled reporting. Meryl Streep played Kovaleski in the movie.

I was actually more or less defending Trump. I'm not sure why that didn't come across. I explicitly said "Trump was moving his hands around (as he often does) while mocking the press for pretending like they hadn't reported what they reported." Maybe my attempt at humour ("Meryl Streep played Kovaleski in the movie") made my comment confusing.
Yes, I'm not a big fan of Trump, but most of his enemies are far worse. I'm enjoying watching his enemies suffer. As long as his enemies are suffering, I wish Trump many years of success. I actually took a break from making a png calling a dumb anti-Trump anti-Core dev troll a "cuck" just to reply to this!

900 is more or less the all time high in Euros (from Nov 2013). It will be exciting if it passes this.
The Euro has lost a lot against the USD since 2013, so it makes sense that the Euro all time high would be passed first.

I've never met you, but based on your online interactions with people and the videos of your talks, you seem like someone I'd like, respect and often agree with.
Before the NYA was signed, it was very clear that most of the current Core dev team would not go along with it. I don't know how the Core dev team could've made this position clearer. If you didn't think a clear consequence of Segwit2X was firing the Core devs/changing the dev team, then you were simply mistaken. Some of the NYA signers were even explicit about the goal of firing the Core devs. It's honestly difficult for me to imagine any of the NYA signers were unaware that they were signing a document intended to fire the Core devs. You're clearly an intelligent person.
I do expect you to continue supporting the NYA. I'm not trying to change your mind. I'll be going with the current Bitcoin network rules supported by the current Core devs instead of following 2X. Is it possible we can make this divorce as painless as possible and not overly demonize the people on both sides? Avoiding a divorce (actually, *another* divorce) is clearly no longer an option.

Many European banks stopped taking American customers after FATCA was passed, since FATCA requires them to report on their customers to the US government. In some cases, the required reporting might even be in conflict with the privacy laws of their own country. (FATCA is still new, so much is left to be tested.)
If I were an American moving to Europe, I'd definitely prefer bitcoin over banks.
(Incidentally, I fully support FATCA because it was passed by Democrats and signed by Obama, so opposing it would make me racist.)

Sure. Are you willing to do a 1:1 trade? We could go ahead and put an equal number of bitcoins into a 2-of-3 multisig address with some mutually agreeable escrow. After the chain split, as soon as I get a hold of some coins specific to one chain I can create a btc tx spending the btc to me and a b2x tx spending the btc to you. I sign both, you sign both, and everyone's happy. Or if one of us disappears the escrow can sign. I'm not bitcoin rich, but I could put up to, say, 2 btc into such a multisig trade. If you're actually interested, let me know.

@_date: 2017-05-17 06:20:58


I'm pro-Core and pro-Segwit. But it's a real issue that many utxos are lower than the fee required to spend them. For example, if someone has bought $1 worth of bitcoin once a week for the past 10 weeks, they might think they have about $10 worth of bitcoin. The truth is they have $0, because the fee to spend each of those 10 utxos would be approx $1.
I doubt many people are buying $1 worth of btc, but it seems like just a matter of time before the same argument works with 10 utxos worth $10 each.
