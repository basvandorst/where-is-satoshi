It's called rehypothecation and it may be the biggest scam ever. Think you own a share of Amazon?  Nope- you and maybe 5 other people own "your" share of Amazon together. Only it's not even that clear and orderly. It's more like a game of musical chairs in that there's only _n_ amount/qty of the asset that they're holding for customers and up to 5 customers may have legal claim to it. It's allowed because the bank supposedly has sufficient credit and the banks claim they need the time for "settlement".  ....Which brings me to Patrick Byrne of Overstock and tZero. It's my understanding that Patrick has been fighting against rehypothecation for a long time and is about to launch a trading platform called tZero, which is referring to "trading day plus zero" as opposed to t3 or t2 which I believe are currently the fastest settlement possible. The platform will trade tokenized US securities and if it ends up being all they've claimed then possession of the token will be possession of the security and the trade will be the settlement. At least that's how they've made it sound. 
But as for whether or not a bank holding your bitcoin could lend it out but show it to you as your "balance"- I don't see any reason they couldn't. If they need laws passed to do so they'll get them for sure. The sucker that trusts that his "balance" is there waiting for him is the one getting duped. 
But bitcoin will allow banks to prove reserves (or not) and really allow account holders to demand it.  It will be quite exciting to see how it all plays out in coming years.
