Agreed, very hasty.
Whatever is done the following should be considered...
A. Give to charity in something with this type of exposure
B. At least say the name of the thing (just a logo won't work)
C. Try to drive some of the concept
D. Simple is better than complex as pictures can be challenging 
Planning more than a couple days in advance is usually helpful.

Iridium is not fast but you can certainly make a transaction through it.
Don't try to download the blockchain unless you are prepared for a long wait!

Something like this?
Slightly changed... but intent preserved :-)

Linking to charity is an awesome idea.
That said, too much stuff will make it look crowded and poorly done.   I hacked in a QR code to the original logo.   But don't think a lot of additional words would be good.   Besides, "bitcoin accepted here" at the south pole is funny :-).
Does that work?    The QR code links you to Bitcoin 100 but could be anything that is relevant or better.

How about using the "bitcoin accepted here" logo
