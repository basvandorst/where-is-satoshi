Damn man, that's about 20k lost isn't it? Really hope that wasn't a savings you put in Bitcoin.

That's cool,  buying small amounts of something as speculative as this at low prices isn't a bad gamble, and as long as you are able to go in with the mindset that the money can be literally burned and your lifestyle won't be harmed, then it isn't much risk at all.
If it happened to go as low again, I might think about throwing a thousand or 2 at it just on the tiny offchance that it somehow exploded again.

True, bitcoin has acted more as an asset than a currency.
Also one thing is that governments won't allow it to replace fiat, given their lack of control over it.
The instrinsic value of fiat is the backing of the government that issues it, bitcoin doesn't even have that.
1 use case though is anonymous transactions, which is great for the shadier side of things, but will never become the norm due to that anonymity.

Or until you run out of fiat of course.

bitcoin doesn't provide monetary independence, as they can't control it value fluctuations.

and yet, past performance is not indicative of future performance, and its simply easier to grow from 1-10000 than it is from 10000 to 1 million.

Without spending bitcoin, bitcoin will never become a currency.
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:15:48
frankly, holdlers are bitcoin's worst enemy as a currency.
