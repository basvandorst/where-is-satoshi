Just saying, I've had Christmas cards stolen before that had maybe $20 or $40 in it, and it wasn't stolen by post employees, literally someone stealing it from my mailbox. $40 is fine but $19k is a different story.

@_date: 2017-12-18 02:25:45
It says he bought BTC at $9000 so no.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:12:56
I agree and I'm not a fan of ripple, I'm just stating a fact
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:52:45
You put the private key in a Christmas card? Better hope your mail doesn't get stolen or lost.

I've been waiting since Dec 10th for this
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:08:14
And someone random opens the card and uses the private keys?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:11:02
Except Ripple apparently
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:00:49
This is just a little dip you pussy

"Doubled his investment" is what he was going for.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:57:35
It's not, what's their address? I'll intercept the mail and deliver it to them personally :)

AK-47s are the most reliable guns in the world wtf are you talking about.
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:44:44
How would that work without internet?
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:29:08
But it will cost more to buy Monopoly money than the Venezuelan currency itself.

I know, I was mocking him I guess.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:32:24
So if he said old Jewish men, which is more accurate, would you be offended? Would he get banned from Twitter?
