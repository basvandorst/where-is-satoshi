Yup, I'm there. Just know to hodl and it'll be ok. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:25:43
This is the most panicked I've seen this sub. Just gonna close the tab and hodl. No point in selling at a loss. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:16:49
Back at 12! 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:08:19
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:20:12
you said it... who really knows. Guess that's the fun of it all.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:37:37
Psychology. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:59:33
Someone help me feel better. I'm hodling but damn. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:48:33
Anxious to see what happens tomorrow. Any guesses? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:37:53
I think the worst is over... at least I of course hope it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:36
All I know is to buy low and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:29:59
It's never too late to join the ride. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:49:35
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:04:39
Well, I either sell and lose money or hodl and possibly make a bunch. Hodling. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:17
In 7 minutes, do we think BTC will spike or drop? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:20:09
Don't forget the fees &amp; the short-term gains tax! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:01:56
Maybe an obvious question, but why do LTC, ETH &amp; BTC all tend to spike around 4AM PST / 7AM EST? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:59:03
Yup, 19.4K
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:45:07
Hard to guess. No one could have accurately predicted 2017. More than 20K. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:40:00
Yes please! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:18:47
Yup! Back up now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:42:04
GDAX! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:44:40
39% I believe! If held for less than a year. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:17:21
$10.1 to $9.2K in a second... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:17:31
Yup, there's no way I'm sleeping tonight
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:23:42
Does anyone know what just caused that drop on ETH, LTC and BTC? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:54
what app are you using for notifications? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:00:45
Buckling up 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:33:19
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:39
Hodl me. I'm scared. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:25:28
Incredibly helpful. Thank you!!!
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:23:35
I don't want to say that I'm losing hope, I fully believe and support BTC, but it is becoming harder for me to see why the price would ever spike to near $20K+ again. Maybe I need to go watch hours of talks by Andreas again. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:44:36
Guaranteed losses. I'd buy into that.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:42:43
Not something I've really thought through before. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:58:36
19 was so good. Bring back 19.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:15:19
At this point, I might sell, even with my 50% loss. It totally sucks. I also believe that we'll make a full recovery, just not for a long while. Once we hit that bottom, when it truly can't go much lower, then it's time to reinvest. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:01:17
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:46:30
Convinced me.
