First let's prove our claim for the case of figure 4.27 (case B * D * C)
Because segment AC' intersects AngleBC'C, we know that AngleBC'C &gt; AngleAC'C.  Likewise, segment BC intersects AngleACC', so AngleACC' &gt; AngleBCC'.
By the isosceles triangle found 2 posts above, we know that AngleBC'C = Angle BCC', so this gives us that AngleACC' &gt; AngleAC'C.  As I showed 3 posts above, this gives us that LengthAC' &gt; LengthAC.
We are done with this case.

Ok. I figured it out.
Refer to this figure 
First, to show that we can reduce the problem to the 2 diagrams figures 4.27 and 4.28, draw your two triangles on top of each other so that A is on top of A' and B is on top of B'.  Since AB is congruent to A'B', this is possible.  Furthermore, since AngleB &lt; AngleB' in our original two triangles, we can see that in our resulting figure that line BC lies in the interior of the angle ABC'.
There are two figures because we do not know whether or not the line segment BC will intersect AC'

That doesn't make any sense.  How would I get that unless you'd give it to me willingly?
I'd only use such a technology to upvote and downvote strangers and public figures.  There's little point in upvoting/downvoting my friends.  Facebook already lets me "like" their posts, and I can already tell them in person if they did something I liked/didn't like.  But I have no idea -how- I could identify a stranger to upvote/downvote him.  And people already use twitter &amp; facebook followers to gauge popular opinion of public figures.
If you can give me a way of identifying strangers to upvote/downvote them for their actions, then you might have something. Without it, you just have a system of voting for the most popular of your friends and public figures - which isn't very novel.  But I don't think a method of identifying strangers exists.

But you said that you wanted to keep the price fixed.  Let's say that you set it to $1 : 1 SFSRcoin.
Now let's say that for some reason very few people accept SFSRcoins.  Then, to most people, the SFSRcoin will be perceived as less valuable than $1.  People with SFSRcoins would trade them with you and you'd end up with less $s and a whole lot of these kind of useless SFSRcoins.
Let's say that SFSRcoins are a lot more useful than $s.  Then, people would trade all their $s to you for more SFSRcoins, and you'd end up with a lot of these less useful $s and no SFSRcoins.
Either way, if the perceived value of one commodity outpaces the other while you try to fix the exchange rate, you'll go bankrupt in the one commodity while gaining the less useful one.

No, the reason for there still being sales based on the price is clear.  Most sellers think the price is too high, so they're trying to make money.
But I think the risk for selling and then buying back is too high right now.  All my buy orders for the drop are already in, and if I move them, I might not time it correctly.  I could end up with a lot less btc than I hope to if the drop happens while I'm putting in an order.

Yes.  There are other limiting factors.  I do not know all the details, but the average time for the initial confirmation of a transaction will never be under 4 minutes or so.
The time it takes for you to first see the unconfirmed transaction will keep getting shorter and shorter as computers get better, but this isn't very important.  It's already under a second.

The thing that *will* protect a retailer from a double spend is to insist that all shoppers go through a trusted clearing house -- whether this is VISA, Western Union, or BestBuy's own bitcoin clearing house.
When the customer logs into his account on the clearing house and hits "buy", the clearing house sends the customer's bitcoin to the retailer via a "Green Address".  A Green Address is a public address that the retailer knows belongs to the clearing house.  As soon as the retailer first sees a transaction coming from the clearing house, he can let the customer go because the retailer can trust the clearing house to not double spend.

I think a solution is for a website to measure initial confirmation time vs transaction fee so that people can pay what they want for the speed they want.

I like it.  You should go to bitcointalk.org and see if someone knows how to make such a protocol.
Such a thing couldn't be tied directly to wealth though, but it could be its own sort of wealth.
Also, you should be aware of a pretty simple way to break the scheme.  My friend and I can just sit and upvote each other for hours and get free karma.
One way to mitigate this would be to attach the karma to the events that elicited it.  For instance, you could require that text or a recording is submitted with each change in karma, similar to how it is done on reddit (on reddit you only get changes in karma for comments and submissions)

Unfortunately, though I have some idea of the technology that makes bitcoin work, I'm not sure that it would actually make your idea possible.  Though I am thinking about it.
My problem with the idea is this: A person wants to be able to use this system to upvote and downvote other people's actions, but that other person will not be submitting their actions to the network - you will.  How do you identify who a person you meet in real life is?  I've thought of several ideas for how to potentially deal with this, but none of them would work in practice.

You want to peg a currency to a bundle of goods to create a stable value.  Yes this has been tried.
The problem is this: To do that, you must have a huge reserve of that good.  If you want to fix a currency to a bundle of fiat currencies, you must have someone willing and able to make that deal so much, so often, that everyone agrees that your price is the correct price.
When this was tried with gold : dollars, the trading value of gold eventually rose faster than the trading value of the paper dollar.  This almost bankrupted the federal reserve when people started exchanging their dollars for gold and they realized they could make some money by doing that.
So if you wanted to fix the price of SFSRCoins : (1$ + 1 Euro + 100 Yuan + whatever), then you must have a lot of SFSRCoins and a lot of those fiat currencies.  You must be very rich.  Not only that, but you must be willing to make the trade whether you think this is a good deal or a bad deal.  That might be very good for you in the short term, but in the long term, it will bankrupt you.

This doesn't actually address the event I was talking about.  I found it in a math book on algorithm analysis, not on Wikipedia, and I know not where the reference is.
Here's what the Soviet mathematicians did though:  They took the very best theories about how to central plan an economy that were supported by the Soviet government - the actually theories that the government said they were using - and they analyzed them.
They weren't using these arguments by Mises that are referenced in the Wikipedia article.  They were analyzing an actual algorithm that the Soviets were trying to use to central plan their economy.  The mathematicians found that the algorithm simply took too long to be at all useful and there was no way the government could actually be using the algorithm.

Finally, the problem asks us to show that this is an "if and only if" statement.
This means that we must prove the following statements.
If AngleB &lt; AngleB', then LengthAC &lt; LengthA'C' (already done)
If AngleB is not less than AngleB', then LengthAC is not less than LengthA'C'.  (not done yet).
We will proceed by trichotomy.  There are only 3 options for how angles can be ordered.  We can have AngleB &lt; AngleB', AngleB = AngleB', or AngleB &gt; AngleB'.  Therefore, if AngleB is not less than AngleB', we know that AngleB = AngleB' or AngleB &gt; AngleB'.
In the case that AngleB = AngleB', we have that AB = A'B', BC = B'C', and AngleB = AngleB'.  This gives us two triangles with 2 equal angles and an equal side sandwiched between.  When I was in Geometry class, we used a theorem called the "Side-Angle-Side Theorem" to prove that these two triangles are congruent.  Therefore, AC = A'C'.

Actually, I forgot about wormholes.  They don't violate causality either.  A wormhole is just a shorter-than-usual path through spacetime (though again - no evidence for their existence)
I'll try to explain why neither of these violate causality.
The only thing that violates causality are tachyons, which are hypothetical particles that travel faster than light.  If you use tachyons, you can send a reply to a signal that will arrive before the original signal was even sent, which is what we mean by "violate causality" - the effect happens before the cause.
The trick to why wormholes and warp bubbles don't break causality is that the speed of light is only constant *locally*.  No matter where you are, in a warp bubble, in a wormhole, or wherever, if you measure the speed of a light beam that is right next to you, it will -always- be 3*10^8 m/s, and it will -always- be faster than everything else next to you.  However, General Relativity allows that if you watch something far away from you, it can be moving at any speed at all.
Does that make sense?
So what we are looking for are situations where space and time are curved so that a ship, once it moves far away from the earth, will be moving faster than the light that is still on earth.  If such a ship were to pass close enough to the earth, the ship would curve and drag everything on earth along it.
Sorry, I don't know if that will make any sense to someone who doesn't already know General Relativity.

Keep in mind that when you send coins that a portion of the rest of your wallet is sent to a new address.  This often renders your old backups useless.  So backup after every transaction if you're not sure which addresses your coins are in.

You do in fact need to have a server in order to collect an anyonecanpay transaction.  You need to collect and record all the transactions as they come in and then rebroadcast the entire list of transactions once you've collected enough funds.
Fortunately, the software to do this would be very lightweight, and wallet software should support this in the future.  Unfortunately, no one supports it yet, so you'll have to get someone to program it for you.
Additionally, since sending an anyonecanpay transaction isn't supported by any wallets yet, you'll need to have payers use the command line of bitcoin-qt
Edit:  Also, you might be unaware of this, but if you are not constantly rebroadcasting the old pledges, then anyone can back out of their pledge at any time.  With the current way wallets are set up, a person is likely to do this accidentally.

This will only let the store know that the person is attempting to steal as soon as he tries a double spend.  It won't protect the store from a double spend.  You can double spend as long as the first transaction hasn't been confirmed yet.
In fact - here's an easy way to do it that will successfully let you double spend a large portion of the time.  Listening in on the network will not protect you in any way, but it will inform you that you've been robbed.
Spend Transaction: Include no transaction fee.  The retailer's client will show the transaction immediately, but few clients (except for blockchain.info) will show you that no transaction fee was included.  If the transaction is small (cost of a cup of coffee and a sandwich or so), then you can be sure that no miner will record this transaction in the blockchain within the next hour.
Now leave the store and send the same coin to your own wallet with the steal transaction.
Steal Transaction:  Send the same coin back to your wallet.  Include a sizable transaction fee.  This will ensure that this transaction will be recorded within the next few blocks, far faster than the initial spend transaction can be recorded.

If I trade in physical property, the answer is obvious because the crime took place in a physical location and police can find the person who did it.
But if I'm trading in digital property, I often will need serious investigation to find the person who did the crime.  A physical person may never even be found, but a botnet or server might be.  There are few police that go after computers instead of physical people.

That's a bit of a hard one.
If a game has a risk premium, it means that the EV of playing is better than the EV of not playing.
If your skill at poker is so much better than your friends that the EV of the game is obviously better than the buy in, then yes it would be investing for you (and gambling for your less skilled friends).  However, when your skill is approximately the same as your friends, it is difficult to say if the EV is greater than the buy in - so it is probably gambling.  Usually, when I play poker, the EV is lower than the buy in, so it's definitely gambling for me.
Playing Satoshi Dice is definitely gambling because the EV is always less than the buy in by ~1.5%.  And it is definitely investing for the Satoshi Dice company because the risk premium is ~1.5%.
Yes, by this definition, if you play Blackjack by the book in a casino that uses a standard deck, you are investing because your risk premium is ~1.5%

Usually the prices are within $10 of each other.  And while it's easy to move bitcoin from 1 exchange to another, it isn't easy to move $.  Therefore, this doesn't happen too often.

1) That sucks.  I thought it was implemented
2) Yes.  I thought that was obvious.  But it's really misleading to say that nlocktime can reverse transactions.  It can only reverse unconfirmed transactions.
3) Clearly, you wouldn't accept an escrow transaction with an nlocktime shorter than however long you think it'll take to complete the transaction and resolve all conflicts.  However, it doesn't hurt the receiver in any way to accept a transaction with a long enough nlocktime.

But actually, they did anticipate political parties.  There were political parties in England at the time of the Revolution.  I recall reading that George Washington wrote about the evils of political parties and hoped that they would never happen in America.
Sadly, none of the framers were Mathematicians, or they might have known that a majority-takes-all system of voting naturally leads to 2 dominant parties.  Similarly, if Satoshi had thought enough about the prospects of solo mining, he might have realized that it would quickly become unfeasible for a person mining alone.

Do you know what the economic calculation problem is?
In the 1980s, shortly before the collapse of the USSR, some soviet mathematicians worked on calculating how well the soviets could actually do central planning.  They tried to calculate how long it would take for the soviet government to use all its mathematicians and calculating machines to completely centrally plan the distribution of 1 single product to all citizens for 1 year.
It was upwards of 10^10 years.  Even with the advent of fast computers, that number hasn't changed much.  And that's only for 1 single product for 1 year.

Last, if we have that AngleB &gt; AngleB', we can rename our triangles as A=a', B=b', C=c', A' = a, B' = b, C' = c.  Now we have that Angleb &lt; Angleb'.  The original theorem that we proved tells us that Length-ac &lt; Length-a'c'.
Translating this, we have if AngleB &gt; AngleB', then LengthAC &gt; LengthA'C'.

Here's something that might ease your worries.  The bitcoin protocol includes (among other things) joint owned accounts that require signatures from 2 people in order to spend the bitcoin they contain.

Not without destroying it?  How does that work?
I'm figuring that there is a sticker on the coin that reveals the private address when you peel it, but afterwards, the coin says "spent" or something.
I suppose that would make it a bit more secure, but I still know that the issuer of the coin has access to spend the coin.  And while printers that make stickers like that are not easy to come by, in the future, people might be able to just replace the sticker.
Or do you need to physically break the coin open to get the private address or something?

Or you could do something much easier but slightly more meaningful to most people: just collect statistics on the amount of time before first confirmation and the transaction fee included. This doesn't require anything more complicated than checking blockchain.info.
Sure, the info is cruder, and it's harder to see how the 2 are related, but this is really the info that most people want.  Who knows, the data might be so wildly random that you actually cannot find an average for the amount of confirmation time on a given transaction fee, but knowing the distribution would still be helpful.

2020 Bitcoin is a major competitor to fiat currency.  Most online retailers and some brick and mortar stores accept both fiat and bitcoin.  Most governments have not tried regulating bitcoin beyond taxing it, but they have made their own online currencies.  Because the price of bitcoin is outpacing fiat inflation, many people actually prefer to deal in bitcoin over fiat.
However, we need to deal with the increasing amount of theft by viruses and hackers.  Government police won't deal with it unless you deal in their currency, so hacker groups on the Internet take it upon themselves to track down the bitcoin thieves.
Meanwhile, the courts won't deal with many bitcoin theft or scamming cases.  A law is passed that says that you don't get the same services unless you deal in fiat.  Bitcoin users create their own online court systems to deal with scammers and to enforce contracts.
The bitcoin courts and cyberpolice are more efficient and enjoy better popular opinion than the government courts and police.  By 2025, the bitcoin courts and cyberpolice have gained enough respect that people use them to resolve real world disputes as well.
As the government police and court systems gain competition, they lose their ability to boss the people around at the profit of politicians and corporations.
By 2030, power truly comes to the people.

Please support 2-of-2 addresses!  It is the only way customers can be sure that your company will not steal their funds.  It still allows you to charge fees.
The way it works is this -- a 2-of-2 address is jointly owned by 2 people, and both people need to sign a spend transaction before it is valid.  This prevents either person from spending the funds without the other person's authorization.
In particular, if your debit card company used 2-of-2 addresses, I could be certain that you'd be unable to steal my bitcoin.

But judging by all the fights you've started in this thread, you're not here to learn.  Do you really want me to spend hours tearing through all the math books I've read to find a single story for you?  Will you actually appreciate that?

Bitcoin has a method of doing crowdfunding (also called assurance contracts) built in.  You can read about it here : 
I'm assuming that you currently have the system set up to have the pledgers send money to an intermediate address, which sends the money back if not enough money is collected.
However, this is a bit undesirable because a pledger has to actually trust the person running the website to send money back in the event of the goal not being met, and the person campaigning for money has to trust the person running the website to not charge a huge fee or outright steal the money.
I would love you forever if you'd develop a way for people to do crowdfunding using the standard  protocol.
Here is how to do it with the standard protocol.  It requires the pledgers to run a command through bitcoind that creates the pledge and then send the pledge to the campaigner.  Once the campaigner has collected enough pledges to meet his goal, he verifies that all of the pledgers haven't backed out of the deal by spending their money elsewhere, and then he broadcasts all of the pledges together.  Together, all of the pledges make a single, valid transaction that moves the pledgers' bitcoin to the campaigner's address.
Here is a description from the official wiki, though it leaves out the crucial step of verifying that the pledgers haven't backed out:
* An entrepreneur creates a new address and announces that the good will be created if at least 1000 BTC is raised. Anyone can contribute.
* Each party wishing to pledge creates a new transaction spending some of their coins to the announced address, but they do not broadcast it. The transaction is similar to a regular transaction except for three differences: Firstly, there cannot be any change. If you don’t have any outputs of the right size, you must create one first by spending to one of your own addresses. Secondly, the input script signature is signed with SIGHASH_ALL | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. Finally, the output value is set to 1000 BTC. Note that this is not a valid transaction because the output value is larger than the input value.
* The transaction is uploaded to the entrepreneur's server, which saves it to disk and updates its count of how many coins have been pledged.
* Once the server has enough coins, it merges the separate transactions together into a new transaction. The new transaction has a single output that simply spends to the announced address - it is the same as the outputs on each contributed transaction. The inputs to the transaction are collected from the contributed pledges.
* The finished transaction is broadcast, sending the pledged coins to the announced address.

Unfortunately, most people buying bitcoin have probably never read a supply and demand curve before.
This was my first time trading, and I bet it was a lot of other people's too.  But I think I'm happy with where I am now.

The Exterior Angle Theorem tells us that a total of all 3 angles of a triangle equals the total angle of a straight line.  Therefore, we know that AngleDCC' = AngleCBC' + AngleBC'C, which tells us that AngleDCC' &gt; AngleBC'C.
Also, by the isosceles triangle that we found a few posts above, we know that AngleBC'C = AngleBCC'.

Do you know **why** people want to make Bitcoin debit cards?
It is to solve a big problem in the architecture of bitcoin.  There is no way to prevent the double spending of bitcoins for transactions that occur in faster than 10-30 minutes.  This means that as bitcoin currently stands, a retailer (who must deal with customers quickly and cannot have them waiting more than a few seconds) cannot accept bitcoin without the risk of never getting it.
Debit cards solve this problem by having your money in a clearing house that is trusted by both you and the merchants.
Yes -- there is a demand.  In fact, everyone who intends to use bitcoin to buy anything in a store will need to use a bitcoin debit card.  People just don't know they need it yet.

No, I haven't made a valid argument since my first post.  In fact, I haven't tried to make an argument at all since then.  I've just tried to figure out what the hell you're talking about.

I missed a 3rd case.  BC and AC' could intersect at the point C.  In this case, our problem of showing that AC &lt; AC' is trivial because AC is a subsegment of AC'.  This is the "C = D" case that is referred to directly under figure 4.27.

According to the thread you linked, it's not trivial for the average user to double spend.  You need some huge amount of ppcoins to do it.
However, it's very worrying that the creator of ppcoin doesn't know how many coins are needed for this and doesn't appear to have tried this attack himself.

In 2010 and 2011 I was on a big political kick.  I read a bunch of books on politics and economics and ended up reading a lot of libertarian literature.  First because I wanted to know what my opponents thought, then because I was convinced by them.
From there, I ended up on Bitcoin was being heralded as THE technology that will lead to a revolution that could break the state's monopolies.
I bought it within a few months because Im really into computers and I realized that it was a cool technology.

That's right, I have no model to say that the price will fall.  The best I have is a model to explain why bubbles happen in the event of an influx of new buyers, not a model for how a bust happens after a bubble.
However, I have an instinct that busts happen because of  a reevaluation of the supply and demand after most people have saturated their standing orders.  I'm working to turn this into a model, but it requires some mathematical techniques I won't learn in school unless I take a class on Quantum Field Theory (which I may do within the next few years).  I might get lucky and figure it out ahead of time though.
The reason why I think the price will fall - you're right - is  not based on a model.  It's based on a gut feeling that a lot of sellers think this price is way too high.
But I do know that the model that predicts stable prices is currently being violated.  This suggests to me that the price will not stay stable, since there is no known reason for it to do so.  Furthermore, the reason for the price to go up dramatically in my model of bubbles is no longer holding, so I think the bubble period is over.
