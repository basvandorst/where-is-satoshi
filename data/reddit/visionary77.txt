Voting for a repuklican or dipocrat because he says he's "for" something is like believing in the tooth fairy or Zeus.

Exactly, that's far more important when it comes to implementing a "bitcoin reality".  Oppressive governance structures like the 2 party system and bitcoin at the same time don't jive with one another.  
One must eat the other.....

Absolutely.  Gold is a highly manipulable government-controlled unsound commodity.  Bitcoin is not.  It is sound money unmanipulated by governments and uncontrolled.
Max should say bitcoin is a far SUPERIOR  sound money to REPLACE the easily confiscatable gold.

You can sell btc person-to-person you don't need an exchange.  Buying things with bitcoin is just like cash if you spend quickly which is what most LN users will do.  Spending with onchain btc is a tax nightmare because many people hold btc for long periods and spend it when it has appreciated significantly.  LN users will rarely do this as LN isn't for this.

You are mixing apples with oranges.  You are confusing buying a house with bitcoin and buying a house with bitcoin lightning network.  
Buying a house with bitcoin IS NOT PRIVATE like you propose and authorities will be hip to this.  Buying a house with lightning is fast and semi private on the chain and complete privacy can be had with a vpn.
So yes if you are stupid enough to buy a house with on-chain btc then you deserve to be harrassed by authorities.  But if you take a single moment to do it right, your privacy in value and transacting is all but guaranteed.

How do you think we got this far?  Peer-to-Peer is the backbone of the system. You have too much of a western focus.  Globally, (and that is where bitcoin is being USED) peer-to-peer is the exchange of choice.  
"Buying with cash is not a tax event".....and buying with bitcoin SHOULD be??  You sound like a crypto opponent not supporter.  The Winkles made the same circuitous argument, that a non-needing-to-be-regulated by some government crypto somehow needs a government?!?
As adoption occurs, many will take a stand and say bitcoin is money so I SHOULDN'T pay taxes when I spend my hard earned money.   You are looking at the issue from a controlled-mindset standpoint.  When you think of a digital revolution, you should approach these issues from a position of financial power and independence, not weakness and suppliance.

Wow, you thought you were a loser because of money....sounds like the people you grew up around were the real losers..
They should have never fooled you into believing that money somehow equals winning......they are the losers...don't fall for their trap.

Alot of people bought altcoins like idiots.  They did it this time around too.  You can't blame Max for investors that don't do the slightest research.  
All ANYONE had to do to research a coin is ask a bitcoiner who has been around for some years if altcoins are a good idea.
They would then laugh at you, stop laughing, walk away,....come back 3 hours later...knock on your door....greet your wife and ask if you are home....then when you come to the door....start laughing again......

Which was a great idea AND still is!  The fact that their was malfeasance at MT Gox has nothing to do with bitcoin being a good investment.
Oh, and  I know ,  "what about the people who lost their money on exchange"  .....simply put...they are dumb.  
Not your keys, not your bitcoin.

Money doesn't make winners......  only losers think that.....(not an attack on you)

Someone lied to you.......the biggest growth in the amount and size of bitcoin exchanges happened in 2017.  We all know how that turned out. Exchanges are for people who want to blow money on speculative crap.  Transactional bitcoin and creating easy paths in and out, not gatekeepers like corporate exchanges will spur adoption.

If you said yes to any of the questions you believe you should be oppressed.  Having your information public is a way to oppress, no matter how you look at it.  The others are obvious.

They rely on tx fees.  LN removes much of that.  Next up is atomic swaps and smart contracts on LN.  Why would you need an exchange if you an do it yourself?

You mean the same way the USA uses grandiose terminology like: freedom, eagles, flags, and the strength of the US military to "infomercially advertise" itself?
 "........all this hyperbole i see coming out of dollar advocates makes me very suspicious."
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:44:27
Do you want everyone to know you have bitcoin or use lightning?  Do you want to give any agency a reason to track you?  Do you enjoy unfair taxes?  And are you comfortable with oppression?
If you answered YES to any of these questions then doxxing yourself is right for you!

On bisq YOU judge by reputation and successfully completed trades as to who you trade with. All trades are secured by a btc security deposit to weed out bad actors.  Liquidity can sometimes be an issue but I have found plenty of sellers and buyers when I needed some btc.

Robustness: LN solves this and make tx speed inconsequential.
Censorship resistance:  Solved by using Wasabi Wallet (coinjoin), Samourai Wallet (tor encrypted btc payments), and LN (tor routing of payments and value obfuscation).
IMO, all of these issues are solved.
@_date: 2019-01-31 03:01:40
There's a company called Chainalysis tht works for the government and examines the btc chain and connects tx's to individuals.  You don't think they would love to know what you are using LN for???
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:05:24
The sheer amount of mining equipment that would be necessary to do so on bitcoin would be noticeable by industry experts immediately.  It would be quite obvious.
@_date: 2019-01-21 06:17:21
Only as a routing node and even then capped at 0.5%.

True.  Many of the groups I mentioned do exactly that.  We just don't notice usually. I can't tell you how many times a christian throws god in my face like its an attack on my atheism.  I simply am kind but realize this is acting just like a tech vegan.  Or successful people, first chance they get "throw it in your face".....the list goes on and on....
