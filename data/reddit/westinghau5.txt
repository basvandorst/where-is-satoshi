I was hoping the same but I'm starting to have doubts... Shoulda seen more give in the price already.

I don't have any extra money and I don't have anything to buy. I was thinking about this earlier. I'll always have enough wealth to get by and live pretty well so I guess I'm just playing the crypto game just for fun... If I happened to make a lot of money with it I probably wouldn't live life any differently than I already do as a regular single middle class dude in his 20s. Video games rock. Simple dudes rock.

More FUD. Horse shit. Go log onto Binance and you can disprove your own comment within 2 seconds.

It's so easy to belittle Asians in Asia as a westerner and I believe far too many westerners are belittling the cunning of the East, even North Korea.

This 1000x. Fuck market manipulators. HODL.

And it's also in China's best interest to keep a vast majority of stakeholders in cryptocurrency IN CHINA.

By the way check this out:

Yeah people made billions off of because of your dysfunctional government that you people let run rampant creating profit bubbles JUST LIKE WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH CRYPTO and treating your citizens like shit. Learn to democracy.
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:09:14
You should reconsider your position if you really missed the entire point of the post.
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:23:07
The only reason they'd "ban" exchanges would be to get the government officials in on the action more during the dip.

Most Chinese with the wealth to invest in Bitcoin do have some grasp of English closely within reach and having dated some wealthy Chinese girls I got the feel that it's quite common to talk business among family in China.

Chinese are opportunistic. They see Russia embracing the tech, they aren't going to stifle their own growth. It's common sense. Just watch the market and use your brain.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:14:07
Nice contradiction to your post from 2.5 weeks ago: 


@_date: 2017-10-13 23:22:11
Holy sh... I just had a thought. What if this never ending consumption of things is just a paradigm of consumerism that is shaped by the properties of our currency.
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:44:05
Right, because we all know that's how crypto works. Are you working for them or something? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:58:44
Nukes and hat tricks.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:16:25
Surely you realize there is no possible way they could enforce those regulations on the Chinese population, right? Are you aware of how the whole deal went down in India last year?
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:26:08
This translates more to: "our officials are angry because they didn't buy in at a low enough price and now we're acting like we can actually do something about cryptocurrency so they can buy the fud dip we create."
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:24:35
Just use another wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:56:41
No, of course not. There will be news from China, but it won't matter.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:53:57
That's some sneaky shit.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:03:36
We're all gonna have to serve somebody. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:53:37
That's an extremely low output in comparison to most people in fiat. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:31:44
You mean the megacities with nobody living in them? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:29:34
Nice FUD
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:05:36
And the moral of this story is don't keep your BTC on exchanges. This has nothing to do with a massive price drop people are implying through FUD.
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:06:41
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:09:53
I thought with the hardfork, my BTC holdings also turn into BT2... But maybe I'm mistaken. Sorry, I'm just kind of figuring out crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:45:45
And how did you figure that? It looks like the regulations will hit Jamie Dimon and his manipulation tactics more than anything.
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:17:12
I can assure you, China is not interested in stunting the wealth influx coming from cryptocurrencies right now. They are probably more interested in creating a buy opportunity for wealthy investors tied to the Chinese government.

Thanks man. I got burned a lot before but now I only hodl.
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:09:16
But it kind of curbs mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:53:44
Please exit the community. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:00:51
Honestly this is exactly what I'm thinking. They're trying to manhandle the neck of a bull with their bare hands. Next comes lobbies and attempted regulation.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:11:46
Because his point was not worth addressing for hodlers, and those are the only people I have any interest in discussing with.
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:45:12
Definitely a lie.
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:51:16
The only reason they don't is because those assets aren't easily traded.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:20:16


This would assume the motivation to use would come out of necessity. Paying using the dollar will always be preferable due to it's inflationary property, so until the dollar crashes into the floor, the true necessity of having a deflationary asset is shown. This would assume that bitcoin will be an investment vehicle for a long time, and that when people do begin to use bitcoin as a currency, it'll be absolutely massive on the world stage.
