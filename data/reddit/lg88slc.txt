Being rude makes it hard for others to receive the message you are trying to present. 
And if I made a mistake, I’m sorry. I didn’t the don’t ask about price rule listed anywhere. But maybe don’t take the time to be rude if you find it a waste of time anyway.... that would be idiotic.

If that was a rule I over looked, I apologize.  But I am just trying to learn about something that is interesting and unfamiliar. You being condescending and rude is uncalled for and delivering your message in such a way makes it much less appealing to listen to. An eloquent explanation as to why it is seen as an unwise investment (void of name calling) would be a wiser, more mature, and stronger answer. But if that attitude is leaving you with a sense of accomplishment, worth, validation, and a happy life, then you do what you need to.

Thank you. This is what I’m thinking. I’m not one of those people who wants to be a millionaire next month. I just want to supplement my income a pinch and slowly throw some profits into a savings account for a trip or something. Nothing big. 
But many people offer these black or white outcomes.... “you’ll be able to quit working in a year”! “You’ll go flat broke for sure!”  Hahaha. Calm down guys.

Oh geez! Hahah

Thank you. I appreciate the insight. I’ll be watching closely.

What makes you take this position? I’m genuinely looking for information and education here. :)

Cool stalker skills, but I mean I don’t have any bills in my name, or a bank account, and I’m paid under the table. So getting proof of address is tricky. That’s all. Not trying to be some undercover spy.

“Off the record” may be a better term. Hahaha. I don’t really exist on paper.

Do you trade stocks at all? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:54:37
Ahhhh I did! And I wussed out. Totally should have thrown another $150 in at that point. You were right! I’m pretty impressed with how well you called that. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:54:46
Thank you!

That’s good to hear. I started studying them and how to trade last May. I finally put a grand in to an account in January. Actually having money in there is a little intense, but I like it... a lot. I’m just doing $50-150 here and there until I gain a better understanding.  I am hopeful I can make some money. I don’t want to be rich, I just want to have some freedom and stability :)
Any advice?

Ahh, I really appreciate this. Finding some guidance is a goal right now. 
Im (obviously) new. I’ve been reading up and studying for about 7 months. I’m fairly intelligent and have learned a lot, but I want to make sure I go in to this with sense, logic, and reason as allies. I’m tired of people behaving in such a polar manner. They either say it’s nothing gambling and I am a fool, or that I can make a billion dollars in 6 moths. Finding people who realize you can make money, but you have to stay in formed, not get greedy, and pay attention is refreshing. I know if I try hard, read up, and work at this for a while, I can really impact my life. I make ~$1000/month right now. Saving up $2000 to invest was hard! I have every intention of working as hard as I can to make that money grow. I know I’ll have losses and rough days, but I can handle that. Learning how to really understand these charts and making some myself will give me a great tool. 
So thank you!

This is great! Thank you so much. Do you post your charts somewhere, like a website or YouTube? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:52:54
Thank you so much!! I will remember that.
