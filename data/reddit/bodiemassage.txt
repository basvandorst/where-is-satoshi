Buy coins in person anonymously, donate to politician of choice, in person, off the books, then said politician distributes those coins as he sees fit, again, of the books.  Seems pretty easy to me.

Anywhere you use a CC is already rolling in  fees into price because they have to pay.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:07:12
Well you pay $3 at the atm to withdraw $100 for drinks,  on top of the 3-4% the prices are all hiked already to make up for CC transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:25:59
 You pay cash everywhere,  and vendors don't take CC or debit cards?
