The only reason you get cash back is as an incentive to continue spending money via credit; it's not connected to fees collected by payment processors.
You are the method by which the banks are creating money and they're willing to "pay" for it by applying valueless credits towards your account.  In exchange they are earning the entire balance in your account plus any interest from your future labor.  None of that money existed until you decided to go into debt.
This is what Bitcoin is ultimately about.  We're not worried about saving 1% here or 2% there.

The US dollar has the same problem.

Legal Americans as well.  All it takes is one black mark from a bank offering checking accounts and you can't open one anywhere.

If you feel like you'll be needing other checking accounts you better open them now.  If they close your account and put it in your chexsystems report you won't be able to open another one anywhere for 7-10 years.

Can you exchange USD credit card debt online for EUR or RMB?  You're not buying a TV you're exchanging currency.
If you do a charge back on your TV amazon.com and the banks can take legal actions against you up to garnishing your wages via a court order or seizing the property.
If you do a charge back on XBT they're probably never going to see that money again.

Never keep all your money in one bank.  You can't rely on them to always give you immediate access to funds (obviously).  Open up a few accounts at different places (credit unions, etc.) and deposit a few hundred dollars in each as a backup.
