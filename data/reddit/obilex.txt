yea I made it with Black Mage in mind, but now that you mention it, He also kinda looks like Orko from He-man!

Honestly, I've found that walgreens or other local stores with photo printing services give me the best deal. You can do it online somewhere I suppose, but the shipping normally makes it not worth it imo.

I'm an artist based out of Colorado.  I do graphic design, digital painting, and traditional fine art. With over 15+ years experience in the art industry, I am capable of many different styles and mediums. No matter what the job, be it album art, book covers, game assets, promo art, matte paintings, or just your standard oil on board commissions, I can handle it. I also accept Bitcoin.
Contact me via my website  with any questions concerning artwork.

Like I said in the title, I paint a bunch digitally, and normally sell via a third party printer, but they only accept paypal and credit. Originally I was pretty stingy about watermarks and preventing people from printing my stuff but I just said screw it, Here are a bunch of high res wallpapers that I have painted or matte painted! Feel free to print them out if you'd like, I figure if somebody wants my art badly enough, who am I to get in their way. Bitcoin is something I would like to see more of in the art industry, it really makes being a worldwide artist a feasible thing for folks!
My Website is 
and my instagram is  for more art!
Edit: I've been informed that imgur sucks, so here's a download link to a rar file!

that subreddit name seems a bit redundant, no?
