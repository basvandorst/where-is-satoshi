CME will have contracts out to six months, although there will probably be no volume there. 
But your point still stands because futures are marked to market every day. So if the market is moving against you in the short term, you will be required to deposit more and more capital to maintain your position.  You can run out of money even if your prediction for the final settlement is correct.

The point of the tweet in question is that going forward, most users will use unadvertised payment channels and there will be no way to measure the amount of BTC that is locked up. 
If I understand correctly, this means that your regular Joe lightning user on his cell phone will have one or two unadvertised channels with other routing nodes. Routing nodes will typically be highly available, well capitalized, and highly connected. Their channels will be publically advertised so lightning senders can route the payments over them. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:52:22
Is there a standard for how that communication takes place? Do I need to be able to accept connections to receive payments?  Assume my node is online and I have ten channels open and I am connected to all of those peers. If a random person wants to send a payment to me, do they need something (like my IP and port) besides an address / public key?

So I am not an expert here, but I don't think the situation is that a miner can just decide to steal the funds. It is that a supermajority of hash power has to publically collude for months to steal the funds, and that assumes no revolt from the userbase (USAF, for example)

I was trying to say that even if a state wanted to compete with Bitcoin by actually offering a competitive digital currency alterative, they still would not be able to solve the problem of distribution like Bitcoin has. 
Miners exist to order the transactions and make sure double spends don't happen. This function is easily implemented in a centralized system. But mining also distributes the coins to people who are willing to bootstrap the currency. A centralized coin cannot replicate that.

No those specific examples have nothing to do with my point, which underpins all economic activity. 
If you are dying of thirst and you find a liter of water, that water will be immensely valuable to you. If you find 10,000 liters of water then each liter will be worth much less. 
If you are starving, you might take a job that pays $1/hour for your manual labor, but if you are rich you might pay someone $50/hour to be your personal assistant and save you time. 
The value of goods and services is subjective.  Different people will value the same thing differently based on their needs, wants, and available resources. When these people come together to trade, they each walk away with something that they value more than what they brought to the table. This is how wealth is created.  It is not zero sum.

You are not accounting for the subjectivity of value and diminishing marginal utility. An apple farmer has more apples than he could ever possibly eat. Without trade, he should place a very low value on each additional apple past a certain point.  Likewise a fisherman cannot eat all of his fish, so the each additional fish is worth less and less to him. 
But if they voluntarily trade apples for fish, then by definition there is a positive sum transaction, otherwise the trade would not take place. 
Take away the barter, and it is still positive sum. If the fisherman can sell a fish for ten dollars, that means the fish is worth ten dollars to the customer.  Maybe it was only worth one dollar to the fisherman. After the trade, the world is nine dollars richer.

Yes, futures are designed to be used kind of like insurance, but it sounds like you are a little confused on the details.
If I want to buy a futures contract for 1000 barrels of oil to be delivered in January 2018, that will cost about $58 per barrel.  The price can go up or down between now and then, but sometime between January 1 and January 31, somebody needs to deliver that oil.  So the contract is worth whatever 1000 barrels of oil is worth at the time.  Unless oil is becomes worthless, the contract is not worthless (Fun fact: actually if Elon Musk invented a pocket size cold fusion reactor and 3D printed one for everyone on earth for free and oil actually did become worthless, the futures prices would go negative and the contract STILL would not be worthless).
If I buy an OPTION to buy 1000 barrels of oil for $60 / barrel in January, but then the price of oil goes to $50 / barrel, that option will be worthless .  Nobody would exercise that option because it would cost MORE money than just buying the oil.
I admit that bitcoin futures will probably be used mostly by speculators, just like traditional bitcoin exchanges are mostly used for speculation.   But the one obvious business case for hedging with futures is mining.  Let's say you do the math and determine that you can profitably invest $1,000,000 into your new or existing mining operation, as long as the price stays above $10,000.  If the price goes below $10,000 you will lose your investment and go bankrupt.   By selling futures you can lock in today's relatively high prices and confidently expand your mining business.  Of course you will miss out if the price triples, but that is the price for hedging.  The upside is that you can focus on doing your job, which is mining, and don't have to worry that your business is completely unsustainable with $7000 bitcoins.
I've heard (and it seems obvious that it would be true) that the big miners are already hedging, but they have to do it with over the counter forward contracts.  Having standardized exchange traded contracts will surely improve that situation.
Other business cases can be imagined, but they are probably more in the realm of thought experiments at this point.

The book does a great job explaining this. Basically, people have a major incentive to produce more of anything that is used as money. Things that make good money must therefore be hard to produce.  If the money was easy to produce, the value will be destroyed. Salt was used as money up until the time that salt became easy to produce. In the physical realm, gold has conquered everything else because it is very hard to produce significant quantities of it compared to existing above-ground stock.  Bitcoin is actually the first example of a liquid asset (Picasso paintings don't work well as money)  with absolute scarcity.  The supply of anything else can be increased if there is demand for it. 
Highly recommend the book.

The new bitcoin that arrives will not be touched and will remain in your wallet.
It is inaccurate to think of an address as "having bitcoin in it".  When you create a transaction, either online or offline, you need to reference previous individual transaction outputs as the inputs to your new transaction.  A transaction output is referenced by the  hash of the transaction plus an integer offset for the output contained in that transaction.
If you send more bitcoin to an existing address, that will be a different transaction with a different hash.

The other answers so far are not quite right. The fees are whatever the sender decides. So you could choose to make the fees the exact same or you could choose to pay a higher fee for the larger transaction. It is up to the miners collectively to prioritize the transactions. 
Wallets these days usually let you choose the fee in terms on satoshis per byte, but that is just a UI feature and not something intrinsic to bitcoin.

Semantics. First you have to define investment. For me an investment is when you spend resources on something with a positive expected value. This differs from gambling or blind speculation which has a zero or negative expected value. 
When I started buying BTC, I recognized that I was in a relatively unique position to evaluate its potential.  I correctly figured that the market was significantly underpricing the new asset. So even though it was a risky investment, the expected value was very high.

Bitcoin is the world's most scarce commodity. Perhaps the only truly scarce commodity. Surely that has to be worth something. Just up to the markets to decide what that value is.

No, not quite. 
If there is a twelve month listing cycle of monthly contracts, that means that today (in June), you would be able to trade 12 separate contracts that expire starting at the end of this June until the end of next May. Each contract has a separate price, and it continues trading (and the price continues changing) until it expires.   And when one contract expires, a new one 12 months out will become available.

The words you are using are accurate, but they don't represent what is happening with a blockchain. 
The bitcoin software running on my computer will accept a block as valid if the weight is less than 4. If a majority of miners decide to limit the blocks being produced to 2, my node will not care. The new blocks are still valid under the rules of my software. That's what is called a soft fork in bitcoin.

If someone wants to go long X Bitcoin, they will need to be matched with others who want to go short X Bitcoin at a mutually agreeable price.  (Your example of 200,000 is pretty far fetched that it would probably be impossible. First because of position limits and also limited liquidity )
Each party to the trade, both the buyer and the sellers, have to deposit a performance bond (USD most likely) to be able to make the trade. The value of this deposit will be some relatively small fraction of the value of the contract. At least once per day , the value of these accounts will be "marked to market" so the shorts will lose money and the long's account will increase. 
As the price goes up 300%, the shorts will need to keep depositing more and more money or they will be forcibly liquidated at whatever price the market will provide. The CME Clearinghouse provides the final backstop to ensure that no market participant loses money due to a counterparty default.  
The result of this careful risk management is that  by the time the contract expires , the performance bonds will be sufficient to settle all open positions in cash.

I've heard people call the creation of bitcoin an immaculate conception, and I think that is a great way to think about the enormous difficulty any upstart cryptocurrency will face in trying to overtake Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin had the perfect combination of initial conditions that just can't be replicated. An anonymous founder who completely disappeared, years of mining for very little value, a fair launch without any premine. Nobody was in it for a realistic expectation of profit. New coins can't help but be anything but a money grab.

As many it others have pointed out, futures have become popular for price speculation. Bitcoin futures have some advantages over spot Bitcoin trading for speculators: regulatory issues, access to margin, nearly complete elimination of counterparty and exchange risk (huge for Bitcoin since forever) , an institutional grade trading platform, works exactly the same as the other futures you trade.  Also you can sell Bitcoin futures even it you don't have any bitcoins. Currently this is only possible by going through much less trusted third parties. 
Besides speculation, there are some fundamental reasons why futures could make sense. Imagine  your business was going to have a Bitcoin expense in the future.  Maybe a supplier or contractor who charges a fixed amount of Bitcoin. You buy the future contract now to lock in rate. Now it doesn't matter if the price goes up or down. Any gains or loses cancel out. 
Same thing if you expect future receipt of Bitcoin. Maybe you are a miner or you sell stuff for Bitcoin. Sell the futures contract and lock in the rate.

You don't need a blockchain to do secure electronic voting. It could work, but it is overkill.
In my opinion, elections aren't even a good use case for a decentralized system.  Elections are useful for the existing powers to justify their existence. Somebody is either going to allow you to vote, or not. Somebody is going to decide which candidates or policies are on the ballot. When the election is over, it is up to the existing state actors to peacefully hand over control or implement the initiatives.   There is nothing about such a system that would be magically fixed if the voting were done in a decentralized way.

Your spending money is in lightning and your savings is in cold storage.  You access your lightning wallet 20 times a day, all off chain. You access cold storage once a month to either add to your savings or withdraw.  Your single, once a month on-chain transaction can do all of the following at the same time:
1) add to cold storage
2) withdraw from cold storage
3) close lightning channels
4) open lightning channel
5) modify the capacity of existing channels
6) cooperate with a number of other users to create a single large transaction, which could add privacy and save on fees
This is all in a single transaction. And since it is infrequent and automated, the timing of the transaction is not too important. This lets you save on fees and more easily find partners for the coinjoin.

I'm just explaining my view that bitcoin cannot be changed and that's a good thing. 
Why don't we raise the block size? We can't. We can try, but we will fail. Best case is an altcoin with a little bit of residual value, but Bitcoin will carry on unchanged. 
Rather than despair at our powerlessness, we should rejoice. If we could succeed in changing bitcoin for something like the block size, we could change it for anything.

We know how to transact Bitcoin on a global scale. Just use centralized databases. Visa and PayPal could add bitcoin tomorrow and join coinbase etc in a federation of payment processors.   Of course that isn't the decentralized future we signed up for, but it would be strictly better than the current situation where the monetary unit is centralized. 
Building a massively scalable, decentralized payment system is an awesome goal, but it is useless without an underlying decentralized monetary unit.

At this stage, I believe that bitcoin can never change its fundamental rules. Any hard fork will result in an altcoin, and common sense says that the unchanged chain has the legitimate claim to be the "real" Bitcoin. 
No matter what good arguments you have for why we should increase the blocksize, you need to acknowledge that:
1) there is no "we".  
2) bitcoin can't change
3) points 1 and 2 are what distinguish bitcoin from any of the other altcoins that do have people in charge who *can* change things however they want

Port forwarding isn't required. You should be able to run in through your VPN if you want. 
Forwarding port 8333 is so that other nodes can connect to you, but this is not required for you to connect to other nodes.  Letting other nodes connect to you is nice for them because *somebody* has to be accepting incoming transactions. But don't let that stop you.

If you know your transaction inputs (which are included in the blocks), you can create and sign transactions completely offline.  This is the key idea behind air-gapped and hardware wallets.   Getting that transaction into the bitcoin network is just a matter of transferring a few hundred bytes.

- send it via SMS to a person or service who will broadcast it
- put it on paper or a postcard and mail it

It's part of the very core bitcoin design( and has been since the beginning), so it's just the way that bitcoin works. 
If you mean "why was it designed to work that way", I think it has to do with the desire to have a fixed number of bitcoins and to gradually reduce the rate of increase in the supply. Periodically dividing by 2 is the simplest way to implement that.

If the price stays the same, the least profitable miners will find themselves unprofitable and will shut down operations. This will cause there difficulty to drop and lower the break even point for profitability. This will entice miners to mine again so long as they are efficient enough.  
This has been the design of bitcoin since day 1. Before the first halving, nobody really knew if the mechanism would work. Now that we've had two successful halvings we have a pretty good idea that it works well. With each successive, successful halving, we have more evidence that the fundamental design of bitcoin is sound. This should encourage more confidence in the long term viability of bitcoin. 
Furthermore, the market is currently absorbing 1800 new Bitcoin daily while maintaining the current price. That will drop to 900 new Bitcoin daily. Where will the supply come from to satisfy that demand?  The supply of new coins is fixed. Either the demand must fall or the price must rise.

No not really. Lightning uses the Bitcoin blockchain to ensure everyone is using the same rules. Lightning nodes open channels with each other, which are just on-chain transactions. Once the channel is established, an infinite number of updates can be made to the balances of these nodes so long as they are cooperating. If someone stops cooperating, both parties can still access the coins onchain. 
All of the above is pretty much regular old Bitcoin magic. The trick with the lightning network is that payment can be routed through several channels. To do this the sender of a lightning payment must calculate a route through the known established lightning channels. These channels can come and go and the available capacities will constantly change. Nodes will broadcast channel topography changes so that everyone has a best effort idea of what the network looks like and a decent route can be calculated. This chatter is the lightning gossip and that is what they are trying to optimize.

You are not required (as far as I know)to post Bitcoin as margin to trade Bakkt Bitcoin, but if you are short at settlement you will need to deliver bitcoin. 
Miners, merchants, market makers, and dealers all have real Bitcoin on their books that they might want to hedge.

You can't make sense of the Bitcoin price in isolation. That's why market cap is talked about so much. For sure, it is a highly flawed metric because it is easy to manipulate by low volume and premined altcoins.  But it is important for getting a sense of how cheap or expensive a coin is. 
$10,000 per BTC equals $210 billion and $100,000 per BTC means $2.1 trillion. $2.1 trillion is not unbelievably high when compared to the value of gold, real estate, public equity, etc.

No, if someone wants to go long and there is no matching offer order on the book then the bid will sit there waiting to be matched.  The "house" (CME) will never take the position and the market makers are under no obligation to meet that bid.   
The person who wants to go long will have to raise his bid until it is attractive enough for someone to take.

One of the most impressive things about Bitcoin is that it is the first and only instance of a commodity (for lack of a better term) where there is no demand response. 
Normally, when the demand for something goes up, people will respond by making more of it.
That can't happen with bitcoin.

You don't open channels with merchants. You just need to connected to the network and your wallet will handle that for you.

 1 BTC as a single UTXO is worth more than 1 BTC scattered across 10,000 outputs.
1 clean BTC from a reputable exchange is worth more than 1 BTC straight from the binance hack.

You are describing physical settlement. Cross settlement isn't a thing that exists.

I don't know about ima_computer's uplink response, but to send a transaction all you need to do is send a very small amount of data. This could be done over dialup, SMS, a postcard, carrier pigeon, etc.  Not bandwidth intensive like receiving blocks.

Obviously nobody knows, but having said that...
If you want a ballpark idea you should look at the total "market cap", for lack of a better term. 
$10,000 -&gt; $210,000,000,000
$100,000 -&gt; $2,100,000,000,000
$1,000,000 -&gt; $21,000,000,000,000
So a $200,000 bitcoin would imply a $4.2 trillion market. Compare that to the biggest traded companies at around $800 billion, to gold at around $8 trillion, and to the total value of USD bills and demand deposits at around $4 trillion.  I think $200,00 is a reasonable opinion for a best case scenario without stretching credulity. 
But an additional thing to think about is that many of our conventional assets are priced at a premium because we need to park wealth there to defend against confiscation through inflation. 
Real estate, stocks and bonds are often purchased because they at least provide a return compared to holding cash, which is guaranteed to lose purchasing power over time. If sentiment changes so that people would rather store that excess in Bitcoin instead, then that is how you would see Bitcoin above average few trillion.

@_date: 2018-12-11 20:56:45
The vision for lightning is that your wallet will automatically maintain channels with other nodes to ensure you have good connectivity to the network. Then you can pay anyone on the network and there is no need worry about having channels open with the people you want to pay.

The book explains Bitcoin and monetary history in terms of the hardness of money.
Hard money is more difficult to produce than easy money. History is full of examples of societies having the value of their money being destroyed when a harder money gets introduced.  Gold emerged as the standard because it is very difficult and expensive for anyone to make more of it in any quantity that is significant compared to the amount already in circulation. 
Bitcoin, with a mathematically limited supply, is harder than any money that has ever existed.
( It's not clear to me how the current for fiat system fits in, but having fiat currencies completely unbacked by silver or gold is very new)

It only makes sense to diversify into an asset if that asset is worth investing in at all. You can't buy a bunch of pieces of junk, say you are diversified and call it a good portfolio. 
Furthermore, diversification needs uncorrelated assets. Shitcoins are highly correlated with bitcoin.

CME is cash settled (settled in USD based on an index price from various exchanges). Bakkt is "physically" settled, so real Bitcoin is changing hands.

As others have pointed out, gold and especially oil supplies are very responsive to price signals. Land is the closest thing but has *major* limitations compared to Bitcoin.  
Land ownership is basically at the mercy of the state. It cannot be easily transferred or subdivided. It is not fungible at all.

One time payments don't need to go back to the blockchain and they don't require a dedicated channel to the merchant. 
The merchant issues you a lightning invoice, which is just a small piece of data. It includes their public key and the hash of a secret value.  The channel topography is public so your wallet can calculate a route through pre-existing open channels belonging to you, the merchant, and a number of intermediate nodes. Once the route is established, the merchant's wallet will reveal the secret value. This secret will allows everyone's channel states to be updated atomically.
