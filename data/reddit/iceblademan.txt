* He is from a country well-known for trolls and shitposting.
* He holds 1.1 million bitcoins but calls it his "Tulip Trust."
* He is a vehement climate change denier.
* Every PGP-key interaction he has provided to the press has produced Gibson-esque, full cringe-inducing quotes i.e:
 * “The nature of this moniker is selected for a purpose. I now have resources. This makes me a we now. I am still within that early phase of learning just what my capabilities happen to be. So, even now with resources I remain vulnerable,” it read. “You seem to know a few things. More than you should.” 
The conclusion I have reached is this is either a god-tier long con troll or he is Satoshi and we are the universe experiencing itself and for the first time we are running into some macro cosmic humor.

I was fairly certain it was created by /g/ users, do you have a source for that?
Not that I don't believe you, it'd just be good for the records.

Despite being a critic of how toxic and circlejerky the community is becoming, this is undeniably true. The biggest indicator that this technology is hugely important is the number of bright minds that have invested their time and life savings to initiate bitcoin startups.

None taken. I'm not some bitcoin maven, more of a general supporter of de-centralization and the crypto-community in general. 
I guess what the real argument comes down to is what you define as "origins."
I would define origin as the original intent of the creators. 
Satoshi created bitcoin with the intent for it to be a de-centralized platform of global trade. What it ended up being used for was, as you mentioned, CP and the Silk Road and various other deep web-type things. 
Dogecoin was created by /g/entoomen with the intent for it to be a joke, a gaffe and an organic response to the flood of various altcoin start-ups happening almost overnight. You can see that reflected in the very client itself. 
I feel like being able to separate origins out from the dross is somewhat important. Every coin has pros and cons. 
I don't think its constructive or healthy for the community to not be able to scrutinize their own coins of choice.

I understand what you're saying (congrats on 80k by the way) but I can't help but feel like its coming across as an appeal to plurality. 
Logically, it wouldn't be probable to conclude 80,000 people are blindly falling upon Dogecoin when they're looking into altcoins, no. 
I think there are many factors involved but that one seems to be the biggest factor among many, considering the relative youth of the coin and the tendency of the majority of its users to be new to crypto.

@_date: 2014-05-11 21:48:17


Of course not. You'll notice I have not made one claim about the superiority of one coin over another here. 


That's an open-ended question that would be hard to answer directly. 
I think a large amount of the appeal probably comes from its ridiculousness. A person new to crypto can invest in hundreds of variants promising the same thing, or they can invest in a coin with a funny talking dog that grants ridiculous payouts and has an active community of supporters.

The same reason hundreds of altcoins still exist. 
Blind faith and rationalization such as: *this is the one* and *we're going to be the next big coin, just wait.*

Honestly when people defend their various religions online, they usually end up saying something along the lines of "you simply don't understand [insert doctrine], and if you did, then we'd be in agreement" or "you're just scared about the thought that [insert religious group] is actually right and we are going to [insert divine location]."
Replace doctrine with bitcoin, religious group with the fringe of the bitcoin community, and divine location with the Moon and you have a very common argument seen here multiple times per day. 
"you simply don't understand bitcoin, and if you did, then we'd be in agreement" or "you're just scared about the thought that is actually right and we are going to the Moon."

Western media saying things like "rejected bitcoin before." Clearly propaganda! Everyone knows Russia Bank very excited for crypto-currencies. Other news stories just a test of Russian media system. Western media saying things like "bitcoin is bad!" but eastern sources that are 100000% accurate like RT saying "bitcoin is future!" 
Bitcoin strong as Putin and very good! Please don't believe western media DOG Google search, remember Russia is "based!"

It was literally created by a compendium of users (majority from 4chan's /g/ technology board) to lampoon the rapidly growing number of identical altcoins. 
You yourself admit it was born during a time of ridiculous altcoin expansion, no? 


That was the *effect* of the meme, not the rationale behind its choice. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:27:52
Do you really think someone would do that? Just lie on the internet?
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:39:32


That's awesome, no one is trying to take away from that. 


Never said that. I merely pointed out that its ironic that its origin was one big inside joke and that people blindly support it without realizing this and attempt to shield it from all scrutiny. Annnd here you are, proof of my claims. 
If you honestly knew it started out as a joke meant to lampoon the altcoin explosion of 2013/early 2014 and still support it and the community it comes along with, cool. More power to you and I wish your altcoin success, I really do. I think its a great entry point for people into crypto. 
But I think more people need to understand the origins.
@_date: 2014-05-11 19:06:32
I love how Dogecoin started on /g/ as a joke to make fun of various altcoins. 
They made it cancerous as possible, with ridiculous payouts and even the client having parts of the meme built into it. 
And STILL, people ate it up and will come here defending it saying it "has the power of a meme behind it."
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:01:36
As I said, I don't really look at it as one coin over another. 
The Doge community being able to bring about such organic support and really have real-world results is great for everyone. 
The only real thing I worry about is probably the argument I've heard before, Dogecoin was created with the intent to be ridiculous and it has the potential to scare off "whales" or other big investors. 
But then again people who are well-versed in crypto to the point of investing big money would probably understand that Dogecoin is a sort of strange exception to many areas of the market.

What is this trendline and why must we break it?

That's not how it worked back then, whatsoever. Email was a huge advancement, and offered people a service that was a vast improvement over snail mail, memos, pagers, etc that was previously completely unavailable to the public. The internet had no precedent, and also offered things to the public that were previously completely unavailable. 
Bitcoin does not do that. Its an advancement for a small niche that value decentralization over speed and ease-of-use. There are services that already exist in the same sphere as Bitcoin that do the exact same thing, in a much more user-friendly fashion. 
I'm just really, really tired of people comparing Bitcoin adoption to the internet/email OR saying "people made fun of the internet back then, just like Bitcoin!" They are NOT the same thing (and in the second case no, they did not criticize the internet anywhere close to the size and scale of Bitcoin) and it really just shows me this sub has many users who were probably too young to remember that time.

The ironic thing here is that Mt. Gox was originally supposed to be a trading card platform, when Karples bought the domain.
