[IP Chicken]( is a nice quick way to find your IP too.  Works well if you're helping out your mom or someone too.

Exactly. It's an economic singularity.

It's a quest. Not really about the money at this point

I think it's money, not man-power.  In threads like these we should start saying how much we were trying to claim. In perusing this thread, it doesn't seem like the level of authenticity is what drives who gets paid.
I'm seriously wondering if the dollar amount is the biggest factor.

Yes, absolutely. Do *you* buy stock low and sell high?

A little ff topic, but there's probably no need to crossfire them at this point, is that right?  For mining they probably do just as well as discrete units, right?

I flipped and got a one.

Man that's *exactly* what I'm talking about.

Yeah I know a guy who spent about $400 on a rig.  He'll make it back eventually, but it's not coming back as fast as he hoped.  He's just glad at this point it was $400 and not a few grand.  The difficulty trends will continue I've gotta think.

I feel strongly that Mt Gox wallets were compromised and they straight up lost a good chunk of their coins.  This theory accounts for the fact that no one at Mt Gox can ever say anything definitive that turns out to be true.  That happens when you are lying.
This doesn't affect me, but I sure hope I'm wrong so that you all can get your value back out.

Ignore freebullets.  He's being obtuse and you're absolutely right.

Watching the Mt Gox guys getting interviewed after all of this has confused me.  Because of all the misinformation/lack of information/stammering in interviews/opaque nature of the "investigation" you are either an entirely incompetent organization or you are all lying.  None of you seem to know anything other than "an investigation is pending".  Either you're bad at your jobs or you are lying.
Seems to me a Mt Gox wallet was compromised and sold off.  Simple enough.  Now Mt Gox has the problem of having to pay people out, and those that yell loudest about the new authentication standards are the ones that get first priority to be paid out.  It's a plausible theory that you are using this as a way to manage the flow of claims--to slow it to a trickle.
I hope this theory starts picking up more traction and you all are compelled to address it as the masses start asking more.  So far it's been addressed with "no, that didn't happen".  It needs to be addressed with transparency instead.  I don't trust you from a PR perspective any more than I'd trust you from a data security perspective.

Oh thanks, I just searched and found it.  Perhaps it's time to renew my faith in reddit's search capabilities.
