It would be fair to mention that George Soros made his money from deep understanding of currency.

Does it matter though? They might as well use that knowing shit in their advantage, and not to teach or preach to people.

That's why I think he is dead and frozen somewhere.

So I assume it sorta marks different products, so admin can know which product was payment for? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:25:09
Haha, why the French though? Is this reference to something I missed?

I am complete noob with processing, might I ask why BTC payment need standalone server? Can't it just be transferred to wallet address?
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:49:08
Uh? I found answer to what I've asked in your FAQ:


So, if you have multiple product shop, you will know which one was sold VS having to manually create invoices for each product each time it is sold if you don't have processing server.

I am not sure I am following, you mean "after" as in - how much time has passed after bitcoin reached ATH before other coin followed? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:42:43
Exact date is right below the ATH price number
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:56:51
Hm, it's first time I am hearing this kind of data is useful, why would that be interesting?
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:54:53
Well I have marketcap data, but it kinda intentional because I feel like marketcap can be deceiving, and wanted to present different kind of view

Could you please explain in more details how it can not require internet connection? It will still need to be connected to computer once in a while right?
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:34:45
What? since when customs are accepting bitcoin invoices? I assumed all the buyers here are just doing "personal" orders and then sell 
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:43:35
Better hide taxes

If ebay is not going to adopt it, then someone else will start new ebay with bitcoins. They know it.
