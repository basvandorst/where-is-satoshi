Every day there are daily "tasks" all the members do.  If you do 1 task a day .. you get 100% interest on your money per month.  If you do nothing you only get 20%.  Some tasks are minor like doing a retweet.  Some are pretty spammy and I'm sure its a real problem when you have 100-300k going to the same spot at the same time.

If we could have only stopped them a few hundred thousand years ago we could have avoided disasters like the great lakes, the grand canyon and many other natural atrocities.

Congrats to the creator of the phrase "HODL" for making it into the bitcoin code.

Its all because of MMM mostly and MMM is growing.  I just requested to get paid from them and 3 separate people are sending me funds.  So I'm just one person and thats 3 transactions.  I calculate at least 200-300k or more people in MMM at the moment and growing.  Need bigger blocks soon.

With 100x more black people

I understand.  Just trying to spread the knowledge about it and its effects on blocksize in general.  If I took off the link to the site would it be ok?
@_date: 2015-12-05 20:35:03
If so please no price predictions.

I'd say Satoshi is American if he didn't spell color the english way, said "bloody" once or twice and quoted an English newspaper in the genesis block.

MMM Global is still around.  It is creating a large demand for Bitcoin.  Speculators hopped on last time around and made the bubble though.  
MMM Global is like a virus and is growing day by day.  They hold nobody's funds, the goal is to collapse the world financial system, they warn all members of the risks before investing. 
There are hundreds of video's uploaded a day with Asians showing you how much they have made.  And they are All using Bitcoin. 
I found the vision to be in the spirit of Bitcoin so I joined to show my support (and to make some extra bitcoin maybe).  Better than cozying up to wall street and making friends with regulators.
