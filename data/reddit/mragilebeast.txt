Wire transfers?
Edit - we should still make Bitcoin happen though. Maybe it's to gauge for a reaction?

Hello from California! any sound?
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:05:51
I think there is already a bitcoin node being worked on to be launched in a satellite. not sure of the source though.
from dec 6.
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:54:43
They will be. It's actually how they'll be making some money

Listen to podcasts like let's talk bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:04:10
It was settled for the past few months... A few days of volatility is nothing. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:37:33
I see your point. But do you not feel that theses challenges are necessary to strive for innovation?

Pretty sure most people that use bitcoin to pay also refill their bitcoins by buying more bitcoins immedietly
@_date: 2014-07-05 00:39:52
I used to check it everyday but its gone down to about once every other day haha

he just wanted his lunch ticket haha
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:58:47
Yeah I agree it is still in the beginning stages and these kinks have to be worked out. Hopefully they figure out how to close the spread because I think they would be able to get more customers that way. More transactions. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 07:20:04
I think this is going to be massive media attention. Maybe even kickstart the bubble i may say?? (sorry for the bubble talk) Really though this is all very fascinating.
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:39:33
i can see the creator doing big things in the future. These are really clever
@_date: 2014-05-03 00:17:09
Works well enough

Can confirm for bitcoin CEO
@_date: 2014-09-21 01:03:21
I'll give it a shot 
@_date: 2014-07-05 02:00:12
By then is it not too late?

Satoshi has been silent for a few years now. No one has heard from him since. Until now. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:03:21
I love that word. Troll buster. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 17:49:57
They work around that by users manually pushing transactions via safari.  It's clever!
@_date: 2014-09-20 20:46:00
I get the error "Error importing private key: Address already exists in the wallet"

@_date: 2014-09-22 01:21:52
I'm such an idiot. I was looking at the wrong private keys for the wallet. I got it to work! what a relief!!! But now Im even more assured about how awesome bitcoin is!

You tie a bitcoin address to an individual. And see what the result is by the transaction that is signed by the individual! And verified by the Blockchain! Or something like that...

I've met Andreas and he truly is the real deal. I had no idea he was even really affiliated with neo and bee. So to me, the community lashing out against him is unwarranted. Please take responsibility for your own investment decisions.

1 percent fee from CoinBase to buy bitcoins
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:37:51
I agree when it came to live events such as the hearings the price change was immediate. Everything else was days. Sometimes the price rises for no reason and then we hear the news. That is when I think insider trading comes into play. I feel like the market now reacts less and less to news however.

I'll be in New York from LA specifically looking to spend bitcoins! I will stop by!

The last podcast he had with Aubrey Marcus he said a quote something along the lines like "Its funny how people don't have the opportunity to control currency"
I immediately thought bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:48:47
oh but i did because effectively i sold my bitcoins to coinbase in order to pay with fiat. same difference.
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:47:51
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:33:36
This is actually good news!

that baby hates mt gox too!
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:22:09
im not saying they are both directly related. But it is an interesting correlation
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:42:09
Gyft is cool! 3% back. But they use bitpay. I feel bitpay is sometimes lower than CoinBase. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:56:26
Most companies want contracts here unfortunately....

Excuse me that's what I meant. The fact that its on wall st is still impressive.
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:53:09
I kind of see it as train tracks all stemming from the main bitcoin network.  You can literally do anything on it. You can go as fast or slow as you want. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:57:25
You may not... But millions other do
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:35:04
i think bitpay may be working on something like that
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:15:38
James I love your videos and it is because of you that I was able to understand bitcoin much better! Keep on fighting the good fight
@_date: 2014-08-20 10:48:03
I like the idea of a daily thread.  
It's been an interesting summer for me. I thought it would be different than what it is but I'll take. School starts next week and I'm laying wide awake wondering if I'm going to get the job I wanted. Bitcoin has taken a backseat in my life but I'm still checking the price about once a day. It's interesting that it's almost been a year since November when I got into bitcoin. It feels like it's been forever but Christ has time flown by. Bitcoin is forever though
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:11:48

Yeah it is! Except it's not in use since they're waiting for the issuance of the Bitlicense. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 16:30:06
i took a look at the chart. looks like blockchain reached 1 mill around january. So it took another 3 months to reach half a mill. not too shabby

"I am really sorry for what happened and will do my best to make the outcome of the bankruptcy as best as possible," Mr. Karpelès told The Wall Street Journal after the meeting. He said he had been worried about attending the meeting because of recent death threats he received. "I really hope everyone recovers what they lost and that the culprit is caught," he said.

Can anyone make it into an iPhone wall paper?
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:53:46
Which is what most business are doing. Using either bitpay or coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:35:12
They wouldn't really have to change anything unless they are holding bitcoin. But if the transaction is converted to dollars immediately There is no capital gain...
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:03:47
Oh brother.... they make all the points that have been refuted. They also make a lot of generalizations. Oh wait...whats that... thats the sound of the bitcoin train leaving the platform. CHOOO CHOOO...CHOOOO CHOOOO

I have it but I also have the CoinBase app. Bitwallet is a really good app though. I really like how you can watch addresses and get sent notifications 
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:14:33
This is a great competition for coinbase. Im really digging the interface for Circle!

I went to check it out. First time I tried to register the server went down and lost connection. When it came back on and registered I tried to sell some btc. Now the issue was that the printer wasn't spitting out the receipts so I couldn't do anything. Overall it was a terrible experience and left without doing anything. The spread is terrible. I rather just sell on CoinBase and wait the few days for the money to transfer to my account. Although I will say that it is pretty cool that there was an ATM there and the store is pretty neat. Expensive but neat. Random selection of healthy alternatives. No coca cola or anything like that. The store doesn't accept bitcoin but one of the guys there told me they were looking into it. I had gone in solely to use the ATM and no one that worked there seemed to know how it works, which was kind of annoying. Anyways I still think it's worth a trip down to the store. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:15:10
over 144,000 btc being moved.... and the price falling... HMMM
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:21:06
Definitely able to scan private keys!
@_date: 2014-05-28 20:32:43
I think CoinBase has the potential to do this. It's got a great name and is focused on the UI!
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:34:01
This news brings a smile to my face :)
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:28:52
doubt it. only the public address is being shown 
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:04:14
you might want to check with vault of satoshi
@_date: 2014-05-28 20:31:46
Wow this is hugeeee. Especially with Nas attached to this project. I can see it now, thousands of people creating CoinBase accounts to set up their profiles and then we can truly send bitcoins in a fun social or private way. This looks very good. CoinBase keeps coming out with cool new features. I think the next step is getting CoinBase back on the apple store. Mobile would allow for more frictionless transactions. A local restaurant can have a profile and you just send your bill in bitcoins straight to it. No needing to fuss and fumble. Very excited to share this!
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:54:09
Wow what a great summary of what bitcoin is! Way to go yelp!
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:03:09

Asking the real questions. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:59:59
I rather have a bit coin than gold. That's just my opinion. And that's the opinion of many others. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:20:20
its not
its almost scary how amazing this is
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:35:14
I don't think it's wacky. I get it though. Some people prefer things physically. I like things digitally. I like the fact that it's near instant. I like the fact I can share it no problem. We are in a digital age. It's 2014. The internet and Bitcoin are here to stay! We have to stop being so afraid of things that are new. We have to think outside the box. for the first time in history banks and our financial systems are threatened and are naturally nervous. Bit coin is too small for banks to do anything really for the time being... But when they fight it will be too late. It doesn't matter if you don't think it's a commodity. It will likely serve another purpose for you. I can guarantee it. The technology is beautiful. It's genius. This is the future. I don't care what anyone says. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:59:09
This is fantastic! Took a couple weeks. Tis all good!

@_date: 2013-12-10 17:56:16
Best place if you don't want to tie in a bank account is localbitcoins. I was lucky enough to find a seller who was nice enough to go through the whole process with me. Make sure he is has a solid reputation and I would contact the person in advance if he has a cell phone number in the post. It's always best to speak to the person before so you could set up the exchange. You give him dollars. He/she gives you bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:21:04
No bank account needed.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:47:50

It's more than just a currency. It's also a commodity. It's also a payment system. And it's also a public ledger.
