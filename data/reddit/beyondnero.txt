We warned you. BCH is a centralized coin controlled by a number of people and their leader is Roger Ver.
You people never listen. Complete the sentence, your keys...

No fiat to convert to. They are either out of money or just holding peoples money just because they can.

Explain your disapproval.

I know what it is, but it has become increasingly attacking every idea and fear mongering as of late. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:07:55
You don't need balls for that.

Do you have [Way of Redemption]( on steam?
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:32:46
Don't forget a lot of people sell, so there will always be Bitcoin to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:29:14
Are you strapped?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:55:35
Are big players moving into BCH?
Edit: changed money to moving.

This is exactly what it is. People talk about Bitcoin going to the moon, but forgetting that each and every one of us has a moon to reach.
OP reached his moon.

Seriously this subreddit is slowly becoming a bitcoin cult.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:32:21
Don't buy Steam games with Bitcoin.
