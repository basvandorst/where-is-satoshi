Lol in your butt?
Whatever keeps your tinfoil hat on buckaroo.
The tinfoil hat made it obvious.
Stop "reinforcing" your tinfoil hat.
Glad you know what a price chart is.
Your tinfoil hat is showing again.

Spot trading means settling the trade immediately. As compared to futures when it's settled at a later date. You can leverage spot trades. In laymen's terms, spot trading is buying immediately with cash, instead of a card that takes until x date to settle and transfer the payment. Leverage spot trading is paying for something with borrowed cash.

So this neither "explains" the dump or uses the correct usage of spot trading.

Why is it that you need to consistently have a witch Hunt against people you don't like instead of just accepting the most probable truth? It's almost as if you're scared of Bitcoin cash and that's why you always need it to be the cause of anything bad.

Your comment history is funny. Full of "it won't be going lower than x amount after this run(which it did every time), this is the bottom(which it hasn't been yet), this run isn't over yet( like on the 25th of last month when it was literally ending its run)". The only thing you seem to be good at half of the time  is calling where a run won't stop before reversing. If your longs are real though and you're not just talking to talk, good for you, you've made some money.
