I think I will. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:09:20
The force is strong with this one
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:08:34
Pleased that you got a chuckle out of it.
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:18:39
Haha! Thank you! Made me chuckle
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:50:36
I really wish I knew!
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:23:28
Well sure. The internet isn't just full of trolls is it? Ah I've got so much to learn!!
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:31:21
Ok, this supposed to be about making me feel better...
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:04:59
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:42:37
Yes sir/mam. Just wish I could be reading this thread and not be the dummy.
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:10:43
Ah man! Makes me feel sick that more people will fall for this shit!
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:15:34
Thank you
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:24:53
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:51:20
I actually wish I did. In fact is this a dream? Wake me up!!
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:07:30
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:05:30
Exactly! Smart fellow ;)
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:58:20
So true!
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:50:05
I whole heartedly agree. No due diligence done. Spur of the moment thing. Totally got burned and rightfully so. Still doesn't make it feel any better. But, hey at least it wasn't all my pie, just a nice bite gone.
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:45:55
Love it! Makes me feel a little better for getting scammed today
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:08:51
No. Should I?
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:09:29
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:16:52
Well thanks, HEY! No wait! What?
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:19:21
Very true. In fairness I was distracted and yeah greed.
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:29:10
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:15:58
Correct I sent it like a dummy
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:31:40
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:29:08
Sounds legit
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:22:05
This guy, seriously? Please just go away now
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:26:59
Stupidity? A momentary lapse in concentration whilst dicking around with my wallets? A million reasons. Trust me it's easy to say "I can't believe anyone could be so stupid" but when it happens to you you'll understand that it can easily happen. Just a couple of variables need to change for it to happen to you. Much like driving, you're only ever a couple of variables away from an accident, none of which have to be entirely down to you before disaster strikes.
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:29:19
Or you
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:54:25
Well, I can't count so couldn't tell you, sorry.
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:14:13
I know right?
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:10:59
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:11:09
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:09:32
Thank you
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:17:56
Well jeez, tough love in your household!
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:30:37
I will call you! :)
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:31:54
That's nice. "Look everyone, let's point and laugh at the idiot!"
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:53:03
Everything seems reasonable from the outside
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:13:41
No, it hasn't knocked me that much, but does make you think about the fact there is simply no way right now to fight this or claim it back. Mass adoption just won't happen if we can't fight criminals
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:25:20
Probably because its already over, but that doesn't mean it won't come round again and sting some more of you.
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:27:16
More than a new game's console, less than a high end PC. Not life changing, but I hate being cheated out of anything.
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:07:08
I still trade, and really I'm ok with losing on a trade. This was a whole other thing. Stings a bit worse.
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:16:18
Cause I'm stoopid. Duh
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:20:50
Why? You got a good giveaway address you need me to send BTC to? 
I give you some, you give me more back? It's how giveaways work right? Right? RIGHT???
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:49:12
Someone beat you to the punch, but good one anyways.
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:16:39
When put like that it sounds dumber. But don't you remember ICO's when you had to register your address. I thought it was like that, but for some reason felt it was legit for 1 sec that I had to send funds first. D'oh!
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:41:09
Indeed. Wise words. This is the difficulty of being an unregulated market. There is no way of getting funds back from shady or illegal agents. Even though we can see exactly where the funds have gone.
@_date: 2018-08-31 10:24:54
It was an awful time and sadly I think it's put the revolution back by a couple of years. 
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:13:24
Thank you for sharing. Yeah it feels pretty shitty not gonna lie, but there is some relief in sharing the stupidity. So thanks for that
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:56:01
Freewallet is always great! On the play store. Try it out I'm very happy with it. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:47:57
I just saved the comment and your reply comment as a pdf! 
@_date: 2018-11-12 10:28:14
Compound sell over the next 3 months of say 30% of your coins. That way you don't feel bad by selling at the wrong time. And you still have a nice chunk to watch go up over the years.
@_date: 2019-01-07 12:37:32
Looks like it might use a finger print scanner? 
@_date: 2018-07-01 08:10:31
I never even read any of this in the first place, thus negating the need to save or delete anything. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:25:58
I disagree, I firmly believe the traditional investors will look to diversify a very small percentage of their portfolios maybe 1% to 5% into bitcoin. Simply because of the potential it has to go parabolic during the traditional market down trend. There's very little risk in such small percentages for them, but could be huge sums into crypto. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:16:55
We already have them. They are all over the UK just Google them. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:33:36
Can I just say to OP you don't need to run a node to own bitcoin. It's nice if you want to, but no way is it essential.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:53:11
Very well put, I just didn't want the OP to misunderstand how it works is all.
