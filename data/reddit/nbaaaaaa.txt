"BTC itself fundamentally has not changed significantly in the last month..."
Absolutely true. 
But has BTC itself fundamentally changed the last 12 months? If not why it it worth 8000% more than 12 months ago? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:14:36
I'd rather have a guaranteed $2,000 loss then losing $20,000.
Don't let emotion ruin your investment decisions.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:27:38
I'm just showing that limited supply does not equal high value.
Limited supply alone cannot justify value, especially when the product can be easily duplicated to a resonable degree like Bitcoin can.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:56:40
some people thought Pets.com and Potato.com was also a revolution.
Not all revolutions make money. Sorry
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:32:24
stop buying crypto.
frankly your allocation in cryto is way to high already.
Over 50% of your portfolio is in BTC. That is not a good allocation
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:33:34
Not really.
If it tanks to $999 it will be much easier for it to gain real strength. Most of the speculators will be burnt so bad they won't come back. Then Bitcoin can slowly grow in value as the network and product improves.
Its the same thing that happenned in 2000.  Internet companies like Google have been able to slowly grow in strength and value from 2000-2018.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:05:22
it better hold the $7k level today.
if not it could get slaughtered tonight when Asia sees the blood.  We could see $5999 while we sleep
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:27:43
show me a stock that has increased in value for 100 years. Then I'll show you 99 that have not.  And many of those 99 companies were not crap.  They were just surpassed by superior technology.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:19:09
This dip is different.
Yes bitcoin has dipped many times in the past and has come back much higher.  But that was because NEW BUYERS powered those moves back up. I don't see any new buyers at these price points.
We are in for the big one. I'm talking about a 95% dip to $999.

@_date: 2018-02-05 19:02:37
smart decision IMO.
If BTC is the real deal you will have other opportunties to invest
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:28:45
But size matters.
We are talking about hundreds of BILLIONS in Cryto value going up in smoke.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:59:44
Like I was saying all last week if BTC held $8k it would break $10k.
We are at another resistance/support point again. It needs to hold $10k for a couple days to get to the next level $12k.  If we hold $10k through the weekend I see $12k early next week.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:09:58
yes it broke. But it has to regain $7 and stay above.
If not when Asia wakes up on Tue they will see the blood and we get $5999 tommorow
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:08:44
not even close.
there are still too many faithful left.
This won't bottom out until almost everyone gives up hope. That will be at about $999
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:47:51
come on bro.
Who has the capital? follow the money.
Bitcoin only has $100 billion.  Wall Street and central bank has TRILLIONS.

@_date: 2018-02-06 14:29:55
chance to go bankrupt? Yup, most only get one chance to go bankrupt.
Bitcoin will see $999 because that is what the fat cats in Wall Street want. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:22:23
You obviously did not live through a market crash before.
You can hold an investment and it can go down to $0

There are only 5,000 limited edition Purple Unicorn Teletubbies. Does not mean they are worth $500,000 each.
limited supply means nothing if the product can be easily duplicated or imitated. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:02:40
My point is holding does not always guarantee you won't lose.
Selling and cutting your losses have saved many investors from being totally wrecked.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:54:13
I knew this was a bubble when my 70 year old lawyer was talking of buying some Bytecoin
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:08:23
Nope. I said it would go down when it was $20k, $15k, $10k, $9k, and $8k.
It will reach $999 in the next 12 months.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:26:52
but are you not scared that another ETF or security will have a much lower premium then GBTC?  
I thought of buying GBTC but I can't get over the 40% premium.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:22:58
wasn't one of the main benefits of Bitcoin is that it isn't regulated?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:58:56
Bad news is a given.  Wall Street can easily payoff some scum to report some bullshit fake news. Happens all the time with stocks.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:36:41
doubt it. 
These kind of huge moves only come when whales start cutting their positions.
Small guys selling won't cause these kind of massive and sustained dips.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:10:56
agree with you.
sentiment is bad but still way too much hope out their.  
When many of the long time bulls start giving up, then we are close.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:32:34
No new buyers this time to power the recovery
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:08:23
Looking really strong.
I think we see $10k soon, sometime over the weekend
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:38:05
Do you see any possible situation that Bitcoin drops to $999 in the next year?
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:07:50
just make sure its a Lambo
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:11:59
Could be $9. 
Could be 9 cents.
Its all about probability and risk/reward.
I'm pretty comfortable buying bitcoin at $999
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:45:14
I'm not selling!!!
but I never bought either!!
waiting for $999
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:58:59
you are messing with one of the most volatile assets on planet earth. If you can't take the swings you should really sell and invest in something more stable with less risk/reward.
There is a reason why some of the most experienced and successful investors of all time won't even touch crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:10:17
Not true.
There are things that are not crap that never reach their old price again. 
Something not being crap does not mean it will increase in value forever.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:24:16
IMO, the big boys of Wall Street want Bitcoin to tank hard this year.  The big investment banks are pissed off that they missed the huge run of Bitcoin the last 18 months.  They saw it run 3200% and gained nothing.
So the Wall Street big boys will manipulate Bitcoin to near $999.  Then they will load up and pump the bad boy. Even if they only get it back to $5000 they will make massive gains.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:58:15
I agree 100% with your assessment.
The big boys are pissed off they missed the massive run up and will manipulate the market to have some of the action this time around.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:54:34
IMO, the question is $3k in the next week
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:06:53
Fear - All investors should have fear. Fear of going bankrupt. Fear of ruining their future. Investing with no fear is more dangerous then having fear.
Uncertainty - Can anyone invest with 100% vision of the future? Hell no. Uncertainty is always part of the investment equation. That's why you hedge and manage risk, because no one can be certain of everything.
Doubt - Having doubts about an investment is healthy. Having no doubt is being naive. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:16:19
I'm not holding any bitcoin.
I'm waiting for it to bottom out.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:07:13
so you think price is purely determined by supply and demand?
what what determines demand?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:40:58
This is foolish.
If you BTC goes down and you lose $10k you are still losing $10k. 
Its called opportunity cost.
Just because you can 'afford' to lose something does not mean you should do nothing to avoid the loss.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:07:41
please explain why BTC is worth $20k
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:26:10
Note8 is way too big for my situation.
Stop trying to incite a fanboy war because it won't work.
Like I said, if Samsung makes a better phone/ecosystem than Apple I would switch. But they have not.
And why the hell should I care if Apple 'slows down' a 3 year old phone? I get rid of my phones every 2 years. Besides I rather have a slowed down phone than a phone that battery dies in 2 hours or blows up.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:09:10
so totally reliant on demand?
So when speculators and gamblers no longer buy then can we expect it to go back to $999?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:16:48
went bankrupt in 1999
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:24:55
bitcoin is down 65% in 7 weeks.
you are right. Not a good comparison.
Pets.com didn't lose over $100 billion in market cap in less than 2 months.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:48:33
This is the .com bubble all over again.
For those who invested during the .com bubble we could see this bitcoin dump a mile away.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:05:49
The positive: Bitcoin will teach millions of youths the difference between investments and speculation.
May young people who got crushed during the .com bubble are much better investors today.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:37:07
it is what it is. 
Please don't get so emotional. Bottoms are marked by extremely bad sentiment. We have not hit that yet.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:35:55
Amazon had to prove itself for over 2 decades.
There was no guarantee Amazon would execute the way it did.
For every Amazon that figures it out over 2 decades there are hundreds of Compaq's.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:21:13
So you don't think size matters?
Ever heard of the expression too Big to fail?
If Bitcoin hits $999 people will freak out.  Yet hardly anyone freaked out when Bitcoin lost 90%+ of its value 4 years ago.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:36:20
Were those changes a secret when the price was $1000 last year? I doubt it. People knew about those changes a long time ago.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:40:58
I don't hold myself as cleaver as Wall Street. But I do ride their coattails.  The move for Wall Street to manipulate the price of BTC down is pretty obvious.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:44:07
So if someone offered 100% ownership of Macy's for free you would refuse it?
Macy's isn't crap.  Its worth almost $8 billion.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:57:22
True. Seems like the obvious move to sell any spikes up at this point. The trend is still negative.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:33:38
its true. Wall street will do anything to maximize profit.
they missed on a HUGE opportunity with Bitcoin. They are PISSED OFF.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:03:19
No I didn't.
Even if you can afford to lose the money, you are still losing money.
Its called opportunity cost.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:05:22
Looking strong.
Needs to stay above $8k for the next couple days. If not it could test $5k again 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:54:40
Looking like a dead cat bounce.
Think we see $4999 this weekend.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:52:01
Looking good. Needs to keep the $8k level for a couple more days then it can break $10k or more.  If $8k breaks the next couple days we could test $5k again
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:27
8 years is very short
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:28:49
i don't. but i know how those crooks think.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:15:08
I guess you don't really understand what FUD is.  AT this point it is spread as a meme only without any basic understanding of the concept.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:49:51
I was clear.  If $8k held for 3 days we see $10k.  If not we test $5k again.
Go study your technical charts.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:07:10
why do you choose to buy GBTC?  It has about a 40% premium over buying BTC direct.  Is it for safety and conveience?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:43:18
I don't know your full financial situation but my general recommendations:
1. Emergency fund - have 3-6 months of cash in case of emergency. Tapping into high interest credit card debt can destroy your returns.
2. Pay off all high interest debt
3. Max out 401k match
4. Max out HSA if available
5. Max out Roth IRA
6. Invest in low fee broad based ETF's. About 85-90% of your porfolio
7. Invest about 10-15% in individual stocks, gold, other speculative investments
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:52:40
what perma-bulls sold?
All the high profile Bitcoin perma-bulls are still HOLDING long and strong.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:32:10
no.  But I've been following Bitcoin for over 3 years. 
I see definite value and tremendous value if they can improve the product.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:02:04
It was new money and new buyers that allowed BTC to rise higher after every big drop so far.
I don't think there are new buyers this time around.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:07:35
I think we bottom out near $1000
This is coming from a pure human psychology and technical analysis.  
The run up starting at about $1000. So a full trip will be from $1000 to $20,000 back to $1000.
At that point the gamblers will be out and Bitcoin can steadily grow value with the technology.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:37:49
so you don't see another Bitcoin ETF coming soon that could have a much lower premium?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:38:55
Not crap.  Just they are not worth as much.
Look at Macy's.  It use to be worth $20 billion.  Now its worth only $8 billion. Does it mean its crap?  Nope.  Its still worth $8 billion. But no one says HODL Macy's since it will long term be worth $20 billion again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:50:16
Bitcoin will be $999 in a couple months. Why? Why not is the real question.
12 months ago Bitcoin was $1k.  
Tell me Bitcoin believers has the product gotten 20000% better in the last 12 months? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:04:08
I think the X is worth $1000 for me and probably 100,000,000 other people.
For something I use every day for 2 years for 12 hours a day. 
Paying a couple dimes more a day is totally worth it to get the best phone for my situation.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:40:17
Not good.
This needs to hold $8k or we test $6k again in the next few days.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:55:44
yes ultimately its the amount of $$$ not number of buyers. But usually they are correlated
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:14:46
so you could not get the same education without investing in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:00:44
IMO?  I'd say about $900-$1000.
Once we hit that level most of the speculators and gamblers will be out and Bitcoin value can grow nicely with the technology. The price just got to ahead of itself.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:02:01
no one knows for sure. 
but from experiencing bubbles in the past we are not even close to a bottom.  A bottom happens when basically everyone just gives up.  Still too much hope with the bitcoin faithful.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:51:11
not really.
The whales could still be bullish long term. But they want to lock in gains.  Most are up 20000% or more.  Why risk losing all those gains when you can lock it half of it and sell half your stake.
Some whales may be moving on to a new asset class or a less volitile asset.
All I know is if I had a $20,000,000 bet that paid off, I would cash in that ticket right now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:33:25
If Fiat does not matter, why are people so obsessed with how much each Bitcoin is worth in USD??
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:21:28
whales are trying to maximize their profit so they won't allow it to drop to $6200 right away.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:51:41
history yes.  But Wall Street and the central banks want in on the action. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:56:27
also easier for crypto to go down 50% from here. The knife cuts both ways.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:53:03
in another month we may hit $2999
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:59:29
You can get knowledge without gambling thousands of dollars on a speculative asset.
Sounds to me you are in denial.  In denial that you messed up big time. Its better to face the facts and cut your losses.  Bitcoin can easily drop another 50% from here.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:14:08
I understand investment risk/reward.
And buying Bitcoin at $8k is not advantageous IMO.  The risk clearly outweighs the reward.
Again as a product what changed the last 12 months with Bitcoin? Nothing much. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:12:05
"If you believe we should be higher in the long run, you might as well buy now."
Nope. Its called probability and risk management.
Sure I believe it will hit $100,000 one day.  But am I 100% certain? Hell no.  I'm not even 70% certain.
I don't deal with absolutes.
Investments all come down to probability and risk/reward.
Buying Bitcoin at $7,500 does not fit my risk/reward calculation right now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:09:03
I always research any investment I make.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:39:48
but that is still a net zero for number of buyers.
all the previous other run ups had a net positive of new buyers.
I don't think we see new buyers until this thing bottoms out at $999
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:53:35
losing $15k is no biggy? What?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:18:59
who cares. Even a slowed down iPhone6 is way faster than a Samsung from the same generation.
 If Samsung, HTC, or Shit.Company builds a better phone and ecosystem than Apple for my situation I'll switch.
But no one has. So I buy Apple.
I don't give a damn about Apple. But flatout they make the best phones and OS right now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:34:49
Weak hands quickly turn into smart hands depending on price.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:11:32
No one cared about volitality when it was $8.
For most Bitcoin was just a fun little toy to buy.
But now we are talking serious dollars. People are 'investing' significant portions of their portfolio into BTC.
No one cares when Tom's General Store stock drops 80%. But people freak out when Walmart or Apple stock drops 80%.  Size matters.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:30:32
I'm not. 
I have not spent a single penny on bitcoin.  
But once it hits $999 I will.
Anyone who knows market and asset theory and human psychology can see what has happenned the last 12 months.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:26:46
Ask yourself:
Are the big boys of Wall Street happy they missed out on the 3200% gain the last 18 months?
Wall Street has TRILLIONS in capital to manipulate the market. 
I'm pretty sure their plan is to tank Bitcoin to $999, then load up.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:20:19
Total destruction. 
Under $7k now.
$999 in the next 12 months.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:17:14
in about 10 hours
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:04:10
personally I see $999.
but I never expected Bitcoin to hit $20k so fast either. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:53:29
WTF. End of February?
Why are you in such a rush?
It has just as much chance to drop another 50% then to recover in 3 weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:43:27
Lot of positive sentiment today.
We have not reached a bottom yet.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:35:52
People who have big gains who want to lock in their gains.
Could be couple big whales who bought at $1 and are now cashing out to lock in tens of millions in profit. Can you really blame them?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:53:55
this isn't church. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:37:11
There are tens of billions in alt coins. So no it isn't true that BTC is the only game in town.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:04:05
When I bought is irrelevant. 
When you bought is also irrelevant.
Those are sunk costs.
All that matters right now and in the future is opportunity costs.
Even if you are up 1000x you are still risking the same amount as anyone else.  If Bitcoin drops 50% in 6 months you would lose just as much as someone buying BTC today.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:21:42
does it really have to be all or nothing?
what if you just sell half to cap your losses?
Personally I'd sell all of it.  IMO, we see $999 this year.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:57:03
sometimes people need to learn the hard way.
experience is a very expensive teacher.
I guess its just part of life. Live and get wiser.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:55:38
how do  you know it will recover?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:27:27
if you study technical analysis 999 is a key number for Bitcoin support
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:53:03
So if goes to $0 you don't lose? LOL.
Go tell that to people who invested in Pets.com and Enron.  Yes you can definitely lose and lose more if you don't sell.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:23:41
So those changes are worth 20000%?
Those sound like standard network upgrades. 
So do you pay 20000% more for software when they make standard network upgrades and get rid of bugs? i don't think so.
But what about real world benefits?  Have those upgrades made BTC easier to use as a currency for normal people. Hardly.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:52:32
personally I'd cut my losses.
then wait for it to bottom out and then invest again.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:41:58
Nice come back today.
But it must hold $7500 for a couple days and make its way back to $10k next week.
If not we will test $5999 and the wall might break this time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:46:52
its an open market.
price is determined by supply/demand
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:42:28
They are still up massively.
Many of these whales got bitcoin for $1 or less per coin.
Why would they risk losing hundreds of millions?  
They could be selling 50% of their stake and not totally liquidating.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:45:44
won't look foolish when this hits $999
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:52:02
first mistake: bitcoin isn't an investment
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:44:56
it was $5999 in the last 24 hours.
don't be cocky.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:24:03
Today's Senate hearing tells me we have not bottomed out yet.
Way too positive.
Bottoms are reached when sentiment is so bad that even perma-bulls start selling.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:54:44
Don't worry about it? You should worry about it.
Narratives change all the time. The market is fickle. 
If you are not willing to hold Bitcoin for at least 10 years, you should sell.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:49:35
No way we have bottomed out.
Sentiment was not negative enough.
