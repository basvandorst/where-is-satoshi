Havnt used usdt before. Is it that bad to move your coins there during dumps like this then back to btc or whatever coins when it pumps back up? I know its not backed by usd. Havnt messed with it bc i dont know that much about it and i hear its not ideal. Just wanting to know why
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:14:31
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:22:22
