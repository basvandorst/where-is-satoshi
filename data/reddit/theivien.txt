tell us when he gets his money back ...
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:33:13
There is no controversy though if nobody sees controversial opinions, which is better for btcon golds in the long.
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:02:05
Finally getting rid of them freeloaders ...
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:37:56
but this way they will get lost in obscurity easier and prevent divergent narratives and make this sub a better place for btcon users
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:37:06
Yeah, mods should decide who gets heard in btcon community
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:46:54
my sentiments exactly - and those two options are actually becoming a bit too real for my liking
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:28:37
Yeah, we don't need 3rd grade negativity in btcon coinbase community !
@_date: 2015-12-16 15:48:05
1 coinbase shatoshi bit = 1 coinbase shatoshi bit ... so why have shatoshi bits if you should not send them ?
@_date: 2015-06-07 10:37:33
Your Words^TM
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:35:15
Maybe its better to just let mods choose comment order, that way its easier to stick to the official btcon dollar narrative and not waste time with divergent opinions.
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:57:39
Don't invade his privacy you jackbooted thug !
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:56:57
HA, HAHA, hahaha... "the miner's care about the security of the network" - its funny cos its not true !
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:16:56


Any day now ! I can barely wait to be a shatoshi multi-millionare, and having it mean something !
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:20:35
yeah man, what said - profit is hella dumb ...
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:53:58
Magical ... almost like a Christmas miracle
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:54:55
mtgox btcscoins community is stronger without a single leader and also if satoshi did ever step up he will interfere with official community moderators authority and narrative
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:54:32
Accepts bitcoins and does what with them ? sell them for USD ? debasing the master currency ? not with my BTC he won't.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:40:30


Without qualification this statement is bullshit. People would buy all sorts of shit with bitcoin if it was beneficial to use bitcoin, e.g. cheaper, faster, more secure, etc ... even the few things you can buy with bitcoin (that you can also buy by other means) does not really improve on any of these points.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:06:03
Does he actually hold bitcoins he gets as donations ? Cos if not, donating to him is debasing BTC, and not something I would refer to as "bitcoin-supporting". 
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:06:59


Nah-ah, cos math ! Actually not joking, do it, and find out that bitcoin remittance is like adding a completely useless element to the process, unless of course the whole world only uses BTC, but then the idea of remittance does not really make sense.
@_date: 2015-06-17 22:40:32
But, but, WHAT ABOUT TEH CHILDRENS !?!!!?!?!?!? WHO WILL JUST DO IT TO TEH CHILDRENS ?!
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:30:07
Cos we all know it can only go better from here right ;)
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:00:04
No wonder the bitcoin community is struggling to go mainstream ... don't be an asshole to newcomers ... ffs
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:36:57
How bout if its a "stable" long term down trend ;)
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:12:55


Cos we all know this is going to happen ! Those statists won't know what hit them when they have no more FED left to use as their personal slush fund !
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:29:25


And if we all get wealthier in the process, well, that is just what they call win-win in economics right ?
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:04:09
Yeah, cos your loss is still ok, you still have some time to go before you are as butthurt as the 800+ people are today.
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:03:31
what about about teh childrens ;( teh blockchain mines teh freedoms of the childrens ! without it teh childrens will be in teh shackles.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:30:12


and then subsequently crash hard again ... bitcoin doesn't need bull runs - its just idiots who bought overvalued assets hoping for returns that need bull runs.
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:09:16
And so far, we are doing so well in reaching this goal !
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:37:45
Thanks, please send coins though, this will be infinitely more helpful than a reply.
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:53:19


captors = overvalued asset ...
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:17:17


Maybe if you are really nice to him he will let you touch his Google ... seeing that you are so hot for Google.
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:36:17
Yeah, like wtf, incentive should be to promote btcon and grow btcon community - fucking karma whores.
@_date: 2015-06-20 23:48:38
More bag holders for everybody !
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:16:42
yeah, this way more people would spend bitcoins, which will drive down price, which means cheap coins u guise !
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:48:20
Yep, straight down from here !
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:40:27


So you are monetizing your loss now instead of holding for the inevitable ^moon?
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:32:30
The mailing list includes a link to  - which shows double spends. Are all the red and orange ones successful double spends ? And why is some orange and some red ?
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:32:52
Why not ? And how is it not debasing BTC ?
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:40:15
Funny how people hold on to overvalued assets long past the point where it still makes sense and then try and convince others that their overvalued assets are good and that everybody should also buy the overvalued assets ;) Almost like Stockholm syndrome no ?
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:24:38
You have money to buy bitcoin and you are not buying bitcoin !? how !? do you no believe that it will take over all other currencies ? This is highly irrational behaviour ...
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:30:47






In an oppertunity to get more bag holders online or hold more bags ...
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:01:11
Faggot !
Make it 10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10 !
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:18:56
So then you must have sold all your fiat already? Otherwise you're just spouting nonsense, proving you don't believe what you're saying.
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:11:21


But everybody know it will trend upwards (to the ^moon) in the long run !
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:39:32


There is hope, you can speak to people who can help you with this, financial advisor, psychiatrists, even religious organizations offer up some good advice.
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:50:24
So you don't trust that they are doing this then ?
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:53:12
OMFG, someone thinks that assets he has vested interest in will increase in value. This is some intriguing shit, I would never have guessed it is even possible ... could it be that you discovered a biased person in real world !?
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:17:38
I'm also accepting bitcoin ... wan't to make a thread for me ? I will donate the USD value of each bitcoin received to democrats.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:21:40
So you are telling me that I cannot buy anything useful with BTC ? o_O
@_date: 2015-06-17 00:17:25
I would also like to remind everybody that I'm still accepting donations for Hillary Clinton. I will donate USD amount to her campaign or PACs for every BTC donated. As a special deal to anybody reading this, if you include the code RANDPAULISAFAGGOTASSREPUBLICANDOUCHEBAGUNLIKEHILLDOG in donation transaction as a public note I will donate 2x the USD amount.
Hillary Clinton is not a faggot ass republican douche bag, which is why you should donate everything you can and vote for her.
META: How are you still not banned from here ?
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:52:45


Why not ? They fuck up your transactions, they loose your money, they don't work ?
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:10:20
having $1 billion USD will make me a billionaire ... ah the joys of day dreaming.
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:44:04
Don't worry, it will get there !
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:22:43
Where did you get the 0.05BTC ?
@_date: 2015-05-20 08:11:17
Hoping to make money and not wanting to lose money is not the same ...
EDIT: Fixed spelling, @_date: 2015-05-20 17:59:50
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:17:31
Fucking-A - I'm selling BTC at 10x market price if anybody is interested, its a bargain cos "price of bitcoin will rise".
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:26:31


Excatly this ! - most retarded strategy ever.
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:18:09
What $8 USD ? 0.2 BTC is closer to 80 USD than 8 - which, yes, makes this an insanely bad deal ... but lets just not fib on how insanely bad.
@_date: 2015-08-11 20:13:39
[ITS HAPPENING !](
@_date: 2015-08-11 20:17:31
[ITS HAPPENING !](
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:18:00
That would be a dick thing for her to do ...
@_date: 2015-07-19 19:05:28
Why don't you just hodl...
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:26:56
Ok, but, its only a circle jerk if we congratulate people for what they say they will do, instead of congratulating them based on what they have done ...
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:21:53
I guess this is not relevant as bit-Coin has no fees ...
@_date: 2015-09-06 11:37:04
oh noe !
@_date: 2015-11-28 23:05:35
DHCP != DNS ... rtard
@_date: 2015-11-29 20:03:03
Good god man, you are some special kind of stupid.
