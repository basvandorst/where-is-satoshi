Thanks for the tips guys! Unfortunately i fucked things up and sent them to a dead address and the money has disappeared into the void. Oh well lesson learned, haha

Isn't that insecure? Why would i store my BTC's on a website somebody else owns..

Thanks for the info. I setup a wallet on MultiBit temporarily while The QT client does its thing. Im not sure its working though, I did a few free BitCoin sites and have since received nothing&gt; I created a new wallet from the one the initial installation gave me. Do I need to refresh something when i do that?

Regardless of your feeling on 4chan, its has been at the center of internet culture for almost 10 years.

By their own definition every currency is a pyramid scheme because it profits somebody when more people use it.

Anonymous Ops (pre occupy) was fueled in part by BitCoin. After AnonOps  became its own movement, they integrated BTCs into their support network, with limited success.

"..if BitCoin does well they get rich.. Cleverly disguised spam"
What? These people need to do a bit of research before spouting this shit

i created a new wallet on MultiBit, idk if the code changed or not. How long does it usually take to receive a transaction? For instance i requested funds from the bot about 15 mins ago and still haven't gotten anything
