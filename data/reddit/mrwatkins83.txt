It might not be as much a personal insult or a disagreement with him. I imagine Mt Gox fatigue has hit many of us and we just don't care anymore.

I hate to break it to you, but almost every publication does this or something very similar to this these days. Selling ads is hard.

now tagged as "Eats Hats"
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:15:12
I think of it as more of a tag relating to outlandish statements than actually eating hats. 
@_date: 2012-09-07 21:24:51
What about improperly? How could a purchase like this be correctly or incorrectly done?

Litecoin has a (very low) value, but I'm not sure of any exchanges that exist to trade other cryptocurrencies. If I had to guess, I would suspect that Litecoin will see a bump in mining and value once the ASIC units come online. Whether that can sustain itself is anyone's guess.

Sorry dude.
@_date: 2012-09-07 21:24:23
Oh nice, that's a very handy tool. Thanks for sharing.

I read that Coinbase is now linking bank accounts directly to their service. I've never used it before, but that might be a quicker way of getting into the game.
@_date: 2012-11-01 02:44:00
Did they withdraw cash or did you have BTC that were moved to a different address? Is it possible to trace where a cash deposit went?

I wonder what percentage of physical USD in circulation is used in the drug trade. I wouldn't be surprised if 5% of all moneys in this country already goes to drugs.

Yeah, my account took about 10 business days to validate and when I added a Dwolla outpayer, it took three more days to validate that. Be prepared for a wait if you're trying to get your money in or out of Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2012-10-27 16:42:38
At least not without mixing the coins first.

I dated a girl named Sandy once. She was a whore.

Why is this being downvoted? This sub should encourage new participants in the exchange, not downvote them when they have questions about how to become involved.
@_date: 2012-10-26 18:47:12
It's going to take a very long time for the rewards to drop to near-nothing levels. Even then the coins will theoretically have more value, meaning fewer actual rewards would still yield profitable results so people will still mine. That's the theory, anyway.
@_date: 2012-11-01 02:52:23
If this has been 10 years ago, I'd agree with OP, but there are some many sites out there that the technically savvy (Bitcoin demo) already knows about. Maybe webcam shows for BTC, but those aren't restricted by credit card companies anyway.
@_date: 2016-05-20 23:01:39
I received the same invite. My guess is an email list somewhere was compromised.
@_date: 2013-03-18 22:07:49
Should have saved this. We touched 49.70 briefly a little while ago and we're trending up. I would bet that we'll be at 50 very soon.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:39:15
Seals with Clubs does several freerolls a day that award chips, which can be turned into BTC. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:36:17
Yeah, using Dwolla also requires verification.

BFL update from the future:
* Receiving latest chips from manufacturer (Oct. 13, 2893)
* Internal testing and first chips placed (Oct. 26, 2893)
* Mass production begins (Nov. 1, 2893)
* First units ship (Mid-Dec. 2893)

Well, I gave this a go and watched a few videos. One of them wouldn't play because it was blocked by a copyright but the others seemed to play all right.
It's a good idea I suppose, I just wonder how much the site makes per video to justify running this service. After about an hour of video watching and queuing, I made $0.05.

A bitcoin can be divided into many, many smaller parts. Even if there were a few thousand left in circulation, the economy could continue because of how far down the divisions go. Fewer coins would mean the remaining coins and their subsequent divisions are worth more.

Anything Amazon releases would simply be a gift card with a set value that could only be redeemed for Amazon services or products. You're right, "currency" is certainly not the right word to use, even if Amazon is the one using it.
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:59:03
Yeah, I can picture a hefty chunk of users who went through the process but are still skeptical of BTC.
@_date: 2013-02-15 22:32:15

Nice! I've been watching this afternoon. It's feels good to be a part of the milestone.
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:32:31
bitmit.net is like eBay for bitcoins. I have a couple of listings on there now.
@_date: 2013-03-18 22:29:45
Even better than a program 
@_date: 2013-03-27 06:09:38
[bitcoinget]( is a service that gives away small amounts of bitcoin in exchange for video views and user performed tasks. I played around on it for a few minutes. It's legit, but you'll make pennies for hours of your time.
@_date: 2013-01-23 04:08:58
And in two years, the BTC will be worth something while the rig is again replaced by something better.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:28:07
I've only made one transaction on localbitcoins.com but it was a pleasant one. I'd do it again if someone else replied to my listing!
@_date: 2013-06-16 03:37:27
That's the "thank you" everyone is actually waiting on.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:03:09
That's true, but the value of the dollar doesn't fluctuate by 20-something percent on the Forex on a given day. 147 to 110 is ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:30:01
I doubt the ATMs have cash deposit options because the only way to access an account via an ATM, to my knowledge, is to put your debit card in the machine, which links you to your account only. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:29:39
Exactly. The AP sends out wires. And you don't just get AP stories in your inbox, you have to pay for access first.

Sell a good or service for bitcoin. Do you have any items you can part with? Try bitmit.net.

Account created earlier today and it's done nothing but shill for BFL... seems legit.

Is there a Because this post belongs there.
@_date: 2013-02-14 20:36:03
Congrats to everyone that pressed for this to happen. It's been a goal of this sub for a while and to see it actually come through is very rewarding indeed. I count this as another notch on our "legitimacy belt."
Edit: Thanks for the reddit gold you beautiful anonymous user, you! 
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:18:34
So close!
@_date: 2013-10-18 18:55:26
Great... now where am I *not* going to sell my things online?
Loved the concept, but none of my listings ever sold. Ever.

@_date: 2013-03-25 20:38:16
This would be my guess, as well.

BTC was in the teens on Jan. 1. It's been a wild ytd.
@_date: 2013-05-05 04:24:27
Check out an AP manual of style. It's a godsend if you plan to write more long-form articles like this one.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:14:16
That's what I'm doing right now. Buy low sell high.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:20:54
I was making a killing when BTC was in the low 100's. It's been a while since I've sold any though.
