no attacker would be able to just fish for a pass phrase, you can search online for websites to give a estimate on the time it would take for someone to just brute force a password

Bitcoin community's big scarey boogey-man: Debt, regardless if your ancap or libertarian or whatever if you invest in bitcoin/gold/silver thinking it will protect you somehow in a post-apocalyptical end of the world scenario where SOMEHOW the united states has defaulted on its debt then your a moron. What you need to be investing in is guns and bullets not bitcoin.

wow i havent seen a brainlet try to argue something like this before, let me give it a try! im guessing stocks and crypto are uncomparable because of some vague reason of one of them has a large portion of the market share in a category ?? well actually its not too different then if you view BTC in the "crypto" category then it has 30% of the market meanwhile if you look at apple's market share of "cell phones" in america being at about 40% apple is still just as large in its own market, there i can make random pointless arguments too that dont relate to the subject that we were talking about, feel free to make another really vague statement to try to make it look like you have 2 brain cells to rub together

thats fucking stupid whoever said that has an absolutely insanely small brainlet, if you compare BTC to any other investment its volume is unmatched today btc had a volume of 6.5bil with a mc of 192bil, while apple has a mc of nearly 900bil and a volume of 5bil, on top of that one of the main selling points of BTC is how insanely liquid it is as an investment with the option not only to exchange it directly into currency or any other currency since BTC-pair is a universal pairing and also using it as a currency itself
