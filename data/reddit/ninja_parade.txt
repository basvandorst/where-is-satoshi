I'm willing to rely on every implementation's self interest in keeping code compatible by default.
Of course there will be cases where this can't happen (like when an implementation is pushing a hard-fork), but as long as these incompatibilities are disclosed, I believe they help ensure every user gets some control over the outcomes.

In one he points out that on-blockchain zero-conf will not last forever, and we need other solutions to enable instant transactions.
In the other he points out that restricting the block size pushes otherwise viable transactions out of the system.

Not exactly, the implementation of SW, if and when it happens, has a similar effect as a bump to 1.75MB.
Of course they're using that as the carrot to get everyone to accept the patch, but that's still an improvement.
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:10:26
2 alternatives:
1. Do nothing
2. Ship SW and get some capacity increases (best estimate is 1.75x), along with some other benefits (less malleability).
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:05:26
That's a little silly, considering that SW, if it increases transaction throughput, increases block sizes (transactions themselves will not be smaller, and will still need to be transmitted).
If a block size increase to 2 MB is too controversial, then so is SW.

1. They can't forge the blocks (because everyone stores the headers). So the only attack a theoretical cabal of all archive nodes can do is deny service by refusing to serve the blocks. So the risk of having very few nodes is much lower than with mining or with validators.
2. Pruning doesn't have to be all or nothing (you can decide to store 10%, if that's all you can handle). Having 200 nodes each storing a random 5% of the blocks, they all get to decrease their storage cost 20-fold, while having 10 independent copies of each block (statistically speaking). This isn't ready yet, but then again, almost no nodes use `--prune` at all.  
@_date: 2015-12-27 05:12:09
The logic is sound but the assumption that miners spend most of their funds on variable costs isn't valid.
Since a huge chunk of the cost is actually the depreciating hardware, we can expect the following countervailing effects to happen:
1. Miners will not invest in more mining hardware as the reward halving approaches. This will lead to a period of heightened profitability.
2. Only the variable portion of the costs actually drives the hash/don't-hash decision.

Very cool. I need to read this fully, but here's a question in the meantime:
One of the potential scaling issues of Bitcoin is that validating a block must be done by each participant. Does this scheme allow me to put a (block + UTXO after previous block) in and get (INVALID | UTXO after this block) out?
Is the verifiability check only possible by the uploader, or can others also rely on the result's correctness?
@_date: 2015-12-27 14:53:34

Tell me which step isn't working for you.
1. There's less mining hardware purchases.
2. Therefore there's less mining hardware.
3. Therefore there's a growth in per-watt profitability near the halving that doesn't get arbitraged away (because no one can profitably build/buy new hardware and pay back its cost before the halving).
4. Therefore per-watt profitability is higher pre-halving than it otherwise would (because difficulty is lower than it otherwise would).
5. Therefore this lessens the percentage of miners that are underwater post-halving.
6. Therefore, not all hardware is off post-halving.
It's a mitigating factor of course, doesn't guarantee that everything will  go well, but it does make the situation a lot less dire than the assumption that electricity cost/block is the only factor.
@_date: 2015-12-31 18:03:49
The good part is it fixes malleability problems. I think it's useful for that.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:32:43
It's definitely not a real fix. On the other hand it has the advantage of ensuring the TX is present on *both* forks, making it "safer" to accept than an output only on the settlement (or on the Coffee) side.
If you accept a fork as inevitable but want to maximize safety regardless of what ends up happening, it's a possible solution.
I think the added complexity for recognizing coinbase transactions in unnecessary, and needlessly would complicate the logic of the unification software.

What? Disk size is the least important issue, by far. Network is a bigger problem. Fully validating nodes can already run with `--prune` and not have to worry about storage space.

@_date: 2015-12-27 06:00:13
Let me walk you through an example, I don't think I'm getting the idea across:
Getting hardware costs some amount for a given GH/W rating. Using that hardware costs some amount (for electricity). Hardware depreciates (let's depreciate it to zero linearly over three years). Your economic profit is zero when (Cost of hardware) + X years of mining operations = X years of revenue (where 0 &lt;= X &lt;= 3 and is the value maximizing such revenue). 
Then, 3 years before the halving, the reduced revenue from the halving starts affecting your decision to invest in more hardware. If the halving is going to make new hardware impossible to run, you'll be doing profitability math based on a shorter payback period (since mining hardware that can't be run profitably is worthless). As we approach the halving, that pre-halving payback period starts getting ridiculously short, and no one buys hardware unless it'll generate some non-zero net operating income post-halving (not even replacement hardware for broken miners).
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:06:29
I suspect so.
Because they're shipping physical items, it would be simple for them to accept payment up front, then recheck right before it goes out (way more than 6 confirmations in between).

You want every miner to be paid the same. How do you know reliably that two computers do or don't belong to the same person? Otherwise, every big miner just pretends to be 100,000 people.
Well as far as we know that's impossible. BUT, if you actually found a way, then you'd also have a mechanism for getting rid of sybil attacks.
At that point, just let every person vote on the next block, and use the magical technique you figured out to make sure every human gets only one vote (not real human voting, mind you, but every human's node would vote on their behalf). It would waste no energy and be extremely decentralized.

You've seen nothing my friend. You'll know bitcoin has truly arrived if and when its borderless, uncensorable nature isn't even talked about anymore. It will just be normal, and no one will even talk about it, neither to deride or applaud it.
Just like the fact that the internet has pretty much made censorship pretty much impossible in the western world is not a topic of routine discussion anymore. All the people who thought free speech would destroy the world have moved on their next bugaboo, with nary an acknowledgement of how wrong they were.

If this isn't throwaway money (and it definitely doesn't sound like it), I'd look at setting up whatever education savings plan your country has. You can only invest in regular assets (stocks/bonds and the like), but your returns are tax free.
Even with normal stock market returns by the time she's ready for college, this will easily pay for an undergrad in most places, or for the first year of an ivy league tuition.
If you want to invest some of it in Bitcoin, you should limit it to a small proportion (5-10% of the total).

Is the fund unlock part of the script? Or is it in the form of a presigned reimbursment transaction using nLockTime?
The only issue I can see is that these addresses need to be funded first (which takes at least 1 confirmation), but are not double spend safe when the 24hrs is (nearly) over.

The way the Payment protocol works, a merchant provides you with a digitally signed request for payment. You then make that payment, and your wallet keeps a copy of this request.
The combination of blockchain entry and payment request constitute a proof of payment.
The payment request can be stored and use to track what you paid for.
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:40:56
Yes. It's not actually very hard, because it's a small set of trusted actors communicating amongst each other. They could even use Mike Hearn's payment channel technique to reduce the amount of trust needed to near zero.
The big challenge is of course that this requires work, trust, infrastructure. It has to have a payoff, and I just don't think micropayments (sub $0.50) are simply big enough yet to justify this kind of investment. In the long run, it really depends on which direction mining fees go (and I'm firmly in the camp that believes they'll go down over time, making these efforts pointless).

That's incorrect. Merchants would still validate the transaction, they'd just trust the sender not to attempt a double spend against them.
Now, everyone using MtGox as their green address service would have effectively lost their funds. That always was the risk, and there are better designs of the same idea (using multisig), to eliminate counterparty risk. Although it looks like we won't need them anytime soon.

The crypto involved in making a hardware wallet is no more difficult than that used in chip cards. Chip cards benefit from being mass market devices, so the costs are extremely low.
Long term, your hardware wallet is a credit-card size device with an e-ink touchscreen, passively powered thorugh induction by the point of sale or your phone/laptop. You tap it, it receives the payment request, analyses it, confirms the amount/destination with you, asks for a pin (just like chip cards do), and sends the signed request right back to the merchant. That would be prohibitively expensive right now, but we're only a few years out from the userbase being big enough to justify the R&amp;D.
Your backup is just a series of words it shows you the first time you set it up. Write that onto a piece of paper, store it somewhere safe. Or maybe you get two cards right away, so that you always have a working backup wallet somewhere. If they're cheap enough, it just works.
If you lose it, the person stealing it has to figure out your pin before you go home and press the panic button on your other one.

What? No. They see a transaction being broadcast that pays them. They look for the inputs that are part of the transaction, and make sure it it already in the blockchain. I'm certain merchant processors already handle this.
Not doing so exposes you to more than just malleability bugs: it's trivial for me to make a super long chain of unconfirmed transactions to myself (one or more of which has no fee), and finally send the last output to the merchant. Odds are this transaction will never clear, so a merchant would be foolish to accept it.

No, because you can expect to get some funds back as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. So the expected value is something higher than zero.

He's bundling a Tor client into Bitcoinj. He [wrote the bloom filters code]( that allows your phone wallet to be able to use random nodes safely, instead of relying on central servers. He's proposed extensions like getUTXOs which (while possibly flawed) allow people to build apps without relying on centralized services.
And funnily enough, most of the changes he proposed that he actually puts his weight behind and pushes for are the decentralized ones.
The only reason he stands out as some kind of boogeyman is that:
- He doesn't filter his suggestions to only include decentralized stuff. If it doesn't look like something can be done in a decentralized way, he'll suggest a centralized one, rather than just abandonning the idea.
- He'll happily throw half-baked ideas in the discussion. Doubly so if doing that gores someone's ox.
- Some people who disagree with him in general (dislike SPV wallets, don't want to increase block sizes, dislike bloom filters, dislike the payment protocol), pick the controversial/bad stuff and use it to try and discredit him.

Somewhat. Ultimately if PoW is under clear attack, it's possible to hardfork to whatever else we want (Proof-of-Stake or whatever is invented by then). That acts as the ultimate check against a 51% attack.
So far it seems like the dynamic is for miners to be lazy and accumulate in pools until they get close to the threshold, then many will abandon it at once, bringing it to a safer %. It's ugly, but it seems to work ok.
Semi long term solutions include P2Pool (pooling without central control) and GetBlockTemplate (pooling where the miner decides what gets included in the block, rather than the pool making that decision).

Setting aside the sarcasm, such a registration could be made trivial, nothing more than a sworn declaration on an online form (for small amounts, big amounts would need verification). The idea is that you'd fall under *someone's* control, and they'd be responsible for holding you accountable. Worst case, anyone who doesn't register gets assigned to a random country's authority (or is subject to the union of all possible restrictions).


That's exaclty how the current financial system works. It's nearly impossible to transfer funds to certain countries right now, and that's a deliberate design.

Yes but they don't do it in practice.
Partly because lazyness (the default code doesn't even let the double spend into the mempool), partly because pools who try and pull that shit will get into trouble with their miners, and partly because they'd have to set up a parallel relay network to do make that available.
@_date: 2014-02-03 02:34:16
Anyone who still wants to. As long as ~10% of miners decide to stay on the old codebase, the system will plod along at a reasonable pace (and eventually readjust).
The point is that miners can't pull a fast one, they can't change the inflation schedule and try to spend these new coins with unwitting merchants. They can try to strongarm everyone into switching (by all abandonning the old branch), but it would require a &gt;90% coalition to make the threat stick (and if they do try that, users of the currency could just come up with a hard fork of their own to reset the difficulty and change the hashing function, completely destroying the value of the miners' hardware).
A 51% coalition can do many bad things (blacklist, force fees up, eliminate competiors' blocks), but they realistically can't increase inflation.

It keeps the safety concerns in one place: the system with the keys. With a credit card, each transaction increases the possibility of theft, especially with smaller merchants. With bitcoin, if my system is secure (and this is still a challenge for mainstream adoption), it doesn't matter who I deal with and how good or bad their security is. From a systems design and security perspective, that's how it always should have worked.

When bitcoin was worth pennies and could be mined by the bucket load, nobody cared to start an alternative. It was just easier to jump in.
The first fork was Namecoin, which was created to do something completely different.
Then mining started being harder because of GPUs, and some people started scrypt-based alts to keep the CPU-mining party going.
Then people realized being an extreme early adopter on an altcoin was a great way to make money from other people. This started all the pump-and-dump scamcoins.
Eventually someone figured out how to automate creating new coins to sell to the scamcoin starters (who in turn who try to pump-and-dump their way to massive profits).
Now that's dying off too, and most alt creators are trying to figure out how to make their creations survive.

The quantity theory of money has this simple equation:
M * V = P * Q
The monetary mass (M) multiplied by its velocity (V) is equal to the price level of goods (P) multiplied by how much goods are sold in that currency (Q).
Your statement basically says that if V increases faster than Q, then P must increase (and hence the value of bitcoin falls). That's possible, but in practice there's a limit to how fast money can change hands. V can't simply grow exponentially forever.
More importantly, price stabilization (even if it is at a low price) removes the incentive to get rid of the coins as quickly as possible.

Coinbase doesn't contribute as much to the open-source community, and there's a very simple reason for that that has to do with incentives:
- Coinbase runs a web wallet (with off-chain transactions). Because they're competing in the wallet space there's an incentive to keep all the features they build in-house.
- BitPay doesn't have a business outside of bitcoin merchant services, but they have a very large share market share already. The only way they can make more money is by growing the ecosystem, eventually resulting in more merchants adopting BitPay. This is similar to what Google does to increase internet usage (and hence be able to show more ads). So they're tackling some of what they think is most problematic for adoption (Wallet security, ease of payment, etc.)

In the sense that it makes assumptions not originally in the problem. So it's not "really" solving the problem. That may seem pedantic, but in theoretical computer science we are complete pedants. 
Bitcoin also only gives honest actors no advantage over the attackers.

The NSA doesn't telegraph their moves like that if they can avoid it. Doing stuff in the open like this is silly when they could just roll it in silently without telling anyone.
That's what they did with RSA Security, Skype and others. If it's closed source, they don't ever tell you what they did, and you'll only find out with the next Snowden's leaks. Hardware microcode definitely falls under this category.

- When you move coins to an exchange you give them 1 BTC, and in exchange their software remembers it owes you 1 BTC. Now "your" coins are just a number in a database.
- Some dude does the same with dollars, then you proceed to sell your BTC to him for $500 on the exchange.
- The exchange software makes the trade, now their database says it owes you $500, and owes 1BTC to the other guy.
As you can see, this is purely an internal accounting measure. The actual bitcoins are still where you sent them (and the original dollars are still in the same bank account).
Only deposits/withdrawals will show up on the blockchain.

They could do that anytime, yet in the 10 years or so since people have started clamoring for net neutrality, it hasn't happened.
The reason is that their hands are already tied by (admittedly anemic) competition. The few things they've done and not gotten destroyed in the marketplace for (throttling torrents and VoIP) were mostly done because of how crappy their networks are (and can't support the advertised speeds if more than a few people are using the capacity concurrently). They know their 1 or 2 competitors are in the same boat, so none of them will poach their clientele by promising uncapped torrenting speeds. That doesn't apply to low bandwidth applications.
So why argue Net Neutrality in terms of apocalyptic hypotheticals?
The real fix anyway is not to regulate carriers (a step towards very dangerous federal control of internet traffic in the US), but to phase out the monopoly rights granted by municipalities. Competition will force neutrality without involving the state. Hell, I'd support anti-trust breaking up of the cable monopolies long before I'd support regulating their behaviour any further.

Except you need to get the actual merchant to see the transaction paying them in order to trick them. This is hard because you have no way of finding that out.
You'd have to figure out the IP of the merchant's node. If they're using Bitpay/Coinbase/BIPS, you'd have to find all of their nodes (and often time they're directly connected to mining pools precisely to negate your attack).
Also with [this pull request]( everyone on the network will know about the attempted double spend within seconds, making this technique completely useless.

I'm sure sticking up a single QR code on your page, which is what many charities do, wouldn't be allowed by the law. But I'll take your word for it.


There's multiple bits in the [bill you endorse]( that do not fit that description:
- Refundable tax credits (not deductions) on small contributions are arguably a subsidy for small donors.
- My Voice vouchers are flat amounts that can be used by anyone, regardless of whether they paid taxes or not.
They're both especially bad because the amounts don't come out of the donor's pocket at all. There is zero cost to giving those amounts to politicians, except effort. This leads to the same broken incentives that encourage voters to make [terrible choices at the polls]( (zero cost + small likelyhood of actually influencing the election == mostly self-expressive behaviour instead of rational analysis).
The only voluntary piece is the submission of funds into the Freedom From Influence Fund (the 6-1 match). For now.

The short explanation for why true anonymity hasn't been integrated yet is that, while we know of techniques to do it, they would increase the CPU/bandwidth cost of running a node by an order of magnitude or more.

Yes it is. Their verification procedure takes a long time (2 weeks IIRC), but wire transfers happen rather quickly.


Basically it was nearly impossible to get fiat out of MtGox unless you had a bank account in Japan. It wasn't that BTC was worth more, but rather that the USD on the exchange was valued less. Then in the past few weeks, Japan yen withdrawals stopped working, and finally BTC withdrawals were stopped.
No one really knows if the problem is that MtGox is insolvent or just extremely technically inept. In either case, moving any money there means there's a good change you'll never see it again.

The bitcoin tip bot has a $0.20 minimum. Maybe you can argue that that is too low. Maybe you're right. I was recently tipped $0.01 in dogecoin though, which is basically spam.
Negative articles about bitcoin make it to the top page of this subreddit on a regular basis, if their argument is remotely novel. Try the google autocomplete for "Bitcoin is" and for "Dogecoin is" and tell me which one is trying harder to change the results.
I'm not saying our community is blameless. There's definitely an undercurrent of dodgy get rich quick people (which is why there are now pyramid schemes and the like targeted at Bitcoiners). It just seems like Dogecoin is the worst parts of Bitcoin's community, amplified.

With fiat money, what protects you is the presence of withdrawal limits. Someone trying this trick with you and your ATM card can only get a couple thousand dollars at best, unless they're willing to keep you hostage for a while.
You can replicate that in BTC-land:
1. Have most of your funds be sent to a newly generated, one time address.
2. Generate time-locked transactions moving small percentages of your funds back to your real wallet in 24,48,72... hours. Keep copies of those in all your wallets (they're harmless so you don't need to keep them secret).
3. Wipe the private key for those funds.
4. You now have time-locked funds. Not even you can move the money before the delay is up.
Some variants exist: Instead of wiping the key, put it in a safe place (ie. not on your person), use multisignatures, etc.
Another alternative is to keep an empty paper wallet at home. Prepare a transaction that sends all your funds there. Make broadcasting that transaction be triggered by a panic button, or a dead man's switch of sorts.

Basically all blocks have a parent, except for the genesis block. This means the genesis block looks abnormal, and isn't parsed (IIRC).
That doesn't matter since the root block is hardcoded in the program, but it means that block's transactions (ie. just the transaction creating 50BTC) aren't considered to be spendable.

If the verify locks the funds (makes you unable to send them elsewhere) then this is exactly the same as a 2-of-2 multisig transaction.
If the verify doesn't lock the funds, then this is useless against double spends.
Instant transfers are almost bulletproof for small (&lt; 1k) amounts anyway. If we need better solutions, having 2-of-2 multisig addresses where 1 of the signers is the customer, and the other is a double spend prevention service (who signs a spending transaction only once), is entirely viable without new operations.

Nope, selfish mining requires 67% honest hashpower if and only if full nodes randomly pick between candidate blocks if they have the same proof of work. Since they don't, instead, a selfish miner needs to be able to propagate their blocks faster than everyone else. There is no evidence that this is actually feasible, and there is strong evidence that this is not being done. Most large miners have direct connections to each other in order to counter this attack.


[DNS has a single point of control](
Relevant quote: "VeriSign generates and distributes the zone file to the various root server operators.". That's an acceptable risk (because Verisign is trustworthy and has very little to gain from trying to pull a fast one), but decentralized it ain't.


The author's point though is that creating a Bitcoin clone either results in:
- A centrally managed coin (in which case the blockchain is useless, just have that central institution manage a ledger directly, way cheaper). Like e-gold, but run by a bank or group of banks.
- A decentralized coin that inherits all of bitcoin's flaws/quirks (such as a mathematically managed supply, 51% attack risk, and unbacked units).
So in either case, Bitcoin's innovations aren't something you can easily pick-and-choose from, unlike UBS believes.

Actually, there's some hacks to make it all work if you want to:
1. Split the chain into earth-local and mars-local chains.
2. Add a way to distinguish addresses based on which branch they live on.
3. Sending from a mars address must first be confirmed by a mars local chain. The same applies to the earth-local chain.
4. A block refers to it's parent, and optionally to a block on the alternate chain. This provides the mechanism for sending from one chain to the other.
It's complicated but viable.

There is actually almost no voting in bitcoin.
99% of the rules are enforced by every participant (signature checks, block subsidy limits, etc). Because you can verify them independently, no one needs to vote.
The only thing that can't be verified independently, is the order of transactions, and that is the only thing that miners take care of.
If you dislike the ordering of transactions, you make your own alternate chain of blocks, and somehow convince others to mine on it.
If you dislike anything else, you can change your node's code, and it will happily enforce whatever crazy new rules you come up with. Just don't expect the rest of the world to follow along.

1.  on freenode often is a good place to start
2. You can make this happen using the payment protocol, as it lets you specify more than one receiving address. This won't be compatible with all wallets, but it has the advantage of having payments go straight to Alice and Bob, no need for a middleman.
3.  Bitpay can pay out in bitcoin, fiat or a split between the two. You just need to configure it.

There's a lesson here, but it's already embedded in bitcoin's very core:
Every payment system with a centralized point of control will eventually either conform to all government dictates (no matter how absurd) or get shut down.
Paypal took the former route, e-gold, the latter.
Bitcoin takes the third alternative, that of being incapable of conforming, and (nearly) impossible to shutdown.

It's possible to DDOS a node. It's possible to DDOS multiple nodes.
To fully freeze all payments though, you would need to disrupt most of the mining power in the system, and make it hard for them to communicate with each other.
It's not impossible (unlike what others are saying) but it's very hard to do properly for more than a few minutes (because nodes automatically ban misbehaving peers).
The simplest technique to slow the network to a crawl would actually be to make lots and lots of valid payments. It would end up costing ~$1 per second in transaction fees, and there's very little anyone else could do about it (unless they're willing to outbid the attacker).

I think you're confused about "sharing results". I'll walk you through the attack, but to simplify, let's go with "attacker owns 2 pools with 30% each" (the reasoning is the same though):
1. I am an attacker and I want to orphan the most recent block, let's call it Block 1 (in order to do a double spend).
  - To do so, I set both of my pools to work on creating an alternate block (let's call these Block 1A and Block 1B).
  - The rest of the network is building on top of the longest known chain (so they're building Block 2).
2. There is a 60% chance that one of my pools creates the next block (30% for Block 1A, 30% for Block 1B), before the honest miners create theirs.
  - If Block 1A is found, then my pools start working on Block 2A, and Block 2B, both of which build on top of Block 1A
  - If Block 1B is found, then my pools start working on Block 2A, and Block 2B, both of which build on top of Block 1B
3. Either way, my chain has increased by length 1 (with probability 60%). I can repeat step 2 as many times as necessary until my chain is longer than the honest chain (I should eventually win).
The point is that whoever can dictate:
- The transactions inside the block.
- The parent of the block.
to a majority of miners can execute a double spend, regardless of other restrictions.

2 Problems:
1. Balance is calculated wrong (can over/underestimate) when a mutated form of a sending transaction ends up in the blockchain. [Gavin's working on fixing that]( Apparently, that's what caused Bitstamp to stop withdrawals as well.
2. Wallet used to assume that change outputs (from your own transaction) were safe to spend immediately. Because of malleability, this isn't true: If I get a mutant of your original transaction into the blockchain, all the transactions you made with the original's change output are now invalid. Gavin's [got a patch for detection of the situation]( at the api level, and [there's code to make bitcoin-qt not spend change outputs until they are confirmed]( which entirely sidesteps the problem (at the expense of sometime not being able to send at all).

That's only true if they introduce it through something other than the block reward, otherwise, this makes mining profitable again (drawing private competitors in again).


Right, I'm in agreement that nation-states could only agree to a set of rules that puts none of their interests at risk. The problem isn't that, but rather the fact that (things all major central banks agree on) ⊋ (things that are in all users' interests).
As the simplest example, consider the following rule set:
- Standard bitcoin ruleset +
- Any modification to the ledger can be done, but only with unanimous consent of all member central banks.
Now, this is possibly too strict to work in practice (you'd probably want certain types of actions to require less than unanimity), but no central bank will object to this rule set *on the basis of risks it poses to their interests*, given it gives them veto power over any potentially dangerous action.
Yet in very short order, we'd see the following happen:
- Every owner of an address needs to register such addresses with one of the central banks before being able to send from it.
- Once anonymity is gone, a gentlemen's agreement is reached whereas each central bank can exert unilateral control over addresses its citizens own (and reciprocally allows the same of all others). Because this is verifiable, you effectively split the address space into individually controlled fiefdoms.
- Some central bank does a "bail-in" of all accounts in their control. This doesn't affect anyone the other central banks care about, so it goes through.
- Automatic VAT application on money landing into European addresses.
- Etc.
It doesn't matter if all central banks have a voice if their interests don't properly represent mine or yours. Now maybe there's a game theoretic equilibrium, where central banks incentivize usage of their variant by not giving themselves this power, but with the power to print money they can force you through another hard fork, (by deliberately hyperinflating the pre-hardfork variant after a transition period), as often as needed. Total control by central authorities is the only possible endgame.

Yes. Most mining pools simply don't really pay attention to the software they're running. So a lot of pools are still using the default block size (250KB). That also means that increasing the default will lead to increased block sizes for all these pools.


Depending on how you do it, you can prebroadcast everything except the block header if you want to. That's blazing fast. Even the ID-list approach is much less data (like 1/10^th).


Not really, a block includes transactions by hash. As long as I've seen the version that's in the block (have it in my mempool), I don't need any other info. If I haven't seen it, I can just request it from a peer and verify it as part of the block.


No, more like require a minimum number of transactions for a block to be valid. It's a bad direction to go for a variety of reasons, but it could work as a last ditch resort (50%+ of the hashpower just deciding to mine empty blocks, for example).

The way budget cuts work means that it won't matter:
1. Budgets are cut (or just not increased as much as the executive wants).
2. The shortfall is directed towards those areas where the most visible damage will be done.
  - Monuments are shut down, but security staffing is kept in place to keep people out (as opposed to just no one working).
  - A hospital will keep everyone employed, but shut down the emergency walk-in area, to save on the electrical bill.
  - Fire fighters reduce the size of the fleet that's in operation, to save gas. No labor cuts.
3. Whoever made the cuts is confronted with the devastating political consequences.
4. Budgets are restored to original amount.
This works right up until it doesn't (because there's no borrowing/taxation to put towards running Leviathan). It won't be a pretty outcome for anyone.

My point about [BIPS reporting thefts]( is a clear counterexample. The way I see it, Bitstamp wouldn't lose much if they actually said: "Yep, we've had some small amount stolen using this attack, but we caught it early and shut down". You may choose to believe otherwise.
I made an offer to bet on this, not to shut you up, but because I saw it as a trivial way to make some money. I have a bet with [someone who thinks Dogecoin will have larger USD transaction volume than bitcoin by next year]( and with [someone who thinks Bitstamp will shut down withdrawals again within the month]( When someone's opinion is impressively wrong, and they're not backing down from it, I'll make a bet and profit.

Yes, but the hard part in making a formal spec is that it needs to be compatible with what's out there right now. So a lot of the effort is first going to go towards fixing up the client's behaviour to be completely describable, and only then to attempting to describe it.
For example, the March 2013 fork wouldn't have been predicted from a formal spec, because it was caused by a detail in one of the libraries used by the reference client.

Do you have a good primer you can link me to? I want to do some reading, and I'd rather get the best argued form of the idea than wade through stupid stuff first (Sturgeon's law: 90% of everything is crap). I'm especially interested in answers to the following:
- Where is the line drawn for acceptable behaviour? Can I take over an unoccupied house that hasn't been used in a month? How about while the current occupant is out for a weekend, or just for groceries? What about while they're still inside? I'm interested in how that line is drawn up and justified.
- Is the objection to the violence used in enforcing private property, or to the consequences of private property? Because bitcoin *does* and smart property *may* allow for private property that doesn't need violence for enforcement (by making possession be a mental, rather than physical thing). Is that regarded as good or bad?
- If it's ok for me to take possession of something, and it's ok to break things I possess, what's the moral reasoning against walking around a neighborhood, smashing windows of any building I could legitimately squat?
As far as SWAT teams being used in evicting squatters, I'll leave it at these two facts:
- Most SWAT team usage in the Maryland (the only state with stats) is used to [serve search warrants]( That's a massive potential reduction in violence that both sides can agree on before we start squabbling.
- In Spain, if squatters took over your property, and you try change the locks or even just gain entry [**you** are guilty of trespassing, and hence criminally liable](
    
    &gt; **Can’t I just walk in and change the locks to my property?**
    &gt;
    &gt;No. On squatters taking over your property, you lose material possession of it. Meaning should you attempt to enter it, despite a property being rightfully lodged under your name at the land registrar and you paying all utility bills and even mortgage repayments, it will be regarded as ‘illegal trespassing’ for which you can – and will – be legally prosecuted.
    &gt;
    &gt;I strongly advise you to seek legal advice prior to taking a rash decision that may land you in a Spanish jail.
    State violence isn't just going in one direction.

I'm not trolling. The disagreements were layered, and simply quoting something juicy in the middle of the discussion does not support your point:
- The original standard (before BIP39 was even a thing), enforced a single wordlist, and generated a passphrase with a built in checksum. It was a great design, but other wallet implementers wanted alternative word lists.
- To support alternative word lists, there were a few possible techniques. The simplest was to make each wordlist completely incompatible with each other. This was unpalatable to almost everyone. The solution that slush and prusnak pushed instead was to use the wordlist not as an encoding, but rather as a seed for hashing.
  - The original idea was random number &lt;=&gt; passphrase (including checksum)
  - It became random number =&gt; passphase (including checksum) =&gt; hash of passphrase
- This worked ok, but has 2 main problems:
  - If the wordlist used to generate the passphrase isn't one the software/hardware you're typing it into supports, then no checksum calculation is possible.
  - It can be used as a brainwallet, which *everyone* agrees is a bad idea.
- After much discussion, the standard was updated to *require* warning the user if the checksum can't be checked (something their implementation was doing, but wasn't mentionned). Some people wanted to go further, but the problem is that this meant passphrases generated with a deprecated wordlist would become incompatible with other wallets (and the whole point of the standard was interoperability).
- Roughly at this point, Peter Todd suggest redoing the design from scratch: move validation out of the "random number =&gt; passphrase" part and into the "passphrase =&gt; hash" part (the checksum grinding proposal). This has 1 advantage: Typing an invalid passphrase can be spotted even by a wallet which has no notion of what the original wordlist was. It however requires more implementation complexity, increase the cpu cost of generating the seed (and can't give you any level of error *correction*, unlike a wordlist would).
- A minor flame war breaks out.
- Bitcoin-core lead dev steps in to clarify that the pull request can be pulled in (since it doesn't change the draft to accepted), and that the flaming should continue on the main development list.

Ok, so you believe that Bitstamp wouldn't report a breach if one happened, even after things were resolved, and as such the bet is unworkable. Fair enough, there's no point arguing that out further, and I don't blame you (and never did either) for not taking the bet.
For the rest:


That is provably false. Any wallet whose code is available online handles this at least semi-competently. Bitcoin-qt has some issues, but there is no known wallet code with problems equivalent to what MtGox ran into. Which makes sense because MtGox is the only one running a fully custom proprietary wallet (written in PHP, lol).
Beyond that, had other exchanges relied on txids, they would have shut down withdrawals immediately after reading MtGox's announcement. Even if you assume they're fundamentaly dishonest about being vulnerable, it would be easy for them to shut down immediately, fix the problem, and bring it back up the following day, all while blaming MtGox for making them stop withdrawals: *we read there was a vulnerability, and took them at their word, we turned everything back on after we realized everything was fine*. The fact that they didn't is an indication that they legitimately thought they weren't affected by malleability.
The timing of their shutdowns and of the bitcoind-related issues being opened in the bitcoin github project indicates that they fell prey to the other vulnerabilities (wrong balances specifically). [This is entirely consistent with their press release](


Except Bitstamp's withdrawals are batched, which means they wouldn't be vulnerable in the same way (even if they had used txids internally). They don't give you a txid when you withdraw, and they group withdrawals into one single transaction (and I strongly suspect they're using bitcoind to do it).
You'd have a harder time convincing them your payment didn't go through (since no other person would be reporting it), and they'd empty their hot wallet a lot faster if you did pull it off since they'd be resending the entire transaction.
This means that if Bitstamp had been vulnerable you'd expect them to notice first (before MtGox) because they'd drain their own funds faster AND because any transaction malleability attack would cause them to double withdraw to non-attackers' wallets as well (and odds are one of them would report it at some point).


[We have evidence that the widespread attacks started after MtGox's announcement]( This leads me to believe that the original attacker had done some small scale testing, found that gox (and only gox) was vulnerable, and proceeded to drain the wallets slowly to avoid getting caught. Then MtGox shut down, investigated and announced their findings.
This leads to copycats trying to attack every remaining exchange (because free money). They fail, but manage to DOS some of them in the process by messing up bitcoind's accounting.
I do believe this version fits the facts better.

It's impossible to know for sure that a particular set of cryptographic primitives is not backdoored (you can't prove a negative).
- Generating new coins out of thin air is impossible without getting you to change the client you're running, or exploiting a bug in it. It is trivial to enforce.
- To steal coins would require backdooring/breaking ECC crypto. To do so would also make you capable of accessing all private information that is shared over SSL. So a break in that is the end of all internet security, not just bitcoin's.

The only reason for that is because there hasn't been an update to the hardcoded fee policy since the price 10x'ed. Not because of any fundamental constraints.

Trezor allows easy backups. All you have to do is store a piece of paper to recover all the funds ever stored on it.
So you need to both lose the hardware and the paper backup (which you can photocopy and store in multiple places). I somehow doubt this is a real problem. People already keep multiple copies of important documents in safe deposit boxes, I don't think this is much harder.

No, you're wrong. Unless merchants also upgrade to the new inflata-coin, I can still continue using my bitcoins with them. The only issue we'll have is that blocks will be 10 times slower for a while.
In fact, even if they upgrade I'll still be able to send them my old bitcoins (the how and why is a little messy, so I won't go into details), and they'll see it as a valid payment.
Money going the other way (funds created from the new inflation premium) will not work however. If I'm using old bitcoin, people trying to send me funds that include the newly minted coins (that are not valid on my branch) won't be able to.
From the perspective of old nodes, the fork would look like a bunch of hashpower just disappearing, and some weird invalid transactions and blocks being seen once in a while. Everyone who didn't upgrade would otherwise be just fine.

Sorry, it seems like we're talking past each other.
You think that letting the on network transactions grow is something negative, and that it's entirely better if things happen off-chain. You're willing to compromise by letting the block size limit grow a bit, but it's clear you think it plays some useful role.
I think that artificially making blockchain space scarce simply stifle bitcoin's growth, forcing people to use suboptimal transaction mechanisms to avoid ever rising fees is a incredibly effective way to kill off bitcoin. If bitcoin's not capable of handling a $0.10 purchase, that may not be the end of the world, but if Peter Todd's vision of $20 fees/transaction comes true, no one will use bitcoin (good luck with it being a store of value then).
The reason I brought up the block size limit's history is precisely because it isn't some kind of feature baked into the protocol. It was meant to be an anti-DOS measure until real transaction volumes picked up and the risk of someone making a 1GB block full of valid but bogus transactions disappeared. I believe we've reached that stage a year ago.

The state declared drugs are illegal. They kept their value (or even become more valuable).
Zimbabwe dictated the price of bread should stay low, even as it printed ever more currency. Bread became so precious that you couldn't find it anywhere at the regulated prices.


The PRC and ROC would like a word about that little misconception. Once a violent group can exclude all others, it *is* authorized, by the only authority that matters: its own.


The value of something is exactly what causes people to acquire it. You may argue bitcoin's perceived value to be a mirage, but the core point is that trade is an indication that someone cares to have it.

The hashrate is increasing at 1.5% per day right now. Long before we see 90% of hashrate drop out, we'll first see a slowdown in growth.
Even if it were to happen, pools aren't monolithic entities. If the hashrate drops by a factor of 10:
- Statistically speaking, all pools will be affected equally (because the people who own the least profitable hardware will be roughly equally distributed).
- Even if somehow all the profitable miners all were members of one pool, they'll switch pools and redistribute the hash rate. This isn't theoretical, it happens everytime a pool gets close to 50%.
- Even if this isn't a pool (let's say Asicminer has a giant datacenter and suddenly ends up with 51%), the rational thing is to mine honestly, because otherwise all that specialized hardware is worthless.
- Even if Asicminer chooses evil over profit, the community can just hardfork to a new proof of work function to negate their influence.
If things get bad enough that we have a sudden sustained 90% hashrate drop, we're probably doomed, but not because of the miners.

It would make the task a little easier if you asked specific questions. Here's a first attempt:
Bitcoins are already easier and cheaper to transact with online than credit cards. This advantage will only increase over time.
Eventually, as bitcoins become easier to store securely, and their value becomes more stable, most people will feel comfortable holding a small amount of bitcoin. At which point we can expect it to take over for online transactions, replacing credit cards. After that, who knows?

A merchant can wait for *n* confirmations. That will always correspond to the same level of security. It's just that the expected time for a merchant on Mars ends up being *n* * 10 minutes + 2 * speed of light delay to earth.
Zero conf is also entirely unsafe, as an attacker can trivially schedule a machine to double-spend on earth right as he submits a transaction to the merchant. It would then take 4-20 minutes before the merchant even noticed.
This is unfortunately a physics problem rather than a design issue with bitcoin. The only thing that could work is a separate chain for mars-to-mars transactions, with the miners operating locally. Tricky to get right.

By definition, investing into other criminal activities will not launder the funds. The goal of laundering is to make it look like your revenues are coming from legitimate businesses.

No, you've got that backwards:
1. Make a set of transactions
2. Compute merkle root.
3. Put that in a header.
4. Hash the header.
5. If that hash isn't low enough, change the nonce in the header, then go back to 4.
6. Valid block! Publish!
Now the trick is that because steps 4&amp;5 are really, really fast (&gt; 10^15 times per second at current rates), but have a microscopic chance of success, you basically lose nothing by changing the set of transactions and restarting from step 1.
So most mining pools will modify their blocks in near real time, *while* the miners are trying to find the valid nonce. They also keep track of all blocks they've sent out to miners in the recent past.

Kinda. Right now the reward is 25BTC, then in 2016 it becomes 12.5 BTC and so on. In 2140 it's so small it gets rounded down to zero. The transaction fees always go to the miner. Right now those constitute about ~0.05 per block, but it's expected the total will increase as more and more people make transactions.


The blockchain is exactly that: a chain of blocks, where each one builds on top of the last one.
The way miners work is they choose what block to build on top of, and what transactions to include in their new block. The way nodes decide which series of blocks is the correct one is by looking at the longest chain of blocks. So if I can make new blocks faster than everyone else put together, I can alway make the longest chain, and therefore I control what the nodes on the network will consider the real chain.

Before bitcoin was created, people were trying to make peer-to-peer payment systems. The problem they kept running into is: how do you keep Alice from sending $5 to Bob and the same $5 to Charlie? No one could figure out how to do it without having someone in charge of declaring "Bob's transaction came first, so he gets the money".
Basically in order for things to work, everyone on the network needs to agree on an ordering of transactions.
The way mining works is that transactions are grouped, and then a bunch of busywork must be done in order to make a valid block. The blocks then build on top of each other.
That way everyone can look at the series of blocks, and agree on the fact that since the payment to Bob got into a block first, he got the money, not Charlie. In fact only one of the two transactions will ever make it in.

It's somewhat complicated. This approach is really only to make sure that the transaction was broadcast properly (a well-behaved client would submit to merchant and then broadcast the transaction once it got through as well), even if the client device is not connecting properly.
Double spend mitigation is another matter entirely. 0.9 addresses the simple form of double spend (broadcasting conflicting transactions) by rebroadcasting all attempted double spends (rather than silently ignoring them). This means, [given the current propagation speeds on the network]( that the merchant would only need to wait 3-4 seconds after receiving and broadcasting payment to be pretty damn sure he's got his funds.

Nah, it's fine. The only thing someone can do with a qr code of your address is:

- Try and trace the bitcoins that were sent there.
None of these is all that dangerous.
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:34:20
Three things would limit the damage:
- Really small outputs are non standard, so they wouldn't get relayed. You'd have to make your outputs bigger to get them relayed.
- Mempools (that hold unconfirmed transactions) tend to drop lowest priority/fee transactions first. So you might increase everyone's ram usage, but not to the point of getting anyone else's transactions bumped off.
- It would be extremely hard to get the transaction into a block, because no rational miner would bother. If you mine the transaction yourself, all you're doing is bloating the blockchain, and hard-drive space is cheap.
It's not an unfeasible attack, just not very damaging.

Here's a reasonable argument. Of course the reason we have sucky bandwidth in the US and Canada is because local governments cut deals with cable/phone providers where they were granted local monopolies in exchange for covering the entire area. Cities that are new enough not to have made such arrangements get much better service.


The california electrical disaster is [more complicated than simple deregulation](
- The existing electrical companies were forced to sell off about a third of their production capacity to third parties (including Enron). This monopoly-breaking was supposed to create more competition.
- They were also forbidden to enter into long term contracts with these newly created power generators. They were forced to buy power on the one-day-ahead-only market created by the california government.
- This being california, almost no extra capacity could be built within the state itself, due to environmental regulations.
- The electricity distributors could not raise electrical rates to end users without regulatory approval. This meant they couldn't decrease usage by using peak pricing.
- They were forbidden from cuting off power when there was a sudden peak in demand or drop in supply. They were instead forced to buy from the third party providers at whatever price was demanded. This is how Enron made most of their money: their customers were legally forced to purchase their product, regardless of what the price was.

Depositor is a subcategory of creditor. [The distinction is that they tend to have the highest priority in a bankruptcy case in many jurisdictions](
Deposit insurance is something *on top of* merely having a claim on the company's assets. [And it does exist for bitcoin, if you're willing to pay for it](
It is not clear at all if from the perspective of bankruptcy court, a BTC IOU counts as any kind of deposit OR liability at all. I suspect no one really wants to take a chance on it, hence the massive preference for USD.

My understanding is that if the chain code is setup properly, and you're using it in a predictable way, the recipient wallet could look ahead by a few steps.
Then as long as you're not leaving huge gaps (which you wouldn't in this use case), they could see payments being forwarded without notification.

If the world suddenly went on an ice cream binge, you'd be retarded to predict a drowning epidemic. Causation does matter.
Hash rate is going up because:
- The block reward is ~5x more valuable than in September.
- More efficient miners are coming online (more hashrate for the same $ amount).
- Backorders of miners that were ordered last year are getting shipped now.

*Current miner revenue* is 30USD per transaction. That's very different from cost.
When you want to calculate how many miners will drop out (since that seems to be your worry), you need to look at marginal cost of keeping the unit running. That is essentially the electrical cost of the unit.
If you do the math, you'll see the electrical cost of mining $1 of BTC is about $0.20 at current rates on a recent-ish ASIC. So mining revenue can drop by a factor of 5 and we won't lose much hashrate at all. Of course, since the block reward is only halving in 2 years, we're no where near that.

Bitcoin doesn't depend on Tor.
There are reasons to believe that satoshi used Tor and other tools to help keep his identity secret, but that's about it.
As far as we know the second bitcoin miner (and the first person to receive a transaction) was Hal Finney. [Here's some of what he had to say about it](
Almost everyone involved in the very early days were members of the cypherpunks mailing list. It's there that many of bitcoin's predecessors (which never made it past the drawing board) were designed and published, it's there that satoshi first published his whitepaper, it's there that the binaries were distributed as well.

Having 51% of the hashing power means that you can make a chain faster than the rest of the network, combined.


If I want to block a specific set of transactions, all I have to do is not include them in my blocks **and** never build on top of a block that does. What that means is that if the other 49% make a block with the blocked transaction, that block would eventually get orphaned by my chain, because it would grow faster than the honest chain.


If I have 51%, and I don't like the last day's worth of blocks I just go and start a new chain on top of the blocks before that. Eventually my chain is longer than the original + whatever other people added, and so my version of history becomes the real one. I can do this arbitrarily far into the past.


Yes, blocks are created every 10 minutes, this doesn't change. The mining reward decreases, but all other aspects of the system stay the same.

Some suggestions I've seen that can work:
1. Modify the hash function to operate over more than just the header. This enforces that every miner has a copy of the UTXO (and therefore is capable of doing its own transaction inclusion, making big pools harmless).
2. Encourage all pools to switch to only supporting GetBlockTemplate. Again, this protects against 51%, because they no longer dictate what blocks can or can't be built by their miners.
3. Engage in block witholding attacks against any pool that reaches a certain size.
None of these are easy, but they're not impossible either. It's just that no one will want to push radical changes, if smaller ones are sufficient.

But you *can* have a nation with open-borders and no welfare: That was the default state of things for the entire 19th century.
By historical standards, the closed-border welfare state is the anomaly, and it certainly isn't less realistic to modify what's currently in place by abolishing forcible redistribution of wealth (which is getting increasingly obsoleted by black markets), than completely overhauling it (and still maintaining the violent border enforcement and infrigment on freedom of movement that it continues to imply).
Remember, this part of the comment thread is in response to [**your** defense of the morality of the welfare state]( *Of course* we're going to attack the basis of your argument that a welfare state is necessary, and the only debate worth having is what form it will take. We profoundly disagree with your handwaving away of the real substantive questions:
- Why do we have a welfare state?
- Does it really benefit the poor? 
- Is a welfare state even sustainable?
For those of us who see the welfare state as inefficient, violent and immoral, the GMI is just putting lipstick on a pig.

Also, once you have a welfare state, you inevitably close the borders to most immigration (because now having poor people move in can bankrupt you).
So in the name of helping the indigent western poor (who get to live like kings by global standards), we also deny the global working poor their chance to come here and significantly improve their living conditions (Moving a Haitian to the U.S. easily increases his output by a factor of twenty.) without costing us a dime.

We got quite lucky.
Obviously most bitcoin-related websites were affected (but the actual damage done was limited AFAIK).
The bigger risk was leaking of private keys by bitcoin nodes, and there were 2 main ways this could have happened:
- People using the RPC interface, making it accessible from outside their own network, and enabling SSL on it.
- People using the payment protocol.
Because the payment protocol *just* started rolling out recently, and most wallets don't support it yet, it would have been hard for an attacker to try and steal keys.
But if the vulnerability had been found, say, 6 months from now, a dedicated attacker could have tricked a lot of users into clicking a seemingly innocuous payment link, and gotten sensitive information (up to and including private keys, theoretically).

Generally credit card fees include a base fee. This can be as high as 30 cents for online purchases.
Very large mechants can and do negotiate better terms for themselves, so I suspect McD's can do a better.
For your questions:
1. Unlike all other systems, bitcoin fees are set and paid by the consumer. Economics dictates that it doesn't really matter who officially pays the fee, the cost ends up being spread the same way.
2. In theory the consumer sets the fee, and miners decide whether to include the transaction or not in their blocks. In practice the fees mostly just follow the defaults set by the wallet developers. There is work in progress to make this process more seamless, and to remove the need for the dev team to set defaults. Anyone can lower fees by mining and not requiring fees.
3. The plan is that there will be more and more transactions. If the number of transactions grows faster than the fee paid by each falls, mining can remaing profitable forever.

That's already happening. I meant agressive recruitment of investors/customers. Or do you see any "doge-only" merchants?


More is always better, but we've raised lots of money for a variety of charities. Just take a look at bitcoin100.org and the work they've done, Seans' outpost, the bitgive foundation. Bitpay gives free fiat conversions to all registered nonprofits.
The distinction is that Dogecoin specifically targets causes that get eyeballs. That's something I'd rather not do, because it makes a mockery of charity, turning it into advertising.


I agree, and so do the devs, which is why the floating fees update will help make that happen. But sub-penny payments to humans are just spam. Spending time to redeem them pays less than minimum wage. They're wonderful if your goal is to recruit people by looking generous though. Our bot has a 20c minimum, and I don't think that's a bad thing for the sake of despamming threads.


I agree a nicer community would be nice to have. I think you overestimate the importance of this group relative to the bitcoin ecosystem though. This is were the BTC junkies end up congregating, not exactly the center of recruitment efforts. Look a bitcoin.org for honest recruitment done right. We hide the download links because we want to educate the user, so they don't get hurt.


That was never my statement. Dogecoin combines a wonderfully friendly community and lighthearted attitude (which are nice) with the nasty scammy stuff that reminds me of scamcoins. The overall effect creeps me out. Dogecoin is the Stepford Wives of cryptocurrency.

No. What it would do is make a single transaction that uses the 5 and the 0.5 as inputs, and would produce two outputs, one with 5.1 (going to the merchant address) and one with 0.4 (going to a change address you control).
Think of it like gold nuggets. Each output is a fixed amount of value. To send X, your wallet takes as many outputs as necessary so that their total, Y is more than X, "melts" them down together, and breaks that into one chunk for the merchant (size X), and one chunk going back to you (Y - X).
[This is what it looks like, with two inputs being used](
The wallet manages all of it so you never have to think about it.

Cookies and BTC. I'd have to fly there, sorry.
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:33:10
You have the causation entirely backwards:
- Transaction fees are a near-perfectly competitive market. Customers set the fees they want to pay, miners can only choose which transactions to include in their block.
- The inflation subsidy is preprogrammed and decreases over time.
- (The total fees in a block + the transaction subsidy) * (BTC price) = overall miner revenue.
- Again, because mining is near-perfectly competitive, mining costs increase to match the available revenues.
So when you see hash rate growing faster than total transaction fees, all it means is that mining is going to get a lot less profitable, **not** that transaction fees will go up.
If you don't believe me, try working out how mining costs affect transaction costs, and you'll see there's no mechanism.

I disagree, but this is well written, and thus deserves a detailed response:
You jump straight to assuming that central banks will try to co-opt bitcoin. Not build a competitor, not ban it, but jump on board and take over. And that they'll do this in a coordinated fashion. While no one can predict the future, I suspect the response, will 1) be a lot less accomodating at first and 2) not be coordinated worldwide, or even amongst a few countries.
China cares about capital controls. China and Japan want a lot more than 2% price inflation (for economic policy reasons). Germany is more hard-money friendly. The US has a lot to lose by joining in a scheme to unseat their own currency as the world reserve currency, and so on.
The combination of initial hostility (already demonstrated) and lack of unity (reasonably extrapolable from historical behaviour) will undermine co-opting attempts.
**If** the central banks agree to co-opt bitcoin by changing the software, taking over hashing power is useless. Instead you'd switch to a consensus model with 1 vote per central bank. If you're going to introduce trust in the system, might as well take advantage of the efficiency benefits thereof. It also has the advantage of making attackers' behaviour very public (because they sign blocks). Also mining at a loss, combined with 2% monetary inflation, means you're burning a ton of energy (even moreso if you're talking about price inflation). It also means 0 revenue from seignorage, which isn't great for you.
Of course, that presupposes that they'd be in a position to redefine the bitcoin software and protocol, and I do believe that is the weakest part of the argument. Most people trust the more competent central banks with monetary policy, but no one expects them to be able to build software or hire people who can (witness the IT disaster of the PPACA in the US). The average Joe may trust a central bank with the power to print money, but would they trust their ability to build/audit/run good software?
The trust problem also goes far deeper than this: Bitcoin is just a ledger system. Trusting a group with the power to change that ledger doesn't stop at currency creation, but extends to seizing accounts (partially or entirely), reversing transactions, and so on. Even if I trust the current group, do I trust their successors, or the people who can apply political pressure on them (stop terrorist financing!)?
More importantly the people most willing to adopt bitcoin are the ones who most embrace its current feature set. This is true even when half the planet is using it: they're likely to be the half that favors anonymity/hard money/no central controls the most. Therefore, attempts at redefining bitcoin will have the most success with people who don't use it, and the least with whoever is using it.
Which brings me to my last point: A hard-fork (which is what we're talking about) is always optional to the end user. They can easily continue to use bitcoin according to the original rules (in fact they can have their cake and eat it too, using pre-*and*-post fork coins separately). Bitcoin-original can and will maintain a large userbase (ideologically motivated, admittedly) which in turns means *every* previous user can continue using the old coins (at some fraction of the original value, based on how demand splits up). Moreover, Gresham's law says people will prefer to hold the original-bitcoins and spend the new-bitcoins (which are expected to inflate), further driving the value split in favor of old-bitcoin.
In the end an attempt at co-opting bitcoin looks a lot like starting an alt from scratch, except you also give a bunch of free money to the early adopters (by encouraging all the non-adopters to join in and buy existing coins). That seems like a bad idea.

Actually, many forms of failure would be temporary, and could be recovered from. The hardfork in March is a good example.
Anything short of allowing spending of other people's money could be fixed by updating the codebase.

This could be devastating to confidence, especially if lots of real losses occured.

Don't put words in my mouth please.
Bans and regulation are very distinct from thinking in terms of "this competes with our currency system, we better up our game".
The bans and the regulations are just a continuation of the same approach that led to the shutdown of e-gold and other bitcoin predecessors. It reflects the governments' extremely risk adverse approach to all new developments. Note that they didn't decide to "roll their own" after such actions, because the threat was gone.
The only thing that's different *this time*, is the fact that there are no leaders to throw in jail. Maybe they'll decide to actually compete in the marketplace, but there's no precedent for such an action, and there's a lot more institutional inertia stopping it.
I believe we'll see bans long before we see substitutes.

It depends how good of a deal they can get, and how deep in the hole MtGox is.
If it's 750,000 BTC, then no way is anyone sane going to touch that with a ten foot pole.
If that's bogus, and MtGox is, say, ~$10 Million in the hole, is acquired for a pittance, the new owners pay back everyone, throw out the old code and people, and start over from scratch, I can see that strategy working out.
The value wouldn't be in the actual entity MtGox, but in the publicity stunt and the goodwill it generates with the community. Risky, but possible.
I'm still skeptical anything like that will happen.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:41:49
Petitions don't work. You might as well sacrifice goats.
The foundation's in a pickle because MtGox is a founding member, which means they can only be removed for cause (Insanity, Felony, or no longer in operation).

Trezors are auditable. Their behaviour (after initial key generation) is entirely deterministic, and therefore, while you can't check that the code it's running is the one you expect, you *can* verify that all inputs and outputs correspond to what it's supposed to do.
Even the initial master key generation process includes user-provided entropy in a deterministic way.
So as long as the assumption is that entire batches of devices are going to be compromised, you can safely assume that a few people doing audits will catch abnormal behaviour.

Another option is that the contracts are still denominated in USD, with the actual payments being in BTC. Then Alice has no risk to hedge, and Overstock only has to worry about hedging their BTC float (which needn't be very large).

You're missing a step:
1. Make all financial institutions report large cash transactions. This helps catch people with ill-gotten gains.
2. Make it a crime to try to get around 
The combination of these two makes the cash worth a lot less, because it becomes a huge hassle to buy anything with it. Professional launderers will charge a very large percentage to "clean" the money. This decreases, but does not eliminate, the incentive to commit crimes.
It's not a perfect system, but it works. We've survived just fine before it was in place, so really it's just a nice to have. Frankly I don't think it's worth the ever more draconian measures we've seen implemented.

They'll only dump their USD/Fiat. That's about 3-5% of world assets. Satoshi's wealth would be huge, but last time I did the math it worked out to about twice as big as the Walton family. Not even insane by modern standards, and well short of Rockefeller at his maximum.
If the central bank manages the exodus properly, it can also shrink the money supply to keep the value of dollars relatively constant. This would require fiscal discipline and the retirement of debt, but it's theoretically doable.
The real assets of people (labor, real estate, material goods, equity) would not be affected. They'd probably need to renegotiate their contracts to receive Bitcoin instead of whatever local fiat currency, but otherwise they wouldn't be affected.

- Click on payment link.
- Wallet opens, asks to confirm the sent amount.
- Press ok, type password or pin (if applicable).
- Click confirm on website.
Credit card
- Open payment form
- Fill form (hopefully you have autofill set).
- Copy secret bits from credit card (CC security code and expiration data) that your browser refuses to save (for good reason).
- Click ok.
- If they have MasterCard SecureCode, or Verified by Visa, prepare to enter more emails and passwords, reconfirm the payment.

The net neutrality advocates need to stop selling their position using FUD.
I realize you see overlap with the bitcoin community, but this article is completely stupid. It starts with the non-existing example of Youtube throttling:


This has never happened. Ever. The closest thing is some cable provider CEOs saying they reserve the right to do so, and one agreement in France where google pays extra for the youtube traffic over an ISP's network (which constitutes 50% of their total traffic).
Then assumes the all powerful *evil cable korporashuns* will somehow expand this non-existent example to bitcoin traffic, and throws in CableCoin! Seriously?

Most pools' bitcoind instance IPs are not public, because it would make it too easy to DDOS them. Their mining servers are public.
But your overall understanding is correct.


It's not first come first serve strictly speaking. Miners are free to fill the blocks they make however they want. It's just that actively accepting and mining double spends (it's not something you'd do by accident), would land a pool in hot water.

Overstock's use of bitcoin+conversion to fiat is more in direct competition with credit cards than with the US dollar.
The milestones until we can really call this a competitior to national currencies:
1. Start displacing paypal.
2. Start displacing credit cards online.
3. Start displacing credit cards in meatspace.
4. Start displacing cash in meatspace.

Their questions are going to be a bunch of ELI5 softballs + the same law enforcement concerns we've heard over and over again. Gavin will give them his explanations for the former &amp; the usual scripted foundation answers on the latter.

If you're running a full node, you're already verifying transactions for yourself.
@_date: 2014-08-29 13:03:05
Ok, then your solution is essentially the same as the current relay policies. The first version of a transaction wins, and conflicting transactions are not relayed.
Double spenders get around this sometimes by broadcasting 2 transactions at once, sometimes by working with a miner that guarantees inclusion of their transactions, even if it is a double spend, and sometimes by crafting transactions that will be rejected by some subset of miners, so that the double spend isn't detected as such by them and they work on it, totally oblivious to what happened.
None of those can be fixed simply by appending a timestamp. The race attack requires using/abusing your "too far in the past" rule. The other 2 are fundamentally unfixable.

As long as the deflation rate is lower than the real interest rate, the nominal interest rate can be adjusted. It happens all the time for inflationary currencies.
I'm a bank who wants to lend out deposits and make a 5% real return.
- If the currency is neutral, I charge 5%.
- If the currency inflates at 8%, I charge 13%
- If the currency deflates at 3%, I charge 2%
For me, and for the borrower, all these arrangements are identical.
Bitoin won't be suitable for lending if, in the long run:
- Deflation stays really high.
- Deflation never becomes predictable.

It's funny people take "barriers to entry" =&gt; "monopoly" as a given in economics but not politics. The gulf between our perspectives may be too big to bridge.
We libertarians have always been few in number and willing to spend outsized amounts to be heard. We've been blocked at every opportunity by all organs of state power, [including the FEC]( and other election control organs (which are universally controlled by bipartisan groups ie. people who really don't want third parties to take hold). Your system is a way to tell political minorities that they better get used to being sidelined permanently. I'm not sure why you think you'll get a good reception here.
If your legislative proposal gets passed my tax dollars will be subsidizing the re-election of politicians who support the drug war, permanent overseas occupation, and further infringment upon our fundamental rights.

The harder I work, the more I materially support the permanent embedding of these policies. Thanks.
Thankfully, it's getting too late for you to get your wish of a permanently embedded political class. The US is going to have to tighten its belt significantly (especially as the black market grows), which makes public financing a no-go.

@_date: 2014-02-14 05:24:22


It's not that you can't, rather that if you do, and someone mutates your transaction, your payment using that change will fail.


Even without malleability, it isn't safe for a merchant to accept transactions that use zero-conf inputs. That lets you build long chains of unconfirmed transactions on top of each other, and you then can try and stop the confirmation of any of the intermediates, which stops the payment to the merchant.
Ideally a wallet that sees heavy usage can try to keep multiple reasonably sized outputs handy. That is in fact what they generally do once you use them enough. That way you nearly always have ready outputs to spend. This is an unexplored topic in wallet design, but I think it will need to be addressed over time.

It stopped because the way the transaction was designed, it was non-standard (lots of 1-Satoshi output). No node would relay or mine it.

Probably not.


1. File a bug with the wallet devs. This is something they'll want to prevent in the future.
2. The easiest thing to do is probably to take your KryptoKit private keys, import them into another wallet, and try sending the transaction using that wallet. Odds are most nodes will happily take the second spend, because the previous one was malformed.

This point is often repeated. It seems critics look at the current monetary system, see its complexity, and assume such complexity is a necessary feature. That seems ahistorical to me: 
- For multiple millenia, money was shiny, rare and mostly useless metals. Say what you will about precious metals, they're not very complicated.
- Most of the paper money in history (until recently) was simply pegged to some amount of precious metals. The only complexities involved were those involved in making fractional backing work acceptably, and that wasn't necessary, just a really nice way to generate money for the state through seignorage.
- Cultures with no access to precious metals often used [shells]( and other durable animal products as money.
- Prisons, where private exchange using the local fiat cannot happen, will fall back to the next best thing. That used to be cigarettes, but as those get phased out in certain prisons, [prisonners will use the next best alternatives]( whatever they may be.
You may be able to make the case that a complicated monetary system is strictly *better*, but that's very distinct from saying it is the only option. More importantly, just like the prison situation, online black/grey markets need something to serve as money. Even if bitcoin is absolutely worse as a currency than the USD (heh), it still has a niche that only it can fill.

"The pot splits the next time a block whose hash is divisible by 32 is published (based on the block timestamp)"

In theory, doing it by hand is possible. The bitcoin-qt command line will let you do this, although it's not user friendly.
It's a lot of bytes (Anywhere from ~300 to ~4000 bytes). The standard hex encoding means twice that many characters, and no error correction. So not practical in any sense of the word.

Actually, no. Certain changes require only a majority of miners agree. This change however would get rejected by all full nodes still running the old code.
This means that as long as you're running a version of bitcoin that doesn't allow for more than 21,000,000 coins, your node will reject any blocks or transactions existing on a parallel branch without that limit.

You're close, not quite.
There are only transactions and blocks.
Each transaction is a set of inputs and outputs:
- The outputs are just amounts with an indication of who's allowed to spend them (the address).
- The inputs are nothing more than previous transactions' outputs, with a proof that you're allowed to use them (a digital signature).
Here's an example transaction: 
It has 2 inputs, and has digital signatures to prove the person who wrote the transaction owned the associated addresses. It has 2 outputs, which is where the value from the inputs is sent.
A block is just a bunch of transactions put together, with a reference to a previous block. This blockchain effectively is how we know what transactions happened in what order in the system, and how double-spends are prevented. It is innovation that makes bitcoin viable.

My bad, I wasn't clear:
- Fee is one factor that affects relaying/inclusion in blocks.
- The other is *priority*, which is computed based on size and age of the inputs to the transaction.
- A *high priority* transaction doesn't require a fee in order to get relayed. IsStandard is the check used by nodes, and it enforces a minimum fee for transactions that *aren't high priority*.
- Armory will not let you create a *low priority* transaction without including a fee.


If it's anything like the problems i've seen, the transaction likely wasn't properly sent to your bitcoinqt in the first place, or your bitcoin-qt somehow decided not to relay it. There's no reason to believe it would be rejected by new nodes.

Some clarification:
A wallet is composed of a set of private keys. Each private key has its own address.
As long as you're using a wallet where you control the keys (any mobile or desktop wallet, blockchain.info, but **not** Coinbase, exchange wallets and the like), any address you send from is an address that you can safely receive at.
If you want people to pay you, I'd still recommend making a new receiving address everytime. That helps maintain your privacy.
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:47:56
Bitcoin-qt is, quite frankly, awful at backups. You need to make new backups every 100 transactions or so, because of how its key pool mechanism works.
I'd really recommend Armory if your computer can run it. Encrypted by default, a single paper backup is good forever. It uses bitcoind in the background, so you're still using a real full node, but with a better wallet. I only have good things to say about it.

Well, I'm a minarchist (on good days), so I mostly recognize the inevitability of some form of government, and treat creating one as a necessary evil.
The trap most people fall into is that they treat these things as platonic ideals. Government, on paper, would seem to give you the following:
- A reliable final arbiter for disputes (civil courts).
- A set of rules that are predictable and uniform (law).
- Protection against those who do not wish to respect such rules (police), and those who would impose different rules (defense).
This is what a historical small government looks like. Sometimes other things will get thrown on top:
- Correction of market inefficiencies due to externalities (pollution restrictions, copyright/patent law, anti-trust legislation).
- Enforcement of morality (drug war, prohibition, anti-prostitution laws).
- Education, Healthcare, and other "public goods".
- Welfare/Social safety net.
On all counts, most modern governments have proven themselves not just incompetent but malicious. Taking the topics in reverse order:
- The "welfare trap" is well documented (as you want to replace it with GMI, I assume you know the story).
  - Social Security was designed, from day one, as a system for intergenerational theft and revenue creation (which is why it only invests in government bonds).
  - In Poland, the government has started seizing control of pension funds (not outright theft, but transfer of custodianship), to help increase its balance sheet, in order to be able to borrow more.
- Most public goods aren't actually so (the positive externalities of most health services, except vaccination and treatment of contagious diseases, are small, same for education). Even if they were, the means by which the government encourages provision of such goods is positively terrible.
  - Public schools in the US are extremely expensive yet have terrible outcomes (especially for the poorest, who cannot move neighborhoods to get their kids into a better school).
  - Some countries (Germany is one IIRC) *ban* homeschooling. Most others make it extremely hard, by putting many legal and bureaucratic hurdles in front of would-be homeschoolers.
  - The US has mostly banned unpaid internships (which used to be the best way for journalism students to get experience).
  - In Italy, the government gives so many benefits to students that many of them stay in university well into their thirties, and the university "overbooks" its lectures (signs 80 students up for a 30 student classroom), knowing most of them don't actually plan to attend.
  - US student loan program has led to massive tuition inflation. [Some of these loans are shown to mostly benefit the already well off](
    &gt; The New America Foundation, no right-wing nut-bag critic of generous welfare policies, exposed that Georgetown was using this program to pick up the entire law school tab for its students—not just some portion that they couldn’t payback. This is how it works: The program forgives loans after 10 years for law graduates making less than $75,000 in government or non-profit jobs. Until then, however, they have to pay 10 percent of their income toward the loan.
    &gt; So Georgetown calculates what 10 percent of $75,000 or so would add up to over 10 years. It hikes students’ tuition by that amount because that’s what they’d ultimately have to repay. The students finance their entire tuition—hike and all—from Uncle Sam. Georgetown uses the hike to pay off the feds and the students get to pocket the rest.

- I assume I don't have to harp about the evils of the Drug War/bans on prostitution, etc. There are many more subtle ones like bans on organ sales, minimum wage laws (arguably fits here, since no economist expects it will actually help the economy). All of these are pure deadweight loss: we harm people in the name of doing the right thing.
- The government almost never does the right thing (as defined by mainstream economists) when correcting externalities. When addressing acid rain back in the 70's, instead of simply putting limits on sulfur emissions/taxing them (the classic Pigouvian approach), they mandated a specific technique (exhaust scrubbers IIRC) be put in place. Why? Because otherwise, the coal power plants would have simply switched to burning low-sulfur coal (which was a little bit more expensive, but way cheaper than the filter approach) instead and that would have led to reduced demand for West Virginia coal (whose senator made sure it wouldn't happen).
How well do modern governments do at their "core functions"?:
- Our defense policy is a combination of jobs program, corporate welfare, and bombing the shit out of random countries all the time. It probably would defend us properly if we were invaded, but it also does a ton of harm that it really doesn't need to.
- Our police is mostly an enforcement arm for prosecuting victimless crimes:
  - [They have no legal obligation to protect citizens](
  - [They have become an increasingly militarized force]( All of Radley Balko's stuff is worth reading BTW.
  - [Police and prosecutors are mostly immune from prosecution, even in the most eggregious cases](
- Our laws have become vague and broad, and leave incredible discretionary power to prosecutors:
  - [Most Americans are unwitting felons]( Very few actually get prosecuted, but the ability for truly horrible stuff to happen to them is there.
  - The vast majority of the law is no longer introduced and voted on in Congress, but rather is deployed by specialized regulators who have very few restraints on their power. The predictability of law is entirely gone.
- Civil contracts (especially) are less and less respected over time. When GM got bailed out/restructured, the arrangement gave some groups more (and others less) than they were entitled to under bankruptcy law.
Faced with this complete failure of government to achieve its stated aim there are many "stages" one goes through:
- Denial
- Belief that the problem consists of the particular people in office, and that replacing them with more honest, competent and wise people will fix the problem.
- [Realization that the structure of government causes the issue]( Belief that structural changes through the existing political process will fix things.
- [Realization that majority-rule and other core components of the decision making process lead to problems]( Belief that introducing [new competitors in the market]( will fix the issue. Cypherpunks (and libertarian bitcoiners) also sort of fall in this category, except they want to "carve out" pieces of the world and make them government-immune. I'm at this stage.
- Complete despair? If you can't beat them, join them? IDK.

They do come at the cost of initial setup with that merchant. My example above works with any merchant (as long as I have BTC). Also that magic comes at the cost of that merchant permanently having your payment credentials (and all the bad things that leads to).

Right, it seems we're talking past each other here.
I completely agree with Mike Hearn's assessment that miners *should* run a bitcoin-core node and use it to check what they're mining on (and use GBT, so that they also verify the contents of the merkle tree). In an ideal world that would be your oracle (the RPC interface would make it trivial to use), and there's almost no coding needed. Wonderful, but not what most miners are doing.
I'm kind of starting with the position that the reason this hasn't happened yet (and P2Pool is still tiny) is precisely because it requires extra work to setup (and some extra resources to dedicate to it). So what's the least intrusive solution (from an end user perspective)? No configuration, no secondary machine, no extra software.
As ugly as it sounds, plugging in an SPV client (not a wallet, just something that can independently track the state of the network) is a pretty good fix, measured by that criteria.
The interface the miner cares about is basically "here's the parent I'm mining on top of, please tell me what is wrong with it", and the response is either "tip of chain", "old block", or "unknown block".

Unfortunately, to make a currency stable when it's small (like Bitcoin is) requires backing it with something more established. That requires a counterparty to honor the redeemability of the currency.
When companies tried doing this (e-gold), they were shut down with extreme prejudice by their local governments. Bitcoin sidesteps that particular issue by not being redeemable for anything, but that means price discovery is extremely hard to achieve until and unless it becomes widely used.

Generally the way you define such a thing is basically that the exchange of money doesn't affect the legality of the underlying behaviour/cannot be used as an excuse to further restrict such behaviour.
It has near-zero support from the population at large, of course, and it's much much too late for an amendment (which would be as toothless as the 4th, anyway), but it's definitely not a new idea. [It used to be somewhat taken as a given by the supreme court, once](

Dead man's switch is a little bit tricky to do right, but here's a general idea:
- Give an empty paper wallet to the eventual recipient. They need to keep it safe.
- Choose an approximate time for the dead man's switch to trigger.
- Your wallet generates a transaction sending all the funds to the paper wallet, with [NLockTime]( set to that time in the future (this is approximate, due to mining speed variance).
- You can safely send that transaction to the recipient in plaintext, or store it with a third party. There's nothing secret about it, all you care about is making sure it's available for the recipient to retrieve in the future.
- If the delay has passed, the recipient can [push]( the transaction onto the network. This will move the funds to their address.
- Spending any funds yourself will invalidate that transaction, so as long as you send any bitcoins (even just to yourself), and make a new deadman's switch transfer transaction (with a new NLockTime) you can keep pushing the redemption date into the future.
In theory, your wallet could take care of that automatically. This is a pretty cool feature.

Even if you start with the premise that a deflationary currency is bad for the economy, it is bad precisely because people are incentivized to acquire and keep it. Inflation might debatably be better for the economy, but it does not make a better money.

The new invalid-but-longest chain would have to be made available to the miners somehow (and a large number of them). In order for that to happen, an attacker would need to make large numbers of nodes available for miners to connect to (since honest full nodes don't forward invalid blocks). It's not impossible, but it seems like it would be pretty tricky to pull off, and have not much payout (since the only effect is to DOS some percentage of miners for 1 block, at the cost of mining 1 block + the setup required).


As someone who runs a full node and has never mined, I completely agree. I also agree with your assessment of simplicity, not resource usage, being the main factor in GBT's relative unpopularity. This solution is lightweight enough that I think it could be bundled in all mining software (unlike bitcoin-core) and be enabled by default. That's where it wins on the simplicity front and would be an improvement.
IIRC, GHash.io doesn't support GBT at all. That's also one of the problems I'm trying to address.

Transaction malleability means that txids are not reliable identifiers. Multiple codebases are using them in different ways.
- MtGox was using them to track withdrawal payments. They had funds stolen because of that.
- Some exchanges were using bitcoin-qt to sanity check their balances. Bitcoin-qt has a bug that will make it over-report balances when multiple variants come in. Those exchanges shut down as a precaution, because otherwise bugs in their internal accounting wouldn't be detected.
- Most wallets assumed they could take an unconfirmed change output (that they created) and use that immediately in another transaction. Turns out that's not reliable. Heavy wallet usage will therefore result in failed transactions (because someone is using it to do a DOS).

That is not exactly true. The only changes that require only a majority of the hashpower on board are those that are stricter than the current ones (soft-forks). Most of the really bad stuff (extra coins, spontaneous seizing of funds, and the like) requires everyone to upgrade to the new code.
So really the only thing a regulator could do with 51% of the hashpower obeying him is either:
- Kill Bitcoin as a medium of transaction (by double spending).
- Freeze accounts by refusing to include their transactions.

Instead of speculating about what will or won't be done, here's the main types of changes, and how hard they are to pull off.
Policy changes:
This is things like what messages nodes will relay, fee levels, "standard" transactions, and the like. Because there is no need for consensus, nodes can and do have different rules. Devs can easily change the rules for their specific codebases.
This is when the rules for what constitutes a valid transaction or a valid block are made more strict. For example, if there was a change to impose a minumum size on blocks to stop discus fish from making tiny ones. All you need is for 51% of the mining power to switch over.
This is a change in the rules that is less strict that the existing rules. For example, increasing/removing the maximum block size. All nodes need to upgrade. If someone doesn't upgrade they will not consider any new blocks and transactions to be valid.

It's surprisingly hard to actually disentangle payment streams. Most wallets will give you very decent privacy already.
Going forward, some techniques, such as coinjoin, BIP0032, and the payment protocol, will help increase anonymity even further, by reducing address reuse, allowing multiple people to mix their funds right as they spend them, and so forth.
As these privacy enhancing tools become better, and as new ones are created, the amount of information you can glean from exploring the blockchain will converge to zero.

If I own 26% of the hashpower, and I make all my blocks be at the maximum allowed, then eventually I can make the limit grow to infinity.

You misunderstand transaction inclusion rules:
- Miner  Charges $1.25/tx
- Other miners charge $1.00/tx
Let's say 10% of users are in a hurry, and pay $1.25, everyone else pays $1.00. Let's say there's 1000 transactions floating about.
Then 1 of the 4 miners will manage to mine a block:
If it's miner  he made $1.25 * 100 = $125.00
If it's any other miner, they made $1.25 * 100 + $1.00 * 900 = $1025.00
So there's the penalty, which is in fact so huge that some are worried about long term fees spiralling *downwards to zero*.

If the goal is to do damage, you'd double spend against every merchant with the bitcoins you've been mining when ramping up the hardware.
You might be able to bankrupt the merchant processors if you timed it properly, or force them to pass the losses on to their merchants. It could be really damaging to trust (especially if you reverted 24 hours+ worth of confirmations).
In practice there are simpler attacks against the network for someone with a billion dollars, including building a ton of companies whose purpose is to dominate various parts of the ecosystem and then collapse dramatically due to "bugs".
Like MtGox, but with less advance warning and all over the ecosystem. That could really destroy confidence for a few years, opening the window to a competitor system to try and grab marketshare.

- Bitcoin's first mover advantage is pretty small in absolute terms. It would be counterable by paying some of the larger merchant services providers to integrate your new alternative.
- People don't mind big brands standing behind something where they put their money. They get someone to blame when things go to shit.
As to:


The real reason isn't that a centralized money couldn't exist and be successful (it would have efficiency and instantaneity advantages over Bitcoin), but rather that such money has been tried before and either bends over backwards to comply (PayPal), or gets destroyed by the government (e-gold).
Bitcoin will win because all alternative models that could compete with it are de-facto illegal.

Of course there's an upper bound: In the long run, only transaction fees remain. The level of fees is actually a lower bound on the value put on quick confirmation by people engaging in transactions.
You're the first person I've seen to claim there will be too much hashing power instead of too little (most people who worry claim we'll run into a tragedy of the commons situation, where fees spiral downwards to near-zero).

Yes. But all the risk from pooled mining is from the fact it's done in a way where the pools control what goes into the headers.
This doesn't make pooled mining impossible BTW. It just makes it impossible to run a miner that doesn't have a copy of the UTXO in memory.

Fees don't rise to cover costs, costs go up or down until miners just barely break even.


Miners with the most expensive electricity will drop out first. I doubt the difficulty will actually lower: it will just rise more slowly and possibly stop (at least until the halving).


That's very unlikely. Maybe if they still own bitcoins (and many of them do), they might be willing to spend some small amount of time/energy/effort. But you can't count on that.
The steady-state equilibrium hash-rate is what you have to rely on. The good news is that we've got a good margin to protect against attacks.

Mostly because Litecoin's purported advantages are imaginary.
* Faster confirmations: In practice, only the first confirmation really is faster. The value of 4 litecoin confirmations is about the same as that of 1 Bitcoin confirmation (in terms of how hard it is to reverse). Besides, 2.5 minutes vs. 10 minutes is not meaningful, since both are much longer than would be acceptable in retail (and this is an average, it regularly takes 2-5 times as long depending on the network's luck), merchants have to use some form of 0-conf.
* Decentralization: The mining power is decentralized. Bitcoin's problems with centralization are entirely due to people all using the same handful of pools. Litecoin's no more immune to this than Bitcoin is.

No, the alert keys are not important. They're a nice to have, and given the ever dwindling number of bitcoin-qt instances, they're getting more irrelevant by the day. If he abuses it, the worst case scenario is that people using bitcoin-qt will see an alert message of his choice. Big deal.
Gavin is very important, no doubt about that. But he has no real power to slip something in, not with the number of eyeballs watching the repo, not with the reproducible gitian builds we use.

They're virtual units that are designed to account for inflation. In theory if you lend me 1000 UF at zero interest rate for a year, you expect to get back an amount of currency that can buy the same stuff as it did a year prior.
Unfortunately, these units are essentially adjusted by the government, so they only work until the government decides to cheat as a way to reduce their debts. But mortgages often  are denominated in these currencies. So are house prices.

There's two components here:
- A block of people spending immediately "to support overstock's decision". This will dwindle to zero as time passes.
- Some baseline usage of people actully purchasing things on overstock with bitcoin because it makes sense in their situation. This one probably grows (slowly) over time.
The combined effect is: lots of sales in the first few days, slows down to some sustainable level, and slowly increases from there.
If we had more finely grained info (daily BTC sales) we'd be able to cleanly separate the two trends, and make a better estimate. However my approach eventually will converge to the correct number over time, and I don't have better data to work with.

Depends what "area" you're in.
OECD countries:
- The current system for online purchases (credit cards) is fundamentally insecure. This is papered over by liberal application of chargebacks (which are a pure loss for the merchant), but ultimately the costs of easy theft and fraud are borne by all of us in the form of increased prices. Even if Bitcoin never succeeds in meatspace, making online purchases safer would be a plus.
- Beyond fraud, bitcoin payments are really easy once you have some in a wallet. No more typing numbers/addresses and so on. Three clicks and you're done (regardless of whether you've ever bought something with that merchant). It's really frictionless, which (combined with low fees) in turn makes a whole lot of online purchases more reasonable to do.
- Wire transfers are absurdly bad, and bitcoin can replace the high fees and long delays associated with them.
- If you're of the Austrian economics persuasion, bitcoin's fixed supply may be attractive. If you're worried about asset confiscations or capital controls, bitcoin's unbeatable at negating them.
Developing world:
- More people have cellphones than banks accounts.
- Many more are completely shut out of almost all online financial systems. Try making a credit card purchase online from a third-world IP address, without getting blocked by the fraud prevention systems.
- Your local currency is probably really awful too. Bitcoin's already doing ok, potential-loss wise, compared to Argentina/Venezuela (and it generally appreciates over time, too).

IP addresses can be amassed pretty easily by an attacker, and can be spoofed relatively easily.
Registration just moves the problem around: now everyone needs to agree on what the miner list is (in order to achieve consensus). To do that, you need a consensus, somehow. So back to square one.
Basically it's really hard. To solve byzantine generals problem, you need some kind of limited resource that the honest nodes control more of in order to function. PoW and Proof-of-stake are the classic ones. If you could trust a central party to assign voting rights, that can also work.

Following up on that my take on the "central bank takeover" idea looks like this:
- Some government (probably US) promotes their own digital cash.
- Makes it 1-to-1 pinned to their own currency.
- Makes it usable by anyone, no questions asked (this displaces bitcoin from the black market, at least if that promise is trusted to be kept).
- Mandate interoperability with legacy banking system (banks have to allow withdrawal/deposits using this currency the same as regular cash).
- Ban Bitcoin, and imitators.
The idea here is to shrink the set of advantages BTC has by copying most of them, and using a country's own legal market as a captive market that can only use your own currency. This helps build a bigger network effect the better to displace BTC with.
It's what I'd do if I was a central banker. I still don't think it would work.

More seriously, the reason for the statement is that severe economic collapses are often accompanied by large money supply decreases (the 1929 crash being the best example). There are many theories that explain the former as being caused by the latter (which is possibly true), and suggest supply inflation as a quick fix.
What we don't have good evidence of is what happens when you have a mostly stable, maybe slowly shrinking monetary base. Even gold inflated in supply at 1-3% per year. It's part of the bitcoin experiment, so we'll see.

It's possible their custom accounting code would look for failed withdrawals by txid (transactions that simply were dropped from the blockchain), and would re-credit the customer's account. That's a terrible thing to do, but it would result in being able to withdraw repeatedly. And because it's a tumbler it almost certainly was custom-coded up by them.
What I find hard to believe is that they didn't notice until **all** the funds were gone. Why didn't they realize they were withdrawing a lot from cold storage all of a sudden?

Also, OP's linked website has this very self explanatory line:


Rough translation:


As in, this measure is *on top* of the current system, negating most of the benefits you tout so much.
In fact, the swiss proposal is only 1/3 funded by reduction in welfare benefits. The rest comes from marginal tax increases, and about 1/8-1/6 is as yet unfinanced (but they suggest a few libertarian-friendly options to close the hole: carbon tax, [tobin tax]( a tax on luxury products, :P).
So the "disturbing" reaction you're seeing is historically-informed cynicism: "Liberal" now means anything but, the entire world uses keynesian economics as an excuse for deficit spending (even during good times, during which Keynes advised to run surpluses instead), and the Milton-Friedman-esque negative income tax is now something to supplement, rather than replace, our inefficient welfare benefits. Which makes sense: welfare is good (by your moral standards), and the GMI is even better (because it fulfills similar needs more efficiently), but since there's no real objection to organized theft if it helps the poor, [why not both](

In order for 2 institutions to batch payments between each other, they have to have agreements in place (because they're effectively lending to each other).
Blockchain.info's server could just contact coinbase's servers and ask "Do you guys control 3PuEbMgunupShBVTewXjtqbBv5MndwfXhb?". Those servers respond yes/no (possibly with a proof). If they do, both sides can then proceed to pretend the transaction happened (even though it didn't).

Yes, except that:
1. *Only* partners of my web wallet would learn this. (Rather than every person on earth who saw one of my addresses). Even the person paying me wouldn't know (which is important, because otherwise someone who pays me and knows my email address can start trying to target me with fishing attacks and what not).
2. Because the address ends up not being used, coinbase only learns that their user sent money to **some blockchain.info user**. There is no trail after that, because you're spending from the shared wallet, not from your address. That's assuming you're not reusing addresses between multiple payments, which you shouldn't be anyway.


Yes. Flood fill is surprisingly effective (indeed that's how all bitcoin transactions are sent), and you could handle extremely large transaction volumes before this ever became a problem.
If it did become a problem, tons of techniques exist. A service could publish [bloom filters]( that let people check whether an address *might* belong to coinbase. This can help cut traffic levels by a lot.

The blockchain defines the ordering and guarantees the absence of conflicts between transactions.

Just wondering, how difficult would it be to have a BTC buffer held in a wallet you control? If there's a backlog and the buffer runs out, you can't process payments, but anyone buying immediately gets their BTC. That way Bitstamp's slowness only hurts your availability (instead of the PR nightmare that this thing can balloon into).
It seems like you're selling a sizeable amount daily though, so it may just be too much exposure to the exchange rate. Good luck either way.

Disagree because we've already moved past the point where anyone can reasonably try to corner the market in mining hardware.

Yes. That seems eminently reasonable to me.
Namecoin is an interesting experiment, an attempt to use the same tech for different purposes.
Ripple is a different tech trying to solve some of the same problems as Bitcoin.
Both, regardless of their eventual successes, have technical merit that the clones don't.

The payment protocol (BIP0070), while designed mostly for online purchases, can help with this. Part of the payment is to submit the signed transaction directly to the given url, so that it can give you a receipt. Then only the merchant has to worry about how well connected their node is (and can ensure it gets sent widely).
@_date: 2014-01-20 07:47:27
1: Given the length of time that things sit in pull-requests, it's not just the devs or miners that have an opportunity to object, but pretty much anyone who's paying attention. There's yet to be a change that was pushed in over reasonable objections.
The only thing I can think of that was even remotely close was the minimum output size on relaying, and even then the objection consisted of a few trolls on bitcointalk.
2: Many people have written alternative implementations, including full validation mode on bitcoinj. They're not discouraged, except for the fact that they **rightly** advise miners not to run in (because of fork risk) and correctly inform people of the risk they'll be split from consensus (as in: you probably don't want to run this if you're a merchant).
It's a nasty problem to resolve, but it's not something they caused (and if I remember correctly, Luke-Jr is working on block acceptance tests to help miners check they're not accidentally splitting implementations off from each other).
As for altcoins we've seen increased cooperation with Litecoin devs (because Warren often has stuff to contribute back and forth between the projects), and Namecoin has been supported for the longest time (since it constitutes a novel use of the same base tools). They've even added features to help mastercoin store information more efficiently into the blockchain. I have yet to believe the "hostility" is nothing more than complete disinterest in the mostly scam-ridden, useless, and developer deficient altcoin space.
3: As someone who's been watching the pull-requests list for a long time, I have trouble believing they did such a thing. [There's a few pull requests relating to openbsd]( and I don't think any of these were handled badly. I've not been able to find any other public discussions on this topic.
4: If you look at the various BIPs that have been made over the years you'll notice that we've had a few close calls where new features would have been introduced that would have been DOA and unusable due to severe bugs that weren't spotted until late of the process (OP_EVAL anybody?). The March 2013 fork is another example of the kind of landmines any change might hit. Core is a good place to be conservative and risk adverse.
You'll also notice that changes that don't potentially jeopardize the network's consensus are included much more liberally (fee estimation logic, full nodes having support for SPV nodes, the payment protocol, headers-first sync).

Unlike what some of the commenters are saying, you wouldn't just need 51% of miners to upgrade, you'd need every full node to upgrade.
The reason is that you'd be changing the rules to be less strict, and every node still running on the old set of rules would notice when you did something that wasn't allowed.
Those nodes would happily ignore the fork, and continue in their parallel universe that still has the 21*10^6 limit.

A mining pool doesn't control the hashpower, but it does control which blocks its miners work on.
Therefore, in the short-term, a 51% mining pool can do the same bad things as someone who has 51% outright. In the long run, the mining pool would have trouble keeping 51% of the hashing power under its control if it tried to do evil things.

Yes, that's the point of course. The idea is to resolve the conundrum posed by these "zeroconf-fraud" pools:
1. You can keep mining on a normal pool for normal profit.
2. You can mine on the "zeroconf-fraud" pool for more profit, *but* you run the risk of undermining the very currency you're being paid in (which hurts your profits).
3. Or you can mine on a "zeroconf-fraud" pool, in a way that never contributes any blocks. This way you get the best of both worlds (You get a cut of all the fraud fees others are creating, but you don't make the network worse off).
3 is stricktly superior to 2, and therefore will be the dominant strategy. If too many people use 3, the "zeroconf-fraud" pool collapses, and everyone has to switch back to 1.


That's less worrying to me because it provides visibility into what frauds are being attempted. This allows merchants to detect the attack, and react accordingly.

It's exactly the same as a 51% attack by multiple cooperating entities (which is already possible).

The fact that mining a block costs $10,000? Basically in the early days of bitcoin, it would have been really easy for someone to make 100MB blocks continuously and discourage people from running full nodes.
At this stage, the ecosystem is mature enough for two things to happen:
- Miners will restrict their own block sizes to deal with orphan risk.
- An attacker trying to make very large blocks will burn through a lot of money very quickly.
There are other possible safeguards, but the core idea is that anti-spam measures belong less in the hands of the core dev team, and more in the hands of miners, who now have proper incentives to keep the cash cow going.

1. Take a bunch of transactions, make sure they're all valid.
2. Add a special transaction to pay the miner.

4. Take this root, combine it with the last block's hash, and a random value called the *nonce*, (and a few other things). This is the *block header*
5. Take the double SHA256 sum of the header. If it's small enough, great, broadcast the whole thing. If not, do step 4 again.

- No central control.
- No way to block payments or freeze accounts.
- ~~Anonymity~~ Pseudonimity.
- Mathematically determined supply.
- No regulatory or legal barriers to entry or use.
You don't have to be a libertarian to appreciate this, but it is very much in line with libertarian beliefs. Certainly, if you don't like the properties above, you probably ought to look elsewhere.

How are BitPay/Coinbase (which you've been recommending elsewhere in this thread) going to keep operating then? You can't have it both ways.


Nodes never relay double spends. It wouldn't matter how many miners *would* want to help you if they never see the transaction. These guys are providing an out-of-band mechanism to connect spenders and miners.
The real consequence is that we're all going to have to make the changes necessary to negate this avenue of attack: We'll write green-address software, build services to prevent double spends, and so on. When the development community is done, we'll be back exactly to where we are now (viable zero-conf transactions), but at the cost of more complicated software and the development hours sunk into it.
BitUndo won't have made much, if any, money. Basically a giant waste of everyone's resources will have gone into keeping things exactly as they are right now, because these guys think they're geniuses and will make a killing.

Bitcoin is money. It would be weird for it to be worth more than all the money currently in the world.
Total money supply estimate I pulled off the web: $68.34 trillion.
Satoshi's cut (assuming we switch tomorrow): $5.4 trillion.
That's about 10 times John D. Rockefeller. And this is clearly an upper bound (Satoshi's cut will be halved by Bitcoin inflation over the next decade, and it's unlikely we'll displace all money).

There's a lot to cover, so I'm going to break up my responses by topic:
**Chargebacks and online fraud**


Every single merchant you interact with online has all the information needed to make any number of transactions withdrawing any amount of money (up to whatever limits are on your card). If any single one of them is dishonest, or just incompetent (and that's widespread), your credit card info is now in some unsavory character's hands and they'll try and ring up as many charges as possible. It's also really hard to pinpoint the source of the leak if they don't self-report (which they rarely do if they're not big).


Chargebacks are often used as a general term for both merchant-initiated refunds and client-initiated chargebacks. These can occur for a variety of reasons.
1. Refunds (where both the merchant and customer want to reverse the transaction) are great, and you can do those trivially in bitcoin-land. Your grocery example pretty much falls into that (and accidentally paying twice in bitcoin is a lot harder due to it's "push" nature).
2. Dispute resolution is sometimes useful for the customer, but it carries a real cost, which isn't always reasonable for the purchase. Most of my purchases are from merchants I trust, and so the ability to do a chargeback against them is not something I need most of the time. With Bitcoin's support for three party escrow, I can have it when it's needed, and not pay for it when it's not needed. If I'm buying a $2 game online, do I really care that I can chargeback? It's not worth my time.
3. A big chunk of chargeback activity is of the form "I bought stuff at merchant X, merchant X got hacked, hacker spent funds at merchant Y". Merchant Y did nothing wrong, but now they're out money and the merchandise (+ chargeback fees, which are usually $20 on top). This is really bad online, because no matter how much info a merchant requests before going and charging the card, he cannot truly know whether fraud happened until 60 days latter.
4. Finally there's a lot of what's called [Friendly Fraud]( You can read up about it, but the basic idea is that card information theft is so prevalent that some people just keep pretending they lost their cards as a way to stiff merchants. Or they pretend the product never arrived and get a chargeback that way.
So the last 2 are things we'd rather avoid, but credit cards make  unavoidable online (and really prevalent wherever Chip-and-PIN isn't used, like the US). And that in turns helps  happen way more than it should. This increases the costs to the merchant (both in losses and fees), and that, ultimately, is borne by the consumer.
If you want to see the consequences of that, look at high-risk merchant accounts, and the insane rates (6-10%) and restrictions those guys are subjected to. Incidentally, a lot of them are jumping on bitcoin.
There's also various business models that are simply impossible right now. I worked on an online ordering system for food. Part of why we shut down was the realization that a single chargeback would wipe out the equivalent of our margin on 100-200 orders. And they're a lot more frequent than that.
In the simplest terms, bitcoin is cash for the internet. And there's a lot of online businesses that would like to be cash-only (or cash-preferred), but never had that option before.

True, except Coinbase/BitPay can't offer that deal if 10% of mining power mines on this service and 10% of purchases use it. That would completely wipe their margin.
Zeroconf was never completely safe, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't try and continue the current track record (which is ~0% successful double-spends against merchants). The more secure zeroconf is in practice, the more useful bitcoin can be in all situations.
Services like these go directly against the broader interests of the community, and a little bit of panic and anger is justified (much like when ghash was nearing 50%) to get efforts focused on tackling the problem (whether that's by orphaning bitundo's blocks, developing green address services, etc.)

How do they know it's a wallet? By making some transformations (indexing into specific offsets of the file), they get a valid private key(s). Same here (except it's hashing the picture).
The only thing protecting OP would be that no one's looking for it, (which is also what protects with the poetry.txt file &amp;mdash; Most wallet stealing trojans are just looking in a few specific places). All the security comes from obscurity, and that's a Bad Thing^(TM).

You're right that there is no solution to Two Generals, [it's even proven not to have one](
If we want to get really pedantic, Bitcoin doesn't solve Byzantine's general in the general case. It only solves it under the simplifying assumption that the attackers are computationally limited (ie. they have less than 51% of hashpower).
This is a reasonable assumption in practice. Other similar schemes exist: for example, if the generals know each others public keys in advance, simple voting will work out.

An Oracle means a trusted third party which can mess up your mining. That's not good.
Now, we could protect ourselves against unreliable/dishonest Oracles by asking a bunch of them. But we'd still be vulnerable to someone running lots of them (sybil attack).
So to protect against a sybil attack, let's just ask for the block header and check that its id makes sense (ie: lots of leading zeroes). However, the sybil attacker can still return old blocks to fool that test.
So let's keep track of the blocks different oracles are claiming, and actually get the headers for each, and check the parents, and so on and so forth, so that no group of oracles can fool us.
And that's what an SPV client does!


Absolutely. However, the concern is that no miner will bother. Therefore our safest bet is to include it by default. It can/should be a separate library with a well defined interface (for reuse), but to successfully be used it needs to run as part of the software.

Really tricky to give any real confirmation in 1 second, regardless of how you do it (you're starting to run into speed-of-light issues).

That's an oversimplification. Pools have to avoid participating into double spends if they want to retain hashpower. To them the small profit from pulling off double spends isn't worth the risk of their miners abandoning them. That's what keeps zero-confs secure *for now*, and it has worked pretty well so far (combined with the fact that no relay nodes will help them do it, so they need alternate means of obtaining the information).
In the long run, if a good chunk of the hashing power does start behaving in the "maximize fees, don't block double spends" way, there are a few mechanisms that can help merchants protect themselves:
1) A merchant can react to an attempted double spend by simply taking all the money they received and spending it away as fees. Then a rational miner will prefer to mine the original transaction *together with* the "burn as fees" transaction. And the attacker can't outbid that.
The net effect is that neither the merchant nor the attacker have the funds. This countermeasure sucks for the merchant, (because they lost the money just as effectively as if they had been doublespent against), but it does destroy any incentive to attempt that kind of double spend (since the attacker did not get to make any money from the attack). And deploying this doesn't incentivize dishonest pools more than the rest.
2) Some techniques are being proposed to allow [extremely low block times without orphaning]( These require a hard fork, of course.
3) If nothing else works, it's possible to build systems using multisig that make it impossible to double spend the funds ([using a variant of green addresses]( by involving a third party the merchant trusts as a cosigner. They're clunky and complicated, so no one's going to build them unless they're actually needed.
And of course the usual disclaimer applies: Most online purchases are not instantaneously finalized, or are reversible. As such transactions can be accepted instantly even if none of the above techniques end up working.

@_date: 2014-06-08 23:18:37
Yes, in theory.
That won't protect you from a 51% attack, because you'd expect 1 pool to switch away from the main network and mine a branch of all their own blocks to orphan the honest branch.
In fact, if you're worried about GHash orphaning you, you should wait until *they* mine a block on top of whichever one includes your transaction (because they'd have to do double the work to undo it).

This is the biggest threat to bitcoin: a centrally controlled, fiat pegged, digital currency (with zero fees).
It can be as cheap as bitcoin, by maintaining irreversibility and pseudonymousness.
But it keeps the power of issuance with the central bank.
The reason I don't think it's likely is because:
1. It would require the central bank to embrace technology that kills off a bunch of its member banks.
2. It requires the government to agree pseudonymous payments are ok, law-enforcement wise.
3. It risks legitimizing bitcoin even more.

If you listen to the talk, he mentions he wants to start paying suppliers in BTC, if they'll take it.
While suppliers are paid using methods that have lower fees that credit cards, their biggest pain has to do with the delays the funds can take to clear.
So overstock's plan:
1. Accept BTC, cash out immediately.
2. Get some suppliers to accept BTC (they'll cash out immediately).
3. Stop cashing out all the BTC, instead use it to pay suppliers.
If this works, long term we'll see a closed economic loop. It may take years. We'll just have to wait and see.

2. If you're keeping any bitcoins, learn how to properly secure your wallet.
3. If you're cashing out, have a plan. Maybe you can work with merchant service companies (BitPay &amp; al). Maybe you'll need to transfer yourself on an exchange. If it's the second, learn how much you can sell safely without slippage (I suspect you could liquidate the lot within a week on BitStamp). Make sure you're comfortable with the risks of holding onto bitcoins for that long.
Good luck. This is tricky to do right.

You're making a very strong assumption: That people will visibly revolt on taxes.
It's *way* more likely they'll just start underreporting (which is already a thing). Small businesses' net incomes will stagnate or slowly decrease (while the real growth gets siphonned and hidden away).
People will claim they're unemployed while working on the black market for BTC (as long as they can do it online).
More ambitiously, anonymous online businesses will spring up, who don't have ties back to human identities at all. These businesses will be able to operate much more cheaply.
No revolt. No slogans. No visible opposition. Just the legal market slowly shrinking away.
To me, that's the much more likely outcome.

One of the factors for people keeping lots of BTC in exchanges is that they feel more insulated against a sudden price fall.

Here's the long form.
A block has 2 parts:
- A set of transactions.
- A block header.
The first transaction in a block is called the coinbase transaction. It basically follows special validation rules: instead of only being able to spend money from existing transactions, it can create money out of thin air. The maximum is (inflation subsidy + sum of the fees of all the other transactions). If it's more than that, the block is invalid.
You put a bunch of transactions together, and you combine them into what is called a Merkle tree. This tree has a hash (called the root), which represents the entire set of included transactions.
You put the merkle root into a block ([which contains other fields as well]( Then you start hashing:
1. Take the SHA-256 sum of the block header.
2. Take the SHA-256 sum of the result.
3. If it's lower than the target, publish it.
4. Otherwise, increment the **nonce** field and try again.
This can be repeated as many times as necessary to find a valid block.

Someone who's finding blocks could be holding zero bitcoins (if they're constantly cashing out). Conversely, satoshi likely doesn't mine, so he's making 0 bitcoins from transaction fees, despite his giant holdings.
So no, just having bitcoins does not give you a cut of later adopters' bitcoins (which is the defining feature of a pyramid scheme).
More importantly the reason there are transaction fees is because the task of making a block (running a full node, verifying transactions, finding the nonce) takes processing power, and that's not free. So transactions fees are compensation for that expense.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:08:12
Well, peercoin is a hybrid IIRC.
Proof of stake has one big known problem, and that is that because there is nearly no cost involved in signing a particular chain, rational actors would sign both sides of a fork (to maximise the likelyhood of being paid). This in turn would make forks be resolved less quickly.

Usually, if a transaction is included in an orphan, it also was included in the sibling block of that orphan (simply because most miners have the same transaction selection policies).

I'm going to be extremely pedantic here, but it's not true. While a miner cannot give themselves a bigger subsidy than they're entitled to, it is valid to give themselves less. This has happened a few times (&lt;100 BTC in total IIRC) due to bugs or people messing with the mining process (back when it was trivial).

I think the problem with 2) is a DAO can't guarantee it has bitcoins to pay with.

Traditional visa and mastercard processing is just escrow. They don't call it that, but in effect it's the same.
The bitcoin-world equivalent is what is called 3-party escrow. Instead of just giving you 10mBTC, I send it to a multisignature address that needs 2 keys to move funds and has 3:
- One is mine (the customer's).
- One is yours (the merchant's).
- One belongs to a third party arbitration service.
- If I receive the goods and I'm happy, we move the money together to your merchant address.
- If I don't receive the goods and the arbitrator agrees that you didn't send the merchandise, he and I move the funds back to my control.
- If I refuse to move the funds to you, and the arbitrator agrees that I'm being an asshole, then he and you move the funds to your merchant address.
Since the 1st outcome is the most common, and it require zero work from the arbitrator, this promises to be a lot cheaper than systems where the arbitrator has to be trusted with handling the money.

It doesn't replace credit. But credit cards are part credit instrument, part payment mechanism. There's no reason the two functions have to be merged in a bitcoin world. In fact, if you need a bitcoin loan, there's ~~btcjam~~ (apparently a scam) and competitors trying to fill that niche.

Fundamentally, all brainwallet attacks are brute force/dictionary attacks. If your scheme started being used even a little bit, it would be subject to the same treatment. In that situation the only thing that matters for security is:
- Entropy of user input.
- Time taken by attacker to make one guess.
Nothing you do with hmac + BIP32 is actually increasing your security (because given a secret phrase and pin, there's exactly 1 way to derive keys). Your scheme is roughly equivalent to SHA256(bip32seed + "|" + pin) in terms of how many guesses will be needed, and each guess takes barely longer. So no, this doesn't make it more secure than simple concatenation.
Some things that *do* increase security:
1. Use something that is user-specific but trivial to remember in the deriviation. passphrase + FirstName + LastName adds quite a bit of entropy without making it harder to memorize.
2. Use a slow deriviation function. Scrypt with higher than default parameters will be very helpful, because it forces the attacker to take more time for each guess. Take a look at [BIP38]( which is a password encryption standard for paper wallets, for ideas.
3. Using [sentinel wallets]( which are a subpart of the full passphrase, can serve as an early warning system.
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:58:42
You've got it a bit backwards. *Transaction fees* pay for the security. But, in order to bootstrap the currency (when no one is paying fees), and in order to initially distribute the funds, there is an *inflation subsidy*, which is currently 25 BTC/block (halving every 4 years).
Of course, right now the subsidy is 100x the fees, but that's not expected to last.

1. I already have an amazon 3 years heavy-usage reserved micro instance with AWS to host my websites. It doesn't have enough RAM to run a full bitcoin node.
2. I need a cheap way to make offsite backups of my parents' NAS. I already have a 2TB harddrive containing a copy, now all I need is a small machine to run rsync every day. Cloud hosting a copy of the data in a way that allows rsync (I can't do full copies, their upload is too slow) costs way too much.
3. From a decentralization/resilience perspective, hosting a full node on a third-party's hardware doesn't do as much to protect against failures (whether accidental or deliberate).
    If AWS goes down for a day or someone finds a vulnerability to hijack the VMs (as unlikely as that is) then *all* nodes on that service are no longer contributing at best (at worst, they're actively used in a sybil attack against SPV clients). Hosting your own hardware (or using small/obscure hosting providers) helps increase resilience of the bitcoin network against these kinds of risks.

They can't use bitpay, because they generally don't even have a corporate bank account at all (too much risk for the banks).
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:42:22
Ok, let me try explaining the attack on transactions, and why it's not applicable to blocks:
I make two transactions: One pays me, one pays you. I broadcast the one paying you. All nodes see it and timestamp it (t1). You wait a minute, assume it's safe, send me stuff. Yay.
*But*, I happen to run a shit ton  of nodes. On my signal they start pretending that the transaction paying me was there all along (with a timestamp t2 &lt; t1).
Shortly afterwards, Bob connects to the network after a brief absence. He hasn't seen either transaction yet. Who should he believe? From his perspective, either one is equally valid. He knows someone is lying, but who?
The reason that's not a problem with blocks is that faking history is expensive and hard. I can't just tell my nodes to start parroting an alternate history, without first creating one (which requires more hashpower than everyone else combined).

Bitcoin is very libertarian, but only on a very *narrow* topic.
Certainly people who think the government should be able to freeze, reverse, track and tax transactions at will should probably look elsewhere.

What can we do to help MtGox? Send every new person planning to buy/sell bitcoin there and make them think keeping funds there is sane.
Of course that is evil, since they'll probably never see their money again. So you see the dilemma.


If MtGox doesn't stop operations after this, all it means is that they'll collapse again next time, with even more people's money in it.
The optimal scenario is of course that MtGox is solvent, but that their reputation is so bad as to keep all new users away. But we don't control the first part, only the second.

First, we start at possession: the act of having exclusive control over an object. This is a property of the real world, independent of moral systems, and you have to accomodate it. I guess it's possible to reject the morality of such a thing, and assert that it must be stamped out, but I've never seen anyone take that position consistently.
Possession works ok, most of the time. In Bitcoin, it is in fact all you need. For the clothes on your back, or your bicycle locked against a post, it probably does an OK job. When you're person A living in a slum, and you want to go work, it doesn't work as well, since walking out of your shack means person B might take it (real documented examples of this abound, sadly).
Now, we may disagree whether such a taking is an immoral act or not, but we can't deny that the person A doesn't want it to happen (which is why he stays in/near the shack at all times, or has a close relative controlling it when he's gone). If he does take a chance, and person B does try to take over, we're bound to see conflict.
From here you can take 2 routes to property: Either as a social construct to minimize such conflict (by making sure person B doesn't even want to take a risk, knowing his entire social group wil punish him for it), or treat the conflict (A's potentially violent retaliation), as the starting point for a theory of property (that is, treat A's actions as motivated by a concept of ownership that extends beyond what he directly can control), and introduce a social consensus as a mechanism to avoid the all too common situations where multiple people believe themselves to be the rightful owner of some thing.
Either path leads to a similar conclusion: Property is just how we avoid the negative-sum behaviour that arises under simple possession:
- Defensive behaviour (not leaving the vincinity of your house to avoid losing it).
- Rent-seeking behaviour (convincing your fellow tribesmen that you deserve Bob's house, because you're better looking/more popular/whatever).
- Feuds over property (Ideally there's arbitration, but *anything* that puts some final say on who has ownership, even if unjustly, solves the issue).
It isn't predicated on morality, but on efficiency. It's taking the underlying reality (possession) and formalizing it into an arrangement that's less volatile and violent (but just as arbitrary).
That's the basic reasoning. Combine that with the empirical evidence comparing regimes with weak property rights vs. strong ones (especially vis-a-vis the state), and you see the efficiency gains in action.
Now, that's still a very vague concept, so I'll describe some of the properties it should ideally have:
- It needs to be predictable: In order for economic actors to make good decisions, they should have access to as much knowledge of the future as possible. This doesn't rule out insecure property arrangements, but it does require that the loss be known in advance (taxes on land are better than random confiscations at someone else's whim, slowly changing laws are better than regulatory uncertainty, etc.).
- It needs to be unambiguous: Two different interpretations of who owns what become a source of conflict. Traditionally, this is done by making ownership public knowledge, to try and stamp out the possibility of honest disagreement.
- It needs to be transferable, as cheaply as possible: Low transaction costs help Coasian bargaining bring about more optimal allocations of resources, which is desirable overall.
- It needs to be separable: Ideally, if I own something, I should be able to separately transfer any well defined right relating to that thing, while retaining the others. For example, I can own land, and yet sell the right to collect its rainfall to someone else (or the minerals underneath it, or whatever else I want to transfer). Again, this helps economic efficiency.

When receiving, yes. The mistake was that "all" wallets assumed their own change outputs were safe to use immediately. [That is now being turned off in bitcoin-qt (maybe by default)](


[see update](
Specifically, it turns out [balances were not computed properly]( Not a huge deal, but enough to make anyone relying on correct balance calculations (like Bitstamp) shut down because they use bitcoin-qt as a sanity check on their internal accounting.




Things have been really confusing so here's my best explanation of the timeline:
- Malleability has been around for a long time. It wasn't handled super-gracefully by the reference wallet (dead transactions would stick around, for example), but it didn't matter much since of how rare it was (and you could just delete metadata and rescan to fix your transactions + balance).
- MtGox was vulnerable to repeated withdrawals in the presence of mutability. This would lead its wallet to get really confused as well.
- Either accidentally or deliberately, someone exploited this loophole in MtGox. They stole funds (maybe), and also put MtGox's wallet into a non-functional state.
- MtGox halts withdrawals, investigates.
- MtGox blames malleability, insinuates everyone is affected.
- Foundation &amp; others say only MtGox is affected
- Someone (or many people) try to see if they can steal funds from other exchanges by exploiting malleability. They start modifying tons of transactions.
- This causes problems with other wallet systems (mostly bitcoin-qt). These problems don't result in funds theft, but they cause enough trouble (with balance calculations and fast sends) to cause Bitstamp/BTC-e to shut down for a short time.
- These problems are actively fixed on the github repo.
- Exchanges run with these patches applied, go back online.
- MtGox is in deeper shit, resolution still pending.

If you wanted to do that, the best plan isn't so much to flood (although that works nicely), but rather to *listen*. If there's an attempt at a double-spend, you can usually know it within seconds, and refuse the payment. [Cool research has been done on this topic](
I believe BitPay/Coinbase do this, and Mycelium has a "confidence" indicator that also uses this.
That stops anything short of a "Finney attack", where someone builds a block with the double spend in it before paying you. But that attack is so expensive (because of orphan risk) that it isn't worth doing for less that a couple thousand dollars.

Depends why it happened.
If they just close, but didn't lose too many coins, I suspect the effect will be negligible.
If it turns out they're short 30% or more on coins (because of txid-hacks), then the effect on other exchanges' prices could be to push them up (because effectively the supply is smaller than we thought it was). Or it could lower prices more if people lose confidence in the overall BTC economy.

Just to make sure, you're talking about money &lt;=&gt; currency conflation, right?
Because all 4 bullet points I have **were** examples of money, that is:
- People used weights of precious metals as units of account, used metal specie as tools of trade, and some amassed vast vaults fill with them.
- People definitely stuffed used paper money denominations as a unit of account (rather than falling back to gold weights), and would save paper money (entrusting the vault to store the metal it represented for them).
- Shell money was used as a unit of account: "every adult male being required to pay annually 1000 shells for himself, 1000 for every pack-ox, and 2000 for every slave in his possession". A similar currency, the Yap stone coins, were passed down from generation to generation, playing the role of store of value.
- [In this article about mackerel as money]( there's a few quotes exemplifying it fulfilling all roles of money:
    &gt; "A haircut is two macks," he says, as an expected tip for inmates who work in the prison barber shop.
    and
    &gt; As a result, says Mr. Levine, prisoners approaching their release must either barter or give away their stockpiles.

The short answer is no.
The long answer is:
When you pay with a Visa card, there is only ever one company that can process your transaction (Visa). It is therefore capable of extracting significant transaction fees, because your alternative is for both merchant and customer to use a different service entirely (Master Card).
With bitcoin, there is only one network, and any miner is free to include your transaction into a block. This means that if one large miner decides he won't mine your transaction because it pays too little, that doesn't stop any of the others from including it.
In fact, transaction fee markets are extremely competitive, to the point that you can expect miners to make almost no profit ever.
The only way that they can try to extract monopoly rents, is by &gt;51% of hashing power banding together to exclude blocks from competitors. However, if that happens, then they can also do lots more of bad things. Transaction fees will be the least of our worries.

I'm pretty sure you've got that backwards:


More importantly, the incremental cost of adding one more transaction to a block is infinitesimal. The two things stopping the cost from falling that low are:
* We have hardcoded min-fees on relaying. The devs are working on removing all traces of hardcoded constants for fees from the code.
* The transaction increases the block size, which increases the propagation latency, which increases the chances that it will be orphaned. Since even an empty block is worth 25BTC, the transaction must pay enough in fees to offset this risk. This will go down as the inflation subsidy decreases. Once the block reward is negligible, this effect will not be nearly as noticeable.

The reason the poor don't flood to our countries is that we erect arbitrary and violently enforced limits on their freedom of movement. This isn't a hypothetical, it's the grim reality we've built in order to "protect" our nascent welfare states at the start of the 20^th century.
In the US, this has led to a permanently off-the-books class of residents that aren't here "legally". In Europe, similar problems exist.
Milton Friedman was of the opinion that open borders and a welfare state were mostly incompatible: 
I don't oppose GMI as a replacement to the current system: it's just a better administered form of the welfare state. What I won't let you do is take the moral upper ground, and say your proposal is about helping the poor. It is rather about helping one group of poor people at the expense of other, even poorer, people (and incidentally the rest of us).

He forgot the biggest reason it made sense to use PKI for BIPS0070: It's what websites already use.
If PKI is compromised, then we've lost long before there even is a BIPS0070 request, as the attacker can take over the website itself (and serve an unsigned request or just a direct address to divert payment). Using PKI means we don't add new paths of attack on top of what already exists.
Now, for person-to-person payments, maybe something like PGP makes more sense. Thankfully, BIPS0070 allows for swapping out the signature scheme, so if you feel strongly about this, get coding.

Let's assume that these solutions are developed and are built to be Bitcoin backed (as opposed to Ripple, SWIFT or other settlement system), and that using them doesn't prove to be a big hurdle for people which want to use Bitcoin.
What happens next?
- Off-chain transaction systems happen, and are cheaper than bitcoin proper (because bitcoin is kept deliberately expensive).
- Interoperability between providers is optional and requires trust relationships between them (to some extent).
- The dominant players have an incentive to disable interoperability with their smaller competitors.
- As they grow big enough, they also have an incentive to fill blocks with high-fee transactions to stop competitors from interoperating *with each other*. And the blocks are pretty easily filled.
- Any competitive environment is not stable: given two off-chain service companies, there's an efficiency gain from merging them into one entity with one ledger (and no need for settlements over the ever more expensive bitcoin network).
- The endgame is one big off-chain provider and no competition.
- The off-chain provider is big and trusted (because people have no choice), so when they stop redeemability, the world keeps using them (see Nixon and the gold window).

I was just pointing out that doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results isn't going to help you. In fact it makes things worse (since each campaign is dividing your attention and people's donations, making all of them more likely to fail).
Here's some of the things you're doing wrong, that you should go and fix first:
First, it seems your broad goal is to help people donate to charity more easily. The approach you've chosen is automatic spending. Some problems with that:
1. All it does is reduce friction for making repeated payments, which isn't a big hurdle in the bitcoin world (click, done). It moves all the friction up front, to setting repeated payments up.
2. Making micro-outputs is an inefficient way to pay. Much better to make one large payment.
3. Most charities use a payment processor to convert to fiat. Those guys don't generally provide a reusable static address.
Second problem is that you're asking for a lot of money, and there's a giant wall of text standing as an explanation. Most people will not find the information they need to make a decision. There are guides to raising funds on crowdfunding platforms that may be worth reading first.
My advice?
- Don't raise funds for development efforts. The general reaction will always be "Why ask for money when you can do it in your free time?".
- Don't integrate into wallets, because they'll rightly see it as feature bloat.
Instead I'd build something much simpler for bitcoin-accepting charities: a simple tool to re-email previous donators on a recurring basis, with a donation link right in there.
Then you don't need complicated wallet integrations or user participation to make it happen. Just talk to a few charities that have started getting bitcoin donations (and are keeping email addresses) and offer to build it for them. Start small.

You're making it too complicated. The trick is to not make it into a big decision (if you're telling them they should buy some to invest, that's a large mental hurdle).
Get them a phone wallet, give them 3 bucks (of your own funds). Get them to go buy a video game or something cheap like that. Help them if they need it.
At that point, usually, the lightbulb goes off. And you can explain how things worked behind the scenes. Or explain as they do it. Contrasting the payment system with credit cards (and explaining how/why it's safer) helps a lot.
If you don't want to give away money, just send them $5 bucks, and have them send it back to you. But buying something makes it more real.
Just don't try to get people to risk money upfront. That's usually a sign of a scam, and that's probably why they worry so much. Give them a chance to use &amp; understand it without risking anything.

Almost certain that you mean block reward.
As to your question:
The plan is, and always was, to increase transaction volumes over time. This allows for increased per-block total reward for miners, without causing anyone else to pay extra.
The cost of securing transactions on the bitcoin network (mining) is 0.01% validation, 99.99% hashing right now. This means that a 10x increase in users (and in transactions per block), will not increases the total mining cost by any significant measure. So cost per transaction (including inflation subsidy) will drop to $3, then $0.3, then $0.03 as we increase total usage.

It's technically very easy. The problem is that you just need 1 miner to break the embargo (and none of the others be willing to orphan the block) in order to move the funds anyway.
And if you do have such a group (51% of miners agreeing to block certain transactions and blocks that include them) it's not very different from being under the control of an attacker (the attacker claims to be doing this for everyone's good, but almost any attacker would claim that).

That's called arbitrage, and while it's possible, I don't recommend trying it if you don't know what you're doing.

@_date: 2014-01-28 22:58:42
I'm genuinely curious.
The whole point of the inflation subsidy was to get larger hashrates early on in bitcoin's history (enough to ward off attackers), and to introduce currency into circulation. I'd argue that it did that job pretty well in 2009-2012. Now the hashrate is probably into excessive territory, but hindsight is 20/20.
So unless your broader point is that all of this is a giant waste of time, money and effort, I'd like you to spell out what's so wrong with the current state of things.

Without knowing what you're selling, it's somewhat hard to tell what the risks really are.
General tips if you're doing it yourself.

Simplest method? Your clearnet servers are just proxies for the real site, which you run over Tor. This is reasonably easy to setup, and losing the ISP doesn't hurt you as much.
DNS is fundamentally controllable, so you can't expect to save your domain names.
The SSL connection can be tunnelled right to the Tor servers, so that someone seizing the boxes can't even recover the SSL private key.
That way seizing the ISP hosted box causes no more loss than seizing the domain name would. That's the best you could do.

Balances are an abstraction. No blockchain code even has a notion of a balance.
All that really exists are transaction outputs.
Let's say I have a nice block of 50BTC I mined myself. I want to pay you 5BTC. What actually happens is that I make a transaction that turns my 50BTC output from mining into both a 5BTC going to you, and a 45BTC output going to me as change.
When you want to spend the money you just received, you will build your transaction by referring to the output. The reference consists of the *transaction identifier* and the position of the output within the transaction.
If the transaction identifier gets modified, your attempt to spend its output is then invalid.

Bitcoins are easy to move, Fiat is not. It is extremely slow to move USD back from MtGox. During that time there's a good chance that:
* The bank providing wiring services to MtGox will cut them off.
* The bitcoin prices will rise so that you'd have made more money just holding 50k of bitcoins.
The exchanges are working on getting more bank partnerships to increase the ease of moving fiat. You'll know they've succeeded when the price difference goes away.

No! This is more complicated than 51% of hashpower.
There's three levels of changes:
- Policy changes: These are changes in the client's rules that are arbitrary: What transactions to relay, what to include in blocks, how big to make blocks (as long as it's below the 1MB limit). These can happen without the need for consensus. The lowering of minimum fees for relaying falls under that category.
- Soft forks: These are changes that require 51% of hashing power to start enforcing them. Generally any change to the consensus rule to make things more strict falls in this category: For example, if we wanted to force a minimum block size, that would be a soft fork.
- Hard fork: These are changes to the consensus code to make the rules more permissive. Every full node needs to upgrade in order to see the changes. Increasing inflation, making block sizes bigger than 1MB, changing sha256 to something else. If you decide not to upgrade, your node will never accept these new blocks (and you live on your own parallel chain).
@_date: 2014-02-10 01:07:34
Oh, if 51% want to conspire to do double spends, they can. But doing so would destroy the value of the money they'd manage to steal. Also it means losing a bunch of blocks in the attack, so even if they're willing to take the risk of destroying the currency, they would have to be willing to lose lots of block rewards + transaction fees, so it wouldn't be worth it except for extremely valuable items.

@_date: 2014-02-07 01:17:32


No. Please don't spread misinformation on this topic.
- Nodes always keep and relay only the **1^st** transaction they see that spends specific outputs. The second attempt at spending the same money will not be relayed.
- Because of that, if you wait more than [a few seconds]( the entire network has already seen the original transaction, and will ignore your attempts to double spend. You basically need to send both transactions at the same time.
- If the transaction that pays the merchant doesn't reach their node, they won't even see that you tried to pay them. So you have to make sure one transaction gets to the merchant, and a different one gets to all the miners
- This means that unless you stake out the merchant and figure out their payment node's IP address, trying to double spend will very likely either actually pay the merchant, or not trick the merchant into thinking they were paid.
- For added difficulty, merchant services like BitPay/Coinbase run many nodes (not publicly disclosed) all over the network. If you broadcast two different transactions, their nodes will notice.

100% of modifications that don't remove the sha256d proof of work can be done as soft-forks.
- Require old blocks to just contain a coinbase transaction paying zero, and an OP_RETURN or similar.
- That value is the hash of an entirely different structure encoding the new protocol, whatever it is.
- To old nodes it just seems like the miners are being idiots, mining empty blocks and not even paying themselves with the block reward.
But this is ugly and I don't understand the advantage of a soft-fork if old nodes are 100% incapable of validating blocks.

Attack how? If you're building on top of an invalid block, you can't fool any full node. BitPay/Coinbase/Blockchain.info are all immune to whatever shenanigans you're trying to pull off. The best you can do is trick someone with an SPV node that's connected to an attacker's full node into accepting a set of confirmations for a transaction. Which is already a risk, regardless of exact hashpower ratios. I know there's been talk about fraud proofs as a mechanism to alert SPV clients that a block is invalid which is also a potential improvement.


Arguably, although the point is that mining centralization through pooling is bad *because* of the risk of a pool doing something dishonest. We wouldn't freak out if P2Pool had 80% hash rate.

Let me give you some cases when the reasoning breaks down:
- There is only a limited amount of block space for transactions: Then it becomes very much like an auction system, where only the *n* most expensive transactions get through.
- There is a cost to including transactions: right now, each transaction you add to the block increases the risk that it will be orphaned (because bigger blocks propagate slower), which means that accepting really low-fee transactions is a bad idea.

In competitive markets, merchant costs lowering by 2% leads to lower prices for consumers by the same amount in the long run. The first guy who switches can pocket the difference, but that only lasts until most of his competitors do so as well, and someone decide to compete on price again.
There's also the possibility of making fees be paid by the merchant either implicity or explicity (because they care about fast confirmation the most).
Child-pays-for-parent is a pending patch to miner logic that lets low/no fee transactions into a block if the output transaction is respent in a higher fee transaction. This would let users spend the funds without any fee (at the expense of making the merchant pay the fees for 2 transactions)
One proposed addition to the payment protocol is the ability for the merchant to say: "Pay this much fees, but take those out of what you're paying me". This wouldn't hide the fee, but it would look free from the customer's perspective.

Well, I don't think it would win, but it would have the following advantages:
- Value pegged to the US dollar (that's really easy to do if they control the supply).
- Zero transaction fees (because they make money from printing/creating it).
- The government could make it legal tender (or go further and mandate merchant/bank acceptance). So it's a cryptocoin that you can spend anywhere.
- If they own your root private key, and tie it to your personal identity, you can recover lost keys by showing up to the USPS with your ID. If they get stolen, you can trivially report the theft, and they'll know who the funds were moved to.
None of these appeal to me, but I could see some people preferring that (especially if they trust the government).

Well no, there's a few steps between.
- Nodes run alternate code.
- Miners mine blocks with alternate code that sets a flag.
- Supermajority of blocks is achieved.
- Grace period begins.
- Grace period ends. &gt; 1MB blocks are now valid.
- Someone ~~finds~~ creates a &gt;1MB block.

@_date: 2015-08-20 15:30:53
The patch we're talking about does a few things
1. There is a rule that says "when you're running out of connections, choose a peer with low priority to disconnect first".
2. Right now the only priority rule is "Connections from Tor exit nodes have less priority than connections from other IP addresses".
3. The set of tor exit nodes is public. There's a script that fetches them and populates a hardcoded list that's compiled into the software.
4. Since the list generated by 3 gets out of date pretty fast, nodes will also fetch a fresh list from the tor project on boot.
That's it.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:11:11


That can only be done but only by doing a ton of hashing. Here's a  validation algorithm with annotated run times:
1. Download header. O(1)
2. Check difficulty is what it's supposed to be. O(1)
3. Check hash of the header matches the difficulty of the header. O(1)
4. Download contents of block. O(n)
5. Check contents of block and make sure it matches the header. O(n)
In order to get the validation algorithm to get to step 4, you'll need to do the full proof of work that could instead be used to mine a regular block.

@_date: 2015-08-31 01:58:30
Sure, let me quote the source:


IE: he's using the geometric distribution.
Now, he's reusing his original "0.000259803036528949" probability (from the binomial distribution), truncating it, and plugging that into a geometric distribution CDF, yielding the following numbers:
* 1 - (1 - 0.0002) ** 5000 = 0.6321573498386028
* 1 - (1 - 0.0002) ** 10000 = 0.8646917847222401
And so on, which exactly matches his graph in section 2. So hopefully this is a clear demonstration of how he generated his numbers (which, since it matches what he's saying, isn't crazy speculation on my part).
So, as I was saying, this is a basic ~~math~~ probability error. A geometric distribution assumes independent trials (coin flips, dice rolls, etc). However a run of 5000 blocks does not constitute 5000 independent trials: If I get 700 blocks in one trial, the very next trial can only be 699,700 or 701 blocks. So obviously his use of a geometric distribution is completely wrong.
Now [someone else]( claims to have run the numbers by simulation and it's from their figures that I got the 15x overestimation of fork risk. Credit goes to them as I'm just repeating (and checking) their own explanation.

Adjustment takes time. Specifically 2016 blocks, which at full speed takes 2 weeks.

He's got a basic math error, when treating overlapping sub-sequences as independent events. If two sequences have 999 block overlap, they are extremely strongly correlated. This results in a 15x overestimation of the risk of early trigger at 70% (and it gets worse for lower proportions).

Any change that requires all clients to update can't unilaterally be pushed by miners. Let them try. There are 2 possible outcomes:
1. They don't get enough people on board to trigger the fork (based on whatever criteria they set). Nothing happens.
2. They fork off from the main network and do their own thing. The original branch continues working (because the fork's blocks are considered invalid by full nodes), albeit with lower hash rate (difficulty adjusts pretty fast though). We all have coins on both sides of the branch and can spend them independently.
Both of these don't hurt end users much.
The obvious next step in the argument is then to say that it's not just miners switching, but a whole lot of users, merchant services, and exchanges going along with it.
But all those exchanges, users and merchant services could also decide to use doge tomorrow, stop operating in the crypto space entirely, or just close their doors. We don't own them, and they can do whatever they want.
The real question is, why are all these people itching to jump ship in your hypothetical?
@_date: 2015-08-31 21:55:39
The NotXT risk remains substantially the same.
The expected time for early activation with 70% of hashpower goes from 3 months to 5 years. I'd argue that's a big difference in practical terms.
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:40:44
Yes, but there isn't a fix to remove the 32MB network limit in any codebase yet (not even BIP101/XT). So people have to upgrade twice: Once before the hard fork, and once before the network limit gets hit.
For BIP101, that's in 4 years, so no big deal. With BIP100, that could be reached in 1 year possibly, depending on how fast the increases happen.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:03:47
1&amp;2) Kinda. You can prove that you're the first person to have embedded a hash of the finished product into the blockchain. However, this doesn't mean that you're the first one to create it (you may have taken someone else's work and embedded it before they got around to it).
3) No.

@_date: 2015-08-25 03:36:13
No, it's a quirk of the network protocol.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:21:06


Not quite. A majority of hashpower can go and do its own thing right away if it wants to without getting orphaned. Whether you see their branch is dependent on what code **you're** running. Nobody else matters. In the hypothetical case that shall not be named, you can just keep running a 1MB hard-limit full node, and it will never make the switch.
The reverse applies, I can fork of consensus right now if I edit my code to put a hard block size limit to 500kB, or end all inflation subsidies, switches to sha3 and resets the difficulty, or do anything else that makes the current consensus invalid. If some miners join me, we can just build our own little alternate universe.


The tricky part with SPV clients is they check very little, and trust the majority of hashpower to define/enforce the rules.
However, it's actually pretty straightforward for SPV to request a size proof from the full node. There's just no code to do that yet.
It's impossible for SPV to validate that a block respects payout rules, short of downloading the whole thing. Some proposals to fix that exist, but require hard forks.
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:37:57
That's an interesting one. We're reaching the limits of my understanding of the implementation code.
It seems you could do that without issues, forcing the download of a full block. The first step is merkle tree checking, because that's cheaper than signature and logic checking, at which point the client would consider the block sent to be invalid, raising the banscore of the sender.
If you had multiple neighbor nodes under your control, I guess you could do this for a while, forcing the receivers to do some CPU work, but more importantly, forcing them to download every such mangled block. However, you're in a race with honest peers broadcasting the real block. Once the node downloads a block that works, it'll ignore any other offers of the same block.
So if you don't control the block's broadcasting (because it isn't yours), you won't be able to do a ton of damage (especially since miners have direct connections to each other, usually).
If you do, delaying the broadcast of the valid (non-scrambled) block means you're essentially delaying broadcasting your own solution, much like selfish-mining, which incurs a very real risk of orphaning. Moreover, the nodes you're tying up in validation are not actually receiving your real block anyway, so delaying them doesn't do any extra damage vs. just withholding your solution. You could try to broadcast the legit block to some part of the miners, and the mangled block to others, but again, that's going to only work until the legit block gets relayed  over (and that's a matter of seconds).
I'll have to look at the code to make 100% sure my reasoning is correct.
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:48:43


Your article has some misconceptions, but this is the biggest one. It is in fact really a stupid idea to try and make bad blocks to DOS other miners. Here's why:
- ~~Blocks are announced to peers in the *inv* message. The identifying info for the block is its hash.~~
- ~~It is trivial, by looking at the hash, to validate that sufficient PoW was done on it.~~
- ~~Therefore a block with invalid PoW never needs to be downloaded, it can be rejected just based on its id.~~
- ~~Making an invalid block is just as expensive (hashpower-wise) as making a valid one. You could make your competitors do just as much validation work by just mining normally.~~
There are risks in large blocks but DOS with large invalid blocks is not one of them.
EDIT: I see that I didn't address half the argument, so let me restate:
A block can be invalid in one of 3 ways:
1. The id is wrong for the difficulty.
2. The id isn't the hash of the block header.
3. Anything else.
For the attacker, blocks that fail 1 or 2 are very cheap to make, but something that passes them and fails 3 is just as expensive as making a real block.
For the validating node, rejecting 1 is trivial, rejecting 2 is almost-as-trivial (requires downloading a 40-byte header and hashing it), and rejecting 3 can take a while.
But making a fake block with valid header and PoW is just as expensive a making a real block. There is then a huge opportunity cost to spending hashing power on making such blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:49:06

My statement is limited to saying that the "fixes" you suggest only fix mining pools, which are the least harmful form of mining centralization (because you can switch pools pretty easily).

Let's assume the world population *squares* in 20 years. That is, every human out of a population of 7.122 Billion has 7.122 Billion kids (So 14 Billion kids per couple on average).

In this bleak distopian future there are ~2^65 humans, probably stuck in a world covering, writhing mass of bodies. There's about 2^160 possible bitcoin addresses in the system as it exists today. So we still have 2^95 addresses per person on average.

I think you're overthinking it.
The reason that people don't accept counterfeit money is because the self-enforcing social agreement is that people don't accept counterfeit money. If you were to accept it, the you wouldn't be able to spend it, so it's worthless to you.
If you want to understand what the rules are, just look at how merchants validate your payment.
Gold: Check that it's made of Au 197 up to some specified purity %.
Paper fiat money: Check the various anti-counterfeiting measures, to verify that these were indeed printed by the federal reserve and no one else.
Credit Card: Ensure that master card/visa/amex says that the payment went through.
Bitcoin: Verify the transaction chain and blocks all the way back to genesis.
As you can see, there's no clear cut rule that's universally accepted accross all possible monies. All that matters is that people have reasonable confidence that they don't end up with something they can't turn around and use. And you'll notice that almost no rules beyond that bare minimum will be communally enforced, especially not any notion of history (Nazi gold being a clear example of that).
In fact, fungibility is considered a core property of good money. Bitcoin is the odd man out, in that it requires you to jump through hoops to dissociate currency units from their history.

Simply put, the blocksize limit was only put in there as a DOS-limiter. It was never intended to stick around once legitimate transaction volume picked up to more than 7 transactions per second.
In the extreme case we can see two outcomes (Exaggerated for effect).
Really low block size limit compared to transaction volume: most transaction volume is priced out of the blockchain. Anyone can mine, but no one can actually spend their coins directly on the blockchain. Bitcoin becomes ACH 2.0, all normal people end up using inputs.io, and other off-chain systems. Funds become easier to freeze (because you don't actually control them).
Unlimited blocks: Running a full node becomes really expensive, so much so that almost everyone switches to SPV. Some small number of miners actually run (&lt;100), but they have dedicated datacenters for that task. Anyone can spend bitcoins, but the risk of a miner's cartel breaking the rules increases. The mining infrastructure becomes easier to shutdown by hostile governments.
Pick your poison (you can mix, too).
The good news is that if technology advances keep pace with Bitcoin network growth, we won't have to choose, we get both unlimited on-chain transactions for cheap (cheaper than now even), while anyone is able to be a full node.

To some extent, they'd be in trouble:
- They won't be able to spend or validate payments while the internet's down.
- There are workarounds to this if you trust the people you're receiving money from (making paper wallets as a payment mechanism), but there's zero protection against  double spends then.
- Their money will be waiting for them if they leave the country with their keys, or the internet get turned back on.

Ok, some terminology first (with the representations for each):
Private key: a secret random number that is needed to control the funds (5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF)
Public key: corresponds to the private key, can be used to encrypt messages to the recipient (in hex yours is 04588d202afcc1ee4ab5254c7847ec25b9a135bbda0f2bc69ee1a714749fd77dc9f88ff2a00d7e752d44cbe16e1ebcf0890b76ec7c78886109dee76ccfc8445424)
Address: RIPEMD hash of SHA256 hash of public key. Always the same length (1CC3X2gu58d6wXUWMffpuzN9JAfTUWu4Kj). This is what people send money to.
Wallet: A set of private keys (deterministically generated, key pool, etc).
A compressed public key is half the size, so in your case it's 02588d202afcc1ee4ab5254c7847ec25b9a135bbda0f2bc69ee1a714749fd77dc9, which hashes to 19GuvDvMMUZ8vq84wT79fvnvhMd5MnfTkR.
In theory it means people can pay you in two different ways. In practice, they would need to know the public key, which only is revealed as part of spending a payment, and it would be weird to pay to an address that isn't publicized anywhere.
[Some extra info](
[Test things out here, but don't use this as a real wallet, because it's easy to mess up](
Let me know if that's clearer.

See it from my perspective: I know nothing about BnB as an organization. This means that in order to support this combined publicity stunt/charity move, I have to read more about this, and figure out whether supporting them is a net positive, (if it isn't then this is just charity, NTTAWWT). I've been on the website, and I'm still not sure what they're about at all (beyond what you can glean from the name).
Besides, the logo is not going to be very distinctive from 2+ meters away, and that hurts the publicity prospects. I'll send them a suggested revision for the design.

To some extent yes? I'm not sure chargebacks are that big of a benefit. They're essential in the credit card world because of how much damage could otherwise be done with stolen numbers. Bitcoin's philosophy is to make theft hard (ideally hardware wallets will make it unthinkably difficult), so that we don't make merchants pay for the awful security model of modern days.
There are plenty of customer protection laws in place that would still apply, it just wouldn't be as easy to get funds back.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:45:12
Well, apart from chargebacks (in which you rightly don't want to get involved), what protections do your cards have? PIN? Can I call you to get the card disabled? Can I replace it, or does a loss result in losing the coins as well?

Start small.
1. Get $10-$100 max. Buy it locally or through coinbase, to avoid waiting for days.
2. Figure out how to get it onto a wallet of your choice. I'd recommend electrum/multibit/blockchain.info.
3. Spend it on something.
4. Repeat until you feel comfortable. Then you can decide where to go next.

One of the solutions proposed is to make fees be explicitly part of the transaction. What this would protect against is people using createrawtransaction and friends and accidentally paying 20BTC in fees.
It requires a hard fork, and it doesn't protect people from bad software (which might do the calculation without warning the user).
It's a pain to fix this in any way other than telling user to use good software, unfortunately.

There's a huge distinction between the NSA developing capabilities to use in its operations, and them actually using such capabilities against the vast majority of internet users, who have done nothing wrong.
To top it all off, they've also been working on undermining crypto standards and commercial implementations. That's downright evil, because it harms the innocent just as much as the guilty.

It's not.
The idea is that bitcoin is safe to use, as long as you have at least one honest node.
So as long as jgarzik and his team are honest, this little broadcast satellite can protect against sybil attacks for anyone who listens to its broadcast.
If they try to do evil, then you're no worse off than if the satellite didn't exist.

You could calculate the age distribution of unspent transaction outputs (utxo). This would give you an idea of how much money is actively being pushed on the network.
Doesn't necessarily mean much given that people can send themselves money, and off-chain transfers do happen (coinbase -&gt; coinbase wouldn't show up).

The big one to worry about is that blockchain's service gets hacked. 
Thankfully their wallets are encrypted, but there's a risk that vulnerabilities would get put in the javascript code to leak your keys when you try to spend it.

Because it's got nothing to do with bitcoin per se, and the people caught are already bitcoiners who understand what "Caveat Emptor" means.
The problem with CryptoLocker is it creates a bunch of people who are first introduced to bitcoin in the context of getting their data ransomed.

If hte payment protocol ends up being adopted for in-person payment as well as online, that would solve the problem, since the spender actually sends the transaction to the receiver directly.

Words cannot describe the level of stupid in that quote. "Our hyper-simple model doesn't agree with observations so we assume that we're not observing things properly."

It is really weird to see the infighting isn't it? People have been talking about various kinds of blacklisting for years (with the consensus that it's probably a bad idea). No one got angry about it.
Now that a few clowns with political connections are trying to push the concept people are taking aim at:
- The bitcoin foundation (because Peter Vessenes once thought tainting could be a good idea)
- Mike Hearn (for mentionning tainting in the context of one problem it could solve)
- Every US merchant (for operating in a country which might impose such a system on them)
Can we focus our efforts on those people who actually want to fuck things up?

Maybe, but one of the best ways to stop that scenario from happening is to create a large class of merchants that just love the lower fees and no chargebacks from accepting bitcoin for payment.
Basically if BitPay gets to PayPal size or larger quickly enough, no regulator will shut them down. They might still slap some KYC/AML rules on them, but nothing that seriously harms the convenience/cheapness of the service.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:20:46
Again, let's not panic.
Yes, there's a group that is trying to push tying real identities to addresses.
Yes, they will almost certainly try to get the US Gov to support this endeavor.
Yes, this is going to be very damaging to bitcoin commerce in the US, and to the privacy of people purchasing with bitcoin in the US.
US merchants will not voluntarily support such a scheme, because it hurts their ability to get paid.
The bigger lobbying groups (Bitcoin Foundation, DATA) will almost certainly oppose this effort, because of the harm it causes to their members (which are mostly us-based merchants).
I've seen quite a lot of angry recriminations aimed at the innocent right now (someone is blaming Mike hearn in another thread). This is hilarious, given that we've got a clearly defined set of bad guys, which should be the ones blamed for pushing this.
