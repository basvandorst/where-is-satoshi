The seller was really happy and says to the Channel that she hopes more and more people start using this method of payment to buy and sell properties in the country. The flat was sold for 40 btc and it was sold almost instantly right after it was listed!

And how the hell u gonna use that? People in cuba DONT need a store of value right mow! PEOPLE in cuba need to SPEND, and nor btc or btrash or dash or whatever is suitable for the country now cuz we DONT have 24x7 access to internet + majority of the people are ignorant about it
@_date: 2018-09-30 17:17:07
Going back to Bitcoin! YOU ARE WRONG like totally WRONG, u are an arrogant human being who doesn’t pay attention and talk to much bullshit.  I had some comfort in Cuba, yes i give you that, but internet 24x7 wasnt possible even for someone like me, SO, HOW THE HELL IN THIS WORLD ARE OTHER PEOPLE GONNA USE BITCOIN IN CUBA? 
There is not (yet) infrastucture to give 24x7 internet to Cubans. Its is too expensive and i repeat only very few people use the SUPER EXPENSIVE AND SLOW INTERNET we have atm for important things... like no one cares about Internet in Cuba, there are bigger internal issues to deal with, everyone has their own fight. No time or money to use instagram, facebook or reddit like you! 
So again, go back to your initial message and read all the stupidity you wrote about using bitcoin and spend bitcoin in cuba! You are wrong! That is simply not possible, you are very stupid when it comes to 3rd world countries it seems.
So go back to your room and keep HODLING your dick while looking at btc graph.
@_date: 2018-09-08 16:07:59
That number for the price in 2020 seems pretty accurate as well for me
@_date: 2018-09-29 12:53:57
I couldn’t agree more... the thing in Cuba is actually ‘the internet’+ ‘the screwed up social-economical situation’. Before we can adopt bitcoin we must understand what is living in system open and organized at the same time cuz no body really knows there what that means.
Not many Cubans have the luck of traveling and knowing other places in the world so the majority of us are kind of blinded by our own truth which is far from what the world is offering. 
In Cuba no body cares/know what store of value means, like people only wears gold cuz it shines not for its properties or value. Banks dont work, no body controls where your money comes or go to.Im not saying that kind of control is a good thing, but we don’t know what is a ‘normal society’ . To give u small example many many many millennials have smart phones which is either stolen in cuba or stolen in some other country. People know that but they have to BUY it regardless cuz bug companies are BAN in Cuba so that kind of technology hardly reaches the country.
I messed up a bit, sorry if all that doesn’t make much sense.

Im not assuming anything, Im Cuban and i know how people think.
You can buy gold in Cuba for a third of its actual price, not even gonna talk when someone is desperate... 
Thing is in Cuba there are not certified places that buy/sell gold, the gov doesnt care much about and the very few people who actually buy it  they’ll do it for a very cheap price with solely purpose of wear it.
No one has a bullion of gold stored at home.

Cuban here mate! I have tried that with several friends and they all seem pretty interested about bitcoin however no body apart from those living in Miami seem to be getting on board, in the end they all raise the same question: How the hell am i gonna use bitcoin if we don’t have internet in Cuba?
On the other hand, monetary situation is bit particular, its not like in Venezuela or Argentina where inflation is breaking thru the roof. In cuba we have our own fuked up currency which never goes up or down ( cuz the government says so)  so prices of goods don’t fluctuate that much, there was a time in the 80s where u could buy all kind of things with almost nothing but back then we used the dollar and the country was supported buy the Russians, but after the 90s when we dropped the dollar mainly pushed by the USA we then went thru a critical social and exonomical crisis, we implemented our own shitcoin ( call the chavito or cuc ) in a desperate measure to save the economy, however we messed up even more at the point that today our country is fully OUT of the world’s economical system. Our currency have no value whatsoever abroad and no country exchanges it, you only find it in Cuba and if you want it u have to get it only there. Its more or less like a scammy ICO who got sold 100% and the company is dictating everything you do or the value the currency has since they ‘the gov’ decides its value like if theres no market to decide for it, like a BIG BROTHER UP THERE.
We dont even have credit cards or bank accounts! Its impossible to trace the thing we do cuz we ALWAYS use cash, and you could argue thats a good thing but its not since money laundering is a thing there and you dont even know your are onto it LOL.
What im really trying to say is that we have bigger political, social, economical issues to fix before getting into bitcoin. A Cuban society fully backed by bitcoin (that would be my dream) isnt possible right now cuz of the things i stated before furthermore 85+% of Cubans are total ignorants about whats happening within the internet apart from some millenials using facebook or instagram, just in the last couple of years the internet is becoming a thing for us....
Despite all that, I will keep working on raising awareness i got your back pal!

“Nostrum” bro, but they usually go for precooked meals like pasta, lasagna and some vegetarian meats -if they exist lol-, they also have salads and tons of sandwiches.

SEPA is fast yes but as you said interbank transfers take their time to issue the deposits/transfers. Whenever my family wants to send me money or vice-versa if we are not customers of the same bank it's a fkin nightmare. But don't go too far whenever I make a SEPA transfer to my exchange it will also take a couple of days. The fastest I've got my money is the following day ( which i dont complain about it ) but they usually take their time and most of the time is not because of the exchange but the bank itself.

That’s not the point... at current prices even if you divided bitcoin by 100000000000000000000000000000000... if you pay 1000$ to every American citizen  every month in bitcoon we would be running out of it realllllllllllll soon! Simple math mate.

Do u even understand the point of the post? In some hypothetic situation when UBI is paid/converted into Bitcoin, after 1 month we would have not enough bitcoin to pay all Americans in case they all hedl to it and didnt sell, so price would skyrocket! Thats the whole point ffs! Its stupid to talk here about units, that’s not even the point, LOL with 1000$ you buy today the same amount of msat, sats, mbtc, btc in dollars term! Take 2 seconds and go thru the main idea of the post before spitting words this lightly ffs, and btw wth u bringing lightning to the conversation? Even if you add 1000000000000000 units you still going to get the same amount of btc in terms of $.

I agree that’s smart move -SHORT TERM-... but in the end if he puts all his effort in making bitcoin the one and only he will end up having those massive returns only in bitcoin. My point is that if you just switch the market cap of all those shitcoins + some more develpment/acceptance of btc the gainz should be MASSIVE in the near future, so why keep procrastinating those coins that are eventually going to be dead? Why keep focusing on short term gainz? 
All these people focusing on shitcoins 99% are doing it to profit from ignorat investors cuz no actual development is shown! All those developer -some of them really good- could be working on bitcoin and maybe we could have been a step closer to take the scam fiat down!

Top Lad but unfortunately that’s a dinner feast for trolls :( , he’s already getting some kindergarten question. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 06:36:01
Exactly thats a big issue for us, cuz once u make it out of the country as a tourist no bank will open an account for you (at least in Europe u need certain kind of documents in order to open a bank account) .
But that would be the least of the problems i’d say, the easiest thing for a Cuban to receive bitcoin right now would be thru a friend or fam. Like he goes online in one of the spots around the city (which is stupidly expensive for the country but prices are decreasing) download a wallet( ovbiously using a good vpn service since apple and google play are blocked or dont work there) or create a paper wallet(anyways he wont be able to spend those btc) and then start receiving from friends as i said before.
Having a bank account yourself would be an issue unless you travel often, cuz you wouldnt be in total control pf that account, that would be like frozen money. Yes, you can withdraw in Cuba -not deposit tho- but the fees are stupidly high.
So my recommendation if you are cuban would be, get a paper wallet, and find someone you trust who can deposit btc for him constantly or so anyways as i said he wont be able to spend anytime soon... but you know Hodl is a thing within us. That would be a nice store a value for cubans, since everyone is keeping our fuked up currency under the mattress and it has mo value whatsoever.

Yeh im Cuban mate i perfectly understand Spanish :) . I also know the fusyona service but i wouldnt recommend it tbh, as far as im concerned its pretty shaddy and the guys running the business are usually pumping other shitcoins (at least on the facebook group). 
I see something pretty similar to Venezuela in Cuba with a nastier situation since at least their ccy has some worldwide recognition, ours dont even have that priviledge so i guess things will get weird once we “adapt” to the widely accepted financial system. 
I defo see a rise of Bitcoin within the cuban population thus it will get easier to adquire it and exchange it perr-to-peer without trusting a 3rd party

Ik i can pick those tickets for 10$, regarding the live conf people pay 200$ not only to have a chance to meet them in real person but also to travel, this time you gonna be seated in front of your computer praying to god almighty the connection and organization is good enough to see their faces correctly. 
Going back to conferences, those stupid prices is one of the main reasons why no body assists and those who actually do are always the same people. They could have easily set the prices of the whole packet cheaper or even for free even more now that theres so much interest about lightning! This is a crucial point to keep on boarding people.
Its like Tone’s conference: Understanding Bitcoin,  for people to learn about bitcoin and lightning, yeh sure thing norms are gonna pay 400€ for what they hear everyday is a ponzi scheme, people are greedy as fuk in this environment and moved by money, they dont give a shit about noobs, hypocrisy at its finest. :)
 
And btw : none of those topics are new, you can find info on github and their respective channels about it. Dont try to cover the sun with 1 finger.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:48:10
It is called commited fees and it is veryyyy helpful once some channels are not actively cooperating and one of the parties need/must force-close it and settle it on-chain hence it varies UP/DOWN according to what i just told you but not only cuz of it.. other than that... Use a custodial wallet.

If this whole argument is because i said he does not support shitcoins... Well he does shill bcashsv, but my poijnt was related to support/shill icoed shitcoins/tokens and i repeat to you, name one he has supported and i will name at least 5 roger did for each one you name.

All this info is public so i still dont get what exactly you understand about the tech... 
Regarding lightning you defo don’t run any node, otherwise you wouldn’t be trashtalking about the technology while praising bcash. ‘We dont know if lightning works’ ?? I do know it works cuz i use it everyday...

Hey bcasher... are you gonna name a single icoed shitcoin or a token promoted by fakesatoshi or u just gonna keep evading my question? I already told you that i made a lil mistake in the post but i dont hear you defending your boss Roger the rat, i dont hear you naming why fakesatoshi is worse than roger... 
In my opinion Roger is a cancer, arrogant prick, a deceiver and a shitcoin shiller... Since you dont push me back on this one i will have to assume that you agree with me, also what u think of those statement of your top bcash shiller Roger about he abandoned the ship any moment for a shitcoin? You have a statement on that or... bcasher.
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:31:46
You are a bcasher, and the solely purpose of why you came here to argue and comment is because you got butthurt for what i was saying about your shitcoin and that ratface who runs it. My point stands and you have not named a single ico or shitcoin icoed promoted by fakesatoshi, again... i will name 5 of those conducted by roger for each one you name. Bye.

I know people that were (and still do get) tricked by those equal symbols when buying one costing over 10 time less the other on bitcoin . Com. Roger should held accountable for all those who got scammed via that website.
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:18:06
Who stated otherwise?
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:08:34
No one here is competing for math its all aboout not trusting anyone! I’d rather trust the ECB than Bitmain. Since i dint trust any of them.. i run my own node and validate my own transactions. Its all about it.

Hey mate how u doing with the delisting? I see you taking your nasty life soon
@_date: 2019-04-13 12:42:11
Did u read the post?
1- where did i state bcashsv is any better than bcashabc? They are the same shit.
2- ofc fraud is fraud... who doesnt get it? 
3- whot?
Roger is not funny... Roger is the worst actor (ofc this doesnt make cws any better tho)
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:52:46
I use it every day ... pretty usable in my opinion, use it on my cellphone connected to my node for instant payments with almost 0 fees while the main and robust 1rst layer is getting spammed. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:43:56
Ofc bsv is a shitcoin... it was fairly launched just like bcash, but they are both pure trash.
Now that we agree on that part, name ONE, ICO or ICOed shitcoin/token he ever shilled? As i told you, im gonna be naming at least 3 Roger ‘the rat’ has shilled in the past... not to mention all the times he has said he wouldn’t hesitate to switch to a shitcoin if bcash doesnt work as he expects. 
For me Roger and bcash are pure shit and if sometjing is going to be delisted and called a fraud we should start there. 
So again... im waiting for you to name 1 ico or icoed shitcoin/token promoted by fakesatoshi.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:30:14
Hey roger seems like you need to take your head off of your ass and keep up with this space... 
But i didnt hear you naming ico or token shitcoins fakesatoshi promoted, oh no ! Maybe you are too imbecile to know that or simply you dont have that info :( cuz it doesnt exist.
I can point you in the right direction for all the crap Roger the rat has spoken in the past about anything from his ignorance, and that includes the perma shills on shitcoins (but u already know this LOL)
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:01:13
250k sats are 100€? Are we already in 2045? 
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:40:28
Dude... you must understand for a newbie or someone that has never ever heard about crypto when you see Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash both with the same symbol, one directly linked to buy by the site and one over 10 times more expensive you must understand that the first thing anyone would do is buying bcash. Arguing on this is atupid... i wont change your mind, the victims are out there, and for what it seems they will keep coming but hopefully they all dump that shit after they learn a bit in the end bcash is pretty irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-04-13 14:43:46
If anything they successfully split the Bcash community... im grateful for that!
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:02:12
Whinnimg over 10k sats yeh :)
@_date: 2019-04-13 17:36:06
Btw is any of you Bitcoiners still dont believe most of what we have in 2017 was spam attack here is the proof. We are almost at all time high amount of tx and fees are pretty low with the bitcoin mempool clearing quite beautiful.
Not even gonna talk about how fast development goes in lightning.
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:01:59
No, i understand perfectly that i made a mistake (that i can not fix) after i posted it. 
Other than that Roger ‘the rat’ Ver is a fking well known scammer worse than CWS since he shills all kind of shitcoins and icos. The real cancer is that bitch, if something must be delisted, we should start with bcash... 
But i have a question for you... Have u ever heard or seen fakesatoshi shilling a token or ico? Roger the rat does it all the time cuz thats what he is A FRAUD! In case u wanna name one cws shilled im waiting bcasher.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:58:08
And i applaud you that... but whining over 5 cents wont help much, i and many others already explained the reason of those fees varying, it will go down when the mempool clears out a bit.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:56:04

@_date: 2019-04-13 18:10:45
Exactly.. let the market decides :) im here just to remind bitcoiners (not you) that if they relenteslly going to ask for a delisting of bsv (like they are currently doing on twitter) they should do it more effusively with bcash... Many would agree (not you cuz u are a bcasher :)
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:28:23
I fortunately didn’t get tricked as well... but some friends did for a substantial amount of money (believe me or not thats your take)  and you can call them imbeciles, uneducated all you want but that’s the reality in the crypto sphere, Roger and his scammy company aren’t helping to clear that out and in case you want more info, the internet (twitter, app store, google store, medium) is full with those claims.
@_date: 2019-04-01 22:15:20
110$ is a bit too expensive imho... some of them are just gonna repeat what they constantly say on twitter but in front of a video camera this time, this conference should be cheaper so we can on board more avg user.

@_date: 2019-04-13 18:01:19
This is a friendly reminder now that people are attacking fakesatoshi and claiming everywhere to exchanges to delist bcashsv... i just wanted to remind them all that bcashabc is real horseshit and it ahould be delisted first! This was the whole point of the post. I dint have to remind anyone how useless bcash is.. that is already proven.
@_date: 2019-04-01 23:07:02
Hey im just gonna stop  right here cuz i don’t want you to think im against this conference or wanna sabotage this post somehow. 
I couldn’t agree more with your points and im gonna be the first tunned in asking questions and supporting... But unfortunately my noobie friend wont.

@_date: 2019-04-13 17:13:02
Decentralized alternative? Did u know that...
- Almost all bcash nodes come from a single VPS provider in China.
- The majority of hashrate is tied to a single person.
- The consensus... if they happen to have any, is dictated by 1 developer who happened to be employed by Jihan and Roger.
Since you bcashers dont know what ‘dont trust, verify’ means... i invite you to check all that info on their github, its all public.

Which one, name ONE shitcoin he promoted that has ever conducted an ico or a token... NAME ONE.
You have to understand that im not in any way defending him, he’s a fraud a disgrace! But truth is what i said, he never promoted an ICO, roger ver and bcash on the lther hand is a dirty rat!

@_date: 2018-11-03 11:12:57
I know how bat works, same as any other shitty erc-20 scam token... 
I know the creator of bat was not only the creator of firefox but also and way more important he was involved with JavaScript at the very beggining. 
Nonetheless he didn’t need to launch a fking scam token or an ico in order to do all the things bat does. They are a friking company offering a simple service. I struggle with the fact that he in order to make more money from stupid investors and riding the ico scammy wave launched that shit when this would have worked better as a normal company. There’s simply no reason for the existence of this token, this is pure NOISE in the ecosystem.
Im not saying the creator is a scammer but his methods to turn his ideas -this time- into reality are too radical and shaddy.

I totally agree with you... I graduated in Milan year and a half ago and started investing in crypto earlier but in my time there i never heard anyone in the faculty talking about bitcoin and i knew lot of people since i studied in both english and Italian. I remember some friends who study engineering  were ahead, but architecture buaj never. 
I dont know now that we had a massive bullrun in late 2017 if people are starting to think more about it, but trying to bring all this concept to Architecture seems bit ridiculous to me... Im one of those who think ‘almost everything’ outside bitcoin is either a scam or its gonna be dead soon. Centralized databases have proved to be way more effective than those slow/not scalable ‘blockchain projects. Who know maybe im wrong and this world end up being fully decentralized in the future, but as of today after seeing this ICO massive scam wave im very skeptic about them. 
The real development is in Bitcoin, the world deserves a better method of payment and a better and decentralized currency. Bitcoin definitely offers that and much more.
Time will tell, bur im pretty happy you got into that competition, at least that proves world is slowly moving into at least ‘something different’ . Good luck, the fact that you are here asking this questions make i  think puts you couple of steps ahead everyone else if they really meant it that way :).

You must understand that price doesnt follow adoption... that is TOTAL BULLSHIT, we dropped the gold standard in the 70s and yet thats when the price skyrocketed cuz people actually started appreciating it more for its properties like scarcity. 
Price doesnt matter at all when it comes to the real use case, we dont need a 10000000000€ bitcoin for using it. The whole world could be using Bitcoin and its price being 1€ as long as they are transacting and spending everyday, price really comes into the game when people hodl and appreciate the asset, when people invest not trade.

Architect here mate... this is a big issue within the crypto community, everyone wants to somehow connect cryptocurrencies to their business and invent the next big ‘decentralized/blockchain’ for whatever the hell they do! That is very very wronnng!
Architecture and Blockchain got nothing to do with each other, stop wasting your time thinking about creating decentralized things in design otherwise you r gonna find yourself collecting money to fund the next big scam. 
Here’s a nice interview to Piere Rochard, where he talks about it, the interviewer plants the idea of decentralized properties, real state business and so on, he respond very accurately. I invite you toWatch it.

No! I dont have to stop any narrative, i was one of the most ignorant human beings regarding all these computer alike stuff, i had never opened the terminal or written a single line of code before. The things i have learnt while setting up my ln node are priceless.. and tbh its not as hard as many people think, once you read a bit, ask questions and do some reverse engineering you start felling like god, and i deeply think that at this early point of bitcoin if you really want to be here you should get your hands dirt and learn more about, and running your own fn + ln is a really good exercise and test. 
On the other hand, eclair and bw have really good insentives but they don’t offer the kind of sovergnity a full node offers.

No, I think you are wrong... Again, revisit your first post where you claimed that “You have 100 full BitcoinS” with capital B  two minutes before saying the obvious that Bitcoin with capital B refers to the software/technology. The amount of incongruences in your posts are crazy ( but luckily you have 5+ years of experience with BitcoinS) 
I still think that S wether you have 1 or 10( we know u/viper29097 have more than one don’t worry)  is absurd... but maybe thats cuz my English sucks.

My main intention with lightning was helping the network by running my own node and stop trusting other 3rd parties whenever i need to verify my own transactions, but yeh this is very early and you can start earning few satoshis for routing payments and as bitcoin price increases those satoshis might be worth something one day :). Altho right now few ‘hubs’ take the bigger chunk it will keep growing decentralized and robust.

If you try to cheat submitting an old state after you send me some bitcoins, there’s always a lockout period before you can actually spend those coins in a horrible world you could get away with it if i don’t go online in that period, but if i do and the it gets reported then the whole amount we committed to the channel  goes instantly to my node.

I bought the apox box (which contains a raspberry pi model 3 with 16gb sd card, hdmi cable, 5amp power cable and the plastic box for the pi) for 72€ but im sure it could be bit cheaper + toshiba hard disk 500gb 40€. 
Regarding the blockchain im synching atm on the raspi (it can be done much faster on your personal computer but since the pi is connected via ethernet then its fine for me) and it took 1 day to reach 20% which is not bad whatsoever.

Yeh, many would find themselves in the same situation if you dont wanna give 30% of something you bought with tons of risks without any insurance... cuz there’s where the deal is, they want you to pay taxes on gains withdrawals and so on, but no entity would fuking give you some kind of insurance for the asset you r buying like when u do with stocks or bonds and all that, if they suddenly go to 0 you wouldnt lose all your money, but with btc....

As far as im concerned the capacity remains the same since this is a multisig contract where we both commit x amount of bitcoin that returns the same amount you committed minus the amount you used transferring it to the other party once the final tx is agreed and broadcasted to the blockchain.

Prolly these and many other buzzwords were stumbling in the heads of ignorant investors back in December. I do have many friend that bought thinking bitcoin could never go down ans i net there were millions like them since the price shot up like nothing from 10k to 20k. But thats not all, when prices started to fall slightly, many of them kept buying thinking it couldn’t go down further, now 8 months later with a 65% here we are waiting for that massive triangle to breakdown...
SO YES! People bought at very high prices cuz they had no idea what they were getting into. But you didnt. You clearly saw the top and sild your bag to the little fellas who bought a 20k right?

Bat still a shit/scam coin created out of thin air to make profits from ignorant/incompetent investors. Fuking creators control almost all that shit. How is that fking fair?

@_date: 2019-01-09 07:30:14
No man! Go and follow the atticus, i set my node up in a week and i had never opened the terminal before in my life... i learnt sooo many things about coding that im thinking of keep learning and even maybe sometime in my life try to find a job cuz i really loved what i just did... 
You should definitely try to run your own node and you will never regret the things youll learn + you will be saving well over 200$ that you can use later if you want try lightning on mainnet
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:25:39
Stop reading wikipedia, it will end up shrinking your brain ‘MoreS’
Now that u own BitcoinS and talk about SatoshiS  go and see if you can find the word BitcoinS in the whitepaper BitcoinerS holderS

I dont think coinbase will ever implement lightning... if they could they wont even use bitcoin, those rats are only doing it cuz they get tons of $! Fuk them!
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:20:27
I missed the hard disk... 
-A raspberry pi it doesnt even have to be the model 3 since you wont be using wifi at least i dont.
-A 5amp power adapter for the pi
-A 16gb micro sd
-500 gb hard disk
-ethernet cable
You can get all that for under 100$, 
Thats 200$ cheaper and you wont have to trust their software.
Edit:/ im not bashing on casa... they are doing a great job, kudos to them! But they should stop with the robinhood rhetoric cuz they are making load of moniez with every box they sell.

Im one of those who believe that people should get into bitcoin for its store of value preposition first, then and only after they realize how amazing this technology is, then, they can start spending their bitcoins -if they want- easier than they spend their national ccy.
It is a very stupid preposition of altcoins such as bcash trying to get people in for the wrong reasons.. Lets be honest, today the easiest way to buy goods and spend your money is using a centralized governmental ccy, and that not gonna change any time soon.

Anyone knows anything about it? 
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:34:42
I would argue you that spending in shit is any good at all for bitcoin...
Who said that hodling and have it as a store of value is bad?

Last time i checked u are the one repeating what a man ( Ber ) likes to call a coin! I can call bcash the way I want! This is not a fuking business to anyone. The only people butthurt because others call bcash bcash is robert and all his minions ( u included ) no one in bitcoin would give me a hard time for calling it the way i want NO! But you and your boyfriends at r/bcash are just blowing the dick of a man who thinks he owns that community! You and your community are a cancer since you dont even express what you feel, you just go around repeating and supporting a fake god! Me, on the other hand i go with btc because i decided to, no one had to put in my head how or how not to call it cuz i do whatever the hell i want... thats the beautiful thing of freedom. You keep just doing what dickie tells you to do! Over!
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:03:26

@_date: 2018-04-19 19:44:54
Who doesnt ;)
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:33:18
Not as in violence, but hes old enough to realize that he is the most controversial/hated person in this space and yet he keeps splitting the community in vain. 
I have never seen any bitcoin developer actively/publicly attacking bcash as often as this guy do +  i dont get why he keeps getting invited to places to talk about bitcoin when the very second he has he just switch to bcash and begins with his never ending script designed by him.  
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:24:49
Ive been thinking the same for a while. I live in spain and i have never seen a single btc atm in a country where crypto is legal! This could be a massive way of spreading the word.
What about those regulatory requirements for spain?

Many users prefer not to take sides in this cancerous discussion but How can someone stay so calm when the FACE and LORD of one of those sides (the copy one) is transmitting so much hate thru his words. You can clearly seen everytime he speaks about Bitcoin how serious his mental ill is.  
Really sorry for the rant but couldnt avoid to post this in here since i had to stop watching this video cuz its everytime THE SAME BULLSHIT FROM THAT GUY!

@_date: 2018-04-19 05:43:32
That’s when u realize that all his rhetoric is pure bs, hea treating that as a business - as his business - and indeed seems like he owns everyone in there. I have never seen someone like him in all this years talking about bitcoin. This guy makes it look centralized as fuk
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:50:07
Dont u guys forget the lawsuit taking place atm vs the bitcoin.com scammy website! Theres also a telegram group happening and things are running smooth we might get out something good out of this situation this time.

Maybe just maybe... but running that node profitably should be the least of your concerns, keep in mind that some miners would mine on a loss just to help the network, that should be the goal, helping the network and build the future of finance.

As long as people, especially the poor, can easily exchange whatever the hell they have for bitcoin, hodl it and use it, they will be much better off with btc than the rest of the trash out there.
