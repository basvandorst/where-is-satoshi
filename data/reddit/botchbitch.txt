Thanks for the tip! It didn't work though :(


What does this mean? And how can I correct it...?

I might look in to that, for the moment however I think I'm just going to go CashU to bitcoin nordic and hope for the best. 
Thanks for your help, it has been much appreciated.

Thanks, I was reading that but wasn't quite sure if bitcoin nordic was the way to go. Can't you add bitcoins to mtgox with cashu too?

Hey, thanks! I'll check that out for sure. 
Just a quick question about how this thing works though, I send him the ukash information and then he sends the money to my wallet (something like blockchain)?
Sorry if what I'm asking is monumentally stupid or obvious.
Also, will it make a difference if my ukash voucher is in euro when he specifys pounds (as long as it equals the same amount of course)

I've been looking for a way to contact him to ask, but I can't find anything... Do you know how I can go about it? Going through him seems like the simplest option I have open to me.
That mastercard repower thing is definitely interesting, Ill have to look into it. 
And if you do ever start selling bitcoins for ukash, hit me up and I would love to purchase some from you :)

Ahh ok. Bitcoin nordic it is then.

Yeah, I haven't quite sussed how to use bitcoin-otc yet, as I am on a torbrowser. Ill do some research and check back in, unless you have any advice?
