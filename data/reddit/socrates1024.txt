Mixing, including using CoinJoin or Cryptonote, requires multiple transactions to get good privacy, whereas ZC basically gets the best possible privacy in one transaction. I don't know what you mean when you say that using CoinJoin "reduces blockchain use".... relative to what?
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:26:29
It would be possible to combine CT with Cryptonote ring signatures. Detailed comparison of this and other approaches would be good scope for another blogpost. 
The main disadvantage is that this would prevent pruning. You mention you heard about a way to do pruning with Cryptonote, but I am not familiar with that and am skeptical about it!
Also, see my comment elsewhere on this thread: Cryptonote and CoinJoin both require multiple transactions to ensure good mixing, while ZC gives the best possible privacy in a single transaction.

Sure, I agree completely. Any instance of a phrase like "actually useful" comes from some blog article or comment, not from the Permacoin authors. 
... although there are a few places in the paper where we say "wasted" but should probably instead have just said "consumed" or "spent".
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:43:20
Sure, in the Permacoin paper we were careful not to say that Bitcoin is a waste - we don't think it is! But even if it's not a waste, if it's possible to get more value for the same expense, then we should take it.

Sure, Bitcoin isn't a significant waste if it's useful. But it's still reasonable (and a good goal) to try to squeeze more efficiency out of it by getting more for free.
Storage is cheap, but there is not currently a good decentralized *incentivized* distributed storage system. You could host a backup file with Bittorrent, but how would you set up a fund to pay for thousands of anonymous seeds? That's what Permacoin aims at.

maaku7, don't forget the non-plaintext option. 
It's possible for an honest solo-miner to claim a winning ticket without having to build a zero-knowledge proof. This takes hardly any time at all, only a few extra hashes.
Also, the ZK tech is improving all the time. Our implementation used Pinocchio, but libsnark is (supposedly) orders of magnitude faster for constructing proofs.
As we noted in the end, our use of ZK actually requires less than what SNARKs actually provide. We don't need the extractability property, or the succinctness. This means ordinary NIZK could be used, so it's much more likely we'd be able to find a scheme that doesn't need a trusted setup.
Indeed, though, MUCH more work needs to be done, this is really just a start. Calling for a rushed hard-fork is not appropriate yet (though the discussion should get started asap)

Here's my ELI5 explanation of sidechains. (Disclaimer: I'm an independent researcher, not an employee or consultant of BlockStream).
Let's say you wanted to have a club (or a company, or some other name for an organization) that performs a variety of functions. It has an bake sale, a raffle, does some donations at the end of the year. Maybe it also has an internal "club tokens" currency which can be passed around and maybe can be used as discounts.
This club could maintain a little warchest of Bitcoins. These Bitcoins would come in handy for carrying out the club's functions. The club's bake sale might accept Bitcoin payments at its bake sale - proceeds go directly into the club fund. At the raffle, one of the prizes might include a few Bitcoins taken from that fund. The club might use its Bitcoin fund to match donations from its members. 
Complementary currencies like the "club tokens" are economic experiments of their own - no hard and fast rules how to manage them. One (plausible) way get the club tokens to take off (to the moon!) is to set a "floor" value for them - if you have a token, you can sell it back to the club for 10 millibits (at least as long as there's enough btc in the club's fund to cover it). A portion of the club's fund might be set aside for this (to prevent defaulting if everyone sells their tokens back at once). Hopefully the tokens end up with a *higher* value than 10 millibits, but setting a floor value is thought to bolster consumer confidence.
All of these are things you could do with Bitcoin today, without needing sidechains.... but the club would have to have an officer (a Treasurer) who oversees the Bitcoin fund and is trusted not to embezzle from it!
Suppose instead of having a trusted treasury officer, you wanted to run your club on a public proof-of-work blockchain of its own. You would start by writing down the club's operating rules in a computer-readable programming language. You might think the next step is to fork bitcoind and launch your blockchain as an altcoin. But how would the Bitcoin fund work?
In the version with the treasury officer, the officer kept track of the private keys that lets him move Bitcoins around on behalf of the club. But a public proof-of-work blockchain has no private key.... the closest thing it has is its proof-of-work chain itself, which functions a bit like a signature.
In Bitcoin today, the only way you can store bitcoins is if you know a secret key corresponding to your address. Sidechains lets an altcoin have its own Bitcoin account. Instead of using its secret key to sign transactions, it moves bitcoins around by building proof-of-work. ***The "address" of a sidechain is its genesis block, and the "signature" of a sidechain is a long proof-of-work chain extending from its genesis block.***
Note about the phrase "2-way peg":
I hope this explanation was helpful, especially the examples of things that a club (or altcoin) might do with a Bitcoin fund. The paper refers to this overall technique as "2-way peg", which suggests that the main intended use is to have an altcoin currency that's backed-by-and-denominated-in Bitcoins. Even though the club in my example has a club tokens currency, it's not integral to the club's functions and I didn't suggest that the club should sell its club tokens for Bitcoins or denominate them in Bitcoins. (The "floor value" in my example could be described as 1-way peg). Having a 2-way pegged currency is for sure possible, but not the only thing you can do with the sidechains technique. So, overall I prefer thinking of this as a way for an altcoin to have its own Bitcoin account or treasury fund.

I don't understand how this isn't vulnerable to malleability attacks. In our discussion above, you said that it's not vulnerable because a script can only create transactions based on the inputs that triggered it. But here you are describing a script that can be activated by cron or by small "dust" transactions that in particular are smaller than the amount that the script moves.
 balance&lt;addr is computed using blockchain.info, which I believe does not wait for any confirmations. If only a dust transaction triggers this script, then 10% of the balance is much larger, which means send&lt;addr moves outputs other than the ones used to trigger the script.
The significance of this is that even if a dust transaction triggers this script, the momentary balance may appear to be larger than it actually is due to 0-conf transactions that later get revised.

The point of Permacoin is to add decentralized storage to Bitcoin while *preserving* Bitcoin's underlying incentive structure.
MaidSafe has a completely different structure than Bitcoin, in particular it is not based on Proof-of-Work. I can't really comment on whether MaidSafe's security claims are as compelling as Bitcoin's - but this doesn't matter, the point is that it's *different*. For sure, Bitcoin has seen more use and survived trial-by-fire than MaidSafe, but this isn't necessarily a good indicator.

Right, all of the above are good points. Permacoin is essentially a design concept, it could be integrated in a variety of ways. I think it's most plausible it could be a component of an altcoin, or something like a sidechain. Maybe Ethereum would find this useful.
So on one hand it's not an integral part of Permacoin that we intend to *compete* with Bitcoin as an altcoin (despite the unfortunate titles of some of the articles about Permacoin), on the other it seems unlikely Bitcoin proper would adopt this anytime soon.

This kind of "escrow" is basically useless. 
In traditional (real estate) escrow, the escrow agent receives both the money/payment, and the title to the real estate being purchased, and only completes the transaction when the title is verified.
In this kind of escrow, the escrow agent receives the payment, but not the item being purchased! (Since, obviously, it costs a lot more to ship the item twice, and you have to worry if the escrow agent might steal it.) This means that the buyer can say "I received an empty box!" and the escrow agent has no way of knowing whether this is a lie or not.
This BitXBay says something like "a 5% deposit is included so both parties have a 5% incentive to cooperate." Basically is the same idea as in  which is flawed for the same reason. The idea is that 5% of the payment is locked up, and either both parties say "yes the transaction was successful", or else it's burned and no one gets it. The problem is, it's not actually true that cooperation is a nash equilibrium here, since *THE PLAYERS CAN COMMUNICATE OUT OF BAND!*. The seller can say "look, you seem unsatisfied with your purchase, but I'm not admitting fault. Instead of us both losing 5%, just finalize the transaction and I'll split the difference with you."

This at least partially a reference to a talk I gave, called ["Ethereum Isn't Turing Complete and it Doesn't Matter Anyway"]( (with a "red herring" theme for emphasis), as well as a series of technical papers about smart contract applications:
-[Zero-Collateral Lotteries in Bitcoin and Ethereum]( 
-[Sprites: Payment Channels that Go Faster than Lightning](
The main takeaway point from these works is that there are some applications that are inherently impossible (or at least more complex and expensive) in Bitcoin script, but simple in Ethereum. The reason has to do with having scriptable access to persistent state, but nothing to do Turing completeness.

"redblack.py" is a very generic tree, "utxo_merkle.py" defines an accumulator.

As exciting as this idea is, it brushes up against a known impossibility result in theoretical cryptography.
In order to pay for itself, the agent would need to be capable of producing digitally signed messages (e.g., bitcoin transactions). In order to safely spawn new instances on rental servers, it would have to function even if the the server host is untrusted.
What you would want is a way of embedding the private key in the agent's code, such that the agent is able to sign messages but the host cannot extract the key and steal the agent's endowment.
This idea is known as *program obfuscation*, and unfortunately, it is generally impossible. See ["On the Impossibility of Program Obfuscation"]( by Boaz Barak, et al., or [an informal description of the proof](
@_date: 2012-08-22 23:21:58
Here is an illustration of the procedure.
1) You begin with the tree at time T. The previous operation was an insertion of element 10, although you couldn't know that just by looking at this tree.
2) You fetch the merkle path (VO) that allows you to simulate the insertion operation on tree T-1. You already know the root hash for T-1, so you can verify this operation is correct. You would need to look at the transaction itself to know that "insert 10" is the operation in scope.
3) The tree at time T-1 contains a subset of the nodes in the union of the VO and your tree at time T. The shape is uniquely determined by the root hash. You can now perform any query on T-1 by beginning with the root hash and traversing down.
@_date: 2012-08-22 19:53:11


This is exactly the idea. Off-loading storage to the (untrusted) network is the ideal solution.
Suppose your known-valid-backup is N blocks in the past. That means there are N unique UTXO-trees you could ask for. Each of these trees contains M elements.
However, most of the trees share redundant data (since only O(log M) new nodes are created each update). It will require O(N log M) to store all the data for all the UTXO-sets. Imagine that all of this data is stored on a public distributed hash table (sharded, shared between mutually untrusting nodes). By making secure (hash -&gt; preimage) queries to the network, you can reconstruct any UTXO directly, without needing to rollback or designate checkpoints.
Even better, you can use this DHT to "query" any UTXO from the past without needing to download or serialize the entire thing.

I'm fascinated by local complementary currencies. There was an excellent survey of local currencies in Japan, over 600 of them. 
@_date: 2012-08-22 21:58:24
Here is an abstract definition for what I mean by a DHT:
    class HashTable digest node m where
         hash :: node -&gt; m digest
         unhash :: digest -&gt; m node
One instance of this could be an ordinary on-disk key-value store, where 'hash' computes the digest and stores the node data on the disk. 'Unhash' is a database lookup.
Another instance would allow you to 'replay' a short sequence of data (called a Validation Object, or VO), simulating a query that touches just the necessary nodes. In this case, 'unhash' would recompute the digest, validating each piece of data.
An Identity instance occurs when node = digest is the same type. In this case, the computation is equivalent to an ordinary recursive redblack tree.
There's no need to store rotation/undo information in the block header. Suppose you have the UTXO-set at time T. You want to obtain the UTXO-set for time T-1. You already have the block header for T-1, which contains the root hash for the desired tree. You must download (or otherwise obtain, i.e., "unhash") the O(log M) path of node data (a VO) necessary to simulate the forward operation from T-1 to T. You now have the complete UTXO-set for T-1. This is the low-memory low-connectivity high-time linear-traversal method for obtaining old UTXOs.

Sure, you're talking about Greg Maxwell's ["StorJ" proposal](
After rereading his post, and the wiki article, as well as chatting with gmaxwell, I realize that I may have overreacted. Both proposals are very careful not to cross the line of the obfuscation impossibility result.
For example, the agent can rent "storage" and "bandwidth" services without having to trust the provider. Whoever hosts the agent itself, however, must be trusted to execute the agent's code correctly.
While the proposals were very careful, I feel that many people (including in this thread) will not notice the line in the sand that the authors were careful not to cross. Language like "self replicating," "artificial lifeform," and "autonomous agent," to me suggest a stronger variation than what's actually proposed.
Here are some examples of things an agent can't do:
  * Suppose there's an agent where you send it a secret (encrypted with the agent's public key). The agent uses the secret to sign one message, then throws away the key. This isn't secure, because whoever hosts the agent will be able to eavesdrop on the decrypted secret.
  * Suppose an agent is programmed to collect bitcoin donations and later disburse them to either the EFF or Wikileaks, according to some algorithm. There's no way you can know the agent's host executes the code you expect, so the bitcoins could easily be sent to some unknown third recipient instead.
Even these scenarios can be secure, if you're willing to trust a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), which is mentioned in the original link. But TPMs require a significant amount of trust in the central party that constructs the device (who could otherwise install backdoors or make mistakes, without anyone noticing). This notion of security is at odds with the idealistic language used here.
I'm curious if anyone else feels that these phrases (autonomous self replicating artificial lifeforms) are misleading, given the degree of trust required of the hosts?

@_date: 2012-08-22 01:47:32
I'm not on the core bitcoin-dev team. I have yet to contribute any code that is mature enough or stable enough to belong in production. The idea of using balanced Merkle trees for transaction validation in Bitcoin should mostly be credited to gmaxwell and etotheipi. 
There is some disagreement regarding which datastructure should be used to implement this tree - most of the developers (roconnor, sipa, gmaxwell, etotheipi) are skeptical of my suggestion to use RedBlack trees, and would prefer to use a Trie. It's difficult to tell which (if any) is the right answer, especially because of a lack of clear problem requirements. I haven't convinced them yet.
They are right to be skeptical. They absolutely need to be! There are numerous proposals for "alt chains," most of which involve *more* centralization, rather than less. I am only interested in going in the other direction, which requires solving technical problems. If I'm correct in my approach, then eventually it will be self-evident, and Bitcoin will adopt the best data-structure. There is still a long way to go.
Most of the challenge at this point is in clarifying the assumptions and problem requirements. We can't decide which implementation to develop until we get a better grasp on what it needs to be able to do.
I suggest focusing on this scenario:
   Assume that you have already validated the entire chain once. Also assume that you make small secure backups every so often, containing just the "head" of the block chain (one hash).
   Now imagine that all of your machines and storage are lost in a fire. You dig out one of your backups. How do you get back up to speed on the network, without trusting *ANYTHING* else except your own tiny backup?
Current implementations of Bitcoin require a full rescan of the *entire* blockchain, even all the stuff you've previously validated, in order to build up the necessary database/indices. For this scenario, the datastructure I'm defending works the best. I'm trying to argue that this scenario is the most fundamental. Whoever finds the optimal way to solve this problem will also have found a blockchain structure that can be efficiently validated from scratch (or from a trusted checkpoint).
This problem statement is my main contribution.

A friend told me I could buy _anything_, over IRC, using fake money, in an open-air marketplace, moderated by a robot bouncer using an old-fashioned GPG web-of-trust. It worked perfectly. (The transaction, I mean. Not the dildo - that's irrelevant.)

Please do! I would be very grateful for help with this. I will literally shit bitcoins.

Hmph. I'd really like to go! I have been procrastinating on a visit to San Francisco for about... four years now.

definitely a good choice, especially if it includes mimblewimble crypto in some way

1) Performance... a 3/5 multisignature requires 3x the size of an ordinary signature and takes 3x as long to verify. But a 3/5 threshold signature requires exactly the same size as an ordinary signature.
2) Privacy... multisigs have a distinctive structure that makes them recognizable. If you want to use a 7/22 multisig for some reason (maybe it makes sense for your business structure?) then good luck using coinjoin etc. to mix your coins, since probably no one else is using multisigs that look like that. Threshold signatures look just the same as ordinary signatures, regardless of the access policy.
This question is also answered eslewhere in this thread!

I don't think this historical correlation, while entirely true (and stated correctly/precisely), supports raising the block size limit. And, except for this comment, I don't think you're saying it is either.
By "facts that support this viewpoint", are you meaning to include the 92% historical correlation?

What was this graph generated from? Seems like this is the output of some simulation model with initial parameters representing the node distributions today.
@_date: 2015-10-07 17:32:41
What do you think is the best explanation for this correlation? I'm curious what comes next, but I don't think there are any immediate "takeaways" from this yet.
I remember seeing that price historically correlates well with google search volume of the word "bitcoin", which is also intuitive.
The obvious explanation is that the price of Bitcoin goes up when there are more potential users that get interested and hear about it on the news.... this also causes tx volume to go up.
Maybe it would be interesting to control for "exchange volume" vs transaction volume (i.e., off-chain transactions vs on-chain transactions).
Also - is the size of *each* transaction constant over time? (# transactions per block vs. size of block) (I imagine so...)

No - in that post he ack'ed ribuck's explanation of it, but the idea first occurs earlier from puddinpop and ribuck 
@_date: 2015-10-07 23:37:49


I don't understand why correlation with price (while the limit is not reached) supports this viewpoint (in favor of a policy decision to remove the limit).
It seems like this viewpoint would be most strongly supported by evidence that encountering the limit will stifle adoption.

This is a new and improved version. I think you read an older draft of the paper from last year. The new version fixes some errors and has a new algorithm to get rid of the trusted setup phase

Hmm. Didn't realize Satoshi posted in that thread. His tone doesn't seem surprised, still I wonder if the pools protocol was unanticipated.
@_date: 2015-02-24 05:04:07
Show them the textbook and these lectures, slides, exercises. It makes starting a lot easier and safer to start a course if someone else has done it first and you can use their material as a starting point.
@_date: 2015-10-02 14:16:57
I don't think Satoshi foresaw the pooled mining protocol. Nothing the author cited addresses this. 
Also, when Satoshi says minority forks are dangerous, it doesn't seem plausible that this involves merge mining. It's easy to make a fork that isn't merge mineable, for example, XT isn't merge mineable.
In general, while we take it for granted now, I think it's underappreciated just how surprising and clever the merged mining and pooled mining protocols are!

Everything you're saying is right, but it's about median rather than expected value. The median path length would be 6.6, the expected path length is 10.

You might find this post interesting:  (I'm plugging my own post, sorry!) It's on the topic of why unprofitable Bitcoin mining is to be expected, based on modern theories of economic behavior. People might participate because you have a *small chance* of winning a *very big* reward, like getting lucky and winning several blocks in a row. Similar to why people buy lottery tickets.

(I'm who recorded this podcast) The Bitcoin *whitepaper* describes an altruistic model, where 51% of the mining power is *honest.* So the closest we have to a formal security definition and analytical proof is in the *altruistic model*. And this is what most use to describe it. You're absolutely right that Bitcoin wouldn't have lasted if it was dependent on altruism... but we don't yet have a very clear understanding of what it makes the incentive scheme work.
It's not yet clear that *greedy behavior* actually points in the desired direction. The main point of this conversation was to give one example of a scenario in which the *greedy behavior* is noticeably different than the *honest behavior* - when there's a very large transaction fee at stake!
Are there any other circumstances where greedy behavior differs from honest behavior? How much more expensive could validation get before Bitcoin wouldn't be secure enough? These are worthwhile questions to discuss.
@_date: 2013-05-06 06:22:51
I apologize for lack of clarity and hope you'll give me another chance. I like talking about Bitcoin and feedback is helpful.
But there was a directly falsifiable hypothesis in this conversation which is that greedy behavior will observably differ from honest behavior precisely when there is an anomalously large transaction fee at stake. And it's because anyone implementing a "rational mining program" would choose to fight over those fees, at least up to some point.
Unfortunately for me there haven't been terribly many huge-fee blocks, and there doesn't seem to be any ridiculous behavior that's occurred during those. My retort would be that that's because no one has implemented rational mining.
