Future migrant worker here. Visited Dubai a few weeks back to get a feel for the place and I couldn't get over the amount of people queuing at Western Unions in many of the shopping malls over there.
Spotted these queues on a number of occasions while I was there and couldn't help but think how much money could be saved if they were to cut out the middle-man and use Bitcoin...

Looking back on it, I actually agree with you. I'm just feeling a bit contrary tonight. Although your comment about everything being good no matter how bad got me! I'm seeing too many 'oh but r/bitcoin will say this is good news' lately.
It is pretty easy to write bad code, and I'd definitely agree that more skill is required to improve on bad code.

Regardless of whether or not GHash is 'evil', it should be in the best interest of the Bitcoin community to have a varied pool distribution.
If Bitcoin is going to be as BIG and important as we all believe it will be at some point in the future, we should not have to put such trust in a single mining pool. We should not have to rely on the perceived 'Evil-ness' of a pool in order to sleep at night.

I'm not trolling.
You brought up the issue about Bitcoin not being the currency of the future. I was highlighting, with the example of the internet, that you cannot pass too hard a judgement on a technology that is in such an early stage. Ofcourse there are dangers with using such a new technology.
I.e. The internet has become easier and safer to use over time. Just as Bitcoin will hopefully be if the community and development continue to progress at their current pace.
It's not recommended to invest your life-savings in Bitcoin, just as it isn't recommended to store large amounts of Bitcoin on an exchange, just as it isn't recommended to store credit/debit card details on your pc...etc.
Common sense prevails, but yes there are exceptions.

Thanks a lot! =)

OP has a point. Messy code in the grand scale of things is a pretty petty thing to critisise one person over.


Point being....?
Jumping on the 'are delusional', 'this is actually good' troll bandwagon I see. 
Original, good job.

It's the principle.
The public perception of Bitcoin is that the barrier of entry is quite high. This however, as we all know, is not the case. 
As a merchant, there is no risk in accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, once the payment is converted to fiat. Which is something Bitpay et al make quite easy to do.

Funny how you constantly remind us 'shills' how dumb we are for investing(gambling) in this ponzi scheme / shitcoin.
Yet, when questioned about your motives for posts like these on this subreddit, which I might add got boring several months ago, you highlight how 'good', 'unfortunate' people have lost their retirement funds etc. because of this bitchcoin. Logic!
"hehe, my cousin is a mod here, you can never get me banned"
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:14:13
I'm not going to read the entire post but I presume you're highlighting the existence of a delusional tone to this subreddit? If so, I'd again, have to agree...
Time to sleep ZzZ

Do you think that internet adoption was smooth-sailing in it's infancy when it was becoming mainstream back in the 90's? 
Do you think people were fully-aware how to browse safely and securely without becoming victims of tech-savvy predators back then too?
If you answer yes to either of these questions, you sir, are the deluded person here.

Ugh..really? Just what Bitcoin needs...more dodgy media.
It won't take long for the 'Newsweek' calibre of 'journalists' to pick up on this Brock guy.
I can see it now - "Bitcoin Board of Directors now joined by underage child molester"

Money doesn't need to come in to the equation when talking about safety on the internet. Saying that the internet was safe before money came in the picture is just ridiculous.
Identity theft, classified information, viruses etc. are some of the earlier problems that existed (and still do) on the internet. Something that **early** users/adopters were unfortunate enough to become victims of because they were using a technology still in it's **infancy**.
Bitcoin is still an experiment in a very early stage of development and isn't as perfect as it could be. Time will iron out any imperfections it has and inherently make it become a lot more user-friendly.

Thread hi-jack.
I'm recommending another bitcoin casino site-
Choose from Blackjack and Poker! Nice site run by a friendly chap.

One possible improvement would be to muck the cards after a short period once a hand has been played out.
Ie. Once I win/lose my hand, after say 3/4 seconds both my cards and the dealers cards would be mucked. The player is then given the option to play the next hand etc.
The way it is at the moment - you win/lose you hand, you're given the option to bet (start a new hand), but your cards are still displayed. Might cause confusion?
Another small thing. When joining a table, the max buy-in should default to the user's max balance. Ie. when I press max buy-in, all my funds in my account are brought to the table.
Just my 2c =)

Don't buy any of them.
Do some research and you will see it's not profitable to mine BTC anymore, nor is it wise to buy from Butterfly Labs given their current rep within this community.
TLDR; Stay away from mining BTC.
