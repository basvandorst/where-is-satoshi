Lol i even checked their twitter but didn't realoze they have a sticky post or something and all the new posts are below it... 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:22:05
Looks like they are back up... Now to log in and check on my account...

I've enjoyed using them, though I once had an ACH transfer from my bank take over a week and, also not pre-credit for trading. But that was only once. Unfortunately the delay prevented me from buying a really good dip.

I *am* using another exchange.

I guess he/she could perhaps just move it to a new wallet and wait to see if it becomes uber-valuable.  
On that note, if OP intends to remove coins that are still in the wallet after a few months, he should definitely note that on the paperwallet, so that people who want to hold onto them know to move them into their own new secure wallet.

I bought coins on cbx about a month ago, and it was incredibly easy.  Have they stopped accepting Dwolla too?
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:37:16
It does look like a low-effort visual design, and at least for me there's a consistent 5-or-more second delay for pages to load.  That said, they accept dwolla (which is why I chose them in the first place) and I aside from the above I have had zero issues with them (since Thursday).

Believe this guy.  His sources are airtight.

Look I don't think Gox has done a good job either, but this whole thing is speculative and was ready to pop any time.  Perhaps their technical issues triggered it, but there are other exchanges and it was probably bound to happen sooner or later regardless.

Not a top-level comment?

Or they could just buy something with the BTC without converting it to $.

I suppose a better situation would be if there were several solid exchanges with activity split more evenly between them.  I suspect we will see movement towards this after the unfortunate last few days.
Just echoing what I'm reading all over the place of course.

Don't worry, if it has been confirmed at least once, it's extremely unlikely that it won't make it.  Just be patient.

Pick an exchange and do what you wanna.  Is this a troll post?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:03:26
Of course that's fair, and I'm not arguing with the policy.  It does however seem to give cause for concern; if a single exchange manages such a large share of the market that its health can greatly affect the exchange rate, then insiders with advance knowledge of its less-than-transparent plans can use this knowledge to unfair advantage trading on other exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:24:03
Yeah, take speculative trading advice from someone anonymous on the internet.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:40:20
Investment advice is never a good idea to give.

I didn't lose any money at all, I just closed it preemptively before I get randomly stung by using the wrong service.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:35:56
The fact that Gox accept Dwolla as a form of payment is what's keeping there.  Wiring money is ~10x more expensive and takes longer to boot.
Which other exchanges accept Dwolla (that also have enough volume to be worthwhile)?
@_date: 2013-06-28 21:39:40
I just closed my Dwolla account because of this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:46:09
lol.  Who decides an order is "essential", what are the criteria?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:48:49
Not a question.  Downvoted.
@_date: 2013-05-20 02:37:28
I see, I guess it makes sense when you put it that way.  I would have expected the opposite, i.e. the increased difficulty/expense of getting $ *onto* gox would cause the gox price to be a bit lower, because people holding BTC can just sell it on other exchanges where it's easier to get fiat out.
Could it be that people with USD in their Gox accounts are having a hard time getting it out as USD, and so are buying more BTC in order to sell it on other exchanges,  thus increasing demand within Gox?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:48:04
Are the prohibited from trading on other exchanges?
