I'm obviously not going to tell them i plan on buying Bitcoin with it, duh.
They only need your last two paychecks if you are in a permanent full time job, which i plan to be. I'm just going to say i was studying and working a casual job before that. I think shit works differently in America. Firstly, 80k here is probably like 160k over there in terms of mental your perception of how much it actually it, even though our dollar is on parity with yours. Our minimum wages are a lot higher here and we get paid a lot more per hour than most Americans. So it's really like i would be borrowing 40-50k usd.

"Hang on sir, the value of your Bitcoin just went down $100, care to transfer across the extra 2 BTC to complete your purchase, thankyou!"

Haha, only partly true because i would have never have sold the coins as i am a long term believer in Bitcoin. Also, it depends on the timing because there was one point where Bitcoin was in the 300's and i would've bought then too.

Yesss!!!!!! I don't care if i lose the 80k, for the promise it holds it's worth the gamble, you could work 9 lifetimes and still not have the potential to earn that much in capital gains. 
What about 80k? Assuming Bitcoin goes to 0 then it's about 2 years of work in Australia, i don't have any expenses or pay rent, i can save every penny.

Actually in Australia, they only need your last 2 paychecks if you are in a full time job. Need to be employed for a period of longer than 12 months for a casual job. Are you saying they have some way to check your employment history? The only thing that matters is if your credit history is tarnished.

Like i said earlier, i live with my parents, i don't pay rent or any expenses on the bills, and they don't expect it from me. The minimum wage here is around 35k, and the job i am applying for are around 40-50k, i am fine with working for 2 years paying it off as i have no expenses, i entertain myself with online video games. That is of course assuming Bitcoin goes to 0, which it won't, i still think at worst case scenario it will retain some of it's value. Miners and minimum production cost per BTC will ensure that.

I looked at your previous posts, you really seem to have a deep hatred for the early adopters of Bitcoin and Bitcoin itself. You clearly want it to fail, and to come across someone who believes in it enough to want to take out a loan to buy some must make your blood boil. I'm going to bookmark your username and check back in a year or two and see if you are still posting, my guess is your account will probably be deleted by then or you'll be posting in Stay salty and watch as you're on the wrong side of history.
Good day!
