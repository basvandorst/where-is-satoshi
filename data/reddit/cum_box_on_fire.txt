A big bitcoin exchange (people who let you buy and sell BTC for other currency) that has been rumored to be insolvent (aka: not have funds sufficient to cover outstanding balances or transactions) had documents leaked that indicated that they were broke.
Immediately after the leak, they stopped trades entirely, essentially confirming the leak.
This would be like a bank halting all withdrawals, having rumors that they don't have enough money to cover withdrawals, and then the bank itself simply closes its doors and shuts off its ATMs.

Uh, that's not what happened. The Swedes dropped the charges because the statute of limitations expired on them and they couldn't get him extradited in time to be questioned on the other charges.
No one ever said the charges were baseless.

Assange is not an angel. He's a sociopathic attention-addict who found a niche that had arguable public service qualities and rode that pony past the grey area he started in and firmly into the black.
This is what happens when you release information to politically destabilize one government at the behest of another.

I know the 'wanted for questioning' thing was dangerous because Sweden has an extradition agreement with the US, but I was very firmly of the understanding that the allegations were sound and the warrant/extradition request was only abandoned after the statute of limitations expired. I've yet to see any evidence to the contrary of that, but I'm open to it.

I live here in the states and consider 'millionaire' to mean 'someone whose net worth is $1M or more.'
That said, it's far from an exclusive club anymore. Almost anyone who's a homeowner in an urban area of the US whose home is paid off probably qualifies at this point. That raises, of course, the question of who is holding all that real estate inventory and why...but hey.

It *might* have been late 10/early 11. I know he was working with some people with some FPGA stuff and I know he was building weird ghetto liquid cooling solutions for overclocked GPUs, and I know he was on the bleeding edge.
EDIT: but my personal knowledge of everything 2009-2011 is fuzzy due to functional alcoholism.

5 years ago I would have said he's a shitheel rapist who deserves to be in jail but avoided passing judgement against his doxxing. Now I would say that he's a narcissistic moron who was trying to destabilize the US because he was afraid of what would happen to him if Clinton became president.
Assange is a brand not a freedom fighter.

Essentially what just did.
Clinton takes national security *very* seriously, and keeping classified documents classified is a big part of that. Assange also went knives out at her way before her presidential run when she was SecState. There's a decent chance she would have had him pretty extensively questioned by the military for his role and sources in certain military secrets before he ever came to trial, and honestly probably *should* since him having sources other than C.Manning inside the DOD is a huge national security concern.
He's probably going to avoid the whole 'advanced interrogation techniques' chapter he may have otherwise been subjected to now, so that's probably better for him.

A crazy friend of mine was building hyperoptimized BTC mining rigs from 2009 on and tried to get me involved. He cashed out all of his coins at like $40 and made a huge profit on his time/hardware investment.
I wonder how he feels about selling almost 2k BTC now.

Ugh, tell me about it. I bought apple stock at around $45 a share, bought about a grand worth. Sold it a year later after it had peaked in the 80s and come down to the mid 70s to finance a move. I figured it would never go higher.
A year later, iPhone.
Now, almost a decade later, my initial roughly $1,000 investment would be worth around $12,000.  If anything, it taught me an important rule about investment: don't do it in the short term, unless you have a really good reason to.

Yeah, out of my three coinbase purchases, two of them would have been losses on delivery, no refunds.
That's fine, I'm happy to hold until it goes back up, and I expect it will. If not, I'll just convert it all to dogecoin.
