Haters have to hate because they hate themselves.
Lagunak47 probably is upset he bought an old car instead of bitcoins at $500.

I could have asked that question in 2013, when bitcoins were around $100US after starting off at $0.06 in 2009/2010. It depends how people want to use their coins. You do not need to by a whole coin.  I use mine as a storage of wealth and long-term appreciation. Over the past 10 years, bitcoin value has grown by a factor of 10 every halving period. I have been buying in Jan 2019, when bitcoins dropped to $3600US. I bought in increments of $250US which buys me a fraction of a bitcoin. So as the price changes, and there is a cycle and reason for the price change, I just get more or less bitcoins per US dollar. BTW, I had one student in 2013 who owned bitcoins. He got into it and at 24, after graduation he raised $26M for a blockchain idea. At 27, he is now a multi- millionaire. In 2013, I thought about buying 200 coins with $16,000, I had saved from a real estate deal. But decided, it was to risky. At 63, I am still buying and going all in. Will have 10 coins by Jan 2020. The next peak I'll be reached by late 2021/ early 2022. Will be a factor of 10 over 2017/2018 peak of $20,000US+\-.

You are right.

Let me put it this way:
In 1997,  I bought stock in Sears at $60/share. It was a household name, my Dad owned it. Institutions owned it.
I was going to buy this new stock called Amazon ($18), but my Dad said it was too risky. My friends said I was wasting my money and should go with them on a cruise, my neighbor laughter me. ��
If you understand the fundamentals, then you invest.
I buy real estate that other do not want. And always made a lot of money.
Fools buy when it's hot, investors buy when it's not.

This is what my Grandfather told me about computers in 1987. " A personal computer was a fad and programming them was useless." I needed to get a real job.

I did not say that. This is the best time to buy. Between 9 months and 3 months away from having. I will be all in by March '20. Having around May '20. Slow rise thru Aug '21. Run to over $100k starts July/Aug '21 thru Dec '21.

It's based on tracking bitcoin prices since the start and looking at price movement during each halving.
The price grows by a factor of 10 every four years. Eight years ago. Bitcoin price was around $3- $4. Four years ago, bitcoin price was between $400 and $500.  This year $7,000 to $8,000. Dec 2023?

This is one major reason I started buying Bitcoin at $3,500. When rich guys say do not buy but are buying it behind the seen, its time to buy.  Jamie Diamond is another one.  He calls it garbage but J.P. Morgan is getting involved.

Remember bitcoin is global. $1T is a small amount of global assets. In 2018 there was $317T in global wealth. At an annual average growth rate of 2%, that's over $6T in additional wealth each year. 
At $100,000 per bitcoin. 18M bitcoins it $18T, just 5% of global wealth in 2021 when wealth will grow to at least $335T. With millininals moving into power and the economy moving to the internet, 5% is within reach.

It's based on the historic price of BTC over time using regression analysis. The 3 and .4 numbers are based on calculations under regression analysis. Read more about how regression is used and the formulas.

Yes. I track daily Bitcoin prices since 2010. Look at bitcoin highs during every 4-yr having period.  During this having period 2016-2020 $19k+
During previous having period 2012-2016 $1.2k+
During first period 2009-2012 $29+
It's following a logarithmic chart. 
Then next having period (2020-2024) will see a 6 digit high ($100,000+) in late 2021. 
Followed by 7 digit high ($1,000,000+) in 2024-2028.

You talk about coinbase. I do not need coinbase. I am not going to read those links about coinbase. If you know about. I want to see you explain in layman terms, what the issue(s) are.  As a retired College Professor, you have to explain your side. Not rely on others.

When you have no facts, you curse. Your text proves my point. I heard the same cursing in 1995, when I said the future was the coming digital economy.

I did not say I didn't reach it. Nor what my goals are for wealth creation. $10M, $100M or $1B. 
I have been talking about bitcoins in the classroom since 2013.
Most my wealth comes from real estate. I have been buying income property since I was 24 in 1980. I buy distressed properties with no money down. Its one of the college classes I taught. 
I found bitcoins as a way to diversify my wealth and discovered a way to merge bitcoins and real estate.
That correlation (losing and cursing) comes from my high school debate team in which losers always devolve into cursing when they know they have lost the debate. The winner does not gloat. Just smile and move on.
Over then past 45 years, I saw it in business and  in public. It works well in real estate as a negotiation tactic.
Do not get angry .... learn. Winner learn and adapt.

I taught bitcoin in my college class in 2013. I had a student who owned bitcoinsns then. Now at 25 he is a multi - millionaire. He has a blockchain consulting firm.

Regression analysis uses historic data to estimate the future. It creates that "best fit". The R2 of 95% indicates that the relationship between the available stock of BTC (inventory available) vs the BTC being created has a strong relationship to the BTC $. So you can project a future BTC price base on the future stock/flow (which van be estimated.-thus known).

If they are facts, explain them in your own words. If you do not care why are sending links? I am not rejecting facts or thruth. I am rejecting your links. That is the easy way out. This is not high school.
 Prove your opinion in your own words, I can prove mine via text ( no links needed) or go watch the game.
" I do not care" is a lazy way out.

If your issue is with coinbase, then suggest an alternative. Or are you saying bitcoin in bad and/or blockchain in bad? 
I have alternatives, I was suggesting to the post author how to start buying. 
What is you altetnative? Provide a solution to the public.

Buying for intergenerational wealth. I am 62. Buying for children and grandchildren.  Each 4-yr having cycle, value grows 10x. Next top 2 yrs from now. Then 6 years.
Then use bitcoins as collateral for low interest loans to buy distressed real estate cash. Once purchased, refinance real estate, pull out cash to repay loan and then left with income producing real estate. Will start in Jan 2026 with Bitcoin over $1M.

Cash App or Robinhood. I started with both. Now after I year, moved to Coinbase. In 2020, moving to cold wallet. Just a learning curve.

I have an account at 3 major banks and linked all to coinbase. I used zelle to move money among the banks. Then move money into coinbase from all three. Once bitcoins are purchased. I move my coins to a cold wallet.
