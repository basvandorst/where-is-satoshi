What do you think about Bitbank?

I bought in at 9,800 and was upset about that mindset. If you keep that "I can't buy at ATH" mindset you might miss potential real world benefits. The Hodl memes are great and all but imo handling real world things are more important (paying off short term loan debt etc)

I'm for paying taxes, but don't for a moment purport these people in government are actually using these appropriations for the roads and infrastructure we actually need. Look at CA in particular to see how those last several gas tax and vehicle registration taxes fixed "the roads". Same thing happens federally.

How is this impossible? Aren't there many viruses etc. hackers can use to inject their own addresses in once you ctrl+v something?
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:01:07
So that replacing the address attack, how does that work? How do I prevent that? Does it "inject" itself before I push ctrl-v?

What history? As a new investor in LTC and ETH, I feel like BTC is extremely expensive. I'm kicking myself for not getting in earlier, but purchasing 5% of one coin hardly seems like i'd be gaining anything.

What is the difference between a recovery seed and a passphrase. There are several different terms used for these things and it is a bit confusing.

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment technique of buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule, regardless of the share price. The investor purchases more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.

Thank you for your reply. I just bought the Ledger Nano S. 
What are some other tips or maybe some setup advice you can give?

Wait what the heck, so basically, there is no way to know if a website while loading has had the address changed? I'm assuming this is a "man in the middle" attack? 
I guess I just dont get how we can leave it at "nothing we can do". What do you do when you're transferring funds? 
Thanks for answering
