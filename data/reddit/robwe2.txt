Yes this is possible
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:23:31
IMO this is only possible if you have your coins on an exchange. You can take a look at crypto hopper.
Try it out first with a few bucks before you let them play with the rest of it. Use this at your own risk offcource
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:30:44
Agree. TA keeps some people of the streets.. just gamblers
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:43:56
If you deposit money it wil go into your fiat wallet. If you are inexperienced, leave it there. Otherwise you can transfer it to Coinbase pro and trade
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:36:08
Probably now haha
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:46:13
@_date: 2018-08-06 06:45:13
No it’s not. If we want btc to adopt we don’t need this!

New account new FUD
@_date: 2018-08-05 19:25:35
FUD! 
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:02:55
Don’t buy! Scam al over it
@_date: 2018-08-11 08:32:42
It has scam written all over it!
@_date: 2018-08-20 06:23:15
Which app? If you mean the coinbase app, je have to sell them for fiat first. After that you can wire transfer your money to your bank account

@_date: 2018-08-11 18:14:01
Gdax is no more! Maybe something went wrong converting to coinbase pro?
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:16:19
You may deduct it from the total amount 
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:15:17
Gdax is no more

Weliswaar voor te hoge prijzen maar toch!

I need a few ltc for personal use. I guarantee you won’t get it back
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:45:44
Still not enough 
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:13:17
Is there a private key?
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:01:18
No volume but price is going up!
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:24:19
I think this is fake

 Coinpot.co
@_date: 2018-08-06 06:47:05
I have the same with LTC now ��
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:47:31
Gdax, no fees on limit orders
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:12:39
Could have, should have, would have....
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:41:25
Hell yeah!!
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:10:25
don’t pay, restore backup
@_date: 2019-03-16 10:48:44
Same here, I have no clue why everybody is so against Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:41:07
I you can miss the money, leave it. Explain to her you lose money if you sell now.
Give it a few months... 
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:49:09
Because no one knows.. that’s why you’re wrong.
Putting a few lines on a chart doesn’t make you a great ta
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:17:47
Go to pro.coinbase.com and login with your coinbase account
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:53:15
I sincerely hope this will not happen!
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:23:45
Sold to. Trying to buy back in lower
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:26:37
Yes, click deposit, choose the currency an then click coinbase account
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:31:35
Grammar is fine. Let’s hope for the best ( I’m an LTC holder)
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:38:08
Abra is an option
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:22:07
Hmm, need quick fiat? You do realize the price is dipping and we are in a �� market?
If you buy, buy for the long term. Let’s see what is brings at the end of the year!
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:49:21
Didn’t say you were an idiot, we’ll see how far it dips
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:10:54
At he moment we still live in a fiat world. It’s becoming more accepted but in the meantime I’ll exchange it for fiat once it had a acceptable value 
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:03:36
Are you buying?
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:20:29
I think it works a bit better then gdax. I use it only for buying and selling at market orders when I need quick action. 
If you really want to trade, pick a computer. 
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:34:54
Offline storage is indeed preferable. In theory, every thing that’s online can be hacked. 
In my opinion, coinbase is pretty safe. Do not forget to set 2 factor authentication!
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:00:20
Buying has no use when the price keeps dipping.... 
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:58:54
Use coinbase pro
@_date: 2019-08-14 05:27:19
 No no, his mom did ��
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:48:15
Nope, it was my fault. I just bought some @ ‘ the bottom’
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:16:31
Personally it was becoming very hard to hodl. I bought Ltc on an average of € 180. Yesterday the price fell from 83 to 70 and btc was around 5.9. At this point I wanted te sell because of fear. 
I went to sleep and woke up the other morning finding out it rises again.
The problem lies in the fact I check the price a lot daily. Maybe the forget option is on the table (accept my private key)!
Bottom line, I’m not selling 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:40:38
Same here, timing sucks, just bought so we’re even ��
@_date: 2018-06-02 06:07:43
Nooo! I should go way up!
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:05:27
How does one ‘predict’ such unstable and manipulative market? What upcoming events are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:17:45
What caused it ?
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:21:44
No, coinbase pro has a mobile responsive website. I use it to for selling and purchasing 
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:24:04
 I know but it is still fucked up to see your money decrease in value
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:43:48
We all do....
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:44:21
Yes, still free. I’ve sent several coins to it now 
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:01:30
I’m back where is started....
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:14:50
I hope so but I doubt it. We have been in a long down trend from ath
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:29:10
Yes, if you are a beginner, CB is a good start.
After you purchase some coins you can later on send them to a paper wallet or trezor for instance.
You can also download Coinbase wallet to store of leave them om coinbase.
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:47:43
Let’s hope so, been bearish enough now?!!
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:30:24
Why a key feature? Your order is open, does I matter for how long?
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:43:31
Why? Mobile site is perfect 
@_date: 2019-08-11 09:39:06
Right on the spot!
@_date: 2019-08-31 09:05:29
Kraken is a good one as well
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:59:33
I hope you are right. Yet to see
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:40:09
Traded on the way down AND bought.
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:11:12
@_date: 2019-08-09 09:18:42
And it did
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:28:09
You can create a wallet and then what? You need to transfer coins to it and that happens online.
Chance of 2 wallets being the same is very small
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:22:26
sorry for your loss. It looks like you got scammed 
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:50:57
I really don’t get it. Doesn’t everybody want the price to go up? Fucking ��/ fud 
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:40:10
No because some people lost their private key
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:17:52
What the hell happend thuis time?
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:49:51
If you’re asleep how can you respond ��
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:02:16
If we all add up, the price would be 10k + again!
@_date: 2019-06-15 10:44:21
I second that. After an order had been filled (market or limit) the amount will be directly shown in your balance on top of the screen (mobile view)
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:46:59
I bought again!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:05:22
Gained on LTC. I’m in it for the potential profit
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:07:54
I just did the other way around. All in LTC
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:36:18
If you are being paid in bitcoin, you can choose deposit in Coinbase. The address then shown is your bitcoin address at Coinbase. Send the bitcoin to that adres.
After you’ve been verified and you added an bank account you can choose to sell your BTC and withdraw it, or let is sit there for a while
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:40:28
I sold @ €11.885,00
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:47:17
Gdax is no more. It’s Coinbase pro now
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:25:47
And it’s gone
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:20:19
Damn crypto
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:32:03
I think the best way is to sign up with Coinbase
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:21:56
I can’t imagine this rule even exists. It would be absurd

It’s not April yet ��
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:42:22
You can also use it legally!
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:53:39
You can import the private key @ skycoin after you died. You can spend your coins in purgatory

@_date: 2019-09-16 13:41:02
No begging

Use Coinbase pro

WOW! Here in the Netherlands we pay € 2,30 for a .22 liter beer! On pizza Tuesday all pizzas are €7 ( local deal)

That explain a lot....... cockroach water
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:37:48
Why is the irs a big problem regarding coinbase? In the Netherlands we we can have 50k without paying additional taxes. Is this different in the USA?
@_date: 2018-07-04 13:29:36
You can’t, how would one do that?
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:19:05
It does not explain why we went down from 8.4k to 7.7k
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:53:01
One thing is for sure, it will go up or down ��
@_date: 2018-04-07 07:27:32
You can’t, if you buy, it will go up or down!

@_date: 2018-04-19 06:55:13
Indeed the verification process could be much easier but on the other hand, it is a financial institution. So paying with crypto is like paying with fiat. Government requires ID.

Futures is speculation. Speculation is bad for the market because of manipulation which is unfair and drives the value in a direction of the one with the most money
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:56:10
But it doesn’t stay above 9k
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:00:09
