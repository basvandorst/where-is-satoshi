What kind of business operator, with an IQ over 75, ties up 50,000 of their capital for god-knows-how-long just to prove to a customer they are solvent?
What kind of rational business owner would think it's a good idea to tie up a large chunk of their business capital in one of the most volatile currencies there is (again, for no reason other than a customer asking them to)? What kind if customer would ask a supplier, whose solvency they are worried about, to take $50,000 out of their budget and not touch it during the duration of their relationship, when there is a chance that this act alone could cause the supplier to become insolvent? 
Everything about this post is completely ridiculous and utterly insane from a business standpoint. Next time you decide to write a fairy tale with a pro-bitcoin message, at least try to make it somewhat believable.

There's a difference between getting educated on a subject and getting a degree- I never claimed that they offered college credit, nor have I seen Khan Academy make that claim.  As I stated, I am already a college student, but I use their videos as an aid in conjunction with my coursework. 
The free KA app that I use has literally hundreds of videos, with many of their series covering an entire semester's worth of lessons. Their advanced algebra series, for example, completely mirrored the entire lesson plan/textbook that I used in that class, starting with polynomials and concluding with quantum equations. I completed that course at my college, having used the KA videos as a study tool all semester, and I was never asked by KA to pay anything. 
I am not going to argue about this any further- my experience with KA has been positive and I have never been scammed or even asked by them to pay anything.

They are a registered non-profit that allows anyone to obtain a college-level education, by providing completely free online courses in a wide range of subjects. As a student myself, I have used their site many times and have actually found many of their math video series to be more helpful than some of my classes.  There are no costs involved and they are definitely not a scam.

Of course not. There are no scammers on Paxful- just legitimate, normal people. As posted 2 days ago in his seller recruitment thread:
