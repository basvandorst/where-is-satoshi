Hold my bitcoin ...
@_date: 2018-09-29 15:22:36
If the btc would go down to 2$ you wouldn't buy it. Stop lying to yourself. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:22:19
I have to agree with you. Let's be precise and say "the first widely used world wide currency."
As of today the use of Bitcoin is either rare or complicated. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:24:45
Absolutely right. Gonna buy 2 of these.
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:39:17
"at some point we might be back up!" 
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:11:05
The herd is only following the fud/fomo. They will be buying again when fomo will hit mainstream media, they will sell again when fud will be all over the place. You don't need everyone on earth to make it successful (well, depends on your pov obviously, I like to think that crypto is the ultimate tool for financial inclusion)

@_date: 2019-03-20 16:46:03
N'arrête jamais.
T'es le Banksy de la crypto. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:23:14
At some point.
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:03:17
You should be fine.

Could anyone send this guy a shit load of empty priv keys? 
@_date: 2018-10-01 07:51:47
Network fees dude !
@_date: 2019-11-16 07:30:21
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:07:56
Us? I mean I bought, I guess you did, and probably a lot of people reading this.
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:22:56
Bull run 2012-2017?
I guess you have selective memory my friend. You include 2 massive crash in this time frame.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:39:25
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:22:11
You said it all. Buying confidently because I'm sure I'll  be able to use those btc someday. And hopefully they will be worth a bit more than today. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:25:11
Or even an island ! You can buy an island with 221 mil.
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:48:28
Please do
@_date: 2019-02-11 12:18:56
Wait... You still have fiat? 
@_date: 2019-12-31 07:01:55
So are you telling that if Oil would be considered to have its production cut by half in 1 year from now, being public information price won't move?
You either don't understand the basics of demand of supply, or just want to play the badass and give some nice short quotes to show how clever you are.
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:20:24
But can you live in a dollar?
@_date: 2019-04-14 09:20:44
I don't even think they do, but when your bags are THAT heavy, then you have no other choice but to convince people your bag is worth it.
@_date: 2019-04-01 13:32:33
What ? Who said so ?
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:21:18
How are these posts getting upvotes, when the entire comments are trashing it?
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:54:46
If you are buying millions you go to an OTC broker. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 12:03:17
Can't wait.

It is in theory possible to find the same private key twice by generating random numbers. But in reality this is so very unlikely that you might very well die of old age before you succeed.
Try rolling the slot machine, and report back if you get something !
@_date: 2019-01-24 19:13:28
Il not familiar with physic. I'll try and report back.

You shouldn't rely on memory too much.
What happens if you have an accident that affect your memory?

Don't be sorry. If you are dumb enough to store 11 btc on a website then you are not worth shit. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:46:21
If you can afford a $3m house, you can afford to spend the amount to buy bitcoins for whatever price that is, and do the transaction.
What the fuck is going on with the "give up his bitcoin", it's a currency to begin with, not a speculation vehicule.
@_date: 2018-07-15 09:57:45
Is there by any chance the transaction that we could look at? 
@_date: 2019-09-22 06:37:28
He's from 4 days in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:03:12
Well if you think that you should sell and attempt to buy at a better price. Or then you are just saying things that you don't believe. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:35:32
Survey suggests 80% of British people believe Crypto use will not happen.
There, fixed your article. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:51:23
EOS isn't decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:42:39
You should sell then. Go ahead. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 08:24:45
That's about 2 days of bitcoin mining, so not really. 5000 BTC isn't THAT much when it's being sold over the span of a few months.
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:44:04
I know the story, do you have any list of address? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:56:08
So you come to the same conclusion : we know he mined, we even know how much he mined with this computer, but no one has ever made a list of those addresses . 
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:55:15
While it has been "proven" that satoshi mined a lot of coin, all the rest is pure speculation.
No one can link an actual adress with satoshi's coin in it... 
There is no "1 million BTC" adress stamped with Satoshi's name on it,
