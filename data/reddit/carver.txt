Same problem here. I can't withdraw any coin at all. Emailed support yesterday with no response.

If mtgox didn't teach exchanges and consumers that lesson, then it's hard to imagine that this theft will.

Wouldn't we have warning that an attack was underway? In order to double spend, a pool that previously had 51% hash power would stop contributing anything to the chain that all other pools are building on,  while it tries to build a longer attack chain.

An excellent theory to assess how much to invest is the [Kelly Criterion](  You put in estimated gains &amp; losses, and it spits out a percent of assets to invest.

For anyone else who didn't follow B = 1 / P at first...
I'm used to thinking of p*q with units ( dollars per good * goods per year ), where good is some placeholder item like a laptop. The poster was using units that I think of like three variables: ( bitcoin per dollar * dollar per good * good per year ). The last two variables combine to the annual economy denominated in dollars, and the first is the inverted price of one bitcoin.

The USD denominated one is even more relevant IMHO.
