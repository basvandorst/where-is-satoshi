What an odd way to list locations on an international forum.  I assume these are in the USA?

Irrelevant to this discussion.

Odd, the machines here are updating every few seconds.
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:18:25
Ya, that's great....I'm just referring to your post title....it makes zero sense to those outside of those locations.
Also, we have 1.6% machines here in Vancouver, Canada.

That's because for every slice I eat I get a beer.
Suck it.

I presented a plan to my biz partners to buy in at $3 and was severely shutdown.  
$1000 each x 6    &lt;—— no go
I bought in at $3 and sold at $21 attaining hero status (for a short while).

You get shares?

Well, if you're going to Exit Scam, this is how you do it.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:48:28
Not the same.

This AM?  This has been going on for most of 2018.

Can get in to the two and three cent range in Quebec, Newfoundland and Washington State.

Sure, but give them $50 or $100 minimum.   $10 is a joke.

I was on holidays and I had to change my credit card due to fraud.
Paypal recurring tried to pay out and couldn't use the credit card, so it went to next payment method...a bank account rarely used nowadays. Not enough money to cover the payment it went NSF; $45 fee.  Over the next week Paypal attempted the same 3 times.  
Returned from holidays to a -$150 balance to pay.

Sure, but seems OP lives in northeast USA.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:31:43
Judging by the upvotes, I’m not a joke. Good luck.

About USD10.50.  Kinda insulting.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:32:18
You missed the point of the “gift”.

How the hell does Shakepay function?!!  That’s all Interac transfer to their Canadian bank account.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:26:58
Ya, support is insane!
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:47:42
Weird...it is literally the ONLY payment for my friend’s online edibles store.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:25:31
I see what you’re saying. ��

Could easily ship a bag of rocks though.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:26:25
BTW, when they ship up to the far north thy DO ship rocks with the order, otherwise gets stolen in the postal system up there.

The APP disappeared in the Canadian iOS store a few months back.  Makes sense.
