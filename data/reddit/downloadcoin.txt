We have received several requests for an automated withdrawal process and it's going to be added to the site soon.
Edit: Withdrawals are now automatic! Once your balance reaches 0.01 BTC it's scheduled to be withdrawn within 10 minutes.

Issue fixed.

1. It's intended that it's not too hard to brute force all the different files at the moment. When we add the store it wouldn't be hard to throw a random key on files that don't appear on the store to prevent brute forcing hidden files.
2. Will work on getting this added.

1. A link to the file is emailed. The files are only accessible with a randomly generated key which lasts for 30 days.
2. At the moment it's possible for somebody to pay once and post the link for others. If we change this it's going to have to be optional. There are some situations where somebody may want to download a file more than once or from multiple locations, so we have to be careful with this.
Also thank you for some content for the F.A.Q being built :)

Hi everybody, I'm proud to announce that DownloadCoin Beta has just launched.
**What is DownloadCoin?**
Our aim is to make it extremely easy for people to sell digital content online for Bitcoin. Just fill in your address, set the price, and upload the file. Every visitor to your download link is assigned a unique Bitcoin address to send their payment, when the server detects that the payment has been received a unique key is created for that user that gives them access to the file for 30 days.
**Optional email feature**
The original plan was to rely solely upon the redirection script to give users access to the file, however there are some situations where this is not possible such as a users with javascript disabled. For this reason we added the option to have the file emailed to you. We don't share your email address with anybody else and it's deleted from our system after 30 days.
**Who can benefit from this?**
Here are a few of the possibilities:
* Ebook authors
* Web designers selling templates on forums
* Indie music producers
* Software developers
**Do not use us as a wallet service!**
We put a lot of effort into maintaining the security of the site, but it's not intended to be used as a wallet. Please withdraw funds from your account frequently.
Please note that funds are not instantly added to your account when somebody pays, they are added once the transaction has reached 6 confirmations.
**How to withdraw**
Simply visit [ and type in the Bitcoin address you associated with the files you have uploaded. When you have a balance of at least 0.01 BTC the option appears to withdraw the funds to the address.
**Example download link**
