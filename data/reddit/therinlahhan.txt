Bitcoin has a long way to go, but .25T is about 30% of Apple's market cap. And when Apple moves, the whole stock market moves.
When and if Bitcoin can eclipse Apple, it becomes a staple part of trading strategy at most major funds. If you are a buy-and-hold investor who is already in, which I assume you are if you're on this sub, that's what you want to happen.
It sucks for people who haven't bought in yet, or people who want to trade Bitcoin like FOREX or futures, but not for investors. Having an asset that they own gey adopted by major players is the best thing to happen for an investor.

Hate to break it to you, but Wall Street people have been buying for months. O agree that this meteoric rise is concerning, but now Bitcoin is legitimately being discussed on the financial news circuit as an investment, not just some niche hairbrained gambling device for the Russians and North Koreans. At some point there will be a big correction, and it could even be today, but when it finally hits the $50,000 mark or so, it will start being concerned a speculative growth investment for traditional hedge funds and high risk mutual funds. At that point it will stabilise like a stock.
