I'm getting tired of hearing this. How has the US declared war on crypto?
Some congressional hearings later and lo and behold we find government neutral towards bitcoin or positive towards and just concerned with consumer protection.
Where is the damn declaration of fucking war you melodramatic children?
Unless you count the IRS sending out letters demanding people pay taxes on gains. Which is already widely known that you have to do and is not a crypto specific thing.
In which case fine. Taxation is theft, reeeeeee et all. But it's still not a targeting of crypto.0

If the pile of bodies around the Clinton Foundation are any indication, its less of a prediction and more of an observation of an uncomfortably plausible scenario.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:44:44
How? All you've got is commentary from higher levels of government. One President doesn't like it, but made no indication of supporting actual policy against it. The chairman of the federal reserve compared it to gold. And several congressmen approved of bitcoin while trashing libra.
No one has given any indication of trying to clamp down or restrict the BTC ecosystem.
All you really have then is the IRS letters, which is to be expected and has been widely emphasized in this sub and elsewhere to pay taxes on your gains.
Soooooo what fud?

Well my income is only a paltry 50k annual and I'll be getting a tax cut.
Didn't think Bitcoin would be full of people eager to strip others of their hard earned money.

Cool, so what? Everyone already knows the issue. Want to bring it up again? Or maybe go learn to code so you can help with lightning and segwit.

Im tired of people blaming "the system", a vague abstraction used by people too immature and ignorant too create a budget and make halfway decent life choices. At this point in my life ive seen to many of my peers make poor education choices, poor budgeting choices, and wretched spending decisions. It isn't the system. Its you.
If you dont want money sitting in an account burning up due to inflation then invest it and put it to work.

YOLO. If you like the company your at and will stay a while and you've got no debt, then get aggressive on BTC. It's a risky move but that's the advantage of being young, you can take more risks.

You can't price in the loss of 50% of supply.
@_date: 2019-11-07 23:06:50
People are looking at significant upside in the next 10 years, we are talking six figures. If you are going to buy and forget until you are hitting retirement age then now would be a good time to push money in.
Near term we are looking at a cut in supply next year. Usually price increases happen a couple of months before and after these events. So 2019 is a good idea to start doing the majority of your buying.
If you can handle the risk and are in a good spot in life, I would attempt to acquire atleast 1 btc before 2019 ends, then proceed to dca.

The greatest source of centralization is government regulation. Only large powerful corporations wield the legal resources necessary to comply with regulation. Example, the FTC targets primarily small and medium size businesses for monopolistic practices because they know they can beat them in court, while large corporations are rarely targeted because they have the resources to fight the government for years. That's without getting into the fact that government needs to recruit people who know the industry well enough to regulate it...so they recruit people who will favor the incumbents of that industry and are incentivized to hamstring competitors.
Copy right is important to liberty. It protects property.

If you have worked to create information then you have added value to it and it is yours.
@_date: 2019-11-20 12:11:02
Private monopolies are extremely rare occurrences unless you have a third party immune to negative feedback and unable to efficiently implement new knowledge, creating laws that ultimately favor industry incumbents.

All depends. If your young and dont have atleast 1? Sure. If you older and already have a good chunk of your met worth in BTC, 401k with matching is always a good move.

Dont give a fuck about my generation. Millenials are lazy, brain dead, short term, and amoral individuals. Only an entitled, stupid and naive little shit like a millenial could take 90k out on a loan and fart it out on getting a worthless degree while thousands of perfectly decent paying trade jobs go unfilled. The dumbasses can't even be bothered TOO save and invest, and it is my generation. I know my friends, and I hear the stories from others in my age group, if it isnt low wages from shit jobs (thanks to that shit degree), it's a baffling and frustrating inability to cull impulsiveness and save SOMETHING.
@_date: 2019-08-28 08:59:33
Hell is truth realized too late. Fuckers need to reset  and stop being dumb fucks, that fully automated gay space communism isnt going to save us. Maybe progressing back to the values and mindsets of the generation that survived the great depression is a better answer.

Why yes. People do still buy ownership of companies that produce actual products that actual people buy in the real world.

People are individuals first. Nothing is stopping millenials from grabbing a book and orienting themselves properly in life, even if that means going against society. Quite frankly, for a generation that not only has unlimited access to the internet but also seems to have a large number of "I'm ever so special AND ever so different" types prancing around its fucking sad.
@_date: 2019-12-29 02:05:23
Lol millenials. Pieces of shit who lack the moral courage to truly be individuals and embrace the coming trend of decentralization.
More likely, my generation will be the assholes who clamor for the safety of a centrally controlled economy, a centrally controlled financial system, and centrally controlled lives. Fuck em.

Shit jobs meant for teenagers are not supposed to get you by. Learn a trade, there's a shortage of fresh people. Probally because they are all stuck in the high school &gt; college &gt; office job track thinking that's all there is.

No mention of the tech in this post. Satoshi was working on this thing back when it was worth 0. You bitching because its trending at 7k, 10 years later, with the protocol proving it works for all ten of those years and having more tech piled onto it.
Yeah ok.

Dont be a retard, USA is rich because of it's infrastructure, resources, land, industry, tech, capital, and population. 
It could be south America, with all the resources in the world it needs to build a prosperous society but none of the cultural aptitude or functional government to do so.
But it isn't. Which is why the dollar will never go to zero and nethier will US bonds. You can't just deconstruct 150 years of progress that occurred on multiple levels. You would have to raze the entire US to the ground, people, everything in order for it to be completely worthless. You can hurt it, the monetary system could collapse, but the country itself is innately valuable.

Since when did political orientation significantly determine technological adoption? If you wanted to get into it for partisian point scoring, it's left wing ideologies in American politics that spawn anti tech factions, for example, radical environmentalists and anti vaxxers. Fact is, that was one of the arguments brought against Bitcoin mass adoption, the environmental costs. You could argue that conservatives have the Amish, but that hardly matters because the Amish as a community are not activists and don't try and force everyone else to goose step to their own tune.

Maybe your happy ass would like pay for the costs of a near open border policy, I sure did when I lived in Southern California. Of course the liberal northwesterners and progtard New Yorkers didn't have to pay for their under educated illegal pets. The beauty of federalism, I suppose. Decentralized consequences - for the fuck heads that never had to pay for their insipid ideas.

If you take your tinfoil hats off for a few minutes and take the (significant, I know) effort to skim the write up. You can see some heartening statements, such as the desire to let Bitcoin succeed or fail on its own merits by giving investors the choice. Another point she brought up that I found quite profound and have not seen mentioned before, is the antifragile nature of bitcoin as it relates to geopolitics.
 "...bitcoin mining is not geographically limited (except to the extent it migrates to places with cheap electricity), so it is not subject to geopolitical threats that plague other commodity markets.[25] Rather than considering the unique opportunity that these innovative characteristics of the bitcoin market present to investors, the order analyzes the ETPs through a legal and regulatory framework derived from prior approval orders for commodities with very different characteristics."

Are btc whales really that influential and coordinated? I'd appreciate an explanation, I'm not well versed in aspect of the crypto community.
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:05:55
Fuck, you are insufferable. That has to be the most arrogant condescending horseshit I've ever seen posted online, and all because you took a risk on cutting edge tech. Sit down and enjoy your gains or losses and let others decide for themselves. No need to get salty because the world doesn't share your opinion on new tech.
Also you should cull your misplaced glee. It's a safe bet that the wall street journal crowd makes a lot more than nickels beyond their paychecks. Traditional investments in companies that produce real shit with tangible value in the real world is still an entirely valid way of making money.

I listen to one of the YouTubers patreon censored. Articulate and well thought-out counter arguments to the progressive dominance in culture and media is not a hate speech. Its an argument that is winning. Hence the resorting to censorship and deplatforming. It's all you can do when you are losing the narrative.
