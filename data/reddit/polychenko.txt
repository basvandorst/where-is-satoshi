Nice slide yet
- some are very vague, unclear if blockchain actually resulting in a value-add
- many cases hard to know if blockchain best suited in each use case (i.e. Costs worth it vs trusted shared database)

Maidsafe isn't on the nice Crypto 2.0 google doc you linked. It's been in development for ~9 years, and has (or will have) a currency but no blockchain. Do you think that Maidsafe is a promising development?

I don't think the replies really defeat my point to be honest. NASA's funding peaked during the space race (so was it funding or competition?!), and private space investment promises to put rich people into space for a few minutes.  There is little private incentive for other non-profitable yet important areas. Clearly private competition is good for some contexts, but it's so clear cut in scientific pursuits or where there are longer-term goals (see the 'competitive' and private yet poor healthcare in the US vs european state solutions). We are after long-term success. No-one can observe the counter-factual but you can question which would be best. If you've swung libertarian you've swung too far imo -

competition or funding and management? If everything was private investment and competition the aims would be to put rich people into space for a few minutes and to fix male-pattern baldness and impotence. In some contexts surely fierce competition isn't all that helpful - in others clearly it is. I'm not sure about bitcoin long term

Is there any evidence to substantiate your claim or the counter-factual?

In the last year, it's reassuring that transaction volume has increased. Isn't there a trade-off between it's asset use and currency use? Surely the aim is to incentivize further bitcoin spending, rather than holding

"results suggest that increasing energy expenditure may be more effective for reducing body fat than caloric restriction" - so 2000 calories in doesn't equal a set amount of body weight gained, it depends on activity level. People eating 2000 calories of healthy food are likely to be engaged in activity more than those eating 2000 unhealthy calories, since diet and activity tend to cluster.

This is unhelpful black and white thinking imo. Comprimise: private communications allowed, but companies that support this should be accessable via a warrant. As in telephones, as in mail. Thus lawful process protected, and risk of terrorists communicating through end-to-end encrypted channels minimised
