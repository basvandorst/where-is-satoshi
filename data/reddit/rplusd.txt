I concur. You are just too stupid to know that their other languages out there in the world and not everyone has English as their first. But at list I speak other languages. I am sure you don't. As for the pizza you are the one making deliveries. You said it yourself. Forgot already? How about  **What time of your life you considered that life is unfair?**
Every. Waking. Moment.
Losers have this type of view on life.

The problem is my stupid bank not wanting to credit money to an exchange. Stupid banks.

You don't. Because you must be then more stupid than I am. As the questions was about Bitcoin ATM but your respond was about drugs. A smart person would of responded with an answer about the question not with a stupid line. Loser. This conversation has been terminated.

Go deliver your pizza. HAHAHAHHAHAHA

Very smart. With that attitude we are not going anywhere. I guess crypto then was truly invented for only the drug dealers. Have you heard that some banks refuse to send money to exchanges or you are too stupid to know that. You either help or shut up. Idiot.

Thats definitely a plus as the ATM does not require ID but to me the ID is not the problem its more the fee. I will see if someone can suggest something if not the ATM will be :).

You think so? You don't even know me. Not all parts of the world have all the convenience you maybe have. Move on and go back to your room. You are not helping here.
