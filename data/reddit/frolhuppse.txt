Doesn't the text on that site read like the definition of a Ponzi scheme? Pay some money now, and when more people pay money later, you get part of their payment. I cannot find any information of other ways they generate income than by receiving payment from new "investors".

Are you interested in storing actual value or just want some pretty coins?
To store value, you are better off with a paper wallet. See  or

I think the main reason is that the buyer cannot be sure the seller haven't copied the private key from the cold wallet. E.g. the seller can reclaim the bitcoins even after the cold wallet has been sold.
One way around this is using cold wallet manufactured by a trusted third party. For instance  produces wallets you can physically inspect and be reasonably sure no-one have copied the private key.

I think we also need to use bitcoins for other things than just "holding" them to convince more companies to accept them. And I still have enough bitcoins to be really happy when their value increases.

Nice! Here is a screenshot of their FAQ about this:

Does MtGox fall under a "Stock Company"?
"Article 440 A Stock Company shall give public notice of its balance sheet (or, for a Large Company, its balance sheet and profit and loss statement) without delay after the conclusion of the annual shareholders meeting pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Ordinance of the Ministry of Justice."

So, the modem firmware can read and write arbitrary files via a binary blob also included in CyanogenMod.

If you send the private key to Bit-card, you have to trust them not to keep it. Both you and they can potentially spend the money without removing the hologram. 
If you buy an encrypted card without a hologram, only you have access to the private key. But you cannot resell the card since the private key is known by you. 
The last case if you buy an encrypted card with a hologram. No one knows the private key until the hologram is removed. You can verify your passphrase has been used to generate the private key by checking the cfrm38 on the card. Thus you can send money to the card and resell it as long as the hologram is intact.

It is not there for me neither. I just sent them a question about this.

So far I used bitcoins to buy
* Humble Bundles (several)
* VPN service
* Christmas gifts from Target (via Gyft)
* Charity (several)
Some of the Humble Bundle purchases have required a few hours to confirm, but other than that it has worked very well. The christmas gifts from Target would be hard to buy without bitcoins since I wanted them shipped to the US, but dont have a US credit card.

You could always help making it more profitable to mine for the p2pool instead by donating to those miners.

This is exactly why you use the intermediate key instead of a raw BIP38 key. If you send the raw BIP38 key, you already know the private key to the card. Thus, if you give it as a gift, the receiver would need to trust you not to spend the value even after receiving the card.
If the intermediate key and a hologram had been used to conceal the BIP38 key, the receiver can be quite certain the private key is not known by anyone. As long as the hologram on the card is intact.

I am not verified, and I last traded less than two weeks ago. My understanding was that they only required verification for withdrawals and deposits.

"you must have an eBay account and PayPal account registered in the U.S. For security purposes, a credit card or bank account may be required." 
Unfortunately US only. But this is still huge. :-)

Whats the meaning of life?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:50:05
As far as I understand from [Skatteverkets webpage]( this is correct. And also that each trade is a taxable event, i.e. you need to pay tax if you trade at an exchange even if you don't withdraw your profits / losses.


(I am uneducated in this topic.)

Do you feel this is problem with Android Bitcoin Wallet, or with Bitcoin in general? I mainly use that client, and I have seen this delay a few times. Maybe the client could try to send the transaction to as many other peers as it can instead of just connecting to a few other peers?
@_date: 2013-09-08 11:01:52
You keep saying you need a thick client to do this, can you please elaborate the problem? As I see it you would still need a thick client to receive and verify the broadcasted transaction from the network. Or you simply print a qr-code to receive the payment and verify the transaction elsewhere?

Just tried it to refill my Flattr account. Worked like a charm :-)

I prefer the Bitcoin Wallet app. It is an actual bitcoin client and doesn't need you to trust a Web site with your private wallet key.
