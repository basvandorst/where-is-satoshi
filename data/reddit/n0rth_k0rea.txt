Tell me more about the etherdelta hack? I have some money there...
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:42:41
If you're in this to make money it's a pretty safe bet though, you must admit.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:17:56
And I just bought on the dip
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:51:16
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:53:12
Oh that's what I wanted - I knew 6800e was a high and wanted to trade temporarily for Euro then buy back in. But kraken fucking sucks so there was that. Then because I missed the dip i wanted I just bought in for another 200e. Now I'm down however much. Meh. It's the game, not gonna cry over it. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:39:35
I'm debating on selling before fork or hodling. Currently up €110, feel like selling pre fork and hoping for big dip. Not sure what's gonna happen :/
Congrats on the good return.

Lol, I'll be polite when they provide a service that works.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:44:01
I'm currently on 0.126... getting there :P

@_date: 2017-11-10 17:47:09
Fud or what?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:02:15
Is this true?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:32:51
I laughed from my butt ��
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:22:51
I've lost over 600e and have not been able to trade the past 48hrs with error after error. FUCK kraken. They are nothing but thieves and I guarantee you this is more sinister than technical problems.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:37:18
Hang on, so difficulty went up and price went up? Surely it should be the opposite, difficulty down and price up? Or am I just a total noob and missing the point completely.
In which case sorry but I've money tied up in btc at the moment and obviously feeling the fear. Especially with the amount of fucking fud going around.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:26:57
Nope just managed to finally sell my fucking trade and made 13e. WHOOPDIFUCKINGDOOOOOO!!!!! At least I didn't loose 600e. The cunts stole 500e profit from me though.
I'm withdrawing my funds and never dealing with fucken again. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:45:58
It is pretty obvious if you look at it - bch shooting up and btc falling. Even if you go to r/bitcoincash you see people switching coins now. It's really hard to stay calm in these situations, people are trading like headless chickens. I wanted to trade my Bitcoin at 6800 but kraken sucked all day yesterday and by the time I got around it had already dipped too much to justify it. Now bch shooting up? It looks daunting for anyone buying into original bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:46:43
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:26:33
I've tried over 500 times at this stage to try sell my bch. They're just not letting me. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:40:17
Fuck yeah
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:51:47
Fuck Bitcoin cash
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:03:30
Looked like a sun shade to me?
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:49:34
Yeah I'm pretty sure this was one of those als ice bucket challenges gone where the guy got killed. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:33:29
It's not showing up in my requests though, it never saved to requests even though I generated the address, I'm using the app - I can't see anything 
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:04:24
There's various editions of the Gallardo for example. You've got the basic Gallardo as your entry level. Then you've got special editions which are variants, like so:

CRISIS AVERTED - I received my Bitcoin. Sorry for the confusion. My 0.06xbt is now 0.08xbt. Namaste.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:07:53
And that's when I'll be buying my first full Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:26:12
Never thought of it like that. Wow.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:08:12
High mileage and poorly maintained probably - plus probably just base models. It's the limited editions you're looking to invest in.

Blockchain wallet app on android. Quick and simple.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:42:56
Have it written, transaction just got approved there, all is well :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:41:00
Oh man never mind it came through thanks be to God - fuck that had me worried, sorry I'm at work and it was a spur of the moment buy - just gonna keep hodling now... panic over
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:24:59
On the app you select receive, then it generates a receiving address, which you save the receive request and that address. I never saved the address before I sent Bitcoin to it, now it has disappeared from my exchange account... 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:35:18
I'm using the app - there's nothing showing in requests, just an empty request with a different address than I used. I still have the receiving address written down.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:42:33
It's all good they came through in the end - my heart! Thanks bro
