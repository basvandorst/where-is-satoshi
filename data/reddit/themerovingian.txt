Thanks - I wasn't aware that both existed.

Which is where it's such a good system. I do wonder about the alternative types of coins out there now though - are any of them designed anywhere near as well as Bitcoin? Will any of those take off? Bitcoin was the first, but that's not much of a guarantee that they're the best.

Well in the same way that all currencies not backed by gold are also imaginary: their value is entirely based on its market value, through supply and demand. There are some good theories about all that. If it were to happen that nobody cared about Bitcoins anymore, they'd be worth $0. Compare to Linden Dollars (Second Life), isn't that what happened?
I also want to point out that I do support the idea, because the people who developed Bitcoin clearly did their homework and knew exactly what they were doing when they started - they even understand the consequences of the predictable deflation that Bitcoin will suffer from. Because of their vision, I see a future with Bitcoin where with the alternative types of digital currencies, I'm not convinced yet.

GUIminer on an Intel i5 with an Nvidia 560 Ti. Windows 7. I only get about 85 Mhash/s, ATI cards are much faster for the same price than Nvidias from what I see. Mine was $220 when I bought the card.

You are correct, I trust cryptographic algorithms. But if 0 people care about (formula) = 1 BTC, then what good is it to have them? It is still based on trust: if you think my 1 BTC is worth a certain amount, I can use that trust you have to trade with you. If you don't care about my 1 BTC (exactly in the way that my neighbor wouldn't know what the heck it was), that 1 BTC is worth exactly the amount of dirt under his shoes.
The reason I got started with Bitcoin is because I read what the ideas behind it were, the limited and finite supply behind it are brilliant. The fact that they are aware of potential problems with deflation. The fact that transactions are anonymous if you want them to be. The fact that there is no government behind it. I love that part.
But in short: the more people believe it can work, the more stable and valuable they'll become. And I see that happening right now, with all the news coverage and what not.
