Thanks, seems obvious now!

This may sound defeatist (and it is I suppose), but I would say pick your battles wisely. A big generalisation, but teachers are less likely to give you the benefit of the doubt, especially if they have already been briefed about something. They have experience and seniority and believe they are well informed and that you are not. If you were to get expelled over talking about bitcoin then it could potentially have a huge negative impact on your life. When I was in school, one of the teachers had it out for me and I stubbornly refused to comply with her rules. I was sailing very close to the wind with threats of exclusion, but I gambled that as I was in the top 5% with a good record they wouldn't do it, and couldn't use anything else from my record against me. 
In hindsight, I still think that I did the right thing, however it took a lot of energy with arguing and my parents being called in and generally getting infuriated with the whole situation when I should have focused on work. I would recommend that you consider if it is really worth the energy to fight it to try and make a change in your school. If you really believe in it, then yes try to educate and change the minds of the staff, but accept that it will be an uphill struggle. However the most important lesson I learnt in school is that all that some people have is authority and seniority, they don't need to be right. If they are at the top, it doesn't matter that they are wrong, they can still enforce their misinformed opinions on everyone else.
It is frustrating because you are well informed and right, but ultimately at this point in your life, your education should be the most important thing to you, don't give it up to fight a battle that will happen anyway. I believe that media coverage and gradual expansion and widespread adoption will change most of naysayer's opinions eventually.

[He wrote that it will take him a year to repay the loan]( I think he needs to step away from Bitcoin, but if he does stop gambling he can get back to where he is now in around 2.5 years, so it's not too bad. If I'd lost that amount it would take me a lot longer to get back to where I was. 
Also I suspect even if he had won, he would have bet again eventually until he lost it all.

Pardon my ignorance, but what is a better way? I've only ever used managed shared hosting but haven't heard of any other ways.

From [here]( £745 per ounce of gold.
From the listing:


3000 x 745 = £2,235,000 = $3.75M per year
I think there are several possibilities here:
* The mine is depleted and there is nothing left
* The mine needs to employ such a high number of staff that it is no longer profitable
* Costs for a mining permit or bribes are too high that it is no longer profitable
* Over inflated production quantities
* Equipment may have been worth $1M new, but has since depreciated heavily and is only worth a small fraction of the original price.
I'd be interested to see the company accounts though.

Buy in with what you are comfortable to lose and never see again. Then leave it and wait. 
This is my strategy that I am following as I feel it is realistically the best. Faucets are not worth it. I bought a couple of ASIC USB miners to dabble a while ago for $80. At the time it would have bought me 0.5BTC IIRC. Since purchasing, I have mined 0.12BTC and I have stopped as it is not worth it due to the difficulty. I will break even in dollar terms if the price keeps rising, but I should have spent the money on BTC directly.

Or it could be someone external to gox who has put it there to slow down any investigation into who did it. There should only be a short list of ex employees that are possible candidates. Maybe this was added to frame someone?

Do these transactions go through quickly enough given how small they are? Or have transactions fees dropped since I last checked?
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:00:03
Ah of course, thanks.

Thanks, Done :)

Thanks for sharing this. I'm getting around 500 tests per second. It's tried 28 million combinations so far using this... No joy, and seemingly nobody else has got anywhere either.

To balance it out, here's what happened to me: I spent around $800 on 4BTC. Once it hit &gt;$800/BTC, my parents suggested I sold one BTC to recoup my initial investment. I said that I wasn't that desperate for the $800 and could afford to lose it and would let it all ride, and that I had higher hopes. They said fair enough and left me to it. They have got my best interests at heart ultimately, but they also realised I'm fully aware of the risks. Whilst I'd be pretty gutted to walk away with nothing, I don't have my life savings in it.
On the other hand, I also had coworkers who were constantly telling me to sell despite not buying any themselves. They didn't seem to listen no matter how many times I told them I was in it for the long run. I've got my scheme planned to gradually cash out as we cross different thresholds, if we make it there, that's when I'll sell. If not, no harm :)

So I've entered based on the odds to bet on the tournament winner for each match. I know nothing about football!

So you got that video made for $5? If so, it's really good value for money. I think a lot of the downvotes are because this doesn't feel like you are just another internet user who wants a company to accept bitcoin. 
Most of the time when people want a company to accept bitcoin, they just post an email address or link to a contact form. The fact that you have an official youtube channel and twitter channel for the campaign, and a professionally done video seems suspicious. When people there are movies being released and companies try to make it go viral, this is the sort of thing they do. If you compare it to the efforts to get amazon or similar accepting bitcoin they are nowhere near as well polished, and it seems though that you are making a lot of effort, and I've never heard of the company before.
Give the effort you are making, two explanations would be that either you sell shirts through the site and make money off it, or you are working for them to promote the website. If you make money through the site as a seller, fair enough then you should just be clear about it. If you had made a post saying "I sell shirts through this site and would like to get paid in bitcoin, they said if enough people email that they will implement it, here is a link", then people would be more likely to see it as fine and might help out. If you work for the company then it leaves a bad taste in the mouth and feels like we are being manipulated. It's happened before where it seems like a company plans to add bitcoin anyway and then posts here asking if they should, under the ruse that they need persuading to drum up publicity. I think you have put in too much effort and so it seems there is some incongruity between your amount of effort and the fact that you are just another consumer.
I think the ship has sailed on reddit for this campaign, if it's posted again I think people will remember it and link back to this. I've not voted either way as I've never heard of the company, but good luck :)

So what's the hash rate?
@_date: 2013-10-27 15:35:52
If you are in it for the long term, buy now and accept there may be some fluctuation and wait it out. How much are you looking to buy?
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:35:05
Suggestion: Have some charts and information about historic prices. All of the chart websites are lacking in one way or another (MtGox prices are always a bit off, and other places I have found have patchy data compared to USD rates, so even if you just published a table with exchange rate and time/date, it would be useful and interesting.
I was surprised by how high your limits are as I would have expected that most of it would be automated and so have minimal overheads.
Good luck, I'm glad to see another service pop up :)
