I'm new to this, so I'll keep asking questions: Have you done something else with your coins, other than buying and selling? Have you converted it into a 'peer to peer and decentralized offers'?

I was trying to apply the same scenarios you gave to my money in the bank to money on bitcoin. What makes it less fallible the system we have in place? And, it goes back into the original question in the sense that my money on the bank is part of a bigger system that includes money from larger corporations and billions of people, making it more "supervised", while bitcoin is still a bet for not so relevant companies - what powers of "self preservation" the "bitcoin system" has?

Thank you! I'll take the time to watch your video. But my first reaction to "why my bank won't fail" is "not because of me". Big banks keep money for big institutions, first as a storage place to it, and then as investments. Inês not in the interest of big money to let banks frio, so they won't
