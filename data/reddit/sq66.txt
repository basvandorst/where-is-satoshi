Have you heard about on-chain pruning? In short, ability to run full node with only UTXOs and a limited amount of blocks. Reduces required data storage about 95%. One possible design explained in further detail by @_date: 2016-08-18 05:28:05
I'm not apart of "these guys" and my point is to freak you out. However, you need to understand there are risks, for you to have an incentive to figure out how to protect yourself.


What you say seems at first to be intuitively true, but when you look into how many parties are involved it gets really difficult to ensure software is safe. It is not only the software they provide, but downloading it from the internet and finally your computer and all the software it already runs or even what software that might automatically update.
We will have better security in the future, I'm sure, but we live in the wild west of computer security right now.
It is far easier to create secure systems like the trezor, as it only runs one piece of software, and allows no automatic updates. I recommend reading up on hardware wallets, and consider testing one out. Even if you computer gets infected with a virus, your bitcoins stay safe.
No need to fall into despair.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:53:26
Do you approve that one should pay to _be allowed_ to provide better security? The whole thing sounds pretty backwards to me.
@_date: 2016-08-06 09:12:22
I was just picking on the unstated assumption that they do. *Iff* they believe it to be stolen funds, I agree.
@_date: 2016-08-14 06:25:11
IMHO, the comparison is not very good, as the Internet required a world wide *physical* infrastructure to be built in order for it to work.
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:35:08
It is not necessary to test it if we know how the consensus rules work. I got it answered in another thread. The new rules can be enforced with miner majority. It will become a hard fork only if majority hashing power rejects new rules and accept a transaction segwit does not allow.
@_date: 2016-08-06 07:39:34
Summoning how about a pdf version of your on-chain pruning proposal?
@_date: 2016-08-06 08:19:55
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:35:29
proposed on-chain pruning solution, to solve the problem: 
This solution does not require to download everything, while still allowing you to run a full node. You do have to have a "genesis-block" you trust. This is based on including UTXO-block hash into the chain, and keeping only a limited set of regular blocks.
@_date: 2016-08-14 06:31:29
Hardfork in disguise.
@_date: 2016-08-06 08:23:06
Stolen funds? Aren't you contradicting yourself?
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:37:16
See my comment to the parent (on-chain pruning).
@_date: 2016-08-18 05:05:18
Probably true, but that seems to leave us without a solution all together.
@_date: 2016-08-14 11:46:44
Can't you trigger a hard fork by spending a segwit "anyone can spend" transaction with keys not allowed by segwit?
@_date: 2016-08-18 07:29:29
I do agree to that. Even if it might be quite complicated there should be a step by step guide to use the software needed and form required trust relationships to ensure the software has not been tampered with.
@_date: 2016-04-22 16:48:25
Impressive indeed, but past performance does not imply future success :-p.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:57:53
Some people have been saying this for years, and when the market dominance of dropped from 85% to below 50% after blocks became full, the issue was clear. The solution is to make a fork with bigger blocks. Actually, that has already happened. Read up on the August 1st fork.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:16:44
"Shitting" on cen*sorshi*p is not name calling.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:46:39
Now to increase the segwit block size. No need to keep transactions on the real chain. Just receipts for the gol... I mean coins. Safe as a bank... I mean, wait a minute... No need to increase blocksize with hardfork? Isn't this like a backdoor implementation?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:18:14
Yes, it just seems you are mistaken. There no excessive name calling there. Actually there is more name calling over here, in my opinion.

Proposed step in solving the scalability issues Bitcoin faces among other things. Depending on your technical background there are many ways of explaining it. Here is one explanation:  but it requires you have significant understanding of how Bitcoin works in the first place. Don't hesitate to search or ask further questions.

Same goes for Bitcoin. Or?
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:59:21


Agreed, but miners choose what is spam and what not, by selecting transactions for inclusion. If you disagree your node will make a fork, and you will need miners to work on your fork to have it work. I don't want spam either, but it is non-trivial to identify. That said there are some ways of mitigating spam, i.e. by not including large amounts of free transactions and looking at coinage for instance.


This I don't understand. The miners can decide if a transaction is not paying enough and can set a limit or any chosen algorithm for including transactions.
Arguments for fees are usually based on the need to secure the chain long-term. However, there is a long way to go before transactions have to cover for securing the chain but we can play with the thought, and the price per transaction can be estimated by the amount of transactions that can fit in a block. I.e. if 12.5 BTC per block is enough to secure the chain (current block reward), then if we continuously have 2300 transactions per block (current peek) the fee per transactions would be ~0.005 BTC. If we can handle 10x transactions then ~0.0005 BTC fee per transaction would be enough to reach the same level of security given there would be 10x demand. Miners would then go belly up if they do not get enough fees, and when that happens there is competition among miners. If there is some miner accepting very cheap transactions the fees will not rise, and the weakest miners will not survive, but all the miners accepting dirty cheap transactions won't happen, because they have to get paid to survive.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:47:35
There should be ~0 after each new block, i.e. all transactions should be cleared, which are valid.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:50:23
Sharing the cost over more transactions won't work?

Science is based on evidence and facts, anyone drawing the argument of consensus need to think again. The corporation media will use anything that people care about against them, some things that was good and honest from the beginning can be completely turned around and used against you.

Please leave out ad hominem attacks. If you can't argue you point without personal attack, you need to figure out another way of explaining. In fact I agree with about most things stated here, in the sense that I too believe the "green agenda" has been hijacked. At least we should consider that possibility. However, we should put our beliefs aside and look at the arguments.
If your point is that the greenhouse effect is elementary science and therefore catastrophic man made climate change is true, wouldn't you agree that it is a severe oversimplification of reality.
Your "99.9% of climate scientists" argument is flawed because science is based on evidence and facts, not the opinions.

There is nothing magical about Bitcoin, but it certainly has many interesting features. Bitcoin is divisible to 100 million units called satoshis (after the group or person who published the software). Commonly used today is mBTC (milli-) and some are advocating the term *bits* for µBTC (micro-). Paying for a cup of coffee is therefore no problem, even if the value of 1 BTC would rise to a million USD.

Of course you do the math and know your margins, and it is understandable that further development needs income. I'm not suggesting you should lay down development, but instead grow your customer base. 
When we (this community) spread the word about Bitcoin there is a certain responsibility, and that feels better if the people we get on can use great security devices like the Trezor, instead of storing their coins on their phone or some online wallet.
If the Trezor cost 20€ I could easily have suggested to 20-30 people that likely would have bought it. 40€ maybe 10 people. For $119 i have got one in addition to my own.

I should really learn to follow up on my comments... a little late, but I guess the points are still valid.


I guess good enough ideas will find you eventually. I'm just out looking for them.


One less unknown factor, as supply of money is known.


Is the argument that you want central banking, as they have shown good results in creating stability? If you want n% inflation, that is actually possible with Bitcoin, if it is agreed upon. What feature of central banking do you prefer?


You can write simple programs within the blockchain, effectively enforcing rules on how a transaction can be completed; i.e. making escrow services, time locking, n-of-m signautres etc. (


You do not need permission from anyone. No registration etc. You can pay anyone without giving your credit card details, just like paying with cash. You can accept payment without an agreement to pay a third party for access.


My knowledge is based on verifiable things as far as possible. I'm a keen observer, may the chips fall where they may. If you can explain how my ideas falter, I will probably wake up. Do you subscribe to the same ideal?
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:21:46

I'm not advocating one or the other, but why is BIP101 suicidal? I know that there has been a long debate about this, but technically I do not understand why there should be a limit other than for limiting attacks. Wouldn't the miners would avoid mining bigger blocks than the network can hande regardless of the spam-limit? Otherwise they would risk being orphaned and loose the reward.

If bitcoin does not scale beyond 3 tx/s, isn't there a real risk of becoming worthless? I agree that decentralisation is priority, but I but I would argue that scaling is as well.
The key is to *scale while remaining decentralised.*
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:10:29
Max blocksize is still 32MB for BU, until another hardfork changes the wire-protocol. That gives us something to work with. Assuming worst case 32MB * 144 * 365 = ~1.6TiB / year (simply downloading data) or 450kbps. UTXO set growth from 2017-01-01 (1.56GiB) to 2017-02-28 (1.67GiB) UTXO set growth was ~56MB/month (statoshi.info). Extrapolating that we get from 1 to 32MB we get 21 GiB of storage / year.
Does not seems worrying to me.
Would you agree on the numbers?

Verifying the authenticity is "slightly" easier with bitcoin. Transferring ownership without physical transportation, "slight" difference.

You got me there.


I was considering that interpretation, but I honestly could not tell if there was some sarcasm blended in.




I completely agree. We should choose a path forward for bitcoin or risk getting marginalised. 
My initial comment to satoshicoin was simply to point out the over simplistic world view he was expressing. But now that we got that out of the way, I'd be interested in you view.
My arguments for on-chain scaling at this point are along the lines of keeping changes simple. As you might realise I'm not particularly fond of BU, but I agree that the one who runs the node should be in charge of the parameters of that particular node. The security model of bitcoin is not about centralised control of parameters.
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:17:27


Yes, understandably so, but referring to specific studies is much better that stating unsupported facts.
I read it up til their structural improvements proposals. Quite an interesting read. The main limitations they were talking about was the time of distribution of new blocks to 50, 75 and 90% of nodes. Sounds like a good metric, but miners, for which this is of importance, are probably in the first 10% to get the new blocks. I might be wrong about this, but even if it is the first 50% the result from this study showed 38 MB blocks would distribute well.
What do you think?
Also one of the contributors of this paper recently reminded that things have changed significantly to the better since this study was done ( 
@_date: 2016-01-14 08:03:17


I believe _that idea_ is the reason Bitcoin can make it in the first place. However in the end this is a matter of definition, whether we like it or not. The consensus rules make Bitcoin less vulnerable to hostile takeover (no single point to attack), but cannot enforce the definition people use of Bitcoin.
Shouldn't the Bitcoin definition include the genesis block?
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:46:02


I'm not sure why it is funny. Is there something I am missing?


I agree. We should not base our decisions about the future on scripture, but the best available facts.


True. We can praise his ingenuity and the vision he set forth, but going forward we are better off adhering to the scientific method and keeping a civil debate going and encourage discussion which is objective and constructive.
The great thing with the truth is that it has a natural tendency to be coherent, while falsehoods are harder to maintain in a coherent structure.

Ok. Which resources are the limiting factor?
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:55:13


Yes they do, but their blocks would not be mined upon by those who enforce the 1MB limit.


I don't see why they would.


Yes. And you would disagree?


No. I do not follow the logic on that. For me it is just opening one's eyes to the fact that the power does not lie with either the developer of the software nor with the miners by them selves. Reality is more complicated than that. "One should make everything as simple as possible, but not more simple than that.", which goes to say that oversimplifying the power structure will lead to making decisions based on something that is not in line with reality.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:12:30


Let me get this straight. Are you saying you believe that scaling is optional for the success of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:28:31


(I read you question with context as: Why do you think scaling is non-optional for bitcoin's success as a peer-to-peer cash system?)
Maybe my definition of success differs for yours? To be successful bitcoin should replace gold as a store of value, or replace fiat remittance payments globally, or become the world reserve currency.
Something at that scale would certainly be accepted as success in my book. I think bitcoin should grow as much as it can while remaining reasonably decentralized. It cannot, however, be fully distributed due to technical restrictions, but that is not necessarily needed. Decentralized to a certain (details omitted here for brevity) extent is enough. I also think bitcoin would be more resistant to attack if it had substantially larger user base and more wealth attached, not just number of full nodes.
What is your definition of success?


Yes, but only as a pet project compared to what it would be given reasonable scaling.


That's fine as you opinion, but I would prefer to scale.


I tend not to believe people, but sound arguments. Szabo's statement you referred to:


is not a convincing argument. In fact it is not an argument, it's an opinion.
PS. Don't give up trying to convince people, but find the arguments that are coherent and truthful, and spread them far and wide.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:59:14




Could you elaborate? In my understanding BU gives does not give miners any power they did not already have. BU gives an option to change the blocksize limit which is enforced per node. Isn't there also a technical 32MB hard limit that requires another hard fork?
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:50:22
Yes, you are right. I have not spoken to anyone who thinks scaling bitcoin is optional for it's success (as a peer-to-peer cash system).

@_date: 2017-03-26 22:27:53


Is that an argument? In that case my counter argument is Satoshi also said blockheight &gt; X =&gt; bigger limit


True, assuming miners will accept zero fee transactions. In that case malicious miner can also just mine garbage (fill blocks with self produced dust), no external adversary needed. But that kind of seems like shooting oneself in the foot to me.
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:29:36


Do you see this as a problem? For users just running a full node for keeping the network honest, this delay should not be a problem. Bigger players requiring fast payment verification etc it is probably not a problem to arrange fast connectivity or special arrangements like Falcon or FIBRE.
I will keep my eyes open for quality reasoning about this subject.


Greatly appreciated.

I don't buy your argument. By this logic we should reduce the block size to increase the incentive. How low would you go? Why accept more than one transaction at a time? That would really drive the transaction price up, but (as you might imagine) bitcoin would become completely useless.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:53:01


There will always be some people making false claims, but it works both ways. It is clear from the original white paper that it is the chain with the most work, not the longest chain by block count.

..and accused you of trolling. Nice going. Looking for solutions to the scaling problem? Me too. I kind of undersand the small blocks and fee pressure people, but I'm not satisfied with the result. "Blocks will always be full" argument is simply not true in the past, why would it be in the future?
I've been thinking about a pruning node which can remain a full node. By re-including unspent transactions from the beginning of the blockchain, we could maintain a fully verifiable state of the chain and let pruning nodes participate as full nodes. The only thing they would loose is the spent transactions archive, and the ability to verify the integrity of the dropped blocks. This would limit the storage space growth.

It proposes that the capacity of the network is more than 1MB transactions per block (~3000 transactions), and thus we should not try to collect the fee from just 3000 transactions, but something larger, which is undefined though. If we say 2MB i.e. about 6000 transactions, the fee per transaction might be half, but that is not ignoring the financing of the network security, as the fee per block is still the same depending on the pressure. If you prefer limiting the capacity of the network to increase security; we can go in the other direction. Why not limit the thing to 1 transaction per block, that would really secure the network wouldn't it?

You can broadcast transactions on both networks to split you coins safely to different accounts yourself, before sending them to someone else. If your transaction is replayed you just repeat the split operation until you get confirmations you expect.

My argument is that bitcoin is an abstract entity that can live beyond the core implementation without becoming an altcoin. And your counterargument is I'm twisting the definition?

This is what I have argued. Have you heard any arguments against this?
@_date: 2016-11-19 08:21:42


This is sidetracking. 




So we still don't know if it is supported by an "overwhelming majority"?


This segwit implementation is, among other things, marketed as a capacity increase. I interpret this as "attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol" (I know it does not change the main blockchain size directly).


I would agree that "barring attacks" are not related to the segregated witness idea, but to this specific implementation of it.


I'm not here promoting these other clients or methods used by their supporters, and as the moderation logs are not public, there is really no way for me to confirm either side.


As I argued segwit does attempt to alter the protocol without any objective measure of overwhelming consensus. It is my personal belief that rule  is used to enforce a political agenda, when it suits the moderators.

Ceiling or limit, just the same. You could just hard fork to 1 transaction per block if enough miners agreed that would be a good idea. 
Nice strawman there. The 21M limit does not have much in common with the 1MiB block size limit. If you don't understand that, you should read up about it, before making claims like:


You are completely clueless:




@_date: 2016-11-01 05:02:51


The other side is arguing the exact opposite, i.e. that att the changes could be done while reducing technical debt, when done as a hardfork.
If one finds exactly opposing arguments, there is usually an easy answer to why one is wrong. Any clues?


If 5% stay on the old branch out of lack of awareness in a hard fork, it would probably not be a problem, would it?
If 5% stay behind because they want to, that is their prerogative (of course if this 5% owns 5,000,000 bitcoins, that is a problem).
5% could also just change the PoW algorithm and break off, but that shouldn't be a problem?


While I understand the argumentation holds shortly after activation, I see a problem further down the line. If there is a "change of heart", this softfork can result in a hardfork if enough power break the new rules while conforming to the old ones.

There isn't a way to verify pruned version, as you cannot calculate the checksums on data you don't have. However, I've read a proposal (On-chain pruning) where you would add the UTXO set hash to blocks with certain intervals. That way you could download only the UTXO set, which is 1.5 GiB, and a limited number of blocks to achieve what you are asking for.
The proposal can be found here: 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:25:03
You are right, if you wish to use the old style malleable transaction type it is currently not proposed to be discontinued immediately [1].
Then again, you can never fix malleability for the old style transactions (because then it would not be the old style transaction), agreed, but my point remains valid that you can solve the issue transparently without introducing a completely new transaction API as SegWit does.

And it does. Still we don't want it to grow excessively. I.e. if we see a 100k BTC we don't want it use 10x Hongkong's energy. If a 100k BTC is reached after two halvings it would be 2.5x Hongkong's energy, not counting transaction fees.

True, true. In addition the 51% attack does not harm the chain in and of itself, other than possibly blocking transactions, and that would be very expensive to keep up for any longer period of time. That could even be worked around by quite simple changes i suppose. Deep reorgs might be quite devastating, but they can also be mitigated quite easily. Are there any other possible effects of 51% attacks that I'm missing?

To be honest, I don't know what is propaganda and what not anymore. You might be right, but I'm afraid I have that same feeling for BTC right now.

I know about segwit, there is no 2MB in there. An equivalent of ~1.7MB blocks is what i hear. That still needs some adoption to occur, none of which would be the case with a blocksize (legacy block) would be increased, which I was referring to.

BCH allows for around 26 tx/s (assuming a 500 byte transaction size). They are testing how much can actually work and where the bottlenecks are, be it bandwidth, disk space, software limitations or something else.
They have managed to achieve 256k tx/s right now in a specific test scenario, and that cannot be replicated in the real Bitcoin network just yet.
There are many ways to improve the performance without significant centralization, and as I have understood it, BCH proposes to kick the can down the road by a modest (choice of word is up for debate) blocksize increase to keep the fees low while better scaling solutions are developed.


This does not change the storage requirements, but has implications for block propagation time.

If there is no way of verifying the complete blockchain, i.e. the beginning of the current main chain is lost, a new client must have a way of setting a trusted starting point. The trusted starting would be a block's hash and a complete set of unspent outputs, which must be trusted to be real without being able to verify the authenticity.

Yes, but if a chain is not mined the transactions stop (or are very limited), and no buying or selling can occur, which inevitably leads me to think that an upgrade can be done with miner consensus to a certain point. If no economic support exists that chain will also die, but not immediately, but rather over a period of time. During this time the miners can flipflop to other chains if their equipment is compatible.

LN will prove itself in good time, or not. Choking the main chain to prematurely force the use of off-chain solutions is a bad decision according to some. 0-conf could be compared to closing a LN channel without waiting for confirmation. Still every 0-conf transaction is intended to be on-chain. That is not true for LN transactions. I don't by into this intellectually dishonest claim.
@_date: 2018-07-21 07:00:02


No not that sentence alone, but if you read on it is quite clear. 


"To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be
publicly announced and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received." ... "The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server." ... "Each node collects new transactions into a block." ... "Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work." ... (blockreward: "By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned
by the creator of the block") ... "Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash."
By this definition a transaction is only considered a valid bitcoin transaction when it is confirmed in a block and other nodes continue working on that chain.
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:33:17


We can agree to this.


0-conf bears the risk of not ever being on chain, and therefore not being a bitcoin transaction.
Can we can agree that by this definition LN transactions are not bitcoin transactions until a channel is closed and the closing transaction is included in a block?
I do, however, see the point of the "bcashers", that there is a difference between LN and 0-conf. LN transactions are controlled by channel owners, and 0-conf transactions are on the mercy of the miners. In effect 0-conf is one step closer to being on the chain than a LN transaction.

That a Bitcoin transaction is a transaction that is included in a block on the Bitcoin blockchain?


Then there is no guarantee that a LN channel will be closed either, until it is included in a block?
It is up to you to decide if you think the risk is small enough to accept 0-conf.


I quite firmly believe that bitcoin transaction are the transactions actually in the Bitcoin blockchain, and anything else is something else. Do you think other kinds of transactions can be bitcoin transactions? If so, how do you figure, or distinguish between the two?

Removing complexity while maintaining desired features is a protocol improvement, which is in direct inverse relation to amount of code. 


Why is that? 


If you are discussing game development, the new office suite and so forth, I would agree. When discussing critical security applications the less code you have the less potential bugs you have. A central feature of Bitcoin is security, not adding fancy animations and drag and drop image insertions.

I don't need to blame satoshi. The world looked very different back then, I would say he did a pretty good job predicting how things would turn out, but there is always a limit to how far you can predict. Now we need new predictions based on what the world looks like now.
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:27:40


Yes. And if you lose mining majority, you lose the power to enforce the soft fork rules, leaving you with the old rules.


No. Now you are just making things up.


Yes, but that was not what we were discussing. My statement reiterated is that in the case of segwit loosing hashing majority, it will hard fork off the main chain the instant a segwit rule is violated. All the "old" nodes will follow the hashing majority and accept spending the segwit outputs to anyone, no hard fork required.
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:16:22


No they are not. You have it utterly backwards. In that case segwit is hard forking away from the main chain, as segwit nodes don't accept spending segwit outputs to just anyone, but in the "old" world it's just "anyone-can-spend" transactions.


Dead wrong, so to speak. You will have to hardfork to uphold segwit rules.
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:19:27

What do you think I believe is acceptable?


It's a way to change the rules. If you need to update something, you need hard forking unless you want to live in fear of a hashing power majority sinking your soft fork rules. Softforks are an attack vector just as well.


You make a ton of weird assumptions, based on what? And then you ask how dense "we" are.
Would you care to enlighten me?
@_date: 2016-10-12 05:37:50
How about flexible transactions? 
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:20:35


Not at all. I'm referring to the current "hard rules". Segwit will not accept everything that is acceptable with current "hard rules" in the unupgraded clients. With "hard rules" I mean rules that are enforced in such a way that the client will blatantly disregard a block not confirming to these rules, i.e consensus rules. 


We are in complete agreement here, the difference being that what I explained is segwit nodes hard forking due to *its* new rules, which are not enforced by unupgraded nodes, i.e. the current "hard consensus".


This is the point I am making. It is not a *hard fork* from the current consensus rules, but the *new rules enforced by segwit nodes*.


You may wish that to be true, but you are not enforcing it with hard rules, which is the difference I'm trying to point out.


I completely agree. 
However, suppose the following hypothetical scenario. Activation is done using hashing power alone. Users cannot disagree when you go the soft fork route, unless they agree on a hard fork, which is significantly harder to orchestrate in a distributed environment. This will lead to the potential of the users not accepting segwit, and simply going along with the "attack" on segwit down the line. Segwit rules must then be enforced as a hard fork or the segwit transactions would be lost. When segwit rules are enforced in a *hashing minority* scenario, *it* will effectively be a hard fork. Here, i call the main chain the chain that has the most work and conforms with *current* consensus rules. In this scenario segwit will effectively be the "altcoin". Please feel free to correct my definitions if you find them to be incorrect.

No wonder you have a communication problem, when you make up your own ambiguous concepts, and assume others will understand you. If you mean people with bitcoins, why don't you say so. A node is usually referring to a bitcoin client application.
So your argument is that you need people with bitcoins enforcing segwit.
So how should we interpret some of your earlier comments in discussion?


You have a real issue with coherence.


Quite the speculation. Let's say that is a hypothesis. Fine, but do you have any evidence to support your hypothesis? You don't suppose I will take your word for it?

@_date: 2016-10-14 06:13:06
Thank you for your extensive reply.




Exactly right, except that was what I stated already; limit features ==  allows LESS. If I don't misread you, you do agree with me. In that case would you not agree that segwit in fact is a security exploit in itself. There is a security hole in bitcoin which allows to add new features and change the consensus rules, by soft forking.
From "Raising the 21 million BTC limit with a soft fork" [1] , I read:
"... the 21 million cap can be raised by a soft fork too; in fact, by the same general trick that will be used for the SegWit soft fork ..."
If this premise holds, we should disable features that enable segwit as a soft fork, by a hard fork, to restrict these known exploits. Or is there something here I don't comprehend?


You are right. What we can do is to change the difficulty of engaging in evil shit.




I do not subscribe to the idea that the complexity of the segwit implementation would be as complex, would the equivalent features be implemented as a hard fork.
Also, I would like the bitcoin implementation to fix the


I know that segwit is a soft fork implementation. I referred to the equivalent features implemented as a hard fork, i.e as discussed in flexible transactions.

@_date: 2016-10-27 19:02:38
I'm afraid you misunderstand my argument. My point is segwit will hard fork from current consensus rules if an attack of the described nature would occur. In that case segwit will effectively become a hard fork.

Then what is this "node majority" requirement you are talking about?


No one cares about "majority of nodes", if you can even define what that means.


Segwit will end up creating a hard fork, the old nodes don't care as both forks are valid to them.


You keep telling yourself that.

You're right! I did not realise that.
Anyway, why did you assume my view being: _"intended to change rapidly, through any means other than consensus"_?
@_date: 2016-10-12 06:06:24
I believe in keeping the Bitcoin consensus rules as simple as possible. Segwit is not keeping it as simple as possible. In fact it adds significant complexity which could be avoided by implementing something like flexible transaction instead [1]. If segwit is activated it legitimises introduction of unnecessary complexity (like additional block structure) and dangerous extensions (like new scripting languages), which I think should be avoided. I would prefer hard forking in rules to prevent such loopholes in the consensus rules. Finally I would conclude that I do think it is a downgrade based on the argumentation just presented.

Ad hominem. You must really feel you're contributing. 
You didn't even manage to refute my argument. If you loose the assumption that segwit will maintain majority hashing power, as I quite clearly suggested in my clarification:


the fork that do not enforce segwit rules will accept spending the segwit outputs. Given the possibility of majority hashing power on that fork, non-segwit nodes would be happy to follow, or where does this logic falter?
@_date: 2016-10-23 13:06:56
Sure does.
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:12:10
It may be a copy cat, but it sure is a lot cleaner. I don't like unnecessary complexity in the core implementation of bitcoin. It opens up security risks yet unknown. In my opinion segwit is just that, unnecessary complexity.
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:26:56


Why? They are valid in all nodes except segwit.




Segwit cannot accept the the attackers blocks, as it is invalid in segwit land. If the attacker can maintain hashing majority it will product the longest valid chain. It is certainly not forking. Segwit nodes cannot build on that chain, causing a fork, but not a hard fork then?


A continued enforcement of consensus rules, cannot to the best of my understanding, create a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-10-27 07:01:26
Does it really matter what *my* position is? You asked what possible reasons there are, and I gave you one. I'd rather debate the merits of the arguments, not the players.
@_date: 2016-10-12 16:43:02
There are all good points.


It would be nice to have a reference. 


Absolutely true, and this is part why I'd like to hard fork away from such loopholes instead of creating new ones. Sewgit introduces new possibilities for extensions, which are hard to predict how they can be exploited.


True indeed. However, the only true backwards compatibility that is required, to the best of my understanding, is the ability for owners of bitcoins access to their wealth, in addition to keeping the consensus rules where the consensus lies. That was a mouthful, but I guess you could make out what I was trying to say.


Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't it be possible to just update the bitcoin client, if the bitcoin client provided an backwards compatible API?


All you need is access to your private keys, which you should maintain or in the case of "bitcoin banks" / wallet providers, they are probably responsible for ensuring your access to your wealth.


I think I understand where you are going with this, but segwit does make all old bitcoin clients verify only a subset of the rules which apply. If segwit is activated, and someone mines a block signing all the segwit transactions to himself, all the old nodes would accept it without question, creating an involuntary hard fork. A well planned hard fork is a clear "end of the line"-sign. You may choose your lane, so to speak. Agreed all the clients that speak the bitcoin protocol would be incompatible, but not the ones speaking with a Bitcoin client, which may present a backwards compatible API.
@_date: 2016-10-27 12:51:23
does not understand the issue I described. He is talking about some new nodes making a hard fork into an "altcoin". Actually the problem explained is the exact opposite. Segwit will hard fork from the main chain, as it does not accept the "any-one-can-spend" transactions to actually be sent to anyone. But current rules do not prohibit that, only the soft fork rules in segwit do that.
Was this explanation any better?

It's difficult to see the cost, I agree, but as inflation becomes negligible (~3-5 halvings depending on market price) the cost of running bitcoin will become more tangible. In a closed loop system it's easier to see the cost, but as the ECB or FED, when they "print" money they steal value from the real market. I don't understand why this would be any different? 
@_date: 2016-10-12 05:46:42
You make it sound a little better than it actually is. If someone mines a block that spends all the segwit transactions, all the old nodes will accept is without question, creating a hard fork. Sewgit will then have to overrun the forked blockchain to enforce segwit rules.
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:47:50


One reason is that using a soft fork to introduce new features will be vulnerable to a hashing majority attack later on. I.e. if there is a large enough attack (say continuous for some days/weeks), and this attack steals all segwit "any-one-can-spend" outputs, then all segwit nodes will hard fork off the main chain, while unupgraded nodes will follow the chain with the most work.
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:43:13
This is pretty much what i figured. Well said. Now we would need someone to propose this to the Reddit(/Voat.co?) team as a new feature and test it out.
I'm working on a completely distributed platform for the web, but that implementation will still require a lot of work. At the moment we need something that can be done at short notice.
@_date: 2016-10-13 04:56:32


Wouldn't you agree that soft forks should only be able to limit features in bitcoin, not extend them? I believe the ability to soft fork in new features on the scale of segwit is a security risk.


And still you want to allow unnecessary complexity, brought by segwit, into the core implementation of bitcoin?

A bank has nowhere near the amount of money needed for everyone to withdraw their money. A run on the bank (or bank run) is when there is a sudden wave of people wanting their money out of a bank. The result is the bank going belly up, denying withdrawals, FED stepping in or other drastic measures. The explanation for all of this can be found by digging around for fractional reserve banking, or check one of these links to get started:

Your childish arrogance will not get you far. Typical of someone who has nothing to back the argument with.
I may be stupid, but _you are wrong_. You should really ask someone else if you don't believe me, but you don't need to hard fork away from a soft fork. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 05:27:34
People tend to get jumpy for that kind of thing, and it can be contagious. I think the issue at hand is that the Bitcoin community is interested in the monetary system at large. A single bank going belly up might just be the trigger for the financial collapse some are expecting. If you feel safe and don't want to speculate about potential problems on the horizon, that's up to you.
@_date: 2016-05-24 08:32:58
Sorry for the lengthy response, but I could help adding a few closer details and assumptions. Hope it's worth the read, though I'm not sure I was able to answer your questions.
You're right. It's not very clear. I assume the cost of mining will, to a significant extent, be funded by selling Bitcoins for other currencies, which I assume will be acquired via exchanges. This would lead to suppressing the Bitcoin price.  As only a fraction of Bitcoins are for sale in exchanges, this impacts the Bitcoin price even more than the theoretic inflation. If bitcoin is successful, products and services (read mining equipment and running expenses) can be exchanged for Bitcoins directly, which would lower the sell pressure due to expansion of the money supply. If we can measure the cost of running Bitcoin in Bitcoin, then we get a really interesting metric, namely overhead of Bitcoin itself, and the "true" cost. Following this point (hypothetically from my somewhat limited understanding of economics) the price of Bitcoin is going to follow the real assets and services measured in it. I.e. more real value measured in Bitcoin leads to a pressure to buy Bitcoin and vice versa. Of course no fiat currencies are fixed to something stable, which means that the Bitcoin / USD (fiat currency of choice) exchange rate can still be diluted. One of the great benefits of Bitcoin is that it cannot be diluted, or at least it is much harder to do if its market is large enough.
To get back to your initial question about existing or circulating money, my take would be that knowing the amount of existing money gives us improved predictability and potential for stability. The money that circulates within the economy should have a negligible impact on price, but adding or retracting real products and services from the market should impact the price. The inflation occurs only if the amount of real value decreases in relation to the supply of currency, assuming the newly created currency is used at the same rate as the already existing currency. The money that moves through exchanges set the price, but can be heavily manipulated and gambled upon at least for now.
