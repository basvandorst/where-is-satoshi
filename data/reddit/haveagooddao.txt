What I was thinking I'm not sure if it's been done or how it would work with the price fluctuations... But the idea would be.. paper wallets that you buy from shops that are like the size of a playing card and the private key would be covered in the stuff scratch lottery tickets are covered in and when people get them they just scratch off the stuff and swipe the privet key into they phone app....
Be fun to buy that. But you would need to make them without anyone ever seeing the private key and never keep the data or people would think you would eventually scam them if they hold it for a while 
( a saw a guy on lite coin selling physical coins with the qr code on it and people all got scammed once he swapped all the private keys he had kept since selling the coins) so don't do that
Or if your feeling putting some big money down would be a arcade that all the machines Bitcoin only 
We're I'm from you need to go and buy credit and they give you a card that you swipe on the machines to play anyways so it would be really easy to do. But if the players buy some Bitcoin and don't use all there money they can still go home without having to cash out... 
You could even just make arcade machines that accept Bitcoin and sell them to bars and other places
Or a physical Bitcoin casino or the same just a pokey that accepts Bitcoin and pays out in Bitcoin be pretty awesome 
Alright there some ideas 
Go do it let me know if you open that arcade I'd come from the other side of the world just to play there
