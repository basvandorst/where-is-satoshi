Money by definition is a mean of exchange elected by consensus of the people using it, and for a large part of its history it has been made of precious metals that are scarce by nature, So yes money in it's origin is a commodity and even the US dollar which the modern global monetary system is based on, was originally a certificate that you could use to retrieve your gold from a bank until after the 1929 crisis I believe when the gold standard was introduced that you no longer could claim gold for your notes, but governments were still obligated to keep a gold reserve equivalent to the value of money they print. It was only after Nixon nullified the Bretton woods system that money started becoming mere fiat instead of having real value.
TLDR: Money is, by its historical definition, a commodity, and the FIAT we have today is the biggest scam in human history. Maybe bitcoin doesn't have the intrinsic value that gold has, but it has a lot of other awesome features that can easily make it the next monetary system. We aren't there yet, but more people are introduced to crypto everyday, and the growth is exponential, and once we get to a point where it becomes usable and the price stabilizes then you'll see things priced in BTC instead of USD. Until then, speculate away.

I feel mBTC is more viable for the time being. 1 mBTC = 7.59$ at the time of this post.

Bought on discounts, or grey market stores

That's $20 .. Unless someone knows exactly how to solve this kind of puzzles, I doubt anyone would care.

Yes, but most people you see around have bought in late 2017 / 2018

But how can they seize it if they don't know your wallet address??

lol .. Aka BCH shill
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:18:07
My point is no one is supposed to know about the wallets you own. And even if they discover one, they wont be able to seize all of yiur crypto if you keep a couple of side wallets

I thought the guy in the red shirt was the bigger noob at first, when he started calling it "data mining". Little did I know.

What did I just read??
IF said ban is not based on any solid reasoning such as gold being harmful to its HODLers, then I don't understand how that can be considered a law?
And say, I don't agree to that law and wouldn't want to live there anymore, do you think I'd just be allowed to walk out with that gold? Or am I gonna be robbed because it belonged to that "ground" (for billions of years)? and would they even bother to verify if that was true or whether I brought it with me when I or my grandparents migrated to Murica the first time?

You're biased towards your own perspective and experience. Just because you have never met someone who's ok losing money, doesn't mean they don't exist.

This is the opposite side of the spectrum from "Old man yells at bitcoin" kind of news

There is already satoshis and mBTC, which is 1/1000 BTC

Well, this is where the big whales get their news from so we better hide FUD from them so they don't panic sell and tank the price even more.

I think it has to do with Lamborghini dealerships accepting bitcoins as a method of payment.

When CNBC tells you to buy, you better sell. Unless, they're playing some reverse psychology trick on us.

If you consider the halvings, energy consumption should be a lot less by the time BTC hits that price point
