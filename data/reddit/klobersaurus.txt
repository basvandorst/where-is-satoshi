What other secrets does she have, eh?

shhh the SEC will hear!

They used to make highly prized tape decks back in the 70's &amp; 80's

So you like fascists, then?   
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:23:27
Yeah im pretty sure people who hate fascism are also anti-violence. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:32:35
Wait what's wrong with being anti-fascist? Do people like fascists?
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:31:12
When have anti-fascists ever been violent? I mean, besides everyone who fought on the side of the allies in ww2, of course.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:37:58
i think you have that backwards. anti-facists are anti-facist (look it up, it's in the dictionary). it's really only facists that seem to be confused by this.
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:01:39
So anti-fascists are violent??
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:39:23
You do realize that you are an actual fascist, right?  
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:02:03
You know that's not really a thing, right?
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:41:05
which streets? who's looting where??
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:15:51
That dosen't seem right.
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:16:57
Oh. Those are protestors. Every country has them. In Texas, they play dress up and carry guns to fight imaginary people. Are those the ones you are afraid of, too?
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:28:35
What are you on about? I don't know of this meme.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:57:07


skinheads should get beat up. hateful homophobes should be doxxed. fascists certainly should be harassed.  would you like to defend any of those groups? do you consider yourself among them? if so, you are a terrible person and you deserve terrible things. 
sure, you have the right to be an asshole. you don't have the right to whine about it when the tables are turned. again, why do you feel that those groups are worth defending?
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:12:30
does this political group have a website? i'm 90% sure that there is no such thing and you've just been reading too much T_D.  you know they make things up just to get you angry, right?
