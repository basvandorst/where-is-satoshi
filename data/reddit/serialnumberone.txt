Not too dumb.
In general, in the usa, people are not taught the fundamentals of this.  The financial system in the usa is also set up to be complicated in such a way as to obfuscate the truths of what is really going on.
This is by design.

yes, also, one would need to add in the refining process of gold, imo

oh, of course.
How does one back such a thing up?
@_date: 2019-05-09 17:41:25
well played, sir
@_date: 2019-05-24 10:32:21
I am fully aware of this.

You are making a common and fundamental error assuming that people make decisions based on facts. People make decisions primarily based on how they feel. This is an evidence based statement, btw. Any research you might do on it will back up my assertion.
Even venture capitalists, most of the time, go by their gut. (they discuss this in the theranos documentary "out for blood", btw. great shit)
Now, if a lot of people liked how they *feel* when they think of warren buffet, he would be a better choice than NFL players if the goal of an endorsement is mass adoption. 
NFL players beat buffet hands down on the "giving people a good feeling" scale, though.

I was going to say "There is an artistic statement here, but I can't articulate it."
I think you're spot on, but I am also getting another statement at the same time:
"i" can be powerful by quietly joining all the other "little i's". 
Here we are, the 3 of us \*paying\* attention to and talking about it. Those little i's are making shit happen.
Also, notice the blood red letters on only some of the words. There is another statement there.

nice Rogan/Bitcoin cross pollination
@_date: 2019-05-01 20:37:54


Thanks.  
i think i needed to realize the truth in your statement in order to get to a place where i could come to see the truth in my own. 
i don't wanna spend most of my energy *staying in* the negative side of it,  but i *needed* to see the negative side to be able to direct the majority of my energy towards the positive side after that.
Something tells me that there is some kind of big picture truth in that that applies to a lot of things.

I am beginning to become concerned that Binances quality control has become a casualty of their growth.

I am into contributing to this, but github itself has thus far been an impenetrable enigma to me.

good catch. 
[BitcoinX.io]( redirects to [bitcoin.com]( (as vs the link in the faq being directly to [bitcoin.com]( My guess would be that the domain [bitcoinx.io]( was bought by bcash shills and they pointed it at ver's site.
In any case, I messaged the r/Bitcoin mods about it.
@_date: 2019-05-01 20:47:22


There is a sub [

 I would guess it's better for you to spend your time there, assuming it is a good fit for you.

I don't believe they have.
I would imagine that if they had implemented it and rolled it back, it would be highly talked about.

Makes perfect sense, because, yeah, the financial system has done so right by those of us not at that table

I agree with you wholeheartedly, well said.
I think the primary reason I am getting down votes is because many people see witch hunts and finding fault with others as a means of sport. I have heard it referred to as "outrage culture".  Not helpful, and very destructive, including to the people on the witch hunt. As soon  as they decide who to attack, they lose the ability to hear anything, and all their energy goes towards hating on someone else.
Whats the quote  again? Something about hating someone being like taking poison yourself and waiting for the other person to die.

10% drop aint nothin to be worried about. I'm just pissed I bought near the top of this cycle.
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:35:43
\&gt;That got me thinking because what rational &gt;investor holds a declining  asset and is happy about it because they will be able to buy more for  &gt;cheaper prices? No one! Literally no one besides us.
Not true. Tony Robbins, teaches that exact mindset.
But, it is only to be applied when one has done their due diligence on the fundamentals of an asset before getting into the asset. Bitcoin is unique in that we can do due diligence on the fundamentals of the fundamentals to a greater degree than we ever could with most other assets.
I would argue that even in the case of gold, there is not as much crowdsourcing in the verification of it's scarcity as Bitcoin, making Bitcoin, imo, more veritably scarce.
(I have no idea why my attempt to quote your op was unsuccessful)

Celebrities are often paid a lot of money to endorse things they don't know anything about even use. 
The reason advertisers are so eager to pay millions of dollars for this is because they know how human psychology works, and they know the endorsements work.  It has very little to do with logic or facts. 
They pay the celebrity to associate themselves with a particular product, because they know that fans have positive **emotions** that come up when they see or hear the celebrity. Some of these positive emotions rub off on the product.  
Rinse and repeat, and suddenly sales for  Apple, and HTC, and Planters Peanuts, and Nissan all go up because Robert Downey Jr endorses them. (All actual examples)
If the decades of and billions of dollars spent on celebrity endorsements by companies for marketing are any indication, the financial skills of NFL players being possibly questionable don't significantly diminish the positive impact that all these players endorsements will have.

in the 2nd interview he did on Rogan, he came off to me as though he is really trying to be fair. They are faced with a lot of very difficult problems trying to be fair on that platform.
