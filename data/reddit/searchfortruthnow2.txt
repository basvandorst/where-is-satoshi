This is not an issue since bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Technically mining never ends. Every 4 years it halves. People say that mining will end because mining reward will be lower than the 8 decimal places bitcoin is using. But it can be extended easily to more decimal places. Just also remember that they are infinitely divisible. All might be lost if noone is using them

Why not in this one? There will be a greater fool until you run out of fools.

Different traders trade in different exchanges. Sometimes more bitcoins or more fiat appear in an exchange causing differences in prices between exchanges.
There are people having accounts in many exchanges and try to profit from differences by trasfering fiat or bitcoins and profit from these differences. For example transfering fiat takes days so these differences are not resolved instantly.
Also minor differences are not really solved because people need enough difference in prices to profit so that it makes sense for them to transfer fiat

I think you are not consistent. EC is a proposal to solve history attack. Because the white paper says something about 720 blocks doesnt solve the problem. I told you I was not online for two months and the chain of last 720 blocks is meaning less to me. Still some one can trick all with history attack for people being disconnected for more than a day. History attack is a big issue and makes it impossible to be trustless. Once people out more than a day have to trust someone to feed them with the chain . there is where the trust comes
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:41:57
Here is the point.
In proof of work you choose in a trustless manner the chain without asking anyone which is the right by simply choosing the chain with most work. That is a simple rule and clients dont trust a node or some to feed them with the right chain. You just follow this rule.
Now in PoS, say your rule is to choose  the chain with the most stake you have the following delimma. You dont know if the max stake chain is coming from the current stake holders or a group of people from the stake history. Both groups current holders or past holders can equally create a chain and present it to you. Both have the keys for staking and both can produce chains. How do you differentiate the two?
Does it make sense?

Meaning that you need trust to make POS work. Probably you dont understand why thats why you are asking. In POS you cant seperate the sold past stake with current stake used to sign the longest chain. So you need some form of trust. In nxt they use something called economic clustering to trust peers which is the best chain. But if you need trust why need proof of something. Just get rid of proof of something which is wasteful and trust some people for that.
It is predistributed. Not the right way to fairly distribute a POS currency. The overlords control the currency.

Platinum palladium rodium and the rest of the rare metals have value and their value is their industrial usage value. (unlike gold that is money for some people and has inflated value higher than industrial usage value)
If altcoins have some special usage then yes they will exist. Over time one will monetized aka money and the rest will go their intrinsic value. For some it will be zero for some other they might provide a function and have some value.
The big money will be on the one which will be money.

I still doubt that. Litecoin needs supporters that is not getting. You might make a quick buck at the top of bitcoin bubble from newbies trying to finding the next bitcoin. But in on it will not happen again next time. Too many options around to even motivate people to buy litecoin. Not my taste. On top of that you have  short term taxes. Also consider all the stupid altcoins  funded by that1.4 billion litecoin malinvestment in November at the expense of litecoin bag holders. People dumping litecoin them last 2 months to buy any coin is out there. You can see that at the decline of price and trading volume and increase of other coins volume. Why be a bag holder?

Let alone with shorter confirmations the blockchain forks thus miners waste a % of the blockchain security on orphan blocks that will not be included.
Also the bigger the block size and transactions the more orphans for shorter block times and thus more blockchain security lost
The reason altcoins dont see the problem yet is that they dont have any significant transaction volume

Sure. The way I see it is bitcoin worked so far flawlessly as intended. No reason to switch. If a real world problem ever occurs we can change the code to the next best alternative. No reason to go through this painful redistribution phase. All the world needs to agree on a value to accept something and this is painful. I dont see if the universe agrees on a distribution value will want to go through this procedure again. Is painful for average joe and profitable for speculators only

Removing asic  adding trust. There is no free lunch.
All PoS altcoins suffer from history attack. Past owners can still create a longest chain starting from the point before selling. Thus you need always to depend on the goodwill of past owners.
PoS will always need some form of trust either checkpoints or web of trust but why do you need proof of something if you have trust? Just trust somebody or a group and get over the proof of something stuff.
In fact there is a bitcoin pos hard fork coming next year but suffers from the same problem

Bitcoin is a different currency than usd which is limited to 21 million. If the us government print more dollars bitcoin will go up in value because there are more dollars around to buy them up..
A kid 100 years ago would have 5 dollars to spend instead of 100 so now there more dollars to buy bitcoins and thus bitcoins increase in value relative to dollars. Not sure if that makes sense... Let me know if it doesnt
Also bitcoins can be sent more easily without bank so you can buy stuff online without a credit card. For example tiger direct is accepting them

Mtgox had problems for almost a year. Just now the public realized that cause the media started writing about it. They are not honoring fiat withdrawal s for almost a year and now it looks like they are not honoring bitcoins. They find a lame excuse for that and everybody is unhappy. They blamed bitcoin protocol problems but the issues are with their infrastructure. All other services using the official client don't have the issue. They have their own client which is problematic and blame bitcoin for a bug that they couldnt distinguish real transactions from faked ones.. They might have lost a lot of bitcoins  due to that and maybe they are insolvent

What is the current stake to you? I didnt login on the network for a while so I dont know what is the current stake. 
How do you define current stake sir? That is the whole point. You cant define it and you need some trust like economic clustering or checkpoints to tell you what is the current stake. That is what I mean it is not trustless. You are not following the network for a while and in bitcoin dogecoin etc you choose the chain by choosing the chain with most amount of work. PoS does not have such thing to help me. I choose the most amount of stake but you dont know if that came from what you define as current stake or some stake 3 months ago.

Apart from the distribution proof of  stake is not a decentralized tech. If the devs remove all the checkpoints from the beginning of the their blockchain proof of stake can be attacked fairly easily.... There are many reasons for that. One obvious is that stakeholders who sold in the past can create a longer chain with more cumulative stake and take over the chain without even owning the coin at this point. (You dont even need that much stake to do that). So you are always dependent on the goodwill of early adopters/pools/exchanges etc who owned a substantial stake in the past.
Proof of stake is against the ethos of decentralization and bitcoin.

IMO the most interesting are autonomous corporations. You can create a facebook/dropbox/google type of corporation with pre specified rules (terms of use are contracts essentially) and sent profits to shareholders without anybody in charge. just those initial rules. No terms of use change like google/facebook do and users will like a predefined contract of service that will not change. They will choose the one that keeps their privacy. If you see the ToS of google when they started and now they have changed against users and we are stuck. With fixed rules that dont need to comply with CEOs/govs demands users will be better off.

The problem is that altcoins popped up too early and people here have little understanding of things.. They are in a get rich quick mindset including the bitcoin services. Bitcoin was unlucky because of MtGox and OkCoin adding the litecoin. That gave litecoin value  huge value and then people moved to cheaper coins to speculate. As a consequence invited many hopeless people believing in any altcoin imaginable. I suspect that on Nov 26 the sheepmarketplace scammer laundered 96000 bitcoins in altcoins which made things worse since at that point all eyes were on bitcoin. Bitcoiners are scared of altcoins and started talking about them trying to explain the speculation making things worse giving them more publicity. Also wrongly many bitcoin services started adding altcoins. If bitcoin goes in a 4 year bear market it is questionable if any altcoin survives. But the damages was done. The only way for bitcoin to recover this mess is to stay behind media for years build infrastructure and come back. Cant continue under this media craze and speculation. To accomodate millions of people needs to grow 100-1000x times but with that comes speculation making things worse. 
I am ok with altcoins. What I m not ok is bitcoin infrastructure to be adapted to altcoins because a coin was hyped. Such short term thinking. Most service providers appear that they expect bitcoin to go to 100K and having altcoins dragging it down. Aint happening. Bitcoin needs to stay silent for years and solve these internal problem of infrastructure adaptation to altcoins. This guys make money out bitcoiners and then they add altcoins because somebody spammed their mail box. These problems need a healthy discussion but is not happenning under this craze and expecting bitcoin to go to a miliion. Even coinmap.org advertises litecoin now. This is a mess that cannot continue. Bitcoin cannot survive that.

You can still create a command economy (temporarily same as they do now) using bitcoin but at some point fixed prices will diverge from black market prices and it will blow up. It is the same reason all command economies eventually collapse

Great question. The miners every ten minutes.create blocks that bundle transactions. In the block structure there is an extra field to assign new bitcoins to their wallet. Depending on block number they assign a fixed number of bitcoins. The.rest of the network verifies that the number is correct and start working on top of that block

Something like that. Glad you saw my point. First of all you dont need currently the coins but at some point in the past.maybe even very distant pass. Or even buy the keys from past investors or even own an exchange or a service like just-dice coinbase etc that people deposited the coins.
The point is not for me to attack your coin. The point is because of this attack nxt is not trustless. You will implement EC to solve this attack which needs trust. Dont get stuck at the attack vector. My point is that because of this attack vector nxt cannot be trustless
Nxt can just use a federation algo like ripple and get over it

No problem. Newcomers should learn so that they teach others later on until we have easier to use and more secure software.
Never used blockchain but these guys claim their wallet is more secure due to multisig.
As for paper wallet definitely try with small amounts first .. 
Try to load them back. I think mycelium app has a feature to temporarily import paper wallets in memory to spend them. There are many safe approaches to bitcoin safe keeping but have a learning curve.

Ok thanks but to check if the coins are stolen or mtgox was selling them they need to publish the withdraw address of the thief so that other users verify that they dont belong to them and mtgox is not lying. Can that list of addresses be public? Otherwise mtgox can claim here are the addresses and nobody can say something against a random string of characters...

Exchanges can simply just wait 10X times the amount they are receiving in proof of work costs and make it unprofitable for the attacker. 
For example if you receive X amount and mining a block costs X just wait 10X if you offer 10:1 leverage. It will cost the attacker much more money

First let's put things into perspective
Second mining energy will turn into a feature. There is lots of energy wasted. Electricity utilities waste excess power during nights. They can use bitcoin to earn income with that wasted power. Same for geothermal. For solar panels people will replace batteries to store excess energy value with bitcoin. Lower cost for them. It is not feasible now because chips are very expensive but once competition heats and hashing chips prices drop to the ground all the mining will move to energy waste resources.
Even biking has excess energy that we don't have a commonly used battery to store. Why not store it in bitcoin. Cars harness wasted energy into expensive batteries costing thousands each. Storing in bitcoin will be cheaper. All the wasted energy can be stored in bitcoins
As of altering the algo thats the cost of trustless decentralization. No other algorithn proposed is trustless

You need to check the rates in peso and dollars. For example check the coinbase.com rate or circle rate for dollar rate. You have to factor in the fees as well. For example coinbase has one 1% in fees and circle 0%. If you cleverly buy them and sell on the right exchange you might get more than 460 since there are times the peso-bitcoin is higer than dollar bitcoin and vice versa. Also you can buy a millionth of a bitcoin it does need to be 1 bitcoin

From features it uses supernodes to facilitate the mixing. Like tor nodes the NSA is monitoring it easy to do with supernodes. The gov just setups supernodes and logs the information and you have only perceived anonymity.

I disagree and bitcoin didn't capture 90% of the total possible market. That creates uncertainty in such early stage and for that reason only it might not go to 20% critical mass.

All PoS altcoins suffer from history attack. Past owners can still create a longest chain starting from the point before selling. Thus you need always to depend on the goodwill of past owners. 
PoS will always need some form of trust either checkpoints or web of trust but why do you need proof of something if you have trust? Just trust somebody or a group and get over the proof of something stuff.
In fact there is a bitcoin pos hard fork coming next year but suffers from the same problem and thus rely on trust.
If we cannot build a totally trust less monetary system we can all go home and rely on trust of PayPal's and central banks

There are many safe approaches to store you bitcoins offline. One is paper wallet 
here is a tutorial
If you have a second computer that is always offline bitcoin armory is pretty usable. You can create a transaction online, transfer it offline using a usb... The offline computer signs it with the private keys stored on the offline computer and finally you transfer it back online using usb to broadcast it.
Here is a link 
If you have two phones you can do the same with bitcoin armory with one offline and one online phone using bither app. This is quite new and I am not sure how well tested is. Bitcoin armory Has been tested for 2 years..
Other options are wallets like bitgo and greenaddress.it which uses multisig so that both you and they sign the transaction. 
Some people use multiple wallets as well. Definitely there are safer wallets than multibit and the safest is to sign your transactions offline using something like armory (may not be the easiest to use).
Never forget to backup your wallet in multiple usb and test your backups/procedures with small amounts to get familiar.

Currently miner fees cover 2% of the network security. Scaling the transactions at paypal levels about 50 times will cover the cost of todays security without block rewards. Overall I am not concerned since bitcoin has shown to be robust even at lower hashing rate (blockchain also cannot be corrupted). Bitcoin will fade if the community and support fades. That is the question and bet long term. As long people choose to get paid in bitcoins it will survive. Mass adoption is a different question..

I dont think all USD users behave the same (and like one family).. People are different... Real leaders will create another sub like BitcoinFamily, bitcoinargentina etc and invite people there. What you dont understand is that bitcoin is a protocol and doesnt care about people's attitude country of residence etc. Just create a different bitcoin community  if you dont like people here. Some people dont like bitcoin and they created , etc... Others wanted to make a quick buck they made another altcoin to "create" a new community. I personally find the majority of people here very friendly. I will never expect 100% to be like that. Thats how humans are... diverse. Until all humans are clones you will find diversity in  humans.

No you cant choose on most transactions because you can spam the blockchain with back and forth transactions. It is a no cost solution. Let me tell you their proposed solution. It is something called economic cluster which essentially is a web of trust solution. It requires trust. If we need trust why proof of something?
No you cant have more than one

Well, your client listens to the network and tells you if there are multiple transactions and potential double spending. If a transaction appears 10 seconds later that should not be a problem since the miners will include the first one. Lowering transaction time has been discussed but leads to messing up the blockchain when the transaction volume scales. At current bitcoin transaction volume blocks take up to 2-5 minutes to propagate to 90% of the network. This is not a solution. It is just a gimmicky advertisement of altcoins to attract non technical people. Look here for propagation times to the 90th percentile  . The solutions have to be more radical like this one:  . If you really need fast coins check fastcoin which has 12 seconds but is practically useless in high transactions volume due to orphans

Yes thats the way it goes. But it looks it is fading rather than developing private blockchain. Still they are submitting blocks that the private needs to outperform. If you are developing a private you shouldnt submit blocks. You increase the difficulty for the private one. They are not evil. They invested so much in bitcoin. I doubt you will ever see a double spending attack of 1+ confirmations in the life of bitcoin. It is more economical to mine.

And as of bitcoin that is not again what I am describing. A pool might centralize but not the miners (by the way the same can happen with balance leasing but it is still a trustless system). Even double spend attacks on  altcoins or bitcoin will not be as big deal as history rewrite. A history rewrite needs trust to continue operate. A double spend means someone lost money. A history is much more severe and needs trust to be avoided in PoS.

@_date: 2014-02-18 23:54:42
You can program if a transaction does not happen within two years for example then execute. If a person passed away cannot execute a reminder  transaction thus the property transfer executes automatically. Or you can connect it to a live website feed to take a decision based on yes/no. Or you can define N out of M signatures (people) to decide based on majority voting. Or other ways I cannot think right now.

The point is that within a community people tend to converge to 1. The reason euros and dollars exists is because they are forced by govs. No gov is forcing cryptos so they will converge. Also, silver/gold have different properties and usefulness. Does ltc provide something different for the end user? no... Unless you believe that bitcoin is gold and litecoin is silver and feathercoin is copper... Nobody will will kill them. One by one the users will converge to one coin and you will be left with the bag. So far it didnt happen because altcoins were saved by influx of new users... Before the influx of new users in Nov. Altcoins were dying. and they are dying now as well... In closed system that no new users are coming they are doomed. One will survive...
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:49:03
Because the civilization was forced to use govs money the last hundred years..
There are many scarce metals (gold platinum etc) but within a free society/village/city (no king or government imposing one) people were using/converging to one and that was usually gold and in some other societies silver and in some other seashells. The difference now due to internet the "closed" society is global.
Currency is a language to transmit value and the most efficient way is to use a common standard. Markets are by their nature seeking the most efficient method. It just takes  time to do so.
the only reason altcoins didnt die is because the there many newbies coming in but over time people will converge... You already see it with shibes coming slowly to bitcoin. If there were no newcomers we would have converged much faster.

Services like bitpay can scan the network and see for double spend submitted. If not in a couple of seconds the nodes ignore the second by default.

Sidechains are interesting because we can switch to another protocol while maintaining the value. The bitcoins will freeze on bitcoin chain and generated on another chain. That causes no inflation and pegged value between chains. 
It will be much easier if something better come along to switch. Just everyone freezes their bitcoins and gets on the new protocol if majority of people agree we can switch. It allows easier innovation and experimentation at least.

Cold storage is the safest.
Here is a tutorial explaining step by step how to create paper wallets
Many people split their paper wallets into small wallets and load them when they want to use them using a wallet like mycelium app.
Also the mycelium guys are building a usb that you can plug into an offline printer and print the wallet without hassle. Here is their idea
Another safe option is bitcoin armory wallet.  the idea is you have an extra offline computer. the online computer creates the transaction you transfer the transaction to an offline computer that you have the wallet you sign it. You copy it back to the online and broadcast it. The wallet never touches the internet since you only need to generate a very big random password  to generate it. (Armory has more advances features like paper wallets splitted into N pieces that you need M out of N to recover)
Similar idea you can do with bither android app with two smartphones one offline and one online.
Other good wallet is   wallet app that use multisig and are more like a bank since you need two signatures to spend one from you and one from the provider and thus you can set daily spending limits sms notifications etc..( more similar to banks)
What ever you try .. Try it and test it with small amounts
Also make backups encrypted with strong passwords incase your device goes bad
It is a bit of steep learning curve but once you get familiar you will feel confident!

Here is how blockchain works.
When you come online you might see multiple chains forks to choose from. In bitcoin you choose the one with most amount of work. You dont need to ask anyone which is the right chain. Thats why it is trustless.
In PoS you choose the right one with the most amount of stake. However an exchange/early adopter/group of people who already sold can use their stake to create another chain from the point before selling and override the current one. Note that they can produce a longest chain with more stake without currently owning the stake. This is the history attack.
To solve this nxt devs proposed to use something called economic clustering that you need to trust someone to feed you with the right chain. If you need to trust someone why do you need the proof of something in the first place?
My guess is that vericoin hardforked their blockchain for this reason. Mintpal could do a history attack and devs wanted to hide such an attacka and made it look like a hardfork. The reality is that mintpal had the stakepower to reverse the chain by itself thats why everyone cooporated. Thats the disadvantage of needing ti trust someone. Not a good idea for a monetary system.

How do you expect 50% of the supply to secure a usable currency?  PoS coins have much much less stake used in securing the network and about 10%. As usage goes up using the stake for security goes down.. People need to trade and do other stuff... To get 50% you need a HUGE reward but then it is like making the currency to just be used for stake.
And yes even at 50% there are many attacks... i.e.  btc-e can create an alternative chain with their maximum amount of stake (think the   stake btc-e can prove it owned as all incoming transactions and without the outgoing transactions ... the entire stake of coins might have passed through btc-e or other exchanges... they can just cleverly create blocks using all that stake...)

Another application might be to have funds of a contract locked and released to the party that deserves it after the contract is fulfilled or not and both parties know that the money are there and are released to the right person based on deterministic programmable rules or a private judge. That can bring costs down in contracts avoid courts and make the job without any trust on either party. Prevent fraud something that today's dollars cannot do. No courts, fraud involved. Just the transaction goes to the either party of the transaction based on rules defined by programs or escrow. There is already one or more escrow  markets. Here is an example  private arbitrators with ratings on quality etc. This  can have huge implications in reduction of fraud.

Why do you think PoW will always be  a waste? It is securing the network like an army secures   borders of a country. As of gold as long as it has value people will mine it from the most weird places even from asteroids that need energy to do the task.
First let's put things into perspective 
 
Second mining energy will turn into a feature. There is lots of energy wasted. Electricity utilities waste excess power during nights. They can use bitcoin to earn income with that wasted power. Same for geothermal. For solar panels people will replace batteries to store excess energy value with bitcoin. Lower cost for them. It is not feasible now because chips are very expensive but once competition heats and hashing chips prices drop to the ground all the mining will move to energy waste resources. Even biking has excess energy that we don't have a commonly used battery to store. Why not store it in bitcoin. Cars harness wasted energy into expensive batteries costing thousands each. Storing in bitcoin will be cheaper. All the wasted energy can be stored in bitcoins

Sure do your math and if it makes sense. It is good IMO that their income are bitcoin denominated... The risk I guess is if another multi pool steals some of 😡their users in that period. However they have been around for a while... They can increase their users and make the money back faster... If altcoins pump and dumps continue for a while they might return on your investment faster. Altcoins have been loosing market share since the November mega pump however multi pool is getting stronger because their users are the most profitable and reinvest. I believe their income will increase in coming due to increase of income from multiple overvalued altcoins. If that happens the stock price will probably increase as well. their hashing power tripled the last Few months. They have a lot of growth. Their competitor is middlecoin.

From my understanding is that altcoins traders shift from. Coin to coin. When ltc shoot to 1.4 billion valuation then naturally much of that went to other hands. Altcoins will keep behaving like that. The more flows into them the more you will see higher valuation out of nowhere. Some baghold them and after a while they move to a new one... If 50% of the market was alts then you would see even more valuations to coins with no actual value. That's my observation. It is just a function of how much money is flowing there...

As for PoS a group of people is developing a nd planning to release a proof of stake fork of bitcoin with bitcoins transactions history in  a year or so. Here is the proposal
However PoS suffers from various attacks that have not been addressed and unlikely to be address imo. Attacks like nothing at stake history attack etc which forces PoS to be based on some form of trust to pick the longest chain( bitcoin is picking the longest chain by choosing the one with most work and thus does not need trust to select a chain when a client comes online) 
If you want to understand the PoS attacks in detail we can discuss but proof of work is not that wasteful (check my other reply)

@_date: 2014-07-25 12:34:54
Not sure but that is called ddos I think. Gavin mentioned it a couple of times I think but there are rules in the protocol to ignore them. 
Also the minimum transaction ensures that a transaction needs to be confirmed before processing the next so it will  cost maybe a cent per transactions.
I think some people didnt really like that bitcoin has minimum transaction but that is the reason

Just understand the reasons why probabilistically on average the casino has an edge. For example if the casino has 1% edge and you repeat the gambling experiment too many times with the same amount you are goind to end up 49% and 51% towards the casino. So it is a losing investment. Better invest in stuff with chances in your favor

No they will run on different rules and thus seperated. The software of each on will reject the other . It is not only the miners that decide. Are the users how much money they put in each one. Miners will just switch the most profitable and mine
@_date: 2014-06-28 10:48:24
To the moon but
You are exactly making my point and thinking as the author of this article describes
However, they might also think something along the lines of, “It’s quite possible that this altcoin will have an extra jolt in price during the next Bitcoin mania because some people may buy it either because they were not intelligent enough to follow the same train of thought as me or because they too, like me, realize that it may attract people who can be preyed upon. However, that is a risky proposition because it will be hard to know if I am the one preying upon suckers or if I am a sucker myself.” They will then either buy it or not depending on their own confidence in their ability to predict the behavior of foolish people.
Thus, altcoin investment ends up as a dynamic interplay between people who have not thought very far ahead, and people who think they are taking advantage of other people.

I didnt say go away . I just said people are different and they can coexist in the same protocol while being diverse. Bitcoin is not @_date: 2014-05-29 06:28:20
Very good question that very few people ask...
First of all, altcoins offer minor tweaks insignificant to the regular user. Some altcoins are not even solutions to the distributed currency problem (for example proof of stake algos, Ripple and there are many reasons why that is the case).
Second and most important is the network effect.
Money have strong network effects. (Think of why platinum never overtook gold while having similar scarcity and platinum converge to the industrial usage value but gold had monetary value much above the industrial value)
Protocols have strong network effects (Think of internet and many other protocols)
Ecosystems of developers have strong network effects (think of android)
Merchants ecosystems have strong network effects (Encourages more merchants and users to accept it)
Volume on trading various things have strong network effects (Euro is as big as dollar but volume never picked up to trade commodities stocks etc..)
Bitcoin combines all the above. Cant be easily overcomed. Also some smaller network effects not so important.
Here is a relevant article : 
IMO altcoins will go from hype to hype from altcoin to altcoin until people dont pay attention anymore. Few people will make a lot of money and many more will lose a lot of money.
Venture capitalists understand the multi-sided nature of the bitcoin network effect and thats one of the reasons they are focusing on bitcoin.

If bitcoin ever gets adopted will have long periods of stable prices in a range 20+ years. Deflation will be quick and sharp runs of price. The problem right now with deflation is banks because in they lend money from depositors and once deflation hits banks don't have enough money to cover the loans. With bitcoin this will be different since lenders will be investors and in deflation average folk having bitcoins in a wallet will not be affected just get the rewards of deflation. If you understand this concept deflation in a bitcoin world will be different

That is a good question. The value is not about price in dollar terms. It is about the infrastructure and people accepting it. Since more people accept bitcoin and use it has more value.
The fact that it is cheaper does not mean it is a better value for money. Litecoin was cheaper when it was 50$ but it was a horrible investment. Cheap does not mean good value for money
Long term we will converge to the one with the bigger network effect.

Difference between ideal libertarian philosophy and anarchist philosophy is that libertarian philosophy wants a government to enforce the agreement or contract. Anarchocapitalists want to let the market find ways to enforce. 
More chaotic but bitcoin is a great example of Anarchocapitalism the rules come from the the market and enforced by the market to avoid fraud within the payment protocol (bitcoin rules). In libertarian philosophy the gov has to force paypal to follow the rules.

First let's put things into perspective 
 
Second mining energy will turn into a feature. There is lots of energy wasted. Electricity utilities waste excess power during nights. They can use bitcoin to earn income with that wasted power. Same for geothermal. For solar panels people will replace batteries to store excess energy value with bitcoin. Lower cost for them. It is not feasible now because chips are very expensive but once competition heats and hashing chips prices drop to the ground all the mining will move to energy waste resources.
 Even biking has excess energy that we don't have a commonly used battery to store. Why not store it in bitcoin. Cars harness wasted energy into expensive batteries costing thousands each. Storing in bitcoin will be cheaper. All the wasted energy can be stored in bitcoins

Have you ever used bitcoin to buy something?
@_date: 2014-06-29 12:28:23
No you dont need a private key. If you want to also digitally sign the document with a private key you will need an extra step
What the website does is computing the sha256 of the document. The sha256 unction is one way and converts anything to a huge huge huge fixed size number that can identify the document. So anyone who wants to verify that you created the document before block X needs the document to compute the sha256 and verify that it matches the one on the blockchain
There is a special transaction code (called OP_Return) that allows you to attach 40 bytes of data and include them on the ledger. That is what the service is using
Nothing stops you to also sign the document using a private key and upload the sha256 of the document + signature if you need to.
I am not sure though  that the will be helpful to you since I didnt understand exactly your need

The pool needs to stop contributing to the security of the network. For example stop producing blocks and create an alternate chain and double spend the transaction. As long as they are adding blocks to bitcoin it won't happen. The longest chain is chosen by peers by maximum hashrate. Thus they need to create another chain with more hashrate.

From price point of view you might see a short panic but it is not a big deal. Hashing algos are weakened and not broken in 1 day. There is plenty of time to switch. Sha-1 was weakened people, software banks moved to sha-256 and life continues. Same with bitcoin. Sha-1 is still used though, some people are switching slower!! but they will eventually do. It is not a problem at all for bitcoin. In fact the devs have a sha-3 implementation ready. Read for sha-1 story here

All people talk about the potential layers on top of bitcoin. Yet we see developers working on altcoins just to make a quick buck. Mine them fast and then advertise/troll exchanges to add them etc. Thats easiest than really doing something useful. Altcoins are pure malinvestment of capital. Both money and brain capital that could have boosted bitcoin acceptance. I doubt people that understand economics accept them. Litecoin was a creation of mtgox that announce that they will accept them a year ago and gave hopes to the miners of litecoin. They are still on hopes. I guess after seeing the flood of altcoins mtgox realized that might be wrong. Some others dont get it. They will get it once they will cause a multiyear bear market. Most of them will run away. One is sure for me, some people are brainless. I guess this always happens during the .com bubble people were buying everything with .com in it. Now they buy everything with a coin in the name. People never learn and thats why many loose a lot of money in the end.

Bitcoin needs to reduce block times to reduce variance and allow smaller players to compete. It is the most straightforward update to do
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:36:22
Average time is design to be 10 minutes. 
Majority are much less than 10 minutes few rare case might take more but they average at 10 mins.
 That is the cost of trustless decentralization since nodes need time to propagate transactions and converge. If it was shorter nodes cannot converge in high transaction rate. 
There are other proposals to improve the time using multisig but they will take time to be implemented etc..

Not picking . Btc is decentralized in its pure sense and it will become even more when ASIC costs go down and price stabilizes. Also this problem you are referring might be for double spending which is acceptable if it happens.  If 3 biggest pools now collaborate to attack OK there will be double spend it. I accept it. It is the cost of decentralization but pools also will lose their business. 
What I am describing is a much bigger flaw for PoS where you lose even your stake. If a parallel chain comes along from the early days you reverse all transactions at no cost and thus people lose their  stake... Only solution to this are checkpoints... Bitcoin can be as it is but it will affect it that much. For PoS is catastrophic.

With these proof of stake proposals people forget that they suffer from history attacks. Past owners can use their stake to produce alternate chains from the point before selling their stake and reorganize the chains at no cost without even owning coins currently.

If you really worried about security you should try  with small amounts to make your self familiar. The way it works is that you have two computers one offline and one online. Online creates the transaction, the offline using a usb signs it and then back to online to transmit it. The offline can be an OS on an offline usb..
Make sure the offline computer is newly formatted and preferably install linux.
I wish there was an option for newcomers to do the same with two smartphones one offline and one online but no option yet..
Since the technology is immature the only way for security now is to take the plunge and try it with small amounts.

No they are just contracts not imposed by governments. Here is a video for philosophy about this  
Also now with crypto anarchism the theory is that the agreements are imposed by algorithms like bitcoin algorithm and ensures no double spend.... If bitcoin didnt impose that then you need a legal system to prevent from counterfeit like fiat do. There are many functions of the legal system that can be replaced by cryptographic proofs.

Bitcoin does not use proof of stake but uses proof of work which does not suffer from this issue. 
The security of bitcoin is irrelevant of the intentions of past or current owners.. 
if  a pool at some point a pool owned 51% it is temporary for bitcoin.
 for PoS if a pool owned 51% of the stake it can haunt the coin for the rest of its life because in the past some pool had a lot of stake and could attack it in the present or future.

Exactly web of trust. As the word says it depends on trust. Not sure if you understand the mechanics of web of trust and the issues associated with it and the fact that we had web of trust based cryptocurrency in the 90s.
I say ripple because it is web of trust of the serves of a company. Extent that to a community you trust why a company.
The question is how do you force everyone to stay on it? By majority a computers? A botnet can take over the network.
In case the majority coming from a botnet presents you a chain with very low stake which one you trust majority stake or majority in the network. 
Web of trust is not trustless.

When wallets/miners sync they can pay a small fee to download the blockchain faster. That amount can go into directly into nodes that provide the service. There needs to be a protocol for that so that a market is created and wallet devs integrate such feature. Does it make sense?

I didnt say that  I believe the theory that money need to be stable.
 I answered your question: Why does the financial news always say 2% inflation == price stability?
Also Economists are scared of price deflation due to bank failures that they have seen in the past. With bitcoin lending will be very limited and losses will be only to investors lending 
For example btcjam lenders might get haircut but it will not be  widespread to all bitcoin holders since you can hold bitcoin without counterparty risk. In fiat there is always counterparty risk since if a bank fails due to deflation it is a domino effect and becomes systemic.
I think that is what economists criticizing bitcoin cannot comprehend
By the way they did a horrible job in keeping the price stable

In PoS you select the chain in a trustless manner by choosing the longest chain based on most amount of stake signed the chain. Now you have two participants that can create alternate chains mintpal and hacker. How do you choose which one is the correct one without trust? That is the PoS problem. In PoW you just choose the one with work and you cant copy work since it costs something

Coin owners create the blocks instead of miners. So you need a large stake of coins to double spend. The problem is that still yet we didnt get a solution that can protect from double spends like proof of work. Really interesting concept in theory, in practice there are a lot of criticisms not addressed yet.
@_date: 2014-05-17 10:25:45
Proof of stake is not a solution to the consensus problem. Old coin owners control new ones..
Consider a pool that mints coins based on accounts users already sold. This pool can have more minting rate than current chain and thus reverse the entire chain. The old users can get the stake they sold back this way and new users lose all their money. They solve this by checkpoints and it is not a decentralized solution..

API is not specific to bitcoin. bitcoin has it is own API in the software. It is like a standarized set of commands to communicate. It can be defined such that software communicates with the bitcoin protocol, the exchanges that buy/sell etc... APIs are available for all sort of services. For example google maps has an API to interact with the maps receive location information etc.... In short it is a defined set of commands for communication of applications and each application has its own API.

Money is the ultimate network effect. If gold or bitcoin might or might not win the race against fiat and return to that intrinsic value. If any wins it will be big.
I hold little bit of gold but I think bitcoin can surpass gold liquidity and fiat liquidity over the long term. It has some properties you cannot find elsewhere including ease of transfer no counterparty risk programmable etc...
Gold in my eyes already failed to overcome the fiat network effect. Bitcoin has a chance slowly to overcome because it can build unique applications that will have people using it. You can think a couple applications like silk road and gambling. I believe more will come increasing its utility combined with the fact that is not inflatable perfect money it will win the race. Any investment has risks and bitcoin is high risk high reward

No also exchanges, services users, nodes need to update their software. Otherwise miners will mine a fork which has no value.

There is a difference. For pos the attack can reverse the entire blockchain. Thus forcing pos people to add EC and other trusts into the system.
For bitcoin if there is an attack it will be double spends which is ok and not disastrous. The receiver will lose money. However for bitcoin since each block costs money the receiver needs to wait enough blocks so that the mining costs way more to reverse. That way it will not be profitable. 
Even if there is a dkuble spend on bitcoin the chain will roll and balances of other users will not be affected

In a few words, it happened for vericoin because it is proof of stake and exchange have the stake to control the coin or perform a history attack. In bitcoin it cannot happen since there is  work wasted (unlike pos that costs them nothing) to reverse the chain and thus miners users and other exchanges want agree on the reverse. 
If bitcoin was POS mtgox could have done the same. The fact that bitcoin had much bigger heists than this like mtgox hack and didnt happen proves its resilience

The matter of fact is that he/she has the private of the wallet as well as you. Which means both can spend the bitcoins. Bitcoins exist in the cloud and are virtual. "Physical" bitcoin is an illusion.

Mixing coins for anonymity requires a lot of transactions and mixing. The one which has higher volume of transactions mixed will be eventually the most anonymous. If there are a few you can eventually associate them with good probability whatever is the technique. There are many techniques coming all day if you read the bitcointalk forum but without volume they are useless. Combining as many as possible with high volume is the ideal.

Someone loans money to you with interest. You want to payback the loan right away but the extra interest does not exist in the capital base and you are unable to pay the interest in this trivial case. Thus you default. However this happens in longer term in an economy. Even worse, imagine if some people saved some of the loaned money. There is even less capital to pay back the loan with interest. Even worse bitcoin is deflationary coins get lost from lost wallets etc -&gt; even less capital to pay the loans. Thus default for some that dont find a chair to sit. People default even planning ahead because of shortage of capital. even prudent business find this shortage of capital tough to fight and  default. FRB can happen but at small scale that shortage of capital is not a big issue since there is a bigger pool of bitcoins to repay the loan. But cannot be the entire bitcoin economy like fiat. 
The solution?  Create more money to keep the system going.. Cant happen in bitcoin thus collapse will happen earlier.

The best way is to make yourself familiar is using it with small amounts first... 
You can for example create multiple paper wallets and load them only when you need them using the mycelium android app...
For paper wallets tutorial check
If you have a second offline computer you may use: 
If you have a second computer that is always offline bitcoin armory is pretty usable. You can create a transaction online, transfer it offline using a usb... The offline computer signs it with the private keys stored on the offline computer and finally you transfer it back online using usb to broadcast it.
Other nice wallets are pheeva and multibit
other options include electrum
or the bither android app which functions similarly with armory but with two phones one online and one offline..
Again The best way is to try with small amounts and make your self familiar...

Bitcoin processors like bitpay is 1% and if your credit card/paypal costs more dont hesitate to offer the discount. Lots of people love discount and thats when you get usage. Because there is utility for people. 
If setup your own wallet you can even cut bitpays 1% to 0%. Lots of open source tools to do that

Nope nothing at stake refers to the fact that there are no incentives to not sign all the chains  presented to the stakers and probably is more applicable to peercoin which has coindays
What I am saying is that someone/group of people who does not have a stake currently can create an alternate chain. Dgex had above 10% at some point (and probably many early adopters more than that) 
 
What is the guarantee that stakers will always be above 10%(currently are 15%) and as the nxt economy expands it will not fall further? Nothing. 
Whether they have above current stake is irrelevant . bter in the future might have higher but a trustless currency shouldnt depend on that.
Even cfb named this attack as long range attack. All these arguments you stated including the defense for vericoin are irrelevant . the matter of fact is that nxt is implement ing EC and makes it not trustless which is my point
@_date: 2014-07-22 12:09:24
My point is that the solutions introduce trust and thats my only point.
As for the history attack if it can be done at some profit it will be done. Early stake holders have a lot of stake exchanges services like coinbase just dics etc. You can even buy account keys from past stakeholders. Once something gets value incentives for attack increase and thats why you need something like EC to protect from that. My only point it cannot be trustless and requires some form of trust. Ripple is similar needs some form of trust but it is very efficient. Trustless is very expensive

No I am talking about something they are trying to implement now. 
Look the issue is that
In PoS you choose the right one with the most amount of stake. However an exchange/early adopter/group of people who already sold can use their stake to create another chain from the point before selling and override the current one. Note that they can produce a longest chain with more stake without currently owning the stake. This is the history attack.
To solve this nxt devs proposed to use something called economic clustering that you need to trust someone to feed you with the right chain. If you need to trust someone why do you need the proof of something in the first place?
My guess is that vericoin hardforked their blockchain for this reason. Mintpal could do a history attack and devs wanted to hide such an attacka and made it look like a hardfork. The reality is that mintpal had the stakepower to reverse the chain by itself thats why everyone cooporated. Thats the disadvantage of needing ti trust someone. Not a good idea for a monetary system.
In short you choose the longest chain by most stake but past stakeholders can issue a longest chain with stake they dont own. That is a BIG issue.
Think about it

There is a world outside of * programmers.(No "fucking" here people might get mad). bits is a word known to people in so many * non-english speaking countries. Just fucking take it and run. Even all the fucking bitcoin websites/services are fucking bit something.

Ok the transactions are considered safe once they are in a block because it will cost millions to the double spender to reverse the block. For a block you need to wait ~10 minutes
However what bitpay and others do they listen to the network for a few seconds to see if a second transaction appears. If no second transaction appears within seconds and the transaction has a fee they consider it safe and credit the transaction instantly.(since it goes into the buffer of miners) For you to do the same you need to listen to the network or use wallets like mycelium app or blockchain info that do this for you automatically.
If you want to do it your self use blockchain info merchant app or coinbase or one of the many open source tools at github

Bitcoin is protocol and thus follows a set of rules. All users clients(software) services clients exchanges clients check the blockchain for consistency. One of the rules they check is if  the block reward which is unique per block. Sure one could change the rule and mine more but all the clients will not recognize it and thus mine a worthless  fork of the blockchain. It will be incompatible with users exchanges etc to exchange it for something thus worthless and waste of their resources.
25 btc up to block 410000 is one of the rules of bitcoin. If a chain does not follow that rule then it is not a bitcoin blockchain.
Now if all clients(software) agree to update that then the rules change and we get other rewards. It is something basically set in stone since you cannot get  everybody to agree on a different reward and there is no incentive to do that
If you create a blockchain following different rules it will not be bitcoin blockchain but an altcoin blockchain. All those blockchains exist but incompatible with bitcoin network. Bitcoin clients just ignore them. A protocol follows one set of rules and not multiple and bitcoin follows its own rules

Well if users agree to use the forked blockchain on exchanges etc with a different proof algorithm who cares about miners opinion? They can continue hashing a blockchain split without any value..... You are exaggerating the power of miners. As a matter of fact if users want can do whatever they like.. They can even switch to sha-3 without asking them. New miners will come due to the value of the chain..

Ok that is true. For example namecoin might have a different function. That doesnt mean bitpay should support it as a payment protocol.

One real advantage of colored coins is that it only needs bitcoin to be liquid with high volume. All these approaches need bitcoin to be liquid and the system to be liquid. To use counterparty you need to exchange bitcoinsnto counterparty and then to the corresponding asset. Ofcourse if counterparty is not liquid investors will avoid it. Colored coins takes advantage of bitcoin liquidity since it does not need intermediate token. Investors want to move in and out without moving the market price and losing money on huge bid ask spread. That is the most important advantage IMO.

No worries. Just for you to see how it works. Transfer it to your personal wallet like the mycelium app. Remember to backup your private keys in case your phone stops functioning. 
If you consider having large amounts consider using paper wallet or bitcoin armory which create and store the wallet offline so that you are protected from viruses. Anyone with your private key can spend your bitcoins . so I suggest start with small amounts to become familiar

What I mean is to have a simple rule to choose the right chain. For btc is as simple as the most work done on a chain.
For PoS the rule is the most stake? The most transactions? The most nodes? There should be a deterministic decision rule. If you go by only stake you can get history attack for those not on the network for 1 day. 
If you go by number of transactions people can fake it by recycling transactions.
If you go by nodes people can set up nodes easily ( botnets for example can give you millions of nodes)
The last two are the easiest to fake.
History attack is the most difficult. But when you have an algo you need a deterministic way to choose so no humans are involved and it is trustless. 
You combine the three? Which prevails in case of a disagreement. I am not against the work nxt is doing. I just state it cannot be trustless because all methods presented can be attacked and need human interription or trust to help people choose the right chain. I just say ripple is doing the same but it doesnt use proof of something and it is not trustless it is federated

Well the market eliminate them then. Look at bitstamp following the stricter kyc of all exchanges fading day by day. And ok for exchanges but for btc wallets the market will quickly eliminate them if they ask for id etc..
No point in running such business

I agree with your last statement but for markets to function some people need to day trade. It is a risk they are willing take to make more money.  I am sure all those taking that risk also evaluate the exchange credibility 
For the rest the best is to own the private keys. The problem with gox was that many people used as a wallet and stored bitcoins for many years.

And then use blockchain merchant app to accept bitcoins. Is it online or b&amp;m?
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:53:50
Indeed and not very accurate . i think they list  the block generator as the first pool the first pool that sends them the block which may not be accurate since a pool can redirect the block to more pools. That might be misleading but I am not sure about their methodology. Someone said that in a past post
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:00:28
There are some similar questions here 
200 bits @_date: 2014-07-22 10:01:54
I read you guys plan to implement it. If not implement does not null the statements I made anyway. How do I choose a chain if I was not online and people can use past stake to trick the system.

Welcome Shibe. There are very advanced bitcoin wallets and easy to use bitcoin wallets. You can go to coinbase or localbitcoins.com and buy or for more options

Actually you should get a 16 sided dice. Roll 16 times. Concatenate the results 16x16 = 256 bits
Each 16 sided dice is a hex number which occupies 16 bits
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:29:10
The main idea of long confirmations is that in a decentralized network it needs time to propagate ths blocks to all nodes . one node  sends the block to the next and then the next etc. That takes times. It is not very visible in smaller altcoins because they have few transactions and small blocks. Imagine if we want to scale bitcoin to millions of transactions. It means each block will be over a 1GB. That means  you need enough time to propagate the block. If you dont wait the guy who found the previous block will have a huge advantage. Say we have a 10 sec blocktime means that before the peers get the block the miner who found the block will find the next as eell. Thus creates centralization

Yeah right btc  is devalued
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:15:43
Yes. Miners are more sophisticated than average joe computer user. If they know how to protect their bitcoins on a computer you shouldnt expect that 60% will get compromised. And if got compromised they would notice right away since their revenue will be sent to an address they dont own. A 51% attack can only double spend the attackers coins nobody else coins are spend/moved. Are safe. You shouldnt worry with such absurd scenarios. Every compromise will have a purpose to mine the compromised computer coins and not to attack. It is way more profitable.
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:28:50

Well fiat are worse :) but still doesnt mean bitcoin or any cryptocurrency will succeed. It is all about network effects and fiat is the king of network effects and to be honest is almost impossible to disrupt no matter what is better
Honestly there are so many parameters of money and you cannot say fiat or bitcoin is better unless you specify exactly the aspect that is better or worse. Also to sustain something like bitcoin you need to believe is better and all people here sustain bitcoin so they are probably biased

There is already a group working to fork bitcoin using a similar idea called collaborative PoS
they are trying to hard fork bitcoin planned in 2016 with bitcoin transaction history.
Here is the link 
PoS has multiple issue including that they strip the most important property of bitcoin. The fact that is trustless. There are many other issues associated with PoS but the most important is that they are not trustless. We already have paypals and central banks that require trust. Why change such a beautiful technology?

One issue is how to combine them. Lets say difficulty is weighted half pow and half pos. That average is the number you use to choose the right chain.
The issue is PoW difficulty increases with technology pos difficulty remains more or less constants. So in the decision PoW play and increasing role as time goes until it overwhelms PoS
Needs more clever ways to combine them . i dont see any yet. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:21:17
All are quite safe..
Mycelium has an option to load paper wallets so you can create multiple paper wallets and load them when you need them...
here is a tutorial
If you have a second computer that is always offline bitcoin armory is pretty usable. You can create a transaction online, transfer it offline using a usb... The offline computer signs it with the private keys stored on the offline computer and finally you transfer  it back online using usb to broadcast it.
I guess you can start with paper wallets and try with small amounts how the procedure goes..
@_date: 2014-05-14 03:12:05
Probably you can contact them on the forums...

@_date: 2014-07-04 10:35:02
Those who have spend (expensive cars, villas, luxurious lifestyle) more than those who dont.
A flat VAT is much more fair .. No loopholes etc.. If I had an option to vote between income and VAT tax I would choose VAT because those who have spend more. Honestly I dont worry that much about taxes since there are solutions. I would even prefer pollution tax than income tax since at least we tax something that does harm the environment. 
Income tax has so many loopholes that those who can pay lawers a lot can trick the system. I dislike the current tax system to defend it. IMO it is broken

@_date: 2014-06-20 22:00:06
Mycelium app goes close to 99% when a tx appears for q few seconds and no conflicting one appears since the miners have the first one in their queue and they wont redo the work to include a new block. Definitely after a block it is committed. To reverse a tx in a block you will need to spend millions so it doesnt make economical sense
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:49:28
I think multibit is good for new users. For android apps you can use mycelium app. For having a second authentication for now need a hardware wallet to verify the transaction offline. For online maybe greenaddress.it has some sort of verifcation.

@_date: 2014-06-07 10:38:40
Yes nothing against these coins but for forcing users through illiquid markets is like a recipy for disaster. You can do the same task with the most liquid one which is bitcoin. I think if someone just forks the code to work for bitcoin it has bigger chance of success but we will see

To create an account for bitcoin just download an app like mycelium
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:54:24
No it is not 2-3 individuals. To kill bitcoin you need to block transactions by 51%. What makes you think bitcoin miners will not switch?
Also this feature has been created so that miners know what block they are solving  but none of the pools adopted it.(around 20%) This will make pools irrelevant to security.

As for bitcoin it is the first Decentralized Autonomous Corporation since it pays its employers ( miners) in bitcoins to service the network.
The customers are the users who pay in bitcoins fees to transfer wealth. So it is a simple but very useful DAC

Like sidechains? Dont forget that if governemtns take over the PoW we are giving value to the chain and we can fork to another chain with other properties and they will mine their worthless chain. It is people that give value. Miners can just come as workers. It is people that give value to the particular history of transactions and not miners. They have power but They dont have as much power as you think.

Proof of stake algos are not solutions solutions to the distributed consensus system. It took decades for some visionaries to solve the distributed consensus system and it took months for some unvisionaries to unsolved it and hype it.
Maybe counterparty but I dont know if it can work with so low volume.
Myriad is interesting but I didn't read exactly how it works to check if it is technically sound.
Still these tweaks are not enough
This maybe more innovative. 
Proof of stake non solutions shouldn't be hyped IMO because they are not sound solutions

First of all there is a group trying to hard fork bitcoin planned in 2016 with bitcoin transaction history.
Here is the link 
Proof of stake has multiple issues. The first two are technical and th last two are economical and debatable
The first is history attack. 
In bitcoin we say it is trustless because you can join the network and be presented with many bitcoin blockchains. How do you choose the right one without trust? By choosing the one with most amount of work thus it is trustless
With proof of stake if you choose the right chain to be the one with most stake signed it has the following issue. A past stake holder / group of past stake holders / exchanges / casinos etc that had enough stake at some point in the history can go sign another chain with more stake and present you that chain. Which one you choose? Well you dont know thats why many proof of stake coins have forks and end up with checkpointing by devs or web of trust solutions and thus cannot be trustless. This problem can be fatal since it can reverse the entire history of transactions
Another issue is the nothing at stake problem. 
Say you are signing a chain as a stake holder and two appear. How do you choose which one to sign? Well since there is no cost a rational staker will sign all to maximize their chance earn money! In bitcoin they have no choice but to choose the one with most work so that they dont waste resources.
Econmical/political problems
Another problem is that is much easier to identify the biggest stakers by governments/other organizations and target those individuals to comply with their demands.
Another issue is wealth concentration. Users are giving fees to large stakeholders basically to sign their transactions making the rich richer and hindering the growth of the economy. That argument is debatable though.
Last one is that all PoS coins rushed to distribute their coins to go to  PoS only benefiting the early adopters and panishing the rest. This supposed to be solved by early adopters distributing the coins to late adopters. That is not a good model and looks like ponzi thinking. Ideally you want noone to exit the economy. All should be on board and invest/spend with their coins and not distribute
Glad that people are asking this question 100 bits @_date: 2014-01-12 03:17:29

No currently the most profitable strategy for miners is to have empty blocks and just get the rewards. Or very very high mining fees. Miners allow txs to service the network at their cost.
Any delay lowers the chance for them to get the reward which is 200 times more that total transactions per block.
There was an analysis in bitcoin devs  list that currently fees are 8 times less that they should be to be profitable for miners due to high reward. 
For lower transactions we need both patience and improvements in the code to compress/transmit blocks faster.

I think you dont understand bitcoin and how it works. Bitcoin has no server faults the pointis distributed and thus fault tolerant. If you refer to mtgox that is a company that went bankrupt. 
The point of bitcoin is that you can store them yourself and thus no counterparty risk. Those who chose to store on mtgox had counterparty risk and trusted humans. That was their option they lost their money. Very few were affected. Majority had them stored locally. This has nothing to do with bitcoin but a company failure.
As for the billion fakes... Still the number of bitcoins is 13 million and thd cap is 21 million that didnt change and will not change. If someone created fakes we ignore them and thats the robust ness of bitcoin. If the protocol didn't ignore them then bitcoin wouldnt have value now

Current transaction fess are high due to high reward. Mining reward needs to come down to reduce fees. mining reward halves every 4  years.
If you are a miner and compete for a reward of 25btc per block which is 100 times more than transactions you will not want many transactions because too many transactions create big blocks and thus more time to propagate to other nodes and thus chance of missing out being the block solver.
Once reward comes down transaction fees will come down. In the meantime any breakthrough might push it lower.. Gavin in a past talk said that it is possible to go much much lower 
@_date: 2014-06-29 04:23:49
When doge had 50 k txs it had 30% orphan rate which makes my point
Now doge has 1/5 vs bitcoin transactions at best and falling. Bitinfo removed the current orphan rate though.
Also ltc and doge have very constant transaction number per day relative to bitcoin (which varies a lot over a week) which make me suspect majority is miners payment transactions
This might be more true for ltc since its transactions collapsed after first asics came on the market
I think dogeminers might mine for fun even at loss.

Not sure what a random redditor said but many people are mining and yes for some people with low electricity mining is profitable. It is an efficient market after all. Once hardware costs drop like every other technology (and more competent manufacturers join) you will see much more decentralization with asic mining. 
Also some people say that to discourage new miners because it cuts their profits. Mining will be always be very sightly profitable for those with low electricity when the price is stable.

No, no POS coin is secure. This is a misconception that needs to end. I am talking about people who already sold the coin long ago. (They have no interest in the coin anymore and dont need to currently buy a stake)
The way POS clients work select the longest chain is by most cumulative stake. Say currently 5% of the stake is  used to secure the network anyone with 5+% can create an alternative longest chain with more stake and attack the coin.
Many early exchanges that now do not exit had substantial stakes. Early adopters had substantial stake. Many PoS pools had a lot of stake(There are way more cases a lot of stake was concentrated). Do you trust them? What if a stakeundo service is created like  and get people together to create a longer chain at no cost unlike PoW..

Just to explain in simple terms. Imagine if number of transactions size per block is 100mb. How fast you can propagate it to 10 nodes and solve the problem fast enough before the others? One node needs to get it send it to others and then others and then others. The more you send it the more decentralized it is. Blocks need time to propagate and that is key to decentralization. It is the most important fact of decentralization. Network latency. It is not visible now due to low number of transactions of altcoins. If you can propagate that in 10 miners in 2.5 minutes. In 10 minutes you can propagate it to 10^3 miners due to exponential propagation. So 10 minutes will be way more decentralized.

Well what mycelium does for example they observe for double spend transaction for 5 seconds and if no second transaction appears to overide yours they consider it safe since miners aleady started working on the first.
To be absolutely safe you need to wait for 10 mins so that the transaction get into a block and cannot be overridden.

Gold and silver  coexisted as money within the same community for diffent denomination but gold was the store of value... read the article. Bitcoin does not have this issue as gold
Currently gold is money for some people/central banks and thus has value 10 times its industrial use value. Gold took off the last years due to some people losing faith in fiat.
Silver has been fluctuating around its industrial use the last 50 years. It certainly has value due to its industrial. Silver took of the last decade because of a silver deficit in industrial use. Not sure if you studied the fundamentals of the metals you are referring but silver does really trade much above its utility for long periods. Thus it is not really money at this point.
By the way if bitcoin takes off gold will be slowly demonetized over the next 30 years or so and it will trade around its industrial use

no problem.... Once you understand that the wallet stores the private keys (password of your account) and signs the message to transmit bitcoins... (It is a good idea to save the private key on a paper in case your phone is lost.)

I think long term they all converge to one. The question is which one. Most likely bitcoin. Read this article.  If you see the number of transactions per day bitcoin gains users from altcoins in stable periods and downturns..
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:17:00
Maybe faking the number may 1-2 big players left the pool. Time will show
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:04:57
Well the altcoin will run into the same problem. Maybe multiple altcoins might help with sidechains so that there is no exchange/volume risk.
Just some technical details. The main problem is not that huge number of transactions cannot be supported but the fact that huge number of transactions cause the blocks to become big and they propagate across the network at a slower pace causing miners to avoid them since they are in arms race to get their block propagated first and picked by the rest to work on that one instead of a competing block.
The issue now is that miners care about the reward and thus ideally for them an empty block is the most optimal. When the block reward becomes insignificant you will see much higher transaction volume and lower costs because more income for them it will mean more profits. Now their income is 99% the block reward and thus they mainly care about that.
Also ideally we want all transactions to be processed by one block chain since they will contribute the security. We want one block chain as secure as possible. The overall blockchain security is calculated by the total amount of work done up to the current block. Security is what makes us trust a blockchain in a trustless fashion. When you look at multiple block chains you pick the one with most cummulative work and thats why you dont need to trust a third party to pick one so the more cummulative work we have the stronger the blockchain is and thus ideally we want all work to be done on 1 chain.

As long as people give them money they will keep creating news ones. Dont forget that bigger networks tend to absorb smaller networks over time.. It will play out over imo..

In general it is tough for someone to link it. Because you transmit the transaction and then another node retransmit it etc. You  dont know the actual source. If it is you or all other nodes. Especially if run a node it is even tougher. Since you cannot discriminate your transactiona from the txs you retransmite from others. It is always a good idea that to use tor or vpn also

If you are a user you can use darkwallet with the same functionality and enjoy bitcoin infrastructure and acceptance.
If you want to make some quick buck fine, speculate with it. I personally wouldnt baghold any altcoin more than day trading since the gains are happenning over short periods of time and after the gains are made altcoins are  pure risk with little benefit. People switch quickly to other other coins and you are left with the bag.

2fa is 2 factor authentication. For example you can link you email with google authenticator to produce a second password. I suggest you try this feature on a new email and see how it works.

I think all websites for example starting with https are encrypted end to end. So if you connect to such website they know that you are sending data to that website but they dont know the contents because they are encrypted. Vpn is a service that redirects your packages through their servers so that the destination thinks that they come from their IP rather than yours. They dont have any access to your machine unless you install a program that give them access. Thats why I said open source is better because you know the program is accessing

You are missing the point. There needs to be an algorithic way to determine the longest chain without human input. If you have two ways to choose the longest chain how can you choose one or the other? IThe algorithm needs a deterministic way to choose one or the other without human intervention.
Past stake owners can fake the chain and become referee as well along with current stake holders.
PoS is not good to choose the longest chain without human intervention because past stake owners can use their stake to produce a longest chain by starting at the point before selling and reorganize the chain. Thus you will need to trust early adopters who sold and don't care anymore for attack.
If we want human intervention we already have central banks.

The chain is frozen for those on the network currently not for me that I didnt connect for a month. How can I know I am presented with 2 chains? I would choose the one with most stake signed it. Wait that stake might come from the far history of nxt from people currently dont own nxt like dgex (maybe current staking is at 150million but still irrelevant to the point I am making) 
Well there is a solution and that is called economic clustering. My only point is that you need trust for that to work and thus nxt is not trustless. That is all my point.
Whether dgex attacks or not is irrelevant. The matter of fact is nxt is implementing economic clustering and thus you need trust to choose the chain from your peers.

If you need trust whats the point of proof of something? Just use trust and get over it. No need to design complex algorithms
Trustless consensus is not easy and PoS is not one of the solution.
Even the bitcoin PoS planned to fork bitcoin next year     needs trust

Nothing against NXT specifically just against all POS are not really decentralized consensus. Unlike PoW that chooses the stronger chain based on total hashing power of the chain pos chooses based on a function on total maximum stake used. Say currently 3% of the stake is used to secure the network. That means any early adopter that sold and before selling had more than 3% can create a parallel stronger chain from the point before selling. How do you decide between the parallel chains? There is no decentralized solution to that. 
Add to that problem the fact that for instant transactions one could keep creating a second second chain to double spend without loosing their stake...
There are countless discussions against all PoS including the latest one called delegated PoS...
On top of that NXT has a very bad distribution and very centralized stake holding hashing the majority of the network now.
PoS is a very bad idea in my opinion and it definitely doesn't solve the byzantine generals problem
If you interested more I can look for a couple links to provide for some discussions related to that

My whole point is that I was not online for two months how can I know which is the right chain without trusting someone. Thats what I mean by it is not trustless. When I come online I need to trust someone to feed me with the chain

Here is exactly what a 51% can or cannot do
Imo the risk is one individual of gaining 51% is a risk and not pools composed of thousands of miners because miners can move to other pools due to no barrier to entry
As for securing coins there are different levels
There is bitcoin armory which allows signing transactions totally offline splitting your wallet into M out of N parts that you can store in banks locksboxes family houses your house etc and you need M of N to recover. That provides both physical and online secure but not very convenient and can be long term savings.
For checking one could use the bitgo wallet that allows a third party to mo ity the txs like banks dooes. There multiple approachs dependinv on amount and usage

Here is an article for you to understand how bitcoin works    Transaction times are kind of irrelevant since services can be built on top to avoid any waiting times.  And surely the security that bitcoin provides is unsurpassed. Anything smaller you are risking your self to easy double spending... It happens often in smaller blockchains..
@_date: 2014-08-25 03:09:05
I believe bitcoin is more apolitical since coins will concentrate to vaults and banks and in pos banks and rich will have huge influence.
Miners on the other dont have much options other than mine the longest chain since their profit margins will be thin. If they try to follow other potical motivated rules they might end up with steep losses

  This is meaningless and loose argument.
It is fairly easy to split the stake into many many blocks (probably 1440) and forge with the other blocks.
Again those been offline more than 720 blocks dont know what is your current chain and thats why I say it cannot be trust less

My friend welcome back to bitcoin. It is important to understand that bitcoin is protocol and doesnt care who is using it. It can be drug dealers, good and bad people, people who want to invest in stocks etc... Having to build the infrastructure for other currencies (mining etc) is an expensive process that takes years. Real leaders create a or whatever subreddit and work to attract that community. Imagine if we had a different internet for each random cause we can think of... Fragmentation is what kept linux a niche. Same fragmentation will keep cryptocurrency a niche as well..

Sure they can copy the protocol and do it. But it wont be compatible with bitcoin. They need to build their own infrastructure and get people to use it. It wont be usable in bitcoin services like  bitpay etc and so many others that have been/ will be created.

Because bitcoin follows its own demand. If you follow the price of bitcoin it greatly correlates with how much fiat there in exchanges  relative to the number of bitcoins in exchanges.

Another blockchain touted to support smart contracts that execute using a Turing complete language rather than Turing incomplete language that bitcoin uses. Turing complete means that it can execute all commands a computer can do but I am not sure if it will be safe for a blockchain to have such capability. So basically the smart contracts can potentially do more complex agreements if it works. That's what I understood. Gavin proposes that the agreements final state be decided by a group of oracles rather than computer code

UProof of stake algorithms cannot be decentralized. Old stake owners can control the longest chain at will. Even exchanges with a lot of proof of stake coins history can produce longest chain than current one at no cost.
The entire chain can be reversed without checkpoints. In short they are very powerful at future chain decisions even if they exited their position long time ago

Sure check bitcoin armory offline storage and lockboxes
The idea is that you can spend the funds by multiple parties signing. M out of N parties. Also transactions are signed on an offline machine for increased security. Never touches the internet. For paranoid security create the keys using a dice. There is a script to convert to keys if interested. That removes trust at all levels.
Another maybe more convenient solution is copay by bitpay. Just download their app

It is the most important issue that bitcoin devs debate for decentralization. Propagation is exponential as time doubles and you fail to see that. IT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREAD TO DECENTRALIZATION. If govs decide to regulate miners and they need to run behind tor that will become even more apparent. I am not talking about current block sizes. Imagine when transactions scale. I dont understand why you cannot see the problem. Anyway thanks for the discussion.

My understanding is the following 
Ripple is a network that finds who trust whom and thus through this trust paths it enables lending to people you don't know by indebting people you trust. While this model is decentralized the underlying protocol is not. In particular to maintain the trust data over time it relies on centralized servers voting on consensus mechanism. Ripple coin only use is to pay when you need to use ripple.
On the other hand zero reserve stores the trust data on the bitcoin blockchain which does not rely on centralized authority to maintain it. 
As for the pairs.users generate them through trust. So one generates the pairs. And if you trust somebody that trust the guy generated you can trade
Bitcoin trust on the other hand relies on thousands of miners.  One might argue pools are centralized but it is not a.problem IMO since miners can switch pools if they find behavior they don't like. If the model relies on some centralized servers people cannot change that.

To outperform a blockchain from the past you need outrageous computing power not just to the computing power. You need more power because you need to catch up the current blockchain which needs extreme power but the current blockchain still goes on which means you need even more power.

1mb transaction limit is the each block maximum size and thus number of transactions that can fit in a block. It is not that bad just we need a hardfork to increase the limit. In March 2013 it was 256kb and increase to 1mb. I think everybody is scared due to the orphans incedent that happened when the block size was increased in March 2013. All technical issues I believe will be ultimately solved. It is not urgent because we are currently using 200kb on average so there is room until we reach 1mb

Because money is the ultimate network. The bet is if it overcomes the network effect of fiat which is unlikely. All the other benefits longterm can be implemented in various different ways to replace bitcoin. Always speaking longterm... Money is a binary thing.

It is not only doge. It is almost all of them. Fast transaction times need to be solved in other ways and innovations. Just think of this. When you have many transactions and thus bigger blogs they take time to propagate  among miners. This excludes many miners receiving the blocks late. Now blocks on alts are small. Lets say you have 1mb blocks that bitcoin faces or 10mb or even 100mb you need time to propagate them into as many miners as possible. Small confirmation times means for large number of transactions the last miner has huge advantage for the next block. This naturally leads to centralization of mining and miners solve consecutive blocks. Small miners with bad connectivity are priced out the market.

Here is an example posted by DeathAndTaxes in the past
"""You misunderstand. The risk isn't that someone could attack the network, it is that they could attack the network with no cost.
Imagine bitcoin worked using a PoS. An early adopter had acquired 1M BTC at one time in the past but over time he lost/sold/spent/transferred them. Today he has no bitcoins but the blockchain contains a history of a time when he did have 1M BTC. If the amount of the stake being used is &lt;1M BTC he could rewrite history not by using coins he has today (a real cost), not by buying millions of mining rigs (a real cost) but by using the history of the coins he once had (no cost). He has absolutely nothing at risk and nothing to lose. If he and potentially others decided to attack the network they would rewrite the blockchain starting from when they had a larger stake, creating a parallel history where they didn't lose/sell/spend/transfer the coins.
They can attack the network based on what they had (but no longer do) in the past. There is nothing at risk and no cost to the attack. THAT is the PoS problem."""
Hope this example makes it clear

The mining fees will be much bigger. If number of transactions increase 100 fold the transaction fees will be more than current reward if the price stays the same. But with enough transactions it is more than secure. The more people use it the more secure it becomes. Here are the transaction fees  per day chart. Current daily reward is around 3600. To reach visa transaction levels transactions have to go up 5000. There are plenty of fees to secure the network if it is actually that useful. If prediction markets etc are used on the blockchain you might see bigger number of transactions. I predict in the future the main cost will not be mining equipment but fast internet connections/fibers/harddrives for miners.

If bitcoin replaces visa there are 2k to 10k transactions a second. There are microtransactions  mastercard banks and financial trading that we can leech transactions. They might be cheap but not zero. Mass transaction processing will support the network even at low cost. 
We already have a min transaction fee so I dont see the problem to keep a minimum fee as well if you are too worried
Bitcoin to work needs to reach its full potential though

Better offline on a piece of paper or a usb stick. With a very very strong password google drive should be ok but not suggested. You want it inaccessible by hackers. Anyone who has the private key can spend the funds.
Thats why many people use cold storage offline and transfer the funds only when they need to use them.  But for small amounts there is no need for cold storage. Android devices are generally safe as well

Exactly vanilla proof of stake is not a  consensus mechanism. Past stake owners can still use their coins to produce an alternate longest chain starting from the point before selling without even currently owning the coins. Thats why they will always depend on devs checkpoints or some web of trust type of solution. But if you need trust whats the reason to have proof of something. Just use trust or better trust a government and get over it Someone needs to explain these stuff in easy to comprehend language for the average joe.

Exactly EC is what I mean you need trust some trust to keep your chain going. In bitcoin luckily we dont need trust to keep the chain going. Even if ever someone reverses a confirmed transaction miners will switch the chain will progress without trust
That is the MOST important innovation of bitcoin. Whether a 51% attack or not it will not affect everybody. (I doubt there will ever be but if there is not as big deal as trusting someone to which is the right chain)

Ok I agree that liquidity is important and gold is more liquid.
The main advantage of bitcoin over gold is that it needs no counterparty risk to store transfer. That is a huge plus and this is the reason I believe is better money than gold and will eat its liquidity. 
You can wait until when if ever bitcoin becomes more liquid but the reward will be smaller by then. It is a risk reward game. 
Also another trend I see is that gold slowly getting demonetized and approaches its industrial value (40 year trend) while bitcoin slowly getting monetized (5 year trend).
Why do you believe gold will be money to more than bitcoin in 30 years time frame?

Bitcoin may or may not be the final solution but I believe it will be because it can be upgraded. So the community will agree to upgrade or move to a new currency and distribution of wealth? I think people will agree to upgrade the software
Apart from that
Currency eventually is all or nothing game. The other question is the timeframe
Money is the ultimate network and history has many examples to show that. Gold in communities was prefered to platinum due to its network effects relative to platinum. Platinum rodium  etc vakue is its industrial use. Gold had value much above its industrial use because it was money.

You probably do not understand my comments and as most nxt supporters the arguments are very loose and not technically correct. (Thats why I dislike arguing with nxt guys)
The amount you need to attack is always relative to those staking at the moment. 
Bter has 5% and not 0.5%. 
What I explained is not 51% and not double spending. What I described is the option for a past stakeholder to show another chain with their stake on it. As an example I explained Dgex which had huge amounts in the past and thus can present you  a chain with their stake instead of current one.  They CAN do this with stake they dont own currently. You are describing other attacks.
Any group of people having more than the current stake can do this attack and current stake is not at 91% but 15% of total stake (and thats different and make sure you understand the difference) and dropping as early adopters dump.
All I said is because of the above reasons nxt needs trust nothing more nothing less. What you described is irrelevant with the point I am trying to make.
As for vericoin all I said they hardforked because a past owner (mintpal) could rewrite history anyway so they had no option. ( same dgex can do but you trust them they want do it or imlement EC to trust other people they will not do it). nxt looks to me more like ripple. Why proof of something just trust a bunch of servers and get over it

No they are not involved. The mixing happens peer to peer and each mixing involves a lot of peers. Only way is to find and eliminate all the other peers and isolate you. Going through many iterations makes it even harder. 
 Future implementations of zerocoin will make this even harder since it will hide the amount and the sender. Still this one is not ready but can be implemented without a hard fork. I am sure the darkwallet guys will come first since they passionate about privacy

Thats not true high transaction number will make it more centralized due to time to propagate large blocks in 2.5 minutes. Not many miners will get them on time. With lite ASICS and bigger transactions blocks this will just accelerate. If you are a guy with slow connection you cannot get it on time and you submit orphan blocks. This discussion happened many times across bitcoin developers and the reason they didnt adopt 2.5 minutes is that it will lead to centralization. Imagine how worse that becomes if you run behind tor. Dont deceive your self and other people. As for the gpu take advantage of that and use middlecoin.com . Dont confuse people with so many options, they dont get the difference.

Nop that is not true. If miners collude that might cost them huge sums of money. 
Also you are missing the point of bitcoin security. Bitcoin security is the total work done since the beginning. Once the work is done is done. Transactions are secured by that total amount of work. As long as the miners mine they add to the total security. It keeps building. That is what is important and not if there will be if ever a double spend. 
What matters is the total amount work and current work. As long as there are transactions that pay fees we will keep adding to the security.
Now we are overmining due to rewards but in the future it wont be the case.mining will be because of utility
Whether we like it or not there is no free lunch to secure a blockchain in a trustless fashion and bitcoin has costs to it.

there are some easier to use options like bitcoin armory
 you need a second offline computer.
The online computer creates the transaction you transfer it offline using a usb sign it with the private key and then back online to broadcast it.
You can do the same with 2 cellphones one online and one offline using bither android app. The code is very new and I dont know how well tested it is...
Other option is multiple paper wallets and load them on your android mycelium app when you need them
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:50:49
I think you confuse a couple of things.
If bitcoins gets lost it is not a problem because it is infinitely divisible. Right now 100 million satoshi (the smallest denomination today) are one bitcoin. Prices of goods and services around you are relative to how much money exist in circulation. Say only 100 billion satoshi are still not lost we will price goods and services in satoshis relative to the supply. This is bot an issue.
As for the comparison witb debt fiat is different. For fiat to exist someone needs to take a loan. If you repay the loan fiat gets destroyed. Thus it poses a systemic risk to banks. People deposit their money in banks and everyone loses out. So the solution is to save the banks to save everyones ass.
Now coming to bitcoin since everyone can store their bitcoins them self they are not having the counterparty risk associated with banks.
If deflation and default happens only investors like   will lose money and it will not be systemic to everyone. Therl rest will be happy since they can buy more. In fact there is evidence that in bitcoin people spend more when the price rises and getting richer
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:01:10
You are trying to convince your self that there is value to shorter confirmations. The fact is that 30 seconds is too much. If you understand how the protocol works you will realize that by listening to the network you can avoid double spend after 2 seconds that is the time a tx  takes to propagate. That's what bit pay does and they didn't get double spended. You have not much clue and try to justify your investment.
@_date: 2014-05-06 18:02:52

@_date: 2014-05-23 06:37:24
Well I have a semi answer I thought my self...
If there is more value, then more miners try to mine increasing the hash rate. Thus hashing rate is correlated to value. Hence you can tie the money supply to hashing rate and increase/decrease the amount of coins based on that. 
However hashing can increase by other factors like improvements in technology etc... Which will not end up in stable value due to other external parameters.
Keep in mind that the volatility of bitcoin decreases when more participants enter. I was worried in the beginning about that but not anymore.. For example look at a small currency with few participants how volatile is here :  in 2008 lost 3 times the value. The reason is too few participants in that currency. If the number of participants in bitcoin goes up volatility decreases.. so long term I would worry that much...

Bitcoin is limited in quantity. Supply halves every four years and the more miners involved the more difficult the computer puzzles  become. You cant have free money. The more miners the less each one makes until no more supply. After that miners are sustained by transaction fees.
Mining is an important function of bitcoin. Mining is the work done to solve the puzzles. You can think each puzzle solving as a stamp of transactions approved and in order to undo the transactions that go into block you need way more mining work. Thus mining is what guarantees the ordering of transactions and is basically the main innovation of bitcoin. Having sequence of transactions without trust. Unlike banks paypal etc where you need a central authority to order and approve the transactions bitcoin mining enables that without trust. Thatis hugely important.
Does it make sense?

Not really. Once you get the miners you can get started. You dont need a lot of money since you collaborate with other miners in pools.

Maybe order a small miner from ebay to see the costs and learn the game
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:54:13
The more blocks you wait the more secure you should feel. It boils down to the amount. For small amouns even one is OK.

No bitcoin is trustless you dont understand what I mean by trustless. I need to ask nobody which is the chain to choose is the one with most work. Whether ghash had a majority of mining or not.  They cannot reverse a stake a year ago.
They can attack the system by double spending a few blocks that maybe possible if they have over 50%/but bitcoin is still trustless and that nature come from the cost of mining. There is no free lunch sorry
With PoS you cant without trust. Ghash can reverse a few blocks but not make the system trustless. I still trust their chain because it will cost them to reproduce a chain from a year ago and delete my stake. With PoS you need trust to make sure that doesnt happen

Not same. Greenaddress gives you a private key and you keep another one. Both needed to make a transaction. Their private key dependance expires if not used for a long time
Bitgo has three keys in which you need two to spend. You have one online in your wallet one offline on a piece of paper( in case bitgo dissappears )and one they keep to sign the transactions along with your online key.
They both have spending limits alerts multiple levels of authentication before signing with their key the transactions. They are definitely early movers in the wallet space and will have a big user base
They are more like online banking that monitor for malicious activity . i m sure they will offer insurance in the future

Nothing is different especially Proof of stake coins which are flawed by design. If you base your longest chain on maximum amount of stake and not maximum amount of new work done old stake holders (who sold) can reverse the entire chain by showing their stake.

make yourself familiar is using it with small amounts first...

If you have a second computer that is always offline bitcoin armory is pretty usable. You can create a transaction online, transfer it offline using a usb...

Fiat economies suffer from deflation since banks go bust and all people lose money. Not sure if you understand the inner workings of the banking systema but banks are capitalized by an x% which varies from country to country. Say a country asks banks for 10% reserves it means that if there is deflation and asset prices fall people cannot repay their loans and thus banks take a hit. If banks default people lose their savings and thus the economy has issues. Bitcoin is like cash and people can keep them on their own so if a bitcoin people on btcjam.com default it will not be wide scale effect just on those investors who take the risk. Bitcoin is more resilient to such issues

TL;DR. In bitcoin we choose the right chain by selecting the one with more work. We dont need to trust anyone. In proof of stake you cannot really do the same because you dont know if the chain is signed from past or current owners and you need some sort of federation system.
First of all there is a group trying to hard fork bitcoin planned in 2016 with bitcoin transaction history.
Here is the link 
Proof of stake has multiple issues. The first two are technical and th last two are economical and debatable
The first is history attack.
In bitcoin we say it is trustless because you can join the network and be presented with many bitcoin blockchains. How do you choose the right one without trust? By choosing the one with most amount of work thus it is trustless
With proof of stake if you choose the right chain to be the one with most stake signed it has the following issue. A past stake holder / group of past stake holders / exchanges / casinos etc that had enough stake at some point in the history can go sign another chain with more stake and present you that chain. Which one you choose? Well you dont know thats why many proof of stake coins have forks and end up with checkpointing by devs or web of trust solutions and thus cannot be trustless. This problem can be fatal since it can reverse the entire history of transactions
Another issue is the nothing at stake problem.
Say you are signing a chain as a stake holder and two appear. How do you choose which one to sign? Well since there is no cost a rational staker will sign all to maximize their chance earn money! In bitcoin they have no choice but to choose the one with most work so that they dont waste resources.
Econmical/political problems
Another problem is that is much easier to identify the biggest stakers by governments/other organizations and target those individuals to comply with their demands.
Another issue is wealth concentration. Users are giving fees to large stakeholders basically to sign their transactions making the rich richer and hindering the growth of the economy. That argument is debatable though.
Last one is that all PoS coins rushed to distribute their coins to go to PoS only benefiting the early adopters and panishing the rest. This supposed to be solved by early adopters distributing the coins to late adopters. That is not a good model and looks like ponzi thinking. Ideally you want noone to exit the economy. All should be on board and invest/spend with their coins and not distribute

Here is the code  of colored coins.
This is the donation balance of the guy implemented colored coins.
Which is 0. There is not incentive to build tools on top of bitcoin. The money are malinvested in altcoins instead of supporting extra protocols on top bitcoin. You can keep the protocol the same and implement whatever anyone promises in altcoins. Their is no business model for that. The best business model is to create an altcoin and mine it quickly. This is the reality. Also do your really think that the altcoin developers deeply understand the code?

Fair enough.. One of the reasons to use bitcoins instead of paypal/credit cards that offer protection for the consumer with charge backs while bitcoin doesnt is lower cost. For example gyft.com is giving a reduction of 3% with bitcoins but they introduced this  later of their initial bitcoin lunch.. Bitcoin currently has 1/300 usage of paypal so I wouldnt expect much. Based on  my calculations currently it is growing 2% per week so in a year or two things might look totally different for bitcoin usage. It is critical to have merchants so that people can use it for everything. I think after that you will see usage spike.
@_date: 2014-06-12 05:47:36
I think you are missing an important fact about money. Long term there will be one if fiat inflate away.
Here is the reason. History has taught us that within a community / village etc there is one common medium of exchange. That community now is global and sooner all later we will converge.
Gold had inflated value than its industrial use because it was money. The rest of rare metals  like platinum etc had value due to industrial use. With crypto their industrial use is none unless they find a special application.

Second  mining energy will turn into a feature. There is lots of energy wasted. Electricity utilities waste excess power during nights. They can use bitcoin to earn income with that wasted power. Same for geothermal. For solar panels people will replace batteries to store excess energy value with bitcoin. Lower cost for them. 
It is not feasible now because chips are very expensive but once competition heats and hashing chips prices drop to the ground all the mining will move to energy waste resources. Even biking has excess energy that we don't have a commonly used battery to store. Why not store it in bitcoin. 
Cars harness wasted energy into expensive batteries costing thousands each. Storing in bitcoin will be cheaper.
All the wasted energy can be stored in bitcoins.

It will affect only to the extend that you might need to submit stricter documentation and private information to exchanges etc. I dont think you will need to obtain a bitlicense though. Just makes the procedure a bit more tedious.
Another problem is that takes out peoples privacy having to submit documents to random corporations. We all know what happened to documents submitted to mtgox. The privacy dead not only in bitcoin but everywhere

Another currency might outperform bitcoin if they get more users and more infrastructure and volume. IMO bitcoin has the highest chance of succeeding. Also altcoins are traded in w.r.t. a deflationary currency (btc) and wont survive once deflation starts hitting (assuming bitcoin is used by majority)

This is different than nothing at stake which assumes you own coins. In history attack you don't own coins at all.
Here is some discussion 
"""You misunderstand. The risk isn't that someone could attack the network, it is that they could attack the network with no cost.
Imagine bitcoin worked using a PoS. An early adopter had acquired 1M BTC at one time in the past but over time he lost/sold/spent/transferred them. Today he has no bitcoins but the blockchain contains a history of a time when he did have 1M BTC. If the amount of the stake being used is &lt;1M BTC he could rewrite history not by using coins he has today (a real cost), not by buying millions of mining rigs (a real cost) but by using the history of the coins he once had (no cost). He has absolutely nothing at risk and nothing to lose. If he and potentially others decided to attack the network they would rewrite the blockchain starting from when they had a larger stake, creating a parallel history where they didn't lose/sell/spend/transfer the coins.
They can attack the network based on what they had (but no longer do) in the past. There is nothing at risk and no cost to the attack. THAT is the PoS problem."""

@_date: 2014-04-03 22:03:30
Blockrate is how fast each block is committed. It is a trade-off between speed and maximum number of transactions the blockchain can reach. In practice you dont need very low blockrate because the blockchain doesnt converge in high transaction volume. sha-2 is the algorithm to hash blocks and it is the most tested one. All these factors are not important for daily use. If you want to go into technical terms start here.

for small amounts and anonymous you can try localbitcoins.com or mycelium trader app. The way they work is that you meet someone locally give fiat get bitcoins.
For small and medium amounts  easy and user friendly places for newcomers  willing to buy an average amount  are    . You need to register, get verified and buy.
For bigger amounts and better value there are many exchanges like     etc... The way it works, you register, get verified and then you need to wire funds to these exchanges.

In short: you own a digital token like bitcoin token and a property like a car can be used/unlocked only by that token. You don't need a deed to own it.

You can program the behavior of contracts

Well it sometimes takes days if they didnt include even 1 cent as fee.
Here is a list of unconfirmed transactions. 
Most are without a fee... I think you should let them know as well.. They need to include a tiny fee for miners to relay it... Most miners include non-fee transactions. Since it is random which miner will relay it you dont know when a benevolent miner will relay it so I cant answer that. 
So let them know that is a problem from their side and wait until a miner who will relay it comes..

The blockchain is something stored in thousands of computers called nodes that send the blockchain to each other. Similar to bittorrent.
If there are multiple fake blockchains you reject the ones that dont follow bitcoin rules like number of coins etc and you always pick the longest from those who follow the rules.
The longest is the one with most amount of work. That is why it is called trustless. You just follow these rules and you dont need to trust anyone and the blockchain just rolls
@_date: 2014-06-06 13:51:57
The worse for PoS stake is the history attack. Past stakeholders can create parallel chains with more cumulative stake without currently owning any stake. Just starting from the point before selling at no cost
Also they need to understand why consensus systems dont work...
Why they should not even bother with premined stuff.  It greatly diminishes returns for latecomers.
Maybe majority of alt investors is blinded by greed.. I dont know

As I said more communication channel will lead to a more robust and resilient bitcoin network. 
What will happen if we have only the internet is that the chain with most hashing power will win and the transactions will be added to the main chain after the chains merge. It is like having unconfirmed transactions for 3 months but once a miner on the main chain finds the transactions will add them. Transactions dont depend on the block so the delay will not be a big issue 
@_date: 2014-05-27 11:42:22
The solution of hash is easily verifiable by all miners. Thats why the networks comes into consensus . Miners and users verify that solved blocks are hashed correctly and follow the rules.

He said that one employee with 20 million can attack the network. For that to happen it means that they have 2000% profit margin which you cant sustain in a commoditized market.
His long term calculations about double spending are pure non sense.
The cost will be the income of miners over 4-8 years. His calculation are very short sighted and doesnt understand the margin compression and flattening of the the innovation in mining. Miners will be buying miners for 4-8 years time frame. The cost of 51% attack will be closed to their income over the period they hold on average their machines.
He looks tue situation now that miners replace their miners every month and extrapolate conclusions

My friend Shibe unfortunately for altcoins like dogecoin bitcoin offers the most security and that is one of the reasons it has the most value. Things will get worse with lower reward..

Hi and welcome
You can think of a bitcoin address as a bank account. Each bitcoin address is derived from a password(private key). The wallet is a piece of software and data that saves and manages those passwords/ private keys
As for offline storage / cold storage I never heard the website you mentioned. Becareful since anyone who knows the address password can steal the funds. 
Some hot wallets include mycelium bitther etc
Here is a detailed explanation for cold storage options.
As for buying I would consider more reputable places like
Have fun here are 200 bits to get you started and try the wallet and see how it works

@_date: 2014-02-19 05:48:23
2 and 3 are attributes of bitcoin. 
1 I am not sure. If it gets big it will probably have gold like stability.. Liquidity on exchanges is really low now to have stability. Coins need to be better distributed to reduce the swings and that is correlated with price range. Derivatives will help as well.. How do you define exchange rate stability. 30% swings within a year like the YEN is ok for you? Gold has similar swings.

Think of it as an agreement right now all software, exchanges etc agree on the longest chain i.e. public ledger. If we all agree we can ignore a split of the chain. Something similar happened on march 11th Due to an incompatibility of the update of the protocol at the time. the community was small and agreed to ignore the longest chain for 12 blocks. It was a big lesson and developers are really conservative in updates.....

Let me try to give you a simple example to make it clear.
Currently around 80 million coins are used to produce the longest chain for nxt. Here is an old exchange that at some point had 100 million coins   .it means the owner of the exchange (or anyone who hacks the keys) can use that stake and create an alternate longest stake with more stake on it and present it as the longest chain at no cost for them. To avoid that you need trust. 
Thats why I said it is not trustless. 
Hope it makes sense to you.

 you spent one dollar and the gain is more with more than 50% of the hashing power like lottery because you can get the transaction back and the reward. With less than 50% the expected gain of double spend plus reward is negative. Having said that transaction receivers should wait at least until the hashing power spend is more than the transaction received

@_date: 2014-02-22 14:35:42
Never forget that something getting cheaper is not always  a good buy. Enron in 2000 was getting cheaper and cheaper and people bought until it went to zero. Bitcoin is money and be careful how you use it. It is your money and you can use it the way you want and you shouldnt take advice from random redditors like me as well. It is just my belief that pumping coins gets adopted by exchanges and devalue bitcoin and a united message out to the world. Bitcoin has many competitors fiat, paypal etc... If 10 alts appear wont be pretty at all cryptos.. Problem is that ltc now are moving to other coins for higher gains and we end up in an endless loop. Litecoin has a tiny miner community and that is not enough for a currency to survive. You need real-life people to get paid into it. And bitcoin already started having that. Sorry for being that vocal. It is your choice but all these alts are concerning me and scare me a lot for the future of the movement. You can look in more innovative stuff like counterparty that is on top of bitcoin. It has a bug right now and is not functional though. You can also trade bitcoin stocks at  (many of them pay dividends) and  for diversification. I wouldnt put all bitcoins there since they can crash if bitcoin starts parabolic move up. On the contrary they go up if bitcoin crashes..
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:47:44
Yes after many years though. If it goes up to fast it wont be stable due to bad distribution of bitcoins. Just imagine if fbi dumps 100K bitcoins what will happen it will crash. If it takes it time it will be yes. Best thing that can happen to bitcoin is slow adoption in 30 years time frame. People here want to get it up as fast as they can though to make money but it is unhealthy for bitcoin. Price dips are the best that can happen since it can improve the adoption. People want to be part of this revolution and want to enter at good price point but it needs time. Not 2 years. Just needs time. Make people understand that bitcoin represents financial freedom with a limited supply of tokens and respect it for that. Current users mentality doesnt seem to respect that. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:32:53
Looks extremely profitable to me 0.014 bitcoins per MH/s Mining is profitable at some points so you cannot say that without asking for electricity costs.

1. Sometime in  early 2016 
2. Looking at last time block halving it went up significantly but past performance does not predict the future so who knows.
3. It halves slowly so that bitcoins are distributed relatively fairly spanning generations. Also it is used to build mining infrastructure and secure the blockchain in this early stage until transaction fees can replace the rewards. Also halving is needed to ensure a cap at 21 million billions. If there was no halving the number of bitcoins would rise indefinitely making the currency always inflationary
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:41:22

Also what about exchanges arbitrage? Would that affect the approach?
Still I believe all financial institutions should agree to  transfer fiat instantly and keep 110% of the amount in bitcoins as collateral using an escrow company.... I guess you need to get banks to agree though or SWIFT maybe changing to this model or some other service implements it and competes.

This is not bitcoin related. It is just a flaw in Proof of stake design. Mintpal could use their stake before hack to reverse the transaction them self. My thought is that devs complied with mintpal request so that it is not shown as an attack but a hardfork instead

If bitcoin become the global currency stocks will be much cheaper and give much higher dividends to attract investment. In the 70's that interest rates were high companies dividends were 20% in many cases to justify the investment. In short it means lower stock prices relative to their value and thus less bonus for their CEO with stock compensation. If the average stock dividend is 1% today then it will have to rise significantly to justify the investment and thus lower stock price. Remember everything has a price. If a stock is attractive you will exchange your bitcoins for that stock. You will see low dividends only after periods of bitcoins price upward spikes.

It is like the notary service but without a third party involved.
Here is how it works
The entire document is hashed and converted into a long number. That number is sent to the bitcoin blockchain and using that number you can prove that it existed before a specific block which means before a specific time. You can prove that you had the document at that point of time without showing the document to anyone at that point.
Does it make sense?

Sure it works both ways. But in a closed system with no new users this will not happen. And bitcoin will not move until it absorbs all the altcoin users...Like it did up to September. Altcoins were dying and bitcoin absorbed the users. Then a new influx of users to prop them up came. Now bitcoin needs to absorb them to move higher. Once it does it will move  Then it will move stronger...

Well you have to understand that in 10 minutes it is more profitable for most miners to sent empty blocks so that the blocks can propagate faster in the network and come ahead of the competition and get the block reward. Things would have been much worse if bitcoin had faster confirmation time..

Also it is possible that they lose all their money  they have in banks.

Very good question that very few people ask...
First of all, altcoins offer minor tweaks insignificant to the regular user. 
Some altcoins are not even solutions to the distributed currency problem (for example proof of stake algos, Ripple and there are many reasons why that is the case).
Second and most important is the network effect.
Money have strong network effects. (Think of why platinum never overtook gold while having similar scarcity and platinum converge to the industrial usage value but gold had monetary value much above the industrial value)
Protocols have strong network effects (Think of internet and many other protocols)
Ecosystems of developers have strong network effects (think of android)
Merchants ecosystems have strong network effects (Encourages more merchants and users to accept it)
Volume on trading various things have strong network effects (Euro is as big as dollar but volume never picked up to trade commodities stocks etc..)
Bitcoin combines all the above. Cant be easily overcomed. Also some smaller network effects not so important.
Here is a relevant article :
IMO altcoins will go from hype to hype from altcoin to altcoin until people dont pay attention anymore. Few people will make a lot of money and many more will lose a lot of money.
Venture capitalists understand the multi-sided nature of the bitcoin network effect and thats one of the reasons they are focusing on bitcoin.

My question is why bitcoin is needed for transfers as currency?
Cant you just use it as collateral?  for the fiat transfer. For example you keep bitcoin using escrow and some programming of the transaction.... The receiver gets the fiat instantly and if you dont actually send the fiat to the receiver after a week he automatically gets the collateral which is an agreed amount of bitcoins.. Is it a good approach for SWIFT/SEPA and other transfers?

It is kind of correlated because dogecoin is mainly traded with bitcoins so if bitcoin goes up dogecoin is valued into bitcoins and thus dogecoin goes higher. 
The problem that I see with altcoins in general is that people tend to move from altcoin to altcoin on  weekly/montly basis and they sell their altcoin for a newer altcoin and thus those holding the non hyped altcoin tend to lose value from bitcoin and thats what is happening with dogecoin price now.
Experienced traders make a fortune. bagholders lose a lot....
That is my observation.

I think he collects transactions and puts them in a block and the reward in the miners wallet. Solves the sha-256 hashing random problem of those transactions as fast as possible. Hashes the block and the previous block and sends that to the network. In the mean time some other might do this faster. If the network picks his block then his block is valid.

Not really. Bitcoin blockchain is governed by two things. The bitcoin  rules and mining. Someone who changes the rules will mine on a useless fork and get paid in useless currency. While that fork will have more work on it our clients will ignore it since it doesnt follow the bitcoin rules. Think of why altcoin blockchain ignores bitcoin while it has more work and more miners. The rules are different.

@_date: 2014-06-11 02:55:40
No we are not we give value to the blockchain they are mining not the other way around. They just are workers. We give value to a particular history of transactions and they work to validate the next block. If they work on another blockchain fork that users don't agree that has value then they get paid in worthless tokens. Users have more say on this.

OK I understand but you have to consider that the clearing house can pay you without going bankrupt and cover your costs of attack.
Also the only thing your attacker will do is to reject transactions and other miners block. Miners will notice and switch pool. You have to consider in your costs the probability that things will not work out and price might not move to cover your risk.
Having said that OK better to have a trust less p2p pool for everyone.

Another reason that faster alts centralize easier is short transaction times. Blocks dont propagate fast to all miners and the last miner has an advantage of maybe half the block time to get the solve the next block until the previous block propagates to the rest of the miners.

Features of high controversy are hard to change (i.e. mining algorithm, number of total bitcoins etc..). Features that are widely accepted like the coming payment protocol recurring payments etc are easy to change since their no objection by the community. Any hard fork change needs everybody to agree. Actually miners are not that relevant. If exchanges services and users switch miners will have to follow. If they dont follow they will mine a split of the blockchain with little value and thus not profitable. The power of the miners is exaggerated. The users are the ones with the most power since they are the ones giving monetary value to that chain.

Make your own opinion. It is easy for any of us to go back and forth. The question is which will return more and imo it will be bitcoin since when the rate of adoption stops altcoins will collapse and that my humble opinion. We just dont know where adoption stops.

Long term yes
Think of gold vs platinum.
Both are rare metals with scarcity and similar properties for money
Gold had inflated value above industrial usage value due to store of wealth status and platinum had been around its industrial usage value.
Now if cryptos dont have industrial usage will slowly fade except the one with most volume that will be used as store of wealth
That is the long long term game in my view.
It is evident now that newcomers influx have slowed altcoins slowly fade. Extrapolate that to decades and full adoption and you get convergence to one

.Different algorithm for cryptography. Sha256 is the older and most well tested and no security flaws has been found for decades. Thus it is used by all financial transactions on the internet. If an flaw is found which seems unlikely it will be a reduction of its security. For example instead of a quaddrilion universe life's to break it it will be a trillion universe life times to break it. All.systems will have plenty of time to move to sha3. Sha1 had its security reduced but not compromised and everyone  moved to Sha 2

These are all the commands bitcoin provides and you have the code for that: 
You can read the code/documentation of multibit, bitcoinarmory and bitcoinJ for java if you need some code to start with.
Basically you need to create a raw transaction with input output and amount sign it offline and broadcast it.
Here is the language of bitcoin transactions  . You can create very complicated transactions and think of much more applications. thats why it is called programmable money. You can create if/else statements and program how money will behave, create escrow transactions/gaming platforms that loosers pay winners etc. Your imagination can create many apps by programming money. You cant do that with fiat!
Basic functionality would be to figure out how to send a raw bitcoin transaction. Here is a website that creates one.  You can check its code.

 for some merchants. It is my view that if brokers allowed to trade value for bitcoins i.e. fund their stocks account and buy some value or transfer value to bullionvault and buy metals. They will sell their bitcoins for other investments and that will reduce the volatility and you will not see such meteoric price rises and speculation. The problem is that the bitcoin economy is small and people dont know what to do with them other than speculate since they dont have other options. I guess these are business oportunities need to be developed. If they are not bitcoin will probably die. People need to do something with that value. Either invest in financial assets or spend them. Both are not widely available right now. Check here some companies you can invest with bitcoin  Clearly the bitcoin valuation is much higher than 10 small companies. People need to put their bitcoins to better value  and stop speculating but doesnt seem to happen soon. Even if everyone accepts it as a payment I doubt the speculation will go away. Speculators are looking for investments. If there more sensible investment options  they will move from bitcoin speculation to other assets for speculation and smooth it out.

If you want alternatives wait for different architectures. Check mastercoin for example that tries to implement an exchange or peercoin if you believe in inflationary currencies. Litecoin is not different is the same thing. People found a way to make more money fast and is not good long term. Many people abandom them after they make their money. Lots of wasted capital that can be invested in coins on top of bitcoin for example that give value and a solid message. Something different at least. Doesnt make sense to have silver and gold in cryptos. Is like increasing the money supply and confusion. We need to compare 2 things if there is a difference to decide. They dont have a difference.

No I guess. Over the longterm maybe. If the number of transactions rise 100fold without price increase they will cover that cost by transactions. it is not happening right now.

From what I understand, a change accepted by a % of miners will create 2 parallel blockchains with common wallet accounts up to the point of the split. It is like creating a second currency. Users, merchants, exchanges etc validate if the blockchain matches the constraints of their client. If it doesn't they reject it. So you have to get people to install your new client. Or if you dont like the change you can install the modified client and sell your coins of chain to and buy more of chain 1. In the end is a consensus of users and not miners. Users are giving value to it so that miners mine.

To deeply understand it needs understanding cryptography but I ll try with simple words. Each set of data i.e. a transactions data, previous transaction hash etc can be hashed to create a digital signature but without the private you cannot solve it unless you brute force which takes quadrillions of years for bitcoin. However the protocol requires to find a simpler solution to the hash number that can be solved in 10 minutes. So the miners are looking for that hash by randomly checking all solutions of the hash of current transactions. Think of the current set of transactions as commands A sent to B, D sent to E etc... If you collect them you can create an a hash on all data and each hash is unique for each block.

Thiefs have always been finding ways to steal money. while what you are describing looks impossible for me to do, if a thief attacks and ATM or any business is not the fault of the network to ensure reliable internet connection. It is up to the individual business to  find ways to ensure their business connection is protected. The network is neutral and does not understand such schemes. If a thief robs a bank, is it the local currency like US dollar fault? No banks developed methods to reduce such instances. Same applies to this case. The ATM guys have to use secure and verification schemes to avoid Man in the middle attacks. Not bitcoins fault.

Yes if you can find proof of work scheme that does not improve with technology improvements. You can use the difficulty as a proxy to all currencies in the world averaged by their use in mining. Increase in price will mean increase in difficulty (It is more profitable to mine) and you can increase/decrease inflation of coins based on that algo.
There are some Proof of work schemes that affected by many different factors and thus make them less variable to chip advancements than bitcoin but in general it needs a lot of planning. What if in the future a technology spikes the difficulty and thus increasing the inflation

An awesome way to see how wonderful payment system is to download the blockchain info app transfer 5-10 dollars worth of bitcoins to your wallet and pay for something. A hands on experience will give you a better perspective. It is like cash for the internet. You dont store your wealth in cash. You have small amounts that you need the coming days. Like physical cash, you have full control of the money. Something that you might not value but others do. Once this extreme speculation dies which will take many years and price is stable over month periods it will be great to have digital cash.

Hi Matt,
After you get your head around the bitcoin protocol.
You can check out interesting to stuff to report that are under development on top of the bitcoin protocol like trustless exchanges, issue of bonds, stocks etc  or 
With the MFGlobal bust there is a clear need for a way to exchange without a third party involved. These might take a while to develop but they can change finance. Exchanges will be regulated by math rather than governements/individuals who want to steal money.
Also you can report jobs offered for  bitcoins:
Also some industries might be transformed like the press. People can monetize internet news reading by micro payments per news article. An example here 
Similar approach are proposed for music artists etc.
Bitcoin can disrupt remittances like western union if it gets easier to acquire in the future since the transfer will be frictionless with minimal cost.

A service to securely transfer value. For example a stock broker or bullionvault needs to add bitcoin to transfer value (Some people want their savings on gold or stocks and withdraw 1000$ a week for expenses). They will not implement it since they are scared of security. If a service could do that as a plugin to their service might be  easier for them to integrate with features withdrawing to 1 specific address/withdraw limits to avoid hackers.
Also a service/wallet that can insure up to 1000 mbitcoins with a weekly fee will be useful.

Again any interference between the actual network and a fake network is a man in the middle attack whether it happens in the real world or virtual world. Businesses that are attacked and cannot solve this problem will simply disappear because they would loose money. Companies that find solution will take over.ATMs are owned by the individuals at the physical location. They put the cash and the bitcoins. If they cannot secure it they will loose money and simply it wont be profitable to run. The market will clear them out (They will loose money) and those that can secure their ATM will survive as simple as that. Same issue might happen with hardware wallets. Human fraud is a problem and is solved over many many years of reputation or appropriate laws though as history shows are not effective.

It is wrong that is seen as an investment. It started as a movement to opt out of the banking system and be your own bank. The way I see it is that you can store value in stocks or gold in a broker and transfer weekly/daily amount that you need to live. At some point we see the reputation of store of value collapse. But it is an excellent and efficient payment system. It should be viewed that way. The value has to collapse at some point to throw out the speculation and focus on its utility. It is not a fad. It is what it is and people view it as extreme store of wealth which it should not be at the moment. Also, I dont expect this mindset change to be coming from the older generation but from  younger generation. Also, for people understanding how to secure them this is not a big issue. For non technical people it is up to business to propose easy to use ways to secure them.

A sophisticated attacker might have incentive for very large transactions to write special code to try this so for large transactions waiting until verified is better.

For how to mine check As for mining, anyone can run it. That's why it is decentralized and many people are mining. They are trying to find a solution of the current set of transactions which requires brute force which means try all combinations randomly. The one that finds the random solution first of the current transaction set creates a new block with the reward to his address and announces it to the network. The network verifies that all rules are ok and not broken and does not want to waste so starts from there for the next set of transactions. Keep in mind that the random solution involves the previous in the randomness so all miners run the latest block. Mining is a service to the network and you get money to service the network.

If most coins are out of circulation it can have high value. Imagine if you mine a coin of 100 billion coins and only 1 is circulating on exchange. If 1 bitcoin matches you have 100billion valuation.

Most are held by the ripple labs company I suppose.

The margins are thin. If the transaction fees to be processed are 20 bitcoins (The miners get that transaction fee) and 100 people mine with equal processing power they will get 0.2 each.

Depends on the speed of the network but on average yes. We need this waiting time to keep the network decentralized. Shorter time will have the blocks propagated to fewer nodes and those closer together in connection speed have advantage on finding the block. Thus excludes many participants on the verification as number of transactions increases. Imagine having to send 1GB of transaction in 10 seconds. The previous creator will get the block and find the next until people get the next GB and so on. It is the curse to keep the network as decentrilized as possilble and thus to the hands of average person. It is good though that you dont need to wait 10 minutes for verification since you can listen to nodes for double spend and if that doesnt happen in a few seconds the likelihood of that happening is small and thus dont deserve your time to wait!

No I mean the amount from transaction fees will be higher than the reward. Right now is around 50 times less. Keep in mind that the reward will get less over time. Eventually users usage will pay that electricity. If it is used a lot means users are willing to pay that. You may think is a waste but it service to secure the network. Think of paypal how much they waste as well on legal and other costs on each transaction. That is more waste! The economy will soon support that electricity bill and it will be tiny relative to its use.

They automatically convert to fiat and send them to your bank account at the end of the day. You can choose to keep a percentage (Maybe fraction of your profits) of bitcoins if you want as well. If you dont you can get the full amount in USD. You can offer a slight discount if you want since you save on credit card fees.

No I didnt want to do that. He has to do his research. I want to urge him to do his research actually. Security doesnt come only by the layers of hashing.

Thanks for the tip, It is the first time I am getting tipped!! I ll surely spend it in daily needs once some local merchant accepts it.
Just to elaborate more think of the blocksize being 10mb or even worse 100mb (for 700 transactions per second vs 2000 tps for visa) and you need to propagate that to 10000 nodes. The more time you have to propagate it the more decentralized the network can get. If some guys get at 2.2 minutes they are disadvantaged since they have only 0.3 to do hashing. Same scenario for 10 minutes they have 7.8 minutes to do the hashing. The advantage in the bitcoin case for ultra fast companies that have fibers and are close to each other and get it instantly is 22%  for litecoin case is 88% so the small guy gets out of the way.
Bitcoin devs and miners are not dumb. If it is viable, it is one hard fork away to go to even 10 seconds.
Also, Scrypt coins are dominated by bots and this is an advantage of ASICS since people that care to instead of buying  bitcoins to  mine at a slight discount. (It is not for huge profits but think of it as buying bitcoins). Probably bots were responsible for 51% attack on Scrypt coins.

Because namecoin imo is a bad design. It is focused on money instead of dns service. For example it a fee to pay to register the domain that is fixed and not free market determined. The higher or lower the price goes it affects the service. It is a bad design and people need to come up with a free market way to price/register these domains. Some people registered so many at no cost and you cannot get the domains. They should be auctioned at any point imo.

You got it backwards. You need to invest in infrastracture like p2p exchanges.

bitstamp should be ok they handle bigger amounts. The only one not reported with deposit/withdraw issues. Send a smaller amount to check it out and once familiar send a bigger one. Make sure you have two factor authentication before any transfer.

Hi Matt, I was wondering if you ever tried  . It is the most secure way as of now to store bitcoins offline and ease of use when you need them. You can try it with small amounts.

You dont need to mine to witness the transactions. You can view them here.  By mining you are verifying that the transactions are legit.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:07:57
Yes they are included by people that find block. The miners of that region will loose the rewards of mining. Thats the biggest cost for them. For days, still it is ok but a sofisticated attacker can send two transactions one to pay and the same amount  to another address he owns before the miners sent to the other network and he can possibly double spend that since people in the isolated country will think that it went through.

Bitcoin is not the same deflation as fiat. In fiat deflation assets i.e. houses go down banks lose money and go bankrupt and people lose their depotits. (Psychological effect) In bitcoin each person is its own bank and thus this doesnt happen. In fact gyft reported that when price goes up people spend more and when it goes down they spend less. Fiat are debt based and they suffer from debt destruction and deflation. Bitcoin is different. At some point economists might realize this but not soon enough. Maybe once the facts are blinking in front of them they might be convinced. In Bitcoin world deflation is like cell phones that they get cheaper every year and people buy them because they got cheap and need them. They dont buy them on debt that they need to get more expensive so that the economy doesnt collapse. This is the bitcoin world.

Check localbitcoins.com and find a reputable buyer in your area of interest and contact him/her each time. If there are not many the spread might be high. If not use an exchange until infrastructure builds.

Bitpay is converting to dollars right away from what I understand. They said bitcoin market needs derivative contracts to hedge againsts losses. So I guess someone does that until then they have increased risk. Since their inception they have been to greater crashes so I think this is nothing for them.
