Well, in 2016, many of the bullish investors called for a $10K Bitcoin by 2018. People thought it was a crazy and unreal prediction since Bitcoin was being traded around $300-400 back then. But just look at what happened. Not only did we reach $10K, Bitcoin surpassed it and reached over $19K. Anything is possible at this point.

Same here man. My wife gets tired of me watching Bitcoin videos on YouTube and listening to podcasts in my car. I must say, she's extremely supportive and believes in it, even though she doesn't fully understand it. Every now and then, she will be like, "here's $100, put it in our Bitcoin babe". The other day I mentioned I was going to sell some and she got very upset, "Don't you fucking dare sell the Bitcoin!" It's insane because, she doesn't really understand it-- yet she just knows it's the future and just has that assurance.

Never buy when Bitcoin is up 10-25% in the last 24 hours. All those fools that bought and went "all in" at the top deserved to lose their money. Even in the latest rallies, whenever you feel like FOMOing in, just fucking buy $5-$20 just to get it out pf your system.

Here's the reality. You cannot control the market, but you can control your actions. For those who were FOMOing a couple of weeks back, it's probably because you were not well positioned if Bitcoin were to reach above $20K, $30K, $40K, etc. These red days are the opportunity to buy and position yourself in this wild market. Do not get left out. And do not wait until we see those +15% green days until you decide to finally accumulate.

My family had dinner at this place last night. Bill was around $100. I was charged a $4 fee for paying with my card. If this transaction was with Bitcoin, the network fee would have been around $0.05 cents. So let me get this straight... You are telling me Bitcoin wouldn't have solved this problem? Am I missing something? Because I will gladly pay pennies over $4 in fees any day. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 01:05:54
Be careful about telling family and friends about Bitcoin. Some people are just not that tech-savvy, financially competent or just plain fucking stupid to invest in Bitcoin. I made the mistake to tell my coworkers about Bitcoin and it became a fucking disaster. One of my coworkers stupidly transferred his $500 Bitcoin purchase to a Bitcoin Cash wallet. Another one bought 0.05 BTC during the December 2017 ATH, she ended panic selling last June. One of the Senior Managers lost his wallet keys and asked me who to contact for Customer Support to retrieve his lost Bitcoin - - holy fuck, the list goes on a bit further and they all sort of hate me or try to blame me for it. They also talk so much shit about how Bitcoin is a scam because its price dropped so much since December 2017. Tell people I know about Bitcoin... Never again.

From a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin has been forming tiny bull flags on the hour charts. Extremely bullish on the short term. The volume in the last 24 hours has been absolutely insane. Fear and greed index shows the market neutral, which gives us room for more upside price action.

That my friend, are FOMOers. People who make comments such these are probably people who have known about Bitcoin for years, and didn't buy throughout the bear market. Now that Bitcoin is on an uptrend, all of a sudden they're interested and feel unprepared if we hit a new a new ATH.
Anyone reading this, ask yourself this. If Bitcoin were to reach 20K tomorrow, are you prepared? Are you holding a nice amount of Bitcoin that you will be comfortable with? What it Bitcoin reached $50K next month? Are you prepared? People need to look at what position they're currently in and ask themselves if they are satisfied if we were to moon tomorrow.

The only reason we even had an alt-season was because of Ethereum. My God, they hype behind Ethereum was very massive that at some point Ethereum's market cap was extremely close to compete with Bitcoin. Not going to lie, I almost thought Ethereum was going to be  in Coinmarketcap.com. It got very close, hence, altcoins started getting attention. Verge, XRP, Monero,.. All very hyped. hell.. Dash was worth $1000 at some point... It's all over now. The hype behind Ethereum is pretty much gone as well the rest of the alts. Bitcoin wins. We won't see another alt season soon unless some promising ICO that's really innovative comes out with heavy dev support like Ethereum had.

HODLing it's fucking stupid. I started accumulating from July 2018 through May 2019. Sold most of holdings when we dipped from 14K to 12K. Why would you sell in my shoes? The profits were too good and I would forever kicked myself in the balls if I had "HODLed" back to 7.5K.

Maybe it's just me... But I have the same tingling feeling I had back in January /February 2019. "Expert" analysts will come out in the news calling for another drop soon. We will probably stall in the $6K region for awhile until blastoff.. I dont know, something is brewing in the back room. Like if the whales purposely dumped Bitcoin to these levels because some huge news is about to be announced. Oh yeah, btw.. The stupid halving is up in May. Regardless, these prices are fabulous.

I feel that it would be good for the crypto space if Bitcoin were to drop even lower, even below $3000. Why? This would eliminate and flush out all the scam projects, shitcoins, weak hands, and hit these exchanges right where it hurts. Coinbase Pro fees are now ridiculously stupid and Cash App is now charging fees to buy Bitcoin. Jack Dorsey is a lying hypocrite. Not to mention that although I see more and more Bitcoin ATMs here in Los Angeles, the 22% commission fees are just fucking stupid. All these companies and organizations trying to get greedy on people who just want to buy Bitcoin need to be wiped out.

Welcome to Bitcoin friend. There are hundreds on videos on YouTube about getting started with Bitcoin. The easiest way is setting up an account on Coinbase to buy. Download the Coinbase or Cash app.  To store your Bitcoin you need your personal Wallet. I recommend BRD Wallet.  rule is to never hold you Bitcoin in an exchange. So whenever you are done buying/trading Bitcoin, transfer your funds to your Bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2019-12-08 12:40:08
Wait... People are still leaving Bitcoin in exchanges? I get my shit out immediately if I am not trading. Every. Single. Time

I installed it about 2 weeks ago in my Android phone.

BRD is the most trusted and reliable in my opinion. My only complaint is that when sending Bitcoin out of this wallet, it seems to always generate a lower than usual network fee. It's a good thing I guess but cheapening out on transaction fees will cause delay in confirmations. The last time I sent Bitcoin from BRD it  took 14 hours to get the first confirmation. Maybe it's BRD, or maybe its Bitcoin's congested mempool

I am not buying right now. There's not enough data short term on what the hell is going on. 
These 20%+ spikes that occur in in less than an hour, usually follow with a very significant retracement in the next few days. If it slowly starts reaching towards $5400 in the next few days instead, we may have another mini FOMO calve run again. Don't take financial advice from strangers on the internet. Always trust your gut and wait for your perfect moment to accumulate.

Most likely yes. Less reward for miners equals to more miners shutting down due to less profits. Continued demand for Bitcoin, less BTC supply coming to the market and less active miners will only drive the price up. In my opinion, we are at the bottom. The recent Bitcoin ETF filing withdrawn news didn't affect much of Bitcoin's price. Accumulate now.

Extremely reliable cars, my friend's 2009 Element has 300K miles and runs so smoothly. These cars are the swiss knives of SUVs. I would buy one but they have been discontinued since 2011.

Sold out my whole trading bag of my holdings early this month at $10,500 once  volume was decreasing and we started forming a descending triangle pattern. These perma-bulls said Bitcoin was forming a "bullish pennant". Sorry, jack. I know a descending triangle when I see one. The pattern forming in the last 3 months was a textbook classic, bearish pattern. 
For those who have been holding long term, my advice is.. Listen to your gut, learn to take some profits at some point, never sell all your holdings (2 bags: 1 for HODLing, 1 for trading), dollar cost average.

A pull back was important and healthy for Bitcoin. It's long overdue. Once we see where our resistance area is, it's time to accumulate.

From a long term persepective, a short term pull back will be extremely healthy and bullish for Bitcoin. It's very much possible since we have been oversold all month of May. If it happens and we go below $7K, I will be accumulatong heavily. In my opinion, this is the bull market.
