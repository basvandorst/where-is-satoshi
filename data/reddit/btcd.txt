Question:  If your servers ever go down, is it possible to access the bitcoin in the verso card wallet by transferring the private keys to the bitcoin-qt, multibit or blockchain.info client wallets?

Thanks for the information.  I am currently using the blockchain.info wallet, but, after looking at your website and the iPhone app, I am interested in switching to the versocard and versocard wallet.  
What blockchain.info does is provides me with a wallet.aes.json file (and also a paper wallet) that I  can use to load into a different bitcoin software (such as multibit) in the event that the blockchain.info wallet were to permanently go offline.  
Unfortunately, I am not a software engineer, and do not know how to read open source software code.  So my question is this:  If I buy the sliver versocard and use the verso wallet, and the verso wallet were to permanently go offline, would I need to hire a software engineer to assist me in transferring the bitcoin to a qt or multibit wallet?

Bitinstant is licensed in most states as a money transmitter in its capacity as a licensed agent of Obopay, a registered money transmitter.  The states in which Obopay is a licensed money transmitter are set forth in this link:  
I have been very pleased with my six separate purchases of bitcoin from Bitinstant during 2013.   Each time, I have received the bitcoin in my blockchain.info wallet within 10 minutes after providing the cash to CVS.  The whole process - from ordering the bitcoin on the Bitinstant website, printing out the ZipZap receipt, driving to the local CVS, using the red MoneyGram phone to get the transaction approved, and paying the CVS cashier the cash to purchase the bitcoin - usually takes me less than 30 minutes from start to finish.  That is as close to instant gratification that you can get when ordering bitcoin!
