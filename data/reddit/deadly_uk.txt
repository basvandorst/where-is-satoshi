Excellent, thank you.

Hi there. Coinbase is trustworthy and insured, however, its best practice not to leave large amounts of money on an exchange. If they get hacked, go bankrupt etc...then you'll be left potentially high and dry. You can use a paper wallet, install a bitcoin client on your pc and safely store the wallet.dat file or buy a hardware wallet.

Oh wow. The world is really starting to wake up to this. Exciting times ahead!

Yeah, checking the current price has become like a tick. Literally find myself waking up in the morning and checking the coindesk charts. FML....

No worries. Yeah it is that easy, but...you won't make a 3k profit from 13.5k-&gt;16.7k unless you buy a whole bitcoin. That doesn't mean you need to buy a whole bitcoin to make a profit, if you buy say $100 worth you'll get the percentage increase gain on it. It can go down as easily as it goes up though! The same is true for other currencies though...e.g. Litecoin and Ethereum.

Yeah its definately peaking more peoples interest. I have a friend at work who has done what I've done...started buying up various cryptocurrencies for a bit of fun (not huge amounts).

...but don't forget to donate on the way out.

Oh cool. Is this the same for LTC and ETH too? So if I bought a hardware wallet I could transfer all to it for free?

Does your bank charge you $15-20 every time you use an ATM? or every time you buy something on card? No. This is a stupid price to pay for simply moving your bitcoin from one wallet to another!
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:13:02
No. I said I'm *concerned* about it, and asked for your thoughts! Its hard to tell what is "fake news" and what is legitimate with so many articles around.

The truth is, no one really knows. Bitcoin is very volatile and susceptible to announcements in the press - both negative and positive. The lesson is not to invest more money into it than you can afford to lose...its not unlike gambling at a casino. This time next year it could be worth double its current value...or it could be worth nothing. In short: do not dump all of all your money into it! Hope that helps.

I'd like to see HR's face if I walked into their office asking to be paid in BTC.

Switch to Google authenticator. Much more convenient, and allegedly more secure.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:04:01
Agreed. This is a good thing. Improved security from both an InfoSec and fiscal point of view benefits everyone.

You can avoid that fee. Go to GDAX...its the exchange coinbase uses. you can use your same coinbase account and transferring your coins/money in and out of it is free between the two. The fees for conversion and selling are much lower and you generally get a better rate as well.
