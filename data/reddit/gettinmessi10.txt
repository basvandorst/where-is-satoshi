I agree, the elephant in the room that only few such as Antonopoulos have the gall to publicly discuss is how BTC disrupts gov’t and old money institutions.
It’s not like in the past when the term “disruption” wasn’t yet coined. All those in power know what happened after the internet arrived. This time around they have he foresight to prepare accordingly. 
We are about to enter the Irresistible Force Paradox: “What happens when an unstoppable force (crytpo) meets an immovable object (gov’t).”
Ironically, for those who follow ETH. Vitalik answered in his own genius saying “the former passes through the latter. Duh.” 
It’s the matchup we’ve all been waiting for. Game on.

I see what you’re saying and that may be true if they are disinterested in BTC. But if Wall Street wants in they want in at a better price. Point taken though - the dip may be a result of millennials hitting their spending limits and causing a peak for now. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:38:57
All a matter of time IMO. Jamie Dimon is chief troll and manipulator but it’s hilarious how fast he lost credibility. He tried to use his clout to scare people the first time. But every subsequent blank he fires just shows he doesn’t know what he’s talking about but simply has deeply vested interests which are threatened. Now he’s just become the boy who cried wolf - nobody in crypto cares about him.

Congrats on being exposed to all this back in 2014 and actually seeing a diamond in the rough before it was plastered all over the news. You’re one of the lucky ones. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:15:18
Appreciate that. I sure hope so. I think the strangest difference between stocks and crypto is when stocks lose value it always sucks. When crypto loses value it sucks but 20% of me is kinda happy cause it’s a new potential buy opportunity. 
I believe a bull run can happen in 2019. My concern is with “bull run” fatigue. After enough false calls the larger crowd may simply lose faith. Like all the positivity eventually backfires if there’s no movement. 
All in though. We are in this for the right reasons and sound money is the right way forward. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 06:25:12
This is why getting to decentralized exchanges - binance previewed an early alpha - is so critical. Few years out.

Thanks for making this distinction between the statements. Antonopoulos is a saint. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:28:18
Great breakdown. Any links to these stats? Don’t mean to sound like a skeptic just trying to be thorough in my diligence. ��
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:09:48
Gotcha. Just a thought. Since all these major chunks of the pie chart represent single pools, and it sounds like a ton of the hardware is Antminer. If they built a backdoor into the hardware and their gear represented over 51% that could be a hazard, right?
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:26:03
Love the perspective. I agree that having skin in the game during these ups and downs has been one of the most powerful learning experiences of my financial education. 
And yes it certainly has an absorbing affect on a person. Appreciate the positivity. HODL on. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 16:45:07
Ha! Totally misread that one ☝️ 
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:06:30
That said I believe POS is a soft compromise given the trade off of massively decreased utility bills. I think there’s going to be a compelling version of PoS down the road which is decentralized and censorship resistant to enough of an extent to serve whatever purpose it is built for. 
That said I think it’s going to take quite a number of iterations and evolutions and over time it will always be  an incredibly complex evolving issue. 
Beautiful thing about BTC is it’s built to be a stupidly simple brute force giant which means it doesn’t require the insanely high level of complexity nor rate of evolution to avoid PoS loopholes. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 23:43:40
First time hearing of sigmoidal. Now you got me curious what where those numbers fall. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:31:45
Nightmare scenario is halving approaches and we go linear versus exponential. There’s big numbers to fill to go to 20k again. 
A major milestone would be getting back to ATH which I don’t see as a major obstacle. Then hitting a Trillion dollar market cap. That would be major. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:43:53
Great point to clarify. Efficiency is the name of the game.

I have no first hand experience mining. That said, I don’t think it’s to Bitmains advantage to drive out the smaller miners. If they do it’s pretty short sighted because it may induce people to trust bitcoin less and less the more centralized it becomes. 
In a weird way creeping up too much in BTC mining hashrate dominance actually shoots the giant in its own foot. Bitcoin is ingenious in that way - it’s somehow got the perfect angles on its economic incentive model. 
Obviously it’s not stopping Bitmain from creeping up right to the edge. But that’s just greed more than malicious intent, for now. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:08:13
I can see it going either way. On one hand it makes sense for Wall Street to offer an ETF *when the time is right* because ultimately it lets Wall Street take custody of the bitcoins. And in bitcoin custody is 100% ownership. So that gives Main Street an on ramp into blockchain but in true American fashion Main Street won’t actually own anything important (the keys). 
I can see the SEC rejecting it because bitcoin is not really something they can guarantee regulation on because it’s mined worldwide. And this might be a situation where it’s just more money that seeps out of American pockets if a massive collapse occurs. That could mean financial ruin for thousands of Americans because let’s face it, we aren’t that savvy with financial decision making. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 05:45:20
Uhh... this was an absolutely awesome share. Anyone else hiding old gems?
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:25:31
True. In our Keynesian society when the spending stops its a death wish. So I can envision some point post Trump when the house of cards falls. Stocks fall, job loss, etc. that’s a point in which suddenly movement of money can go stale. And I also see that as a big potential opening for crypto to on ramp for the masses. 
America is like a great white shark. We need constant money flowing through our veins to keep us alive. So if all other channels start to falter, crypto may become the go to artery. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:19:03
BAKKT cannot do anything to affect the technology of Bitcoin but if it goes badly and lots of citizens have money tied up in BAKKT and they screw the pooch that negative PR may spill over to mainstream perception. 
BAKKT is great because it’s planned to be a true custody solution. But again, it’s always sketchy when people “buy bitcoin” and don’t have the key ��. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:12:22
I think this would be disastrous for the short term price as most people would likely liquidate their positions or Coinbase might freeze accounts until further notice (hence take control of your keys). But it would for sure strengthen Bitcoin in the long term as it would only prove that it persists regardless of government intervention.
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:15:32
Agree with your first sentence except the strictly scarce resource bit. I get the sense BAKKT is not exactly a purely benevolent second layer. 
Listen to Laura Shin’s latest Unconfirmed podcast. It talks about BAKKT and fractional reserve lending. If banks sit in front of Bitcoin they can do whatever they want. The biggest issue is people do not own their keys because they are too lazy to figure out how. 
This may increase the value of Bitcoin in the short run but when this goes back Bitcoin may be taking the blame not the banks.  
@_date: 2018-08-10 01:50:27
Appreciate the link. So technically very possible but again it all comes down to economic incentives. I suppose in some twisted reality with all this chatter about Bildeberg group from BCH crowd they have the types of resources to do that just to freak people the F out. 
Thanks again!

Awesome I’ll come check it out next time I’m getting my ��‍♂️ 
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:17:49
Yup. I think that was a typo. But I can see a bull run in the aforementioned timeframe. One of the weaknesses of Wall Street is systemic greed. It only takes one of them to break the lines and go in for the rest to create a bull stampede.
Let’s hope their greed and our patience mix in 2019. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:17:01
Agreed. But if I’m in Turkey and this continues. I might want to drop a % of my bank account into crypto. We just need a few % for all these countries. 
Crypto has a funny way of being a door that once people walk through for the first time then the research and understanding tends to follow. We need more of that behavior. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:09:16
Very interesting. Thanks for the TLDR. Any general timeframes? I’m out of the loop with BCH and just now catching up. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 16:47:03
What major events / milestones do you see happening before we move out this phase and into the next?
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:52:09
Hah. The word YET is implicit in this message. If I was BAKKT I would release the same statement. They’re smart.
Watch, give it time. And in retrospect this reads more like “hey guys we’re planning to do this in the future but we need you to buy in today so here’s a good one liner” ��. 
All good though because BTC is still layer 1.

I read the Time Preference chapter yesterday and that concept alone changed the way I think about people who make “bad” financial decisions. I’ve always been a saver by nature but now the spenders make more sense to me because the fiat money is designed to incentivize spending now. And people have children to take care of them in the future but the time preference is so high today that there is no sense of a future so why have kids. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 08:08:01
True, but time will reveal the false claims of the 99%. Once these 2nd layer solutions arrive (hoping we'll see some in 2019) and that will help cement the value of the foundational coins. I'm really looking forward to seeing these developments and can see BTC and ETH prevailing.
BTC primarily because it's so far ahead regarding hashrate and I don't believe more than on PoW is necessary since it does consume so much electricity (still a small price to pay for immutable trust). 
ETH I see succeeding because Vitalik is a boss but also it attracts the majority of blockchain developers giving it the deepest community which typically leads to the most innovation and scale.
@_date: 2018-08-19 16:52:47
Congrats. Keep growing that stack. Don’t worry bout the clownin. One day that’ll be 1 BTC and you’ll feel just as accomplished as then as you did today.

@_date: 2018-08-19 16:54:27
Curious every time I see one of these charts where the data comes from? I’d love to believe it’s honest and accurate but is there a foolproof way of collecting this?
@_date: 2018-08-10 05:25:29
So they make the ASIC hardware and let others mine. They sell the shovels rather than mine the gold. Which is more predictable and lower risk. Actually makes a lots of sense from an Asian mindset. But they still got skin in the game by mining on the side. 
To your point because their chips will eventually go out of date it’s too much to risk to do all the mining themselves if they risk going out of date suddenly. 
I’ll check sources but I can recall Antonopoulos referring to some of what you’re saying. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:36:08
I’m waiting as well. And willing to wait for a decade. But something unique to bitcoin is its tendency to bring out my weak inner petulant greed demon. 
Despite the downward price spiral the silver lining is the hashrate is incredible and the technology is slowly taking root in small pockets around the world. Time is our enemy in the short term and our friend in the long. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:01:00
Can you elaborate on that? My interpretation is you mean how centralized the development team is? Please correct me if I’m wrong. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:06:50
Well said. As this industry matures there will be more obvious spaces for everyone to get involved. Give it time and stay positive.
@_date: 2018-08-20 06:23:34
True. I certainly believe there can be blockchain projects which have value. We’re all eagerly waiting for that killer app to arrive. That will change everything. I think a great one on the horizon is the decentralized exchange. 
That said, I’d challenge any “Blockchain not Bitcoin” people to explain why not Bitcoin, where the need is greatest. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:16:21
I like the sentiment. Part of where this hits a wall is US (assuming we are here) businesses and government transact in USD. So small communities can start adopting in small pockets where it is recognized a fair medium of exchange but things have a tough way of always flowing back to the government. 
Sure if there’s an apocalypse BTC may do a hostile takeover. But I’m sure not hoping for that, that’d be hell on earth. Somehow some way our new dry world needs to link up with the old wet world for things to really start clicking. 
We have more to gain in cooperation than in fighting. This is a lesson we’ve still not mastered after thousands of years. Stronger together, *them included*.

@_date: 2018-08-10 15:21:48
Agreed. But anyone from tech can share stories of awesome technologies losing out to inferior solutions because of poor marketing. 
99% of the world does not care how well Facebook is engineered in the back end. 99% of people act on emotion and leave with impressions based on what others say, think, and feel.
Bitcoin is an incredible work of art. But do people understand it? No. It’s a question of how skewed people’s perception of it becomes like a game of telephone that determines its success. Hoping it stays closest to the truth cause it’s a banger. 
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:14:46
I have a lack of technical know how on how this would be implemented but in theory it sounds awesome.
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:56:43
Is path of least resistance / laziness the reason no one started one in the US or is it because China’s pool is intrinsically tied to Antminer’s ASIC? Thanks for the knowledge drop. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:32:59
Why is it that all the largest mining pools are in China versus other countries with low electricity costs? Bear in mind I’ve never setup a mining node. Why can’t the US setup a huge mining pool? 
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:52:22
Is there any particular reason the US doesn’t have a large mining pool? It sounds like anyone from anywhere can join so how come it’s so heavily concentrated? I’d have expected Europe and USA to have decently sized pools. 
@_date: 2019-11-04 23:43:26
In these early days, any effort like this is commendable as it is pioneering uncharted territory. Bugs are a constant in development so to point the finger at that is to stare at the cracks in the wall forgetting entirely that you’re staring at the Pyramid of Giza. It’s incredible to see new possibilities on the network and for all on lookers of this may it open minds and provide fuel for new works and applications.
