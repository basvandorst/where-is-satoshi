Have you been to China? Their cashless payment systems are way more advanced and established than in most other countries worldwide, even without crypto. Mainly because it is much easier to keep control over people if they do not have anonymous cash to hide and spend...

Factom for example is a project to store data inside the blockchain which would be unhackable. American homeland security is interested and partnered up. 
Modum is producing temperature sensors with blockchain connection for pharmaceutical companies to make sure that their products have always been kept at required temperatures during transport. Tamper proof.
Vechain is doing similar with cheap chips to be included into products like baby food, fashion products etc. with blockchain connection to make sure that you buy legit products and not fakes.
Val:ID is a new switzerland ICO and they plan to have your national ID transferred to a blockchain to use it safely for identification online without being hackable or having to fear that someone is tampering with it. Also did already a prototype test session in a province in switzerland which went quite well.
And then DApp providing blockchains like Ethereum, Neo and Co. might do quite well in the future as service providers.
There are a lot more interesting projects out there. Out of this 1.500+ Coins available now 99% will die. That much I agree, but there will be great projects surviving.

Money laundering hurts no one? You know where this money is from, right? Theft, blackmailing, drugs, prostitution, environmental crimes and about any other kind of illegal activities. And of course the society and economy in which this money is "earned" is hurt by it. As we are all.

"Absorbed quickly?" They only sold a few tens of thousands Bitcoin over months and they sent the whole market down. They have enough to do so until end of 2018...

Sorry to say, but using loan money to invest into a highly volatile and risky market is about as dumb as it can get.

Even though the news is not bad by itself, Malta has a very bad reputation within Europe when it comes to money. Money laundry, connection to russian state and russian mafia (which is about the same), gambling etc. This is not exactly a partner you would proudly present.

The fact that the whole market can still be crushed with such a - in comparison to other markets - low volume is a bearish sign in itself. There is just way too low liquidity and volume in the market. In combination with cryptocurrencies being near zero public interest (again) in Google social media analysis means cryptocurrencies have backed out of the mainstraim again for the time being, so no flood of new money in the near future...

They will co-exist. And there will be very sucessful altcoins solving problems that Bitcoin can not even dream of. Why does it always have to be black and white for you guys. That is not how the world is, just stop daydreaming.

Always gives me a bit of the chills, if people like Draper who are big promoting players in Bitcoin are shouting out nutty ideas. Kind of insults the whole project.
