I don't follow this, is not profitable to mine right now, wasn't the purpose of the net to allow the little guy some fighting shot? Wouldn't I have the same probability of mining than 100 rigs working for the same guy? I thought that the mining process mutated to allow for every one to have the same shot at earning the coin...
Please help me understand this since that's what I got from reading the white paper thanks!

I wanted to look for a place like this/build one, I thought that every project should have a reviewing fee and a work fee this way some one else gets in the middle of the transaction and reviews the job before paying the worker and as long as the worker doesn't receive his payment neither the employer gets his project nor the reviewer gets payed, the reviewer should be some one that has to proof they know how to do the project and understands what has been requested... But the reviewer selection should be random to guarantee no deals between the reviewer and the worker...
I don't know how to fix the problem some one smarter than  me probably has already, if you warrantee that I'll get paid, I can build you any type of quantitative marketing research study, both online wherever you want it or face to face here in Mexico, this includes the data gathering, building the questionnaire to your brief'requirements, data processing and analysis and if you pay for the trip we can do a live presentation, we can work in English, Spanish or Portuguese.
So yeah hit me up please I need the money to invest more and build a future for both my wife and I =3

Ok but I'm loosing credibility here, let me explain, people don't give a shit about how money works, about how the government works about anything and they don't care... Ever since I entered and started reading whenever I ask how anything works, people even get angry like talking about that stuff is pointless, boring, wrong... They don't want responsibilities, they just want to go by life without questioning nothing...
First off they don't care, secondly the transfer times in this time and age... It's just not practical...  Mining centralization and every hacked exchange... All that etf and future talk noise, but bitcoin still has yet to be manipulated when a lot of smarter eyes than your average lolo's are looking at every inch of the code... That's trust... 
I'm shocked since I saw the US govt questions to Mr Zuckerberg... Electing Trump made me question the state of the United States but the Facebook issue... Omg they don't know what Facebook even is! How it works, what it does...
I'm going to keep buying crypto because I don't want to miss out, I'm not expecting to get rich I'm saving for the bleak future wherever I can and crypto takes, what I consider as lost money with a lot of hope, but shit am I scared of how the future looks like...

I don't feel selfish, nor mediocre, I just know that I can't give the kid the life I'd have loved... Either he won't see me often cuz I'm always at the office or, if I get a lot of money, I'd send him overseas to get the best education, so... Why have a kid? I'm even considering adoption, if I get enough money, as you say my intent would be to help people with said money, create for example a house maid app with heavy profiling and honorable salaries for the ladies, rally care for the employees and protect the property of the clients is one of my ideas... I don't know man the more money I have I also see that from down below everyone tries to get you in a bad way, the gov wants its share, the neighbour's even you own blood will attack you because you haven't helped them.... Having a lot of money sometimes sounds as bad as having just enough...

I'm not following this logic here, you want a decentralized system until this happens to you, everyone is a genius with cold storage until something goes wrong... If a decentralized system worked the we would have one... It's because one day some decided to take something that it wasn't theirs and some one more powerful took revenge via what we call law in the best scenario, responses like oh too bad you are just dumb are like calling a mother dumb because she left her kid go to school alone and a psycho killed her kid...
Looking for a bounty hunter is the first step until enough people loose and start demanding their governments to fight their fights in a civilized manner cuz that's why they pay taxes...
I don't know I just read a lot of sadness here... Truly sorry for your loss man, the money you've lost in my hands would make a great change and in some people I directly know would have made an even greater change, we do learn when we fall but some losses are just to hard, I hope you fare well from this and come out a better man...

@_date: 2018-08-11 08:16:09
This is what I think, could be wrong tho, please do tell me if I am. 
If I smash a dog on your face you'd see nothing but hair and balls and you'd scream right?
On the normal scale you see exactly that; you get scared of that big 75%, because of this fear, you decide to sell based on emotions and because of looking just too close you get wrecked in the long run. You felt fear of loosing x ammount of money because you've already lost 75% of what you had in the first place and take out your 25% left, and from your response I'd guess you'd probably spend it on something harmful to your health... So yeah not cool... 
Now let's pull that dog out of your face and now you see that it's just a cute puppy and you kinda don't mind those balls in your face now because let's be real here, your memory sucks, you forget about pain just too fast, in 1 year you will forget about half of what you did, and even what you do remember, the sensation you felt at that moment is dampened by time, since it does heal everything.
Because you see the history you could re invest 25% of what you initially invested, if it rockets up again and you add no more to the pile, you only get back to where you started; but that's only if it's money you don't mind loosing, this is, after all, a game, and you have everything to loose since you have a laughable amount of points to gamble against what the big players have; Past trends do not explain the future consequences unless you speak of fundamentals... And that is what you need to evaluate, did you get out because fundamentally, your investment got crushed? Or because you couldn't handle some balls to your face? This scale is just for that, it wouldn't be used if it wasn't helpful you are just illiterate, because of your ignorance you attack, you should approach life with curiosity instead, and ask for knowledge, Imho.

@_date: 2018-08-11 20:06:22
That's exactly what I'm trying not to do, in the average scale graph you do discount previous drops which can be seen here, but again I'm trying to explain to you that even tho they happened before it doesn't guarantee that it will happen again, but fundamentally it looks like it's more probable to happen again, halving incoming again, than not. Having this as background fundamental information because it fundamentally happened before, comparing to a random drop out of nowhere which didn't affect the fundamental laws we've seen stablished on this maket, then it would be in your best interest to keep cost averaging what you can afford to loose as the benefit against a calculated risk is better than keeping your inflationary Fiat.
Following your logic then you should trade all your USD to mxn as per shown here  And I wouldn't ever recommend that... Because fundamentally the USD is stronger and even tho some times the other currency gains a nice percentage, the fundamentals still are in place...

I've been reading, a lot, like you will, and found about indexes; I have no more money to spend on this dream, but maybe, you should look into that, I learned that spreading is better the hard way and informing yourself the best way to divide  the share of spread you need to balance is a must.

Wife and I have been living 1 year together now, Tis been awesome but eye opener, this and crypto have made me realize how fucked up we are... I don't want kids, this world doesn't deserve raising a newborn... 
Living with the wife made me realize as well that the economy works because of women... They are in control of everything... If not for women we would be scratching our sack and smelling our hands afterwards all day long... They drive us to do unbelievably stupid shit in order to get them this new bag that I just neeeeeeed! Lol well she could say the same about my legos I guess.... 
Besides my dad I really don't care about my family... The wife has indirectly teached me on this grounds with hers, and now I question how I've treated the rest of my family my whole life... I couldn't care less about them and I'm reevaluating atm, but I have friends, I explained them that this could go to hell but it really sounded like the future...

Second this, you are going to loose value with a high possibility of it being permanently, invest only what you can afford to loose, this is both literally and psychically... 
Another nice rule is don't invest if you have any kind of debt, deal with that first.
And never invest in something you don't understand, I struggle with this one, I've certainly broken it as well as apparently 90% of this subs... I guess this is the important one seemingly no one follows it and I guess that's what separates the winning side... So I keep reading.... There's a shit ton to read o... O

That's what baffles me, let's say Satoshi starts dumping, or  not him but another whale account, it could crash the market in a second, so decentralized... Mining afaik is not profitable for your average Joe or needs a heavy capital investment, transfer of value cannot be stopped in any way but it will leave a permanent record which can be traced back with an exact time stamp and God knows that if you have the money you can find out anything in this world... So... I don't know....
In contrast the wealthiest wallets are not dumping, the golden bag has not been breached which baffles me.... Everyone's got a price but people on this thing have made... Generational wealth is an understatement... And they are holding! Why o. O

@_date: 2018-06-13 19:45:33
I'd argue that it is far easier to get in, you need your passport, get verificated, do a wire and purchase.
Here comes the average people issues:
Get it out of the exchange, you need a wallet and from what we've seen it needs to be generated on a never connected to the internet pc if you really want to be sure the private keys are yours, if you go virtual machine route then you need a clean windows, Linux os installation so yeah....
You could go app wallet, but would you transfer your own cash to an app which promises you that it won't get your money, oh but you can read the code it's open source, yeah but do you understand the code?
Using it, no one accepts crypto, you'd need a hot wallet which means getting coins from your hard wallet which at the moment you transfer anything from your hard wallet using the private key if you are really cautious then you need to create another hard wallet... For me this will mean getting paid each 15 days, transferring the money online to the exchange, getting new coins creating another hard wallet to merge the previous balance plus my payroll new coins, leaving some on my hot wallet and probably 7 days after re charging my hot wallet which makes me create a new hard wallet it's just crazy... 
 I hardly use cash and I live in Mexico and my peers and even younger people are against using credit cards or online transfers, do not even think about older people, I just had my credit card cloned 3.months ago and I'm still suffering the consequences, all the money WILL get back to me but each transaction takes 40.days to get resolved and if you report it before it gets really charged to the card then when charged you need to start a new process, you could not pay the overall amount asked but then it generates new charges on fees and stuff for not clearing the balance and you need to file new reports, it's a pain! People are really afraid of getting their hard earn money lost by wrongly capturing a debit card for an online transaction (and we now have picture capturing....) now think about all the private keys needed to Live every day with crypto as it is today its just crazy... 
Now as a store of value? Sure no problem one hard wallet and you keep adding to it with no need to create another one every 7 days, untill we have something which dinamically creates a shit ton of "daughter" wallets on the fly when creating the "mother" hard wallet and everything is done on the back end, and transferring small amounts of value from this "mother" vault to your phone wallet to do everyday transactions ensuring that there's no way to loose either your hot nor your hard wallet's coins then there's no future here imho and even then, only people who now are 35 or younger will enroll in this new system, older average users will want debit credit (if those use crypto they don't care nor want to know) and even older hard old cash... 
@_date: 2018-06-17 11:55:19
But it's not moving... Why hold one of the biggest bags ever and not even take a monthly share of the pie... Start using it to advance faster, I saw this pinaple trust that recently stopped working but why? We could program a trust of randomly generated wallets, sent every year to a randomly selected trust of highly acclaimed phds on their fields validated by the best universities around the world  and share these wallets for donations to be made and really push the boundaries, with the kinds of wealth in some parts of the world it's incredible that in  well planned 24 hours you could end much of the people's problems on every part of the world right? This Is the value of decentralization? Our generation acknowledging that our parents have been playing a loosing game against clever people who stablished an apparently  unbreakable status quo and almost all of the administrative jobs are the real bubble? We pay the salaries of people who are good at making us believe they got their shit straight when in reality don't even know how Facebook works? And we give them the keys to nuclear missiles!

I'm thinking on behavioral economics, the way it works and the narrative behind up until now is digit gold, I'd think that a nice estimation would be comparing it with gold ath and going backwards, I also was checking out property being sold for btc against an expected 30 40 50 percent margin profit being calculated on the price of selling the property but then I saw that they are instantly morphing back to Fiat the second you transfer them the value, still some one is buying the btc at the same moment back.... Which confuses me.... They are not taking it directly but some one else is... Why? 
@_date: 2018-06-17 10:39:07
Question... From what I've seen now a new patch? Is released and you choose to move to the new... Version or not? What's the difference between this and a hard fork? Are you able to decide not to switch to the new version and you btc can still be traded? If a backdoor is placed and no one notices it for God knows we don't read enough and even so 99% of the people who took the time wouldn't understand 1% of the code.... Wouldn't it crash everything? If some one with enough btc moves to another version wouldn't everyone follow suit without even questioning it like a herd?
Thanks for your help probably I'm wrong even from the start of my train of thought...

True question, let's say tether tanks with bfx, everyone and their mother before the actual crash will want to sell their tether to get X coin, some of that share would be bitcoin, so in theory we would see a pump on bitcoin then news bfx fraud and then a tank in btc right? Or. Could it happen in some other way

So... Can the difficulty be adjusted to produce a block every 5 minutes? Why 10 minutes?
@_date: 2019-04-28 22:34:01
Wouldn't market adjust itself? A big power investing to get all of those fees lowering the price of each transaction for example?
@_date: 2019-04-28 23:59:31
Ok so... Mining is difficult but as more transactions get in the difficulty doesn't adjust on the easy side? Or the price doesn't get more distributed, To incentivice more miners to get in? Or one to harness power?

Ok I'm most probably wrong here... As I understand it I kind of publish I want to send some btc, and ad a reward for someone to re broadcast my message to the network? So there's some guy who will choose to broadcast my message and will earn that fee? So I thought of some one taking all the cheap fees first, going against the logic of taking the urgent more juicy fees available which are clogging the writing on the ledger...

This is just top of my head and probably not too well thought out, but I guess in your situation I'd go straight to buying property, maybe 2 properties somewhere like in Cancun  and rent them out, with the Monthly income I'd re invest some on crypto, some on stocks and some for a retirement account in Fiat and just keep on living... Truly happy for you man ;) hope everything goes awesome for you!

No source at all, didn't stated it as a fact either... it's a possibility, also we are discussing a leak so I didn't knew official sources were mandatory... Since Samsung is already involved in payments with Samsung pay plus this leak, it's not too far-fetched to think they would involve themselves more, if the gate of trust has opened and people have crossed it and there's money to be made as well as data to be gathered...

So... Is there an android app which generates and stores the keys on the device? I read that samourai was not to be trusted since their servers code cannot be audited? So I took my btc back to the exchange... Every proof of keys should come with an easy to use wallet for pc, Android, iOS etc manual... I've been looking at the hard wallets but read as well that some are compromised even before selling them.... Also they are expensive (for me anyways) This is just too hard for Adoption... 
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:58:17
As far as I understood it, when you broadcast a transaction you are not sure if, on their end everything gets unencrypted and your private key becomes exposed? Something along those lines...?
In my tin foilness I got scared of the keys event and thought that if the herd was taking out the coins the safer way was to hold on the exchange... I know silly xD

@_date: 2019-01-06 06:20:03
I recently uninstalled the app because I read that the code running on their servers isn't open source which makes it prone to be maliciously intended... I haven't gotten to reading more about it, while I do I thought my coins were better on the exchange but I loved the idea of holding the coins on my phone like I do with toast wallet...
Can anyone give me peace of mind about this? I want to own my keys...

Not your private keys not your crypto, this is something you should do by yourself after reading a lot, you could loose everything you place into this without trusting no one, the probability of loosing everything increases by a lot if you trust somebody else, the beauty of the system is that you have to trust no one...

DRM with cryptos, the software has a wallet embedded and a a token is sent between the wallet and the company wallet to check if it's a valid copy, as far as I've read a transaction doesn't take to. Much bandwidth which won't hamper the online experience. I.e. You have your Nintendo wallet with a token for zelda, Mario kart and some other games which validates true ownership of the license so you can download the game and play it.

I'm not saying I'm the guy but hear me out, get your money to another country, build and mine there, partner up with a guy, follow the legal procedures required and build at some Latin American country where everything is way cheaper, security, the local, the electricity.
