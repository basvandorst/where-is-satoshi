Oh i follow you now, i didn't know about box plots so didn't question it, yeh i understand the basic concept of a candelstick, but the pattern OP had found in that comment was something i was more intrigued in, the 20% swing.... what specifically they were looking at.
Thanks though, at least my comment opened your own eyes to something anyway, could have been problematic.

Hey, i've just started reading candles, could you elaborate on what you're looking at so i can understand more, i can see that you've got i set at half hour intervals and each block is 5 minutes, the swing that you speak of....? 
I don't get.

Get him to create an account on Gemini, the amount of transactions on Coinbase that have fucked up and the lack of transparency and shambles of a complaints department makes them unreliable as fuck.
Look into it, i'm really just skimming the surface, also Coinbase seem to be a propagator of the segwit2x idea, which is worrying.
