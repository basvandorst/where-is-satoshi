I agree. I was trying to imply that gold's popularity as a store of value comes from several qualities in which its long history as a medium of exchange is not the least.
If Bitcoin is able to hold its desirability as a store of value or even rise depends a lot on its utility as whole. When axing some of its actual and potential utility one has to be ready to sacrifice some of its value.

Why was such change implemented in the first place?

Late Roman Empire was a (Orthodox) theocracy, the Emperor was the supreme authority in both church and state.
Actually the Catholic Church was born from the East-West schism of 1054, when the Empire was losing its influence in Italy and the Pope sought to increase his power.
All churches are of course founded by men, not god.

Earliest depictions of weighting gold in exchange for goods are from fourth millennium BC Egypt. We don't know if it was used before this, because that's pretty much how far written history goes.
Also its use as jewelry comes from this. It became a convenient method for showing off ones wealth and social status.
@_date: 2015-12-12 11:43:39


Gold was used as a proto-money (people were trading items priced in gold) in Egypt atleast from 3000 BC. You're right in that it wasn't a currency, which means government circulated money (from latin currere).
Gold was very useful as a medium of exchange due to its rarity and divisibility. This meant that there was always demand for it and as a result it became a good store of value. Much of its modern store of value derives from this long history as a money, which keeps its perceived value high.
Every child knows that gold is valuable, yet some rarer metals with higher industrial demand like rhodium are almost unknown to general public. (and relatively not as expensive) This has very much to do with the history of gold. If ancient Egyptians traded and hoarded rhodium instead, you'd probably be a rhodium bug right now.
@_date: 2015-12-12 16:01:55
Rhodium is rarer than gold and has very desirable chemical properties (non-oxidizing, high melting point etc.). There is more uses for it in industrial applications than for gold. However it doesn't have the same history as gold in money/display of wealth so it's perceived value among general public is lower than that of gold. Much of gold's current value is simply psychological baggage that derives from its past use.

I think you've nailed it.
I'm so tired of incessant and unconstructive ad-hominem threads here, that I decided to take a break from r/btc. Maybe this is the unavoidable result of the on-going schism. That said, I'm not going  to r/bitcoin as I think that any cesspool is better than a place, where important topics like cannot be discussed freely.

Maybe you should re-read the whitepaper.


valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. **Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.**
@_date: 2016-03-08 04:09:21


That's a framed question where you already put in the answer you expect.
 In the past people had no choice but to run a full node if they wanted to use Bitcoin. Light/mobile Bitcoin clients just didn't exist. Now they do so people who only use the wallet feature aren't going to run a full node and they won't even if you decreased the blocksize limit to 0.5 MB.
[EDIT] although my account is new I've been following Bitcoin since 2011 and invested in early 2013.
@_date: 2016-01-12 11:42:09
Well, the whitepaper says that all necessary rules are enforced by the software that the network runs.
But it seems like the owners of Bitcoin.org would like to define these rules instead.

Who are brigading these threads? Brigading means that people who don't belong into the community (Bitcoin community in this case) get together to rate threads and posts.
What is motivation of anyone not using Bitcoin to come and rate here?
I think that its normal Bitcoin users that vote these threads. You can't call it brigading simply because the majority disagrees with you.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:25:18
But what majority hashpower runs (longest chain) is Bitcoin. Well, that's how I understand it anyway.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:30:45
So basically you're saying that hard forks should not happen?
How is this enforced?

Yes, I will. I think it was mistake to come here.

They just want to make an example of Coinbase so that others think twice before supporting forks. Either they are heroes or thugs, you choose.

There is two sides to it and neither can remedy the situation completely. The damage is done.
1.Either the community decides to freeze/revert/blacklist the "stolen" coins and/or bails out DAO investors, which as a result will undermine some trust in ETH core principles as outlined on the main web page:
*"Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference."*
2.The community decides to do nothing. DAO investors are hurt, attacker might dump on the market causing a temporary price crash, but ETH as whole stays true and trusted as a platform with no third party interference.
Both positions have their merits and drawbacks. The conclusion will define Ethereum for a long time to come.

They split before SegWit triggered, because they want to preserve a chain without SW.
I think there are many of us who view Bitcoin Cash as a back-up plan, that only becomes relevant if 2x part of NYA agreement fails or if SegWit has some unforeseen issues.

I find it surprising how governments in countries like China or Russia aren't funding something like this and instead are content in providing a spying vector for US intelligence by using AMD and Intel CPUs.
Maybe it's just usual government incompetence.

We understood that much
However it doesn't mean that you need to call people scumbags when they only want to help Bitcoin to evolve (right or wrong). Try to stay civil when expressing your concerns and maybe people will give them more thought.
@_date: 2016-02-20 15:59:01
I agree and apologize for the kneejerk reaction of mine.
I don't think anyone is evil here. Everyone probably does what they think is best for Bitcoin, right or wrong.
@_date: 2016-02-20 14:53:56
It is good.
I still hope that decision making in Bitcoin would be less centralized. That's what we need multiple competing implementations for. I don't want any single entity acting as a gatekeeper for the reference code.
@_date: 2016-02-20 15:08:14
...and discussion about competing implementations is completely open. wait...no, they are hijacking the Bitcoin and should be banned.
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:41:37


No "we" don't. We want decentralization and think that a larger network (more users) would help that. With more business using Bitcoin, there will be more parties which benefit from running a node.
Not only read, but also write access to the ledger needs to be cheap in order to attain that. If you make write access prohibitively expensive (high fees), then what good is having cheap read access (bandwidth requirements)? IMO what we need is to balance costs and keep the main chain accessible to widest user base possible.

It's not about profit. Profit is only means, the end is power.
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:43:32
If it's profitable to attack, then there's something wrong with incentives of the system.
Bitcoin works on the assumption that miners do whatever profits them most.

Come on, the guy was a principal software engineer and open source evangelist at Red Hat for over 10 years.
You are basically saying that Red Hat hired and kept some incompetent dude for developing and maintaining low level Linux kernel stuff - which isn't a simple feat - for all that time. Calling Jeff a sub par developer simply doesn't add up. 
I guess you have to find some other way of dissing him if you want to remain credible.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:46:16
Yeah, that brings up a good point about censorship resistance.
Google has power to manipulate views of web users by simply arranging/limiting search results. What Google doesn't show ceases to exist. I can use Duckduck.go or Startpage, but that doesn't really change the big picture.
Maybe same could be said about Bitcoin if mining gets (some argue it already is) too centralized. If Bitcoin's built-in incentives can't keep miners honest, then the whole system is broken.

Someone else also censors, therefore we shouldn't talk about censorhip here.
What kind of logic is that?
[edit]I think this just goes to show how poisonous and tribal this manufactured division has become. Lack of open discussion has damaged this community beyond repair and given the stage to extremists and scammers like CW.

And why am I "trying to catch non tech savvy users into the trap."?

@_date: 2017-07-16 16:59:56


Of which Satoshi said:










[edit]I guess the problem is that people have different ideas about the "original Bitcoin". Is it the one outlined by Satoshi or something that emerged after he left the project (where a fee market and limiting on-chain tx would be pursued). Satoshi believed that Bitcoin would scale on-chain. Maybe he was wrong, but then, who is right, which idea should we follow?
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:30:01
Now, everyone here who has followed me knows I strongly advocate in favour of decentralization first, and therefore in favour of *lifting the blocksize limit.* :P
Question for you small blockers. Do you think that the www is less decentralized now than it was in the 90s? Is there less reason to run a web server? 
The economy has grown, servers have moved from homes and universities to datacenters and as a result of that huge growth the web is more decentralized than ever.
The same would happen with Bitcoin. More on-chain usage means more businesses that benefit from running nodes. It's part of the design, see: 


[edit] To the OP. Are you implying that people who don't agree with your views are liars? Gavin, Jeff, Jihan, Mike etc. all just lying and part of some big conspiracy to take over Bitcoin? If so you're no better than conspiracy theorists on that other sub. Have you ever thought that maybe their vision of Bitcoin is just different from yours (see for example: I think that decentralization and security comes with growth of on-chain usage.) We might disagree, but I'm telling what I believe to be the truth. Instead of fighting like little kids maybe it's time to just agree to disagree and part our ways. You follow the UASF fork and I follow whatever fork that lifts the blocksize limit. Everyone is happy.
@_date: 2017-07-03 03:46:32
Is there some good sources that could convince otherwise people like me who have come in conclusion that Bitcoin needs to keep growing on-chain to keep its economic incentives working?
Technical details really don't help, because the disagreement is not technical but that of economic design.
An implementation can be perfectly coded, the code can be more efficient, but if it alters incentives and fundamental properties of the system, then I think one has to make a very good case for it.
In 2009-2015 we saw that the design by Satoshi more or less worked. It has proven itself. What we haven't seen is that this system will work when the main chain is capacity is intentionally limited and most of the traffic happens on a 2nd layer with fundamentally different properties. I think this needs to be proven without a doubt before we alter the system in ways that cannot be easily reversed.
@_date: 2016-07-02 04:43:30
I don't usually contribute on this side of the fence, but I just wanted to say it's somewhat disingenious to make such blanket statements about the r/btc userbase and content.
There are people like you mention, but they are a vocal minority. You already mentioned how they ended up in r/btc and that's true,  but also many smart, decent, well behaving members of the community who didn't share the views taken by r/bitcoin leadership on Bitcoin scaling were forced to leave due to being silenced.
It's fair to give a balanced (good and bad) view to reader and not only present one side of the issue.
@_date: 2016-07-17 08:36:07


Agreed. 
Would you mind posting the source for reference?


Not true. See:
 *&lt;theymos&gt; You must be naive if you think it'll have no effect. I've moderated forums since long before Bitcoin (some quite large), and I know how moderation affects people. Long-term, banning XT from will hurt XT's chances to hijack Bitcoin. There's still a chance, but it's smaller. (This is improved by the simultaneous action on bitcointalk.org, bitcoin.it, and bitcoin.org)*
Google and you find the original source of that quote or PM me. I'll avoid linking so this isn't automatically moderated.


I've never had any of my posts about r/bitcoin censored on r/btc. (or any other posts for that matter). To be fair, I think r/bitcoin is discussed too much over there. Many people who were banned posting here end there and complain about their bans.
