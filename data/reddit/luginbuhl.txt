they mined at 6 cents because it was profitable. 2k, with the difficulty and hashpower that's out there, literally every miner will be turned off. Which will decrease the difficulty to a point where miners can jump back in at the difficulty adjustment. It's possible to mine at 2k, but only after a LARGE difficulty correction. Then china will hold ALL the hashpower as they'll be the only ones to cover the power AND make a few pennies a day. 2k bitcoin kills the bitcoin. period.

I've got the same thing 20 min down the road. except i made sure that every machine is remotely accessible. how the hell did you have your trade bot inaccessible but the miners were? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:56:33
I also mine shitcoins and get paid in bitcoin. I also have a bunch of antminers. Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment system is archaic compared to the newer shitcoins that adjust difficulty every block. 
When your shitcoins value in BTC drops to the point where your GPUs are burning away power and not making enough BTC to sell for the power, you're in trouble. You could continue to mine and collect your BTC, while paying the power bill and just holding in hope.
You cant really compare asic mining to GPU mining shitcoins. the shitcoins value flows with BTC for the most part. 
I'll bet if you checked whattomine today your daily take is ~40% what it was a few days ago. 
People don't really understand that BTC props up most shitcoins. There's a few outliers, but for the most part, you need BTC to be healthy to be successful with your GPU mining. 
I absolutely KILLED it in 2017 with GPU mining. I was up to 48 1070s at one point, then i sold a lot of them for 100 dollars more than i paid for them.

I use keepass to keep track of all my cold wallets. The keepass file is saved on Dropbox. Since this event i also save them as a PDF on a disconnected External Hard Drive. 
Best i can figure is that i saved it in KeePass after i made it and that night the power went out. I came back to the computer and it had shut off. 
When i discovered i didn't have the key a week after generating the wallet i remembered we had lost power overnight a week back, so that's how i made the assumption. 
It could be something WAY stupider, but I've always been really good about being a good keymaster :). I never re-use wallets, etc etc.

I almost ended up on the list of preorders for a 10k BFL. i dodged that bullet. and that was my dad's money too. At least this was mine alone haha.

Aye. It’s an encrypted password manager. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:22
I did all that, trust me haha. I’ve worked in IT all my life. First thing I did when I realized I might have lost data was look for the cache file KeePass makes when it’s open and unsaved. I searched the hard drive for the deleted file and I searched dropbox (which is where the database stores). I searched my hard drives for the first four letters of the public address. Searched my email both work and personal, I even went through all my old public and private keys and tried each private key on the address just in case I changed the password to an existing entry instead of making a new one (there were 50+ private keys to try) 
Sigh.

Bitcoin has the unique position of being the first, and the one with name recognition. 
The problem with all the other alts is the sheer amount of them. The general public isn't going to come to come grand conclusion on one of them. 
Crypto's best hope is the evolving BTC (at first i didn't like lightning, but I'm a proponent now) into something that can be mass-adopted. It's only code after-all. If the people working on BTC keep pushing to make it more use-able, it will be the clear winner. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:14:01
It's the coin limit man. 21 million. forever. thats it. The more that is stockpiled by hodlers the less that's circulating. the less that's circulating the more it's worth. The more adoption there is the more demand there is for the coin. The more demand for a finite currency there is, yadda yadda yadda. If it fails, it's worth nothing. it it takes off as future money, well that 21 million number is going to be incredibly important. 
Here's how i explain it to people. Lets say BTC becomes a worldwide currency (which it arguably is already, but adoption is low and growing). Lets call that worldwide currency a dollar for arguments sake. Now lets say adoption flourishes and there's only 21 million dollars out there. You own one of those 21 million dollars. How rich are you?

Also: my sincerest condolences. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:20:24
I'm aware. You're aware that the way things are headed that fiat will likely be far less preferable to crypto right? I mean, that's why we got into this in the first place....

So hot. Would fap again. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:49:37
yeah as i said below, im in it for the long term. I'll be cold storing it in a safety deposit box and at home. I'll probably buy some more to "play" with. But i want one solid coin cold stored in case we're really on a rocket ship. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:06:04
That’s a bummer man /contrite the dude voice 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:54:29
yeah hahah i saw that. I'm not too concerned with short term, but yeah i lost a hundred to start. I'm good. If anything it's inspiring me to buy another
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:52:05
I'm prepared. As i said, Ive been following closely since around 2011, 2012. I've watched the highs, the lows, the heartbreak, the get rich quick stories. 
My mindset is that 900 off of 3000 in gambling winnings (2nd time playing craps, walked away with 3 grand), is a nice long term investment in a technology i couldn't possibly be more passionate about. bitcoin wouldn't be bitcoin in its infancy if it wasn't volatile as all hell :)
My first few months of bitcoin holding will only be unenjoyable if i were in it for fast gains. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:26:54
I guess I didn’t catch that. At least it flew under my radar

@_date: 2018-10-04 19:33:40
i don't like roger much but even I'm starting to feel sorry for him
Edit: one thing I'd like to state. This man did more for crypto than most (other than some obvious names). He earned the title bitcoin jesus and subsequently earned the title bitcoin judas. I like to think of him as bitcoin used car salesman now. It's a shame to see a fall like this. I also think there's a tinge of mental disorder in the poor guy. I don't forget the days i looked up to this guy and his principles though. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:54:57

I wouldn't really worry too much about your buy point. In that respect it's like worrying about gambling. Sometimes you're up sometimes you're down. It's the nature of it. 
What you're really hoping for is for the numbers we're seeing today, when mining is still set to continue for a good number of years (if you don't count the last 100) be laughable to you in 10 years. 
Theres two types of people in bitcoin if you ask me. Those out to make a quick buck, and those who are looking at it as a long term investment. The second mentality is where you need to be. 
The timing and cost of your initial buys will, with any hope, be a laughing matter in ten years. 
I know it's tough to see an investment go from 1200 to 200 in the span of a month or two, but you've seen the health in the growth over the last few years. Hold strong and i don't think you'll be disappointed. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:35:18
Just a little bit. I can't seem to watch the video anymore, but he says something along the lines of it being too hard for normal people to understand what it's all about, regarding the hash number he read, which is a stumbling block to its success. he basically says that it's something tech savvy people will use, but unless the masses can understand it on a technical level, they'll be wary of the people who do understand it. Then he likens it to something else, which i cant remember. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:31:43
and kinda bashed bitcoin a little bit :/
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:31:19
I think he's saying that there's a way to route TCP over UDP instead so it's not blocked by the great firewall? 
Thats magic.

would you send money to an asshat with a qr code? 
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:50:23
If you're looking 15, 20 years into the future at a possible 50 to 100 thousand dollar bitcoin, the hundreds in difference at initial investment will make you laugh. That's my only point i guess
@_date: 2017-01-14 22:31:35
it'll make you (me) feel all warm and fuzzy inside. and maybe i'll, i dunno, eat your asshole or something. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:27:06
This made me laugh out loud. lol doesn't even do it justice. Grade A bittard right here
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:09:21
yup. this.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:50:22
Oooo I hadn’t considered this. Interestingly. I do believe that yes, some money will move to the volatility. 
At that point however, I don’t see bitcoin caring as much as it does now. 
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:00:50
hahah nope. You wake up one morning and a 0 has turned into a 1 in AwesomeMiner and the Solve Difficulty Value is somewhere in the trillions. I solved a share worth something like 7.6 trillion when the difficulty was 4.8 trillion i believe.
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:04:13
Yeah it sure does look like a coin instead of a block
@_date: 2019-04-26 13:48:36
The funny part is if he hasn't solved any blocks he hasn't technically confirmed any transactions either. 
I had 18 S9's in action and the day i woke up and found out one of them solved a block i nearly fell over from excitement. 
One could argue operating a full node is helping confirm and decentralize more than a miner who hasn't solved a block
@_date: 2019-04-05 20:56:58
No one gave you an answer, instead they were mostly dicks. 
The old guy is a Block. When a block was solved at the beginning it "Threw up" 50 BTC. 
As time goes with halvenings the reward is reduced. currently blocks "Throw up" 12.5 BTC. Next year that will be cut in half to 6.25. This halvening happens approx every 4 years. This ensures that the last bitcoin of the 21 million will be mined in the year 2140 (I believe that's the year). 
@_date: 2018-03-02 03:49:49
There hasn't been a day in the passed 14 days where the place im mining on the right payout method hasn't surpassed whattomine's predicitons, very signficantly. example: one day i made 440 where whattomine predicted 150. I've got 191TH
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:01:10
This made me smile. A BIG FUCKING SMILE. 
I hope OP did some terrible shit to get that BTC, I hope Binance identified this properly and i hope this piece of shit never gains access to what I assume is illegitimately acquired funds. 
Whatever you did OP, shame on you. 
Good on you Binance for doing due-diligence in locking these funds up. 
Lawyer up asshole. If these funds are legitimate and Binance is in the wrong you'll get it back. But altering screenshots looks mighty fucking shady. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:22:04
Man. If binance reps (and trust me they’re not coming onto reddit to defend themselves without permission from high up in the exchanges governance) sit through a whole month of this dudes maligning only to post fake emails then we all have a problem FAR GREATER than this dudes 1200 BTC. 
EVERYTHING points to binance doing the right thing here and this dude doing everything in his power to make sure he never sees his funds again. 
A lawyer would have told this guy to shut the fuck up a month ago. And if he doesn’t have a lawyer helping him secure 8 million Fucking dollars, you think this is a legit claim? Come on man. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:06:31
evidence of his claims of falsely denying him access to his funds. 
Emails were exchanged as evidence that Binance locked his funds. Dude blatantly altered that evidence. 
Not LEGAL evidence. Sorry. poor choice of words. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:51:15
I don't think i spoke out of turn here. 
Given the evidence, the altering of evidence, etc, it's likely this dude did some shady shit. I also say that if it is legitimate he'll get the funds back. 
It's been over a month, dude does nothing but complain on reddit. Has not complied with Binance's suggestions about contacting law enforcement, has not acquired a lawyer (someone with 1800 BTC can afford a lawyer so that's no excuse). 
A month ago i'd have agreed with you. It's definitely time to pitchfork up. 
Have a look at the user's posting history and how far back this bullshit goes. 
Binance rep coming in here to set the story straight is 100% the right move to do at this point. 
Here's the thing about investigations. Binance can't come forward and say "Hey asshole, here's why your funds are locked up". It's because they CANNOT do that if there's a pending investigation. 
He keeps on asking them WHY they've locked up the funds. I don't know where this person is a citizen, but the reason Binance is asking him to contact local law enforcement is because this lock is 99.9% sure coming directly FROM local law enforcement. Binance cannot tell him what he's done wrong. it's up to him to contact the law enforcement so they can properly arrest his ass. 
The reason he keeps asking is because he's fishing for information regarding how much trouble he's actually in. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:02:58
No. You'll see. By the time you see my guess is you will A: be too ashamed to come back to reddit and let us know how massively you fucked up, or B: you won't have internet access in jail 
It comes down to this. They keep telling you to contact law enforcement. You don't wanna do that. Most likely because they're pulling the strings here, you know it and you want as much info about how much trouble you're in (a.k.a. how much law enforcement has told binance) before you make that contact. 
Binance CANNOT and WILL NOT tell you how much trouble you're in or why Police are having your funds locked up. Crypto doesn't save you from the law man. 
If you did nothing wrong i hope your funds are returned to you. 
If you did something wrong this goes two ways. You contact law enforcement, they tell you why your shit's all locked up. 
From there you either resolve it and get your funds back, or you don't. 
If you don't, it's all down to what you actually did regarding whether or not you're going to see that BTC ever again in your life. 
Good luck man.

i know for pools target low BCH difficulty with their profit switchers, so it could be partly that. a block gets solved and all of a sudden, flush of hash power

@_date: 2018-11-01 22:27:19
Ok I agree with you. More little tidbits of information could be provided by binance to prove their versions of the emails are real, but I also see zero reason as to why they should be compelled to provide them. They’re the ones being attacked in literally every crypto sub on reddit. They’ve had enough of this dudes shit. 
I applaud them for sticking up for themselves 
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:06:09
thats it eh? pure chance that a block solves a few seconds after the one before it pretty regularly?

it happens SO often. seriously, go look at block charts and look at the times solved for the ones that are on the same minute. you blink and you might miss em. i figured that the nonce may be slightly manipulable or something.

I don’t see what the big deal is as long as he’s storing them properly and pays his taxes when he cashes out.
Cold storage security should be enough. 
It’s like telling a group of people you have 40k in the bank. They can TRY to get at it, but I like to think that Crypto is better in the fact that it’s probably easier to social engineer 40k out of an account rather than crack Cold storage encryption. 
10 BTC isn’t going to illicit a government inquiry. I think he should be proud of jumping into the market. Even better if he uses those coins to buy goods and services.
To OP, make sure you have your security game down tight and I don’t think you have anything to worry about :D

@_date: 2018-12-05 18:44:40
I'm still giddy over the last post you made when a Binance rep came into the post to prove you doctored emails. 
Curious, did you ever reach out to local law enforcement to figure out why they told binance to cut access to your funds? My guess is you didn't! 
Whatever illegal shit you were up to, crying about it on reddit isn't going to help you. Everyone's aware of the actions you're supposed to take, but aren't. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:14:02
this is the best guess i've seen so far. only VERY few of the people on SR got arrested.
