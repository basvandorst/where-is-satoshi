That's a pretty amiable analogy. The monopoly on money has a much more significant value than the monopoly on first class mail. 
Bitcoin will, and is already being, scrutinized. The FinCEN announcement just last week was the beginning. But isn't that part of the beauty of it?

This true and tried observation doesn't really hold true for btc seeing as how small it still really is. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:49:32
Amen to that. It's hard to see what the money says will happen.

I'm not a trader.
Surely you're not given your original post. 
No trader would ever be so naive as to think that there are people out there generous enough to give you something at a "FAIR PREMIUM." That's not how the market works. 
No trader would ever be so ignorant as to think that those with BTC, *an inherently deflationary currency*, would willingly sell their stash for some pie-in-the-sky reason. 
Unless, of course, this trader was one who thought that he could make a quick buck but soon realized that there really is no such thing as a free lunch.

I'm not sure if this is a horrible attempt at satire, or just abject stupidity. 
You're better off standing in an open field trying to stop the wind from blowing. These are growing pains--you can either recognize that or continue with your futile efforts to demand uniformity of a decentralized currency.

And he will need it because to think that BTC can compete with any major currency, let alone destroy the USD, in a year is utterly preposterous. 
For some perspective, Japan just announced a $1.4 trillion money printing extravaganza.
Bitcoin's market cap is between one and two billion dollars. 
I love the potential of Bitcoin, and truly believe in it, but many people are having downright delusions about its impact in such a short period of time.

InTrade for Bitcoin, but I have no experience whatsoever with programming. I'd love to make it a reality somehow.

I'm only twenty, so I can't give you some pre-Nam story about cargo shorts or something. 
But in my twenty short years on this blue marble, I've learned to never, ever put all of your eggs into one basket. Ever. 
EDIT: Use the btc wiki to get started learning about everything  . 
I started using btc with zero technological background, but I've been reading and doing my research. I'm still eons away from understanding cryptography and virtual currencies, but you can learn a lot form it.

I've voiced my concerns over people putting too much stock into BTC, so please don't try and play the moral high ground here.

I'd agree with you that the shouts of "WALL STREET" are premature and unfounded. They mostly come from bitter folk who thought they could make free cash doing the day trading bit. 
I certainly experienced some schadenfreude seeing many of these simpletons be wiped out, but I feel that about anyone who really thinks that they have some crystal ball that will tell them where the market is going to be in two minutes. I happen to agree with Nassim Taleb that most trading is nothing more than sophisticated guesswork. 
What is undoubtedly true, however, is that Wall Streeter's are starting to get involved. While not an ETF, a BTC hedge fund opened up out of Malta and Coinsetter will finally make it practical and straightforward to leverage and short BTC. 
That being said, these are not your 62 year old, blue blood, Kidder &amp; Peabody holdovers. They are, however, those financial engineering nerds who know the 'Street' and technology very, very well. 
My only question is whether or not the introduction of these financial tools, especially the more exotic ones in the pipeline for down the road, will be beneficial to the establishment of BTC as a viable currency. 
Edit: And the Winklevii. Who the fuck could forget the Winklevii.

Schiff has been completely and utterly wrong about hyperinflation. He just keeps bending over backwards and saying "Oh, sometime soon...sometime soon."

Everything corrects. No telling when or by how much.

Who cares about these morons. Here's a Nobel Laureate making predictions of a similar magnitude:
"“The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in "Metcalfe's law"--which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants--becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other!” wrote Krugman. “By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.” --Paul Krugman, 1988
Oil won't be traded in btc soon, but it's also not going anywhere.

If you think that BTC can be equated with a penny stock, you have sufficiently demonstrated your ignorance. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:25:00
So did the housing boom (and in all honesty, that created boatloads more of real wealth than Bitcoin times 100). Bitcoin is not immune. 
The rise in price is too fast and too extreme. There has got to be a correction in the near future, but I'm in for the long haul.
And when the correction does happen, all of the half-assed people will abandon like there is no tomorrow. I plan on buying as many bitcoin as I can afford when this does happen.

If you think the petrodollar is going to die in two years, only then to not even be replaced by the remninbi or the ruble or even gold, you're delusional.

No, the dollar isn't collapsing. I bought into Schiff's bullshit several years ago. Year after year, the 'event' never came. He has no idea what he's talking about, quite frankly, when it comes to hyperinflation as he has demonstrated himself. 
This is a shame, of course, given how prescient he was concerning the housing bubble. But you know what they say about broken clocks, he's still got one more chance...

For the same reason Julian Assange should have remained anonymous.

I'm still very much wet behind the ears, but I've already learned this valuable lesson the hard way. 
I'm just grateful I didn't have a wife, kids and a mortgage for it.

No. No. No. 
Trading oil for BTC is still light years away, if at all.
