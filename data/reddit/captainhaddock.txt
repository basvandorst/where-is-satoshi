Young people with high risk tolerance would probably be the prime target. You might lose most of it, but you might also earn 100% annual returns.

Bread looks nice, but I'm wary to try it because it has almost all one-star reviews in the local app store, with people saying it gives errors particularly when entering paper keys.

An ETF would beneficial for people who want to hold Bitcoin in a tax-sheltered account.

Yeah, and there's a reason why CFDs are illegal in the US and some other countries. They want investors to own an asset, and not just be betting on price movement.

Assuming you hold BTC, are you using Bitflyer as your exchange?

Don't be so pedantic about what "own" means. ETFs are just a wrapper. If you buy an ETF share, you own a tiny percentage of the underlying equity or instrument, and the company managing the ETF uses the money inflows to buy more of that instrument. If you buy a Bitcoin ETF, the money goes toward buying more Bitcoin. 
The price movement of the ETF represents the price of whatever it holds. If you buy GLD, you own physical gold through an ETF. If you buy SPY, you own a fraction of stock from every company in the S&amp;P500.
Owning an ETF is *effectively* as good as owning the underlying instrument, and more convenient for many people. Most investors don't want to take physical delivery of gold or pork bellies, and they might not want to open an account on a sketchy, unlicensed and uninsured crypto exchange.


You're the one who said you didn't "understand how this works", so I was trying to explain.

Having Bitcoin in the form of an ETF would provide accessibility and liquidity, as OP's infographic explains. You could even use it to hold Bitcoin in your IRA or other tax-shielded investment account if you wanted to, and it would be federally insured against theft and bankruptcy. For the same reason, you can buy ETFs that track commodities, currencies, and other non-stock instruments.

In 2019, it'll jump 30% to $6,000!

Unless I'm mistaken, that would be considered a CFD, which is illegal in the US. It is extremely unlikely Robinhood would break the law in that manner — they would lose their license very quickly.
Edit: Further research suggests that CFDs are illegal for securities and commodities in the US, but not for forex, so maybe bitcoin is permitted.

Curiously, the name "Ferengi" comes from the word for Westerners (white Americans/Europeans) in various South Asian languages.

People still do everything with cash in Japan. My friend bought a house with cash. A literal bag full of money. When we bought ours, I had to bring a big stack of cash (thousands of dollars) to the final signing to pay the lawyer and realtor their fees.

I wouldn't say "the entire world". Google immediately set about on a complete redesign of Android. All pre-iPhone prototypes resembled Blackberries with small screens and physical keyboards. All post-iPhone prototypes resembled iPhones.
I think most tech watchers also understood the significance of the iPhone. It got a *lot* of fanfare and was an immediate success. It was mainly Balmer and the fools running Blackberry and Palm who didn't get it.

Because alt-right racists on the Internet were using the triple-parentheses to surreptitiously flag Jews in their tweets and online comments to each other, other people started adding them to their own names as a symbol of solidarity against racism.

If you short a product (bitcoin or whatever) that then increases in value, your unrealized profit is negative.
Usually, your broker or exchange requires you to have margin (cash) to cover the deficit. If your account goes broke (i.e. your position is $1000 in the red, and you only have $1000 in extra cash in your account), your broker will probably close the position automatically and take the money you owe them.
Something like this:  
1. Initial cash balance: $1000. Short 1 bitcoin at $7000. Your bitcoin position is -$7000, but your cash balance is $8000.  Overall account balance is $1000.  
2. Bitcoin rises to $8000. Your bitcoin position is now -$8000, equal to your cash. If it goes any higher, you can't pay your broker back, so they buy back the bitcoin you shorted and take your $8000. Final cash balance: $0 
You can avoid a short call by putting more cash in your account, but most traders and most algorithm-based trading systems will automatically close out the position when their loss reaches a certain level.
