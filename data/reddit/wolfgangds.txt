Can someone give me a quick ELI5 on why insider trading is a bad thing?  I've heard that it is basically all my life, but no one ever explained to me WHY it's bad.

Ah, okay. So it's to keep people from ripping off others buy selling things for huge profits at the last possible second.

I don't panic sell.  I sell when the price is high and it hasn't gone anywhere for a while.  As soon as I do, it shoots up.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:35:27
Tried that too.  Literally nothing happens.

TARDIS or GTFO.
That said, I know what I'm investing in from now on.

I've tried finding information, but none of it is helpful or in layman's terms.  I'm thankful for your suggestion, but please understand if I come across as skeptical.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:42:33
The hell does that even mean?
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:45:50
Let it work for me.  How am I supposed to do that?
