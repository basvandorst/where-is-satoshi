He believes all the shit he reads online, and by how I read stuff he is probably Schizophrenic.
He also clearly doesn't know how wealth management or how a business works.
These people believe all their delusions and blame their shortcomings on everything but themselves.

Ok, what ever you got to tell yourself to make it feel better; you will be rich one day! HODL!! 
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:34:06
Sucks to be you, all the idiots on this thread talking about HODL are just plain flat out retarded. 
This man above if he actually sold on 13k he is the only smart one, I sold at 11.5k because it was getting too crazy already, I too want it to go to around 5k to 6k~.

Yes I do, and I think you are an idiot too if you believe that. It's just a new age millennial religion.


That explains it, I'm packing up, good luck on the foodstamps.

I don't think you know what a physicist is if you mention it as a way to talk about astronomers, I bet you just watched it on a movie and refer to everything as "physicists" and "scientists". 
Anyway, nothing wrong with being a physicist" but if you believe there is some sort of  "universal energy" and that "we are all connected" then yes you are an idiot.

I'm studying my PhD in biochemistry but yeah dude, keep glorifying others success :)

It's a bit different because it only takes 1 idiot to misinterpret and start spreading about how we area all cosmic dust made from energy in the universe.

You can just hear it but the visuals are good.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:40:51
Yeah this just a little hiccup, what is nice is how fast it can recover and bounce back, good smile on the face of those that scream its death.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:03:00
Fuck no I don't watch that shit show.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:03:33
