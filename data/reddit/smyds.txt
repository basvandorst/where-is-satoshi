That is supposing enough people know and care about Bitcoin at the moment of the ban. If they banned it now, most people wouldn't even hear about it, and those who do would just think they're banning a dangerous toy for geeks and drug addicts.
In my opinion a ban would be quite bad for the Bitcoin economy, but certainly not kill it, as it will still act as a black market currency. However if they ban Bitcoin and legalize drugs, that would be the way to crash the market into oblivion.
I have a question thought. Say all exchanges are banned, and businesses aren't allowed to use bitcoins. It would still be possible to exchange bitcoins for cash in person, however the people doing this could be assumed to be involved in some kind of illegal activity. If you use something like localbitcoins, how could you know you are not setting up a meeting with a cop ? or how can you make the exchange guaranteeing the anonymity of both party ?

This motto doesn't mean anything. Evil can mean a lot of different things to different people.

This website is a great way to support free software and free software developers, but most of the bounties are in USD, lets add some bitcoins to the rewards. It's also a good way to get new people involved into Bitcoin.

Anyone would be interested in a Thunderbird extension for Bitmessage ? I think I might like to start something like this.
