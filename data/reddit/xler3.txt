'most' is a massive understatement

I absolutely love to trade bitcoin. this particular market is sooo predictable (especially if you come from forex), the probabilities of ending weeks net-plus on bitcoin is incredibly high. I’m pulling between 1-2% a week which isn’t amazing but it totally obliterates my forex numbers. 
it’s weird to come around here and see such hate for people who try to trade it. the market moves *because* people trade lol
do be careful with how much information you give though, tons of absolute pieces of shit on this website. don’t think you gave enough to warrant any paranoia but idk

i started buying in back in june right before it broke 9k. 
if you have money to play with, allot some % you can afford to lose. having skin in the game will make you keep an eye on the market, do  more detailed research, all that. personally i got about 15%~ of my total net worth in crypto with 83.13% of that in bitcoin.

gold would have yielded you 21.56% if you invested 1 year ago
btc would have yielded you 24.12% in the same time frame. not bad there
if you bought btc/xau in the past 6 months you lost money
if you bought btc/xau in 2018 you lost money
i dont know how gold can have the kind of year it just had and people say "Fuck gold." investing/trading in gold this year made you a great deal of money. you can buy both you know
the cherry picked data points are irrelevant.
