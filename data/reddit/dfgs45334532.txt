people can continue solo-mining too.. how many will accept irregular payouts - especially if they can just switch to one of the larger pools and get regular ones? I guess it somewhat depends on how much the large pools charge in fees.. from a 'control' perspective what matters is how many of the top pools do you need to get a majority of the hashing power.. the tail end of small pools isn't particularly important. If litecoin can get from say 2 or 3 to 8 or 12 pools needed for consensus that seems like potentially a step in the right direction.. In a way the whole decentralization thing is an illusion either way - governments are quite capable of infiltrating or corrupting 12 pool operators and the development team and doing it subtly enough that noone will notice anyway.

maybe.. two slovenians already commented here which isn't bad considering how small slovenia is.. also bitstamp should be relatively easy for them to use (support presumably speaks slovene and easy local bank transfers). I guess the crisis would need to be engineered in a very specific way to drive people into BTC though.

I think it's pretty relevant - most btc-e users are there to buy altcoins that they get by selling bitcoin. It does create an opportunity for arbitrage but I guess not many people are competing in that space. Pretty funny the only right answer was downvoted, I'm guessing just for mentioning altcoins :p

mainly because of variance.. some days they won't find any blocks.. without a large capital buffer they won't always be able to make regular payments..

There might be other advantages of having more blocks -- the main one I see is it will allow there to be a larger number of mining pools and thus less centralized control. Bitcoin is probably always going to be dominated by 3 large pools -there aren't really enough blocks to support more than 10 or 15.. litecoin could have 4x as many potentially..
On the other hand there could well be problems with block propagation with faster blocks there can't be as many node hops between the edges of the network.. if there can't be many node hops then the mining pool nodes at least basically need to be connected directly together which makes the network more centralized again.

my gut instinct is that because everyone now mines in pools and the funds are immediately swept to the accounts of the various pool participants that the block count has no real bearing on the number of funded keys.
infact - the bitcoin stats are significantly inflated by unmoved early solo-mined blocks (especially the 'satoshi' wealth). litecoin has pretty much been pool mined since day one.
I think that whatever the figure is, the number of litecoin users is probably significantly underestimated by most observers and the bitcoin numbers overestimated. Also the absolute numbers of usere we're talking about here are so low that they could very well be overtaken by some new thing that comes along.

arrange a p2p bank deal on localbitcoins - or irc or similar... then a few weeks later the account holder notices and the btc seller gets screwed as the bank attempts to reverse the payments.

bitcoins don't require a physical delivery address and while in theory the police could track bitcoin transactions I don't think there's a single police department in the world that has even tried to yet.
Probably the national security agencies are looking into it, but they probably won't answer the phone for some guy who had his bank account emptied.

Bitcoin is still hardly being used by anyone.. probably less than 200k users although more have probably tried it at least once.
Litecoin for example has probably around 60k users - certainly a lot less.. but then again not so much less and it's probably easier for bitcoin users to also become litecoin users than it is to recruit brand new crypto-currency users.
Litecoin does lack in merchant support - but if someone like bitpay adopted litecoin or some other cryptocurrency suddenly bitcoin would lose a lot of that advantage.
Bitcoin certainly has the most mindshare (and media coverage totally disproportional to it's actual economic activity) and if it gets things like ISO codes allocated and more integration with the legacy banking system then maybe it will end up far in the lead. That hasn't happend yet.

could be.. it's hard to tell.. i get those numbers from looking at the number of keys holding btc and ltc.. possibly litcoin users (being perhaps more 'into' crypto currencies) have more keys than your average bitcoin user? if you look at the subscribers it's almost exactly 10% of the subscribers.
