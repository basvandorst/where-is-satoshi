in short, STG's are taxed at a higher rate, and LTG's are taxed at a reduced rate.
proving LTG's with BTC is going to be a little tricky, but you basically need to have rock solid proof that you acquired them on X date, and sold them at Y date. thus, &gt; 1 year and qualifying for LTG treatment. it's possible, just not as easy as a traditional security.

CPA Here, this checks out, the only thing I wish to add to this would be that please be as conservative as you can with filing your taxes with BTC Gains. 
Why? because the dust has not completely settled on BTC, and maybe it will be treated as a foreign currency, but more likely than not, its going to be treated the way of capital gains. 
This may mean nothing, but if it gets classified as FX, it will be easier to get a refund vs potentially paying penalties. 
Another reason is that because this is so new, you want to shine as much good light on it as you can. BTC seen as responsible tax paying people bs BTC seen as a way to dupe the government out of their share is two viewpoints which have significant input on how it is treated in future legal transactions. 
basically, just lean on the side of caution, for anyone making serious enough gains to report it, congrats, but don't let your greed bring you into tax evasion.

Putting all your eggs in one basket regardless of medium is a really terrible idea. Your money not mine but seriously reconsider putting your entire life savings into it

Right now, no one really knows how to treat bitcoin, by taking an approach as an investment you can take the proper care and diligence, if ruled as different you can defend that you did your best at the time to follow all rules and change later

I think you u missed the bigger point of my thread. 
My opinion is that when an investment makes an incredibly large return (for me 3x over would do but I deal with stocks mostly)  you should consider cashing out and enjoying your fruits. 
My opinion, not advice, 
My advice was how to handle you tax burden should you cash out

the last point is not entire correct, in your own company, you can pay yourself whatever you want and no one will bat an eye. 
if you pay yourself a salary of 20k with $500k invested, it would just be a transaction. What he is trying to get at would be starting an LLC that make no sense and is a clear picture of tax evasion. 
for example, you start a rental company, and buy 3 houses in tropical locations, and never rent out a single one, then claim them all as expenses to lower your taxable income. 
any effort being made to avoid taxes will be labelled as tax evasion, with a new currency that the gov does not know how to handle is likely to be treated with swift harsh punishment so rather then setting a bad example, take a 15% lump on the noggin in the form of long-term cap gains and set the opposite example - which is, BTCers can be taken seriously, and they are choosing to play by the rules.

Look, my OPINION would be that you should at some point cash out and my personal rule for myself is being happy with small gains over the course, I understand not everyone is going to share my views and I'm OK with that.  
But the meat and potatoes of my post is to give out advice for people who do want to cash out and what they need to be thinking about should they do it.  
My opinion should not discredit me what I said outside my opinion is fact.

is blockchain a bad site to have my BTC's on? it seemed like a decent site but are there better ones?
My BTC goal is that of a savings account, put in now -&gt; cash out in a few years, with no real activity going on

Cpa here, 
While your logic is correct, your execution is poor and you would be convicted of income tax evasion, not avoidance.  
Forming an llc to mitigate taxes is a smart idea,  however u can't just make a company and buy toys, you need to actually run a biz. 
Want real estate? Form a rental company,  and rent out your house u want to make it legit.  
Even better practice? Start up IRAs, coverdells and plan for your kids college educations. Tax planning cam save you a lot in taxes but you will have pay the tax man something.  
Quickest and best tip I can give you? Hold your coins for &gt;1 year as long term cap gains are taxed significantly less than short terms. 
Again Ur logic is sound, but execution needs work 
Sorry for the shitty type, i am on my phone
