Yes, I have been saying it for months now. We must hope.

I'm a fan of the contact form.
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:20:39
I like them.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:42:24
The video gives a broad overview of what is to come.
@_date: 2015-08-24 19:50:38
Agreed. If you're going to type something in, at least make it worthwhile.

"Governments should not be involved in money, just as they ought not be involved in speech, religion, or interpersonal relationships. Governments’ involvement in money has caused immense distortions in markets, and is an affront to the idea of a free society."
Couldn't agree more.

How many bitcoin do you own?
@_date: 2016-09-22 01:48:01
CoinBase support has also been unresponsive for me as well.

Welcome to the future and the 'Internet of Money'!

Very interesting. I have been saying this for a while now, off-chain centralization is no the way to go, but things will improve with decentralization.

Some of these technologies are particularly interesting. I'm not sure if they would upload fungibility, but I would much rather use this to accept payments than a centralized service such as BitPay.

Bitcoin can be considered a valid hedge against economic uncertainty "precisely because it operates by a different form of law."

Savings in fiat is apparently the root of all evil ...

Such excellent news and considering it is 0% fees will only help bolster bitcoin sales.
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:17:45
Sweetness! Will crack into this ... looks promising.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:54:08
Drunk on bitcoin perhaps.
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:36:33
People worship the dollar as a false idol.
People dislike bitcoin because it challenges this false idol while simultaneously not understanding it.

Very interesting. A virus that thrives and grows when fed computing power.
Muhahahahaaa!
