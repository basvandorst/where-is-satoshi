Hoarding btc and not using them, not making transactions with them is a bit selfish. Btc will take off through transactions, not by sitting for 30 years in a wallet. I believe there should have been a chronological decrease in value implemented in the protocol as is the case with most local/alternative currencies.
I understand OP's logic &amp; initiative but ultimately I see btc as a militant "f**k all the bloodsucking middlemen" project. I save wealth in metals. I try to sell &amp; exchange in btc as much as possible.
We all hope they'll go up &amp; up &amp; up but ultimately the *value* of btc will be determined by its recognition as a useful exchange medium by the masses, not by hoarders. Imho, if you have 30k$ in btc that's fine, just be grateful and try to use a bit of that cash to help keeping it alive. 
Again, nothing beats metals for value storage, and in the forseeable future nothing will. It's been 5000 years...

 " You'll know bitcoin's boat has sailed when we're struggling to find uses for bitcoin beyond narcotics trading, gambling, porn and buying bitcoins simply because of the belief they are going to be worth more in the future without a concrete reason as to why."
This comment is what I'm saying, basically it is up to the users to turn btc into something that's not ostracized as "grey market tender" or "hopium hashes"...
Again nothing agaisnt OP, all I'm saying is dem coins be changing hands thatz all.
