Lol, fuck you, there are thousands of important issues around the world that need to be addressed and he was kind enough to donate to Sens as well instead of ignoring it completely,  and here you are saying that bullshit.
If anyone reads your comment it'll only discourage them from donating to Sens, prick.

Then by all means why don't you sell your organs to the highest bidder and leave in your will that 100% of your money will go to Sens? It is the for the bigger good, for humanity, if all of you Sens supporters(the ones that act like you do) did that i'm sure they'll raise much more money. Hypocrite.

So apparently all that article is saying is that by the time the problem of ageing is solved there would also be good enough technology to produce food in a much smarter way and make it possible for people all around the world to be properly fed, however how is this supposed to happen if you want ALL the money to go towards this project and towards nothing else? By linking that article you just acknowledge what i have stated about overpopulation, you're just saying, "yeah, overpopulation is a bigger problem than ageing right now, but read this, it'll get better".
Also i have a spent a good part of the last hour reading about the project and it sounds like such a load of bullshit and empty promises.
How many people die of malnutrition and starvation each day? How many people die of X reasons each die? Compare those different reasons to ageing and ageing will be at the bottom of the list. It is not the "most urgent problem" we have right now. You're crazy.
