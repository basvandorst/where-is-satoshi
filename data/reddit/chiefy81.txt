@_date: 2015-12-18 16:38:16
The incentive structures are bitcoin (the currency) based. Including block rewards and transactions fees. If bitcoins were not worth much and the assets being traded over it were, that would incentivize a disproportionate amount of resources to attack bitcoin to affect/steal/whatever the asset layered over bitcoin
@_date: 2015-12-23 14:46:54
Youre assuming that bitcoin only goes up in value if people are spending it. That is not the only reason. If people hold it (speculatively or not) that will also increase the value.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:03:55
The increased transactions (and thus transaction fees) help secure the network. What is not clear is that the total value of the transaction fees will be "enough" relative to the value of the assets on the blockchain (and thus the incentive to attack). It may, it may not be. 
This is especially a concern if the assets being added to the blockchain are NOT frequently traded. I get that the OP was about a high volume system, but no one is guaranteeing the volume or types of assets or values. Meaning the transaction volume could be low and value high. That combination could be an incentive to attack bitcoin.

Makes me wonder how one would go about such an analysis. There would be a good amount of guesswork. I could put a counterparty token representing my consulting services for example, which no one would know (or care about) the value of unless it is on an exchange.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:53:39
If the value of bitcoin goes down, that means less miners putting less resources towards securing the network in general.
An increase in # of transactions (and thus fees to miners) from increased utility via additional assets on the blockchain *may* be enough to sustain the network. But it may not either. 
The more detached that the value stored in the blockchain that isnt a bitcoin asset relative to the value of bitcoin based assets, the disproportionately stronger the incentive to attack the network.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:30:26
If the assets being traded on the bitcoin blockchain are not bitcoin the incentive structures can get messed up.

Im not concerned with bitcoin being labeled as "money". It is not an interesting label to me. 
People are using bitcoin to pay for things. That is real. 
1. I dont care anything about barter. bitcoin has speculative interest. that is all.
2. You are using network to mean hardware. bitcoin's "network" doesnt mean that: 
3. Doesnt matter how many people you think are using bitcoin for circumventing governments. or why. the fact is _some_ people are.
4. Doesnt matter how many people value it highly. _some_ people do. thus there is value to it to them.


If these people exist, I dont see them very often, if ever.

@_date: 2017-02-24 13:49:38
Those are not values you list for gold. Those are potential uses. Those uses are valuable to some people and not others. Thus the value of those potential uses is subjective. 
Bitcoin has potential uses as well. Speculation. A payment network for the internet. The ability to circumvent government controls and send Bitcoin to anyone or take it anywhere. These uses are also potentially valuable to people. But also subjective. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 15:15:26

@_date: 2016-01-28 23:04:02
The Shift card allows more of my wealth to be stored in bitcoin. Before, I would need to keep more money in traditional fiat bank accounts in USD because I needed it to pay bills, etc. With Shift I can transfer all those USD into BTC for storage and then, as needed, transfer back to USD at the time of purchase. This means I am holding more % of my wealth in BTC because of Shift than I was before. I suspect others are in the same boat. This means more people holding more BTC. That is not "nothing for bitcoin". It means increased demand.

I don't believe that to be true. I mean. People are always seeking happiness but that doesn't always mean seeking solely profit. Happiness can come from an apple or giving to charity. 
This happiness seeking nature seems undeniable. What other reason would someone act?
There is no benevolence. People act because they prefer consequences of that act over other possible acts. 
Do you think satoshi created bitcoin because he DIDNT want to create bitcoin? That doesn't make sense. 
He (she they) created bitcoin because they wanted to. Because they preferred its existence in the world to it not existing. 
Why? Who knows. It could be that satoshi derives happiness from seeing the world closer to the way he wanted it to be. A world with bitcoin. 
Whatever the motivation was, the real _underlying_ motivation is _always happiness_ for ones self.

Only if people choose to report it. Believe it or not people sometimes avoid governmental rules.

Selling bitcoin for dollars would be very hard to avoid paying taxes. 
This is my entire point. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:47:41


Sorry but this is how bitcoin works. Nodes have power in the network. If you want power in the bitcoin network, this is one way.


Again, this is how the bitcoin network works. Miners get some power.


Bitcoin doesnt care about your opinions. You seem to want some direct democracy with an equal-vote-for-each-man of sorts. That is not what bitcoin is. You need to have value or work behind your opinions for them to matter.


Holding bitcoin affects the price. Buying more creates upward pressure. Selling downward pressure. Your buying and selling is your voting. Directly affecting bitcoin prices and bitcoin itself potentially.


Ive given you some examples of "real" voting in bitcoin above. They have real effects on the bitcoin network. You are free to create something totally outside the system, somehow void of sybil attack and sock puppets. But whatever you come up with will only tangentially affect the bitcoin network, indirectly.

It is someone's fault that there is a lack of competition in this market. The US Government and those that continue to support their control have caused regulation that expensive or impossible to comply with.

@_date: 2015-08-06 13:32:02
The point is that it would be decentralized and peer to peer. That just means that no node is greater than any other node on the system. They can have a private system in which the nodes are peer to peer and distributed. They would do this for purposes of cutting security and compliance costs. Not because it is "Technically" more efficient.

Why couldn't a bank create its own blockchain with miners and nodes paid for by said bank for the purposes of managing its own internal accounting/transactions?

I agree with your drugs and regulatory arbitrage stance as I understand it. 
But I think you might underestimate non drug regulatory arbitrage value of bitcoin. 
Druggies don't care about bitcoin. I think you agree. They get in and out (heavy utilization of the payments function of bitcoin). Perhaps they are the drivers of payment related economics like block size and the transaction fees.  
But druggies contribute less to the value of bitcoin. They don't hold. And holding bitcoin contributes greatly to bitcoins value.

Save money on your Amazon purchases using purse.io. I regularly save 20% or more on my Amazon orders and have not had any issues. The cost saving is worth the extra time using purse.io. I just bought my fridge and dishwasher and got huge discounts. 
Buying and holding Bitcoin as an investment is also very common. The value went from $0.01 to now $600 per Bitcoin. Many expect it will go up in value so getting Bitcoin now instead of later enables you to profit from that appreciation in bitcoins value. You can use circle or coinbase to do this if you live in the US. This is a bet on Bitcoins future. 
Finally, you can hold Bitcoin as a hedge against monetary interferences by governments. Bitcoin is hard to steal so if governments need money for their projects your Bitcoin are protected and cannot be confiscated. Also if governments decide to inflate their currency to pay off their pet projects your dollars will drop in value and your Bitcoin will go up in value.

"the takedown could make it both harder and riskier for criminals to cash out "
If this is true and the volume of criminal bitcoins being cashed out is substantial this is really bullish for the bitcoin price. It takes sellers out of the market and makes them hodlers.

Burn is a way to sell coins without anyone profiting from the sale. 
The XCP developers could have profited from the sale but chose not to by having coins sent to burn address.
Without someone sending coins "somewhere" (burn address) how could XCP have determined who gets what amount of coins?

Executing the strategy doesn't require future knowledge. 
The results are obviously never known and all investments don't know the result. This is a truism and could be said for anything investment related. But that is not the point I'm making. The point is execution only requires last information.

Bitcoins value is subjective since all value is subjective. 
People value bitcoin today for subjective reasons. Some of those reasons are drugs. Others are speculation or store of value. Or distrust of government. 
If people value those things in the next decade then bitcoin will stay relevant. Or grow in relevance.

You keep talking about the effectiveness of the strategy and whether it will, in the future, show results.
That is different than: "Follow these directions, buy when there is a long dip, hold forever". These are just instructions, not results. And the instructions can be followed with only past information.

Im not sure what all the hate is about.  You can buy now and if the price continues to go up just cancel.  If if stays the same or goes down (yay!) then you get the coins cheaper.  This method provides a hedge.

Im exploring an automated solution for this using a WHOIS lookup on the domain and then sending an automated email to the domain owner just for notification purposes.  They will still need the meta tag on the page to claim.
But the more effective route will be reaching out to the person you are donating to directly.  Will look less like spam, etc.

I am launching a service shortly that is very similar to what you are describing.  
Ive helped solve the problem of redemption by not requiring any people being donated TO to have an account, simply a meta tag with their bitcoin address on their page somewhere and the donations just flow into that account.
As others have pointed out the "account" aspect is a challenge given current bitcoin users makeup.  However, in order to offer the usability and features I had in mind, an account is required for people donating.  Im still on the fence about having the username be an email vs random username.
PM me if you want to be part of the beta.
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:18:30
Thanks.  Yes, other services could use that same meta tag.  Hope is to get website owners and website developers familiar with bitcoin in this way.  Layer services on top.

if you are using google authenticator, they provide "backup codes" for you to use/print.  each of these is a one time use code that can get you back logged in. 
Then you can "'Move to a different phone' and follow the instructions to configure the Authenticator app on your new phone"

I cannot comment on that issue other than Ive heard many times that could happen from a technical perspective.
