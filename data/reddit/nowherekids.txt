Gold is not a currency like Eur, Usd, Bitcoin

I laughed

I have been owning and using Bitcoin from years, I don't understand why people like you with this attitude own Bitcoin, honestly I hope it fails because of people like you

I know but I didn't understand the way you wrote it "thanks for the fud?"
It doesn't make sense
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:48:01
Bitcoin will go always up, so it's always a good time to invest, don't worry
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:21
I love you.

When people here aay hodl they mean: put your Bitcoin on a wallet and never touch them.
That's what they costantly suggest and that's what people do, listening to people here. For this subreddit and the majority of Bitcoin forum users hodl means that.

Do the math
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:11:07
If everyone would think like you we won't never solve anything.

Leave here

Use them, buy shit, move the Bitcoin market

I know that, but it's raising too fast, it seems forced

If it is really a bubble doesn't matter right now, I know that saying Bitcoin is a bubble is the current trend, but if it is, it will burn out in some years from now, so it's not matter of a bubble or not this actual price

I agree, one of the main point of Bitcoin is that unlike keeping money in bank you own them 100% and you can't lose them. Having them on an online wallet or exchange is like keeping money in bank.

Buy Bitcoin on a secure exchange, put them immediately to a wallet like Bitcoin core or electrum then use them like you use your currency to buy shit
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:37:20
Don't sell.

But at the same time I see Bitcoin going mainstream and I can't imagine a situation where everyone go broke because of Bitcoin, I really don't know what to think, time will tell
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:30:39
It says invalid address but I received the money on the Electrum wallet
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:02:46
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:42:52
It works like a charm, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:38:51
Electrum segwit wallet
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:33:32
That was intended, it's a meme
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:31:06
As we always say, if everyone hodl bitcoin will fail and I see that here hodling is normal. We need to spend them and make them circulate or rip
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:28:34
