No the overdraft was from a tab I usually pay in cash at the begining of the month. It's $150 on average. Instead of paying with cash I used my card the transaction took three weeks to clear which was weird. I bank with chase which I closed my account after this incident because they did something weird. Check my account $200 in the am. Get an email saying I overdrew my account look in account in pm realize there is $150 debt there. I only spend cash so this transaction was alittle weird to me wondering where the extra charges came from. Go into the bank to ask questions and no one can seem to tell me where the $350 charge came from. I normally only spend cash and try to stay away from debit cards because they don't always process the charge in the week I spent the money. On my part I'm normally very conscious of how much money I have. This also isn't the first time chase has somewhat screwed me without actually giving me a reason behind it. I once had a whole paycheck suspended indiffenitely, which I haven't received still, from a direct deposit from my work. Which makes no sense because its the same amount everyweek and from the same bank each time. Normally ill admit to my incompetence causing a situation. But this time I didn't recieve an explaination or couldn't even see the transaction in my account tht caused the overdraft. Just the 150 dollar charge resulting in my account that had 200 in it to be overdrawn by 150.

Why are you congratulating anyone? The problem isn't fixed. As much as I believe in btc. The large miners still have the ability to attack it whenever they want. It's a real problem and just cause one pool backed down doesn't mean anything. Just cause people moved their rigs or more likely farms to another pool ip or whatever doesn't mean anything. Just means In two weeks we will see the same shit. Here's the problem bitcoin will be come centralized if we don't solve this mining problem soon.

I also wanted to avoid using fiat by all means
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:48:14
Sorry for your loss bro but this happens everywhere not just on btc-e. there was something you did that resulted in this. The fact that your email was compromised and you didn't have 2fa set on your email is your bad. Not the exchanges. I'm sorry you lost your money man. I'd be livid too. But when it comes down to it. Your the one in charge of security for all your accounts. Not btc-e. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:48:04
Those two examples also aren't the only times chase has failed me. A while ago they had a database problem that resulted in all accounts saying they had a zero dollar balance. Well I lost money from that mishap and only received a $50 chase gift card in compensation. Normally I wouldn't complain about this cause banks are backed right and ill see compensation. But the last couple problems I've had haven't been compensated nor have I had any real explainations to what happened. I'm still out a $500 check that they haven't released to me.

Every time I go on the website with my phone I can't find the section it where it would be. Also their app doesn't have a private key section or import section
@_date: 2014-05-05 19:00:28
Lulz yup. Having $200 in your account and then a 150 dollar transaction causing your account to go to -$150 is pretty much my shitty math right.

Yeah but reputation and reputation alone won't stop someone from just taking off with someone else's money would it? I've read alot of people saying they haven't been paid back for their loans to people and there really isn't anything they can do they just took the chance and now they are out coins. Idk just seems alittle sketch. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:20:21
Before getting into any mining you should look up the costs of rig difficulty projection as well as energy costs. Almost all of the time it's cheaper and more cost effective to buy the coins you are interested in. I spent 1300 on a rig to mine scrypt coins average about 0.01 btc per day for about. 2 weeks then it dropped to about 0.004 per mh a day. It will take almost all year for me to make back my initial investment. Also by the time this drop in mh/btc/day happened scrypt asics hit the mining game. One of my cards gets 480khs a second and uses 1/4 of a 850 watt power supply. Well no with these asics I can get a little under my average hash rate with an asic that costs $200 and uses 12 watts of power. I'm not mad with my investment cause I have a bad ass gaming rig and multiple graphics cards to sell now or later. Before you buy mining equipment ask yourself do you just want to mine for a hobby or are you trying to see amount of btc (at least roi). Just saying. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 19:02:59
And also I stated I use gyft to make purchase alot of the week on the things I need completely removing my need for a debit card. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:58:35
Yup cause I don't have those things and don't plan on having those things for a good while or even ever
@_date: 2014-06-10 19:08:43
Well I don't know the fix. There was a link here yesterday talking about a possible solution to 51% attacks. But really I don't see anything good coming from these mining pools. Especially ones that were allowed as a community to get as large as they have. Until we can create a force that can shutdown giant pools when they nee to be limited were stuck at a trust system. As far as I'm concerned ghash already owns at least 60% of btcs network hash rate. It's just never displayed like that. Yeah I don't have proof to back up these claims but seeing how easy it is for then to approach 50% I'm guess it's not like they don't have the ability to totally fork the block chain. Us as a community need to stop posting this ghash is evil shit and start actually looking at ways to get btc to evolve past only pow. I mean I hate referencing alt coins but ppc honestly looks more safe as in terms of double spending and working about network hash rate. I love bitcoin I stopped keeping money in my bank except for what I spend in a week. I only hold cold storage btc and some gold. But honestly I knew from the time btc hit 1k that eventually if its pow wasnt altered it would end up being a race between pools to get the most hash rate which spells disaster

As a response:
There is no way to relAte btc to terrorism. "(;But all currency and digital; or virtual currncey can be used in the efforts of supporting a non~ "ish" establishment organization.

Thanks for your advice man. As I said I spend bitcoin every week the risk isn't that big to me. Money comes and goes and my job isn't my only income. Coming from being homeless and putting myself through high school and finding an actuall career I've come to terms with how I deal with my financial life. As well as the gambles I take daily. I've been buying btc since it was $80 honestly the price moving up and down ~$100 doesn't bother me. Yeah btc could fail and drop to nothing and I'd be out some money but eh that's life man. I've come to terms with that and savings wise I have enough to feel comfortable continuing to buy btc at the rate I am.

@_date: 2013-12-18 09:57:34
i think your unreasonable, do you have proof you "canceled" the transaction? coinbase only allows you to cancel your transaction within the first couple minutes of starting it, it has nothing to do with when they go to take the money out of your account. just cancel the transaction through your bank if your this upset. just be prepared to not be allowed to buy from coinbase anymore

Understandable completely btc is te Wild West right now. Anyone could have malicious intents. My goal is to get people started with a secure, heavy understanding of the security process to keep their coins safe. It's important to think about all the scams and people that have been ripped off. I can understand a lot of senior btc'ers wouldn't want this service, or maybe they would. I think it's all up in the air. Right now I'm looking to start a safety net fund to protect clients before starting this, I also have a family lawyer writing me some contracts for free which is a big help. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:17:11
I'm sure there are plenty of people who would want to listen to a podcast about that. Find a stable place and do weekly shows man. You can do it. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:06:59
As far as managing funds go I'd basically set up a system that shows accounts, investment amount if each account, a stop loss for each account at a client decided percent, and wallet transfers from secure cold storage to hot wallets over an encrypted network and fresh installs every transaction to ensure coins from being lifted. As well as setting up portfolios for a percentage to be put on an exchange if the client wished to do so. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 15:43:19

heres what you decide. pay a premium to get your coins now, wait a while to get coins, or chose another option. if you really want coins and think btc will go back to 1000 or more than whats it matter if your paying a 10% premium? really its not a big deal in the long run. 
instant buy
multiple sources to buy from
almost anon

there ya go. chose what your gunna do and decide if youd rather go through other routes or get coins today.

Idk if this helps I hand out fliers once aweek to local businesses about the benefit of using bitcoin for merchants. I also hand them out at large shopping areas to people to inspire them to ask what's a bitcoin. Start like that an then have a qr on it that links to your business contact and start from there. I sell bitcoins on craigslist my first week I sold ten. I wasn't expecting that but it just ones to show you if you place one foot forward it leads to a marathon

Thanks for your response I definitely think they have to change the link I posted if there's no way to cancel a purchase. I mean I can always deny the transfer from my bank but I like using coinbase and don't wanna do anything they'd see as shady. If only there support didn't take a week to get back to me everytime I had a problem. Well thanks for the back and fourth we shall see what happens. Either way I don't mind losin some money from this purchase. I just was qurious about the cancel button they stated in the FAQ link I posted earlier. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:28:41

im all for letting people know what they need to look out for, but couldn't this be avoided by simply not keeping your btc on a web wallet or in someone other than  your own possession? shouldnt people start taking it upon themselves to not rely on 3rd part services when it comes to btc, thats kinda the whole concept of bitcoin. I love coinbase (except how they cant verify my id) but people should realize that these things are bound to happen when you rely on someone other than yourself. idk just my two cents.
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:44:57

That's a brilliant question. I need more of these questions so I can bring it up to the people I have lined up for investments. My plan was to keep private keys 100% offline and have copies of private keys kept in offline and encrypted. I was also thinking of investing in the new cold storage printer. As far as private key privacy goes I'm still going to need to figure out a way to ensure only one person besides the buyer ever sees it. I planned on using lament and stickers to cover private qr and key from employees. Obviously there are some holes to fill but for the most part me and the few people I have on board wouldn't want any form of negative review and understand that keeping info and privacy at the highest regards is the key to this being successful. Any ideas? I'm all ears  
@_date: 2013-09-13 18:52:36
Whenever I explain btc to anyone who has no idea of the concepts or the way value is determined I explain it like this. The usd is really only a piece of paper. It has value because we put value and faith in it. If no one thought the dollar was worth anything anymore people wouldn't use it. Same goes for btc

Just make a blockchain.info wallet it worked flawlessly for me I then sent to coinbase and then cashed our. I was worried my coins got sent and coinbase lost them
