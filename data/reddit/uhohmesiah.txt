I'm updating now, as I'v had the same problem. Should I 'replace existing file' or keep both? Please and thanks!

It solves the problem of tickets being able to be reproduced by patrons. And if you are organising a gig/party you wouldn't need a third-party ticketing agent.

So that's it then? Whatever was held at Gox is gone for good?! It's not too late for a bit of optimism right. ... Right!?

Are the listed prices the discounted price? Or is there a further discount once paying with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-09-11 17:31:34
Way to dodge the last question. Ha.

Great post, bad title.

Using the ticketing example. One could create real-world, unique physical tickets by printing QR codes on paper? 
Therefore bypassing all this coloured coin talk for the uninitiated and basically handing over a QR coded ticket for cash...
Yay, nay?

If lost or stolen can funds be accessed and removed? 
To carry one on my person will I effectively need 2 cards? One with BIP38 and one public only? Not understanding the FAQ on this 100%...
There is also a grammatical errir in; "What happens if I lose or damage my Crypto Card?"

What a lot of you "you were such an idiot to keep funds in MtGox" people don't realise is; that for some people MtGox was **the only viable option** to actually purchase and trade coins. 
We were not all spoilt for choice of exchanges years and even months ago.

Imagine being able to donate to your favourite fighters fight prize-pool. Or  the knock-out of the night award. Possibilities are pretty exciting.

Just jumped on the new site last night. Looks good and quick. Just lacking players for most games over 0.2 /0.4 blinds. All in good time I guess

It's back up. 
And artwork is cool, except most of the clothing has the word "swag" on it - ugh. And could be more orientated toward crypto designs..

Exactly. There will most likely be a better solution than Bitcoin in the future... Someday, ^in ^the ^very ^distant ^future...

Awesome. Hope it comes to fruition!

This comment has persuaded my dad to invest for the first time in his life (he's 56 and for the first time in his life has some disposable income), it won't be much, but it is a start. Thank you.

Regardless if there are any direct changes or not, it might at least motivate one or two other people and therefore would have done some good. They are worthwhile keystrokes homie. What else you got to do today?

Cool. Liking the "Stumble" idea!
