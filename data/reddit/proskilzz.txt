Basically what I did was download the bitaddress.org website on my macbook, and then go offline on the same mac, and ran the website (offline) and created a brain wallet with an entropy of 300+ and the phrase is very personal contains number, Capitals, and other signs. How does that sound????
The only risk I feel I face is that someone is spying on my macbook with a key logger, but thats highly unlikely with Macs. plus if it was the case they would have stolen all the other things on my mac.

I found these adresses after reading an article about a guy who ran a pastry store, and his wife sold a pastry and lemonade to Satoshi himself, looking at the transaction details I found these adresses. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:55:40
Where do you have your store? 
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:25:32
I want to know the answer too. As getting coins on local bitcoin there is a 15% used by most people.

Hello Again everyone :) I'm still sticking to keeping my BTC in a brainwallet, this time around I made a new one, the phrase is alot longer now, and has additional number. I'm choosing a brain wallet because I don't like to deal with with paper wallets and having to print them. This time around I created my brain wallet in Mac Recovery mode (offline), by opening an html bitcoin address page from a usb :) 
Thanks for all your advice guys, you have really helped me to grow my knowledge about bitcoin.

Think about it as metal like gold but its not pretty and can't be used for jewelry, but its a superb store of value. Now here comes the best part, imagine if this metal could be sent through the internet cable to anyone world wide for 3cents in seconds. Revolution!!
@_date: 2015-04-10 01:32:52
amazing, 
@_date: 2015-04-17 04:15:52
Hey Matt, yes I have heard about your product, its a great idea. 
Whats missing is the ability to store these vouchers that you fill with bitcoin, I wish I could load bitcoin to a barcode, and have it for use at the store and then later whenever I choose, just like a starbucks card. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 02:53:52
