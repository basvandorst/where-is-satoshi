What do you mean? I can't send money, so my problem is not that i have no confirmation, i can't send btc by the mentioned error. I have used this wallet every day til now without this error. Or i don't understand what spending you mean? What i spent for example in two days ago, it is ok. The problem is i can't spend BTC. Just get this error: "Missing inputs" when i try to make a transaction! I do not find any about this error in google. I even tried to make a raw transaction, but when i broadcasted id, i get the same error. Simple i can't believe that nobody had this issue. It is very frustrating.

Sorry, but maybe i'm too noob, but i just want to send the BTC to a blockchain wallet. What do i have to check i that wallet. I made about 2-300 same transactions previously and i have never checked the output address. And the error is "Missing Inputs", so i don't think there is any problem with the output wallet. And of course i tried to send to different output wallets. The only different now as i seen, that i have made a transaction two days ago from this coinb wallet, which is still pending because of the high fee/too many transactions! I don't think it does matter, but only this is the only different now.

Thanks for trying to help me. I solved it with viabtc broadcaster. I made the raw transaction in coinb, also signed with coinb than broadcasted with viabtc and the transaction sent from my wallet.
Don't think it is a permanently solution, because i still want to use coinb, but maybe i set an other multisig wallet. Thanks again for your kindness.
