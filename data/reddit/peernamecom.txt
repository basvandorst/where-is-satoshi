You pushed all the channel balance to the other side. That's why you can not send payments via this channel. You can only receive.

It needs time to collect and estimate data. Leave it running for a while.
It is also very important to shut down the node properly. Wait for the shutdown message to disappear. This is when the node is saving all the estimation data to the disk for future uses.

We had the same problem. Most fiat payment processors are not working with blockchain-based businesses. So we are accepting only crypto.
