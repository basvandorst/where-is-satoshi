Should have thought of that before naming it Bitcoin Cash..

I think the biggest issue is barrier to entry. Granted that the original design was to allow incentives for the miner community to guide the value of Bitcoin in a way that would reflect the free market, it seems that with a saturated market miners are going to follow profit and they have the ability to sway the price enough to impact the populous. In order to influence the mjning community one must become the community and commit to an altruistic vision of what can be. That being said I would hope that those that belong to the Bitcoin community close the knowledge gap from those who wish to hijack it.

Thank you so much!!! I couldn't get my node running for more than a few hours at a time due to the initial sync and timeouts. You have inspired me to give an Rpi node another shot. Faith in r/Bitcoin restored

The value of any currency is the purchasing power of said currency. The market valuation today is in how many USD or EUR , etc can our bitcoins purchase, which is a bad way to value a given currency and most likely stems from the fact that there is no infrastructure governing it's value;however, this is also the benefit. In essence, the more merchants that accept the coins the more value the Bitcoin will achieve as the purchasing power of the currency will then be based on the value of the goods being traded. Therefore trading Bitcoin for goods and services in the short term will increase the volume trades and value in the long run.

Fair enough. Just thought it would be a convenient way to get it directly to someone who needs it, but I suppose you are right.

First off all.. Puerto Rico was exploited by the US and Spanish Governments for over 300 years which largley contributed to their financial state. Additionally, what people do with their Bitcoin is their choice, and helping people in need, regarless of where they live, is more Noble cause than spewing  smug, apathatic statements.

As much as I would love this to be true, I would love to see the scientific approach to reaching such a conclusion. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:08:09
This makes the most sense to me. As long as people refer to it as a commodity for exchange it will never truly be it's own currency.

Lol.. Tether
What backs Tether? US Dollar,
What Backs US Dollar? The Fed,
What backs the Fed? The Economy,
What backs the Economy? The Fed,
What backs the Fed? The Economy,
..and round and round we go.

Mostly Scarcity. All things are intrinsic ly worthless, true value is based on supply and demand.

There should be wallet settings for small change threaholds to donate to BTC Devs. Like if my change is .00000010 I don't mind shit like that continuously being donated instead of going to a new return addressed
