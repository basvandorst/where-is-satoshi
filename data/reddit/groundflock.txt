There we see nothing...
i want to see a real TX ID with 1 Bitcoin transferred for 1$ 
not a screenshot from a not completed transaction. if you have no 1 BTC you cant see how much it costs!

thank you all for Reply.
For Security:
i use in TitaniumBackup Pro for every App-Backup an RSA-4096 encryption, with an ultra long key. i think it will be near impossible to decrypt it and get the coins from the jaxx wallet.
Also available for Android is "Blockchain-Wallet" i tested this app and backed it up on the first android device with coins on it and restored it on second device with coins on it, works fine with TitaniumBackup.
For better security maybe its better to backup the CryptoApps without data. and store the keys separately with other encryption. 
The keystore function was unknown to me.
it will be a lesson to me to trifle with those bitcoin apps

Thank you  for your answer. but i was confident that TitaniumBackup restore the Breadwallet with all the Data. The Other Wallet Jaxx was restored successful by TitaniumBackup with all bitcoins and altcoins.
I have restored the Phone to factory settings, cuz of an error in android. before reset i backup all the system data and apps with titanium backup. Also the Android ID is the same before factory reset. Now i have restored everything. All apps are working. but only Breadwallet tells: 
"KeyStore Error - Failed to load KeyStore. Please try again later or enter your phrase to recover your Breadwallet now."
Maybe i can recover a file that was not backed up by titaniumbackup and is recommendet forbreadwallet. Maybe with any recovery software that restores deleted data for android. but where should i search.
