Hi BegottenHickory, the Android version of Coinomi uses its own keyboard instead of the system one exactly to prevent "smart" keyboards from learning and transmitting your seed. It doesn't "spellcheck" the words, according to what you type it suggests words from the BIP39 list it has stored locally ([

Recovery phrases in Coinomi never had 16 words. That is an invalid length according to the bip39 specification.
A few years ago we used to generate phrases with 15 words, then we increased it to 18, and lately (a year ago maybe) updated versions of Coinomi generate phrases with 24 words. (all shorter phrases are still valid and can be restored normally, of course). 
So certainly your friend wrote down the phrase incorrectly. Depending on how long ago they created their wallet, they can have an idea of how many words is the correct amount. Either way, guessing the correct phrase is probably unfeasible...
Have them read our article that gives some tips on how to properly store the phrase. It also has some links that may help finding out what the correct phrase is:

The dynamic fees in Coinomi are sourced from Bitcoin Core's node software itself.

Do you mean coins other than BTC? Because BTC has had dynamic fees for months.
